@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 've been committed to each other for eight years and have four sons together , but there 's a component missing in one @entity8 , @entity1 , couple 's life that 's out of reach for them : getting married			0
@entity13 and @entity15 's partnership is one that has taken center stage because of the ongoing debate on same - sex marriage in @entity1			1
on monday , the spotlight will be even brighter , when a trial challenging @entity1 's @entity21 , which bans same - sex marriage , begins in @entity22 in @entity0			1
demonstrators are expected to be out in force			0
plans had been made to have a camera in the courtroom , and the proceedings distrubuted on @entity29 , but the ballot initiative 's sponsors prevailed in their 11th - hour bid to persuade the @entity34 @entity33 to restrict distribution of video of the trial -- at least temporarily			1
the justices wrote in their terse order that they need until at least wednesday afternoon to consider the camera issue			1
@entity44 and @entity15 , along with @entity41 and @entity42 , of @entity43 , are the two couples at the heart of the case , arguing that @entity1 's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional			1
they are asking chief judge @entity51 to issue an injunction against @entity21 's enforcement			2
the case will likely head to the @entity34 @entity33 no matter what the outcome			1
it is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years to come and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether @entity34 can marry people of the same sex			1
do you think prop 8 is constitutional ? in legal circles and across the @entity67 , it has been dubbed this generation 's @entity68 , the case that led to the @entity33 decision that outlawed segregation in schools			1
some say it could be the biggest ruling since @entity75 , which tackled abortion			0
it also closely echoes the @entity33 case that overturned bans on interracial marriage			1
the debate over @entity21 has been fueled by emotions on both sides			0
for @entity44 and @entity15 , @entity41 and @entity85 and their supporters , the issue is simple			2
they say the case boils down to nothing more than equal protection under the law and that their sexual orientation should not prevent them from getting married			2
" it does not weaken the fabric of our communities to grant them these basic familial rights -- it strengthens them , " said @entity96 , president of the @entity97 , when the lawsuit was announced in may			0
" it does not undermine marriage to extend to these loving couples -- it affirms it			1
" " this is one of the threshold civil rights issues of our generation , " he said			0
" justice is on our side and we 're about to reclaim it			0
" representing them are two high - powered attorneys , @entity119 and @entity120			2
they 're an unlikely pair -- former courtroom adversaries best known for being on opposing sides of the " hanging chad " dispute of the 2000 presidential election in @entity127			0
@entity129 , a staunch political conservative who defended the government 's positions as solicitor general , was a choice that surprised many supporters of the case for same - sex marriage			1
he said there 's nothing inconsistent about him fighting for the rights of same - sex couples			1
" they call it a teaching moment these days , " he said			0
" this gives us an opportunity to explain how wrong it has been to deny rights to individuals on that basis			0
" @entity154 @entity1 gov. @entity154 and the state 's @entity156 attorney general @entity155 are defendants in the lawsuit because of their positions in @entity1 government			0
however , both have said they would not defend the suit			0
@entity155 filed a legal motion saying he agreed with the position advanced by @entity129 and @entity120			0
@entity154 has taken no position			0
@entity167 , a lawyer for an organization called @entity167 , the group that came up with @entity21 , said he believes the issue was solved when the people of @entity1 made their voices heard in the voting booth			1
" seven million @entity1 voted to preserve or restore what marriage has meant since the beginning of time , " he said			2
" if they 're not permitted to do something as basic as that , then there 's something , really something , wrong with our system			0
" for @entity184 and supporters on his side of the issue , keeping the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is what makes sense			1
" marriage legally and socially has always been a social public institution that affects far more than the adults involved , " he said			2
" we are taking a position that society has a very good reason for limiting marriage the way it does			2
... the relationship of a man and woman bears a relationship to child - rearing that no other relationship can duplicate			2
" the @entity21 vote is part of a long line of seesaw rulings , court cases , debates and protests in @entity1 over the issue			2
after @entity1 's @entity219 approved same - sex marriages , voters took to the polls in november 2008 ; a slim majority -- 52 percent -- approved of banning the marriages			1
in may 2009 , @entity1 's highest court upheld the ban , but allowed about 18,000 unions performed before the ban to remain valid			2
for same - sex couples , especially those who did not get married before the ban , the ruling was hardly comforting			1
several liberal celebrity activists , led by former director and actor @entity233 , have bankrolled the first federal challenge to the voter - approved ban on gay marriage			1
the nation 's eyes will be on the court 's eventual ruling			0
@entity129 and @entity120 said they believe the case is simple based on their reading of the @entity34 @entity246			1
" the first thing to think about is the right to marry is a fundamental right in the @entity34 , " @entity247 said			1
" it 's a right protected by the @entity246			0
the @entity33 has held over and over again that it may be one of the most fundamental rights to unite with the person you love to form a partnership			0
" for @entity120 , the case follows a sad tradition in @entity34 history : the denial of rights to people because certain groups blindly see them as undeserving			1
" this lawsuit is about the courts saying no matter how blind people may be , the @entity246 guarantees that everyone deserves the equal rights that every human being is entitled to , " @entity120 said			0
" and we go to court because that is the place those equal rights have been established time and again over the last 100 years			0
" @entity2 @entity33 producer @entity276 contributed to this story .			0
