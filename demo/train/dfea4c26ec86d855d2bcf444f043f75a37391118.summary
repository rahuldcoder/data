-- @entity2 's first grab at power occurred 42 years ago in the eastern @entity5 city of @entity6 , when he led a crew of fellow military officers in taking over key government institutions on his way to usurping the nation 's monarchy			1
ever since , he 's referred to himself as the @entity13 -- though politically , at least , @entity5 has appeared to be largely stable , with few threats to @entity2 's power			1
but that all changed this past week , with reports that tens of thousands took to the streets calling for an end to @entity2 's rule			1
and , once again , that change began in @entity6			1
@entity0 has been unable to independently confirm information on the escalating unrest in @entity5 , the most isolated nation in the region			2
the government has not responded to repeated requests from @entity0 for access to the country and maintains tight control over communications			2
still , phone interviews with witnesses and others on the ground suggest that some of @entity2 's strongest opposition has been in @entity6 , where protests began and have escalated			1
since then , there have been indications that the opposition movement has spread westward toward the capital @entity42			2
why @entity2 suddenly came under fire after decades of a strong - handed , seemingly stable rule remains a question			1
one obvious factor is that @entity5 borders @entity47 , where popular unrest last month helped unseat authoritarian president @entity50 @entity49 after more than two decades in power			1
weeks later , a similar movement contributed to the end of @entity56 president @entity55 's 30 - year rule			2
@entity2 is far from alone now			1
anti-government protests have popped up all around the @entity59 world , with pressure growing on powerful leaders in places like @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
but what makes @entity5 unique , in large part , is its colorful , controversial and powerful leader			2
@entity2 was a captain in @entity5 's army when , on september 1 , 1969 -- which is referred to as @entity71 in @entity5 -- he and others launched the coup by assuming control of key institutions in @entity6			1
the overthrow was completed in two hours , according to @entity77 , an independent provider of security information			0
at the time , the @entity79 had military aircraft at @entity81 in @entity5			2
and @entity84 did not initially oppose the coup , a 2008 @entity83 report noted			2
@entity2 soon established himself as one of @entity79 's most vocal , and flamboyant , enemies			1
by 1972 , @entity2 urged @entity88 to fight the @entity79 and @entity89 and vowed support for black revolutionaries in @entity79			1
the next year , he launched a program " to destroy imported ideologies , whether they are eastern or @entity96 , " a @entity93 timeline noted			0
in 1979 , the @entity79 designated @entity5 as a state sponsor of terrorism			0
the relationship only worsened in the 1980s , when @entity79 military aircraft shot down two @entity5 fighter jets			2
@entity5 's alleged attacks in @entity102 , support for @entity106 's @entity105 government and role in the bombing of a @entity110 nightclub only further stoked the ire of the administration of @entity79 president @entity113 , who called @entity2 a " mad dog			1
" @entity5 's standing took a turn with the 1988 bombing of @entity118 over @entity119 , @entity120 , killing 270 people			0
world pressure intensified on @entity42 after @entity5 intelligence agents were implicated			0
by 1993 , @entity2 told the @entity124 that he was taking a more conciliatory approach to world affairs			1
he called @entity79 president @entity127 " the savior of the new world , " and decried @entity129 militants as " mad dogs " and " terrorists			0
" @entity127 continued to keep pressure on @entity5 , signing a law imposing sanctions on companies that invested more than $ 40 million in that nation 's petroleum industry			0
by 1999 , @entity5 finally agreed to transfer the @entity141 103 suspects for a trial in the @entity143 , leading to their conviction two years later			2
while still known for sometimes unconventional comments , @entity2 appeared to evolve into more of a statesman -- at least internationally			1
in 2009 , he was elected by member states as head of the @entity149			0
that year , he also addressed the @entity151 ' @entity150 for the first time			0
still , he proved to be more a firebrand than an even - keeled diplomat , delivering a blistering , wide - ranging 96 - minute rant			0
his topics ranged from the @entity157 to the assassination of @entity79 president @entity159 to a one - state solution for @entity161 and @entity162 : isratine			0
@entity2 blamed the @entity151 for failing to prevent 65 wars since its founding in 1945			1
but he also had kind words for @entity79 president @entity168 : " we are content and happy if @entity168 can stay forever as the president of @entity79 , " @entity2 said			1
while @entity2 seemed to take on a new role internationally , the world had few insights into what was happening inside @entity5 itself			1
even as the @entity151 , the @entity79 and other nations gradually began to soften their stance on @entity5 , reports suggested that freedom and basic rights remained widely restricted under @entity2			1
" he has n't changed , " said @entity180 , a professor at @entity181			0
" this is a monster			0
and the @entity5 people are suffering from this			0
" the government maintained a tight control over its communications , clamping down on news accounts critical of @entity2 and his colleagues			1
it also restricted outside media access , including denying repeated requests from @entity0 to enter the country this month			2
on friday night , @entity5 authorities shut down the nation 's access to the internet , the @entity79 - based tech firm @entity194 reported			0
while there have been indications of spotty web coverage since , @entity5 sent out a text message warning about the " inappropriate use of telecommunications services			0
" @entity206 political dissent was largely and often violently squashed			0
@entity207 , an anti-government protester who did not give his full name for security reasons , said @entity2 " always plays on fear " -- relying on a broad network of intelligence agents , secret police and others			1
" he makes you afraid of your family , of your friends , " @entity207 told @entity0			0
" he will tell you that his secret police are everywhere			0
" and yet , despite the odds , people have still risen up this month against @entity2			1
for years , @entity5 profited greatly from its vast oil reserves			2
one of @entity2 's first orders of business after taking over was to assume control of properties and other interests of international petroleum companies			1
still , even the great wealth of oil could n't change the fact that @entity5 has suffered in the recent global economic downturn			0
as in much of the @entity59 world , youth unemployment is high in @entity5 -- and most of the population has never known a leader other than @entity2			1
and the fact it began in @entity6 , despite the @entity5 leader 's early history , is not a surprise , said @entity242 , an associate professor at @entity243 and author of " @entity245			1
" he noted that the coastal city has traditionally been seen as somewhat disloyal to @entity2 's regime			2
whether the @entity5 demonstrators can follow the leads of their @entity59 colleagues in @entity47 and @entity56 remains to be seen			0
if they do , they will have to overcome a cult of personality -- much like prevailed in those countries -- without having any fallback as far as political institutions or legislation to build off should they succeed			0
unlike @entity56 , @entity5 has no constitution , established institutions or any kind of mechanisms in place to support a new nation			0
the nation and its leader are one			0
" in @entity5 , " @entity242 said , " there is nothing beyond @entity2 and his close circle			2

@entity2 led a military coup in 1969 that began in @entity6
he now faces his first real popular unrest in 42 years centered in @entity6
@entity2 has been controversial internationally and has become more a statesman lately
his government has restricted communication and freedom , *experts* and critics say
