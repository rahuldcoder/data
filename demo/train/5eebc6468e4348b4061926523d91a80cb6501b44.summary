-- i was living in @entity2 when the statues of @entity4 in neighboring @entity5 came toppling down			1
@entity4 , who had arrogantly had his name inscribed on bricks at the ancient city of @entity9 , did not expect his rule to end so abruptly , so humiliatingly			1
and at the @entity12 , students told me that they expected @entity2 president @entity13 to fall soon , too			1
with 250,000 @entity17 troops amassed in @entity5 in 2003 , @entity15 's @entity14 had contemplated rolling @entity17 tanks into the @entity2 capital			1
the @entity20 was to be reshaped in the image of @entity17 democracy			0
but events in @entity5 , @entity24 , and @entity25 distracted the @entity26 , and the " democratic domino theory " did not come to pass			0
ten years after @entity5 , did the war give birth to the @entity30 ? yes , the @entity31 had indirect connections to the @entity34 uprisings that swept the @entity20 and northern @entity35 in 2011			1
for one , the fall of @entity4 must have psychologically empowered @entity34 opposition activists who saw that a @entity39 dictator and his sons could be removed from power			1
full coverage : the @entity31 , 10 years on but it is a mistake to suggest that @entity34 across the region were directly inspired by the fall of @entity4 -- if that were true , they would have risen a decade ago			1
why wait until 2011 ? the answer is that other , more direct developments led to the ongoing @entity34 revolutions			1
first , in the immediate aftermath of the september 11 , 2001 atrocities , @entity34 governments used the ensuing " war on terror " to quell domestic dissent			1
when opposition @entity56 parties questioned the legitimacy of @entity34 dictators , they were portrayed as @entity60 sympathizers to the @entity61 , and their imprisonment in @entity63 or @entity64 or @entity65 did n't raise international eyebrows			1
the violence of radical @entity68 failed to topple strongmen in @entity70 and @entity2 in the 1960s and 1980s			2
and once again , from 2001 to 2011 , government repression of less radical , nonviolent @entity68 signalled to a younger generation of @entity34 that @entity56 could not overthrow autocratic regimes			2
watch now : @entity5 's phantom @entity75 second , as the " war on terror " unfolded , @entity68 continued to fail in their decades - long pursuit to gain political office , and the widespread corruption and nepotism of regimes in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity70 sunk deeper , @entity17 support for @entity34 dictatorships also came into question			2
then @entity17 secretary of state @entity87 put it best in june 2005 : " for 60 years , my country , the @entity17 , pursued stability at the expense of democracy in this region here in the @entity20 , and we achieved neither			0
" these were not just empty words			0
the @entity17 government identified civil society organizations and financially supported @entity99 through the " democracy promotion " agenda			0
during the @entity15 administration , annual funding for these programs exceeded the total amount spent on such programs in the entire decade to 2001 , according to the 2009 budget report from the @entity108			0
funding for the mostly secular democracy activists was bolstered by the training provided for them in use of social media in mobilizing people			0
the invention and popularity of @entity118 and @entity119 helped young @entity34 bypass communications controlled by their dictators			2
even if this @entity17 - funded training in creating political parties , electioneering , communication and media training only reached a small portion of the population , is it any wonder that @entity130 - speaking , elite , urban @entity34 took to @entity118 and @entity119 to help overthrow dictators ? yes , there were local grievances and the uprisings were homegrown			2
the @entity34 uprisings belong to the @entity34 youth			2
but they were also responding by using modern technology to amplify the mood music of @entity142 belief that @entity34 too could create free societies			2
they were not an exception			0
watch : lingering effects of war on @entity5 why else were @entity34 protesters ' attention focused on the @entity150 @entity14 as they demanded the president call on @entity152 to depart ? as @entity154 pressured the @entity14 to oppose @entity152 , @entity153 pressured @entity150 to support @entity152 -- and in that way the uprisings revolved to some degree around the messages sent from the @entity17 government			2
the @entity30 was going to happen with or without @entity4 , but it would not have happened had it not been for the attacks of september 11			1
in fact , in many ways the @entity31 has prevented more from being done to aid the uprisings , hindering global resolve in attending to the killing fields of the full - blown civil war in @entity2			1
opinion : media 's failure on @entity5 still stings it is the ghost of @entity5 that prevents the @entity17 from leading attempts to topple the brutal @entity13 regime in @entity173			0
regime change has consequences , as we learned in @entity5			0
there will be no new commitments to " nation build " again , or re-train police and security forces in a far off @entity34 land			0
the sectarianism , tribalism , @entity185 , border skirmishes and threat of chemical weapons use in @entity2 reminds @entity17 policymakers of the @entity17 and @entity34 blood and treasure sacrificed in @entity5			1
and to what avail ? the ongoing loss of life in @entity2 is a direct result of @entity17 foreign policy blunders in @entity5			1
@entity2 are the victims of @entity17 's @entity5 adventure			0
so as we ponder the last decade and current @entity34 uprisings , let us not gloat about the " success " of @entity5			0
@entity5 is not a success			0
it is now an ally of @entity204 , home to a prime minister who persecutes his own political opposition , and unashamedly supports the @entity13 regime in @entity2			1
@entity70 , @entity209 , @entity85 , and @entity84 were not inspired by @entity17 in @entity5			0
the opinions expressed in this opinion piece are solely those of @entity212 .			0

@entity212 : fall of @entity4 *pyschologically* empowered @entity34 opposition
other , more direct developments had greater effect on @entity30
@entity31 has prevented more from being done to aid @entity30 , especially in @entity2
