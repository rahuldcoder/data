-- if @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 have been the traditional compass points of world fashion , @entity1 has typically not even figured on the map			1
but according to @entity10 , organizer of the @entity11 held in @entity13 's largest city last week , that is unlikely to be the case for much longer			1
she said the event , which drew 77 designers and big names including supermodel @entity18 , @entity20 couturier @entity19 and up - and - coming model @entity21 , had gone a long way to establishing @entity1 as @entity25 's fashion capital , a city with international style credentials			1
" it 's raised the bar , " said @entity10 , international managing director for arise , a title which describes itself as @entity25 's global style and culture magazine			0
" everyone knows it 's @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 -- and we see this as the fifth destination now			2
we 're hoping to make @entity1 a fashion destination , part of the fashion season			1
" why @entity1 ? " it 's the vibrancy , the colors			2
we feel it 's @entity25 's capital , " said @entity10			0
" @entity1 women in particular , they dress like no other			2
they look the part , they get fashion			2
where else would you host such an event ? " while last year 's inaugural event had a heavy @entity13 focus , this year 's fashion week drew designers from across the continent and further afield			1
the runways , housed in massive tents on the grounds of the @entity64 , showcased designs from @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity25 , @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 -- but also from @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
eleven @entity78 - @entity77 designers attended , along with international media and buyers , demonstrating the growing power of the @entity78 fashion brand , said @entity10			1
" you would n't have got them coming from as far away as @entity77 if there was n't a buzz around this event			0
" watch : traditional dress of @entity88 @entity13 - based @entity90 designer @entity89 exhibited her label @entity92 at the event for the first time , using non-professional models scouted from @entity13 's streets			1
she said she relished the chance for her " ethical fashion " label , which she describes as a @entity13 - @entity90 brand , to share a platform with accomplished designers such as @entity25 's @entity102 -- jointly named alongside @entity13 's @entity103 as " designer of the year " at the event			1
" it 's an amazing opportunity to learn , to challenge yourself , to network , " she said			0
" it 's not easy to do things down here			0
" the most noticeable commonality among @entity78 designers was that they were " very proud of being @entity78 , " she said			1
" @entity113 is a way to bring a message of positivity			0
people usually look at @entity25 in a skeptical way , a place that needs to be helped			0
but fashion creates a vehicle to showcase @entity25 in a different way			2
" @entity10 said that while many designers derived inspiration from the heritage of @entity78 textile traditions , no prevailing theme united the collections			1
this was a sign that @entity78 fashion had " come of age , " she said			1
" no one designer produced the same look as another , which really showcases the vastness of the continent			2
people were surprised the collections were so varied			0
" the event had its share of setbacks , with the first two days canceled due to electricity shortages			0
but momentum was quickly recovered , with more than 1500 people trying to crowd into the tent on the last day			0
" the audiences were enthralled by it -- the silks , the golds , the sheer size of the event , " said @entity10			0
away from the fashion , the presence of young @entity20 model @entity21 -- hot property following his appearance in a @entity158 music video , and named " male model of the year " at the event 's awards -- caused the biggest stir			1
" the audiences went berserk , there 's no other way of describing it , " said @entity10			0
" that was the biggest buzz behind the scenes -- he could n't even leave the hotel			0

@entity11 held in @entity1 , @entity13
it aims to showcase @entity78 fashion to the world -- but also has designers from further afield
big names in attendance this year included designer @entity19 and model @entity18
