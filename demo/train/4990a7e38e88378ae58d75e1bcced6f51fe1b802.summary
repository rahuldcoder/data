i am not an expert on @entity3 's syndrome			1
but i am an expert on me , and i have @entity3 's			1
and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder			1
and a bit of obsessive - compulsive disorder			1
having all three disorders together is not unusual , my doctor says			1
like you , i get angry sometimes			1
and , like you , i would never think of channeling that emotion into violence			1
there is no direct connection between violence and autism			1
i do n't break things			1
i do n't hit my dogs			1
i keep a small @entity22 container in the house to catch insects so i can transport them safely outside before my cats or wife see them			2
i do n't disparage hunters , but i could never kill another creature			2
i just do n't have it in me			2
thoughts on @entity32 shooting from a man with @entity3 's for the most part , i am just like you , just a bit quirky			1
all right , a lot quirky			2
i usually have no expression on my face or in my speech			2
i can not look you in the eye			2
( i 've learned to look people in the mouth or nose			2
) i can not have a conversation of more than a few words with you , but i can lecture you ad nauseam on @entity50 atomic bomb tests , the @entity51 , beagles , @entity53 society			1
when you speak to me and i look away intently , i am parsing your words and running through scenarios based on your request or statement in an effort to understand you			2
because i still have a deathly fear of offending someone or talking about something way off - topic , i often hold my hand over my mouth in meetings to keep from speaking			2
being called on to speak is sheer terror			2
and those are just some of my oddities			2
your child / partner / co-worker with @entity3 's has some similar peculiarities			1
that 's why kids with @entity3 's get bullied			1
i did n't get bullied in school because i was n't diagnosed and therefore not labeled			1
i was n't diagnosed until i was 50			2
and when the doctors asked what course of action i wanted , i said none			0
i had made it that far , so i 'd like to continue working it out on my own			0
in fact , until today , most of my co-workers and friends did n't know i had @entity3 's			1
so " aspies " can grow up to have families and be productive and contributing members of society			1
i can not say this will get you through life , and some of my advice may be wrong for you			0
but here 's what helped me : find a " mentor			1
" targeting someone to pattern my social behavior after changed my life			0
he was a co-worker and friend who was outgoing , popular and genuinely nice			0
i mimicked him for years to learn how to approach people and how to act appropriately			0
i 'm not there yet , but i 'm not an outcast			0
i do n't think he ever knew			0
yes , i know you 're uncoordinated , but you can teach yourself coordination			0
i spent years throwing a ball against the garage , developing a throwing motion , building the ability to catch a ball and , eventually , hitting that ball			0
by the fifth grade , i was playing third base in schoolyard pickup games -- and i was no longer picked last			0
my self - esteem skyrocketed , and the tough kids accepted me			1
take all those thoughts in your head and put them down on paper or a computer screen			0
reread them a day , a week , a year later			0
show them to someone you trust			0
i 'll bet he or she thinks a lot of the same things			0
accept your peculiarities and take advantage of those you can : the ability to focus , above - average intelligence			1
be brave ; get out there a bit			0
take your obsessive gardening hobby and use it to socialize by checking out a gardening club or volunteer to help spruce up the neighborhood			0
learn a bit of self - control , but go ahead and make mistakes			0
apologize and have a laugh			0
" @entity151 " people can be quite forgiving , given the chance			0
bullies are more socially flawed than you are			0
if you 're a parent of a child with @entity3 's , let your child experiment			1
that 's how we all learn			1
he or she is likely quite intelligent			0
let your child know you 're pleased when he or she has spoken up to say " yes , please " or " thank you " when the situation called for it			0
we can be quite trying , so please be patient			0
troubling legacy of @entity32 may be backlash against kids with autism			1

there is no direct connection between autism and violence , man with @entity3 's says
kids with autism or @entity3 's are sometimes bullied because of their peculiarities
those with @entity3 's can have families , be productive members of society
