-- the true test of patience is peering for hours into a microscope waiting for a rotifer to open its mouth so you can snap a quick photo			1
that 's exactly what @entity9 did to win this year 's @entity12 competition , an annual event , now in its 40th year , which applauds the artistic merit and skill in microscopic images			1
for those who do n't know , rotifers are tiny aquatic animals typically 200 to 500 micrometers long , that 's less than half a millimeter , at best			0
they 're found in fresh water and moist soil , where they linger in raindrops feeding on phytoplankton and algae filtered through the crown of cilia -- which is also called a corona -- around their mouths			0
" i have always wanted to capture an image where the rotifer show the complete corona in focus , so when i saw the heart - shaped corona i had a feeling it would be a very special picture , " @entity9 told @entity0			2
@entity9 started taking microscopic images in his spare time just five years ago			1
he 's self - taught and , by day , works as a computer system programmer			2
@entity9 has won a place every year since he started entering the competition three years ago			2
" to take this image , i used a flash to freeze the movement of the rotifer and differential interference contrast ( @entity50 ) to show the beautiful details and the blue background , " he said			0
the photo was deemed the most striking and skillful of more than 1,200 entries from 79 countries			1
the top five images this year zoomed in on a calcite crystal , jumping spider eyes , a caterpillar proleg and cells of a bovine pulmonary artery -- proving that beauty can be found just about anywhere			0
