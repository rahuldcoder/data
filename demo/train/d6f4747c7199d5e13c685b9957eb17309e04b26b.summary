-- @entity2 's life and livelihood vanished in a matter of seconds			2
when a fumigation plane flew over his farm in september 2010 , mistakenly targeting his crops with coca eradication chemicals , his small cacao , yucca and plantain plants did n't stand a chance			2
@entity15 and crisp , they can no longer produce food			0
@entity19 , his four children and his pregnant wife , @entity18 , fled to a city slum more than eight hours away and prayed they would be able to return to lush green land someday			0
they are among @entity23 's more than 3 million desplazados , or displaced population			1
the founders of @entity25 , a nonprofit organization trying to turn an international spotlight on the plight of displaced farmers in @entity23 , want to make sure @entity19 's voice is heard			1
" we 're an organization that believes in story telling as a means to bridge the gap between the @entity38 and the developing world , " give us names co-director and editor @entity33 said			2
headquartered in @entity40 , give @entity41 released its first documentary , " leaving @entity43 , " in september			1
it tells @entity19 's story in an effort to end displacement in @entity23 caused by illicit crop fumigations			1
these aerial fumigations are heavily funded as a part of @entity23 , a complex $ 7.5 billion program started in 1999 during the @entity53 administration			1
@entity23 supports the nation 's efforts against the drug trade by investing in various military and anti-drug operations			1
" the aerial eradication program run by the government of @entity23 has been extraordinarily successful , " said @entity59 , director of the @entity60 at the @entity61 in @entity62			1
he said coca cultivation in the @entity67 country has decreased about 40 % and cocaine production has dropped 60 % since @entity23 's inception			1

displacement in @entity23 is extraordinarily complex , @entity59 explained			1
he lists poverty , floods , land titling issues , violence over land , coca cultivation , and terrorism as a result of drug trafficking and child recruitment among the main drivers forcing people from their homes			0
" when you take displacement out of the rather scientific and sterile ways we tend to talk about it , what you 're really talking about is human beings that are being pulled away from their trades , " @entity33 said			2
" things they know how to do , things that give them value ... and that is a deeply human and tragic issue of dignity			0
" according to a 2010 @entity102 report , @entity23 has the world 's highest rate of internal displacement			1
" we kept researching the top humanitarian crises in the world , and @entity23 kept coming up again and again on the top of that list , " documentary co-director @entity106 explained			1
give @entity41 spent months traveling , researching and filming in @entity23			1
" we knew we wanted to get specific , to find a story to tell			0
we had searched for someone who would open their lives to us and tell us about the issue of displacement			2
" give @entity41 met @entity19 through a partner organization several months before his legal crops were fumigated			1
their relationship helped narrow the organization 's focus to displacement caused by fumigation			1
the documentary reports that @entity19 's neighbor 's coca crop — plants whose leaves are processed to make cocaine — remained untouched by the herbicide			1
" if your neighbor is growing coca , every attempt possible is made only to spray the coca itself , " @entity59 said			0
" there is some drift that happens			0
it 's very minimal , within 150 meters			2
" @entity59 added that a complete system in place in @entity23 allows people to file formal complaints through their municipal government			1
if the claims are verified by vigorous review , the farmers get economic redress for any legal crops that have been damaged by the spray program			1
story said few of these receive compensation for a variety of reasons , such as late filing , mixed legal and illegal crops , or lack of evidence of spray			2
according to documents from the anti-narcotics division of @entity23 's @entity166 , in 2004 , only one complaint out of 874 received payment			1
in 2009 , 4,442 complaints were filed			0
redress was paid to 107 of those			0
there are few statistics detailing what percentage of displacement is caused by fumigations			1
@entity177 , a @entity179 human rights nonprofit organization , estimates that 60 % to 70 % of displaced people from the @entity181 in 2007 and 2008 were linked to erroneous fumigations			1
" trying to get at the exact number of people who 've been displaced because of spray event is very difficult , " @entity59 said			2
he placed a loose estimate at less than one - quarter of 1 %			0
out of the nearly 3.5 million desplazados , that 's fewer than 9,000 people			2
@entity59 also said @entity191 has invested $ 2.5 million in areas like @entity43 , where it works with 5,000 displaced people			2
" certainly , our program has spent over $ 1.2 million focused on providing economic redress for those people who 've been affected wrongly by the spray program , " he said			0
" it 's a very rare and unfortunate thing that happens			0
each individual case is a tragedy in itself			0
" " @entity204 " also explores alternative solutions			0
give us names partners with other organizations to place displaced farmers in co-operative - style communities			1
" we want something better for @entity2 , " @entity106 said			0
" and because we want something better for @entity2 , we 're gon na work to make sure it happens			0
so we 're storytellers , but we 're characters within that story at the same time			0
" give @entity41 insists it is n't criticizing the @entity179 government			2
" we 're not attacking them at all , " @entity106 said			0
" we 're saying on our side as @entity38 citizens , we see that our policy 's not going the way it should be			0
so let 's talk with the @entity179 government , the @entity38 government , with different ngos on the ground , and see what are the best ways to move forward			0
" @entity226 , the government entity that assists displaced people , said it does not consider these types of displaced farmers among its statistics			1
