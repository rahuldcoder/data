-- when confronted by gruesome images of a man being beheaded by terrorists , what should you do ? news organizations have grappled with these kinds of questions for decades			1
now , with the prevalence of social media , website operators and ordinary internet users face the same question			1
on tuesday , when @entity16 published a video showing the murder of @entity20 journalist @entity19 , most @entity15 news outlets shunned the goriest portion of the video but chose to show still photos from the minutes before the beheading			1
some commenters urged news outlets to exercise even more restraint and refrain from using the photos at all			1
that same dynamic played out on @entity30 and @entity31 , as well			0
as some users shared photos and links to the video , others exhorted them to share earlier photos of @entity19 's life and links to examples of his reporting instead			1
it was almost as if users were collectively developing their own sets of standards			1
@entity46 , a cousin of the slain journalist , wrote on @entity30 , " do n't watch the video			2
that 's not how life should be			2
" but there 's a big difference between individual user decisions and institutional decisions by @entity30 and @entity56			2
for the web sites , blocking objectionable content is a form of editing			0
@entity56 removes video the slickly - produced , high - definition video was originally uploaded to @entity56 , but was taken off the site within a matter of hours			2
@entity56 also sought to take down duplicates whenever they were posted			0
a @entity56 representative said the site , owned by @entity68 , has " clear policies that prohibit content like gratuitous violence , hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts , and we remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users			1
" " we also terminate any account registered by a member of a designated @entity81 and used in an official capacity to further its interests , " the representative added			0
videos of @entity16 executions are still accessible through other sites , however			2
one such site , @entity88 , said wednesday that it was " currently experiencing an abnormally high volume of traffic			0
" @entity30 suspends accounts @entity30 faced similar issues -- and a tremendous amount of pressure from its users about the balancing act between freedom of expression and basic human decency			2
" we have been and are actively suspending accounts as we discover them related to this graphic imagery , " @entity30 chief executive @entity100 wrote in an early wednesday morning post on the site			0
it all amounted to a particularly grotesque version of whack - a - mole			0
at one point tuesday evening , simply tweeting the word " beheading " resulted in replies from spam accounts that attached a photo of @entity19 's severed head			1
@entity30 briefly suspended the account of a journalist who shared photos of the beheading , but reinstated it later			2
propaganda value of images @entity0 is not airing the video on television or online , but is showing stills from the minutes before the beheading and an audio clip from it			1
" it 's news that the executioner 's accent may offer a hint about his identity , " @entity127 anchor @entity126 said in a television segment that explained the network 's decision - making			0
" it 's news that may change what governments and armies do next			0
it 's news that other journalists will spread ... and that social media will spread without any journalists involved , no matter what we do			1
it 's news that extremists wanted us all to spread ... and they killed a man , at least in part , so that we 'd do it			0
" @entity126 added , " what should we do ? we thought about it , and we hope we made the right choice			0
" the tabloid @entity157 newspaper decided to go further , publishing on its front page a frame from the video that shows a terrorist beginning to cut into @entity19 's head			1
the newspaper headline says " savages			0
" some internet users subsequently suggested that the @entity157 's @entity30 account should be suspended , too			1
the horrific case revived long - running debates about whether news coverage of a terrorist act gives the terrorists the publicity they seek			0
many internet users ' arguments against showing even still images from the @entity19 video cited the propaganda value of the video			1
one of the counter arguments is that people should see -- must see -- the atrocities			0
some of the same debates took place in 2002 , after @entity185 extremists beheaded the @entity187 reporter @entity186 and published the video on the @entity189			0
@entity190 , who was the head of corporate communications for the @entity187 at the time , said he had to " urge the networks not to run the video			0
" in @entity19 's case , he said , " it 's good to see that the networks are acting so responsibly in this case by refusing to show this barbaric action			1
" @entity30 removes images of beheading beheading of @entity20 journalist @entity19 recalls past horrors @entity0 's @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			1

images and videos of @entity19 's beheading are on the internet
many media outlets , *including* @entity0 , are not showing the video
internet users and operators must decide how to deal with the video
