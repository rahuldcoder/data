-- " @entity2 " musical ? eh , we 've seen that before			1
but a " @entity2 " opera ? now that 's something we did n't expect			2
@entity8 's artistic director and conductor @entity7 has confirmed that he 's working on composing " @entity2 â € ” @entity10 , " a mini-opera based on both the show itself and the @entity15 's sonnet ( titled " @entity16 " )			1
philly newswoman ' breaks bad ' with ill - conceived tweet although specifics are yet to be released , @entity7 wrote a blog explaining that the mini-opera hopes to " explore the question that the drama obsessively and hauntingly asked : ' are we all breaking bad ? ' " " @entity16 " will run through @entity25 on january 26 - 27 , 2014			1
so what suggestions do you all have for @entity7 ? we 're thinking @entity29 needs his own dance number , and @entity31 should sing his latest " @entity33 " pitch			0
@entity35 newspaper runs @entity37 's official obituary and obviously , @entity38 gets a solo about sitting alone in a hotel room with nothing but his thoughts for , like , ever			0
or maybe we 're on the wrong track			0
bottom line : would you go see a " @entity2 " mini-opera ? see the original story at @entity0			2
