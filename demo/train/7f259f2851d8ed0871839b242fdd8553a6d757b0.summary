-- @entity2 photographer @entity1 knew virtually nothing of @entity4 when he followed his girlfriend , a humanitarian worker , to the @entity7 capital			1
" i was not even able to put @entity4 or @entity8 on a map			1
so , like everybody , i started to @entity11 it , " he confesses			1
the search results did not paint a pretty picture of the country : images that popped up were mainly of civil war , blood diamonds , and child soldiers			2
" it looks like a nightmare , like hell on earth			2
it 's a very bad marketing job , " says @entity1			2
when he arrived , he admits he was " not scared , but worried , " though he soon found the city was a much friendlier place than @entity11 let on			1
" i quickly realized it 's really rather nice , " he says			2
" it 's one of the safest countries in @entity30			2
there 's a big discrepancy between what is really the country and its image internationally			0
" addressing this disparity , @entity36 launched @entity38 , a series of @entity40 that aims to capture the city 's lighter side			0
though the settings in some of these looped animations show the scars of @entity8 's civil war ( the once five - star @entity48 , which today stands empty , is a regular backdrop ) , @entity36 's films also feature smiling , upbeat locals			1
" i do n't always have a plan			0
a lot of the time , i go around the city and meet people			0
it 's just about having fun and creating some magic , " he says			0
though many of the city 's residents recognize him now , he admits that finding subjects had its challenges in the beginning , particularly because most assumed he was a foreign reporter looking to exploit their image			0
" the moment they see you have a camera , they think you 're a journalist and will bring the photo back to @entity74 to make money from it , " he says			0
to put his subjects at ease , @entity36 made a point of returning with the @entity40 on a smartphone , both to prove that the image would stay in @entity8 , and to demonstrate his concept			1
" they do n't always understand that day why i want them to run , but if they do n't get it on the spot , they get it a few days later when i come back with the phone			0
" the digital format also appeals to @entity36 , partly because he finds @entity30 is underrepresented , both as a theme in digital art , and as a source of it			0
for @entity36 , an important aspect of the project is showing that @entity8 is capable of creating powerful , thought - provoking digital works			1
since moving to @entity4 , the local culture has inspired a number of other projects , too , including collages made from @entity101 posters and sculptures made from decommissioned @entity103 from the country 's civil war			1
mainly , though , @entity36 wants to update the version of @entity8 currently making the rounds on the internet			1
" honestly , the goal of this is that maybe in a few months , or a few years , when people stop to @entity8 or @entity4 , they will find my gifs , instead of images of child soldiers , " he says			1
" maybe it 's a little bit ambitious , but that 's the target			0
