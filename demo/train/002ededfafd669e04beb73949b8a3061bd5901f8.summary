if you want to know where @entity2 food traditions are headed , look back			0
many of today 's most healthful eating trends bear a strong resemblance to yesterday 's : nearby farms offering nutritious , peak - of - season produce ; slow - cooked dinners that foster leisurely family meals ; an emphasis on meatless dishes and minimally processed foods			1
sales of organic food have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , the @entity14 says			2
" it used to be that packaging and convenience were all the rage			0
but today , food lovers also want to know where their food comes from and how to prepare it in the simplest , most natural way possible , " says @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , a community nutritionist based in @entity24			2
" people still want and need to save time in the kitchen , but they 're not willing to sacrifice taste and nutrition to get it			0
" fortunately , these five food trends provide exactly that -- flavorful , nutrient - rich meals that are easy to prepare and can help you fulfill many of your dietary requirements			1
@entity39 like vegetarians , " flexitarians " eat a primarily plant - based diet composed of grains , vegetables , and fruits , but they occasionally obtain protein from lean meat , fish , poultry , or dairy			1
a quarter of @entity2 fit the description , consuming meatless meals at least four days a week , according to the @entity54			0
why it 's here to stay : @entity39 is exactly what dietitians , nutritional researchers , and public health advocates have been recommending for years			1
" it 's about eating a varied diet that 's low in saturated fat and high in fiber , " says @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity23 , chief dietitian at @entity63 in @entity24 , and an @entity54 spokesperson			2
because the emphasis is on produce rather than protein , flexitarians are more likely than most @entity2 to meet the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables and the vitamins and minerals they contain			1
@entity79 : take our quiz on correct serving sizes what it means for you : studies show that people who follow this approach to eating generally weigh less and have lower rates of hypertension , heart disease , diabetes , and prostate and colon cancer			2
in one large study from @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99 , researchers tracked the eating habits of more than 9,600 people over a 19 - year period and found those who consumed fruits and vegetables at least three times daily lowered their risk of stroke by 42 percent , and their risk of cardiovascular disease by 27 percent			0
locally grown foods as people seek fresher foods , they have begun to connect with local family farms			1
community - supported agriculture ( @entity116 ) programs and farmers ' markets give consumers direct access to produce , meats , cheeses , breads , honey , and other foods that are produced in nearby communities			1
in the past 10 years , the number of local farmers ' markets has more than doubled -- it is up from 1,755 to 3,706 , according to the @entity2 @entity14 's @entity131			1
why it 's here to stay : because they are so fresh , locally grown fruits and vegetables often have a nutritional edge over produce raised on " factory " farms			1
the latter , which constitutes most of the produce grown in the @entity2 , is picked about four to seven days before it arrives on supermarket shelves , and shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before it 's sold , according to @entity144 , a nonprofit agricultural research group			1
all that downtime takes a toll			0
@entity14 researchers have found that if it 's not handled properly , produce can lose up to half its nutrients in transit			1
water - soluble nutrients such as vitamin c are particularly vulnerable			1
what it means for you : " buying food from local vendors gives you input , " says @entity156 , @entity23 , food systems analyst at the @entity158			0
" you can find out how things were grown			0
you can also request varieties of fruits and vegetables that would n't be available elsewhere			0
" and then there 's the most important reason of all : because of its freshness , locally grown food tastes better than produce designed to be shipped			1
" growers ' priority is on taste and texture versus transportation , " @entity156 says			0
functional foods functional foods are enriched with nutrients that may not be inherent to a given food			1
familiar examples include orange juice fortified with calcium or milk fortified with vitamins a and @entity189 as sales of these foods have soared in recent years , more functional foods have reached the market , such as eggs and pastas with omega - 3 fatty acids , sterol - fortified chocolates and high - fiber , high - protein flours			1
why it 's here to stay : these foods help many people fill nutritional gaps			1
" for example , if you 're lactose intolerant , you might find it difficult to meet your calcium quota , " @entity60 says			0
" calcium - fortified juice eliminates that problem , especially if a glass is already part of your daily diet			1
" likewise , if you dislike seafood , you can obtain extra omega - 3s from eggs or pasta			2
@entity79 : remembering real portion sizes what it means for you : functional foods are one helpful element in maintaining a balanced diet , not a substitute for it			1
" calcium - fortified orange juice wo n't supply other nutrients that a dairy source would provide , like protein , " @entity21 says			1
" that 's why it 's best to rely on whole foods , which provide multiple nutrients that act synergistically			2
" in the end , it 's fine to reap added nutrients from a functional food , but remember to fulfill the majority of your needs with naturally rich sources			2
organic food these are foods produced following a government - regulated practice of growing and processing that minimizes exposure to pesticides , herbicides , and other chemicals used in traditional farming			1
organic food is one of the country 's fastest - growing market segments ; sales have risen more than 20 percent per year since the 1990s , according to the @entity14 's @entity255			2
why it 's here to stay : some organic foods may provide a nutrition boost			2
a research review of 41 studies conducted by the @entity158 found that , on average , organic produce contains as much as 27 percent more vitamin c , 21 percent more iron , and 29 percent more magnesium compared with traditionally grown foods			1
the kinds of packaged organic foods that now fuel the category 's growth , such as cookies , baked goods , and boxed meals , also benefit from a similar perception of healthfulness			2
what it means for you : " an organic stamp is n't necessarily a guarantee of nutritional quality , but it is a sure sign that the food is less adulterated , " @entity60 says			0
an organic cookie , for example , may have just as many calories and grams of saturated fat as a nonorganic cookie			0
but in the case of produce crops that are commonly treated with high concentrations of pesticides , such as peaches , apples , and strawberries , choosing organic can minimize your exposure to these chemicals , according to tests conducted by researchers from the @entity298 in @entity299 : all - star foods that fight for health slow food launched in @entity303 20 years ago by restaurateur @entity304 , " slow food " was originally designed to protest the encroachment of fast food on the traditional @entity308 lifestyle			1
the trend 's principles -- choosing locally grown and produced items , preparing them in traditional ways , and eating with friends and family -- celebrate a relaxed approach to living that provides a welcome contrast to the fast - paced , eat - on - the - run lives many people lead			1
why it 's here to stay : as with locally grown food , freshness is a key component of the slow food trend			0
" investing the time to choose what 's fresh that day will ensure that night 's meal will be at its peak nutritionally , " @entity60 says			0
this principle applies whether you 're making a family recipe or dining in a restaurant where the chef selects ingredients based on their seasonal availability			0
family togetherness is also an important aspect of the trend			0
" slow food is all about cherishing the eating experience and getting back to what food used to be : a vehicle for drawing people together , " explains @entity341 , assistant director of @entity342			0
what it means for you : healthful whole foods are a great start , but slow food goes a step beyond good nutrition -- and it 's a difficult one to quantify			0
no scientific studies have conclusively proven that friends and family make better dinner companions than televisions , but the benefits are clear			0
" slow food embraces the psychological component in food choices , meal preparation , and the act of eating , " @entity21 says			0
" a healthful diet is n't just about what you eat but how you eat it			2
