@entity0 -- on one side were pegboard panels mounted with various assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons -- including a bushmaster similar to the one used in last month 's @entity8 school massacre			1
behind the stage stood police officers supporting a renewed ban on such firepower			0
one by one , victims of gun violence told their brief stories and expressed support for a new federal ban being proposed by sen. @entity18 on some assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons			1
almost six weeks after the @entity22 shooting rampage that killed 20 first graders , @entity18 said she planned to introduce her measure later thursday , with @entity25			1
@entity26 of @entity27 and @entity28 of @entity29 doing the same in the @entity31			0
what 's in @entity18 's gun bill ? @entity18 's proposal would upgrade an assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and also outlaw ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds			1
she said the goal is to " dry up the supply of these weapons over time			0
" " these massacres do n't seem to stop , " the @entity42 @entity41 lamented , listing notorious rampages of past years known by the lone name of their locations -- @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			2
" we should be outraged at how easy it is " for attackers to get hold of the semi-automatic weapons or large - capacity magazines used in those slaughters , @entity18 told the event at the @entity54 that she organized			2
@entity8 probe to extend until summer her legislation is opposed by the nation 's powerful gun lobby , led by the @entity66			1
that means that despite a push by the @entity31 and @entity70 for tougher gun control steps , @entity18 's full measure is given little chance of winning congressional approval			1
in a statement on thursday , the @entity66 said that @entity18 " has been trying to ban guns from law - abiding citizens for decades			1
" " the @entity80 people know gun bans do not work and we are confident @entity82 will reject senator @entity18 's wrong - headed approach , " the organization added			1
in a sign of the gun lobby 's influence , a nine - day sports and outdoor show scheduled to take place in @entity87 next month was postponed thursday because the @entity66 withdrew its support over the decision by organizers to ban the display of " modern sporting rifles " -- the kind of semi-automatic weapons targeted by @entity18 's proposal			1
at her @entity0 event , @entity18 acknowledged that enacting a ban was " really an uphill road , " adding : " if anyone asks if we can win this , the answer is we do n't know , because it 's really uphill			1
" she then made a plea for people to call their senators and @entity31 members to declare " enough is enough , " adding that a mobilized public is " stronger than the gun lobby			2
" later thursday , vice president @entity112 made a similar appeal in an online discussion on @entity115 , saying : " make your voices heard			1
" he insisted that a reasonable ban on semi-automatic weapons and high - capacity magazines , as well as strengthening background checks , presented no threat to the constitutional right to bear arms			0
" it 's not about keeping bad guns out of the hands of good people , " @entity112 said			1
" it 's about keeping all guns out of the hands of bad people			2
" president @entity132 called for renewing the assault weapons ban as part of his package of gun control proposals announced earlier this month in response to the december 14 @entity8 school massacre and overall gun violence in @entity80			1
marine to senator : ' no ma'am , ' i wo n't register my guns @entity18 's measure would stop the sale , transfer , importation and manufacture of more than 100 specialty firearms and certain semi-automatic rifles , as well as limiting magazines to 10 rounds or less , she said			1
not all of the weapons in the bill meet the technical definition of assault weapons			0
the restrictions would not apply to guns owned before enactment of any law			0
@entity18 noted her proposal exempts from the ban more than 2,000 models used for hunting or sporting purposes			1
" they are by make and model exempted from the legislation , " she said , adding that the old ban had 375 such exemptions			0
those exemptions were an apparent effort to garner support for the measure from conservative democrats and others expected to face fierce lobbying by the @entity66 and constituents			1
supporters of more gun control acknowledge the constitutional right to bear arms , but argue that rifles capable of firing multiple rounds automatically or semi-automatically exceed the reasonable needs of hunters and other gun enthusiasts			2
they also contend that high - capacity ammunition magazines provide the capability for mass shootings such as the @entity8 massacre			2
opponents contend the @entity196 forbids the government from this type of limit on weapon ownership by citizens			0
they worry that such a weakening of gun rights would signal a shift that would leave citizens defenseless against criminals and , some also argue , against potential future government tyranny or abuse			0
instead , the @entity66 has called for increasing armed guards at schools to protect students			2
speakers at the event organized by @entity18 rejected arguments that anyone beyond the military or law enforcement officers needed such firepower			2
" how are you going to hunting with something like that ? " asked @entity220 police commissioner @entity219 , pointing to the assault weapons displayed to his left			0
" you kill something , there 's nothing left to eat			0
" with new @entity82 comes a new push for gun laws continuing bloodshed on the nation 's streets -- with dozens dying every day from gun violence -- should be enough evidence to overcome the past inability to get gun control legislation enacted , he argued			1
" if the slaughter of 20 babies does not capture and hold your attention , then i give up because i do n't know what else will , " @entity219 continued , thrusting a pointed finger for emphasis			0
at @entity18 's request , people who were injured or lost loved ones to gun violence , including several from the @entity49 massacre , then offered their support for her efforts			1
some told of losing a parent or child			0
others described how attackers inflicted carnage so quickly			0
@entity257 , a staff member to rep. @entity258 of @entity259 , said she was a few feet away from the congresswoman on the day both were shot outside a @entity51 grocery store			0
" on that day , 30 bullets were delivered in less than 30 seconds , " @entity263 said			0
@entity66 chief : @entity132 makes ' mockery ' of @entity80 freedoms some of the weapons on display thursday are currently against the law in the @entity0 , and @entity70 sources told @entity1 that @entity18 coordinated with police on being able to have the guns there			1
@entity276 's @entity275 was recently investigated for holding a banned ammunition magazine on the network 's " @entity280 " program broadcast from @entity0			0
no charges were brought in that case			0
@entity132 's proposals include expanding and strengthening background checks on gun buyers to ensure all sales include screening to prevent weapons from going to criminals and the mentally ill. while the gun lobby has indicated support for some improvements in background checks , it remains opposed to other steps , saying they wo n't prevent criminals from getting weapons			1
instead , gun advocates urge tougher enforcement of existing laws and making criminals serve their full sentences			0
@entity112 led a panel assembled by @entity132 in december to examine gun control steps after the @entity8 shootings , which sparked a fierce public debate over how to prevent such mass killings			1
@entity112 's recommendations formed the basis of the package of proposals @entity132 announced this month			1
a recent @entity1 / @entity314 / @entity313 poll indicated that @entity80 generally favor stricter gun control , but they do n't believe that stricter gun laws alone would reduce gun violence			1
in announcing his gun control package , @entity132 also signed executive actions that call for tougher enforcement of existing laws and require federal agencies to provide data for background checks			0
@entity323 recently enacted a series of new gun regulations , the nation 's first since the @entity8 shootings			1
ten other states are reviewing some form of related action			0
the issue is among the most politically divisive in the country , as demonstrated by the decision by @entity334 to postpone the nine - day @entity335 and @entity336 scheduled to start february 2 in @entity337			0
on tuesday , the @entity66 withdrew its support for the show due to the decision by organizers to ban modern sporting rifles from exhibition			2
" we had called on @entity334 to reconsider their decision ; unfortunately they have steadfastly refused to do so , " an @entity66 statement said			2
" as a result , the @entity66 will not be participating in the upcoming show in @entity337 or in any other shows hosted by @entity334 that maintain this policy			2
" in announcing thursday that the show was off , a @entity334 official said the intent of excluding " certain products " was to focus on hunting and fishing traditions of the event			0
" it has become very clear to us after speaking with our customers that the event could not be held because the atmosphere of this year 's show would not be conducive to an event that is designed to provide family enjoyment , " said @entity359 , the company 's president for the @entity361			2
" it is unfortunate that in the current emotionally charged atmosphere this celebratory event has become overshadowed by a decision that directly affected a small percentage of more than 1,000 exhibits showcasing products and services for those interested in hunting and fishing , " he added			0
@entity1 's @entity381 , @entity382 and @entity383 contributed to this report .			0
