@entity2 what kind of microscopic life lurks in the depths of @entity2 's sprawling subway system -- on railings , turnstiles , benches , the ubiquitous closing doors ? a team of @entity2 scientists spent more than a year collecting hundreds of samples of microorganisms			1
some dna samples on subway surfaces matched no known organisms studied before , while others were fragments associated with anthrax and the bubonic plague			1
in some cases , the germs reflected the diversity of the city 's neighborhoods			0
medical students , graduate students and volunteers -- under the direction of senior investigator dr. @entity30 of @entity31 -- had the unenviable task of spending 17 months in the @entity2 underground collecting microorganisms from every subway station along the system 's 24 lines , according to a report published this week			1
there should be a @entity41 category for that ? scientists chose the @entity2 subway system because it is the largest in the world by station count and transports 5.5 million people per day , according to the @entity48			1
" this vast urban ecosystem is a precious resource that requires monitoring to sustain and secure it against acts of bioterrorism , environmental disruptions or disease outbreaks , " according to the report			2
that @entity2 's underground -- or its surface , for that matter -- teems with all manner of repugnant microbes is no surprise to any longtime resident or newcomer to the city			1
but the scientists believe the largest and most dense city in the @entity68 is the ideal setting for some of the first ever large - scale microbe studies , according to the report			1
the goal : to develop new ways to monitor disease outbreaks and guard against bioterrorism threats			0
after sequencing samples were picked up at subway stations , researchers determined that nearly half did " not match any known organism " -- a fact that underscores " the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas , " the report said			1
those that were identifiable were studied , however , with researchers determining the effect those microorganisms could have on the general subway - riding public			1
more than half of the bacteria strands identified were not associated with disease but some 31 % could affect " immune - compromised , injured , or disease - susceptible populations , " the report said			2
the researchers tested culture samples grouped by the subway station in which they found and determined that 28 % represented colonies " resistant to standard antibiotics			1
" one subway station even produced a " multi-drug - resistant culture			2
" " these results indicate , not surprisingly , that there are live bacterial communities present on the subway , but they also show that a substantive proportion of these possess some resistance to commonly used antibiotics , " according to the report			1
even though researchers picked up elements deemed " infectious agents " by the federal @entity118 , such as anthrax and the bubonic plague , subway users are not at risk , the report said			1
even low levels of those elements " will not necessarily confer a risk of acquiring these pathogens			0
" " the subway , in general , is primarily a safe surface , " the report said			1
" although evidence of @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , and other @entity118 infectious agents was found on the subway system in multiple stations , the results do not suggest that the plague or anthrax is prevalent , nor do they suggest that @entity2 residents are at risk			1
" @entity2 health officials called the study " deeply flawed			1
" " the interpretation of the results is misleading , " the @entity143 said in a statement			0
" we do n't know what bacteria they found , but for a number of reasons , we 're convinced that it was n't the plague or anthrax			1
there are other possible explanations for their findings , â€Ž and it is a common and best practice in scientific papers for authors to acknowledge them			0
instead , the @entity161 team simply claimed that they had found these bacteria without acknowledging any scientific uncertainty			0
" phew ! one subway station in particular yielded fascinating results			2
the @entity166 on the no. 1 subway line , which had been closed for a period of time after being completely flooded during @entity170 in 2012 , according to the report			2
in the station on the southernmost tip of @entity175 , scientists picked up species normally associated with the maritime life two years after the flooding			2
the organisms " mirror bacteria that are more commonly associated with fish species , marine environments , or very cold @entity184 environments ; yet these species are still distinct from " others sampled from the @entity187 in @entity188 , which was also studied in this report			2
but it did not take a natural disaster for the microorganism ecosystems of a subway station to vary noticeably from the next station			0
the study found that @entity196 swabbed at certain subway stations paralleled the ethnic demographic of the community that lived around it			2
researchers studied samples that could be analyzed with " ancestry - informative markers " and then compared the results to a map of a demographic community compiled from the 2010 census			0
in one station in a primarily @entity213 / @entity212 area of the @entity214 , for instance , the team identified @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 as the top three ancestries			0
there was also an increase in @entity221 and @entity223 indicators at the subway station that matched an area adjacent to the station , according to census data			0
@entity30 said the report can have broad and lasting implications			0
a dna clue can " represent a ' genetic history ' of that person 's daily or weekly travels , " which may evoke a fear of privacy invasion in some			0
but there is also a potential for new forensic tools and methods to those in the criminal justice field			0
in the immediate future , however , @entity30 and his team believe their study is a " first step " towards protecting the health of @entity2 -- and could be the basis for a " smart city " where leaders use the data to improve city planning as well as management of mass transit and human health			1
and leave the latex gloves at home			0
" it is absolutely not necessary to ride the subway with gloves on , " @entity30 , the senior investigator , told @entity3 affiliate @entity259			0
" when we were taking samples , i saw people with paper towels , gloves with plastic on their hands -- all of it is unnecessary			0

@entity2 health officials say the study is " deeply flawed "
scientists collected samples of hundreds of microorganisms in @entity2 subway
some dna samples were associated with anthrax and bubonic plague , report says
