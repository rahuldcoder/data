-- last week , in his first days at his new job as manager of the @entity5 , @entity2 - born @entity1 said to @entity6 , " i love @entity8 , " adding " you know why ? a lot of people have wanted to kill @entity8 for the last 60 years , but that mother --- --- is still there			1
" the @entity5 ' brand new $ 634 million ballpark is in the city 's @entity14 , and not surprisingly , @entity1 's words ignited a powder keg of emotion and anger from @entity20			1
since then , @entity1 apologized and received his punishment -- suspension from five games			1
and to many , that 's that			0
after all , some say , @entity1 , legendary for inserting his foot in his mouth , was simply mouthing off			2
@entity29 's @entity28 put it this way : " i ca n't believe anyone cares what @entity1 thinks about a foreign dictator			2
baseball should not want to be in a place where it restricts political speech			0
" @entity1 joins a long line of people in powerful positions in sports saying offensive things ; salty - tongued @entity43 , former owner of the @entity44 , went so far as to praise @entity45			2
but to dismiss @entity1 's words as inconsequential , so absurd as to not warrant serious analysis , is to ignore the depth and passion of @entity50 who live in this country not as immigrants but as exiles			1
@entity50 - @entity54 were kicked out of @entity50 by a hateful despot			1
as such , their view of @entity8 is imbued by violent , tragic experience and memory , and by a profound appreciation for the freedoms they now enjoy in the @entity54			1
that a public figure in sports claimed respect -- even love -- for @entity8 is despicable			2
there have been calls for @entity1 's resignation , threats of boycotts of all @entity5 games and constant coverage in @entity72 of the firestorm that appears only to have increased since @entity1 fumbled out an apology , blaming his statement on a miscommunication because of his poor @entity77			1
amid the furor , some major leaguers refrained from any comment , for fear of repercussions in @entity50			0
@entity84 pitcher @entity83 , who defected from @entity50 17 years ago , did n't want to risk expressing an opinion , so strong is his fear of @entity8			1
" i do not talk about politics , " @entity83 said			0
" i still have family down there			0
" @entity91 , a journalist for the @entity92 , explained , " without getting into comparison shopping on atrocities ... for @entity20 , he 's our @entity45			0
" older @entity50 still recount with great pain their memories of @entity8 's infamous " paredons , " or firing squads , to which he summarily subjected thousands of his enemies at the beginning of his revolution			2
as @entity107 's reports document , the terror , torture and repression that @entity50 continue to experience under @entity8 's brutal regime seem boundless			1
activists against the regime are held for days in detention centers subject to " interrogations , intimidation , and threats			0
beatings during detention have also been reported			0
" dr. @entity116 , a renowned @entity50 - @entity54 doctor in @entity72 and ceo of the @entity119 @entity118 , recalled that when he was 5 and living in @entity50 , his father @entity120 , a doctor , became disillusioned with the @entity8 regime and sought permission to emigrate			1
this sole act was considered treason , and he was summarily sent to a forced labor camp indefinitely			0
the @entity50 police took an inventory of the family 's possessions -- thereby taking ownership of them on paper -- and @entity116 and his mom and sister were forced to survive on their own			0
seven years later @entity120 was released			0
in 1973 , when @entity116 was 12 , @entity8 's police conducted another inventory to seize their possessions before letting them leave @entity50			2
@entity116 chokes up remembering how he boarded the plane in a shirt and pants cut out from a sack of potatoes			0
the family arrived in @entity145 , penniless			0
@entity116 eventually made it to @entity72 , where he struggled to learn @entity77 and make something of himself			0
" our experience , " he says now , " was mild compared to millions of other @entity50 - @entity54			1
" @entity1 's insensitive comments and the subsequent explosive reaction from @entity50 - @entity54 have exposed a raw , painful vein in the @entity54 @entity153 experience			1
and such a vein should not be dismissed or ignored			0
when @entity43 spewed her racist comments , she was suspended for two seasons and ultimately forced to sell the @entity44			0
she will be remembered as a bigoted anti-semite			0
in that light , @entity1 's five - game suspension hardly seems just			2
@entity8 is not @entity45 , but @entity91 's claim that @entity8 is " our @entity45 " -- a sentiment echoed by many exiles -- points unavoidably to the fact that the way @entity50 - @entity54 feel about @entity8 is a lot like the way @entity169 feel about @entity45			1
and it also points to the woeful lack of understanding on the part of most @entity54 -- those who would dismiss @entity1 's words and @entity50 exiles ' reaction to them as irrelevant -- about the @entity50 - @entity54 experience , versus the understanding that @entity54 have of the @entity169 experience			1
indeed , if @entity1 had expressed his love and respect for @entity45 instead of @entity8 , his punishment would have been immediate and severe -- and no one would be dismissing his statement as irrelevant			2
@entity1 's words were an insult to all freedom - loving @entity54 , not just @entity20			1
and to those who would say otherwise , i would respond that there needs to be a wake - up call to the tragedy and pain of the @entity50 exile experience			1
such a wake - up call will bring a greater understanding of what it means to be @entity50 - @entity54 and what it means to be @entity54 -- and a much - needed appreciation for the freedoms we often take for granted in this country			1
freedoms that @entity1 's beloved @entity8 ripped so viciously away from his countrymen			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			0

@entity5 manager @entity1 apologized for comments *admiring* @entity8
@entity207 said some dismissed the *controversy* and said suspension was too harsh
he says @entity54 needs a wake - up call about repression , brutality @entity50 exiles suffered
