-- who is @entity2 ? that 's the burning question at the heart of " @entity5 , " the anticipated follow - up to best - selling author @entity7 's 2006 literary debut			1
@entity7 burst onto the scene in 2006 with " @entity9			1
" she received a six - figure advance , almost unheard of for a first - time author , a ton of hype and even some snarky backlash over her photogenic looks			1
but the book lived up to expectations , selling some 200,000 copies and landing on the @entity20 ' list of @entity21 of 2006			1
seven years later , " night film " is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype			1
movie rights are already spoken for by @entity27 , the studio behind " @entity29 " and " @entity30 , " and critics are raving about @entity7 's multimedia storytelling approach , which takes readers beyond the novel 's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed - up reporter out to expose him			1
@entity7 's fictional mash - up of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 has n't been seen in public for 30 years			1
his movies are so frightening no theater will show them ; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings			2
investigative journalist @entity52 tried to expose @entity2 years ago and it backfired , costing him his job , marriage and reputation			1
when @entity2 's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide , @entity52 sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall			1
@entity7 weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles , newspaper headlines , police reports , crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards			1
she also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on @entity71 that offer clues into the book 's mystery , including snippets and trailers from @entity2 's films			1
@entity7 said she wanted to give readers another way to interact with the story , hoping her fans obsess over " @entity5 " just as she did writing it			1
fast facts : @entity7 age : 35 hometown : grew up in @entity85 , @entity86 ; lives in @entity87			1
for fans of : psychological thrillers like @entity91 's critically acclaimed " @entity90 , " and " @entity92 " by @entity93			1
five questions with @entity7 @entity0 : what was the spark behind this book ? @entity7 : it was definitely @entity2 and the idea of this underground , hidden figure			1
i 'd done a lot of research on filmmakers and the idea of an auteur and patriarch who invites people to his estate to make a film , like @entity40 shot his films on a set that had been built on his estate so he did n't have to leave			1
that was a germinating idea for me in terms of @entity117			0
also , the idea of someone hidden , our world is so overexposed right now			0
people do n't get out of bed without tweeting about it			0
people do n't make art these days without begging people to interact with it , to buy it , to consume it in some way			0
i wanted to create the antithesis of all that , a figure who went out of his way to become completely underground , who did n't care about selling any kind of product			2
it was really about a return to mystery in our lives and finding that again in our overexposed world			0
@entity0 : the book has a compulsive , driven feel to it			2
was it that way for you writing it ? @entity7 : the writing process was exactly as obsessive			1
in some ways the writer 's experience with the material ca n't help but drip down onto the pages			2
i would n't call it anxiety because i really did love creating this world , but there were things that kept me awake at night			2
i think that sense of dislocation and claustrophobia and not exactly knowing where i was going , only that i was driven to find out what was there at the very end			0
i had all those same experiences as a writer that my characters did , simply because of the nature of this book			2
i wanted to push myself to the end of my writing experience and then see if i could take myself even further			0
i really wanted to challenge myself			0
@entity0 : tell me why you used a multimedia approach to the story ? @entity7 : i was n't trying to break any boundaries but i wanted to find the best means by which to tell the story			1
i personally love archives and i love going through old antique stores and looking at old wedding photographs , and old class photos of people in kindergarten in the 1920s			0
i love looking at the ephemera people leave behind when they 're no longer here			0
i wanted to bring that feeling to " @entity5 " and through those bits and pieces bring @entity2 's world to life			1
i wanted to make his world really immediate to the reader			0
there 's a voyeuristic quality that i think is really compelling to be able to peruse old reports			2
i definitely went through a lot of old police blogs and read through crime scene reports			0
it 's absolutely fascinating the level of detail that goes into describing things like the blood spatter pattern and the positioning of the body , it 's absolutely fascinating			2
in this csi world , where everyone knows a lot about forensics , it made sense to give that to readers , rather than just telling them about it			0
@entity0 : did the book turn out the way you 'd envisioned ? @entity7 : i think it became even darker and more gnarled			1
i wanted a really dark , mythical odyssey , something really immersive			0
i began writing it around the time of the financial crisis in late 2008 , when it felt like the world was in such a state of chaos			0
every time you turned on the tv there was more bad news and it seemed as if things were really dire			0
in @entity87 people were really down and i know i wanted an escape			0
i wanted something that was thrilling , and enigmatic , that moved , but also multi-layered with great characters			0
i thought more in terms of a mood and a feeling and an experience			0
that was the story i wanted to read and i think as writers we always write what we wish existed			0
so i wanted something dark but i think it 's critical even in those dark places to have lightness			2
even when things were dire , as they were in 2008 , there 's always time for humor , which is why my character @entity262 has so many asides in the book			1
@entity0 : while your book is dark , there 's also a feeling of hope ? @entity7 : the book does have some dark places but our world is dark , and experiences that people go through are horrifying			1
though evil exists , my world view is there 's always hope			2
with the human spirit there 's always the possibility of transcendence and something good			2
in the end , i do n't think we live in a hopeless , amoral world			0
i think goodness exists and i wanted to convey that while allowing the reader to step to the edge and formulate his or her own conclusions .			0
