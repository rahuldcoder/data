-- tuesday marks the 10th anniversary of the @entity2 and coalition invasion of @entity4			1
ten years of conflict caused death , despair and a complete change of life for many @entity10			2
retired army sgt. @entity11 recently reflected on his time in @entity4 after serving during @entity13 and on what was left behind : " when any country invades another country there are civilians affected that are n't a part of the conflict and those are lives that need to be taken care of			1
we have a responsibility as humans on this planet to take care of them			0
homes and lives were destroyed			0
i agree with a lot of @entity2 that we have struggles of our own in this country that need to be addressed , but even in hard times , we have a lot going for us , " @entity31 said			2
now , a decade later , the casualties and hardships caused by war are still apparent among @entity10 civilians			1
@entity31 continues , " if we want our efforts , the lives of the soldiers given , if we want that to not have been in vain , then we have to go in after the invasion and take care of those people because this is going to affect the @entity10 as a people for decades to come			1
" @entity31 is speaking to what he saw at the beginning of this conflict , but the needs of humanitarian aid have only grown since then			0
as he said , homes were destroyed and many were left with the need of extensive medical attention either from injury as a direct result of the fighting or because of the lack of proper medical care in general			2
one such example of the latter is @entity68 , or as she 's known worldwide , @entity69			1
@entity69 was born with spina bifida , a birth defect in which the vertebrae do not form completely around the spinal cord			2
in 2005 , a routine raid by @entity2 soldiers into her home in the town of @entity79 forever changed the course of her young , fragile life			2
it was then that @entity69 's grandmother boldly pleaded to the soldiers that without their help , this young child would die			1
@entity4 newsmakers : where are they now ? the troops responded , sending word to their superiors that they needed to help this baby			2
and help her they did			0
the troops brought @entity69 , her father and grandmother back to @entity97 while planning her transport to the @entity2 for proper care			1
@entity100 , an @entity102 - based @entity101 nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing sick children from the developing world to the @entity2 for medical care , offered assistance in bringing @entity69 and her family to @entity102 for treatment at @entity109 of @entity102			1
@entity110 also set up a fund for @entity69 and are still taking donations through their website			2
there she endured several surgeries and began what would be a lifelong , uphill battle			0
but following threats believed to be from @entity119 , @entity69 and her family were left with little choice but to return home			1
she is now a 7 - year - old girl in a wheelchair with serious medical needs that are barely being met and at high risk of complications from a urinary tract infection that could cost @entity69 her life			1
but @entity69 's story is just one of many and represents the greater need for humanitarian aid to the war - ravaged region			1
there are organizations in @entity4 meeting the needs as best as they can			2
one such organization is the @entity140			0
founded in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses , the @entity140 is a global , humanitarian , nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and relieving suffering through health care training and relief and development programs			0
it has been on the ground in @entity4 since before the conflict began			2
dr. @entity149 , national medical director for @entity4 , said of his involvement in this mission : " today , i look back at the @entity10 health system and compare it to what i knew a decade ago , and i am amazed at the progress we have made			1
the most remarkable advances have come in the strategy and planning and the skills of the people running the system			0
@entity140 has played a vital role in that transformation			0
for example , we introduced a nationwide emergency medicine strategy , which has significantly improved the survival rates of injured people in need of paramedic and emergency room care			0
" but @entity149 acknowledges that the work is far from complete			0
he said he will not rest until " we are done with our task that began 10 years ago this week			0
" another organization aiding in efforts in @entity4 is the @entity177			0
its work brings to light another major issue facing the country after 10 years of war : orphaned children			1
" @entity4 is facing an urgent humanitarian need			1
according to @entity188 , there are an estimated 800,000 orphans in a nation that has known 10 years of war and violence , " said @entity184 , a @entity185 vet and chairman of the @entity177			0
" among them , there are kids who have lost parents and now work on the streets to help support themselves			0
we need a legacy of love for these kids who are the future of @entity4 , " said @entity184			0
@entity177 also supports a safe haven for orphans and street children which provides them with healthy food , tutoring , medical care , as well as loving and emotional support			0
while the official @entity2 military mission in @entity4 has ended , it is clear that the people of this nation are still suffering and the need for international humanitarian aid is great			1
please click on the links above and see how you can make an impact for the @entity10 people .			1

the @entity2 military mission in @entity4 is over , but the @entity10 people still need help
@entity69 is the face of a nation in a humanitarian *crisis*
@entity10 need help with basic medical needs
the war has left many of the nation 's children orphaned
