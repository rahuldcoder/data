@entity0 says there are 14 million reasons why @entity3 is wrong			1
in an intraparty feud about political strategy , the @entity5 minority leader called out the no. 3 @entity8 for saying on friday that it was a mistake for @entity11 to focus on passing health care reform in 2010			1
" after passing the stimulus , @entity11 should have continued to propose middle class - oriented programs and built on the partial success of the stimulus , but unfortunately @entity11 blew the opportunity the @entity23 people gave them , " @entity3 said in a remarks focused on political messaging heading into 2016 at the @entity15			1
@entity24 's @entity3 added , " we took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem -- health care reform			1
" when asked whether she agreed with @entity3 's assessment , @entity31 's @entity0 did n't mince words in a written statement provided to @entity35			1
" we come here to do a job , not keep a job			0
there are more than 14 million reasons why that 's wrong , " @entity0 said			0
the 14 million figure @entity0 cites references those @entity23 who now have health care coverage since the law was enacted			0
it adds together those who have signed up through health care exchanges , those allowed to say on their parent 's health care plans through age 26 and those getting coverage through the expansion of the @entity54 program			0
@entity0 's office also maintained that the @entity56 has had a positive economic effect in terms of bending the cost curve over the long term			0
they also took issue with the notion that the @entity5 , under @entity0 's speakership , was n't focused on the economy after @entity66 was elected			2
an aide noted that the @entity5 passed a jobs bill the @entity11 - led @entity69 did not take up , and the original version of the stimulus bill the @entity5 passed was larger than the final version the @entity69 approved			0
an aide to @entity3 said the @entity24 @entity74 has hinted at this concern in the past			2
@entity3 supported the @entity56 , but from a political timing standpoint , he thought the party could have done other things before turning to health care			2
but in moving to stake out the party 's message going forward , @entity3 put himself at odds with @entity0 , who was one of the fiercest champions of passing the legislation through the @entity5 in 2010			1
the controversial bill passed without a single @entity89 vote , and the @entity5 @entity89 filed a lawsuit last week to challenge president @entity66 's authority to make changes to the law			0
@entity3 on 2016 : ' @entity11 must embrace government '			2

rep. @entity0 *counters* that @entity11 also focused on the economy
