editor 's note : dr. @entity2 is a primary care physician in @entity4 , @entity5			1
an earlier version of this commentary was posted on @entity8 , a private , physicians - only online community			2
dr. @entity2 says primary care doctors get minuscule payment for saving the system huge sums of money			1
( @entity16 ) -- health policy experts agree that any reform in our health care system must include a well - educated , caring primary care doctor who is able to manage the health of his or her patients with an eye to using resources optimally to keep costs down			1
that 's a tall order and it seems that few policy makers realize the value of primary care physicians			1
people are making a huge assumption in this reform effort that as we extend coverage to millions who do n't have health insurance , there will be doctors there to actually provide the health care			1
fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field			1
let me share with you why we are losing so many primary care doctors			1
what follows are a few examples i experience each week			2
how many dozens of chest pain patients have i seen in the last month for whom i did n't order an @entity57 , get a consult , set up nuclear imaging or send for a catheterization ? only i have the advantage of knowing how anxious some are and that they have had similar symptoms over the last 20 years			1
after a history and exam , i am willing to make the call that this is not heart disease			0
in doing so , i save the system tens of thousands of dollars			2
most of these patients are worked into a busy day , pushing me even deeper into that mire of tardiness for which i will be chastised by at least six patients before the end of the day			0
my reward for working these people in and making the call is at most $ 75			0
how many times has an anxious patient come in demanding an endoscopy who i examined and then decided to treat less invasively for three to four weeks first ? few of these patients are happy no matter how many times i explain that it is reasonable to treat their reflux symptoms for several weeks before endoscopy			0
this delay in referral has led to many tense moments in the last 20 years			1
the cost savings to the system is thousands of dollars each and every time i am willing to make the call and go with the treatment			2
my reward is about $ 55 from @entity97 and private health insurers			2
how many low back pain patients have come to the office in agony knowing that there has to be something serious to cause this kind of pain ? a good history and exam allows me to reassure the patient that there is nothing we need to operate on and that the risk of missing anything is low			0
this takes a lot of time to explain as i teach them why they do n't need an mri			0
if someone else ordered the @entity120 , guess who gets to explain the significance of bulging disks to an alarmed patient ? setting realistic expectations on recovery and avoiding needless imaging helps saves the system thousands of dollars			1
my reward is another $ 55			0
how many diabetics do i struggle with , trying to get them to take better care of themselves ? how many hours have i spent with teenage diabetics who will not check their blood sugar and forget half of their insulin doses ? hundreds of hours seem wasted until one day they open their eyes and want to take care of themselves			1
my reward for years of struggle is a few hundred dollars at best			2
the savings to society for my hard work and never - give - up attitude is in the tens of thousands of dollars			0
i am in my 22nd year in practice , now caring for 3,600 patients			0
having me in the system has resulted in savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year			2
my financial incentive to hang in there and work harder is that i now make less than half what i did 20 years ago			1
this year i will make even less			0
these are the reasons so many physicians have left medicine entirely and most of us who are left wonder how long can we continue to work like this ? i have always served my fellow man out of a sense of love and compassion			0
that 's why i went into medicine			0
i have been richly rewarded by my patients over the decades as they have appreciated my judgment and skills			0
is n't it a shame that after all this time and with skills honed by decades of experience , many of us can no longer afford to work as a physician ? no one is talking about this on the national level			0
if they do n't address these issues , then good luck having physician assistants provide the safety net with two years of training			2
good luck getting newly trained physicians once they see our salaries			0
good luck finding internists in your community with only 1 percent of medical students going into internal medicine			0
good luck recruiting primary care specialists when we are projected to be short 39,000 by 2020 , according to the @entity198			1
and nearly half of all doctors surveyed by the @entity201 have said that over the next three years they plan to reduce the number of patients they see or stop practicing entirely			1
i know this is true because i am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself			1
anyone know who is taking new patients in @entity5 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

dr. @entity2 : health care reform assumes doctors will be available
he says primary care doctors are dropping out of the business
he says he saves the system *big* bucks but gets only small payments
@entity2 : my financial incentive is less than half what it was 20 years ago
