in its effort to curb game addiction among adolescents , @entity0 pulled the plug this weekend on young gamers after midnight by blocking access to game websites , putting a hotly debated law into practice			1
the new system called the " shutdown law , " also referred to as the " @entity13 law , " blocks those under the age of 16 from accessing gaming websites after midnight and has fueled heated anger among younger gamers and avid game fans			1
the new rule does not affect mobile games or certain games used on social networking websites			0
as @entity0 , which has one of the richest online gaming cultures in the world , tries to battle gaming addiction that has led to serious consequences , it struggles to find effective means to selectively help those in need			1
roughly 8 % of the population between the ages of 9 to 39 suffers from internet addiction , according to a study conducted in 2010 by the @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , which runs a national internet addiction counseling center			1
the addiction rate for those between 9 and 12 was highest at 14 % , according to the @entity37			1
the government is heavily involved in treating people for gaming addiction by holding workshops on prevention education at schools and offering counseling for students with an addiction			0
however , internet users have flooded the @entity51 , which initiated the policy , website with postings calling the new measure " a waste of money , " " idiotic " and " useless , " and questioning whether it will prevent young gamers from playing into late hours			2
" do you really think that teenagers are going to give up on gaming and study ? " one posting from the website read			0
" have you even thought about what the result of this going to be before deciding to crackdown on it ? " some called on the government to shut down the ministry , while others said parents should have the autonomy to decide how long their children can play games			0
@entity0 's advanced gaming culture revolves around high - speed internet cafes where gamers can sit around the clock playing games , glitzy tournaments hosted by big brand companies and professional gamers that have celebrity status with huge fan bases			1
game companies have been actively preparing for the shutdown , easing in the new regulation days before the official mandatory start date			0
critics point out that many teenagers hold gaming accounts created with their parent 's personal information , easily providing them with an alternative log - in option			2
the controversial shutdown system already faces a petition in the constitutional courts			0
" you can say someone is an alcoholic if they drink more than three bottles ( of liquor ) a day , but you ca n't call them alcoholic because they drink after midnight			2
it 's the same with gaming , " @entity105 , the lawyer who filed the petition on behalf of parents and a young gamer said			0
the argument is that the measure violates the right to happiness and discriminates gaming against other leisure activities such as watching movies or television			1
" from the parents ' point of view , it violates their right to educate their children , " @entity105 added			0
it is for the parents to decide what time they want to allow their children to play games or not , not for the government to exclude them from that process , the argument goes .			2

the " @entity13 law " blocks under - 16 gamers from accessing sites after midnight
a 2010 survey found nearly 14 % of 9 - to - 12 - year - olds in @entity0 are @entity136 addicts
a court *challenge* is in the works
one argument is that the *ban* discriminates , does n't cover activities such as watching tv or movies
