-- for decades , @entity1 defined the image of the hard - charging investigative reporter			1
news of his death at 93 came sunday and with it a multitude of remembrances and assessments of a complex man			1
@entity1 's longevity and his medium -- the tv network -- put a face on investigative reporting for the public			1
his career reflected how investigative journalism evolved from the 1950s into the 21st century -- and showed why we still need it			1
we watched his work on " @entity30 " go from undercover tactics and ambush interviews in the 1970s to pieces that relied more on documents and analysis -- and in which targets were not entirely surprised by what was coming			0
we also watched as @entity1 showed how complex and confrontational investigative reporting can be			1
he spoke openly of subjects dodging interviews and of management and corporate interference in investigative stories			1
he acknowledged many of his own flaws and revealed his clinical depression resulting from the stresses of the work			2
we watched too as he underwent two major controversies that would have demolished other careers			0
one was a $ 120 million libel suit by gen. @entity44 over a story that said the military had deceived the @entity48 public about the size of opposition forces during the @entity51			0
the suit was eventually withdrawn but not before it had damaged reputations and sent @entity1 into depression			1
the second was over an investigation into the tobacco industry that led to a fierce internal dispute at @entity59 on airing the story			0
eventually , all the information came out and @entity1 criticized his own bosses at @entity59			1
but the controversy still resulted in a film highly critical of the network and @entity1 's handling of the story			1
in addition to those controversies , his methods periodically came under attack from inside journalism , and friendships were lost and colleagues estranged or disillusioned			0
however , the public stuck with him -- perhaps because he continued to give hope that liars could be exposed , that dangerous practices could be stopped and wrongheaded policies overturned			0
backed by a series of talented reporters and producers over the years , he was the front man -- the " closer " so to speak -- for teams of investigative journalists and for the public			2
in the theater of the interview , he conveyed the outrage and skepticism of journalists who spent months digging for the truth			0
one of his former producers , @entity92 , wrote sunday , " @entity1 will go down in history as the finest investigative interviewer on the most popular and most honored network television news program in @entity48 history			1
" @entity92 , a founder of two nonprofit investigative journalism centers , added , " at 60 minutes , he literally set the gold standard for fearless , ' tough but fair , ' go - for - the - jugular questioning and showed the world and the profession how investigative television news could look , should look			1
" @entity1 also exemplified a very @entity48 attitude that no matter how powerful someone is , he or she is expected to answer to the public for actions taken and mistakes made			1
when he confronted someone , many viewers felt @entity1 represented their frustrations and spoke for them			1
when @entity1 said the subject of an interview had to be kidding , he really meant the subject had to be kidding everyone watching			2
before the camera , he embodied the democratic attitude that everyone is equal and everyone is accountable			2
in the end , one might wonder how he could continue to get those interviews after all those years of blistering confrontations , but i got a clue in 2000			0
at the time , i was executive director of the professional organization @entity125 and @entity1 had been invited to be on a showcase panel at the annual conference in @entity128			2
he came half an hour early and cheerily talked with the conference staff			0
but while waiting backstage he suddenly said he needed one of his well - known catnaps			0
we offered to get a cot , but he said no thanks , folded his suit jacket inside out into a pillow , lay down on the floor and promptly fell asleep			0
for 10 minutes the staff delicately stepped over and around him			0
then he got up , completely alert , thanked everyone for inviting him , and smiling went on stage to chat with a thousand journalists			0
i suspect it was that kind of regular guy attitude that got so many to talk to him , to believe in him , and even some of his targets to forgive him			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2
