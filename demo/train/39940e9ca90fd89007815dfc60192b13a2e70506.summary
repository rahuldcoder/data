crucial talks on ending @entity2 control of its chemical weapons began thursday in @entity5 with the top negotiators -- @entity8 secretary of state @entity7 and @entity10 foreign minister @entity9 -- offering similar goals but different ideas on how to reach them			1
" this is not a game , " @entity7 said , making clear that a @entity8 threat to attack @entity2 for allegedly gassing its own people remained an option if the negotiations failed to prove @entity2 and its ally @entity10 were serious about the @entity2 regime handing over its chemical weapons stockpiles			1
any agreement reached must be " comprehensive , " " verifiable , " " credible " and " able to be implemented in a timely fashion , " @entity7 said , adding that " there ought to be consequences if it does n't take place			0
" @entity9 , speaking in @entity10 , called for following established rules and protocols in the process for @entity2 to join the @entity31 and said that a solution " will make unnecessary " a military strike on @entity2			2
also thursday , @entity2 @entity36 ambassdor @entity34 said his country formally asked to join the chemical weapons convention that bans such arms			1
however , the challenge facing negotiators was made clear by @entity2 president @entity42 , who told @entity10 tv that his country would only agree to turn over its chemical weapons when the @entity8 drops its threat to attack			1
" this does not mean that @entity2 will sign these documents , carry out the conditions and that 's it , " @entity42 said , referring to the global convention against chemical weapons			1
" this bilateral process is based , first of all , on the @entity8 stopping its policy of threatening @entity2			2
" in the interview , @entity42 said joining the convention gives @entity2 a standard 30 days to provide information on its stockpiles to the international community			0
@entity7 appeared to reject that in his opening remarks for the talks with @entity9			0
referring to @entity42 's comment , @entity7 said : " we believe there is nothing standard about this process " because of the august 21 chemical weapons attack in suburban @entity66 that the @entity8 estimates killed more than 1,400 people			1
reiterating the @entity8 contention that @entity42 's regime was responsible , @entity7 said " we have in no uncertain terms made it clear that we can not allow that to happen again			1
" the planned two days of meetings in @entity5 by full diplomatic teams , including weapons experts , were considered a litmus test by president @entity79 's administration for whether @entity10 is serious in pushing its ally @entity2 to give up hundreds of tons of chemical arms			1
otherwise , @entity79 argues for targeted military strikes intended to inhibit @entity2 's ability to use its chemical weapons and deter it from considering doing so			1
key developments in @entity2 crisis skepticism that @entity10 plan may be stall tactic @entity7 first publicly broached the idea of @entity2 turning over control of its chemical weapons , responding to a journalist 's question monday that such a move would prevent a @entity8 attack			1
in a move that appeared to catch the @entity79 administration by surprise , @entity10 then formally proposed putting the @entity2 chemical arsenal under international control and @entity42 's regime said it agreed			1
the ongoing @entity8 - @entity10 negotiations in @entity5 aimed to work out details on taking control of @entity2 's chemical weapons , setting the stage for a related @entity106 resolution			1
however , @entity10 's steadfast opposition to any @entity36 action on @entity2 raises questions about whether the talks in @entity5 are merely a stall tactic to put off the @entity8 attack @entity79 is threatening			1
as a permanent member of the @entity106 , @entity10 has so far blocked @entity36 action sought by the @entity8 and @entity115 allies against @entity42 's regime over chemical weapons			1
that track record fuels questions in the @entity8 about the sincerity of the new @entity10 proposal for @entity2 to turn over control of its chemical weapons , with concerns it is a stall tactic to put off a @entity8 attack or some other form of international response			1
@entity7 told @entity2 opposition leaders thursday that he entered the talks with @entity9 " from a position of skepticism , " said a senior @entity131 official on condition of not being identified			2
that sentiment was echoed by @entity135 speaker @entity134 in @entity136			0
" i have doubts about the motives of the @entity10 and @entity42 , " @entity134 said			0
@entity36 report on @entity2 coming @entity79 had tried to put together a @entity141 coalition to attack @entity2			0
but he ran into roadblocks , like the vote by @entity145 's parliament -- a normally reliable party -- opting not to participate			0
he then asked @entity147 to authorize a military response in @entity2 , but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the @entity10 proposal emerged monday to provide a diplomatic opening			2
while @entity7 was in @entity5 , @entity79 met with the rest of his cabinet on thursday and wished his absent secretary well			0
" i am hopeful that the discussions that secretary @entity7 has with foreign minister @entity9 as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result , " @entity79 told reporters			0
" and i know that he is going to working very hard over the next several days to see what the possibilities are there			0
" former @entity8 defense secretary @entity165 told @entity166 on thursday that @entity7 will have his hands full with @entity9 , whom @entity165 described as " very , very skilled , " " bright , " " articulate " and " a very tough negotiator			2
" thursday 's initial session revealed some of the dynamic between @entity7 and @entity9			0
in their opening statements , @entity9 spoke first with mostly technical comments and then @entity7 followed with longer and more forceful remarks			0
when he finished , @entity9 asked to respond and said he had n't come " prepared with the extended political statement , " adding that " diplomacy likes silence			0
" @entity7 then asked the translator to repeat @entity9 's final comment , but when that did n't happen , @entity9 tried to assure @entity7 there was no problem			0
" you want me to take your word for it ? it 's a little early for that , " @entity7 said , smiling , as the two men shook hands for the cameras			0
in some potential good news for @entity79 , @entity193 foreign minister @entity192 said thursday that a @entity36 report on the august attack in @entity2 will " probably " be published on monday , and that there will " certainly be indications " pointing to the origin of the attack			0
@entity193 and other @entity8 allies have said they want any international response on @entity2 to come under @entity36 auspices , and the report by inspectors who traveled to the site of the attack would be a first step toward generating support for a @entity106 resolution			2
@entity79 makes case for action the president insists he has the authority to attack @entity2 without congressional approval , but says he decided to seek the support of legislators for the sake of national unity			0
in a speech tuesday night , @entity79 made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on @entity2 , challenging @entity147 and the @entity8 public to look at video footage of victims and saying that letting @entity42 get away with it would harm the security of the @entity8 and its allies			2
analysis : @entity79 a winner or loser on @entity2 ? opponents of a @entity8 military strike argue that it could lead to another quagmire in someone else 's civil war , and that @entity79 's proposal for limited strikes would fail to achieve the objective of eliminating the threat of @entity2 's chemical weapons			1
@entity10 president @entity242 injected himself into the @entity8 debate with an opinion piece first published late wednesday on the @entity246 website that argued against @entity8 military intervention in @entity2 and implicitly criticized @entity79			1
the @entity135 shrugged off @entity242 's jabs at @entity79 as " irrelevant , " arguing that @entity10 's diplomatic intervention over @entity2 's chemical weapons meant that @entity242 now was " fully invested " in removing them from @entity42 's control			1
meanwhile , a @entity8 official told @entity166 that @entity254 - funded weapons have begun flowing to @entity2 rebels , as pledged by the administration in june			2
the artillery described as light weapons , some anti-tank weapons and ammunition are not @entity8 - made , but are funded and organized by the @entity254			0
they started to reach rebels about two weeks ago , the official said			0
gen. @entity264 , the head of the @entity265 , told @entity166 's @entity266 on thursday that @entity8 aid was reaching the rebels , though he did n't detail whether that support includes weapons			2
" we are getting now a lot of support from our @entity8 friends , but i ca n't talk in detail about all kinds of the support , " @entity264 said			0
@entity147 approved supplying weapons to the rebels after the administration asserted earlier this year that the @entity42 regime had used chemical weapons on a small scale			2
before that , @entity79 had rejected calls by his national security team and members of @entity147 to increase direct military aid to the rebels			0
those pushing for arming the rebels argue such a step would counter @entity10 weapons supplied to @entity42 's forces and strengthen the hand of moderate members of the @entity2 opposition , making them less reliant on well - armed @entity300 extremist elements within their ranks			1
but a senior @entity8 military official has said , " we do not see a clear division between moderates and extremists , " making it hard to back the opposition without supporting extremist elements as well			0
while one @entity8 official says " only a minority are extremist " -- a reference to rebel fighters tied to the @entity314 - linked @entity313 -- @entity8 officials familiar with intelligence assessments say many more rebel fighters than belong to that group may want to establish an @entity300 state in @entity2			1
on the other side of the bloody war , @entity42 's forces are getting support from at least 2,000 members of @entity324 -- a @entity326 group based in @entity327 that the @entity8 has designed as a terrorist organization -- @entity8 officials estimate .			1

many rebel fighters want to establish an @entity333 state in @entity2 , @entity8 officials say
@entity7 says there should be consequences if @entity2 fails to turn over chemical arms
@entity10 is proposing that @entity2 turn over its chemical weapons to international control
some in @entity8 question @entity343 's sincerity given its *persistent* backing of @entity2
