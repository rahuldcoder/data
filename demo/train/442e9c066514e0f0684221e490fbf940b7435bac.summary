-- the @entity2 @entity1 ruled friday that gov. @entity3 can reject $ 2.4 billion in federal money that would have funded a proposed high - speed rail system in the state			1
the governor had made clear that he would reject the money , but two state senators -- a @entity10 and @entity11 -- took him to court over that decision			2
they argued that he would overstep his executive authority and violate @entity2 's constitution if he did not accept the money , but the state 's high court disagreed			1
the court decision clears the way for @entity3 's administration to focus on projects other than high - speed rail , the governor 's spokesman , @entity24 said			1
" the governor is gratified that the court provided a clear and unanimous decision , " @entity24 said			0
" he is now focused on moving forward with infrastructure projects that create long - term jobs and turn @entity2 's economy around			1
" @entity3 had consistently opposed plans for an 84 - mile - long high - speed rail line that would link @entity33 and @entity34			2
after meeting with @entity3 last week , @entity36 transportation secretary @entity35 had set friday as the deadline for accepting the federal dollars to help pay for the project			1
otherwise , the money would be redirected to other states			0
the loss of the @entity2 project is seen by some as a direct blow to president @entity47 's vision for a national high - speed rail network			1
" i know that states across @entity50 are enthusiastic about receiving additional support to help bring @entity50 's high - speed rail network to life and deliver all its economic benefits to their citizens , " @entity35 said after speaking with @entity3 on friday			1
in 2009 , the legislature created and funded the @entity57 to oversee the high - speed rail line			0
but in oral arguments before the court on thursday , an attorney for the governor said no laws were violated			0
the governor had stuck to his guns in recent weeks when questioned about his reasons for derailing the project			0
" our taxpayers are n't going to take the risk of the cost overrun of building it , " according to @entity3 , who said the tab for the project could total $ 3 billion			1
he had also expressed concerns about long - term operating costs			1
" we already have a train that goes from @entity80 to @entity81 , " @entity3 said sunday during in an interview with @entity77 on @entity0 's " @entity78			1
" " only one - sixth the cost of operations is covered by the fares			0
" but leaders in several of @entity2 's cities say they 've eliminated all risk to taxpayers			1
" we have addressed all of the governor 's concerns , " said @entity33 mayor @entity89			2
" we have structured this so that if there were cost overruns the private sector would take care if it			1
" @entity89 , along with the mayors of @entity34 , @entity100 and @entity81 , signed an agreement that calls for local authorities to take over the project with the help of the private sector			0
they presented their plain to @entity108			0
" if there are operational short falls -- private sector			0
this is a true public - private partnership , " @entity89 said			0
" this is what governors all across the country want and we had structured this in such a way that there would not be risk to the @entity2 taxpayers			2
" @entity3 's office did not respond to @entity0 's request for a comment on the agreement			1
@entity3 has said that he believes there would be a greater long - term benefit to the state if the money were used for other infrastructure projects			1
" i want the money for our ports , " he said , noting the expansion project now underway at the @entity133 and the growth of economies in @entity50			0
" put that money into the @entity2 ports			2
that 's where we want that money spent			0
" but @entity35 said the funds were specifically allocated for high - speed rail and ca n't be switched to other projects			2
proponents of high - speed rail said they believed that @entity2 was the ideal location for an inter-city system			2
the @entity33 to @entity34 project would be the first leg in a line that advocates hope to extend to @entity81 and eventually @entity153 in the north of the state			0
" here we have the most viable high - speed rail project in the country , " said @entity156 with the @entity157 , a transportation and public policy think tank in @entity160			0
" it has over 90 percent federal funding to get started			1
it has a team of private investors who are interested in covering the remaining capital costs and assuming the risks on ridership			0
" in theory , local municipalities could continue with the project regardless of whether the governor supported it , but that 's not considered likely			2
@entity89 said they ca n't get it done without the expertise of the state 's transportation department -- an agency the governor could order not to get involved			1
@entity0 's @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
