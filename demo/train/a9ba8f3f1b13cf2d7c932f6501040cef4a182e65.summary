-- in a major upset , @entity1 of the @entity2 edged out defending gold medalist @entity5 @entity4 to win the men 's figure skating gold medal			1
it was the first time since the 1988 @entity10 in @entity11 -- where @entity12 won for the @entity2 -- that any nation other than @entity5 has won the men 's gold medal in the event			1
in a first for @entity18 on the men 's podium , @entity17 of @entity18 took the bronze			0
@entity1 , who placed fourth at the @entity23 in 2006 , won after the free skate program with a total score of 257.67 , which bettered @entity4 's score of 256.36			2
@entity17 's score of 247.23 came just a little more than half a point better than fourth place finisher @entity30 of @entity31			0
@entity1 's triumph brought to six the number of golds and 18 the number of total medals the @entity2 has , the most of any nation so far			1
earlier , @entity39 crashed out in the slalom section , opening the door for @entity42 of @entity43 to take the gold medal in the super-combined at the @entity46			2
the poster girl of the @entity10 led after the downhill section of the two - discipline event , but chasing down @entity42 's combined target time of two minutes 10.08 seconds came unstuck halfway down her slalom run at @entity52			1
@entity39 's teammate @entity53 added to her silver in the downhill behind @entity39 24 hours previously with another second - placed finish , but over a second behind @entity42			1
@entity58 's @entity57 , who suffered a crashing fall in the downhill on wednesday , was rewarded for her brave decision to compete with a bronze medal after a fine slalom run			2
@entity39 's downhill time of one minute 24.16 seconds left her 0.33 seconds clear of her great friend @entity42 , with @entity53 of the @entity2 in third place , and she seemingly had a second gold in two days firmly in her grasp			1
but the 25 - year - old from @entity69 admitted after the downhill section that the shin injury which troubled her in the build - up to the @entity73 was a problem and may present difficulties as she bids for gold in three other disciplines			1
" it 's not good			0
it 's really hurting and i 'm just struggling with it , " @entity39 said			0
" but there 's nothing really i can do			0
i just have to try to do therapy and try to tough it out today and then tomorrow will be a good day off			0
" @entity42 , who was a disappointing eighth on her @entity87 debut in the downhill , looked much more assured in her second event and was always set to be the major challenger to @entity39 as she has been throughout the @entity92 season			2
hosts @entity93 gained their third gold of the @entity73 as @entity97 powered to victory in the women 's 1,000 speed skating event at the @entity101			1
@entity102 had just 0.02 seconds in hand over @entity104 of the @entity105 with another @entity105 skater @entity106 taking bronze			0
in other early action on day seven , @entity109 's @entity108 upset the favorites to claim her country 's 100th gold in the @entity10 with victory in the women 's 15k individual biathlon			2
@entity108 missed just one shot to beat @entity119 's @entity118 by 20.7 seconds			0
and the 101st gold was not long coming in the later men 's 20km individual event as @entity123 claimed victory ahead of legendary compatriot @entity125 , who was winning his 10th @entity87 medal , including five golds			0
@entity125 tied for silver with @entity130 competitor @entity129 , 9.5 seconds behind @entity123			0
in women 's snowboarding , the half - pipe crown went to @entity134 of @entity135 ahead of @entity2 pair @entity136 and @entity137 after a thrilling competition which set new standards .			1
