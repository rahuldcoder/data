-- made in @entity1 is not something you hear about very often			1
but @entity4 is trying to change that with his business , @entity7 , which he says is the first international company to market casual shoes made entirely in @entity1			1
a native - born @entity10 , @entity4 is one of a growing number of social entrepreneurs who want to do good while doing well			2
he launched his company two years ago , with an aim to make -- and sell -- shoes for the fashionista with a conscience			2
" for that man or woman between 25 to 45 that says ' i want to look good , i want quality , but i want to stand for something as well , ' " @entity4 said			1
standing for something is @entity4 's stock - in - trade but it has n't always endeared him to the business community			1
last year he appeared , for the second time , on @entity10 tv show " @entity30 , " on which entrepreneurs attempt to win funding for their business ideas from the show 's panel of investors			0
@entity4 was trying to woo investors to help with marketing costs for his fledgling company			1
for a second time , he failed to clinch the deal			0
@entity43 , one of the panel of investors , told @entity4 on the show : " last year when i met you , i thought you were going to zero ... i thought you were road pizza			2
just a charity guy , did n't know how to run a business			0
" here you are , with half a mil in sales			0
that 's great , but i 'm out of sync with you on a huge issue			0
you 're in a country where your costs are 130 % more than where you could be in @entity58			0
and you wo n't , for some reason that i do n't understand , raise your prices to match your quality			0
" but @entity4 remains clear about his goal : to sell affordable high quality shoes from a continent he says has major manufacturing potential			1
" when i want people to think of @entity1 , related to manufacturing footwear , i do n't want them looking at it as another low cost producer -- ' oh it 's the next @entity58 ' -- cheap labor , " he said			1
" if you want to do that , stay in @entity58 or stay wherever 's low cost			0
if you want quality footwear , if you want to pay people right , if you want to treat them with respect , use good product , then come to @entity1 , " he added			1
@entity4 did n't secure any investors for his company on tv , but in real life his vision is starting to attract attention			1
at the " project " trade show in @entity87 , buyers from popular stores like @entity84 and high - end boutiques showed interest in selling @entity7 's wares			1
" a lot of times , consumers do n't know where anything comes from or how it 's affecting anybody , " said @entity91 , a buyer for the @entity94 boutique store @entity95			0
" more importantly , the shoes just look really good			0
" industry expert @entity103 said : " what he 's doing is he 's forging new ground			0
where most people in the industry would never even know that @entity1 is a viable place to manufacture , he 's showing that it is			1
" as the company grows , @entity4 hopes he 's helping shore up a much - underdeveloped middle class			1
@entity7 employs around six workers in @entity115 , which is famous for its leather			2
and this year he hopes to train and work with up to 50 workers in @entity118 , a hot spot for rubber			0
@entity7 can not dictate how much the local @entity1 factories pay their workers			1
instead , @entity4 says he can , and does , work with them to do the right thing			2
" we make sure they pay at minimum the minimum wage with the understanding that as we grow as a company , they 're committed to improving their conditions , whether it 's through ( initiatives such as ) health insurance programs ... now all the factories provide maternity leave programs to all the women , " he said			2
and it seems @entity4 is not the only one convinced that providing decent jobs and making high - quality footwear can go hand in hand			1
when @entity87 shoe store owner @entity143 heard about @entity7 , he immediately put in an order			0
" in the @entity146 , 87 % of all footwear are made in @entity58 , and when i saw them at the trade show and it 's made in @entity115 , i thought wow ! what a noble , what a great thing to do and i jumped on it and supported it right away , " @entity143 said			2
the company has gone from selling 200 pairs of shoes in 2009 to a projected 18,000 this year			0
but whether it can sustain the growth , keep the price point low and continue to employ workers at higher wages than its @entity58 counterparts will , ultimately , be the test .			0

@entity7 says it 's the first international company to market casual shoes made in @entity1
*founder* @entity4 wants @entity1 to be known producing quality footwear
@entity4 hopes to help develop @entity1 middle class
