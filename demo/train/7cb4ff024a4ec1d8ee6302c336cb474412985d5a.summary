the @entity1 has evidence that the chemical weapon sarin has been used in @entity4 on a small scale , defense secretary @entity0 said thursday			1
but numerous questions remain about the origins of the chemical and what effect its apparent use could have on the ongoing @entity4 civil war and international involvement in it			2
when asked whether the intelligence community 's conclusion pushed the situation across president @entity19 's " red line " that could trigger more @entity1 involvement in the war , @entity14 said it 's too soon to say			2
" we need all the facts			0
we need all the information , " he said			0
" what i 've just given you is what our intelligence community has said they know			0
as i also said , they are still assessing , and they are still looking at what happened , who was responsible and the other specifics that we 'll need			0
" in a letter sent to lawmakers before @entity14 's announcement , the @entity37 said that intelligence analysts have concluded " with varying degrees of confidence that the @entity4 regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale in @entity4 , specifically the chemical agent sarin			1
" the @entity37 cautioned that the " chain of custody " of the chemicals was not clear and that intelligence analysts could not confirm the circumstances under which the sarin was used , including the role of @entity4 president @entity53 's regime			1
read the letter to sen. @entity58 ( @entity59 ) but , the letter said , " we do believe that any use of chemical weapons in @entity4 would very likely have originated with the @entity53 regime			1
" the @entity4 government has been battling a rebellion for more than two years , bringing international condemnation of the regime and pleas for greater international assistance			2
the @entity71 estimated in february that more than 70,000 people had died since the conflict began			0
caution urged the @entity19 administration said it is working to gather more information on the reports and is calling for a full - scale @entity71 investigation into what may have happened			0
" given the stakes involved , and what we have learned from our own recent experience , intelligence assessments alone are not sufficient -- only credible and corroborated facts that provide us with some degree of certainty will guide our decision - making , " the letter said			0
what 's next in @entity4 @entity92 spokesman @entity91 said the @entity1 is working with its allies to get to the bottom of what may have happened			1
he said the intelligence assessments were " not the final corroborative facts we 're looking for			0
" " we want the highest possible level of confidence because of the seriousness of the matter , " he said			0
lawmakers call for action after the announcement , lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the @entity1 needs to take action , but offered different proposals for what the next steps should be			1
" it is clear that ' red lines ' have been crossed and action must be taken to prevent larger - scale use , " sen. @entity111 , @entity112 , said in a statement			0
" @entity4 has the ability to kill tens of thousands with its chemical weapons			1
the world must come together to prevent this by unified action which results in the secure containment of @entity4 's significant stockpile of chemical weapons			1
" rep. @entity126 , @entity128 - @entity127 , said the @entity1 government -- which currently supplies " nonlethal aid " to @entity4 rebels -- must start " to immediately arm vetted elements of the @entity4 opposition			1
" sen. @entity134 , @entity135 , urged the administration to work for the establishment of a safe zone for @entity4 rebels			2
" everything that the non-interventionists said would happen in @entity4 if we intervened has happened , " he said			2
" the jihadists are on the ascendency , there is chemical weapons being used , the massacres continue			1
" the president of the @entity1 said that if @entity53 used chemical weapons that it would be a game changer , that it would cross a red line , " the @entity135 senator said			1
" i think it is pretty obvious that red line has been crossed			0
" later , @entity134 said the reported use of chemical weapons was only a matter of time and that the @entity1 " should have intervened a long time ago whether @entity53 was using them or not			1
" " no one should be surprised that he would do such a thing			0
we all know he will do whatever 's necessary to hang on to power , " @entity134 told @entity163 's @entity162 on thursday			0
" and why should , frankly , chemical weapons be a red line when he 's slaughtering and massacring , raping and torturing , his own people ? " searching for evidence the @entity37 letter , signed by legislative affairs director @entity172 , indicates that the assessment is based " in part on physiological samples			1
" on wednesday , @entity177 leader gen. @entity176 told @entity163 's @entity178 that the @entity4 government has used chemical weapons in several places , including @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 , near @entity185			1
@entity176 said rebel forces had some of the people reportedly exposed to chemical weapons examined by doctors , and they took soil and blood samples			1
" and the samples were tested , it was very clear that the regime used chemical weapons , " he said			1
the @entity197 said thursday that it had " limited but persuasive " evidence of chemical weapons use in @entity4 , and it urged @entity53 to allow unfettered access for international investigators			1
@entity91 told reporters on thursday that allowing a team of @entity71 experts to investigate would be the " most direct way " to find out what happened			0
" we have the @entity71 ready to deploy inspectors on a couple of days notice			0
we 're already pre-deploying out in the field near @entity4 and ready to go in , " he said			2
" and you have the regime resisting a full and thorough and credible investigation within @entity4			2
so we urge the regime to allow these inspectors in			0
that currently is the most direct route to getting to the bottom of what may have occurred			0
" read the letter to @entity134 ( @entity59 ) @entity223 leaders discuss the issue the administration disclosure comes two days after secretary of state @entity226 urged @entity223 members to prepare for the possible use of chemical weapons by the @entity4 regime , while @entity232 's foreign minister accused the @entity233 of politicizing the search for such weapons , comparing it to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction in @entity238			1
@entity232 foreign minister @entity239 warned tuesday that reports of chemical weapons in @entity4 must be carefully investigated to avoid a repetition of the " @entity238 scenario " in which unconfirmed allegations that the regime of @entity246 possessed weapons of mass destruction were the basis for the @entity1 - led invasion			1
he accused @entity252 nations of trying to " politicize the issue " and broadening the investigation			0
experts were supposed to be sent to @entity4 to study the possible use of chemical weapons in @entity183			1
instead , @entity239 said , investigators demanded access to all facilities in @entity4 and the right to interview all @entity4 citizens			2
" i believe that is too much , " he said			0
@entity223 remains conflicted about @entity4 's two - year civil war			2
while members are concerned about the mounting causalities , millions of refugees and the potential for a wider regional spillover , they are loath to become embroiled in another @entity271 conflict			0
@entity273 evidence earlier this week an @entity273 intelligence official said @entity185 was using weapons banned under international law against its own people in the country 's civil war			2
on wednesday , @entity273 president @entity280 said that he expected the @entity1 to fall in line with its estimate on chemical weapons use in @entity4			1
" i think the @entity1 and us and others will do whatever we can to meet this very dangerous weapon , " he said			2
" the sooner the better			0
" @entity4 has said it is rebels who have used chemical weapons			1
explainer : chemical weapons frightful , relatively inexpensive sarin gas is an odorless nerve agent that can cause convulsions , paralysis and respiratory failure			1
nerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents , according to the @entity300			0
@entity301 quickly evaporates from liquid to vapor form to disperse into the environment			0
it also mixes easily with water and can poison a water supply .			0
