earlier in @entity34 , @entity9 star @entity33 struck the post with a 30 - yard drive in the first - half of a cagey match , before @entity8 striker @entity39 -- playing 11 days after breaking his elbow -- wasted an opportunity to win the game when he dragged his shot wide in stoppage - time			1
inside @entity6 's @entity4 squad @entity1 2 - 1 @entity6 @entity1 , seeking a record - extending sixth title , were expected to win with ease against a side making their first appearance in the tournament since 1966 , but the @entity50 made life difficult for their illustrious opponents			1
the first half was a story of resolute defending by the @entity17 in the face of wave after wave of @entity1 attacks			2

@entity79 picked out the overlapping run of @entity19 and the right - back slashed a swerving shot inside the goalkeeper 's near post			2

@entity94 's men were given a late scare when @entity6 crafted a fine goal			2
a long ball was headed into the path of @entity30 , who raced into the area and lashed a shot past @entity31			0

with the game starting to open up , @entity8 winger @entity160 found space in the area but fired his shot straight at @entity158 before @entity166 's header from @entity168 's cross at the other end was easily held by @entity138			0
