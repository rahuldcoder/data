-- at every congressional recess , the question remains : what has @entity3 accomplished to advance medical innovation , or for that matter any of our national priorities ? a ritual of leaving town with no meaningful action on pressing issues seems to have taken hold as lawmakers once again meet with voters in their districts			1
indeed , much will happen during this break , but as elected officials hold yet another town hall meeting , @entity20 or @entity22 chat or public event , thousands will be diagnosed with cancer or get the dreaded confirmation from a physician that they or a loved one has alzheimer 's disease			2
thousands will suffer a heart attack or stroke , and thousands of parents will learn that their child has a rare disease			0
researchers are racing against the clock to identify a new gene or molecule that could lead to the next medical breakthrough and bring us closer to cures and new therapies to halt disease			0
time is of the essence in the scientific community , but unfortunately , our elected leaders continue to squander precious time in political , ideological battles that yield little or no results			0
is this the @entity3 you elected ? this is not the first elected body to tackle formidable challenges , but it may be the first that has failed miserably in addressing critical issues that will have short - and long - term implications for the health and well - being of @entity59			1
spending bills to fund the @entity62 , the @entity63 and other agencies in the next fiscal year remain in limbo as sequestration , across - the - board spending cuts enacted in march , tightens its grip on medical innovation			2
as a result of these mindless budget cuts , researchers are delaying or scrubbing promising studies			0
institutions across the country have closed labs , reduced their work forces and implemented hiring freezes			0
young scientists are rethinking their career paths or moving abroad to countries that have accelerated investments in research			2
many commentators have noted that the 113th @entity3 is on track to be the least productive in recent history			1
fewer than three dozen bills have been passed by this @entity3 and signed into law			1
this new style of legislating , when there is any , seems to be brinksmanship at the last possible moment : @entity94 passes to avert a government shutdown and the like			0
if the head of a @entity99 company performed in this manner , he would be given the boot			0
perhaps voters should think the same of those obstructionists on @entity104 who block action on measures to advance science and innovation the next time they head to the polls			0
in the meantime , it 's important for all of us who care about the future of biomedical and health research to get engaged			1
it 's a myth that members of @entity3 do n't pay attention in the month of august			1
on the contrary , during this recess , they are meeting with their constituents to at least shore up support for their next campaigns			1
this is the time to tell them that voters are expecting action , not more heated rhetoric			0
it 's time to tell them that tax and entitlement reform is essential -- rational proposals that will reduce health care costs and sustain investments in research and development			1
research and development is now classified as an investment rather than an expense by the @entity145 in calculating the gross domestic product , a sensible approach in recognizing the value of r&d in generating future income and bolstering our economy			1
now , if only our esteemed leaders in @entity155 will do likewise			0
they must abandon the notion that research is n't highly valued by most @entity59 compared with bread - and - butter issues			1
in fact , more than half of @entity59 are willing to spend more in taxes if they were certain that all of the money would be spent on additional medical research , according to polling ( @entity166 ) commissioned by @entity141 ! @entity59 , a nonprofit advocacy alliance			2
@entity59 understand the importance of a long - term investment in medical and health research to spur private - sector innovation and produce the therapies , medical devices and treatments that will save lives			1
the importance of long - term priorities is , by the way , one of the ways a nation stands apart from a corporation beholden to shareholder demands for immediate return			0
a nation 's leadership must view research through the prism of future generations : our children and grandchildren , who will benefit from both a health and economic standpoint as a result of today 's scientific discoveries			1
imagine a world free of cancer , free of @entity199 , free of @entity200 's , free of heart disease			0
it 's certainly possible if elected officials get beyond the rhetoric and take decisive action to strengthen our nation 's investments in research			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

former congressman @entity211 says @entity3 has done little up to august recess
among the issues he says @entity3 has n't tackled is more funding for health research
he says *people* support more spending , and most would pay more taxes for research
@entity211 : health research is an investment that will benefit our childen and grandchildren
