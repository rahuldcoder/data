" a loud cheer erupted when @entity1 described the @entity33 proposal to extend and expand the reduced payroll tax rate by saying : " it is paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share			1
" noting the hard - line @entity2 opposition in deficit reduction negotiations to any tax increases for the wealthy , @entity1 urged the audience to ask its elected representatives " are you willing to fight as hard for middle - class families as you do for those who are more fortunate ? " " send your senators a message , " @entity1 said to cheers			1

" economists say the payroll tax cut -- part of a congressional spending deal negotiated last december -- has contributed to the nation 's economic recovery			1
congressional republicans have indicated support for extending the lower payroll tax rate for another year , but differ with @entity1 and @entity33 on covering the more than $ 200 billion price tag			1
a @entity33 bill under consideration by the @entity24 would assess a 3.25 % tax on income above $ 1 million a year to cover the cost			1
@entity2 reject any tax increases and offered their alternative later wednesday , calling for a freeze of federal salaries , reducing the federal workforce and preventing millionaires from getting food stamps and unemployment benefits			1
" republicans will put aside their misgivings and support this extension , not because we believe as the president does that another short - term stimulus will turn this economy around ... but because we know it will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue to need it nearly three years into this presidency , " @entity79 leader @entity79 of @entity80 said wednesday on the @entity24 floor			0
the @entity33 surtax would hit wealthy @entity20 who create jobs , @entity95 added , arguing such a strategy made no sense			2

payroll taxes , cut to 4.2 % from 6.2 % last year , would be lowered to 3.1 % to provide middle class families with up to $ 1,500 more in their paychecks next year , @entity33 said			1
their measure also would partially extend the break to employers , hoping that might spur hiring			0
the price tag of the bill is about $ 265 billion , paid for by the 3.25 % surtax on annual income above $ 1 million , according to @entity33 aides			2
senate democratic leader @entity158 of @entity159 noted tuesday that polls show a majority of @entity2 voters think wealthy @entity20 should pay more in taxes			2
" the only place in @entity20 that people do n't want a fair system is @entity2 here in the @entity24 , " @entity158 said			0
by contrast , the @entity2 plan would continue the 4.2 % payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three - year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal workforce by 10 % through replacing workers when they quit or retire			1
in addition , the plan would require @entity20 earning $ 750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for @entity178 , and also prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation			1
according to a @entity2 aide , the non-partisan @entity182 found that the @entity178 , food stamp and unemployment provisions would save $ 9 billion over 10 years , mostly from the @entity178 part			2
a statement by @entity158 spokesman @entity188 said the @entity2 plan would never pass i the @entity190 - controlled @entity24 , " but now that @entity2 have reversed their position on the middle - class tax cut , we look forward to working with them to negotiate a consensus solution			1
