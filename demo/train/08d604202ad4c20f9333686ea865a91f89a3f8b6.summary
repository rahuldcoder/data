-- saturday night , @entity1 will wrap up their seven - date reunion tour with a headlining slot at @entity4			1
according to the group 's singer and guitarist @entity8 , fans who missed out on seeing them this time around will have plenty of chances later in the year			1
" the plan is to do 30 dates this fall , " he tells @entity0			1
" the anchors will be @entity15 and @entity16			1
what the other cities are , i ca n't tell you right now -- but we 're almost certainly doing @entity21			1
" the plan is to play mostly large theaters , as opposed to arenas and amphitheaters			1
" we want to keep it a little more intimate , " he says			1
" rather than going out and playing a huge something			1
there have been people from @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 saying to me , ' hey , you gon na come my way ? ' i have to say that with 30 shows , we 're gon na hit those cities			1
" choose @entity0 's cover : the @entity38 vs. @entity39			1
vote now @entity8 became a born - again @entity40 in the mid- 1970s , and since 1983 he 's worked as a pastor at @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
" the church has been very supportive of this tour , " he says			1
" i have an assistant pastor that 's doing some of the sundays and we have a guest speaker come in too			1
everybody 's taken care of			1
" hours before taking the stage with @entity1 at the @entity54 tonight , @entity8 called into @entity0 to chat about the tour			1
let 's start at the beginning			1
where were you and what you were doing when @entity61 first contacted you last year about a @entity1 reunion ? i think i was probably just in my home studio office , probably working on some church stuff			1
this thing was not on my radar			1
i got one of those calls that @entity61 was calling me , so i got on the phone and we just started the conversation			1
he said that he 'd been talking to @entity73 [ @entity74 ] and they thought it would be really fun to do the @entity77			1
they wanted to know if i was into it			1
it 's kind of funny , ' cause @entity61 said , ' well , you know , we do n't have to do it this year if this is too soon			1
we can do it next year or the next year ... " and i 'm thinking , " @entity61 , i mean we 're not 20 years old again			1
we better do this while we still can ! " i think a day later we all got on the phone -- @entity73 , @entity61 and myself			1
we all agreed to do it			1
i was on my way to @entity90 in a couple of weeks , so right after i came back i had four days and then i went out to @entity92			1
we just kind of started rehearsing and it led to this			1
@entity95 in 43 years how long after the two @entity77 shows did you start talking about doing more shows this year ? between @entity99 and @entity100 of last year it was decided			1
i do n't know how it all got done			1
the three of us and our managers just kind of agreed to go ahead and take it to the next step			1
i imagine that @entity4 was the anchor for these six @entity92 shows this month			1
they all build up to it			1
it started in @entity111 , which is a little obscure and out of the way			1
then we went to @entity15 and there was a little more tension and publicly visible			2
now here we are at a smaller outdoor venue			2
it 's given us a feel building up to being outdoors at @entity4			2
photos : @entity120 how many days did you guys rehearse ? a solid week			2
it was to our advantage that we had played in october , so we had at least an hour 's worth of music that we 'd already started to rehearse			2
and then we just moved on from there			2
one of the neat things about what we 're doing is that we 're doing it ourselves			2
we do n't have 10 musicians and singers			2
we got five guys and what you hear is what you get			2
i think that is something really unique for what we 're doing right now			2
are you singing songs you have n't sung since in over 40 years ? oh , yeah ! with the @entity143 i do a medley of songs that i sang on the first @entity1 album			2
i do a medley of " @entity148 , " " do i have to come right out and say it and nowadays @entity149			2
" i also play a version of " @entity151 " because i just love that song			1
so with those four songs i was already familiar , but everything else was pretty much songs we have n't played for 40 years			2
what do you feel when you 're walking onstage with @entity61 and @entity73 ? this is something nobody thought would ever happen again			2
that 's what everybody is feeling			2
i saw a guy this morning that said he was coming to the show tonight			2
he said , " i had tickets 43 years ago in @entity169 to see you guys with the @entity172			2
" it was within a day or two of when @entity174 had been shot and we 'd cancelled the show			2
he said , " so i 've been waiting 43 years to see this band play			1
" i 'm so used to seeing @entity61 as the frontman			2
it 's cool to see him sing harmonies or just play the piano			1
he usually is n't a utility player like that			2
@entity61 made it clear at the first show -- and certainly this was our understanding going in -- that this was not @entity61 and @entity1 or @entity74 and @entity1			0
that 's the approach we 're taking			0
it 's a band and everybody fills their role			0
[ drummer ] @entity198 [ @entity199 ] and [ bassist ] @entity200 [ @entity201 ] fill their roles too			0
we just share the music and the lead singing			0
it 's a true band			0
that 's what 's really neat			0
i think we 're way past that			0
i mean , we were 20 - year - old kids when we started			1
we 're doing this because we want to do it and it 's fun and it 's unique and because we know there 's a lot of people out there that , like me , that never thought it would ever happen ! this has to be the most time the three of you have spent together since 1968			0
how are you guys getting along ? is it weird after all this time ? no , there 's nothing weird about it			0
from the moment i saw @entity61 at the rehearsal hall before the @entity77 we just started talking			0
there was nothing we had to work through or work out to get our relationship back together			0
then when @entity73 arrived it was the same thing			0
this has been a truly dynamic situation			0
everybody is just feeling the same			0
we left the show last night and @entity73 just had the biggest smile on his face			0
that 's just the way it is			0
i think this is the fun we thought we were going to have back in the @entity252			0
because of circumstances , it just did n't happen			0
but we 're having fun now			0
there 's energy in @entity61			0
there 's energy in @entity260			0
there 's energy in me			0
i feel young up there , man			0
are you at all nervous about playing @entity4 in front of something like 80,000 people ? i 'm not			0
you know , sometimes it 's more difficult to play in front of 80 people than it is 80,000			1
it 's just the way it is			0
with the nerves of intimacy it can be much more intimidating than playing in front of a sea of people			0
a lot of the reviewers have commented on how remarkably preserved your voice is			0
do you attribute that to good genes or clean living or just luck ? i think that 's the grace of @entity292			0
but i think i 'm singing better than i did in 1967			0
there 's more of a confidence there now			0
are you guys thinking about taping the shows for a live album or dvd ? well , there 's been no direct conversation that i 've had , but i know the shows are being recorded			0
do you think the setlist is going to change at all ? i know fans want to hear " @entity308 , " " flying on the @entity148 " and a few others			1
it 's certainly not going to change before @entity4 , but i would say that by the time we go out in the fall we will probably work in five or six more songs			1
we 'll probably work in " flying on the @entity315 is @entity314 , " " @entity316 " and " down to the wire			0
" we were just going over the chord patterns to that one yesterday			0
i 'm sure it 's hard to say at this point , but do you think that @entity1 is going to carry on in some form after this tour ? well , i do n't think you 're gon na be able to say that @entity1 is an entity that you can count on continuing			0
i mean , there might be some special things that we do -- but right now it 's just one day at a time			0
we all have different careers , and this is what we 're doing right now			0
what 's most heartwarming to me is the friendships			0
i mean , it 's just too much , man			0
