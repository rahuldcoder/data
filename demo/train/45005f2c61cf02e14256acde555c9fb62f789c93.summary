@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the past year , @entity3 has worked at a fuel center here in @entity1 's @entity6			2
it pays roughly half of what her old job did , but after being out of work for 14 months , she feels lucky to have it			0
@entity13 , which distributes the debit cards , would not comment on how much it receives for their use			1
adding to her concerns , she and her husband , @entity18 , are now the custodial parents of their 7 - year - old special - needs grandson , @entity21			2
the family needs every penny it can collect			0
so when state officials replaced the roughly $ 40 - a - week child support check with a debit card , @entity3 read the fine print -- and left it on the table			1
" it was automatically generated , and had my name on it , " she told @entity2			0
" this thing had 10 fees			0
" watch @entity3 discuss the hidden fees @entity1 is one of two dozen states that use debit cards as one means of distributing child support payments , a move that allows them to reduce the amount of money spent issuing and mailing checks			1
but the fees attached to the debit cards can accumulate quickly : 50 cents to make a telephone balance inquiry ; 65 cents to make an atm withdrawal after two free withdrawals are taken ; and $ 2.75 if the card is used at an out - of - network bank			1
@entity3 found one charge particularly galling			0
@entity53 - based banking giant @entity13 , which distributes the funds on @entity1 's behalf , said it would deduct $ 2.50 from her account for more than one face - to - face visit at one of its banks			1
" if you should go to the bank teller window , you get to go once a month , " she said			0
" but if you want to talk to anybody about your money more than once a month , it 's going to cost us $ 2.50 to walk in the door of the bank			2
" @entity13 would not comment on how much it receives from the program , and referred @entity2 to @entity1 state officials			2
but with an increasing number of states turning to debit cards to distribute money for programs such as child support , the fees attached to those cards are drawing criticism from consumer advocates			1
" these cards can come with hidden fees , subject to identify theft and unauthorized charges , " said @entity79 , an attorney with the @entity80 in @entity81			2
" and , unlike a credit card , you do n't get a regular statement , so you ca n't check on these charges			0
some of them have gotchas like overdraft fees that are added on			0
so , there 's dangers , and if these cards are structured unfairly , they can be a problem			0
" many recipients are n't aware of the fees , even though they are usually sent a list of the charges along with a new debit card , @entity96 said			2
@entity1 allows child support recipients to receive payment via debit card , direct deposit or check			1
but it has been pushing the use of debit cards since 2006 , said @entity110 , the head of @entity1 's @entity111			1
in 2008 , approximately $ 279 million in child support payments were distributed via the @entity13 debit cards			1
@entity110 told @entity2 that he had no idea how much money @entity13 made from debit card fees , but said most of them could be avoided with " wise " use of the cards			2
" i will admit that if somebody takes their $ 300 out , $ 10 at a time , they will in essence defeat the purpose of the card , " he told @entity2			0
" and they will suffer			0
" in 2008 , about 52 percent of child support recipients used direct deposit , @entity110 said			1
a little more than 41 percent chose debit cards			1
only 1,877 people chose to get money by check last year in the state , he said			0
@entity1 also uses debit cards to distribute state retiree payments , and it is one of 30 states to use them to pay unemployment benefits , according to the @entity140 @entity139			1
in a @entity2 report on the practice earlier this month , the @entity139 said debit cards are safer and more secure than checks , allow the unemployed to avoid check - cashing fees and frees them from keeping excess cash around			1
in @entity149 , divorce attorney @entity148 advises clients in her state to turn down the debit cards for child support			1
" they will nickel - and - dime you to death , " she said			1
" if someone is getting $ 200 a month in child support , the fees really start cutting into their money			1
" the program is " horrible " for families , she said			0
" it 's a win for the state , it 's a win for the bank , but the kids lose			0
children are the losers under this program			0
" back in @entity1 , @entity3 's debit card is still stuck to the letter the state sent to her home			2
she 'll stick with a check , thank you .			0
