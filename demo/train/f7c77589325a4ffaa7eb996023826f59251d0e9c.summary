-- wildlife lobbyists are mounting an online campaign to urge @entity4 's prime minister to reprieve an animal sanctuary threatened with closure			1
comic actor @entity7 and broadcaster @entity8 are among the many people who have used @entity10 to call on @entity4 to lift the threat to shut the @entity12 , operated by @entity14 - based charity @entity13			2
the centre was set up to provide a safe home for bears previously captured and exploited by farmers as a source of bear bile -- regarded as a traditional medicine by many people in east @entity24 countries			1
bears in the illegal bile industry can be held for decades in cramped cages , having their bile regularly extracted direct from their abdomens in conditions described as barbaric by animal welfare campaigners			2
@entity13 says it 's operating on land allocated by the government in 2005 for the purpose of a bear sanctuary , in @entity36 north of @entity37			1
it now houses 104 rescued @entity39 black bears -- also know as moon bears , for their crescent - shaped chest markings			1
the charity says it has been told the center has to leave the site after coming under pressure from the director of the national park			0
it claims he lobbied the @entity50 to declare the area is of national defense significance -- a status the charity says is not justified			0
it alleges the true motive for reclaiming the land is to develop it for profit			0
" we are desperate to ensure that the rescue center is not closed down and relocated , " said @entity59 , the founder and chief executive of @entity13			0
the charity says it has invested $ 2 million of donors ' money in the bear rehabilitation center , which will be lost if the centre closes			0
@entity68 said it would also cost 77 local people their jobs , and added : " the welfare of 104 bears , who have already suffered enough , would be seriously compromised			0
" now she and @entity76 are pinning their hopes for a reprieve on an appeal to @entity4 prime minister @entity81			1
they say he can override the eviction ruling , and are urging him to honor the original agreement to set land aside as a home for bears			0
@entity8 this week joined the campaign to stop the sanctuary from being shut , tweeting to his 4.9 million followers : " stop 104 rescued bears losing their home ! email @entity4 's pm to save @entity13 's sanctuary # stoptheeviction "			1
the government of @entity4 has so far not responded to @entity0 's requests for comment .			2
