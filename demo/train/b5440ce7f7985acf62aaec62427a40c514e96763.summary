-- a four - minute video lampooning your image as an international statesman is not the ideal start to a foreign tour			0
but this week , @entity8 's increasingly unpopular prime minister @entity7 will put an unflattering viral video behind him as he embarks on a 10 - day trip to @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity15 as the clip , from @entity18 's " @entity17 , " spread through social media , the show tweeted : " @entity8 is a continent divided ! after last night 's episode , they are unable to decide between hashtags # @entity23 and # @entity25			1
" the most recent opinion polls back up the sentiment			1
according to @entity30 surveys commissioned by the @entity8 newspaper , @entity7 's approval rating has slipped to 33 % , down from his highest ever rating of 45 % in november last year			1
mending ties with @entity12 @entity7 's foreign tour starts in @entity12 wednesday when he meets president @entity35 on the @entity12 island of @entity37			1
it will be their face - to - face meeting in six months , following a period of frosty relations between the two countries			0
relations soured last november amid allegations that @entity8 intelligence agencies phone - tapped @entity12 's leader , his wife and close allies			1
@entity12 immediately recalled its ambassador , who has only recently returned to his post			0
" the clear indication from @entity35 is that he wants this thing to end on good terms as he completes his presidency of 10 years , " @entity50 , a lecturer in @entity51 at the @entity52 told @entity0			0
@entity57 will step down after two terms in office , when the country votes for a new leader in july			0
" he 's clearly been known to be a friend of @entity8 ... and he 's prided himself on his international statesman image			0
certainly as he comes to the end of his reign that will be how he will be wanting his legacy to be reflected , because domestically he 's been rating very poorly in the polls , " @entity50 said			0
@entity7 has made it clear too he wants to mend ties , on tuesday brushing aside revelations that @entity12 journalists were in the room listening to an ostensibly private phone conversation between @entity7 and @entity35 last month			1
asked by the @entity76 's @entity75 whether he knew journalists were listening , @entity7 said , " the important thing is the quality of the conversation			0
" describing the call as " very genial , " @entity7 said " there is no doubt that president @entity35 is and will always be , i think , a great friend of @entity8			1
" a transcript of the phone call was published on an @entity12 website in early may			2
a partial transcript published by the @entity76 on tuesday revealed a seemingly innocuous conversation about when they 'd next meet			0
voter discontent @entity7 's problems at home center on a deeply unpopular budget the government has been struggling to sell since it was announced two weeks ago			2
described as the worst - received federal budget in more than 20 years , it raised taxes , cut benefits , increased university fees and imposed a new fee for medical visits			0
@entity7 maintains the budget is a painful but necessary remedy to years of overspending by the former @entity107 government			2
however , critics accuse him of breaking pre-election promises and imposing spending cuts that unfairly target the poor			0
tough asylum policy one of @entity7 's main pre-election policies was a tougher stance on asylum seekers who arrive in @entity8 waters by boat			1
as well as a continuation of offshore processing , the @entity119 leader advocated a " turn - back " policy ; approval for the @entity8 navy to force boats in @entity8 waters to turn around " when it is safe to do so			2
" the policy rankled @entity12 , especially after a @entity129 by @entity8 authorities found @entity8 vessels " inadvertently " strayed into @entity12 waters six times between december 2013 and january 2014			1
" the @entity12 government has i think quite fairly been arguing for some time that there needs to be regional cooperation on the issue of asylum seekers and indeed the stop the boats policy was seen as a unilateral action , " @entity50 said			1
during the eight months it has been in power , @entity7 's government has succeeded in drastically reducing the number of boats arriving in @entity8			1
the prime minister told the @entity76 the government 's policies had removed a " source of friction " with @entity12 -- " because none of them are making it to @entity8 , very few of them are leaving @entity12 shores			2
the whole point of leaving @entity12 is to get to @entity8 and if you never get to @entity8 , why bother leaving @entity12 ? " after the phone tapping controversy , @entity12 called for a " code of conduct " to be agreed before relations return to normal			1
however it 's unlikely it will be announced this week as the document is still being drafted			0
beyond @entity12 after @entity12 , @entity7 is due to attend the official d - day commemorations in @entity13 on june 6 , before traveling to @entity14 for talks with prime minister @entity164 , then the @entity15 where he 'll meet president @entity165			1
@entity166 will dominate talks there as @entity7 attempts to attract foreign investment with the mantra that @entity8 is " once again open for business			2
" @entity7 has acknowledged his government faces a " very , very big job " at home convincing voters that the measures announced in the budget will eventually pay off			0
the upcoming series of high - profile meetings is @entity7 's opportunity to redefine early perceptions of his premiership , and deflect the conversation away from a choice of unflattering hashtags .			0

relationship soured over phone tapping allegations and asylum seeker policy
