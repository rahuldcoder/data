@entity0 it was the most - watched tv show in the world -- and it was a sexist mess			1
that 's what @entity7 activists are saying in a petition issued this week that calls for the cancellation of @entity7 's annual @entity11 , a state tv extravaganza viewed last wednesday by 690 million people -- but filled with grating skits mocking women and other minority groups			1
one sketch depicted an overweight woman in her late - 20s complaining about being unmarried			1
the punchline ? her brothers bring out a tall , slim female " goddess " to help their less attractive sister understand why she 's still single			2
" i 've got big eyes , small mouth , a high nose , long legs ... i 'm pretty and a bunch of guys are chasing me that give me ' face ' , " chants the taller woman			0
" i do n't have breasts and a bunch of guys are chasing me to do arm wrestling , " replies the shorter one			0
then , in unison , the duo cheerfully exclaim their respective identities : " female goddess and manly woman ! " in another act , a father jokes about selling his daughter for 30 yuan ( $ 4.80 )			0
another skit mocks a " female cadre , " implying that she 's used sexual favors to advance her career			2
other parts of the show rag on southern @entity7 people as well as dwarfs			1
in a society where women still face significant challenges â€” from discrimination against girls to extreme pressure on women to marry early -- many watchers found the performance nauseating			2
a widely - circulated petition called the show " poisonous " and demanded it to be taken off air			1
" in the name of ' harmony ' it erases the rights of people to live differently			0
it complacently slanders not just women ... but all people , as long as you are eager to think critically and make decisions out of your free will , " it said			2
the petition racked up thousands of signatures , many of them by self - described feminists , before it was removed from the @entity82			1
( @entity1 was able to access a cached version			0
) but some posts by feminists remained uncensored on @entity85 , @entity7 's public social media platform			1
" comparing ' manly women ' and ' goddesses , ' unmarried and unemployed women ... what qualifications do you have to discuss these topics ? " one highly - rated comment fumed at the show 's producers			1
" why do n't you discuss male losers ? the fact that these skits were shown on the @entity11 is truly a national humiliation			0
" the same writer added : " we 're not proposing that women rule over everything			0
we just want awareness of how women are discriminated against everywhere , and we want change			0
" @entity1 's @entity106 contributed reporting .			0
