@entity2 authorities are not required to release any internal @entity4 communications it had with @entity6 giant @entity5 after a 2010 cyber attack in @entity8 , a federal appeals court ruled friday			1
at issue was a @entity11 request from a private group over the suspected collaborative relationship between the public and private entities			0
the @entity4 said disclosure of any communications -- even with outside companies -- would threaten government information systems			1
the agency had given the @entity21 a so - called " @entity26 " response , in which the government refuses to confirm or deny the existence of any requested records			2
@entity21 , a privacy and civil liberties group , made the @entity11 submission weeks after the january 2010 cyberattack on @entity30 accounts , primarily targeting @entity8 human rights activists			2
@entity5 quickly changed its server encryption protocols following the digital attacks , and a top company official publicly stated its engineers were " also working with the relevant @entity2 authorities			1
" a federal judge eventually sided with the @entity4 and @entity5 , and the three - judge federal panel has now affirmed			1
" the existence of a relationship or communications between the @entity4 and any private company certainly constitutes an ' activity ' of the agency subject to protection " from public disclosure , said judge @entity39			1
" moreover , if private entities knew that any of their attempts to reach out to @entity4 could be made public through a @entity11 request , they might hesitate or decline to contact the agency , thereby hindering its information assurance mission			1
" @entity39 was backed by judges @entity54 and @entity55 , all named to the bench by @entity59 presidents			0
the court noted past precedent giving the government leeway in deciding which information it wishes to share with the public			1
" in reviewing an agency 's @entity26 response , this court exercises caution when the information requested implicates national security , a uniquely executive purview , " said @entity39			2
" @entity4 need not make a specific showing of potential harm to national security in order to justify withholding information			1
" the @entity77 precedent refers to a 1970s incident , where the @entity79 refused to discuss a ship under its control , allegedly used to secretly salvage a @entity83 submarine which had sunk			0
@entity21 now has the option of asking the @entity85 to hear its free - speech appeal			0
the group says despite friday 's legal setback , it has several other similar , pending lawsuits against the agency			0
lawyers from @entity21 had argued the collaboration between @entity5 and the federal agency -- which conducts global electronic surveillance -- was widely reported in the national media			1
the private group said the agency thus had a responsibility to locate records that could be disclosed			0
" the military 's top officer warned last year of the " substantial " and complex threat to the @entity2 from foreign cyberattack			2
" we 've got to come to a place where those threats are diminished , if not eliminated , " then - @entity104 chairman adm. @entity103 said in january 2011			1
" i would never go in , certainly in any area of warfare , into details on threats except to say they are substantial			0
we are focused on them			0
" @entity103 , who retired last fall , said that cyberspace is a lawless terrain			0
" the threat from @entity8 is significant , " @entity103 said			2
" there are other threats out there that we see routinely			0
... it is an enormously complex and critical area that all of us need to understand a lot better and do a lot more about			0
" the case is @entity21 v. @entity4 ( 11 - 5233 ) .			2

federal appeals court affirms protection of communications between @entity5 and @entity4
@entity4 said disclosure would threaten government information systems
