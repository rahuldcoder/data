-- here 's the reality of the situation : a diplomatic solution to @entity5 's use of chemical weapons will include " boots on the ground			1
" the threat of a military solution will not			1
it should come as no surprise that anything other than doing nothing in @entity5 will be costly and threatens the deployment of soldiers to @entity5 to ensure compliance			1
but why does diplomacy seem so enticing ? let 's assume @entity20 agrees to surrender his chemical stockpiles to an international body for control or destruction			2
what next ? minimally , there has to be a cease - fire in @entity5 's civil war			1
there can be no inspection regime until all parties involved in the fighting in @entity5 agree to stop fighting and to an intrusive cease - fire verification regime			2
having led the initial weapons of mass destruction hunt in @entity36 in 2003 , i can tell you that there is no possibility that inspectors should volunteer to race into harm 's way to inspect a possible chemical site without a phalanx of soldiers protecting them			1
is a cease - fire likely ? no side is incentivized to stop fighting			0
the minority @entity48 are running @entity5 as well as for their lives			2
@entity51 has stoked this war by proxy ; it has no interest in a cessation of hostilities			2
@entity57 is guided and funded by @entity51 so it wo n't stop the killing			0
@entity59 has supported @entity20 and his family for decades			0
it is unlikely that @entity59 will cut off its aid , especially in light of president @entity65 's lecture to @entity66 in the form of an op - ed in thursday 's @entity69			0
as a starting point , @entity5 has to declare what chemical weapons it has and where they 're located before any inspectors secured by soldiers step onto @entity5 soil			1
@entity77 will surrender that data on his chemical stockpiles , but it may well be wrong , full of intentional inaccuracies			0
every vault behind every door within every site must be verified			0
the amount of time to accomplish that task will be years			0
let 's not forget , a cease - fire must remain in place and be resilient enough to withstand the inevitable score - settling of this bloody civil war			1
only the bravest of the brave inspectors will agree to this mission			0
will the chemical weapons , or the other possible weapons of mass destruction that inspectors discover , be destroyed in place , or will they be taken out of country for destruction or safeguarding ? the answer seems quite simple -- destroy them in place			1
the logistics just to arrive at the point of finding the munitions are staggering			0
to upload arguably unstable munitions from multiple disparate locations throughout @entity5 and transport them along poorly maintained roads to locations within @entity5 to be secured or destroyed in a nonpermissive environment when hostilities are likely to flare up any time is a monumental task			1
let 's hope decisions about " rendering safe " are made by weapons experts , not suits			2
finally , every party involved in @entity5 's civil war wants @entity20 's chemical stockpile			1
chemical weapons are strategic leverage			1
@entity57 and @entity128 insurgents are already deciding how to threaten their regional enemies and each other with the use of chemicals			0
be careful what you ask for			0

military *analyst* says people should not *underestimate* the demands of a diplomatic solution
he says inspecting , destroying @entity5 's chemical weapons would require " boots on the ground "
*inserting* troops and inspectors into the *middle* of a raging civil war is a *daunting* task , he says
