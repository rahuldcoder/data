-- many radiologists rely on specialized computer software to pinpoint suspicious areas in routine mammograms			1
but in a large new study , the technology failed to improve breast cancer detection and also increased a woman 's risk of being told she had an abnormal mammogram when she was , in fact , cancer free			2
the study analyzed 1.6 million mammograms taken at 90 radiology facilities in seven states between 1998 and 2006			1
the findings , which appear online in the " @entity18 , " extend and confirm the results of a controversial 2007 study from the same research team that cast doubt on the value of the technology , known as computer - aided detection , or @entity26			1
" women should probably understand that @entity26 is probably being used to interpret their mammogram and that it 's probably not helping detect breast cancer earlier , " says @entity27 , @entity28 , the lead author of both studies and an assistant professor of family and community medicine at the @entity33 , in @entity34			1
@entity0 : simple things that could cut your breast cancer risk routine annual mammograms are widely recommended for women 40 and older			0
the breast x-rays can detect cancer at an early stage , when it 's most treatable , but they are n't perfect ; they miss up to 20 % of breast cancers , according to the @entity50			0
having two radiologists interpret a mammogram has been shown to improve the detection rate			0
in recent years , studies have found cad software -- which scans mammogram images and highlights areas that may require a closer look -- to be just as effective in detecting cancers as a second pair of eyes			0
@entity62 , @entity28 , chair of the radiology department at @entity64 , in @entity65 , says that in light of the new evidence , radiologists should use more discretion in interpreting @entity26 results			1
" is it a legitimate pair of eyes ? is it really doing the job that the radiologists want it to do ? " @entity0 : celebrities who battled breast cancer the @entity79 approved the first cad software in 1998 , after a series of small clinical studies found that @entity26 could boost breast cancer detection without causing an unacceptable number of false - positives , cases in which doctors mistakenly identify benign abnormalities as cancerous			1
@entity26 is now used in roughly three of every four screening mammograms , according to a 2010 analysis of @entity92 data published in the " journal of the @entity94			2
" @entity92 pays doctors an additional $ 12 per mammogram for @entity26 over and above the reimbursement for the mammogram itself , which ranges from about $ 80 ( for conventional film - screen mammograms ) to $ 130 ( for newer digital mammograms )			2
in the new study , which included more than 680,000 women , the researchers examined film mammograms because too few digital mammograms were conducted during the study period to allow a thorough analysis			2
( breast x-rays produced on film must be converted to digital images before they can be analyzed by the computer software			0
) the detection rate for noninvasive breast abnormalities improved at radiology facilities that adopted cad technology , but , crucially , the rate did not improve for invasive breast cancers , the dangerous type that invade healthy tissue in the breast or other parts of the body			1
@entity0 : understanding your breast cancer diagnosis moreover , in facilities that began using cad the percentage of women with abnormal mammograms who were accurately diagnosed ( a measure known as " positive predictive value " ) dropped , from 4.3 % to 3.6 %			0
rates of false - positives and " recalls " -- being called back for further testing -- increased slightly after facilities implemented cad			0
however , the biopsy rate declined over time regardless of whether @entity26 was used			0
in a similar study published in the " @entity140 " in 2007 , @entity27 and his colleagues reported that @entity26 reduced the accuracy of mammograms and led to a higher rate of false - positives			1
@entity0 : how to help a loved one cope with breast cancer the new investigation shared the same overall design , but the researchers addressed criticisms directed at the earlier study by including a larger number of @entity26 screens and by excluding mammograms interpreted in the first three months after a facility adopted @entity26 , when radiologists were becoming accustomed to using the technology			1
despite these improvements , it 's still unclear from the new study whether individual radiologists used @entity26 correctly , or even whether they used it at all , says @entity161 , @entity28 , chair of the @entity163 , and a @entity165 - based breast - imaging specialist			1
" it makes me think that we as a medical community need to further evaluate the use of @entity26 , " says @entity166 , who does not use @entity26 in her own practice			0
" but i do n't know that just based on this study that we should abandon this technology			0
" @entity0 : 25 breast cancer myths the @entity174 , an @entity175 , @entity176 , - based trade association that represents medical imaging developers and manufacturers , said in a prepared statement that other recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of @entity26			0
women should have access to the " right scan at the right time , " the association said , whether it 's mammography with @entity26 or another imaging technique			2
in an editorial accompanying @entity27 's study , @entity191 , @entity192 , chair of the department of biostatistics at @entity195 , in @entity196 , says economic incentives -- including the use of @entity26 as a defense in malpractice suits -- " may stoke its continued proliferation			1
" researchers and device companies should work to make the software better , but in an experimental setting and not while exposing millions of women to a technology that may do more harm than good , @entity191 writes			0

the study analyzed 1.6 million mammograms taken at 90 radiology facilities
the new evidence *suggests* radiologists should use more discretion in interpreting results
it 's still unclear from the new study whether individual radiologists used @entity26 correctly
