@entity5 was acquitted of child molestation charges in 2005 , partly based on the testimony of @entity8 , his sister and his mother			2
" it 's absurd , " said @entity39 , the lawyer who successfully defended @entity5 in the trial			1
" he was one of the strongest witnesses for the defense at @entity5 's criminal trial in 2005			1
he was adamant under oath that he had never been molested at any time			0
" a housekeeper at @entity5 's @entity48 testified that she saw @entity5 showering naked with @entity8 during a visit in the early 1990s , but he denied it at the trial			1

" i just had a wonderful relationship , " he said			0
" i learned so much from him , as an artist and as a kind human being , and it 's my goal to just try and continue as much as i can in my own little world that legacy			0
" " we talk so much about him as the pop legend , which is important , but it 's nice to remember that he was a man , that he was a father , " @entity8 said			2
" and that 's what it 's really about is a father and his children , and he was a wonderful dad			0
" the 2005 trial in @entity83 , @entity84 , centered on charges that @entity5 had molested a 13 - year - old cancer survivor who often visited his ranch			1

" mr. @entity8 's claim is outrageous and pathetic , " @entity5 estate lawyer @entity103 said in a prepared statement			1
" this is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that @entity5 never did anything inappropriate to him or with him			0
now , nearly four years after @entity5 has passed this sad and less than credible claim has been made			0
we are confident that the court will see this for what it is			0
" @entity39 said it was " suspicious timing " for the claim to be filed at the start of the trial of the @entity5 wrongful death case , in which @entity5 's mother and children are suing concert promoter @entity124			1
