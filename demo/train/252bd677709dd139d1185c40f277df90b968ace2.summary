-- much has been said about @entity1 in the weeks leading up to her wedding , and now the reality star is speaking for herself			1
the 33 - year - old opened up wednesday on topics ranging from the truth about her wedding dress to racism			1
for starters , she posted may 7 , she and fiance @entity10 are n't married yet , despite speculation earlier in the week that the two had secured a marriage license			1
they 're also not going to film their upcoming nuptials for @entity17 's " keeping up with the @entity18			0
" " you will see everything leading up til and after ! " @entity1 tweeted			1
" as much as we would love to share these memories on camera , we 've decided to keep this close to our heart & share thru photos			0
" there 's also been chatter about who will and wo n't be coming to the @entity31 wedding -- people magazine has indicated that the @entity1 family will be there , but not @entity31 's pals @entity35 and @entity37 -- while others have gossiped about the details of @entity1 's wedding dress			1
yet according to the reality star , her fans should n't believe a word " unless you hear it from us			1
" " no guest list has been released			0
seeing fake ones , " she tweeted			0
" especially not 1600 people invited like i just read			0
( the wedding is ) very small & intimate			2
" and for that matter , she 's seen " fake wedding dress pics of me			2
no one has seen my dress ! those photos are old or photoshopped			0
" after @entity1 got those wedding - related thoughts off her chest , she turned to a more serious matter : how being a mother of a mixed - race child has affected her understanding of racism			1

" " it 's amazing how one little person and the love i have for her has brought new meaning to every moment			0
what once seemed so important , now feels insignificant , " she writes			0
" to be honest , before i had @entity66 , i never really gave racism or discrimination a lot of thought			0
it is obviously a topic that @entity10 is passionate about , but i guess it was easier for me to believe that it was someone else 's battle			1
" but with the arrival of her daughter , @entity1 says she 's more aware " of a side of life that is n't always so pretty			2
" " i feel a responsibility as a mother , a public figure , a human being , to do what i can to make sure that not only my child , but all children , do n't have to grow up in a world where they are judged by the color of their skin , or their gender , or their sexual orientation , " @entity1 concluded			2
