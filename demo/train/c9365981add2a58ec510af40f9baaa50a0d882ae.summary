president @entity0 signed an executive order monday banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity			1
despite calls from religious leaders , faith - based groups will not be exempt			1
" thanks to your passion and advocacy and the irrefutable rightness of your cause , our government -- a government of the people , by the people and for the people -- will become just a little bit fairer , " @entity0 said			0
gay federal workers are already protected from workplace discrimination by a @entity25 - era order and @entity0 's action extended the protections to shield workers from gender identity - based discrimination			0
@entity31 , which joined a coalition of nearly 100 civil rights and @entity35 groups urging @entity0 to reject calls for a religious exemption , thanked him for taking action			1
it said he made the " right call " for not tagging any religious exemptions to the document			0
" faith - based groups that tap the public purse should play by the same rules as everyone else and not expect special treatment , " the group 's executive director , rev. @entity43 , said in a statement			2
" no forms of discrimination should be supported with the taxpayer dime , period			0
" @entity54 , executive director of the @entity55 , was in the room as @entity0 signed the order and said it was an emotional moment			0
" there are now millions of @entity35 people and their families who are just going to sleep a little bit easier tonight knowing that they ca n't be fired from their jobs as federal contractors , " she said			2
during the ceremony , which comes 50 years after president @entity67 signed the @entity68 , @entity0 also recalled the history of executive actions and legislation to ban discrimination in the workplace and " make sure we the people applies to all the people			0
" @entity75 passes @entity35 anti-discrimination bill but @entity0 's signature on monday did not touch a 2002 executive order signed by president @entity80 that allows religious groups to weigh prospective employees ' faith in hiring decisions			1
this gave some opponents of the order hope that they could continue to consider sexual orientation in hiring decisions			1
one of those opponents , @entity91 , director of the @entity92 at @entity93 , said he was disappointed by @entity0 's decision regarding the religious exemption			1
but he suggested that religious groups could still rely on the 2002 order			1
" i believe the administration has left open a path that religious groups can work with , " @entity91 said			1
@entity101 , president of the @entity102 of the @entity103 , had stronger words for @entity0 and worried that the @entity80 - era executive order would leave out some faith - based groups			1
" while we do n't know the full implications of this executive order , i am disappointed that this administration persistently violates the freedom of conscience for religious organizations that provide necessary relief for the poor and endangered , " @entity101 said			1
" the ones hurt will be the most vulnerable in our society			0
" @entity0 's executive action extends protections against sexual - based discrimination to employees of federal contractors operating outside of the 21 states and the @entity123 that enacted their own non-discrimination legislation			2
@entity0 also noted that a majority of @entity128 companies have policies in place against discrimination based on sexual orientation			0
the action is not the first time @entity0 has used his presidential powers to benefit the lgbt community			0
in 2010 , he signed an order extending benefits to same - sex partners of executive branch employees already provided to opposite - sex partners			2
but on the federal legislative level , @entity35 groups have struggled to enact similar legislation			2
the @entity75 passed a bill barring @entity35 discrimination in the fall			0
but the measure , which exempted religious groups from the would - be - law , did not make it to the @entity153 floor where @entity154 opposed it			1
and attendees greeted @entity0 's call to continue applying pressure to " resolve this problem once and for all " with one resounding word : " @entity161			0
" @entity162 rules against @entity0 in contraception case			0
