-- it 's not gardening the way most know it -- the people sifting through air plants , succulents and clumps of moss , often between glasses of wine			2
but terrarium gardens and other tiny plant projects are popping up at home , in classes and parties			1
it 's a @entity17 © cor trend that 's partly about plants , and partly about getting personal			1
the small , easy - to - care - for gardens have shown up in home design magazines , and on the shelves of craft , @entity17 © cor and nursery stores			1
they create scenes on a shelf , or hang in clusters from the ceiling , softening corners			2
as the @entity32 crowd continues to experiment with the form , they 're being made into pendants and earrings or built into miniature containers , like light bulbs and snail shells			1
some are even crafting terrariums to commemorate personal experiences			1
share your style ! it could be @entity46 's @entity45 " i see them with their tweezers , pushing the plants into the moss and making everything just so			2
it 's like a little @entity62 zen garden , " said @entity54 , owner of @entity55 , inside the @entity58 home goods dealer @entity56 on @entity59			1
she sells terrariums and teaches monthly terrarium - building classes			1
" terrariums are a way of bringing the outdoors in , and i think we all need that			1
we need some grounding influence in our lives			2
" we 're never unplugged now			0
so maybe what we 're looking for is that little bit of sanctuary , that little bit of peace			0
" @entity58 designer and architect @entity76 said terrariums are popular right now as an antidote to rigid , architectural spaces			1
they provide an organic texture and color that designers love to work with , as well as create an interesting vignette in a room			1
" instead of putting a palm or a ficus in a corner , it 's something you can install on a wall , in a series of containers on a grid , essentially what is a living wall , " he said			0
but the harmony of terrariums in the home all comes back to texture and scale , @entity76 said			1
the plants themselves are gorgeous when you get up close , he said , but take a step back to appreciate the size , shape and color of succulents coming together			0
" we love tightly compact clusters of succulents , " @entity76 said of his design company			0
" they 're so different , not something we as @entity116 natives have grown up with			0
" aquarium - style terrariums had a moment in the 1970s , but these days , there 's an emphasis on fantasy , found objects and the creator 's personality			1
terrariums can be sparse and minimalist or multi-media			1
some adopt @entity62 forms , such as kokedama and @entity131 , or serve as a reminder of the owner 's travels			0
generally , all anyone really needs to make a terrarium is a vessel , a plant and a substrate for the plant to grow in			1
" we 've seen an increase in terrarium building for about two years now , " said @entity141 , a @entity142 associate and @entity144 - certified nursery professional			1
in terrariums , people use any plant that survives well in enclosed areas , including succulents , air plants -- plants that receive their nutrients from the air -- palms and begonias			1
" there 's a big variety now because the growers saw that it was doing really well , " she said			0
take @entity0 's @entity164 quiz @entity165 has been a popular part of the trend , too			0
its dense texture creates visual interest on a small scale , and it keeps plants moist like mulch would for an outdoor garden			2
some moss can be used like a painter might blend colors on a canvas , @entity54 said			0
" reindeer moss , especially , is dyed in reds and greens and turquoise , " said @entity179 's @entity54			0
" when you tear it apart , it has this delicate , coral - like structure that is really beautiful in small spaces			2
" sheet moss is a great option for wrapping small plant projects , like begonia balls			1
they 're a @entity195 take on kokedama , an ancient @entity62 hanging garden technique			0
@entity54 and her partner @entity198 took begonias out of their pots , wrapped the dirt in moss and then wrapped string around the ball of dirt			0
" it 's quiet greenery , " she said			0
" it does n't get wild , it does n't overgrow			0
" but as hobbyists are learning to make their own , they 're as much about personal tastes and experiences as how they look in a room			2
" the terrarium you make today is most likely not be the same as the terrarium you make five years from now			0
and that 's a good thing because you 're changing as an individual , " @entity54 said			0
" terrariums are representative of you			2
these are little metaphors for you , for a place you 've been or a place you want to go			0
" it 's not just a fern in a pot. " what 's your tiny plant project ? share an image with us on @entity234 or on @entity235 .			2
