in a telephone interview with @entity9 's " @entity11 , " @entity3 admitted that some details in the graphic 23 - page grand jury report released earlier this month are correct			1
" i could say i have done some of those things , " he said			0
" i have horsed around with kids i have showered ( with ) after workouts			1
i have hugged them , and i have touched their legs without intent of sexual contact			0
" still , @entity3 claimed he has been falsely accused of crimes			1
when pressed , the 67 - year - old @entity3 said the only thing he did wrong was having " showered with those kids			1

i obviously played a part in this ... i should n't have showered with those kids			1
that 's what hits me the most			2

he 's a jock , " @entity43 told @entity2 's @entity46			1

" they have throwing everything they can throw up against the wall , " @entity43 said of prosecutors ' case			0
" and they 're saying , ( out of ) all these accusations , some of them have to be true			0
but when you take it apart , they do n't even have victims in several of their cases			0
