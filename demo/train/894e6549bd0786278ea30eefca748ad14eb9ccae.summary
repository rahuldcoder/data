-- @entity3 's @entity2 champions hope that world no. 1 @entity4 will be able to play in friday 's opening rubber of the semifinal against @entity7 in @entity8			1
the 24 - year - old arrived in his home city on thursday following his epic four - hour @entity12 final victory over @entity13 in @entity14 on monday			1
he has been drawn to play @entity15 , but his teammates are prepared for the possibility that history will repeat itself in the tennis teams event			1
last year @entity4 also played in a monday final at @entity21 , that time losing to @entity13 , and pulled out of his opening singles against the @entity23 after falling ill. " we 'll see how he feels , " said @entity24 , who clinched the decisive rubber in last december 's final against @entity27			1
" if he 's not that great , i 'll be definitely ready to play the first match against @entity15			0
" last year i found out three hours before the match that i would play , but this time i 'm aware that he might not play if he 's not right			0
" @entity15 , who lost to @entity13 in the third round at the @entity12 , has been struggling with injuries this year but holds a 3 - 1 career record over @entity24			2
the former world @entity37 , now ranked 74th , is 1 - 4 against @entity4 -- who has won 64 of 66 matches this year			2
" @entity15 has been a main feature for @entity7 in @entity2 for the last few years , he 's a real cup player , " @entity7 captain @entity39 told the tournament 's website			2
" he 's been trying quite hard to come back on the circuit			0
he played an excellent first set against @entity13 in the @entity12 , and he 's a player who 's capable of beating anybody , so that 's why we chose him			0
" the second singles rubber sees @entity3 no. 2 @entity50 take on former world no. 4 @entity51 , the @entity52 champion who is resurrecting his career after a year out with wrist problems			2
@entity50 and @entity55 were drawn to face @entity56 and @entity57 in saturday 's doubles tie , but that line - up could yet change depending on friday 's results			0
in the second semifinal , last year 's runners - up @entity27 travel to @entity63 to play @entity13 's @entity65 on his favored clay surface			1
the @entity27 won 5 - 0 in his absence last year , but may struggle without injured world @entity68 @entity70 -- their best clay player			0
@entity13 will play @entity72 in the opening rubber , then @entity74 will take over as @entity27 's no. 1 against @entity76			1
@entity13 has beaten 15th - ranked @entity72 in all nine professional encounters , while world no. 11 @entity74 's only win over @entity76 came on @entity80 's hard - courts this year after two clay defeats in 2007			1
" i know exactly what he 's going to do , " @entity74 said of his fifth - ranked opponent			0
" he 's a real warrior on the court , but i know that i can win and i have to keep believing that every moment			0
" in the doubles , @entity86 and @entity87 will play @entity27 's @entity89 and world no. 10 @entity90 , who has struggled on clay this year but may be given a chance in the reverse singles .			1

@entity4 drawn to play @entity15 in opening tie of @entity2 semifinal
