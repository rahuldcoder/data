the @entity4 college exam will undergo sweeping changes on what 's tested , how it 's scored and how students can prepare , @entity1 president and ceo @entity0 said wednesday			1
standardized tests have become " far too disconnected from the work of our high schools , " @entity0 said at an event in @entity13 , @entity14			2
they 're too stressful for students , too filled with mystery and " tricks " to raise scores and are n't necessarily creating more college - ready students , he said			2
the sat to be released in spring 2016 is designed to change that , he said			1
the test will include three sections -- evidence - based reading and writing , math and an optional essay -- each retooled to stop students from simply filling a bubble on the test sheet			2
" no longer will it be good enough to focus on tricks and trying to eliminate answer choices , " @entity0 said			0
" we are not interested in students just picking an answer , but justifying their answers			2
" the test will shift from its current score scale of 2400 back to 1600 , with a separate score for the essay			1
no longer will test takers be penalized for choosing incorrect answers			2
to prepare students for the test , the @entity1 will partner for the first time with @entity47 to provide free test preparation materials , starting in spring 2015			1
afterward , income - eligible students will receive fee waivers to apply to four colleges for free			2
why the test is changing the last major changes to the sat came in 2005 , when it altered some question formats , added a written essay and changed its score scale from 1600 to 2400			1
for this change , @entity0 cited the need to create more opportunities for students , rather than obstructing them with test questions that felt detached from their educations and the preparation colleges needed			1
@entity0 , who joined the @entity1 in 2012 , has spoken critically of his organization 's test and discussed how it could be improved			1
" admissions officers and counselors have said they find the data from admissions exams useful , but are concerned that these exams have become disconnected from the work of high school classrooms and surrounded by costly test preparation , " @entity0 said			1
in recent years , another exam , the @entity80 , has gained popularity as several states adopted it as part of their standardized testing programs			0
and while the majority of four - year colleges require an exam score for admission , hundreds of schools have shifted to test - optional policies that allow students to decide what to submit -- or whether to share a test score at all			2
indeed , students ' grades and the academic rigor of their courses weighs more heavily in college admissions decision than standardized test scores , class rank or professed interest in a particular school , according to the @entity104 's 2013 " @entity105 " report released in january			1
the report was based on surveys sent to public and private high schools , postsecondary institutions and data from the @entity1 , the @entity112 @entity111 and the @entity113			1
" i 'd like to be optimistic and believe some of this is going to be good , " said @entity114 , a member of the @entity104 board and dean of admissions emeritus for @entity118 in @entity119 , @entity120 -- a test - optional school			2
" i just do n't know how it will work out			0
" @entity114 was part of @entity104 's @entity125 that in 2008 urged standardized test makers to adhere more closely to school curricula , colleges to consider more about applicants than seductively simple test scores and society to stop rating schools based on standardized test scores			1
@entity114 was intrigued by the @entity47 partnership , he said , and pleased with the direction @entity0 seemed to be taking the test			1
he wonders whether fee waivers and others changes are meant to draw back students and schools that have turned away from the sat or testing in general			0
until he sees the passages students will be reading , the questions they 're answering and the way colleges react , he has to remain skeptical			0
" some of this is just words			0
they had a lot of great language around the last change , " in 2005 , @entity114 said			0
" the angst about the exams has just continued to grow			0
" how the test will change sections of the redesigned @entity4 might sound similar to the current test , but the changes are significant , @entity0 said			1
the reading and writing sections will include questions that require students to cite evidence for their answer choices , and will include reading passages from a broader range of disciplines , including science , history , social studies and literature			0
test takers will no longer be asked to complete sentences with obscure words they might have memorized from flash cards			0
instead , students will have to consider the context of how words like " synthesis " and " empirical " are used			0
they 're not " sat words " as they 've come to be known , @entity0 said , but words students are likely to encounter again			0
" we must do all we can to foster this daily work that prepares students , " @entity0 said			0
the math section will no longer allow calculators to be used on every portion			0
it will focus on data analysis and real world problem - solving , algebra and some more advanced math concepts -- areas that most prepare students for college and career , @entity0 said			0
" it is not that helpful to tell students , ' to get ready , they should study all of math , ' " @entity0 said			0
the essay , which the @entity4 added in 2005 , will now be optional			1
@entity4 essays have faced criticism over the years from educators who said they focused too much on what test takers wrote , not whether their statements were true , or their arguments reasonable			1
@entity0 said the @entity1 would now take responsibility for " unintended consequences " of how the essay test was designed			1
essays will be scored separately from the rest of the test , and the prompt will remain basically the same in every test : it will ask students to consider a passage and write an essay that analyzes how the author made an argument , used evidence and styled ideas			2
the redesigned test will take about three hours , with an additional 50 minutes for the essay , and will be administered by print and computer ; the current test is available on paper only			0
how students can prepare last year , when @entity0 announced plans to redesign the sat , he said it would launch in 2015			0
toward the end of 2013 , he delayed the launch to 2016 in order to allow partners more time to prepare			0
that means more time for students , educators and guidance and admissions counselors to understand the changes -- and more time for the @entity1 's @entity47 test prep program to gear up			1
partnering with the free , online resource is intended to make the @entity4 more transparent , and cut back on perceptions of inequality around expensive test preparation services , @entity0 explained wednesday			1
" if there are no more secrets , " @entity0 said , " it 's very hard to pay for them			0
" students ' classrooms are meant to be the best preparation for the redesigned sat. @entity1 's @entity47 tools will supplement that learning			1
" it 's going to meet students where they are , " said @entity261 , the @entity47 creator			1
" we 'll take you as far back as you need to go or as far forward as you need to go			0
" @entity261 emphasized that he is planning to challenge the existing test prep industry by offering high quality , easily accessible tools			2
" this is n't just a ' hey , since it 's free , it 's better than nothing , " he said			2
" our intention in this partnership is this will be the best thing out there , and it happens to be free			0
" on april 16 , the @entity1 will release more detailed specifications about the test and sample test questions			1
some @entity47 tools will be available to help students taking the sat before the redesigned exam launches , @entity0 said			2
for students , @entity0 said , " we hope you breathe a sigh of relief that this exam will be focused , useful , open , clear , and aligned with the work you will do throughout high school			1
