having helped to plan my fair share of international conferences and summits , i know a real success when i see it			0
and the @entity8 's summit on countering violence and extremism this week was n't one			1
as an exercise in focusing on the homegrown aspects of countering extremism and facilitating better communication among religious , educational , community leaders and law enforcement , this week 's three - day meeting had merit			1
but if the purpose of the summit was to craft a strategy -- even a political one -- to help defeat the @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 ( @entity27 ) , then its impact is likely to prove very limited indeed			1
that goal -- if it can be accomplished at all -- will only be realized by demonstrating that @entity27 ca n't expand the territory under its control and govern effectively in the territory it currently controls			1
and that will require a long war and a sustainable military and political strategy involving local and regional allies			0
of course , it is understandable why the summit was called -- the @entity42 administration 's failure to send a high - level representative to @entity44 in the wake of the @entity47 terror attacks was widely criticized ; and the summit had been postponed once before			2
it was , therefore , particularly important that the president demonstrate leadership in the fight against extremism			1
and it has to be said that convening a meeting of some 60 nations is no small achievement			0
indeed , perhaps the most useful contribution of gathering so many officials together was that it will aid coordination of domestic efforts on how to preempt homegrown radicalism among young people			0
in that sense , the president was right to refer to the challenge as generational , something @entity65 @entity64 have been active and alert to even before the summit began			2
but the summit also highlighted the limitations , contradictions and flaws in the approach the administration has embraced			2
the president went to great lengths to offer a strategic view of how to combat @entity27 that focused on the importance of changing the way states in the region govern themselves			1
" when people are oppressed and human rights are denied , particularly along sectarian lines or ethnic lines , when dissent is silenced , it feeds violent extremism , " he said			2
there 's no doubt that bad governance -- or even no governance -- has enabled the rise and success of @entity27			1
but the suggestion that democracy is an antidote to radical @entity100 only shines a light on some of @entity65 's key allies in the fight against @entity27 , including the monarchies and sheikhdoms of the @entity107 @entity106 , such as @entity108 , @entity109 , and states such as @entity111 and @entity112			1
none could be described as anything close to a democracy , and none have any intention of undertaking serious reforms to become one			0
in fact , if the president wants to preserve his @entity122 @entity107 coalition against @entity27 , he 'll have to do the opposite of what he 's suggesting -- not push these countries to serious reform			1
because if he does , they wo n't cooperate with him			0
this contradiction leads to a second problem -- the idea that a summit in @entity133 , or indeed anything made in @entity65 , will somehow lead to an effective counter narrative that will halt @entity27 success at recruitment			1
the reality is that the @entity65 has been particularly ill - suited to capturing the hearts and minds of @entity107 and @entity64 youth , partly because of our policies in @entity25 and @entity144 , but also our support for authoritarian regimes , our drone strikes and our support for @entity149			0
we may not actually have the problem in the right sequence			0
instead of hearts and minds , it should be minds and hearts			0
first , you appeal to people on the basis of their interests , and then the emotional component follows			0
many of the governments in the region lacking political inclusiveness and employment opportunities ca n't do this			0
and if their own governments ca n't provide a compelling alternative to the @entity27 religious vision of some kind of @entity100 caliphate , then how can the @entity65 be expected to ? there may be many reasons why @entity27 succeeds in attracting followers -- personal frustration , alienated lives , a perverted fascination with violence and terror , a sense of identity and belonging			1
the question , then , is how do you craft a compelling counter vision for young people in the region or aggrieved @entity187 muslims other than to say hammer @entity27 's depravity ? and when you do that , you simply reinforce conspiracies about the @entity191 and supposed plots against @entity100			1
neither democratic reform in the @entity107 world ( highly unlikely ) , nor counter-messaging ( probably ineffective ) , will check the rise of @entity27			1
that can be achieved only by a military and political strategy designed to demonstrate that @entity27 has failed			1
and that means containing and reversing the group 's gains through the use of air power , standing up local allies , marshaling a @entity122 @entity107 coalition , and most likely by deploying additional @entity206			0
there are many constraints inherent in this approach			0
@entity212 - backed @entity211 militias feed @entity27 recruitment by killing @entity122			1
and @entity215 's regime in @entity26 does the same			0
meanwhile , ungoverned spaces in @entity217 and @entity218 offer new opportunities for @entity221 affiliates			0
but stopping @entity27 gains and rolling them back in @entity25 and over time in @entity26 are critical , and would be the best counter-narrative possible			2
the legitimacy of @entity27 , @entity224 argues in a must - read piece in the @entity227 , depends on its ability to control territory -- its putative caliphate			2
in fact , that 's what gives @entity27 leader @entity234 his legitimacy			2
@entity236 that back in @entity25 and bleeding @entity27 in @entity26 is the only way to demonstrate that the group has failed to deliver			2
all this underscores that we are in a long war , and one that will include some tough choices -- including how to deal with @entity215 , @entity212 ambitions in @entity25 , non-democratic allies , and the deployment of additional @entity65 forces on the ground			2
right now , however , this is the best approach we have			0
hold another summit and try hearts and minds if you must			0
but the fight against @entity27 will be won on the ground by showing the world that this quasi-state that aspires to re-create an 8th century , violent form of @entity100 rule will not succeed in the 21st .			1
