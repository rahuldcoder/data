@entity0 -- the @entity2 passed the @entity4 version of the @entity5 on wednesday , despite strong opposition from @entity7			1
the @entity4 version , passed 222 - 205 , offers a stark contrast from the bill passed by the @entity11 in late april , which will lead to further political fighting as both chambers attempt to work out a compromise over the law 's reauthorization			1
wednesday 's vote fell largely along party lines , though 23 @entity4 voted against their own party and opposed the bill			2
meanwhile , six @entity7 defected and voted in favor of the @entity4 version			1
the @entity5 was first enacted in 1994			2
it has been reauthorized twice since then with bipartisan support and very little controversy			0
that 's not the case this time around			0
the @entity11 approved a bill last month with bipartisan support , voting 68 - 31 with every @entity4 woman supporting the measure			1
that version expands coverage to offer services to more illegal immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse			1
it also specifies that the law include gay , lesbian and transgender victims			0
@entity41 released a report wednesday showing immigrant farmworkers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the @entity11 bill -- not the @entity2 version -- " would go some way toward fixing the problem and should be enacted			1
" @entity2 @entity4 oppose those changes , saying they are unnecessary because the law already covers all victims , and instead favor a narrower version of renewing the law			1
rep. @entity54 of @entity55 , the no. 2 @entity56 , opposed the @entity4 bill and has been calling for a vote on the @entity11 measure			1
" all victims of domestic violence , irrespective of gender , ought to be protected , " @entity54 said			0
" we believe the protection ought to be comprehensive , and we do n't believe the @entity4 ' bill does that			2
" he joined a number of @entity2 @entity7 who urged their colleagues to vote against the bill prior to the floor vote on wednesday			2
the @entity72 late tuesday threatened to veto the @entity2 @entity4 bill , in part because it " fails to include language that would prohibit discrimination against @entity78 victims			1
" the veto threat also says the @entity4 proposals " senselessly remove existing legal protections " and " jeopardize victims by placing them directly in harm 's way			2
" " today we are now debating something else that i never thought that we would be debating , which is whether or not all victims should be protected or just some , " said sen. @entity85 , @entity86 , in a press conference wednesday			0
" and we stand strongly together in saying that every single victim of domestic violence should have the law on their side			2
vice president @entity96 reacted to wednesday 's vote by saying the @entity2 - passed version of the bill " will roll back critical provisions to help victims of abuse			1
" @entity2 @entity4 leaders , meanwhile , accused @entity7 of creating a phony fight for political gain			2
" this is another one of the @entity111 gimmicks that goes on around here , " house speaker @entity106 , @entity107 , said at a recent news conference			0
" this is an important issue , but for our friends to be playing political games with this , frankly , is very inappropriate			0
" @entity117 , a first - term representative from @entity118 who rode the @entity4 wave in the 2010 midterm elections , agreed			1
" i want to reauthorize it ; i do not want to politicize it			0
the victims deserve better than that			0
@entity125 deserve better than that			0
" after the vote , @entity117 said , " make no mistake about it ; this is a victim - centered bill that is all inclusive			1
just like past reauthorizations , the @entity2 - passed legislation is focused on all victims , without regard for race , ethnicity , sexual preference , or nationality			2
@entity2 @entity4 presented @entity117 as their new messenger this week in their fight to combat " @entity142 , " one of the harshest election - year attack lines congressional democrats have launched at @entity4			1
they accuse the @entity4 of waging this war on issues ranging from contraception to preventive health care coverage			2
" i 'm pretty sure i 'm not at war with myself , " said @entity117			0
she has maintained a relatively low profile during her time in @entity152			0
but she stepped into the spotlight in a big way -- becoming the @entity4 face of the latest battle on @entity157 over the @entity5 , bringing her own story of domestic abuse with her			1
" at an early age , i quit high school at 17 and joined the @entity162			0
married by 18 , " @entity117 said			0
" during the marriage , i had a little girl , and i realized really soon that my husband had a penchant for drinking , and when he drank , he turned very mean , very violent			0
" she took her daughter and left			0
she later found work as a law enforcement officer before winning a seat in the @entity172 and eventually running for the @entity2			1
" i have experienced it both on a personal level and a law enforcement level , " @entity117 said			1
" i know how this law has helped so many people in our country			0
" her personal story may have helped @entity4 push their version of the 18 - year - old law and also help deflect the continued @entity7 criticism that @entity4 are insensitive toward women			2
while @entity117 condemns politics playing a role in this latest congressional standoff , being at the center of it does n't help someone like her , who is facing some tough politics herself -- she is up against a much higher - profile fellow @entity4 , rep. @entity195 , in an upcoming primary in @entity118			1
now that the @entity2 has passed the @entity4 version of the bill , it will need to reconcile differences with the @entity11 over its bill			1
both sides agree on the end goal : to renew the law			0
but in an election year , the lingering question is : how long will @entity152 drag out this fight ? @entity1 's @entity208 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity2 passes the @entity4 version of the @entity5 222 - 205
@entity118 rep. @entity117 is the face of @entity4 effort
@entity117 was victim of domestic abuse and a law enforcement officer
@entity11 version of bill expands provisions for illegal immigrants ; @entity2 version does n't
