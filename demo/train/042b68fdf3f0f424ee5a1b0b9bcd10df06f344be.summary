@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's brutal conflict between regime and rebel forces is creeping closer and closer to nervous residents in the areas of @entity0 still under government control			1
but in some suburbs of the capital , all - out war is already here			1
snipers swap shots around the clock in @entity15 , a district in southern @entity0			1
the front line here has been static for months now , but fighting has increased recently as the government has won back neighboring districts and opposition fighters have fled to this area			1
" it is pretty much every day that they try to attack our positions			0
it happens in the mornings , the afternoons , the evenings and at night			0
when we see them , we shoot , " one @entity1 soldier told @entity2 , never taking his eyes off the battle - scarred swath of @entity34 visible through his sniper scope			1
the battle for the suburbs of @entity0 will be key to deciding the outcome of the civil war in @entity1			1
much of the southern and eastern ring around the capital has fallen into the hands of rebel forces , often led by @entity47 brigades , but the @entity1 army is slowly winning back turf -- often at a high cost for both sides			1
the front line in @entity15 has gone back and forth between the rebels and the military for a long time			1
the commander in charge , who would only let us identify him as @entity58 , took us through a street that runs parallel to the front			0
" we call this the lifeline , " he said			0
" we used this street to move around and resupply when the rebels nearly broke through			2
it was vital to holding on to this area			0
" most of the residents have fled the buildings near the front line , but only a few yards away life continues at almost a normal pace			0
children play in the streets , shops are open and cars edge along debris - littered streets			0
" we had to leave our houses a few times because the fighting came so close , " one local woman said			0
" but the military was able to hold the opposition fighters up and things have become more calm recently			0
" @entity1 president @entity85 has made winning back the outskirts of @entity0 a main priority			1
while @entity1 soldiers in @entity15 are merely holding the line , in other districts , the army is on the offensive			2
regime forces recently won back the district of @entity95 south of the capital and have also made gains in @entity98 , the district just west of @entity15			1
@entity58 , the commander in charge of taking back @entity15 , says there are many foreign jihadists among the rebels his forces have encountered			1
" the fighters from foreign countries are leaders , " @entity58 said , " especially from places like @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110			0
we hear from our sources inside that there are many foreign fighters there			0
" one opposition leader in the @entity117 region around @entity0 who calls himself @entity119 called the army 's siege of rebel - held areas " genocidal			1
" " we are facing a severe shortage of medicine and all medical supplies , " @entity119 told @entity2			0
" they are basically non-existent			0
we have gone back to the stone age			1
" rebels say the @entity85 regime is trying to starve the civilians still stuck in contested areas			1
there have been reports and videos on social media of severely malnourished children and people eating leaves to survive			0
a photo that surfaced on @entity141 in the past week allegedly shows residents of one @entity0 subrub killing the lion at the local zoo for food			2
but the government claims the opposition is keeping aid convoys from reaching the districts under siege			1
international aid groups have blamed both sides of using access to food as a weapon			2
when asked what @entity1 's military was fighting for , @entity58 , the commander in @entity15 , insisted it was about more than simply preserving @entity85 's rule			2
" this is not a battle of good against evil , " he said			2
" this is the battle of a secular state against @entity47 ideals			0
we want to preserve @entity1 as a diverse society			2
" the soldiers in @entity15 say they are placing little hope in the @entity1 peace talks scheduled to take place in @entity172 , @entity173 next january			2
right now they ca n't see beyond the mostly deserted streets of a neighborhood that both sides are reducing to rubble .			0
