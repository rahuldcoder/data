-- the @entity2 administration may very well be right that the attack in @entity4 which claimed the lives of ambassador @entity6 and three other @entity8 officials was part of a pre-planned terrorist operation			1
it would have happened sooner or later regardless of any protests against an obscure @entity14 film made in @entity8			2
the attack apparently occurred because in recent days , the @entity17 leader @entity16 posted a video online calling on @entity19 to avenge the killing of @entity17 's second in command , @entity23			1
according to our own sources at @entity27 , the attack was the work of roughly 20 militants prepared for a military assault			0
it is rare , for example , that an @entity33 -- an anti-tank rocket - propelled grenade launcher -- would be present at a civilian protest			0
the attack against the consulate had two waves			2
the first attack led to @entity8 officials being evacuated from the consulate by @entity19 security forces , only for the second wave to be launched against @entity8 officials after they were kept at a secure location			1
news : how the @entity4 attack unfolded jihadists will want the world to believe that the attack is just a part of the protests against an amateur film produced in the @entity8 , which includes crude insults regarding the @entity54			1
they will want the world to think that their actions represent a popular @entity19 and wider @entity59 reaction ; thus , reversing the perception of jihadists being outcasts from their own societies			1
since there were similar protests in @entity67 against the film , it is possible that more protests may erupt in muslim - majority countries such as @entity71 and @entity72			0
the jihadists may also feel that by killing @entity8 citizens , they will win the support of local populations			2
this attack was committed by a small group of extremists who do not represent the @entity19 population			1
they seek to destroy any reconstruction attempts in my mother country			0
as often is the case , extremists try to take advantage of the absence of security in a country that has just gotten out of a civil war			0
they try so hard to destabilize the peace that the majority of the population have fought so hard to establish			0
ambassador @entity6 himself was well known for advocating peace and stability in @entity19			2
the recent election results in the country are testament to his conviction that @entity19 can achieve progress			2
that @entity19 did not vote the radicals into office in the elections proves that @entity19 is not a nation of extremists			0
the extremists ' response to their electoral defeat comes in a language they relish : violence			0
opinion : will @entity67 's leaders calm or fan the crisis ? the attack on the @entity8 consulate is a truly tragic event			1
@entity19 has lost one of the few foreign figures that really sought to invest time and energy into our country and believed in its future			0
ambassador @entity6 was one of a select number of international public figures based in @entity19 , who had refused to give up on @entity19 and its deteriorating security situation in recent months			1
he was an extremely successful envoy , who traveled the country to meet with all groups of @entity19 society , and did not confine himself to international circles in the capital			1
no village or town was too far , and he was always keen to understand local customs			0
his death is a loss not just for @entity8 , but for many @entity19			1
i hope that the @entity19 government will take this time to reflect on the security vacuum in the country , in particular around @entity4 , and rebuild the defense and security sectors in an accountable , professional and responsible manner			0
i also hope that @entity19 authorities will look to revise their policy of disarmament , demobilization and reintegration ( @entity153 ) so that the situation on the ground can be improved			0
opinion : @entity19 killings show @entity8 at risk in @entity160 world we have welcomed the international community into our country , and i know that we want to continue our collaboration with the @entity166 community and member states , including , and especially , with the @entity8			1
these countries helped free us from the tyrannical rule of colonel @entity170 , who was in power for 42 years			0
many @entity19 are forever grateful to @entity8 for its support in freeing our country from dictatorship			1
this attack does not reflect the attitude of the @entity19 population			2
for the international community , withdrawal of support from @entity19 will only play directly into the hands of jihadists , and that is the opposite of what we should do			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity8 consulate in @entity19 was attacked ; some thought it was because of a video
@entity188 : the attack was most likely a pre-planned terrorist operation
he says attack does not represent views of most @entity19 , who are grateful to @entity8
@entity188 : the international community must not give up on @entity19 's reconstruction
