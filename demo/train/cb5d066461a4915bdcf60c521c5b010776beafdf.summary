@entity0 , @entity1 -- sitting beside the aging railway tracks running deeper into the forest of @entity1 , we waited outside the frail wooden hut that was used as a makeshift railway station			1
@entity8 rumbled ominously in the distance but there was no timetable so we had to sit and wait			0
after a few hours , the railway tracks began to vibrate with the sound of an on - coming train and the small band of passengers stood and looked down the tracks expectantly			1
coming into sight , rolling slowly down the tracks , was the @entity19 , or what is called locally -- " @entity21			2
" it is a small wooden frame , running on ball - bearings and pushed by both the ' @entity26 " operators and passengers down the tracks to get to its destination			1
two operators and a passenger , holding tightly to the wooden frame of what looks more like a cart , ran alongside and pushed the train			1
the tracks were visible through the floor and as we passed through the occasional village people would wave			0
on the slight declines , the " @entity26 " would gain it 's own momentum and the young men pushing would jump onboard and enjoy the ride			1
" a lot of people , especially those with heavy commodities like charcoal , use these to take them to the market , " explained one passenger , @entity44			0
" it 's cheap to transport and it 's faster			2
" the journey from the end of the railway line to @entity1 's capital @entity57 can take up to 36hours by " @entity26 " -- only a 3hour journey by road - but it costs half the price			1
however , more importantly , the railway line passes through villages that have little access by road			0
" this helps our people in the village , " said another passenger , @entity65			0
" if they get sick , we can put them in and quickly take them to hospital			0
" " @entity26 " started in the 1990 's during @entity1 's 14 - year civil war that left the country 's infrastructure in ruins			1
but it 's hard work			1
" you get tired , so you have to rest for five minutes and then you get more power and can push again hard , " said @entity80 , one of the operators			2
" but it 's tiring and makes my muscles sore			0
" but the train can not roll faster than the storm clouds that gather overhead and another of " @entity26 's " disadvantages quickly becomes apparent as we quickly get soaked in the rain			2
we get off at the next station to find cover but the young men continue to push the train down the tracks -- a long journey ahead and plenty of obstacles , but they 're determined to make it anyway they can .			0

@entity1 has a unique transport *system* - the " @entity26 " train
officially known as the @entity19 , it is a wooden train pushed by operators and passengers
while the " @entity26 " is cheap and *environmentally* *friendly* , pushing the train is hard work
