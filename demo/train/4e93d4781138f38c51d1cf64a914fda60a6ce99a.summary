-- @entity2 's upset win over rep. @entity3 in the @entity5 primary is also another major victory for the @entity7 and for @entity8			1
" i also want to thank the @entity7 , " said @entity2 in her victory speech tuesday night			1
the @entity7 , a leading @entity10 organization , endorsed @entity2 on july 21 and spent more than $ 250,000 to help the once long shot candidate defeat @entity3 , a brand name in @entity14 thanks to two terms as governor and the past 18 years as the statewide congressman			1
@entity2 's victory comes two weeks after sen. @entity19 conceded to @entity20 in @entity23 's @entity22 primary			1
the @entity7 pumped in about $ 600,000 to help the once unknown @entity20 edge out @entity19 , part of a political dynasty in @entity23			2
@entity7 is one of the most recognized national @entity10 organizations , thanks to its three high - profile bus caravans and rallies			2
the group , based in @entity32 , @entity33 , has also become a major player in @entity36 politics , spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads for @entity36 @entity5 candidate @entity39 in @entity40 , who in january upset democrat @entity41 in a special election to fill the late sen. @entity44 's seat			1
more recently , the organization helped the little - known @entity46 win the @entity36 primary in @entity48 , endorsing her and spending about a half - million dollars on ads. @entity51 now faces off in the general election against senate majority leader @entity53 , the top @entity41 in the chamber			0
@entity7 , along with other @entity10 groups and other conservative organizations , also targeted incumbent @entity36 sen. @entity57 in @entity58 for his vote on the @entity60 and helped defeat his bid for a fourth term			2
@entity7 then backed underdog @entity65 's successful primary campaign in @entity58 and @entity65 now is heavily favored to win the general election in november and join the @entity5 next year			1
the group also endorsed @entity68 in @entity69			0
the son of former @entity22 presidential hopeful and @entity73 rep. @entity72 topped @entity69 secretary of state @entity74 , the establishment @entity36 candidate , in the state 's @entity5 primary			1
they also endorsed @entity78 in @entity79			0
the former @entity79 @entity81 speaker , once a long shot to win the @entity36 @entity5 nomination , is now the party 's nominee			1
the onetime front - runner , gov. @entity87 , dropped his bid for the @entity22 nomination and is running for the @entity5 as an independent candidate			1
among its rare statewide defeats : the @entity7 backed state lawmaker @entity93 in @entity33 's @entity5 primary			1
it also supported rep. @entity97 in @entity98			0
fellow @entity99 rep. @entity99 beat @entity97 in the primary			0
so what 's the secret to the @entity7 ' success ? " they have cut right to the chase			2
they have a very uncomplicated message that resonates with voters who think @entity110 's problems are quite simple and quite obvious : we 're spending too much money , government is too big and we ca n't trust career politicians to fix these problems			0
and voters are indicating they would much rather try something or someone new instead of sticking with the status quo or the safe pick , " said @entity36 strategist @entity116			0
but not all the news for the @entity7 has been positive			2
earlier this summer , the @entity123 , which seeks to represent the @entity10 political movement around the country , expelled the @entity7 because of an inflammatory blog post that one of its leaders , @entity129 , wrote responding to criticism of the @entity10 movement from the @entity132			2
the story made national headlines and @entity129 later stepped down as spokesman for @entity7			0
@entity2 's victory is also a big win for @entity8			1
" thank you @entity8 for your endorsement , " said @entity2			1
" she got behind us war - weary folks and gave us a boost of encouragement when we needed it			0
" on september 9 , the former @entity23 governor and the 2008 @entity36 vice presidential nominee endorsed @entity2			0
one day before the primary , a recording of @entity8 urging @entity147 to vote for @entity2 was blasted to voters by robo - calls across the state			1
many statewide candidates that @entity8 has endorsed have done well in this year 's @entity36 primaries			1
@entity23 's @entity20 was one of three @entity8 - backed statewide candidates running in the august 24 primaries who went on to victory			2
she also endorsed @entity160 sen. @entity159 , the former presidential candidate who rocketed @entity8 to stardom in 2008 when he selected her as his running mate			2
though members of the @entity10 movement lined up against the longtime @entity160 senator , @entity8 stayed loyal to @entity159 and appeared at a campaign event with him in march			0
addressing long - standing concern among conservatives @entity159 is too centrist , @entity8 said the @entity160 senator is driven by " common - sense conservative principles " and touted his steadfast opposition to the @entity173 administration			0
@entity159 beat former rep. @entity174 by more than 30 points			0
in the race for @entity79 attorney general , @entity8 backed @entity178 , a @entity179 prosecutor who faced the better - known lt. gov. @entity180 for the job			0
@entity8 's endorsement of @entity183 came about a week before the vote and even surprised @entity178 , who had no notice @entity8 would take to her @entity187 page to back the campaign			1
@entity178 came out on top in a three - candidate field			0
in august , several @entity8 - endorsed candidates suffered losses in statewide @entity36 primaries			2
she backed @entity10 activist and former @entity196 player @entity194 , who was easily defeated by @entity197 for the @entity5 nomination in @entity110			0
@entity200 state auditor @entity199 , who had @entity8 's backing , narrowly lost her bid for the @entity22 gubernatorial nomination			1
@entity8 campaigned in person with former @entity206 secretary of state @entity205 , who lost a runoff to former rep. @entity208 for the state 's @entity36 nomination for governor			0
@entity8 also endorsed @entity7 - backed @entity97 , who was defeated in the battle for the @entity5 nomination in @entity98			1
earlier in the primary season , @entity8 successfully backed statewide candidates such as @entity216 in @entity217 , @entity218 in @entity219 and @entity220 in @entity221 , who all won gubernatorial nominations , and @entity95 in @entity33 and @entity72 in @entity69 , who captured @entity5 nominations			1
@entity0 's @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
