-- @entity1 is taking steps to defend itself against threatened retaliation from @entity5 after claims it launched a night assault on a suburb of the capital @entity11 on sunday			1
this was believed to be the second @entity1 attack in three days			2
the country positioned rocket interception batteries along its northern border and closed northern airspace to civil aviation after @entity5 vowed it would " suffer " for the alleged airstrikes on what it called a " scientific research facility			1
" @entity1 declined to comment on reported attacks			2
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity26 , @entity5 's deputy foreign minister @entity24 called the alleged assault a " declaration of war			1
" meanwhile , condemnation flowed from its allies , including @entity31 , which said the " vicious acts " could " jeopardize ( the ) security of the entire region			0
" what do we know about the extent of @entity1 's intervention ? we know what 's being claimed by @entity5 , and that is that several explosions hit the scientific research center in @entity44 early sunday , killing 42 @entity5 soldiers , the opposition @entity39 said monday , citing medical sources			1
it said 100 people remained missing			0
@entity5 's state news agency , @entity48 , said early information indicated the explosions were caused by @entity1 rockets , though @entity1 has a policy or refusing to comment on attacks attributed to its military			1
it 's not the first time @entity1 has targeted the site , @entity48 reported , pointing to an attack on january 30			2
at the time , a @entity60 official told @entity0 the claim was false , saying that @entity1 fighter jets targeted a @entity5 government convoy carrying surface - to - air missiles bound for the militant group @entity65 in @entity66			1
@entity5 denied there were such shipments			2
last week , two @entity60 officials backed up @entity5 claims that @entity1 had launched airstrikes in the country on thursday or friday , taking the total number of potential strikes within @entity5 territory to three , including sunday 's alleged attack			1
on sunday , the @entity77 and @entity78 -- the @entity78 -- intensified their patrols along @entity66 's border with @entity1 , according to @entity66 's national news agency			0
it said the move followed the alleged blasts and " intensified @entity1 @entity77 patrols " along the " ' @entity86 ' within the occupied territories			1
" @entity89 security - general @entity88 has urged all sides to exercise " maximum calm and restraint			0
" however , @entity88 's spokesman said in a statement issued on sunday that the @entity89 could not " independently verify what has occurred			0
" is @entity1 saying anything ? @entity1 's long - standing policy has been to deny comment on claims of attacks			1
however , it has previously said that it would target any transfer of weapons to @entity65 or other terrorist groups , as well as any effort to smuggle @entity5 weapons into @entity66 that could threaten @entity1			1
@entity107 , a lawmaker in @entity1 's @entity108 or parliament , told @entity110 on sunday that @entity1 was n't meddling in @entity5 's civil war			1
but he insisted that @entity1 must protect itself from @entity66 militants			0
" for @entity1 , it is very important that the front group for @entity31 , which is in @entity66 , needs to be stopped , " @entity107 said			0
" @entity65 is deeply involved up to its neck in what is happening in @entity5 , " @entity107 said , before adding " @entity65 helps the @entity117 navigate against the rebels			0
" how is @entity65 involved , and what is its connection to @entity31 ? the supply of weapons by @entity31 to @entity65 in @entity66 is thought to be at the heart of the issue			0
@entity31 has long supported @entity65 with funding and weapons , which it 's alleged are smuggled via @entity5 to the organization 's @entity66 base			1
after sunday 's strike , @entity31 's foreign minister phoned his counterpart in @entity5 and " praised the resistance by the @entity5 government against the enemies ' plots			0
" @entity65 is a @entity136 militant group regarded by @entity1 and the @entity60 as a terrorist organization , although its political wing is a key player in @entity66 's government			0
it has been linked to a number of attacks against @entity1 , @entity60 and other @entity144 targets			0
in 2006 , @entity1 and @entity65 fought a month - long war in @entity66 , northern @entity1 and the @entity146 which ended with a @entity89 - brokered cease - fire			1
at the time , @entity1 was said to be surprised by the intensity and weaponry displayed by the @entity65 forces			0
@entity1 says it has intelligence that @entity65 has long been supported by the @entity5 government and @entity65 has in turn been supporting the @entity5 regime throughout the country 's civil war			1
@entity65 has been accused of sending fighters into @entity5 to support the @entity158 regime in the south and south west , but has denied these claims , saying its militants have , only recently , begun defending @entity66 border villages from attack by @entity5 rebels			2
in 2009 , the top @entity60 diplomat in @entity11 disclosed that @entity5 had begun delivery of ballistic missiles to @entity65 , according to official cables leaked to and published by @entity169			1
how real are fears that this could lead to a regional @entity173 war ? few sides at this point would logically appreciate a widening of the conflict -- but hopes of resolving it seem as distant as ever			1
" the @entity5 struggle has not only spread into @entity5 's neighbors , like @entity66 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 -- but has also become a battlefield wherein @entity1 and @entity31 are challenging each other , " @entity180 , professor of international relations at the @entity182 , wrote in an opinion piece for @entity0			1
" there is also a fierce geostrategic rivalry unfolding in @entity5 between @entity194 - dominant @entity193 and @entity31 , a rivalry invested and fuelled with sectarianism			0
a real danger exists that this complex conflict in @entity5 could escalate into a region - wide battle involving @entity5 's major allies -- @entity31 and @entity65 , and @entity1 , other regional powers , and the @entity144 states			1
" analysts say that as part of the @entity66 government the group would be risking a great deal if it responded to @entity1 aggression with force			0
@entity1 officials are betting that @entity158 will not retaliate , both because his forces have their hands full already and because any strike against @entity1 would risk @entity1 counterstrikes that might seriously degrade his advantages in the civil war , like airpower			2
" they do n't want to open a new front that might be the last one they open , " says one @entity1 military official on condition of anonymity			2
" they would suffer a knockout punch			0
" @entity5 's military is exhausted by the civil war and it would make little sense to open a new front against the best equipped military in the region , unless it was in a last - ditch attempt to garner flagging support as its internal morale vanished			2
but two years into the @entity5 civil war there does not seem to be a military solution			2
" it is a long war of attrition with no end in sight , " wrote @entity180			0
" neither internal camp seems to have the means to deliver a decisive blow			0
" only a political solution will put an end to the shedding of @entity5 blood and prevent the unthinkable : a region - wide conflict that would have catastrophic consequences			2
" @entity252 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 takes steps to defend itself after claims it launched an assault on @entity11
in exclusive interview with @entity0 , @entity5 official called alleged assault " declaration of war "
few would logically appreciate widening of conflict , but hopes of resolving it seem distant
