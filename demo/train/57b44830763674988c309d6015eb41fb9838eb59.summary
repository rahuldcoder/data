-- a man arrested in connection with the 1990 abduction , rape and attempted murder of an 8 - year - old girl appeared before a judge thursday on an attempted capital murder charge , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity9			1
@entity11 , a 40 - year - old welder , was arrested after @entity12 tied him to the crime , police say			1
@entity11 waived his right to a court - appointed attorney when he appeared thursday , saying he would retain his own			1
for security reasons , the hearing was held at the @entity20 ( @entity21 ) @entity22 and not in a courtroom , the station reported			1
the judge ordered @entity11 to undergo a physical and mental evaluation and set bail at $ 1 million			1
his next court appearance was set for wednesday , according to @entity9			2
upon conviction , an attempted capital murder charge could result in a sentence of life in prison			1
@entity11 , a 40 - year - old welder , was arrested early tuesday in @entity33 , @entity34 , in connection with the 1990 incident involving @entity37 , who was abducted from her bedroom , raped and left for dead in @entity39 , @entity21			1
@entity37 shared her story with @entity0 two weeks ago in hope of someday bringing her attacker to justice			2
@entity0 normally does not identify victims of sexual assault , but @entity37 decided to go public with her story to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker			2
" it 's not about me anymore , " she told @entity0 in september			1
" it 's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night			1
i know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt			0
you have to fight back			0
" @entity11 's arrest came after dna and other forensic tests led police to him , authorities said			1
" this is a huge day for me , " @entity37 told @entity0 on tuesday			0
" and i want to see this through the end			1
the rest will come out during the trial			0
" @entity37 said she was alone in her bed august 10 , 1990 , when a man crept in through a window			0
she remembers waking up in a stranger 's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot			1
she said he told her he was an undercover cop and knew her family			0
he drove her through the streets of @entity39 , pulling into a mechanic 's shop next to her elementary school			1
the moon will change colors , and that is when your mom will come to get you , " she recalled him saying			0
" oh , it looks like she is not coming			0
" @entity37 said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and sexually assaulted her			0
when she regained consciousness , she was lying naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear and her voice box torn			0
she was found at 6 p.m. on a hot august day after lying in the field for nearly 12 hours			1
she was rushed to a hospital in critical condition			0
" three days after the attack , i started giving a description			0
the doctors told me i would never be able to talk again , but i proved them all wrong , " @entity37 said			0
she believes that she got her voice back so she could tell her story			0
@entity103 @entity102 special agent @entity101 is one of the lead investigators in the case , along with @entity39 police detective @entity106			1
both men were discussing the case when @entity101 received a memo from the @entity102 's @entity110 ( @entity112 ) team , seeking child abduction cases that had gone cold and could be retested for dna evidence			1
@entity37 's was one of the cases selected			2
" this is the only one that i can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived , " @entity101 said			2
" the main reason the card team picked this case was because she was alive			0
in cases of child abduction , it is rare that the child is recovered alive			2
frequently , you recover a body			0
and most times , you never find them			0
" the investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago , which was retested			2
it included the underwear and pajamas @entity37 was wearing , as well as a man 's underwear and t - shirt , which were found in the field where @entity37 was found			1
the clothes were tested in 1990 , but the sample was n't large enough for conclusive results			0
but now , modern techniques allow @entity12 to be isolated from a single human cell			1
they were still awaiting the results when @entity0 featured @entity37 's story in late september			2
@entity0 's @entity146 contributed to this report .			2
