-- it 's the kind of thing that seems to happen every day to innocent grandmas , teens and toddlers when they pass through the airport : @entity7 , a 16 - year - old type 1 diabetic , uses an insulin pump that can malfunction when exposed to technology used in airport screenings			0
when she passed through the @entity13 airport for a flight home to @entity15 in may , she asked for a pat - down , but @entity18 workers directed her to pass through a scanner			1
her parents were n't there -- she was on a school trip -- but she trusted @entity18 agents to guide her			1
but the pump makers could no longer guarantee that @entity25 was receiving the correct amount of insulin after it passed through the scanner , and it had to be replaced			0
@entity25 's story became another milestone in travelers ' collective loathing , annoyance and exasperation with the 50,000 - person agency charged with protecting the nation 's transportation systems			0
travel industry watchers say the mood toward the @entity18 is n't at its worst right now , but it 's at risk of getting there			1
ten years since the agency 's creation -- and nearly 11 since the last major act of terrorism aboard a @entity48 plane -- travelers still detest the @entity18			1
while the @entity18 does n't count grumbles as fliers remove their shoes or leave behind oversized shampoo bottles , the number of complaints received by phone or e-mail has decreased , according to @entity18 data			1
the numbers this year are lower than in recent years past : 1,294 complaints total in march , the most recent month for which data are available			2
that 's down from a peak of 4,027 in may 2004 , the highest number since the @entity18 began to track and release complaint data eight years ago			1
perhaps the most maligned parts of @entity18 security often get the lowest number of complaints			1
screening procedures drew 1,960 complaints since january 2010 , and security checkpoint processing time got 2,484 complaints since then			1
travelers ' stuff , it turns out , is the source of most complaints			2
since the start of 2010 , the highest number of complaints -- 18,196 -- related to damage claims for checked bags , problems for which airlines and the @entity18 share liability			1
( it 's also the area that experienced the biggest decreases in recent complaint tallies			0
) in second place , at 10,187 , were complaints about treatment of personal property at security checkpoints			1
the mood toward the @entity18 is n't good , but it was worse in late 2010 , when the @entity18 began to deploy full - body scanners and pat - downs in airports , said @entity103 's ombudsman and consumer advocate , @entity105			1
back then , some declared " we wo n't fly " or rallied behind the idea of @entity108 , which called for passengers to request pat - downs instead of going through the scanners on the busiest travel day of the year			0
( in the end , @entity108 did n't disturb lines			0
) that november , a @entity116 / @entity115 poll found that 57 % of adult fliers were bothered or angered by security pat - downs , while 42 % felt that way about full - body scans			2
the outrage spawned a social media - fed genre of viral videos and stories about poorly handled @entity18 scans -- like @entity7 's -- and grope - y pat - downs			1
fliers were n't happy then , @entity105 said , and he thinks the tension is bubbling again			1
" people trust them until something happens , until they get a screener that makes them take their pants off or frisks them in a way they think is too invasive , " he said			0
the @entity18 is " under pressure from @entity138 to do more with less			1
there are questions about the safety of the body scanners			0
there have been numerous misunderstandings between passengers and the ( screeners )			0
all those things add up			0
" air rage : passengers ' quicker to snap ' unofficial complaints about the @entity18 go way beyond frustration over wrapped holiday gifts and suspicious baked goods			1
critics say it 's ineffective , inconsistent and unconstitutional ; that it 's not actually making travelers safer and creates a false sense of security ; that its officers are poorly trained , its equipment unsafe and its methods embarrassing			2
in may , an inspector general 's report said the @entity18 was n't adequately tracking or fixing airport security breaches			1
new this week , some complain it costs fliers too much			0
after 10 years with a security fee of $ 2.50 for passengers , the @entity18 wants to offset rising costs by boosting it to $ 5 for each leg of a trip			1
@entity18 officials said they 're trying to help their relationship with travelers by clearing up security do 's and don'ts in a mobile app and allowing some direct contact through " @entity184			1
the agency wants to shorten waits and reduce invasive security checks by expanding @entity188 , a program that puts passengers who share more personal information on a fast - track through security screenings ; it will be in 35 of the country 's largest airports by the end of the year			2
for now , users are mostly frequent fliers invited to join , but the @entity18 said @entity188 will open up to military personnel , kids and people ages 75 and older			1
airline squeeze : it 's not you , ' it 's the seat ' but does the @entity18 need to win any government agency popularity contests ? does it make a difference if its customers do n't like it or if they trust it at all ? a difficult relationship with travelers might mean the @entity18 misses out on useful observations that could be shared by roughly 50 million passengers who pass through airport checkpoints every month			1
@entity215 law enforcement has successfully relied on people 's observations and ingrained the idea in the public through the @entity221 's now - familiar slogan , " if you see something , say something			0
" the @entity225 launched its own ad campaign with the slogan last year , although it was n't aimed specifically at customers who come into contact with the @entity18			1
" the @entity18 had never really gotten the kind of traction we needed with our customers , " former @entity18 administrator @entity230 wrote in his book , " permanent emergency : inside the @entity18 and the @entity237 , " published in april			2
" gaining the willful participation and support of the public would give us access to the largest and most dynamic network out there			0
" security technologist @entity244 said he 's not aware of data that link security to the relationship between the agency and its customers -- but it 's a good question			1
" i believe the @entity18 is having a credibility problem , " he said			1
" if you hate something , you 're going to have a worse time doing it			2
if people do n't trust something and hate it , then it goes less well			0
" a study published in @entity258 last year found that passengers in the @entity260 had a higher opinion of whole - body scanners after they were presented with unbiased information about them , including risks and sample images			0
they found them fast and less intrusive than pat - downs			0
not informing passengers about scanners can open the door to misinformation and critics , the study 's authors said , and hurt the long - term acceptance and legitimacy of airport security			2
what will make customers happy , though , depends on their complaints			2
@entity244 said he 'd be happier if the @entity18 ran airport security that looked more like it did before september 11 , 2001 , before liquid bans , body scanners and shoe removal			1
he calls the @entity18 's best - known processes " security theater " but said there 's no political will to eliminate it			1
" everyone complains about the @entity18 , but nobody really wants to be on the hook for getting it wrong , " he said			2
the golden days of air travel : how glorious were they ? @entity105 , the consumer advocate and author of " scammed : how to @entity302 in a @entity303 , " said he 'd feel better about the @entity18 if it eliminated its @entity297 , or @entity297 , teams at train stations and @entity300 games and instead stuck to airport security			1
when he 's in line to fly , he wants better explanations about @entity18 procedures and to know that more money is steered toward intelligence instead of " unconstitutional " scans and pat - downs			2
" it 's a matter of using billions of dollars in a smarter way , " he said			0
" there 's always going to be people that say , ' if you take a step back , you 're going to create the next 9/11			0
' those are paranoid voices , and they 're always going to be there			0
i have to listen to the rational voices that say we 've gone too far			0
" the @entity324 family in @entity15 wants @entity18 agents trained so everyone with a medical device or condition can make it through security checkpoints safely , said @entity331 , whose daughter 's insulin pump was replaced after its ill - fated trip through @entity13 's airport			1
@entity324 said they respect that @entity18 officers are highly trained and low - paid and " have an important job to do			2
" she can even understand why security officers wanted to send @entity25 through the scanner : it was busy , scanners are quick , and the public usually is n't thrilled about security agents patting down teenage girls			0
but the @entity324 family is n't flying again until they 're confident their kids -- both of whom have type 1 diabetes -- will have pumps that work beyond the checkpoint			0
insulin pumps can cost $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 , @entity324 said , and it can be hard for pump users to switch back to injections			0
the family will be driving to their summer vacation destinations this year			0
the agency said last month that it would respond directly to the @entity324 family and that it regularly works with disability and medical condition advocacy groups to adapt screening procedures			0
indeed , @entity324 said , they spoke with @entity18 officials on a conference call this week and are reviewing a proposal they hope will make flying easier for diabetics			2
so far , @entity324 said , the @entity18 has been slow but responsive			2
" we could be their best advocate			0
this could be a total turnaround and nice pr for them , " @entity324 said			0
" right now , our relationship is really amicable , and we 'd like to keep it that way			0

complaints to the @entity18 have dropped
industry observers say tension is bubbling , but feelings toward @entity18 were worse in 2010
