-- when the @entity3 regents were looking for a new president for perhaps the best public university system in the world -- with 10 campuses and more than 230,000 students -- they chose homeland security secretary @entity9 ? what ? @entity12 sheriff @entity11 was n't available ? at @entity14 , @entity15 , and the other @entity3 campuses , students who are undocumented immigrants -- the so - called @entity13 -- should be packing their stuff and seeking sanctuary at the nearest community college			1
one day , all @entity3 students might need to produce their green cards , birth certificates , or proof of citizenship when they enroll			2
soon there will be a new sheriff in town			0
one who makes @entity29 look like @entity30			0
it 's easy to see why @entity33 might wants this plum assignment -- outgoing president @entity35 makes $ 591,000 , triple her salary at @entity38			1
( @entity35 's total compensation : $ 847,149 )			0
the real question is why should @entity41 want her ? after all , this is a state where the population is more than 38 % @entity45			0
and , in the first three years of the @entity47 administration , with @entity33 -- a former @entity48 governor -- at the helm riding herd over @entity47 's immigration policy , @entity45 were vocal in expressing their anger with them			1
the president was heckled at the @entity60 conference in july 2011 over the failure to honor his campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority , the record number of deportations on his watch , and his refusal to grant deferred status to @entity66			1
in dec 2011 , a survey by the @entity68 found that @entity45 disapproved of the administration 's handling of the immigration issue by a ratio of more than 2 to 1 -- 59 % to 27 %			2
in june 2012 , @entity47 announced an accommodation for @entity66 where they could apply for deferred status , get a work permit and avoid deportation for two years			2
but those early years , 2009 to 2011 , were terrible , and @entity33 took much of the flak			0
she is still persona non grata in parts of the @entity45 community			0
in a statement last week , @entity80 , executive director of @entity81 , a grass - roots organization that goes to bat for immigrants and seeks to give @entity85 a voice in politics , was refreshingly direct			0
@entity33 will , he said , " go into the halls of history as president @entity47 's go - to person for implementing the most repressive anti-latino and anti-immigrant policies our nation has ever seen			1
" meanwhile , @entity47 said this : " since @entity97 , @entity9 has led my administration 's effort to secure our borders , deploying a historic number of resources , while also taking steps to make our immigration system fairer and more consistent with our values			2
" at current rates , by the end of 2014 the @entity47 administration will have deported 2 million people , forced local police departments across the country through the @entity114 program to enforce federal immigration law in an @entity48 - crackdown style , divided hundreds of thousands of families , and -- according to data recently obtained by the @entity120 - based @entity119 through the @entity121 -- held hundreds of immigrant minors in adult detention facilities without access to legal counsel , for periods ranging from three days to six months			2
are these the values you 're talking about , mr. president ? @entity33 is a convenient villain for the @entity130			0
yet she merely carried out the president 's immigration strategy , which is three parts heavy - handed enforcement to one part feel - good rhetoric about supporting immigration reform with little action to back up the words			1
this is the game that @entity47 and @entity33 have been running			2
@entity47 would talk about how he 'd like to suspend the deportations ; then @entity33 would deliver the reality check and say : " no way , @entity144			1
" @entity47 would address a @entity45 group and assure them -- falsely it turns out -- that the only people being deported are violent criminals ; and @entity33 would brag to @entity148 about how her department has deported record numbers of people with all sorts of backgrounds and promise to remove more next year			1
@entity47 was the good cop , and @entity33 was the bad cop			1
now the bad cop is on her way out , and we 're going to see how " good " the good cop really is			1
now that @entity33 is headed to @entity41 , many of us are holding our breath			0
who knows what is coming our way ? meanwhile , immigration reform advocates should hold their applause			1
her boss is still in @entity168 , and he is still in charge of an immigration policy that has , for the last four and a half years , wreaked havoc on countless lives			0
regardless of who replaces @entity33 , expect more of the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			0

@entity176 : @entity33 @entity38 deportation record should worry students at @entity3
he says her boss , @entity47 , *lagged* on immigration reform , but not on record deportations
he says @entity33 has been " bad cop " to @entity47 's empty " good cop " rhetoric on immigration
he says reform advocates should be *concerned* over whom @entity47 taps next for her *job*
