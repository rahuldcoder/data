@entity0 , @entity1 -- when prince @entity4 marries @entity5 with the whole world watching friday , it will be a far cry from the private engagement at a rustic log cabin in the quiet @entity10 wilderness			1
the couple was engaged at the @entity0 cabin on the northern slopes of @entity1 , a secluded getaway near a sprawling animal reserve where rhinos and giraffes roam freely			1
prince @entity4 and @entity5 secretly flew into the country in october and headed to the @entity19 , where he had spent a year before going to the @entity20 in @entity21			1
" @entity1 has always been very close to prince @entity4 's heart			1
he 's been coming here for many years			0
he loves it , " said @entity24 , founder of the @entity19 and owner of the cabin			2
however , the october visit was different			0
the prince was waiting for the perfect opportunity to pop the question , his mother 's ring stashed in his backpack			2
" i had been carrying it around in my rucksack for three weeks before that , and i literally would not let it go , " the prince said in an official interview after the engagement			1
" wherever i went , i kept hold of it because i knew this thing , if it disappeared , i would be in a lot of trouble			0
" he finally found the perfect spot at the cabin , which has a clear view of @entity1 , the nation 's highest mountain			1
he proposed to his college sweetheart at the secluded spot surrounded by crisp lakes and whistling birds			0
prince @entity4 , the second in line to the @entity59 throne , will marry @entity5 at @entity60 in @entity61 on friday			1
@entity5 said the proposal left her shocked			1
" we were out there with friends and things , so i really did n't expect it at all , " she said			0
the royal family 's relationship with @entity1 is not new			1
princess @entity70 was in the east @entity10 nation in 1952 when she found out her father had died and she was to become queen			0
more than half a century later , the country 's tie to the royal family remains			0
" i think he wanted to share @entity1 with his new bride , unknown to us at the time , " @entity24 said			2
prince @entity4 and his bride - to - be stayed in the more spacious of the two log - cabins near the @entity19 wildlife reserve , nothing like the lavish @entity85			1
it features the bare minimum ; a fireplace , a couch and a canopy bed with thick woolly blankets			1
guests fish in private rivers near their cabin			2
at night , candles and cackling fires provide light			0
what the cottage lacks in luxury , it makes up in the view , with panoramic scenes of @entity1 and the @entity104			1
" he 's a true romantic and we had a wonderful holiday in @entity10 , " @entity5 said after the engagement			1
" it was very romantic and it was a very personal time for both of us			0
" temperatures in the high altitude area drop drastically as the sun sets			0
simple surroundings and chilly nights aside , the prince was well equipped for the trip			2
" brought more warm clothes this time ! " he wrote in the cabin guestbook			0
there was one problem , though			0
the pair did not catch any fish during their stay			0
" sadly no fish to be found but we had great fun trying , " @entity5 wrote in the guestbook			2
she however headed home with a far bigger prize : a sapphire engagement ring .			0
