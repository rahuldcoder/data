@entity1 industrialists are sounding the alarm over a growing skills shortage on the continent that threatens their competitiveness and leaves manufacturing companies scrambling to find enough engineers			1
chief executives of some of @entity1 's biggest manufacturers said that problems around youth unemployment , demographics and the education system all mean that engineers could be increasingly difficult to find in the future			1
this would force their companies to move more research and development facilities to countries with a greater supply of engineers , such as @entity23 or @entity24			0
" by 2025 , we might need 500,000 engineers , " said @entity25 , chief executive , of @entity26 , the world 's second - biggest truckmaker			1
@entity31 , chief executive of @entity32 , @entity1 's largest engineering group , said " the skills shortage , particularly in @entity34 , is a big issue			1
we have to ensure that our education system is providing the right engineering skills , that we have qualified immigration coming to @entity1			2
and perhaps the biggest issue that @entity1 industry has to grapple with is that we have almost 24 per cent youth unemployment			2
" their warnings come as the @entity43 starts a four - day series into how @entity1 manufacturing has fared in the eurozone crisis and the challenges it faces in the future			2
many of @entity1 's leading industrialists laid out an array of problems facing the continent 's manufacturers , from more expensive energy compared with @entity57 competitors to the lack of financing , especially in countries such as @entity61 and @entity62 for small companies			1
" we are losing a lot of small companies that support medium - sized business like ours due to financing problems , " said @entity64 , chief executive of @entity65 , an @entity61 company that is the world 's largest maker of vertical lathes			0
industrial production in the @entity74 remains more than 10 per cent below its pre-crisis peak from 2008 , while manufacturing companies have shed 3.4m of the 35.4m workers they had at the same time			0
but some manufacturing company executives also argued that @entity1 industry was holding its own against both the old - world competition from the @entity57 and @entity82 and newer rivals from @entity23 or @entity24			0
" let 's stop being pessimistic			0
yes , we have to face a moment of crisis and a moment of restructuring in many countries but companies are continuing to develop			0
@entity1 stands for high quality and keeps on innovating even more , " said @entity91 , chief executive of @entity93 's @entity92			2
nonetheless , business leaders are worried about the skills of @entity1 's newly educated workers compared with estimates of at least 400,000 and 100,000 engineers graduating each year from @entity23 and @entity24 respectively			1
@entity34 alone currently lacks 70,000 engineers , according to the @entity101 , the association of @entity34 engineers			1
mr @entity25 said that other issues such as the availability of energy and regulation were important but meant little without skilled workers			0
" if you do n't have a good , transparent , motivating education and innovation system , then the other things are very difficult to achieve , " he added .			0
