a screen grab of the decree was captured before it was deleted			0
no front page coverage , the story should n't be bigger than half a page on newspapers			2
tv channels shall not run long feature reports			0

" the silver jeep was found abandoned just over an hour later with the child unharmedâ € ” after the perp phoned in the car 's location to police , " the @entity206 reported			2
@ @entity215 : " ironically it 's the same story but with very different outcomes ! i believe that race has nothing to do with it but the problem is that @entity4 people 's moral education is disgusting			1
also , brain - dead parents have no qualifications for parenthood			2
" @ @entity225 : " it 's either a matter of better law or purer hearts			0
" as the finger - pointing continues , other netizens have turned their ire on the police			1
one noted how the government in @entity32 , the city where the crime took place , had since 2007 invested 140 million yuan ( $ 22.5 million ) to install a " @entity131 project " an intra-city video surveillance network , equipped with some 60,000 closed - circuit cameras			0
a micro-blogger named @ @entity245 wryly noted : " citizens found the stolen car , the suspect turned himself in , thousands of police searched downtown while the man had escaped to the countryside already			0
a camera surveillance system worth 140 million yuan went blind in this case			0
