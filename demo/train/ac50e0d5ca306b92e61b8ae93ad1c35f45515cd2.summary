-- mercedes are set to introduce a raft of measures to revive @entity7 's flagging @entity5 fortunes for the upcoming @entity9 @entity8			1
the seven - time champion returned to @entity5 this season after retiring in 2006 but has struggled so far , accumulating only ten points in the opening four races of the campaign			1
but @entity1 team principal @entity16 says changes to @entity7 's car , including a new chassis and improved weight distribution , could help reignite his bid for a record eighth championship in @entity23			1
" it 's not a new chassis per se , it 's a chassis we used in testing , " @entity16 was quoted as saying on the official @entity5 web site			1
" the one he had got damaged during the first few races , and we repaired it as best we could at the races			2
but now we are back at base we are going to re-introduce the test chassis , and he will be using that in @entity23			0
" it has taken @entity7 a little time to settle into these cars and particularly the tires			2
these tires are very different to what he had last time he was racing			0
" @entity7 is being outperformed by @entity1 teammate @entity43 , who has battled his way to second in the standings			1
but @entity16 is confident the 41 - year - old will be pushing the front runners soon			0
" it 's foolish to say @entity7 is where he wants to be , but he 's very determined to succeed , " @entity16 said in comments attributed to reuters.com			1
" i think these frustrations are just going to make him try even harder			0
" we 've not had a fantastic start but we are still in there because no - one else is really dominating either - there is still plenty of opportunity			0
" he is so determined , and you can see that in his driving			0
the bits where it 's not quite working are not because of [ lack of ] skill or bravery , it 's because the technique needs tuning , and the car needs tuning			2
" it 's odd places where he 's losing time and that 's why we think he 'll sort it out and we 'll sort it out			2
" the @entity9 @entity8 gets underway in @entity23 on may 9 .			0
