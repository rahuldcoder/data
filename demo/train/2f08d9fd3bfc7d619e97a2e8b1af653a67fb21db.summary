@entity0 , @entity1 -- a person allowed to enter a juvenile detention center for girls in @entity1 would find one strikingly sad story after another , according to @entity8			1
nearly all of the girls imprisoned in @entity1 are behind bars for " moral crimes , " as are about half of adult women , a new report from the international watchdog group says			1
the arrests are often based on two actions considered criminal behavior			0
one is running away from home without the permission of their father or husband ; the other is called @entity26 , having sex with anyone other than a husband			1
" very often you see women have been charged with both things -- with running away and with @entity26			1
and when you dig a bit deeper and you talk to the women about what actually happened , what you find out is that ... a large majority of these cases are cases where women have actually run away from abuse , " @entity33 of @entity8 @entity1 told @entity2			1
" they 've run away because they were about to be forced into a marriage against their will or they 've run away because they 've actually been married and they are experiencing abuse in the home from their husband or their in - laws			2
" @entity57 soldier died saving @entity1 girl in 2011 , @entity2 highlighted a case in point			2
a woman named @entity62 was jailed and sentenced to 12 years in prison after reporting she was raped by her cousin 's husband			0
her daughter was the product of the rape			0
@entity62 's plight attracted international attention and she was freed when president @entity71 intervened			0

" to be honest , they do not have a future going back into the community			0
their husbands will not accept them back and neither will their families or members of the community			0
" @entity77 said she is disappointed in the @entity1 judicial system when it comes to its treatment of women			1
" our laws are quite equal for men and women , but men have the means to pay bribe money , run away from home , ( or ) ask others for help to get out of a situation , " she said			0
@entity77 is well aware that even being a female in a position of power can not save a person from danger			0
threats and intimidation have occurred against women in politics , mostly because they are women			0
" i blame the judicial system , the judges , and the system as a whole before anything else , " she said			2
" the system is simply not supporting women , and until they do , these so - called ' crimes ' against women will continue and we will only slip back into what we were 10 years ago			1
" @entity8 says about 400 women currently are imprisoned in @entity1 for " moral crimes			1
