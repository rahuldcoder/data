@entity0 -- the @entity3 congressman spearheading a @entity5 probe of alleged @entity7 targeting of conservative political groups accused the head of the @entity7 on tuesday of obstructing his panel 's investigation			1
@entity13 @entity3 rep. @entity12 , chairman of the @entity14 , warned acting @entity7 chief @entity15 that if " the @entity7 continues to hinder the committee 's investigation in any manner , the committee will be forced to consider use of compulsory process			1
" @entity12 did not elaborate on exactly what steps his panel 's @entity3 majority may be prepared to take , though he noted that impeding congressional investigators could result in a prison term of up to five years			1
" obstructing a congressional investigation is a crime , " @entity12 stressed in a letter co-signed by rep. @entity28 , @entity29			1
" despite your promise to cooperate fully with congressional investigations , the actions of the @entity7 under your leadership have made clear to the committee that the agency has no intention of complying completely or promptly with the committee 's oversight efforts , " @entity12 said			1
" the systematic manner in which the @entity7 has attempted to delay , frustrate , impede , and obstruct the committee 's investigation raises serious concerns about your commitment to full and unfettered congressional oversight , " @entity12 wrote			1
responding to @entity12 's claim , an @entity7 spokeswoman told @entity1 the agency is " aggressively responding to the numerous data requests we 've received from @entity53			1
" " we are doing everything we can to fully cooperate with the committees , and we strongly disagree with any suggestions to the contrary , " @entity54 said			0
among other things , @entity12 claimed the @entity7 has handed over only 12,000 of the more than 64 million pages of documents initially identified as potentially relevant to the investigation into the alleged unfair targeting of conservative outfits seeking tax - exempt status			1
" this incredibly slow pace of production has been an unnecessary attempt to frustrate the committee 's oversight efforts , " he said			0
@entity72 , in turn , argued that " while the volume of raw data collected ... is quite high , it is a misleading figure to use in order to determine the volume of material the @entity7 will ultimately produce			0
" " the vast majority of it is completely unrelated to the congressional investigations , " she said			0
" once the data is limited to the time period in question , and the issue in question , we expect the final tally of produced documents will be far lower -- in the neighborhood of 460,000 documents or fewer			0
" @entity92 said 70 of roughly 1,500 attorneys in the @entity7 chief counsel 's office are currently working full time to respond to congressional inquiries into the matter			2
it is a " time and labor intensive review process , " she said			0
for his part , @entity12 also complained that documents produced by the @entity7 " contain excessive redactions that go well beyond those necessary to protect confidential taxpayer information			2
" furthermore , @entity12 asserted that a senior @entity7 official -- @entity107 -- had been " affirmatively prevented " from providing congressional investigators with relevant documents in her possession			2
additionally , the chairman blasted the @entity7 for allegedly trying to " carefully orchestrate the public release " of information contained in a 30 - day review of the matter back in june -- before providing the information to the committee			0
@entity12 and other @entity3 have insisted for months that after president @entity118 was first elected , the @entity7 started unfairly targeting conservative outfits seeking tax - exempt status			1
democrats , however , argue the @entity7 improperly scrutinized groups on both the left and right as part of a clumsy attempt to administer vague election - related tax laws			2
@entity7 inspector general : liberals also on target list at a speech in his home state of @entity133 last week , @entity118 ripped what he labeled @entity0 's " endless parade of distractions , political posturing and phony scandals			0
" the controversy has been the subject of numerous congressional hearings			0
and on monday , @entity12 and @entity28 argued for a new investigation -- this time into alleged @entity7 targeting of conservative groups that already have tax - exempt status			1
@entity147 rep. @entity146 , the top @entity148 on @entity12 's panel , called the information underlying the new assertion " partial and incomplete , " and designed to fit a pre-existing " political narrative			0
" @entity5 @entity3 leaders have indicated they intend to keep publicly pressing on the issue this week , voting on a proposal to prevent the @entity7 from implementing or enforcing any provisions in the president 's health care reform law			2
@entity159 have also suggested their members highlight the matter during the upcoming august congressional recess .			0
