@entity0 -- @entity3 student @entity2 is a force to be reckoned with			1
the sophomore is a @entity6 major , co-leads @entity7 -- @entity3 's team that built and raced a solar - powered car in the @entity10 -- and is a president 's scholar , representing the top 2 % of enrolled students at the university			2
it 's safe to say he must have a lot of energy -- and it appears to have been unleashed during his welcome speech sunday to this year 's freshman class			2
it started out like many other convocations			0
faculty , staff and notable guests , including @entity2 -- dressed in a traditional black robe with his mortarboard perfectly perched upon his head -- addressed the new recruits : " we chose @entity3 because we want to do the impossible			2
" but then , something unexpected started to unfold			0
music from " 2001 : a @entity38 " began as @entity2 quoted sir @entity34 : " if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants			1
" as the trumpets from the iconic movie theme song swelled , so did @entity2 's passion , with the cadence a drill sergeant would envy			1
" crush the shoulders of the giants upon whom we stand			0
we here are all such innovative people			0
so i am telling you : if you want to change the world , you 're at @entity3 ! you can do that ! if you want to build the @entity51 suit , you 're at @entity3 ! you can do that ! and if you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a bad ass , we 're at @entity3 , we can do that ! i am doing that ! " @entity2 breathlessly finished the speech with his arms raised in victory , to applause from the roughly 4,000 people in attendance -- some of whom seemed a little shell - shocked from his intensity			1
after a brief pause , @entity2 deadpanned with a smirk : " congratulations on your acceptance and brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer			0
" that last phrase was a reference to refrain of the school 's famous fight song			0
freshmen , wearing their traditional yellow caps slightly askew , appeared stunned ; and they were n't the only ones			0
video of the speech is going viral with over 340,000 hits since being posted monday			1
comments on the video range from poking fun at @entity2 's appearance -- " welcome to @entity89 , " a reference to @entity2 's @entity96 - like appearance -- to enthusiasm			1
one person commented , " i am 30 yrs old , i already went to college			0
i am married , i have a kid , and a full time job in @entity102 ... and after watching that , i just applied to @entity3 " another person felt the speech was so epic that becoming @entity2 's best friend feels possible " because i go to @entity3 ! "			1
