the prosecutor called @entity25 " a methodical and merciless killer			1
" on friday afternoon , @entity30 appeared before @entity3 judge @entity40 , who , at the request of attorneys , rescheduled @entity30 's arraignment to november 29			1
@entity25 is not taking his antipsychotic medication , and his attorney asked the court to make the drugs available to @entity30 while he is being held in jail without bail			1
the judge said he would order a medical team to evaluate @entity51 and , in a response to another defense request , would see if @entity30 's current wife could deliver his spinal cord implant stimulator , which is needed because of a 2007 accident @entity25 experienced			1
@entity57 and with a salt - and - pepper goatee , @entity30 appeared calm inside the courtroom 's detainee cage			1

we do n't know the contents of their conversation or anything , " @entity2 said			0
hours later , the gunfire rampage at the salon , just blocks from the ocean , unfolded around 1:20 p.m. , authorities said			2

he was armed with three guns -- a 9 mm @entity99 , a @entity100 , and a @entity101 .45 -- and was wearing body armor during the shooting rampage , @entity2 said			0

for almost two minutes , @entity30 shot victim after victim , executing people by shooting them in the head and chest			2
" he shot eight people inside the salon			0
but he was not done			0
he then walked out of the salon and shot a ninth victim , a male , who was sitting nearby in a parked @entity122			0
the reason for this rampage : revenge , " he said			0
" we believe that the defendant committed this unimaginable act of violence because he wanted to kill his ex-wife over a custody dispute concerning their 8 - year - old son			1
he was willing to end any life in his path , and he did			0
clearly this two - minute murder spree could not have been about loving his son , " the prosecutor said			1
while @entity30 allegedly carried out the mass murder , his son was sitting alone in the principal 's office at school , waiting for his mother or father to pick him up , authorities said			1
" that little boy is also a victim			0

" we do know that the victims were shot multiple times each , " @entity2 said			0
