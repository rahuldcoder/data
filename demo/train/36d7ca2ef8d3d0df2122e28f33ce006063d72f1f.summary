-- @entity1 , the two - year - old girl who was left for dead on a narrow street in southern @entity4 after a hit - and - run accident , has died			1
the toddler , nicknamed @entity7 , had been cared for in a hospital in @entity10 province since she was injured a week ago			1
she succumbed to severe injuries friday morning			2
two hit - and - run drivers ran over @entity7 , one after another , after she wandered into the alley outside her father 's hardware store			1
both fled the scene but are now under arrest			2
but there was one thing more shocking than the double hit - and - run : the seeming apathy by pedestrians , cyclists and drivers — 18 of them — who did not stop to help			1
@entity7 laid motionless in the street for 10 minutes until @entity28 , a 58 - year - old woman who collects trash for a living , passed by			1
she moved her to safety and called for help			2
a security camera captured the incident on tape			1
after the video was posted online , @entity7 's plight prompted sympathy , outrage and debate in and outside @entity4			1
how could 18 people pass by the critically injured child and do nothing ? the incident has also prompted widespread soul - searching in @entity4 about the state of the nation 's morality and civic - consciousness			1
why is it so difficult for @entity4 nowadays to be a @entity53 ? there are many possible explanations and many possible culprits			1
some blame it on the lack of laws and regulations			2
others argue it 's caused by the failure of @entity4 's education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity			1
still others blame it on what some call " jingshen kongxu " , or spiritual vacuum			2
as the country 's 1.3 billion people compete to make money and climb the economic and social ladder , experts say , many people find themselves spiritually adrift			2
@entity81 , an astute @entity4 - watcher , cautions against making sweeping conclusions			1
" it 's funny how many people read into this , to the point that anti-chinese sentiment arises , " he wrote me			2
" this situation is not unique to @entity4			1
" he cites the case of @entity91			2
in 1964 , the woman in @entity93 , @entity94 was chased and stabbed to death by an assailant over the course of half an hour while 38 of her neighbors watched from their windows and did nothing to help			2
psychologists , @entity81 tells me , have dubbed this phenomenon the ' bystander problem ' — the one factor that would predict @entity53 behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event : the more bystanders , the less likely someone will step up to help			1
i asked @entity111 , a socio - psychology professor at @entity112 , about the seeming callousness of the 18 passersby			1
one factor is the district where it occurred , which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one @entity7 's father owns			2
" ( they ) are owners of hardware stores originally from different parts of @entity4 who hardly know each other			1
together they comprise a ' strangers ' society ' , instead of one made up of real friends and acquaintances , or the " acquaintances ' society '			0
" @entity111 said the two sub-groups are fundamentally different			0
" in an ' acquaintances ' society ' , " he explained , " their relationship is of intimacy , trust and interdependence			0
in the ' strangers ' society ' it is characterized by estrangement , distrust , and independence			0
in such a society , it is not surprising to see incidents like this			0
" @entity149 , a law professor at @entity150 likewise cites the changes brought about by rapid urbanization			0
" in big cities , where many people have moved in from outside , where there are thousands of newcomers from the provinces , there 's a feeling that you are better off just leaving people you do n't know alone , " he said in a @entity0 interview			0
other observers blame the incident on a breakdown in public trust			1
a joint survey by three universities in @entity171 revealed that the root cause of people 's reluctance to help others in need is a lack of trust among residents			0
only about 8 % surveyed said they still strongly trust other people			0
should an elderly person in need be helped ? over 60 % of the respondents said " yes " , but more than 84 % also believed it is too risky ; recently in @entity4 , there have been several cases of individuals who faked injuries only to sue those who come to their aid			1
in 2006 , an old woman in the eastern city of @entity193 was injured after rough jostling at a bus stop			0
@entity196 , a young man and fellow passenger , offered help and even took her to the hospital			0
later , however , the old woman and her family sued him in court , which eventually ruled that @entity196 should pay 40 % of the medical costs			0
similar cases have happened in recent years			0
" there must be something wrong when it is considered risky to be a @entity53 , " @entity205 wrote in an editorial this week			1
" @entity209 and distrust are the last things a harmonious society needs			0
it is imperative that we find a way to protect good samaritans from being wronged			0
" @entity112 's @entity111 calls this the " interpersonal trust crisis "			0
he explains : " this kind of crisis is highly contagious and could deteriorate due to lack of legal support			0
as a netizen puts it , it 's not that the good people can no longer be found in our society			0
it 's that nobody can afford to do good deeds — the price can be too high			0
" days after @entity7 's tragic accident , millions of @entity4 's micro-bloggers are still pouring out their anger and frustration			1
" after @entity196 's case , if you were the first to find @entity7 after the accident , would you rescue her ? " netizen @entity237 wrote			0
that is a question many in @entity4 are now asking themselves .			1

a 2 - year - old toddler in @entity4 died after being hit by two separate cars
video shows neither driver stopped to help , nor did 18 passersby
incident has caused an *uproar* around @entity4 , as well as soul - searching
" there must be something wrong when it is considered risky to be a @entity53 "
