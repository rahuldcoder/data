" there 's not any jumping ahead of anyone , " says @entity7 's regional vice president for @entity21 , @entity22 , but he admits it is n't for lack of effort			2
" they try all the time , " he says			0
the appeal of the @entity32 -- that can carry up to 18 people -- comes down to size , speed and range			1
with a top speed of @entity39 -- close to the speed of sound -- it is faster than any other civilian aircraft in use			1
the range of up to 7,000 nautical miles means passengers could fly from @entity45 to @entity46 without refueling ( a headache for the jet - setting , long - range business crowd )			1
the new plane has been a boon for @entity7 after the financial crisis put a squeeze on the business jet industry			2
" given how difficult the market has been since 2008 to have something the market is fighting to get , instead of fighting to sell , is pretty good , " says @entity56 from aviation consultancy @entity57			0

analysts say those planes just do n't appeal to the status conscious the way the @entity7 does , with its signature large , oval windows and sleek exterior			2
" they just do n't look as good			0
i think that counts for something , " says @entity56			0
