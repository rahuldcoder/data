@entity0 -- two undocumented workers from @entity3 and one from @entity4 have reached court settlements in recent weeks for a total of $ 3.85 million in damages for @entity0 construction - site accidents , an attorney for the men announced wednesday			1
" all three cases involve construction and terribly unsafe working conditions , " the attorney , @entity11 , said in a news conference			1
" we 're here today to re-emphasize -- as we have in the past -- to the @entity19 community and all undocumented workers that they have the same rights once they 're on the job as any @entity0 citizen			1
" a 33 - year - old undocumented plumber from @entity3 who was scalded by an exploding pipe at a @entity28 construction site in 2004 settled his damage claim for $ 2.5 million , according to a statement given to reporters at the news conference			1
the married father of two , who says he still has nightmares from the accident , hopes to open a restaurant or bar with the settlement money , his cousin told reporters			0
in a separate statement , owners of the @entity28 site said only that the injured plumber was " employed directly by [ the ] contractor and not by the owner of the property nor the managing agent			2
" reached through a public relations firm , a spokesperson for the contractor , @entity49 , had no comment			0
another undocumented @entity3 worker suffered severe injuries to his left foot and other parts of his body when a steel beam fell on his lower body at a building site in downtown @entity61 , the news conference statement said			1
the 52 - year - old settled his damage claim against @entity64 and @entity65 for $ 750,000 , according to the statement			2
@entity67 , a managing member of @entity64 , said he was not familiar with the case			0
@entity65 , the site 's contractor , did not respond to inquiries			0
a 36 - year - old @entity4 laborer who worked at the @entity73 community in @entity74 -- a neighborhood @entity76 has called a " bright spot " in the housing market for its strong sales and low foreclosure rates -- settled a damage claim for $ 600,000 , the news conference statement said			1
he was injured when three large 44x10 - foot trusses , each weighing 200 pounds , collapsed onto him in august 2007 , fracturing his hip and causing other injuries , according to the statement			2
the father of three , who had worked in construction for more than a decade and owned his own company at the time of the accident , said he was very sad after the accident because he did not know how he would support his family			2
his two sons , now 7 and 8 , and his 16 - year - old daughter were all born in the @entity96			2
" the contractor tried to blame me , " he said at the news conference , speaking in @entity98			0

messages left for the @entity109 , developers of @entity73 , were not returned			0
@entity110 , executive director of @entity111 , an immigrant advocacy group , said that while construction work is often dangerous , undocumented workers are likely to work at sites that lack safety equipment and @entity117 regulation compliance			1
" this is a great day for the undocumented immigrants , " @entity110 said			0
" they have to know today that they have rights -- the same rights as other workers who are @entity96 citizens or permanent residents			2
" " many workers are threatened by their employers with deportation or discharge if they bring their cases to court , " @entity11 said			0
" what we find normally on work sites in @entity0 is that deaths occur to the undocumented far out of proportion to their work in the workplace , and that is because of the fact that they just do not receive the safety protections , " he said			1
in 2005 , @entity11 won a historic $ 4 million settlement for a 33 - year - old @entity3 worker who had fallen 30 feet in a scaffolding accident in the @entity148			1
the injured worker , who was hospitalized for four weeks and underwent seven surgeries after the 2001 accident , told @entity1 on wednesday that workers -- documented or undocumented -- should not to be afraid to stand up for their rights			1
although it is illegal for an employer to knowingly hire a worker who is undocumented , according to the @entity0 mayor 's @entity159 , if an undocumented worker is hired by an employer , he or she then has the right to be paid minimum wage and overtime , the right to health protection and workplace safety , and the right to organize to improve labor conditions			1
" each of these men was injured in the course of their work on construction sites , and their immigration status was irrelevant to their right to seek redress for those injuries , " @entity11 explained in a statement			1
" enforcing laws requiring a safe workplace serves the interests of all @entity96 , whether they are citizens or not			0
" the men involved in the settlements said they chose to remain anonymous to protect relatives outside of the @entity96 , who could become the target of kidnapping schemes if knowledge of their settlements became public .			0
