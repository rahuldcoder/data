-- the experience of @entity2 could be the key to monday 's potentially title - deciding @entity5 derby , according to one of the veteran manager 's former stalwarts @entity9			1
the @entity10 retired last year after @entity11 claimed a record 19th @entity13 championship , but that reign appeared to be over earlier this season as big - spending @entity15 took pole position under the guidance of @entity18			1
a form slump allowed @entity11 to move eight points clear at the top -- but that has been cut to three with three games to play ahead of the clash at @entity15 's @entity25			1
@entity2 is the most successful @entity26 manager of the modern era , having won 12 @entity29 titles and two @entity30 crowns in more than quarter of a century at @entity32			2
@entity33 focused on @entity35 's biggest game " he will be right up for it			0
he 's had challenges over the last 26 years against various teams and he beat them , he got down to them and he diminished them and he 's going to do the same with @entity15 , " @entity9 told @entity0			1
" he 's going to motivate the players because it 's a massive moment to win the @entity29			0
he 's going to do it the same way he always does -- of course there are going to be remarks about , ' you have to win otherwise you 're not going to show your face for the next two months in @entity5 , ' all that kind of thing			2
but in general it 's all about tactics			0
" @entity18 guided @entity15 to the club 's first silverware since 1976 with success in the @entity59 last season , but it has been 44 years since a league title was celebrated by the blue half of @entity5			1
" they 've both got strikers on good form -- @entity67 scored a lot of goals , @entity70 scored a lot of goals , " said @entity9 , who played for @entity11 for six seasons			1
" i think @entity15 has slightly a better defensive record			0
but i think the midfield is going to be the place where it 's going to be decided			0
" hopefully my old teammates are up for it , can withstand the pressure			0
" the 41 - year - old revealed he was hoping for a draw , which would leave @entity11 in the box seat ahead of final games at home to @entity86 and away to @entity87			1
city must next travel to @entity30 - chasing @entity90 and relegation - threatened @entity91			0
" my heart is right , of course you want a win for @entity11 , and a draw would be fine also			2
so let 's go for a draw , a 1 - 1 or something to decide who 's going to win the @entity29			1
that would be great , " he said			0
@entity9 is one of the few footballers to have won the @entity30 with two different teams -- helping deliver @entity105 the title in 1995 and repeating the feat with @entity11 in 2008			2
the man named @entity110 @entity109 in 1995 and 2009 said that the @entity5 derby had grown in importance in the last year along with @entity15 's fortunes			1
" i remember when i came here and played a game and even lost during one of the seasons -- we lost both games -- but still ended up winning the league			0
they were still so happy that they won from us , even though we ended up winning the league so it did n't really matter that much , " he said .			0
