-- @entity1 has been reflecting on his meltdown at the masters , after the 21 - year - old squandered a four - stroke lead going into the final round at @entity7 , eventually carding an eight - over - par 80 to finish 10 strokes behind winner @entity9			1
speaking to the official @entity12 website , the @entity10 said : " i 'm very disappointed			1
" i was leading this golf tournament with nine holes to go , and i just unraveled			2
hit a bad tee shot on 10 , and then never really recovered			1
it 's going to be hard to take for a few days , but i 'll get over it			2
" @entity1 is not alone in crumbling on the back nine whilst leading the masters and joins a famous list that includes great names such as @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
can @entity1 conquer mental minefield ? and @entity26 admitted that when he missed the fairway on the 13th hole , he knew his @entity12 dream had died			1
" i 'd knew that unless i birdied my way in , i realized i did n't have a chance , " @entity1 said			0
" i realized that was it then			0
" but this is my first experience at it and hopefully the next time i 'm in this position i 'll be able to handle it better			0
" i did n't handle it particularly well obviously , but it was a character - building day , put it that way			2
i 'll come out stronger for it			0
" and , speaking on his @entity46 feed , @entity1 quoted @entity47 , saying : " it 's repetition of affirmations that leads to belief -- and once that belief becomes a deep conviction , things begin to happen			1
" @entity26 also received some words of encouragement from @entity9 who said : " golf is a really funny game -- one moment you 're on top of it , the next moment it bites you			1
" @entity1 is going to feel hurt			0
it 's not easy what he went through			0
he is such a phenomenal player and he will win one			0
" the first just happens to be the toughest , and that may be the biggest lesson of all , " added the @entity66 .			0
