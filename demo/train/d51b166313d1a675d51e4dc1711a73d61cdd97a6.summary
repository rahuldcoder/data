-- big - spending @entity2 club @entity1 moved a step closer to meeting @entity7 football 's financial fairplay requirements on friday despite posting a loss of almost $ 160 million for last season			1
@entity1 's deficit of £ 97.9 million ( $ 158 million ) for 2011 - 12 's @entity12 - winning campaign was just under half that of the £ 197.5 million ( $ 318 million ) for the previous period -- which was the biggest loss in soccer history			1
the latest figure represents the fourth highest deficit in the @entity2 game -- three of which belong to @entity1 since the arrival of its @entity22 owners in 2008			2
it can be contrasted with the $ 37 million net profit made by rival @entity25 in 2011 - 12			1
@entity25 posted a reduced revenue of £ 320 million ( $ 517 million ) for that period , while @entity1 closed the gap with a club - record turnover of £ 231.1 million ( $ 374 million )			1
both are substantially behind leading @entity32 clubs @entity33 and @entity34			0
@entity35 boosted by first profit in @entity38 era it was the first time that @entity1 had breached the £ 200 million ( $ 323 million ) mark , and reflects the club 's attempts to become more self - sufficient and avoid possible punishment from @entity44 for failing to meet @entity46 targets			1
however , owner @entity47 still injected £ 169 million ( $ 273 million ) in order to keep the club debt free			1

" the hard work of everyone involved at @entity1 over the last four years has begun to create an obvious momentum			0

@entity25 seeks to cash in as sponsor @entity62 is sent packing the club 's revenue would have been higher if not for a group - stage exit from @entity44 's top club competition -- which has been repeated already this season -- but new chief executive @entity68 was satisfied with the results			2
he joined @entity1 in september , having previously helped transform the financial fortunes of @entity34 between 2003 - 08			0
" what i have found is a club on the verge of a historic transformation , reinforced by a genuine commitment to doing things well			0
it is a club with a rich history and the potential for an even brighter future , " he said			0
with the @entity46 rules coming into play from next season , @entity1 officials are under pressure to conform -- or face the possible expulsion from @entity7 competition and a withholding of prize money			2
a 10 - year stadium rights deal with @entity92 -- owned by @entity22 's royal family -- which also includes the club 's under - construction campus has considerably boosted @entity1 's balance sheet			2
it is building an academy to try to avoid paying over the odds for star players in the future -- the £ 201.8 million ( $ 326 million ) wage bill for 2011 - 12 made @entity1 the first @entity2 club to break £ 200 million in salaries , according to the @entity105 website			1
