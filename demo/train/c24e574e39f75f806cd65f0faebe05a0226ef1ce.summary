the young adult novel follows his struggle to abide by the strictures of society			0
what to expect : most of the film 's hype has come from the casting of @entity201 in a bit part , but the 1993 novel has been a longtime favorite and will probably be more centered on @entity6 , played by newcomer @entity224			1
it will be interesting to see how director @entity226 handles the book 's explanation that there is no color in this society			0
