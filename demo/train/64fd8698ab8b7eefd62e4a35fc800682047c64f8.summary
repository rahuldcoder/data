-- as @entity2 walked out onto the stage of the @entity4 last night , there was love in the air			1
television cameras scanned the faces in the crowd and it was as if each man and each woman , regardless of their ages or where they came from , was seeing again the person who first stole their hearts			0
but however deep their affections , however dizzying their passion , it was clear that it was at least equaled by the love of the speaker for the crowd he faced , for the role he was playing and for the limelight he once again commanded			0
throughout @entity2 's 49 - minute address , at turns both masterful and meandering , the intensity of the love affair grew			1
at times , it was almost too much to watch			0
one woman on whom the cameras lingered for a moment was so close to a swoon that i thought she would topple over at any minute and that , in any event , she would never again look at her husband or lover again in the same away			0
they would always be second best			0
it was in that moment easy to imagine that on some level , off - stage , watching , @entity47 was wondering whether he too would suffer a similar fate			1
opinion : @entity2 brings it for @entity47 to be sure , as he strode out to congratulate @entity2 after the speech , @entity47 and his team and his fervent supporters filling the arena in @entity56 were likely thrilled by the job the 42nd president had done in supporting the cause of the 44th			1
but , as @entity62 said on @entity0 shortly after the speech , " @entity2 told the @entity47 story better than @entity47 has			1
" that is saying something , of course : @entity47 is a gifted speaker			2
sometimes , he even soars			0
but as he himself noted recently when asked about his weaknesses during his first term , he has failed to effectively communicate why people should support his policies at critical moments			0
recognizing this is no doubt why @entity47 , who was disinclined to consult with @entity2 early in his presidency as much as the former president would have liked , turned to @entity2 to play such a central role in this convention and in his re-election campaign			1
but there was a risk			0
he would pay a price			0
he would violate one of the first rules of show business : the closer on stage you stand to a taller actor , the shorter you look			0
with his speech last night , as with his post-presidency , his successes at the @entity89 , the ascendancy of his wife as a senator and then as an exceptionally effective secretary of state , and the position he holds with her today , high atop the polls as the most popular leading politicians in the @entity99 , @entity2 has earned consideration as the most dominant @entity102 political figure of the past two decades			1
warts and all , he is to his generation as @entity105 was to his			2
for a man as proud as @entity47 , this must be galling			2
sure , the president is no doubt grateful for the brilliance with which @entity2 defended his policies , the deftness with which he sliced up @entity109 with a razor made of finely honed , carefully forged praise for his @entity116 predecessors			2
@entity47 , like everyone else watching , must have been particularly struck by how @entity2 could speak of the same issues that divide average pols and make them ennobling			1
" we 're all in this together is a far better philosophy than you 're on your own , " was effective			0
but in the current era , his " democracy does not have to be a blood sport			0
it can be an honorable enterprise that advances the public interest " was both timely and transcendent			0
opinion : now it 's up to @entity47 on some level , @entity47 must have wondered , " have i unleashed the reverse @entity135 ? a guy who will upstage me not with ill - conceived clownishness but with genius ? " but eventually , after running on for even longer than his 1988 convention address , one almost universally panned for its verbosity , @entity2 's speech came to a close			1
and when @entity47 walked out to embrace him and then usher him off into the wings , the younger man set the stage for perhaps his last chance to change the @entity2 - centric narrative that has been @entity4 politics since 1992			1
tonight in his address to the delegates in @entity56 and to viewers across @entity102 , @entity47 will have a chance to step up and truly become @entity2 's successor , rather than a supporting player living in his era , in his shadow			1
@entity2 's speech was superb even served as it was without portion control			1
but it did not do what only @entity47 can do			2
it did not offer the current president 's vision for the future			0
it did not offer new solutions to the new problems we face as a country			0
@entity2 may have forcefully said we 're better off now than we were four years ago , but @entity47 can and must say how we will be better off four years hence and how that will better position @entity102 for future growth beyond that			1
@entity2 did n't do that and as an ex-president , he could n't			2
( and mimicking @entity2 - era policies wo n't work because many of them are outdated and frankly some , like financial deregulation , proved wrongheaded			2
) @entity109 has not done it either , his convention speech offering few ideas , no new ones and no specifics			0
wrap - up : 5 lines that killed at the @entity4 the country is at a watershed moment			2
it has only one president at a time and that man right now is @entity47			2
starting with tonight 's speech and continuing through this campaign and into a next term if he has one , by dint of creativity and vision or lack thereof , @entity47 will demonstrate whether he is a new force , not a secondary player , in modern history			1
@entity2 's speech reminded us of his place in history			1
@entity47 's will help determine his			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity209 : @entity2 *dazzled* reverent *audience* that had *eagerly* awaited him
he says @entity47 must have wondered whether he *'ll* seem second best in his speech
he says @entity2 holds *sacred* place in @entity4 politics , rivalling @entity105 in his sway
@entity209 : tonight @entity47 must step out from @entity2 shadow and determine his future
