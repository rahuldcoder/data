when @entity1 could n't get an immigration overhaul though the @entity3 , he gave up			1
when @entity4 could n't get a bill through the @entity6 , he changed the rules			1
rewriting the immigration system was at the core of @entity1 's " compassionate conservatism " political brand and was dear to his heart			1
" it did n't work , " a deflated @entity1 said on a june day seven years ago when the comprehensive reform effort finally died on @entity15			1
faced with failure , he asked his team if he could reshape the immigration system with his own executive power , but they concluded he could n't			2
so @entity1 -- a president who fought the war on terror with an expansive interpretation of executive power -- moved on to other things for his last 18 months in office			1
@entity4 refuses to accept the same fate			1
when immigration reform died in @entity28 this year , @entity4 , like @entity1 , asked his lawyers if he could change the system on his own			1
this @entity6 team came to the opposite conclusion			1
so , more than 500 days since the @entity3 passed a bipartisan immigration bill , @entity4 unveiled his plan to go it alone			1
in a prime - time address , he announced he would wield executive power to patch up the system as best he could , temporarily shielding up to five million people from the threat of deportation			0
he said he had no choice but to go ahead — despite furious claims by @entity43 he is subverting the @entity44 and behaving more like a king than a weakened president hemmed in by a hostile @entity28			0
" to those members of @entity28 who question my authority to make our immigration system work better , or question the wisdom of me acting where @entity28 have failed , i have one answer			1
pass a bill , " @entity4 said			2
the president plans to offer temporary relief from deportation to the parents of @entity61 citizens and permanent residents , who have been in the country for more than five years			0
he 'll also extend a program that already allows undocumented migrants brought here as children to stay in the country			0
the measures are far short of the fix that @entity4 had hoped a permanent comprehensive immigration bill would provide			1
and since he was forced to act via executive order , his moves could be wiped out with the stroke of a pen by a future president			0
but it 's clear that @entity4 is motivated by far more than the prosaic business of fixing the broken immigration system			1
in the two weeks since the @entity43 rout in the mid-term elections dealt what many had thought was a killer blow to his presidency , @entity4 has been working at a furious pace			2
a president who believes he was elected twice to engineer change is not giving up just because @entity28 is in his way			0
@entity88 house speaker @entity88 is noticing and warning of retribution			0
" president @entity4 has cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left , " @entity88 said			2
reforming immigration was always on @entity4 's mind when he took office			1
" it was on the big bucket list of why he was running for president , " said a @entity6 official			2
" climate , immigration and health care were problems that have eluded presidents for decades			0
" " he really thought he had an opportunity to take on all three , " the official said			0
" it looks like he is going to make progress on all three			0
" events that led to thursday night 's address had been unfolding for months , a factor that may explain the noticeable lack of drama surrounding @entity4 's announcement			1
watch : @entity116 : executive action ignores law there was none of the excruciating tension or euphoria that greeted other signature moments of the @entity4 presidency — like the killing of @entity126 , or the passage of health care reform			1
senior administration officials confided that @entity4 signed off on the final details of the plan when he got back from @entity132 this week			2
but administration lawyers had been beavering away for months to flesh out legal justifications			0
many in the @entity6 had thought that it would never get to this point			2
in june 2013 , when the @entity3 bill passed , administration insiders thought that the @entity6 would put a new law on @entity4 's desk to sign			1
officials reasoned that if the @entity43 was ever going to capture the @entity6 again , it needed to mend fences with @entity146 voters after @entity147 was wiped out among the crucial voting block in 2012			2
" it was clear there was going to be momentum for this , " the official said			0
knowing his political brand was radioactive for @entity88 , @entity4 deliberately stepped back in the days after the @entity3 bill passed			2
but his patience began to fray as the months dragged on			0
all the time , @entity4 was feeling heat from immigration activists in his liberal political base — so much so that he made a series of statements to the effect that he could n't just lash out and fix immigration on his own			1
those comments -- intended to give the @entity6 space to do its work -- have instead come back to haunt him and are ammunition for @entity43 who say @entity4 knows he is breaking the law			1
in the end , it seems @entity88 did not believe his position was sustainable atop a restive @entity43 caucus if he used @entity175 votes to pass a bill a separate senior @entity6 official said thursday that the administration had concluded there was no point waiting any longer because @entity88 would not promise to bring up a new bill in the new @entity28			1
" i do n't think there will be a moment when the @entity43 wo n't say ' just wait another day , ' the official said			0
the showdown that precipitated thursday 's speech happened back in june			0
@entity187 and @entity188 were in the @entity6 at a @entity190 event — which might have been a rare moment for @entity88 and @entity4 to bond over one of the few passions they share : golf			1
but afterwards , the president was seething because @entity88 told him he would not be sending him a bill on immigration			0
the speaker later said he told the president that the @entity61 people simply " do n't trust him to enforce the law as written			0
" the decision came against a backdrop of a boiling crisis on the southern border as thousands of child migrants were teeming across the border			0
republicans charged the human tide was triggered directly by the president 's earlier executive order that offered certain categories of @entity213 — undocumented immigrants brought the nation as children — relief from deportation			0
in a mid-term election year , @entity43 had also been spooked by the stunning primary loss of @entity43 @entity6 majority leader @entity221 , who was accused by his insurgent opponent of being too soft on " amnesty			2
" @entity4 snapped in an event a few days later in a @entity226 speech			2
" pass a bill ; solve a problem			0
do n't just say no on something that everybody needs to be done , " he said .			0
