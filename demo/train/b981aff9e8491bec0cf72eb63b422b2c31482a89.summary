president @entity0 is sending up to 1,500 more soldiers to @entity2 to train @entity2 and @entity4 forces to fight @entity5 , in a deployment that would almost double the total number of @entity9 troops there to 2,900			1
the @entity10 said in a statement that it will also ask @entity12 for another $ 5.6 billion to fund the fight against @entity5			1
the troops will not have a combat role , and will operate from bases outside @entity17 and @entity18			1
to date , @entity20 province and @entity22 district have been considered as two likely locations for operations centers outside of @entity17 and @entity18			1
@entity25 reported last week that the military was preparing plans to deploy @entity9 advisers to @entity20 , much of which is under the control of @entity5			2
" the president took these decisions at the request of the @entity2 government and upon the recommendation of @entity37 and his military commanders based upon the assessed needs of the @entity40 , " the statement said			2
" we believe this request is an opportunity for @entity12 and this administration to work together to provide the additional resources needed to degrade and ultimately defeat @entity5 and i look forward to working with @entity12 to secure this funding , " said @entity41 , @entity0 's budget director			1
the budget request marks an early test for cooperation between @entity0 and congressional leaders following the @entity53 rout in this week 's midterm elections that reshaped @entity56 's balance of power			2
it includes $ 1.6 billion to establish a fund to develop and support @entity2 and @entity4 security forces as they gear up to mount a counter offensive against @entity5 , which has carved out a so - called caliphate in vast swathes of @entity2 and @entity63			1
the requests are based on an assessment of @entity2 security forces made by @entity67 , said @entity69 spokesman , rear admiral @entity68			1
@entity67 will set up training centers for nine @entity2 army and three @entity73 brigades , @entity68 said			2
he said that @entity0 took the decision to go ahead and almost double the number of trainers and advisers following a request from the @entity2 government of prime minister @entity80			1
he said that the mission was possible because @entity2 forces , which were built with billions of dollars in @entity9 funding , and partially folded in the face of the @entity5 advance , had " stiffened " their spines			1
" we are going in at the request of the @entity2 government			2
we are wanted there , " said @entity68 " there is a very acute threat that is facing the @entity2 people and the @entity2 government			0
" the @entity10 has insisted that the @entity9 operation against @entity5 will not include " boots on the ground			0
" but the new announcement by an administration that made ending foreign wars a core of its foreign policy is likely to fuel new concerns of " mission creep " among the president 's critics			0
but @entity106 , @entity107 minority whip , told @entity25 's " the lead with @entity110 " that he would back the funding			0
" i do n't think this is mission creep , " he said			0
a @entity53 congressional source complained that the administration had not formally briefed senior lawmakers on @entity115 over the new funding and troop request			0
@entity119 ' @entity118 , chairman of the @entity120 , said that he would consider the request , but warned that the president 's strategy to combat @entity5 was insufficient			0
" i would urge the president to reconsider his strategy and clearly explain how this additional funding supports a new direction			0
such clarity is more likely to find swift congressional approval , " he said in a statement			0
the top @entity9 military commander in the fight against @entity5 insisted on thursday that airstrikes are working to erode the radical @entity136 group 's capabilities			1
@entity137 : the @entity5 terror threat " i 'm confident we 're having the desired effects , " said @entity140 gen. @entity139			0
he said that @entity5 fighters were afraid to congregate in any sizable formation in @entity63 and @entity2 amid fears they could be target by @entity9 and allied aircraft			1
a senior @entity9 defense official meanwhile told @entity25 this week that the administration had not ruled out expanding the war in @entity63 to another radical group , the @entity148 affilitated @entity153			0
such a move would be intended to repel its advances against moderate @entity63 rebels on which @entity56 has anchored its strategy of battling @entity5 .			0

@entity0 will send up to 1,500 troops to @entity2
the troops will be in *non-combat* roles and operate from bases outside @entity17 and @entity18
the troops will help train @entity2 and @entity4 forces to fight @entity5
