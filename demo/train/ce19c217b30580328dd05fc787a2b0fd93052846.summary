did president @entity0 do the right thing when he agreed to trade @entity3 leaders in exchange for @entity5 ? the issue has become a weapon in the partisan political arsenal and it will surely join the @entity10 incident in election season			1
and yet , the @entity5 deal is something quite different			1
when @entity0 approved the release of dangerous , top - value @entity17 prisoners in exchange for an @entity20 soldier captured under mysterious circumstances , he negotiated a tangle of competing moral principles			1
if it were possible to wrestle with these issues in a nonpartisan way , the country might gain from this difficult experience			2
the @entity5 - @entity3 trade will be discussed in ethics classes for years to come			1
here are some of the hard questions : 1 ) @entity20 holds two principles high on its moral agenda			1
first , the @entity20 does not leave any of its soldiers behind in the battlefield			1
second , the @entity20 does not negotiate with terrorists			2
but what happens when the two principles collide ? which matters more ? @entity0 has made his position clear : " we do n't leave men and women in uniform behind			1
" the administration argues it did not negotiate with terrorists			2
and although the @entity20 does not classify the @entity3 as a terrorist organization , the @entity3 , including those released in the deal , have worked with @entity49 and have had a major role in killing thousands of civilians			2
@entity55 , for example , according to secret @entity20 documents released by @entity53 , was " directly associated " with @entity56			2
@entity58 , according to @entity57 , presided over the killing of thousands of @entity60			0
a transaction that frees members of a shadowy organization lends the group prestige			0
it invigorates it and sends the message that taking prisoners ultimately pays			0
the @entity20 broke one of its rules			0
the two rules were mutually exclusive			0
the @entity20 had to break one in choosing a path through this moral dilemma			0
2 ) does the rule of " leave no one behind " apply to deserters ? we do n't know much about how @entity5 came to become a prisoner			1
but many of his comrades in the field say @entity5 walked away from his post by choice			1
he reportedly emailed his father before leaving , " the future is too good to waste on lies " and left a note in his tent saying he was leaving , according to the @entity90			2
soldiers say six @entity20 died trying to find him after he left			2
if that is true , does the " leave no one " rule still apply to him ? @entity0 says : " we still get an @entity20 soldier back if he is held in captivity			1
we do n't condition that			0
" it 's an unsettling decision , particularly for the relatives of those who may have died trying to save him			0
but the rule sends a message to other @entity20 soldiers that their country takes this solemn commitment very seriously			0
if @entity5 is a deserter , he should face justice on that count			1
if his desertion caused @entity20 such an awful price , he -- and the country -- will have to live with that			0
3 ) does the life of one man we know warrant losing the lives of many whom we do n't know ? there is an ugly truth hanging over any prisoner exchange with an active enemy : it saves one life , but it is likely to cost many more			1
if the trade were a simple mathematical calculation , it would make no sense			0
the @entity20 says 17 % , perhaps as many as 29 % , of those released from @entity17 have turned to terrorism			0
the predicament is familiar to @entity138 , which has released thousands of convicted prisoners in lopsided trades for a handful of @entity138 , even for the bodies of @entity138 killed by their captors			1
the decision is wrenching even when the soldier gaining his freedom was captured through no fault of his own			0
in 2011 , @entity138 traded 1,027 palestinians , including many convicted in terrorist attacks that killed scores of civilians , in exchange for @entity153 , who had been held by @entity154 for five years			1
by then , @entity138 statistics already showed that terrorists freed in exchange for 19 @entity138 over the years had gone on to kill 182 more			1
still , they went ahead with the deal , and the public supported it			2
@entity153 had become an @entity138 icon , everyone 's child			1
but the fact is that one person , with a name , a family , a face , somehow takes more value than other nameless ones who may die later as the result of the trade			2
4 ) if a person should be saved , what cost is too high ? is there a limit ? just how much is one @entity20 soldier worth ? as far as we know , the deal with @entity5 brought five of the top @entity3 leaders to freedom -- although they are supposed to remain in @entity182 for one year			1
other countries have paid large amounts of cash as ransom to free their citizens			0
the price is not only the amount exchanged at the moment of the trade			0
it is also what happens with that currency whether it 's people or money			0
unrest in parts of @entity198 , which has left hundreds , perhaps thousands dead , was financed in part by ransom money paid by various governments			2
5 ) if a prisoner exchange is politically costly but morally correct , should a politician support it ? @entity0 must have known there would be political fallout			1
@entity209 , too , is lending measured support to the trade			0
none of these is an easy question			0
each country answers them in the light of its own values and priorities			0
@entity20 would do well to examine them in a nonpolitical way , as a crafting of the nation 's beliefs , and a guide for making moral choices in the future			0
who was swapped for @entity5 ?			1

@entity230 : @entity0 dealt with *reconciling* " no deal with terrorists , " " no one left behind "
@entity235 : another issue : if @entity5 left his post , does " leave no one behind " apply to deserters ?
she asks : what cost is too high in saving a *hostage* ? @entity138 contended with this many times
@entity235 : does the life of one person we know warrant losing others we might not know ?
