-- up until very recently , conventional wisdom held that shipping was a minor player in terms of greenhouse gas emissions			1
that all changed in october last year			0
leaked details of a report by the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) got into the press , and revealed an uncomfortable truth about the shipping industry -- its emissions could be double the amount everyone previously believed			1
ships emit twice as much greenhouse gases as planes , according to at least one report			0
and that would make it 's carbon footprint double that of the aviation industry			2
the aviation industry emits around 650 million tons of greenhouse gases every year , representing around 3 percent of the global total			1
if the leaked documents from research submitted for the @entity31 report are to be believed , the shipping industry 's contribution is more than twice the amount previously believed ( 600 million tons ) -- which would mean ships emit as much as 1.2 billion tons of greenhouse gases a year			1
that would mean ships contribute between 5 percent and 6 percent of all the world 's greenhouse gases			2
to put that in perspective , according to law firm @entity41 there are only six countries in the world with greater carbon dioxide emissions than the shipping industry : the @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
quick facts about the shipping industry : ships consume at least 2 billion barrels of oil a year ; they emit 20 percent of all sulphur dioxide emissions ; 30 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions ; as much as 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide ; ships are responsible for at least 60,000 pollution - related deaths a year in addition to contributing to global warming , the airborne particles ships release from burning fuel ( which is less refined than plane fuel ) have been responsible for a high number of land - based premature deaths			1
a report by the @entity72 believes at least 60,000 people die each year from lung or heart failure , caused by airborne particles small enough to enter the blood			0
they believe that number will increase by 40 percent by 2012			2
the people who may be getting it worse are those who live near the world 's ports			0
a recent study by @entity84 suggests that a single cruise liner stopping off at a port can emit as much greenhouse gas as 12,400 cars during its stay there			0
( it is suggesting a system whereby docking ships can " plug in " to the local electricity grid which , they say , would slash smokestack emissions by nearly 100 percent			1
) global trade pushes shipping the reason the shipping industry 's carbon footprint is so large is essentially because of global trade			1
at least 90 percent of all global trade is served by the shipping industry			1
why ? because ships can carry a whole lot more stuff than planes , making them a much more cost - effective means of transporting goods			0
as a result , while the aviation industry transports around 40 million tons of freight a year , the shipping industry carries 6 billion tons of it			1
ships carry products over a collective distance of 6 million kilometers ( 3.7 million miles ) every year			0
it 's not so surprising then why they get through so much fuel			0
in 2001 alone , they gobbled up as much as 280 millions tons of it			2
that 's more than twice as much fuel as the entire aviation industry gets through ( 130 million tons ) a year -- and twice as much as @entity49 uses up			1
some believe a virtuous circle has been created by advances in shipping technology and the explosion in international trade			1
the opening statement of a 2005 report issued by the @entity134 's @entity133 is quite revealing in this regard : " the study confirms what was already known			0
the adaptability of regular cargo shipping lines and advances in technology -- mainly containerization -- have accompanied or even encouraged the vigorous growth in the trade of manufactured goods and the transfer of their production to regions and countries offering significant comparative advantages , mainly in terms of labor costs			2
" in short , as more goods get made in poorer countries , there will be more need to transport them to their customer markets around the world			0
the increase in the global transfer of goods will therefore dictate the levels of ships ' fuel consumption , and therefore their negative impact on the environment as well			2
by 2020 some estimates put the amount of fuel ships will need at as high as 400 million tons -- just to sustain the increase in business they receive from the growth in global trade			1
if nothing is done to come up with cleaner ways to power ships , maritime emissions could balloon by as much as 75 percent within that same time period , some estimates go			1
so how come ships have fallen below the radar for so long ? some believe the reason has a lot to do with an imbalance of public pressure , which has traditionally focused on cars and planes			0
the thinking goes , most people know who the airlines and car makers are , while they would be hard - pressed to name the world 's largest ocean shipping company ( it 's @entity201 's @entity200 )			2
others , like @entity203 say it has been difficult to regulate the shipping industry because " international law limits the ability of coastal nations to impose and enforce their own environmental and navigational regulations on foreign ships passing through their waters "			1
for this reason , it says , countries have traditionally followed conventions set by international organizations such as the @entity219			0
but @entity203 argues the beaurocratic processes involved in these types of international bodies can mean issues take an unnecessarily long time to resolve ( neither aviation nor shipping is included in the @entity227 , for example , and discussions to include these two polluting industries in the follow - up agreement to @entity232 are only happening now )			2
essentially , the only countries that tend to push issues are the ones that are directly impacted			0
and that means even if issues are recognized early on , until enough interested countries push the agenda , those attempting to bring these issues to global attention remain lone voices			0
as the @entity203 points out on its web site : " it was only after the single - hulled @entity245 went down off the coast of @entity247 in 1989 that the @entity47 introduced a phase - out of these old tankers ... it took the sinking of the single - hulled @entity252 ten years later off the coast of @entity254 for the member states of the @entity219 to accelerate the global phase - out to match that of the @entity47			0
" however law firm , @entity41 believes nations could do a whole lot more to enforce both international rules when ships dock at their ports , as well as introducing their own rules			0
to that effect it has recently filed a petition , on behalf of a number of environmental @entity268 , with the @entity47 @entity269 ( @entity269 ) to pressure it to enforce stricter rules on both @entity47 and foreign - owned ships stopping off at its ports			1
@entity41 says the @entity269 does , in fact , have legal authority once ships come within 200 miles of the country 's coastline , so it can enforce its own strict pollution standards on ships , regardless of whether they are locally or foreign - owned			2
the ngos involved essentially wants to see stricter rules on fuel efficiency as well as the use of cleaner fuels			0
@entity284 , one of the environmental groups petitioning the @entity269 is warning that if nothing is done , " shipping pollution will increase substantially , potentially doubling from 2002 levels by 2020 and tripling by 2030			1
" e-mail to a friend ( sources : @entity293 ; @entity284 ; @entity219 ; @entity294 ; @entity133 ; sustainable shipping ; @entity296 ; @entity297 ; @entity41 ; @entity203 ; @entity134 ; @entity84 )			0

shipping industry more *harmful* than previously thought
estimates put emissions at as much as 1.2 billion tons
more than 90 percent of global trade served by shipping industry
more regulation needed , say environmental groups suing @entity269
