-- @entity4 teams may try to take control of the elite motorsport when the rights agreement expires at the end of 2012 , @entity2 president @entity1 told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			1
@entity10 has run @entity4 on behalf of @entity11 since selling his rights in 2006 , but speculation is growing that the @entity14 -- the settlement between the private equity firm and the teams -- will not be renewed			1
last month , media mogul @entity20 's @entity19 and @entity22 investment firm @entity18 released a statement confirming they were " formulating a long - term plan for the development of @entity4 in the interests of the participants and the fans			1
" @entity1 said that the teams had three options : to renew with @entity11 ; find a new partner ; or follow the lead of basketball 's @entity33 and create their own company to run the sport			1
would @entity4 be better off with different owners ? " i think we have to be very pragmatic			1
at the end of 2012 , the contracts of every single team with @entity11 will expire			1
so , we have three alternatives , " the 63 - year - old @entity22 told @entity0			1
" we renew with @entity11 , or we theoretically -- as the basketball teams did in the @entity45 with great success -- we create our own company , like the @entity33			1
just to run the races , the tv rights and so			1
" and third , to find a different partner			0
@entity10 did a very good job but he has already sold out three times , so he does n't own the business anymore			0
it is @entity11 that will sell			1
it will be the teams ' decisions			2
" at the end of 2012 , the contract will expire , so theoretically @entity11 does n't own anything			1
i think it is important to have alternatives			0
we have time to do it			0
" @entity20 's @entity66 finds partner for potential @entity4 bid @entity1 hopes to continue the expansion that @entity10 helped to usher in			1
" we have to invest in the @entity45 we have to improve new technologies in @entity4 for the people watching the television , for @entity73 , for the @entity74			2
so i think we are in front of a very important moment , " he said			0
" we will race in @entity78 and @entity79			0
@entity4 , thanks also to @entity10 , has become a worldwide sport			2
now we have to find the best solution			0
it is important to invest for the future and the other teams			2
" @entity85 is adamant that @entity4 needs a new direction , and claims that rule changes in recent years have made the sport confusing for the teams and fans alike			1
latest f1 championship standings " we have gone too far with artificial elements			0
it 's like , if i push footballers to wear tennis shoes in the rain			2
to have so many pit - stops -- listen , i want to see competition , i want to see cars on the track			2
i do n't want to see competition in the pits , " he said			2
" a little bit , yes -- but in the last race there were 80 pit - stops			0
come on , it 's too much			0
and the people do n't understand anymore because when you come out of the pits you do n't know what position you 're in			0
" i think we have gone too far with the machines , too many buttons			0
the driver is focalizing the buttons , when you have the authorization to overtake			0
we have gone too far			0
" @entity2 will push a lot with the authority -- with the respect that we have to the federation and the other teams -- to avoid going too far with @entity4			1
because i think it can create problems for the television people and on the racetrack			0
" @entity128 : @entity2 have been too conservative this season @entity1 admitted he was frustrated with the present limits on testing too			1
" we are not able to do testing , to do training			0
@entity4 is only professional sport in the world where you ca n't train or test , " he said .			2
