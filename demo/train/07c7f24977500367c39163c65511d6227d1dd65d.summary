-- she 'd spent all year hoping to win her first @entity2 , but @entity3 has bounced back from last month 's crushing disappointment			1
the @entity6 golfer claimed her fifth major title on sunday , retaining her @entity8 after once again going to a playoff			1
she needed three extra holes to win at @entity11 last year , but this time one was enough as the 26 - year - old ended @entity14 @entity13 's hopes of a second major success			1
" it was a very tough tournament to forget , since i was so close and i thought i was definitely able to do it , " @entity3 said of the @entity2 , where she led going into the final round but faded to 10th after a 77			1
" that 's been the tournament that i 've really waited for all year long , and that 's been my only goal this year			1
and not being able to do it in the final round was very disappointing			0
" it gives me a little bit of break from the @entity2 and i can kind of forget about it a little bit and kind of move on now			2
" this time @entity3 came from behind , having been tied for second a shot adrift of 61st - ranked @entity13 going into the fourth round			2
she birdied the 17th and sank a 15 - foot par putt at the last , while @entity13 three - putted 18 to ensure a playoff -- and then bogeyed as they played it again			0
it was world @entity40 's second playoff in as many weeks , having lost to tour rookie compatriot @entity41 at the @entity42 in @entity43			2
she claimed her second tournament win this year -- which has inevitably paled into comparison with last year 's feats , when she won the season 's opening three majors plus three other @entity52 events			1
" this year was always going to be a tough year after having such a great year last year , " @entity3 told reporters			1
" you know , i feel like so far this season i 've really handled myself well in this position , and it feels like i 've played some good golf			0
and i played very consistently this year			0
i just sometimes did n't get that lucky as last year			0
sometimes i just did n't putt as well			0
" for the 28 - year - old @entity13 , it was her best finish at a major since winning the @entity62 -- and she wept tears of joy at the finish , despite her playoff disappointment			1
" i really feel like this will be the stepping stone that i kind of needed to push me to keep it going and to be in the top 10 each week like i was three years ago , " she said			0
teenager @entity70 , ranked second in the world , finished third on eight under overall , three shots back from the leading duo			0
the 17 - year - old @entity74 bogeyed the last two holes , but sealed her best finish at a major			2
@entity78 's @entity77 oz tied for fourth with @entity80 @entity79 , while world no. 1 @entity81 was equal sixth in a group including @entity41 and @entity85 's 2007 winner @entity84 -- who had been tied for second with @entity87 before closing with 76			0
meanwhile , on the men 's @entity90 , @entity89 's @entity88 clinched his place in the @entity94 playoffs with victory at the @entity96 on sunday			1
the 32 - year - old earned his first title since 2010 as his final - round seven - under 63 left him one shot clear of @entity14 @entity100 ( 64 ) and @entity101 ( 66 )			2
the former world no. 12 had tumbled to 254th in the rankings ahead of the tournament , but goes into the playoffs 37th in the @entity14 tour 's standings after leaping 68 places on the money list with the $ 954,000 first prize .			0

@entity3 wins her fifth major title with playoff win at @entity115
@entity6 retains her title , having also won at a playoff last year
she says her victory , at first extra hole , makes up for @entity124 @entity2 disappointment
@entity89 's @entity88 heads into men 's @entity94 playoffs with victory
