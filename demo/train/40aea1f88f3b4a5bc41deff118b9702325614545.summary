-- @entity1 is front - page news again			1
what did she do to warrant this treatment ? nothing			2
the @entity7 splash in the @entity8 the other day was a nicely executed compilation of ... sheer speculation			2
that is , the same sort of chatter that everyone in the political / media world has engaged in since the day after @entity17 's re-election			1
and it immediately launched dozens of cable news segments to rehash the rehash			1
what explains this ? whatever happened to having to generate a little news , or even pseudo-news , to warrant some coverage ? watch : did @entity27 control damage with @entity30 / @entity29 spoof ? the answers , in no particular order : -- it 's @entity1			1
which means clicks and ratings			2
-- things are slowww right now			2
-- covering the legislative drip - drip - drip over immigration and gun control is boring ; handicapping the 2016 race is easy , fun and nonfattening			0
-- it 's another excuse to write about @entity44			1
-- the media love @entity1 and are not - so - subtly rooting for her to run			1
first woman president and all that			0
watch : what ? @entity49 grad urges female students to find husbands now there 's no denying the obvious : @entity53 would be a prohibitive front - runner			1
most @entity55 hope she 'll make a @entity58 run			0
she would probably be a strong general - election contender , given the @entity60 's disarray , especially after honing her foreign - policy chops as secretary of state			1
so how did the @entity8 story advance the dialogue ? let 's see : -- @entity53 has n't made up her mind			1
-- her spokesman says she has n't made up her mind			0
friends say she 's ambivalent			1
-- lots of donors would give her money if she ran			0
-- other democrats are hamstrung , waiting to see what she 'll do			0
-- she will be 69 when the next election rolls around			0
-- she has n't issued a shermanesque statement against running			0
( see ? ! ) -- oh , and she has a half - dozen staffers working for her at a transition office while she gets ready to give big - money speeches			0
watch : not rocket science -- @entity8 defends sexist obit the coverage seems a bit myopic to me			1
@entity1 is incredibly popular right now in part because she 's had diplomatic immunity for the past four years			1
except for the aftermath of the fatal attack on the @entity95 @entity94 in @entity96 , @entity97 -- and the trumped - up fiction about her suffering from " @entity96 flu " -- she has managed to stay out of politics during her tenure at @entity103			0
now that @entity53 is a private citizen , she can steer clear of the crossfire for a couple of years while building her brand and her bank account			0
the moment she lets it be known that she 's running , if she does , the @entity60 attack machine and conservative media complex will begin beating her up			1
that reminds me of a reality that seems to have faded into the ether			0
@entity53 royally botched her campaign last time around			0
she blew a 30 - point lead to a freshman senator , allowed massive staff infighting and failed to fully compete in the caucus states			0
that does n't mean she wo n't learn from her mistakes , but it 's hardly an insignificant fact			2
watch : why @entity124 will be missed when she retires when @entity53 , barely out of the @entity126 , made a video endorsing same - sex marriage , it was a clear sign that she 's at least keeping her options open for 2016			1
but there was barely a skeptical note in the press : why was she changing her stance now , when it was politically safe for a @entity135 , from 2008 , when such a move would have been courageous ? i would n't bet a ton of money against @entity53 being the next @entity55 nominee , but the 33 months between now and the @entity141 caucuses is a political lifetime			2
who would have picked @entity17 to win in april of 2005 ? a @entity8 story from that month had @entity144 predicting that @entity53 would be the nominee and " very formidable			2
" and any @entity1 health problems , of course , could scramble the equation			1
the latest @entity8 piece is just the beginning			0
the political press will plow this ground again and again until the former first lady makes up her mind			0
but keep in mind that the media do n't get to conduct a coronation			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			1

@entity160 : @entity1 getting media coverage without generating any real news
media find it easier to do speculative stories about @entity1 than *ongoing* issues , he says
she *'d* be a great nominee , but she 's still not talking , he says ; so where 's the news ?
@entity160 : she 's seems to be keeping her options open
