@entity0 will never forget the sound that echoed around @entity2 from the pitcher 's mound on a saturday afternoon last june			1
more than a year after the pitcher 's then - @entity6 teammate @entity5 was struck in the head by a concussing line drive , that sound of ball on skull still resonates			1
" i came in after @entity5 was hit in the head , " @entity0 told @entity13 on sunday			2
" that 's really an impression to me , how his head sounded from the bullpen			0
' oh my @entity20 ! oh my @entity20 ! ' i 'm glad he 's alive			0
" @entity6 pitcher struck by line drive released from hospital until saturday , the most notable thing about @entity0 ' brief 74 - game @entity26 career was that the reliever , traded from @entity6 to the @entity29 over the past year , had struck out more than a batter per inning			1
but years from now , we might look back at the unheralded , undrafted pitcher as one of the game 's pioneers			2
when the 26 - year - old @entity37 strolled from the bullpen to the mound for the eighth inning of saturday night 's game against the @entity42 , he became the first pitcher to wear a protective cap that @entity26 approved in january for use by pitchers			1
" it 's a good idea they make this kind of hat to protect my head , " @entity0 said			1
" you want to protect life			0
i do n't have a kid yet , but i want to see my kid grow up			0
" @entity56 makes the new @entity57 , which its website describes as " breakthrough technology to protect @entity26 pitchers from line drive come - backers			1
" the optional equipment was made available to pitchers at all levels during spring training , with interested players providing information so they could get fitted caps , @entity62 reported			0
line drives back to the mound have caused several injuries to pitchers over the past few years , some very serious			1
most recently , the @entity77 ' star closer @entity75 sat out the first six weeks of this season after a line drive in spring training caused fractures to his nose and above his left eye			1
in the most life - threatening incident , @entity85 @entity84 , then pitching for the @entity86 , took a batted ball to the head in september 2012 , then needed brain surgery because of internal bleeding			2
the protective caps have padding imbedded inside the side and front			1
however , the portion of the head below the cap line , where @entity62 says many of the more seriously injured pitchers were struck , remains unprotected			2
" the cap is fitted with uniquely - formulated protective plates that use a combination of dispersion and absorption techniques to diffuse energy upon impact with a high - velocity object , " the @entity57 website says			2
" under rigorous testing simulating @entity26 line drives , the @entity110 cap demonstrated protection at speeds up to 90 mph in the front and front boss impact locations and 85 mph on the side impact location			1
" @entity119 , @entity26 's executive vice president for labor relations , and @entity122 , @entity26 senior counsel for labor relations , told @entity124 in january that to get approval , the cap had to provide protection at 83 miles per hour , below the @entity127 standard severity index of 1,200			1
severity indexes higher than 1,200 are considered high - risk for skull fractures and traumatic brain injuries			0
an @entity26 - commissioned study determined that 83 mph was the average speed of a line drive when it reaches the area of the pitching mound , @entity124 reported			1
player safety in sports has risen to the forefront in recent years , sparked by increased awareness of the repercussions of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy , as well as high - profile player lawsuits against the @entity144			2
first @entity26 player diagnosed with @entity146 all four major @entity148 pro sports leagues -- @entity26 , the @entity144 , the @entity149 and the @entity150 -- have updated their concussion protocols in recent years			1
eighteen baseball players were placed on the disabled list after concussions in 2013			0
in 2012 , 13 players were placed on the list after a concussion , and in 2011 , the number was 11 , according to @entity26 data			2
the padding adds 7 ounces to the weight of a cap , which currently weighs 3 to 4 ounces , according to @entity62			0
although the caps look bulky , " the difference between a regular hat [ and the new one ] is not a big difference			0
it 's a little bigger than the regular one , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 said the larger cap does n't interfere with his pitching motion , and he practiced with the new cap on for three or four days over the past week before using it in the @entity42 game , to make sure it would n't bother him			1
while a lot of internet response has been supportive , many people online have been making fun of @entity0 ' sartorial choice			0
the @entity29 ' lefty said even a former teammate , @entity6 ' star @entity181 , was tweaking him on social media			0
but he does n't care , possessing the confidence to choose safety over style			0
it is n't quite as formfitting and as chic as the baseball cap , " the @entity29 announcers said during the telecast			2
" obviously , the appearance has to change , because a lot of players these days , you can see , they want to look the part			0
they want to look really good , and that is not a good look			0
" while @entity0 does n't think the protective caps should be mandatory for major leagues , he urges parents and children to consider them , because of a key difference between the majors and youth baseball			1
" i think [ children ] should be using [ the caps ] because they use aluminum [ bats ] , and the ball comes off the aluminum harder than the bat we are using , " he said .			0

@entity29 pitcher @entity0 is the first @entity26 player to wear a new protective cap in a game
@entity26 approved the new caps , produced by @entity56 , in january
@entity56 says caps protect against line drives up to 85 mph on the side and 90 mph in front
an @entity26 - commissioned study says average line drive to pitching mound travels 83 mph
