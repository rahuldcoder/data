the grizzly bears that claim this park as their home demand respect			1
they 're emblems of a tough and inspiring untamed wilderness			0
so is the @entity6 , which rises 7,000 feet above the valley at @entity8 , amazing and humbling the day trippers and overnight campers who come to visit @entity12 's expansive @entity11			1
while @entity11 is the highest peak at 13,770 feet , there are eight peaks more than 12,000 feet in elevation			1
the forested mountainsides provide some relief to summer hikers			0
the current - day park has existed since 1950 , when @entity11 ( created in 1929 ) and @entity21 ( created in 1943 ) were combined under the @entity11 name			1
in 1972 , the @entity23 was established and is now managed by the park staff			2
@entity11 stats : @entity11 is the eighth most visited @entity11 in the country with 2.7 million visitors last year			1
( @entity28 came in first place with 9.7 million visitors			2
) the park 's boundaries encompass 310,000 acres or 485 square miles			1
@entity33 : @entity28 the location : @entity11 is located north of the town of @entity36 and south of @entity38 in northwestern @entity12			1

meet our ranger : in 1993 @entity51 worked a summer job at @entity53 in @entity54 to pay for college			0
he got hooked on the national parks			0
the next summer , he decided he wanted bigger mountains , so he went to work at @entity11			1
although he was first hired permanently at @entity28 , he finally made it back to @entity11 in 2000			1
he worked for eight years as a " @entity61 " crew member ( and later , 10 years as a trail crew supervisor ) , building and clearing hiking trails and building log and steel bridges and stone retaining walls by hand			0
the crews would sometimes hike 30 miles a day , carrying and using cross cuts , chainsaws and other equipment			0
he 's served as the park 's safety and occupational health manager for the past two years			1
camping : horror or bliss ? for a day trip , do n't miss : @entity78			1
" there are often several large bull moose in the canyon , and during spring and after storms many waterfalls cascade down the canyon sides , " @entity51 says			2
" the views of the peaks are constantly changing also , and it is right by @entity88 , the most popular place in the park and readily accessible			2
" if you have a little more time and want a challenging hike , @entity51 recommends an overnight hike of @entity95 and paintbrush canyons			2
it 's a nearly 20 - mile loop that includes a 4,000 - foot gain in elevation			2
( you 'll need a backcountry permit , which are available first - come , first - served for the rest of this season			0
) in addition to the wonders of the day hike , you 'll see " some amazing sunsets and incredibly clear and vivid star - gazing , " he says			0
" it 's not for the faint of heart , but it blows me away , and i 've hiked all over the world			2
" favorite less - traveled spot : @entity117 trail and summit			2
" it is less busy than many other areas of the park , has great views of the @entity6 and the forest to the east and is a relatively short hike , " he says			0
" it is densely forested , too , so it 's good for shade on a hot summer day			0
" it 's just 0.7 miles from the trailhead to the summit and a 4 - mile loop , but @entity51 warns that the steep 15 % grade can be tough on the knees			0
favorite spot to view wildlife : @entity51 recommends @entity139 because of the plentiful moose and beavers and , increasingly , grizzly bears			1
( it 's occasionally closed because of the grizzlies			0
) he also likes the @entity146 to @entity145 bend section of the outer highway for grizzly bears , pelicans , elk and beaver			1
most magical moment in the park : his first day of work at @entity11 , as a summer employee			1
" driving to @entity11 at 2 a.m. for my first day of work in may of 1994 , i was blown away at the night sky and all the stars			1
on the first day of work , i built horse pasture fences all day surrounded by bison and had no sunscreen			0
i was totally fried by the end of the day			0
blisters , sunburn and bison : it was the best first day ever			0
" favorite other park to visit : @entity170 in @entity171			0
" it 's great for hiking and canyoneering , for off - trail exploration and for the incredibly beautiful rocks , " @entity51 says			0
" the waterfalls after a storm are amazing			0
it 's just like @entity178 ( another favorite ) but a little more remote so there are n't as many people			1
