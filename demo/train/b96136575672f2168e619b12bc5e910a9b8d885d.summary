-- lawyers for a group of gay and lesbian couples in @entity4 have asked the @entity5 to allow same - sex marriages to continue in the state , following a federal judge 's ruling that found a law there banning the practice unconstitutional			1
justice @entity13 issued an emergency injunction on tuesday , but was expected to issue an order as early as friday afternoon on whether to grant the state 's request for an injunction to temporarily halt same - sex unions			1
@entity21 district judge @entity20 struck down the statute as unconstitutional on december 20 , and the state then asked the high court to block enforcement of that decision			0
@entity20 said the law " conflicts with the @entity29 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law			0
" the issue on enforcement is tricky since hundreds of marriage licenses have already been issued by some @entity4 counties in the nearly two weeks since the decision was announced			0
voters there approved a law banning same - sex marriage in 2004			0
any action from the high court on the enforcement question would be temporary and not offer the final word on the constitutionality of the state 's ban on same - sex marriage			1
a @entity52 - based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks , but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to continue .			2

@entity5 @entity13 issued injunction on tuesday
@entity4 *sought* *relief* from lower court ruling allowing same - sex marriages
any @entity5 action would be temporary as appeals continue to play out
