@entity0 -- a leading @entity3 conservative said sunday he can accept tax reform that increases overall tax revenue as part of a comprehensive deficit reduction plan			1
@entity10 sen. @entity9 of @entity11 told the @entity13 program " @entity14 " that if lowering tax rates and eliminating loopholes and deductions ended up bringing in more money to the @entity20 government , " that would be fine with me			1
" asked about a pledge he signed previously against any kind of tax increase , @entity9 said his more important pledge was to do what 's best for the country			1
he also noted that political reality dictated the need for bipartisan support for any agreement to pass			0
" this is n't about politics as normal , " @entity9 said			2
" it 's about making a decision now that is urgent			0
" @entity9 is one of six senators taking part in bipartisan talks on a deficit reduction blueprint			1
while they have yet to reach final agreement , the senators participating in the so - called " @entity41 " want their work to serve as an impetus for both sides to meet somewhere in the middle on the deficit reduction issue			1
another member of the @entity3 negotiators , @entity49 chairman @entity48 of @entity50 , told reporters that increased revenue must be part of a deficit reduction plan			2
as an example of the tax reform under discussion , @entity48 told reporters the plan would limit the mortgage interest deduction to a maximum of $ 500,000 worth of mortgage and only on a principal residence , not a second home			2
under current law , the amount of mortgage held by a married couple eligible for interest deduction is $ 1 million , and that can apply to a second home			0
the deficit reduction debate is central to two key spending issues coming up before @entity76 -- increasing the amount of money the government can borrow , and passing a federal budget for fiscal year 2012 , which begins october 1			2
the @entity20 debt is expected to hit the country 's $ 14.3 trillion ceiling next month , though congressional leaders say the @entity86 can take steps to put off the deadline until early july			0
conservative @entity10 are demanding significant deficit reduction steps attached to the debt ceiling measure before they 'll vote for it			1
" i will vote ' no ' on raising the debt ceiling unless we have comprehensive , dramatic , effective and broad - based cuts to federal spending , including the reform of entitlement spending , " sen. @entity93 , @entity94 , said on the @entity96 program " @entity14			1
" president @entity103 and @entity105 leaders oppose linking the debt ceiling measure to political issues , warning that a failure to raise the debt limit would amount to a @entity20 default that would shake global markets , raise interest rates and stall or reverse economic recovery			1
" we will raise the debt ceiling because the alternative , as every expert economist agrees , would be catastrophic for our economy , for our credibility around the world , for the bond markets and for the world economy , " @entity105 sen. @entity114 of @entity115 told @entity96			1
" so i think the only question is really whether raising the debt ceiling will be tied to spending reductions			2
" however , @entity9 and @entity10 rep. @entity10 of @entity126 , a @entity127 conservative elected last november , rejected the @entity105 argument that the debt ceiling must be raised , saying the government has enough money to pay its debt obligations , at least for a few months			1
" it 's being overstated , " @entity134 , speaking on the @entity96 program , said of @entity105 warnings of potential economic catastrophe			0
" three or four times over the course of the last 20 years , @entity76 has voted not to raise the debt ceiling , and it 's taken a few months and then they 've come together and they 've raised it , " @entity134 said			2
" but over the course of those few months when the debt ceiling was n't raised , @entity141 did n't hit			2
the government paid its bills			0
we 've got enough government revenues to certainly pay -- to service all of our debt			0
and the administration knows that			0
" so far , @entity150 @entity10 have passed a 2012 budget proposal that would slash nonmilitary spending and overhaul @entity153 and @entity154 while lowering tax rates with no revenue increase			1
the @entity10 plan drafted by @entity159 chairman @entity158 of @entity160 would cut deficits by more than $ 4 trillion over 10 years			0
@entity103 and @entity105 reject the @entity10 plan as an imbalanced approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on senior citizens and the poor			1
instead , @entity103 proposes cutting deficits by $ 4 billion over 12 years through cuts in both military and discretionary spending , increasing the tax burden on families making more than $ 250,000 a year and adjusting the @entity153 and @entity154 government - run health care systems for the elderly and the poor			0
the @entity41 negotiations focus on a deficit reduction plan compiled last year by a commission appointed by @entity103 that calls for increased revenue through tax reform , spending cuts in all areas and reforms to all the entitlement programs			1
asked if the @entity3 talks were approaching a consensus , @entity48 told @entity13 : " if we do n't have an agreement soon , we wo n't be relevant to this discussion			0
" we intend to be relevant , " he said , adding : " we have made enormous progress in this group , and it is the only bipartisan effort that is under way			0
and at the end of the day , it has to be bipartisan or nothing is going to happen			0
" @entity1 's @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this story .			0
