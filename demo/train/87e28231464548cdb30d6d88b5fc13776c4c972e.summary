" the status quo is no longer acceptable			1
" that 's the message the @entity2 is trying to send its students and others after a scathing @entity7 story detailed allegations of a gang rape at a fraternity party , and the school 's supposed indifference toward students who are victims of sexual assault			1
the horrific attack reportedly happened to a woman known only as @entity16 , at the start of her freshman year in 2012			0
she told the magazine she was raped by seven men at @entity21 , while two more gave encouragement			2
the school stands accused of bungling its response to the assault , and sweeping other assault allegations under the rug			2
" to @entity16 and her parents , i say i am sorry , " @entity29 @entity28 said at an emergency meeting of @entity2 's governing board this week			1
" to the survivors of sexual assault and their families , i am also sorry			0
" he added : " this type of conduct will not be tolerated at the @entity2			1
the status quo is no longer acceptable			1
" the board unanimously adopted a resolution affirming a zero - tolerance approach toward rape and sexual assault cases			1
what exactly that means remains to be seen			0
the actual specifics of the new policy will be worked out later , university officials said			1
@entity2 suspended all fraternities until after the winter break in the wake of the report , and president @entity53 has called on the @entity54 to investigate @entity16 's allegations and pleaded for witnesses to come forward with information			1
a few weeks before the november 19 article hit the newsstands , student - run @entity58 interviewed the associate dean of students , @entity60 , who guides women through their options when they report they 've been assaulted			1
in the interview , @entity60 admitted that no student had been expelled for committing sexual assault , even when there was an admission , and even though offenses such as academic cheating regularly lead to expulsion			2
opinion : stop shaming victims in college rapes " i feel if a person is willing to come forward in that setting and admit they violated the policy when there is absolutely no advantage to do so , then i feel that deserves some consideration , that they are willing to say , ' i have done something wrong and i am willing to take my licks and deal with it , ' " @entity60 told reporter @entity76 , explaining why no one had been expelled			2
@entity60 said there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year			0
" i do feel like that person admitting in that context it shows a recognition of what they have done is wrong , and a willingness to improve , " @entity60 said , when pressed on the subject			0
" i think we are trying to balance the rights of the individual who is being accused as well as the rights of the complainant and sometimes that is very difficult , " she said			0
" i think you would be surprised to see the number of survivors who i 've worked with who do n't even want to file a complaint , because they do n't want to get the accused person in trouble			2
" opinion : a student responds although @entity60 's interview struck many as tone deaf , particularly given the @entity7 story , @entity16 released an open letter in support of the associated dean to the student newspaper , the @entity124			1
@entity16 and other victims of assault at the school said @entity60 helped them tremendously as they dealt with what happened to them			0
" how can we not do the same for her in her darkest moment ? " asked the letter from her supporters			0
" @entity133 has truly saved my life			0
if it were not for her , i do not know if i could be alive today , " @entity16 wrote			0
opinion : punish rapists , not fraternities another victim who spoke to @entity141 , @entity140 , said that @entity60 has " the hardest job at @entity2 " and said the problems highlighted by @entity7 are more about the policy than about a person			1
those policies were at the heart of the discussion at the special board meeting , where officials pledged to change cultural conditions and to improve support for survivors			2
the university also announced that the state attorney general has asked the law firm @entity156 to do an investigation of how the school responds to reports of sexual violence , especially in cases where alleged victims choose not to make a formal complaint			0
" i want to make it perfectly clear to you , and to the watching world that nothing is more important to me than the safety of our students , " president @entity53 said at the meeting			0
" not our reputation , not our success , and not our history or tradition			0
" opinion : @entity2 's answer to rape allegations a farce			1
