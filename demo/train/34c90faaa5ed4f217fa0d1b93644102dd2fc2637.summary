the @entity9 romped to her second straight victory in the @entity11 , following her revenge win over @entity14 champion @entity13 on tuesday			1
the @entity14 runner - up 's kick serve was a potent weapon against @entity2 , with the triumph giving the 26 - year - old every chance of reaching the semifinals ahead of her final group match against @entity24 's @entity23 on thursday			1
it was her second victory over a top - ranked player this year , having beaten @entity27 on the way to reaching the final in @entity30			2

@entity2 , who thrashed seventh seed @entity23 on tuesday , will next take on @entity40 's @entity13 on thursday			1

the @entity52 , returning to action after having a mole cut off her foot , broke @entity46 to love in the first game of the match and then again in the seventh			2
the three - time @entity57 champion was less impressive in the second set but had enough to see off the @entity59 , who is struggling with illness in the oppressive heat in @entity63			0
" it was n't my best tennis , but it was good enough			0
i felt i did a lot of good things , and there are a few things i need to tweak			0
the more matches i get , the better it will go , " said @entity41 , who plays eighth seed @entity71 on thursday			1
@entity71 was disappointed after squandering a great chance to upset second - seeded @entity24 @entity76 , with the @entity77 losing 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 4 in the day 's first match despite leading by a break in both sets			1
" i had a lot of chances and was very unlucky in some moments			0
there were like one million nets from her side , " sunday 's @entity85 champion told the event 's official website			2
" it 's part of the game though			2
i think i played a good match and i 'm still in the group -- i still have chances to play further			2
i 'm going to keep fighting and trying to do my best			0
" it 's very humid here			0
sometimes your racquet just slips out of your hands			0
it 's the same conditions for everybody , but i had less time to prepare than anybody else			0
i 'm still happy to be here and i have to regroup from today			0
" it was @entity76 's second successive win , following her victory over @entity46 on tuesday , and she is the only player in the eight - woman field who can overtake the 20 - year - old @entity2 in the rankings			1
" it 's maybe one of the longest straight - set matches i 've ever played			0
we 've played so many times before , i 'm just happy to get through , " said @entity76 , who trailed 4 - 2 in the first set and 3 - 1 in the second before winning in one hour 45 minutes			1
meanwhile , the @entity119 has named former men 's no. 1 player @entity120 as the successor to @entity124 captain @entity123			1
