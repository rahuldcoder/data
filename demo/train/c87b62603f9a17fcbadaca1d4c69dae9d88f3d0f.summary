-- in these days of austerity , thin profit margins , low competitiveness and high unemployment , we often hear of companies braving the economic storm with innovation and ingenuity			0
for niche businesses , this can work			0
others , however , need to think carefully about a plan of attack			0
it 's not just a question of turning your attention to international markets in the hope of making up the bleak numbers at home			0
advice from chief executives suggests you need to know your markets , tweak your products and then push your brand			0
@entity28 have been doing just that			1
and it 's led to them exporting around 12 million pints of beer a year			1
founded in 1654 , the brewery has seen its fair share of economic difficulties			0
but this time the crisis is twofold : the economic crisis facing @entity38 and the impact of beer duty at home			0
despite the deepening crisis in @entity38 , @entity43 , chairman of @entity28 , told me the latter crisis was his bigger concern			1
the @entity48 government introduced a 2 % duty on beer and wine back in 2008 , but since then it has reportedly increased 42 %			2
that , @entity43 tells me , is crippling the industry and sapping demand for its product in the @entity48			2
according to @entity43 : " we pay , in this country , 40 % of all the beer duty for the whole of the @entity60 and we have something like twelve times the amount of tax that the @entity64 do			1
" that tax burden forced @entity28 to seek out new sources of income			1
and so the company turned its attention to exports			1
it now exports to 68 countries around the world , roughly the equivalent of twelve million pints per year			1
the company increased volumes by 200 % in the last five years			1
traditional beers such as @entity28 and @entity78 have also benefited from what 's been dubbed " the @entity80 - effect , " that came with hosting the @entity82 , celebrating the jubilee and the royal wedding			1
but @entity28 has also adjusted its product to suit each market			1
the @entity87 has become one of their biggest export markets			0
tax in the @entity87 is per bottle rather than then by alcohol level , and @entity28 has successfully tapped the market by selling a wide variety of drinks with different alcohol levels			1
it has adapted the aesthetic slightly by selling them in cardboard baskets rather than in plastic packs			2
@entity102 and @entity103 , meanwhile , prefer draft beer , even if that 's 8.5 % alcohol content			1
to keep up with such international demands , the company , which has always been based in @entity80 , has had to invest in its facility			2
@entity43 told me the company had spent $ 9 million extending the already crammed brewery			2
robots were brought in to maximize space and allow for the quick loading and unloading of kegs and beer pallets			0
a new production line that cleans , sterilizes and fills beer kegs has also been introduced , allowing for greater capacity			0
@entity120 , the company 's packaging operations manager , tells me this line alone has enabled them to produce 60 to 70 thousand kegs per week compared to 3,000 eight years ago			2
it 's an investment that has enabled them to keep up with international thirst for its beers and in turn beat the gloom in the @entity48			0
if that were n't enough , this @entity80 brewery is also overturning the common perception abroad that @entity48 beer is warm , weak and undrinkable .			0

@entity28 demand that has seen volumes increase by 200 % in the last five years
the company has had success in selling a wide variety of drinks with different alcohol levels .
@entity28 exports to 68 countries around the world , roughly the equivalent of twelve million pints per year
