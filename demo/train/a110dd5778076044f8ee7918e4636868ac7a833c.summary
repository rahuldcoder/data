@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 chancellor @entity3 expressed solidarity with @entity0 tuesday on a trip to @entity1 , even as tens of thousands of @entity0 rallied to show their anger toward her over the hardship their country is suffering			1
critics see @entity3 as the main enforcer of the @entity14 - imposed austerity measures that have left a large number of @entity0 unemployed and streaming to soup kitchens for a hot meal			1
police estimated that as many as 25,000 people turned out to demonstrate in central @entity1 , despite a ban on protests in certain areas amid beefed - up security for @entity3 's six - hour stay			1
@entity3 , who was making her first visit to @entity1 in several years , spoke of @entity0 as a partner and a friend to @entity4 as she addressed reporters with @entity0 prime minister @entity29			1
@entity3 noted that @entity0 was going through a " very difficult phase " in which many people were suffering , but she insisted the debt - stricken nation had made progress in reducing its deficit and passing reforms			1
" it 's for this reason that i would like to say that a huge part of the journey has already been accomplished , " she said			0
" @entity4 and @entity0 are going to work very closely together , " she added , as fellow members of @entity42 and the euro single currency			1
thousands protest austerity measures in @entity0 @entity29 , whose coalition government is seeking new ways to implement budget cuts of 11.5 billion euros ( $ 14.49 billion ) to ensure the country receives another international bailout installment this month , also stressed the strong ties between the two nations			1
" the @entity0 are proud and they know how to show support for their friends , and we welcome a friend here today , " @entity29 said of @entity3			1
@entity0 would show those speculators who had wagered on its collapse and exit from the eurozone that they were wrong , he said			2
@entity0 president @entity60 also welcomed @entity3 's visit at what he said was a very difficult time for his people			1
" they have nearly exhausted how much they can take			0
and of course we need to think of measures that will give hope to these people that are suffering , " he said			1
those measures must include steps to boost growth and create jobs for young people and women , he told the @entity4 chancellor			1
@entity3 and @entity29 met with @entity0 and @entity4 business leaders following their joint news conference			1
the crowds of protesters who gathered in @entity83 , by the @entity0 parliament building , had largely dispersed by tuesday evening			2
earlier , a number of people were arrested after objects were thrown at riot police			2
many protesters , some of whom belong to labor unions and @entity93 , the radical - left opposition party , carried @entity95 banners			0
" @entity3 we are a free nation and not your colony , " said one banner			2
another read , " @entity100 ( out , in @entity4 )			2
murderer of 3,500 @entity0 , " a reference to the number of @entity0 who have taken their own lives , according to some estimates , as a result of the current hardship			0
before her visit , @entity3 told @entity2 she knows the austerity measures have been hard on some			1
" it 's very bitter obviously , sacrifices need to be made , " she said			0
" but i think these are necessary measures that have to be taken , i think it was not easy for anyone to impose those measures on them , but these , i think , have been made on the background of great experience			0
" analysts say that for @entity3 , who faces a general election next year , the @entity1 trip also sends a message back home that she views @entity0 as an integral part of @entity42			1
while some within her own governing coalition have spoken of the need for contingency plans for a possible @entity0 exit from the euro , @entity3 has signaled that she would view that outcome as extremely risky			1
however , many @entity4 taxpayers are opposed to committing more @entity42 funds to @entity0			1
in return for international bailout funds , @entity0 has agreed to the austerity program and labor market reforms -- measures that have led to violent street demonstrations in the past			1
speaking in @entity83 , @entity93 leader @entity142 said @entity3 had come to @entity1 in support of @entity29 and his ministers " while the people are on their knees ahead of new , barbaric measures			1
" but , he said , her visit would allow the @entity0 people to send a message to the rest of @entity42 that they were stronger than those supporting the bankers and bailouts			1
" the democratic tradition of @entity42 will not allow a @entity42 people , the @entity0 people , to be transformed into a crisis ' guinea pig ' and for @entity0 to become a vast social cemetery			1
we will win in the end , because we are right and we are many , " he said			0
to comply with the belt - tightening measures , salaries have been cut for many workers in @entity0 , pensions and benefits have been slashed , and unemployment rates have soared			2
as of may , 53.8 % of @entity0 younger than 25 were unemployed , according to @entity169 , the statistics division of the @entity170			0
a number of those who demonstrated in @entity1 on tuesday said it was the first time they had taken to the streets to protest the economic crisis -- a reflection , perhaps , of how widely the anger over austerity is now felt			2
many of the protesters were retirees , a group that has lost , in many cases , more than 30 % of its income since the crisis hit			0
retirees are also among the groups that will be most affected by the new measures to which @entity0 must agree in order to receive the next tranche of its international bailout loan			2
@entity191 , a 53 - year - old civil servant , told @entity2 she was protesting for the first time since she was a university student			0
" @entity3 does not know what is going on in @entity0			2
she only hears the politicians ' voices			0
it would be better if she stayed longer to see the reality , " @entity191 said			0
@entity199 , a 56 - year - old schoolteacher who lived in @entity200 , @entity4 , for 18 years , said : " @entity3 will cause the eruption of @entity0 society , and then this will spread throughout southern @entity42			1
this may lead to a eurozone collapse			0
" but @entity206 , a university student , welcomed the @entity4 chancellor 's visit			1
" it is clearly positive , because as we know , @entity4 is the largest power in @entity42 at the moment and one of the largest powers in the world , " he said			0
" it is clear that the support of ms. @entity3 is good for our country and is needed			2
" @entity2 ireporter @entity219 , from @entity221 , saw the buildup to the protest			0
" it seemed like a fairly tense atmosphere , " she said			0
" the main road near our apartment was absolutely deserted , seems like everything shut down for the day			0
someone told us to use extreme caution and to leave as soon as possible , which we did			0
" @entity4 foreign minister @entity233 told @entity235 newspaper last week that @entity0 deserves " fairness and respect			2
" he suggested that @entity3 's visit represents a show of eurozone solidarity between nations that are fiscally healthy and those that are debt - ridden and battling savage cuts and social unrest			1
@entity246 , a senior economist at @entity247 , told @entity2 that @entity3 's visit to @entity1 comes as a " surprise " and that there was " a significant risk that @entity0 will exit the euro in the next two years			1
" however , @entity253 , director of @entity254 , says that the risk of a @entity0 exit from the eurozone remains " marginal " at the moment and that the so - called troika -- the @entity170 , @entity260 and @entity259 -- will provide @entity0 with the next tranche of bailout funds to meet its debt obligations			0
but @entity253 warns that the country will have to undergo stringent austerity measures before creditors will release any funds			2
" the vast majority will come from an additional round of cuts to wages and pensions			0
it 's going to be almost 8 billion euros of the 13.5 billion euros coming from that			0
the total cut is 11.5 billion euros and then 2 billion euros of additional taxes , " he told @entity2			0
on monday , the @entity278 -- a meeting of eurozone finance ministers -- convened in @entity281 to give the green light to the @entity283 , the 17 - nation currency bloc 's permanent bailout fund			0
@entity286 is expected to be the first country to make a request for financial aid from the @entity283			0
@entity2 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report .			0
