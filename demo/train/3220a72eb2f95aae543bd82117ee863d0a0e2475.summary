-- there are two groups of @entity3 : those who pander to nativists by encouraging @entity7 prejudice and exploiting the fear and anxiety that come from changing demographics , and those who tolerate the first group			1
both groups are spoiling the @entity3			1
and they 're making life too easy for @entity15 , who -- while never particularly good at addressing the needs and concerns of @entity19 voters -- have lately excelled in the neglect department			1
the more latinos are antagonized by @entity3 , the more they get ignored by @entity15			1
@entity25 n't that swell ? the result for @entity28 's largest minority is a political paradox , where the media insists this community has tremendous power while those of us within the community know the opposite is true			0
we 're not getting stronger			0
such is the misfortune of today 's @entity19 voter , and it 's the goal of @entity15 to bring it up			1
when you do n't have much to offer , you cling to what little you have -- even if it 's just a bumper sticker slogan : " vote @entity43			0
because we 're not as bad as @entity3			2
" look at what happened with @entity46 minority leader @entity45 of @entity47 and rep. @entity48 , @entity50 - @entity49 , when he made remarks about @entity3 and racism on @entity0 's " @entity53 " on sunday			1
and recently , @entity45 was asked by reporters if she thought race factors into how @entity3 deal with the @entity57 administration			1
pivoting to a hot topic , @entity45 responded : " i think race has something to do with the fact that they 're not bringing up an immigration bill			2
" first , that took chutzpah			0
this is the same @entity45 who , when she wielded the gavel from 2007 to 2009 , deliberately kept immigration off the congressional agenda			0
her top lieutenant at the time , rep. @entity72 , who talked openly about his reluctance to engage the issue , went so far as to label immigration the " third rail " of @entity28 politics			0
did the @entity15 ' failure to bring up immigration during the two years they controlled both houses of @entity82 also have something to do with race ? it seems only fair to ask , given what @entity45 said about the @entity3			1
the real reason @entity15 put immigration on the back burner was n't racial but political			1
@entity90 leaders give lip service to backing the idea of giving legal status to the undocumented , but the rank - and - file are n't sold			0
@entity15 are no more eager to divide their party than @entity3 are to divide theirs			1
@entity15 benefit from @entity3 missteps			1
if the @entity3 acts as an obstacle , it saves the @entity15 from having to play the villain			1
@entity45 is right about race -- or more precisely , ethnicity , since @entity103 are n't a race -- having a lot to do with why @entity106 wo n't bring up an immigration bill			1
since most immigrants to the @entity28 , both legal and illegal , are now @entity19 , @entity3 are afraid that -- whichever way the debate goes -- they 'll be painted as " anti-latino , " which will lead to another beating at the ballot box			2
besides , if they restart the immigration debate , @entity3 can count on someone in their party saying something idiotic or incendiary that will turn off @entity103			1
when asked by reporters to comment on what @entity45 had said ( notice how helpful the liberal media can be in advancing the narrative that @entity106 are hostile to minorities ) , @entity118 said , " to a significant extent , the @entity3 base does have elements that are animated by racism			1
" @entity118 has a point			0
many @entity28 approach the immigration debate by succumbing to racism			2
they have for 250 years , starting when @entity132 railed against the @entity133 in the mid- 1700s			0
that 's a ready made constituency			0
in the last 20 years , a faction of the @entity3 has stepped up to service it			2
and whereas , a hundred years ago , the political @entity137 would have been the @entity138 or the @entity139 , today it 's the @entity103			0
yet , that 's only half the story			0
here 's the rest : racism is n't limited to one party			1
today , you 'll find @entity7 elements of the @entity15			1
@entity15 politicians are careful not to say anything ugly			2
but rank - and - file @entity15 voters are more uninhibited with their comments			2
travel the country , as i have , and you 'll hear the same remarks from @entity15 that you hear from @entity3 -- about how @entity19 immigrants are defiant , dangerous or deficient			1
this is why you see resistance to legalizing the undocumented from normally liberal voters in the @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164			0
we do n't have political power , and we 're suffering through a litany of bad choices			0
but there 's a way to improve our lot , and it has nothing to do with demographics			0
we have to avoid oversimplifying our predicament by blaming only republicans for the poisonous mood of the immigration debate			2
over the years , leading up to the @entity57 administration 's dubious record of deporting 2 million people in five years , @entity15 have done their share of damage			2
are racism and nativism part of the immigration debate ? of course they are			0
but the antidote to such bigotry is n't tolerance or open - mindedness			0
and there is only one way for @entity103 to get it , and that 's by staying in play and making both parties compete for our votes			0
and oftentimes , one does n't have anything to do with the other .			0

@entity207 : *anti-immigration* republicans are spoiling the @entity3
@entity207 : some *democrats* say race is a reason for failure of immigration reform
he says racism is n't limited to one party ; it never has been in history
@entity207 : there are @entity7 elements in @entity15 and @entity3 parties
