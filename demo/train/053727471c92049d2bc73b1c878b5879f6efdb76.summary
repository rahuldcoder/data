@entity0 -- on tuesday , for the second time this month , the @entity3 field will debate foreign policy , a topic that has n't seen much attention in the race until now			1
the candidates will be fighting an uphill battle against the president 's strong record on national security			1
president @entity14 has racked up an impressive series of foreign policy victories and promises kept : he ordered a daring raid that resulted in the death of @entity20 and has taken out scores of top @entity23 leaders , including lead recruiter @entity24			2
he brought the @entity26 war to a close , as promised , and has started a responsible withdrawal from @entity29			2
without putting a single @entity32 soldier on the ground and for only about a thousandth of the cost of the @entity26 war , the president helped the @entity37 people oust @entity38 , a ruthless dictator who supported terrorists			1
@entity14 has also led the international community in putting the squeeze on @entity43 's leaders through tough sanctions and ratified the new start treaty negotiated with @entity46			2
voters have recognized these successes			0
polls show the public backs @entity14 's pragmatic , results - based approach to foreign policy			1
fulfilling his promise to end the @entity26 war is the president 's most popular move : more than three in four @entity32 -- 77 % -- approve of @entity14 's decision to withdraw @entity32 troops from @entity26 by the end of the year , according to @entity62 polling			1
in addition , 63 % approve of the president 's terrorism policies , turning what was expected to be a weakness into a strength			0
the @entity3 field has responded to the president 's successful efforts abroad with what the @entity73 editorial board called " bad analysis and worse solutions , nothing that suggests real understanding or new ideas			2
" instead of taking seriously the need for the commander in chief to have at least a basic knowledge of the world , @entity3 have embraced their lack of experience on the issue			0
@entity87 made a telling gaffe last week when he insisted that he is " not supposed to know anything about foreign policy			0
" the @entity3 running to lead the country do n't seem to understand that the president ca n't plead ignorance			1
international crises especially require quick , effective decision - making -- presidents do n't have time to study up on @entity98 101			1
the lack of knowledge or experience has n't stopped republicans from falling into a familiar habit : opposition for the sake of opposition			0
if @entity14 favors something , @entity3 almost certainly oppose it			1
@entity108 originally built his argument against @entity14 's foreign policy by attacking the new @entity112 treaty -- an agreement supported by every living @entity3 secretary of state and our entire current military leadership			1
now @entity108 , along with others , is calling for bombing @entity43 , an action that former @entity120 commander four - star gen. @entity119 has said would " drag us into a conflict			0
" @entity14 has effectively rallied other nations for the strongest sanctions ever against @entity43 's nuclear program			2
@entity3 have lots of ideas about starting new wars , but few about how to keep meaningful pressure on @entity130			0
regarding @entity132 , the @entity3 field has routinely condemned @entity14 's leadership in trying to avert a crisis over the @entity136 request for statehood at the @entity139 @entity14 's policies have made @entity132 safer			1
@entity132 prime minister @entity140 praised @entity14 for his handling of the rescue of the @entity132 diplomats in @entity144 in september			0
the candidates continue to take any position that will distance them from the president and allow them to sound tough -- but it 's putting them out of step with military leaders and nonpartisan national security experts			1
much of the field has endorsed waterboarding -- widely considered torture -- and many have argued for cutting off all foreign aid			0
both of those positions are opposed by generals such as @entity160 and @entity161 as well as fellow republicans , including former defense secretary @entity163 and sen. @entity164			0
abandoning our values and " soft power " means abandoning leadership in the world			0
in addition , the field has tried to turn the phrase " leading from behind " into an overarching criticism of @entity14 's foreign policy			1
that rather inaccurate term was coined to explain @entity14 's response to the situation in @entity37			1
it 's funny that @entity3 would latch onto the phrase , because they 've shown a distinct lack of judgment and resolve on the issue			2
@entity184 of @entity185 documented that @entity108 has held five different positions on the @entity37 operation			0
it is probably @entity190 's most blatant flip - flop ; the former @entity192 speaker first endorsed intervention , then said he would n't have acted			2
the @entity3 field just ca n't admit that @entity14 got this right			1
even more telling than the issues candidates have talked about are the issues that have been downplayed			0
the last debate included little or no mention of post-war @entity26 , ignored the security implications of @entity204 's rise , and only at the last minute began to explore candidates ' thinking on the @entity208 financial crisis			1
twenty - first - century problems require 21st - century thinking			0
the @entity3 have displayed stunningly little of such thinking so far			0
expect lots of bluster and loose talk at tuesday 's debate , the sort that brought us the @entity26 war earlier this century while the search for @entity20 was essentially called off			1
then compare it to the pragmatic , effective approach of @entity14 and his list of accomplishments			2
it 's clear who should be on the receiving end of the 3 a.m. phone call			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			0

@entity229 : @entity3 presidential candidates ca n't beat @entity14 's record on national security
three - quarters of @entity32 approve of his decision to pull troops from @entity26 , @entity229 says
yet if @entity14 favors something , @entity3 candidates almost certainly oppose it , she says
@entity229 : expect bluster at tuesday 's @entity3 debate -- then compare it to @entity14 's approach
