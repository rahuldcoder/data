@entity1 justice @entity0 says torture -- depending on the circumstances , like if a nuclear bomb was planted in @entity3 -- is n't necessarily off limits			1
the justice who 's been a mainstay of the high court 's conservative wing for 28 years condemned the " self - righteousness of @entity14 liberals " who oppose torture " so easily " friday in an interview with @entity17			1
" i do n't think it 's so clear at all , " @entity0 said			1
" i think it is very facile for people to say ' oh , torture is terrible , ' " he said			2
" you posit the situation where a person that you know for sure knows the location of a nuclear bomb that has been planted in @entity3 and will kill millions of people			0
" you think it 's an easy question ? you think it 's clear that you can not use extreme measures to get that information out of that person ? " @entity0 also discussed the death penalty , saying he thinks it 's " too bad " that a campaign in @entity36 to re-institute capital punishment has been thwarted by the the country 's membership in the @entity40 , which has made the issue a requirement for all participating countries			1
" what are human rights is not written up in the sky , and if it were written up in the sky , it would not be up to judges , lawyers , just because they 've gone to law school , to know what human rights ought to be and therefore are , " @entity0 said			1
" and therefore each society 's perception of what it believes human rights should be ought to be up to that society , and i think it 's very foolish to yield that determinations not only to a foreign body but to a foreign body of judges , " he said			0
" i do n't know why anyone would want to do that			2
" and he brushed off questions about whether @entity1 decisions opening the door for outside groups to spend unlimited sums of money on elections have hurt the country , saying that " the amount of money that is spent on all elections -- state , local and federal -- in the @entity78 , is less than what women spend on cosmetics for a year , ok ? " he said the alternative is having @entity83 impose limits on " who can speak and how much who can speak			2
" " if you think that a fair system of election speech is going to be devised by the incumbent senators and congressmen , you are naive , " he said			0
" they will for sure , as they have in the past , devise a system that favors the incumbent			0
if that 's the choice of evils -- have a system that always favors the incumbent or , you know , let people speak as much as they want with as much money as they want -- i choose the latter			0
i do n't even regard the latter as an evil			2
" @entity0 said he does n't agree with the notion that outspending the other side is the key to winning elections			1
he said if people really believe " the masses are so ignorant that they are swayed by television ads , " then " let 's have a king			0
right ? let 's have a king			0
