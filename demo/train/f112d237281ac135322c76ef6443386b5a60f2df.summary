@entity0 , @entity1 -- a black @entity3 who has rankled liberals and suddenly risen in prominence is torpedoed with old allegations of sexual harassment as he challenges the conventional wisdom about how @entity10 - @entity9 think and pursues an important position atop the federal government			1
have n't we seen this movie ? get ready for the sequel			0
@entity16 reported recently that two women -- whose names are being withheld by the website -- accused @entity20 of sexual harassment in the 1990s while the businessman led the @entity23 , and that a financial settlement " in the five - figure range " was reached to keep the story quiet			1
when confronted with the allegation , the @entity3 front - runner showed that he is new to politics by mangling his responses in one media interview after another			2
at first , @entity20 went with the tried and tested approach : " no comment			1
" then he claimed to know nothing about the case			0
then he claimed that he did know a little about the case , but that he did n't know there had been a settlement			0
then he tried to tell us that there was a difference between a " settlement " and an " agreement			0
" and , by the end of the day , he was admitting that there had been a settlement and that , in the case of one woman , it had amounted to about three months salary			0
it was both amusing and painful to watch			0
i 'm not sure whether to applaud @entity20 for not knowing how to lie with the panache of other @entity3 presidential hopefuls , or tell him to run for the exit			1
i hope he does n't quit the race , as some @entity58 commentators are suggesting he should do -- not because this scandal is so bad that he ca n't recover , but because the elite media ca n't wait to clear the field and get to what they think will be the main event : @entity64 versus @entity65			1
there is no question that @entity20 's handling of this story was atrocious			1
but what is also troubling is that this scandal has a familiar ring -- one that goes back 20 years to the confirmation hearings for then - @entity76 nominee @entity75			1
i do n't know about you , but i 'm getting awfully tired of sexual harassment being the preferred line of attack against black conservatives			1
this is n't to say that sexual harassment is acceptable -- whether it 's a proposition or the creation of a hostile work environment			2
but the whole thing makes me queasy in light of the ugly history in this country of black men being described in sexually charged terms			2
i do n't care who the attack is leveled against ; anyone who plays with the idea of a black man acting inappropriately toward women is playing with dynamite			1
liberals who rejoice in the @entity20 story should remember that			1
@entity20 and the decline of black conservatism and why are black conservatives singled out for these kinds of attacks ? consider how many of them hold high office in this country			1
if you counted up all those who serve in the @entity115 , the @entity112 , and the 50 governorships , you 'd still have less than a handful			0
since the 1960 presidential election , @entity10 - @entity9 have shunned the @entity3 and tended to vote @entity118			0
politicians who break from that tradition automatically become a target , and their critics will pummel them with anything they 've got			2
after all , it 's not like @entity126 men are the only ones ever accused of sexual harassment			2
the alleged perpetrators come in all colors			0
during the 1990s , even before the @entity132 , president @entity131 could have easily become the poster boy for sexual harassment because of allegations by a former hotel worker named @entity136			2
while @entity131 was impeached by the @entity115 , he long ago closed that chapter in his life , and now he 's considered one of the @entity118 's elder statesman			0
there was also the notorious @entity143 scandal , where more than 100 aviation officers from the @entity145 and @entity146 -- most of them white -- were alleged to have sexually assaulted and / or sexually harassed more than 80 women at a gathering in @entity149			0
all this happened just one month before the @entity75 hearings , and yet we 're likely to remember one of these events much longer than we do the other			1
somehow , it was @entity75 whose name became synonymous with allegations of sexual harassment , after @entity160 came forward in october 1991 and claimed that while he was her boss at the @entity161 , he made sexual advances and created a hostile work environment			1
many @entity9 look back at @entity75 ' confirmation hearings and think they were mainly about accusations that @entity75 directed sexually blunt language at @entity160			1
but for me , what they were really about was n't dirty talk as much as dirty politics			0
black conservatives ask us to think outside the box , and so -- as some people see it -- they 're asking for trouble			2
the hearings were also about freedom -- the freedom to indulge in independent thought , even if it means biting the hands of liberal benefactors			0
you heard that criticism leveled at @entity75 , who opposes affirmative action even though -- according to his critics -- he benefited from it			1
and the public humiliation that @entity75 suffered remains a prime example of the liberal establishment trying to put someone in his place			1
now , in an outrageous example of patronizing language that borders on hate speech , @entity194 analyst @entity193 declared that the only reason that @entity20 is popular with white @entity3 is because " he 's a black man that knows his place			1
" we could have guessed this was coming , sooner or later			0
in the latest installment of " @entity203 , " the black @entity3 presidential candidate who knows his place is put in his place by a liberal commentator			2
@entity20 should be glad about one thing			1
as the attacks on him intensify , it proves definitively that he 's moving up in the world			0
as voters continue to respond favorably to the fact that he 's not a professional politician , he 's gone from novelty act to legitimate presidential contender			0
when that happens , there are those in both parties who will try to destroy you			0
even if it means -- just as it did 20 years ago -- hurting the country in the process			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224			2

@entity224 : @entity20 sex harassment charges a political attack as with @entity75
he says @entity20 *fumbled* situation , but story is really about media , others pushing him from the race
he says conservative black politicians are subject to *stereotypes*
