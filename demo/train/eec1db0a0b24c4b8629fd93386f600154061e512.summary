the man 's anger at authorities giving a briefing on @entity4 could not be contained			1
he screamed at the screen as a promised video conference with @entity8 authorities became the latest part of the aftermath of the plane 's disappearance to encounter technical difficulties			0
" you 're all bloody liars , and you 're lying to us again , " the @entity15 man said , according to a translation			1
families of the passengers on the missing plane in attendance at the @entity24 briefing wednesday exploded in anger and stormed out			1
" we will request their team of experts to come to @entity24 to conduct face - to - face communications and fulfill their commitment , " said @entity26 , a spokesman for some of the families			1
" what is the truth ? what problem do they want to cover up ? " the families have 26 questions they want answered now			1
the queries were posted on the social media site @entity41 by a committee representing some of the passengers ' relatives			0
some of the " questions " are requests that evidence be shared with them , including the flight 's logbook and recording of air traffic control on march 8 , the night the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard			0
most of the people on the plane were @entity15 , and their families have become very distrustful of @entity8 government authorities and officials with the airline			1
that was apparent in the request for @entity4 's log book			1
@entity64 , a former member of the @entity65 , told @entity66 the log is usually on the plane and even if it was n't , investigators would n't reveal specific information from it			1
he also said a request for phone numbers of investigators would be denied			1
but the other 24 questions and requests ? " these are not state secrets so the families should have access to all of that kind of information , " he said			2
many of the 26 questions focus on technical issues involving emergency locator transmitters , or @entity87 , and " black boxes			0
" with an apparent in - depth understanding of how these work , the families ask about the specific technology on the missing plane			1
elts are designed to activate after a crash and send a signal to a frequency monitored by air traffic controllers			0
" black boxes , " or voice and data recorders , could shed light on what went on in the plane 's cockpit and other crucial flight information			2
the families ' final seven questions involve " protocol , " including this : what did @entity111 do when the flight went missing ? the families also ask whether search and rescue teams have final results from searched areas , and whether the @entity8 government could specify the rights of family members " to know the facts of cases or the details of an incident			2
" @entity111 has said it shares all the information it has with appropriate authorities			0
in a video message this month , @entity128 , the airline 's commercial director , said the company shares the same " fundamental requirement " as the families : to find out what happened			2
@entity8 authorities have come under criticism repeatedly for their handling of the investigation			0
but the government has insisted it 's doing what it can to get to the bottom of what happened and support the families			2
" we understand that it has been a difficult time for all the families			2
and we appreciate that many families want to see physical evidence before they will accept that @entity4 ended in the southern @entity149 , " acting transport minister @entity150 said at the end of march			1
" ... the question that the families principally want answered , is the question we simply do not have the answer to -- namely , where their loved ones are , and where is @entity4			2
" a week earlier , @entity150 made a pledge to the families : " we will do everything in our power to keep you informed			2
" @entity163 completes ' full search ' after two previous setbacks that officials called minor , an underwater vessel searching for traces of @entity4 resurfaced thursday morning after completing what search officials called a " full mission			1
" the @entity163 has now searched a total of 90 square kilometers ( 34.7 square miles ) in its first three trips to the ocean floor			1
on its second trip the @entity163 was forced to resurface after 11 hours because it needed to have a technical issue addressed			1
part of the equipment designed to help the @entity163 - 21 move deeper and avoid seepage was low on oil			1
officials replenished the supply and redeployed the vessel			2
the @entity163 has its electronics sealed in bottles so they are protected from saltwater			1
as the probe moves deeper and the pressure increases , the operating system pushes oil into these bottles			2
the oil counters the pressure and prevents saltwater from seeping in			0
if oil fills the container , there 's no space for saltwater			0
" in no way should this suggest that ( the @entity203 ) is not ' hardy ' enough to be working at this depth			2
on the contrary , it is absolutely the best piece of equipment for the job we are doing , " a source close to the operation said , adding that technical issues are common at great depths			0
data from its second and third mission have been downloaded , the @entity216 @entity215 said			1
there were no " significant detections " during the second search			0
24 - hour mission @entity163 takes two hours to get near the ocean floor and another two hours to return to the surface			1
it aims to map the ocean floor for 16 hours to retrieve data , which then take four hours to analyze			0
the vessel searches maximum depths of 4,500 meters ( 14,764 feet ) , and before the technical interruption , it was scheduled to complete its second dive about 10 a.m. et , a source said			0
the @entity232 has determined the seafloor in the search area reaches a maximum depth of 4,600 meters ( 15,092 feet )			1
the @entity163 operators said they can reprogram it to operate at 5,000 meters ( 16,404 feet ) , meaning it can search the originally designated area , which is thought to have yielded the most promising clues			1
it is where a second audio signal that searchers thought was manmade and the right frequency to belong to the flight data recorder 's emergency beacon			0
the quality of the " ping " led authorities to focus the underwater search in the area			0
an oil sample taken from a slick on the surface in that section of the ocean is at a lab being analyzed to see if it is an aviation or maritime fluid			0
' garbage patch ' " we have known a long time that especially the recent search area , the new search area they are looking at now , there 's a lot of debris there because it is close to what we call the garbage patch , and that 's where all of the garbage accumulates , " said @entity260 , a physical oceanographer at @entity261			0
" there are five in each basin and one in the @entity149			1
everything that has been thrown in the ocean in the last 50 years and still floating is somewhere in this garbage patch			0
" @entity4 vanished on march 8 with 239 people aboard after taking off from @entity284 , @entity8 , bound for @entity24			0
with no debris found after weeks of searches and no possible pings from the plane 's " black boxes " detected in a week , officials said it 's time to focus the search underwater			0
while air and sea surface searches continued thursday in a zone centered about 2,170 kilometers ( 1,348 miles ) northwest of @entity297 , those searches are probably nearing an end			0
still , thursday 's surface search area grew significantly to 40,349 square kilometres ( 15,578.8 square miles ) .			0

@entity149 is a depth the @entity163 probe should be able to handle , @entity232 indicates
" you 're all bloody liars , and you 're lying to us again , " says angry man at families ' briefing
families want log , official phone numbers , other data
officials say @entity163 completed its third mission with no *hiccups*
