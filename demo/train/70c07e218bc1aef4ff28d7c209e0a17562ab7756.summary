-- one man 's fund - raising efforts to publish a book on " getting awesome with women " raked in thousands of dollars , but also allegations that it is a guide to sexual assault			1
@entity8 describes his book as a self - help book for men seeking advice on interacting with the opposite sex			1
" it is a guide for men to get better with women , " he explains in a video on the crowd - funding website @entity15 , which he used to raise funds			1
@entity8 , who lives in @entity22 , according to his online profile , raised more than $ 16,000 to publish his book , but the contents have also provoked ire from those who call it a how - to guide for would - be rapists			1
he writes in the book : " the concept of ' waiting for signs ' or ' indicators of interest ' was commonplace in older pickup theory			2
it is 100 % garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet			0
" " from now on you must assume that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished , " the book continues			2
" physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. do n't ask for permission			0
force her to rebuff your advances			0
" people turned to @entity46 and other social media to criticize not just @entity8 's project , but also @entity15 for having hosted it			1
an online petition demanding that @entity15 remove the project garnered nearly 30,000 signatures by wednesday evening			1
" ' @entity53 ' does n't even begin to describe it : basically , it 's a how - to guide on sexually assaulting women , " the petition states			1
but @entity15 says it will not delete @entity8 's crowd - funding project			1
" some of this material is abhorrent and inconsistent with our values as people and as an organization , " @entity15 said in a statement			0
" based on our current guidelines , however , the material on @entity67 did not warrant the irreversible action of canceling the project			0
" the website said the controversy will lead to reviews of their policies , but did n't elaborate			0
@entity8 denies that his book is a tool for would - be attackers			1
he is " devastated and troubled " by the allegations , @entity8 said in a statement			2
the book excerpts that critics are sharing are taken out of context , he said			2
they come from a later chapter on physical escalation that follows clear advice that " no means no , " he said			0
" the gist of the controversial advice is , ' do n't wait for signs before you make your move			0
let her be the one who rejects your advances			0
if she says no , stop immediately and tell her you do n't want to do anything that would make her uncomfortable , ' " @entity8 said			2
according to his @entity15 page , because he raised much more than his stated fund - raising goal , @entity8 is going to take his theories on the road			1
he plans to host free seminars in @entity102 and @entity103 .			0
