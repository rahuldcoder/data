-- @entity1 once again is diving into @entity3 politics			1
the free encyclopedia on tuesday temporarily shut down access to most of its russian - language site in protest of proposed legal action in @entity10 that it says would result in internet censorship			1
visitors to ru.wikipedia.org on tuesday saw a black censorship bar over the @entity1 logo and a message asking them to imagine a world without free access to knowledge			1
in january , @entity1 shuttered its @entity21 sites for 24 hours in protest of anti-piracy laws that were being discussed in the @entity24			1
that action was cited as evidence of a new wave of political power for the technology and @entity3 industries			0
@entity31 and others joined in that protest , which essentially derailed two anti-piracy bills in the @entity35			1
the @entity10 @entity1 site compares proposed amendments to an " on information " law to @entity40 's hyper - restrictive firewall			1
if implemented , the changes to the law could result in access to @entity1 being cut off permanently , the group says			2
" lobbyists and activists who support the given amendments are claiming that they are directed exclusively against content like child pornography ' and the like , ' but according to presented reports and statements , a prototype of ' the @entity53 ' will be created in @entity10 , " @entity1 says in a statement on its site , which was translated from @entity10			1
" the practice of implementing existing @entity10 laws suggests a high chance of a worse scenario , in which access to @entity1 will be denied across the country			1
" given the precedent , there 's a good chance access to @entity1 will be denied across the country			1
" the bills , according to news reports , would allow the government to blacklist certain websites			0
the aim , the government says , is to protect internet users from harmful content like child pornography and websites that promote substance abuse			0
" the @entity10 bill currently under discussion in parliament seeks to introduce a non-governmental internet watchdog , which would monitor the web for potentially harmful content and request hosting companies to restrict access to the marked pages , " reports @entity76 , a @entity10 news site that receives government funding			2
" if this is not done , the page would be blacklisted			0
the bill also has stricter provisions for parental guidance ratings for content			0
" the updates do not have universal support in the @entity10 government , the news site says			2
the country 's information minister , for example , has " voiced doubt " about the changes , saying they would be difficult to enforce			2
another @entity10 site , however , reports that the bill has broad support in the @entity107 , @entity10 's parliament			1
the state - owned news agency @entity108 elaborates on the bill 's provisions : " according to the draft document , submitted to the @entity107 on june 7 , the unified roster of banned websites will be run by a federal agency to be appointed by the government , " that news site says			2
" the agency will have the right to add items to the blacklist , as will the courts , which already have the authority to ban extremist and other types of content that violates @entity10 legislation			0
" on @entity128 , @entity10 's communications minister appeared to say the criticism from @entity1 was healthy			1
" i do n't support @entity133 's intentions to close , " @entity130 wrote in a message translated from @entity10			2
" but this step is an important reaction of our society and a sign that we need to improve			0
" @entity1 's political stance and temporary shutdown could be viewed by some as hypocritical			1
the digital encyclopedia , run by a nonprofit , is dedicated to the spread of free information			0
in january , however , @entity1 founder @entity146 told @entity0 that it is the encyclopedia 's role to stand up when free speech and @entity3 freedoms are threatened			1
" free speech includes the right to not speak , " he said			0
" we are a community of volunteers			0
we have written this thing that we believe to be a gift to the world			0
we do n't charge people for it			0
it 's freely available to anybody who wants to ( use it )			0
and i think it 's important for people to realize that the ability of our community to come together and give this kind of gift to the world depends on a certain legal infrastructure that makes it possible for people to share knowledge freely			0
