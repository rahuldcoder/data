-- chances are , there are some people in your life who spend a whole lot of their free time fiddling on the computer , tinkering with their phones in public settings , and yelling at the television when players perform poorly for professional sports teams that they supposedly hate			2
yes , fantasy sports has become as much of a pastime as the actual playing of real sports in real life , and a testament to its power is @entity21 's " @entity20 , " a half - hour sitcom that follows a group of 30 - something males ( and one female ) as they negotiate their own careers and adulthood by going to any length to sabotage their opponents en route to victory			1
" @entity20 " was created by " @entity33 " / " @entity36 " vet @entity34 and his wife , @entity35			1
both serve as writers , directors and producers for the show			2
" it 's not just a sports comedy			2
if you know nothing about fantasy football , you 're still going to laugh your ass off , " @entity35 says			1
" @entity20 " concluded its third season late last month and enjoyed its best numbers to date			1
comedy heavyweights such as @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 all made guest appearances alongside @entity59 players @entity57 , @entity60 © and @entity61			0
with the actual playoffs now in full swing , as well as a fourth season for the show slated for next fall , @entity0 spoke with the @entity67 about the show 's success and the subtle differences between a fantasy football joke and a fantasy league joke			1
@entity0 : how did the initial pitch for a show about fantasy football go ? @entity35 : in television , they wo n't really let you through the door unless you have something of an organizing principle			1
for us , a fantasy football league is an adult male or co-ed book club			0
thirty to forty million people play , and they just do n't play -- they 're obsessed with it			0
we like to say the show is a comedy about people who play fantasy football , not a comedy about fantasy football			2
we were lucky that @entity21 saw that			0
the fantasy football concept is just an excuse for the characters to behave like villains and babies every week			0
@entity34 : for us , people go " oh , my @entity102 , how can you do a show about fantasy football ? " but 35 million people playing something is not a niche			1
@entity0 : @entity34 , you 've worked on " @entity33 " and " @entity36			1
" now that there 's three season of " @entity20 , " what 's different about the comedic styles ? @entity34 : " @entity20 " is written and produced the same way that " @entity36 " is written and produced			1
and " @entity36 " was basically written the same way " @entity33 " was			1
all of it is based on stories and interweaving those in a satisfying half - hour			0
it may seem a little different , because the problems of @entity119 are not necessarily the problems of every man			0
but @entity119 , who watches the show and enjoys it , he 'd say , " we should do this " and i 'd say , " no , we did that on ' @entity20			1
' " @entity35 : the dirty little secret is that " @entity36 " and " @entity33 " are much cleaner shows			1
i 'm the one with the dirty sense of humor			0
@entity0 : " @entity20 " has slowly gained a fanbase of these last years			1
what 's been critical to its success ? @entity35 : we make our show for about $ 750,000 per episode , in about three days			1
all on location , no set			0
and we have six leads			0
it 's a mad dash to make the show , but @entity21 does not have big marketing budgets for their comedies			1
we are completely relying on word of mouth			0
@entity34 : what ( fx president ) @entity146 said to us : " we need shows that can make their own noise			1
" which is fine , and they leave it up to us to make our own noise			0
our fans are very loyal and passionate and funny , and they 've seemed to embrace the show like it 's their secret			1
people feel very possessive of it and they want to show you this thing that they love			2
@entity0 : you also have this perfect storm , where the season airs during @entity59 season and fantasy football leagues are in full swing			0
@entity35 : it 's a funny show about a shared passion			1
@entity34 : the audience is growing , and we 're super-excited for season four			2
and we 're tebowing that there will be a season five			0
@entity0 : the third season seemed to rely less on fantasy football jokes and went into the guys ' lives in a broader sense			0
@entity35 : i think what happens when you get to the third season of a show , their lives begin to get fleshed out			1
for example , since the first season , we 've talked about the lure of @entity190 's sister being this sexual mentor to the guys			2
as we continue to make those jokes , we decided to make room to meet her			0
you have the stories that you want to tell , but you also have the deep history and the lure that you want to start parceling out			0
the hardest thing about making the show is the time			2
we have 20 minutes and 45 seconds			0
with @entity34 and " @entity36 , " they have the luxury of making it however long they feel like making it			1
we try to do a lot of fantasy lines and jokes , and some are more heavy than others			0
@entity34 : there may have been less stories about fantasy football - specific stuff , but i thought there were just as many fantasy league stuff			2
the whole arc of the season is that they 've cheated in the draft order			0
that 's not a specific story like the one where @entity225 's girlfriend wo n't let him play @entity227			2
we try to make the whole season about the league dynamic .			0
