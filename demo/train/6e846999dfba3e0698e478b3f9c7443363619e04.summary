@entity0 , @entity1 -- after a second day of jury selection in the @entity10 murder trial , more prospective jurors facing weeks and possibly months away from home , family , work and school have been excused			1
while a few were dismissed for expressing opinions about the defendant , most were let go after revealing compelling hardship issues during questioning by the judge and lawyers from both sides			1
one woman in her 50s , who works at a hospice , said she can not go weeks without an income			1
her employer would not compensate her during the trial and she said she would not be able to pay her mortgage			1
another woman said she is in school and would have no one to care for her 4 - year - old daughter			1
the obstacles to serving represent a vivid cross-section of everyday struggles for @entity32 , especially in a fragile economic recovery			2
financial difficulties , chronic illness , single parents trying to care for children while earning a living were among the excuses offered in court			1
the judge in the case , @entity41 , previously ruled that the jury would be sequestered throughout the trial			1
@entity41 wants to shield the panel of 12 and eight alternates from media coverage of the trial and other factors that could sway the outcome			2
" @entity58 " defines jury sequestration as '' the custodial isolation of a trial jury to prevent tampering and exposure to publicity			2
'' other major cases that have been sequestered in recent years include the @entity61 double murder trial in @entity62 and the trial of @entity64 , found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of her husband , a minister in @entity69 , @entity70			2
@entity10 's 2 - year - old daughter , @entity10 , disappeared in the @entity72 area in 2008			1
after a protracted search amid national news coverage , a repairman found the toddler 's remains in woods near her parents ' home			2
that the case is so high - profile makes it difficult to find a jury without prejudices			1
legitimate personal hardships -- universally considered grounds for dismissal in @entity32 courts -- present an extra challenge			2
a male juror said tuesday he is one of four nurses on a 24 - hour rotation for treating heart attack patients			2
his co-workers would have to " scramble " without him on the job , he said			2
others included a middle - aged woman who may need surgery ; a man who runs group homes for delinquent youths and is getting married this summer ; a man who wants to see his dying uncle in @entity105 , and a woman who is the sole caregiver for her disabled husband			0
she brings him to doctors and reminds him '' to take his pills			0
'' a woman in her 40s pays her children 's college tuition and works two jobs to supplement her income			0
she said she would have to borrow money or '' pull funds from other places '' to avoid falling behind on her mortgage			0
but not every juror claiming hardship was released			0
a man in his 30s said he runs a family - owned ace hardware store			0
his father has had heart attacks and strokes over the past several years , leaving his son to manage the business on his own			0
the man , who has two dogs , no children and no wife because he has n't '' found the right woman yet , '' said leaving the store for eight weeks would be a big problem , even though he has 34 employees			0
none of them are trained as managers , he said			0
however , when asked what else is on his calendar in the next several months , he said he has a business and pleasure trip to @entity144			0
that 's when he lost his argument			0
@entity147 , @entity148 's lead defense attorney , said if the man can go to @entity144 , he has someone to take care of the store			1
according to authorities , @entity10 took about a month to report her daughter 's disappearance to police			1
widely known as " @entity10 " from media coverage , @entity148 was arrested and charged with first - degree murder			1
she could face the death penalty if convicted			0
@entity148 was transported to @entity0 , @entity1 , and booked into the @entity162 for jury selection			0
@entity41 is holding jury selection in this @entity166 city of more than 100,000 to avoid assembling a panel that is likely to be more familiar with the case			1
@entity148 will return to @entity72 , about 100 miles to the east , for the trial , which could kick off next week			0
lawyers have also dismissed several potential jurors who expressed opinions about the case during voir dire , questioning to ensure jurors are not biased			1
the old @entity179 phrase means to speak the truth			0
jury selection is scheduled to resume wednesday morning			0
@entity41 dismissed a panel of candidates on tuesday , saying they were contaminated by a prospective juror overheard discussing the case			1
by sheer coincidence , the juror is a witness in the @entity148 case and was serving in @entity189			1
after screening for hardship , the court will ask remaining prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case , whether they could set that aside and if they were to find her guilty could they impose the death penalty			1
in a moment of limited levity on tuesday , @entity41 asked one potential juror who planned to visit @entity201 , @entity202 , with his wife in june for their wedding anniversary whether he would '' be in the dog house '' if the trip were put on hold			0
'' i think she 'd be a bit more upset than i would at this point , '' he said .			0

@entity10 case indicates how many need every *paycheck*
others have no one else to care for child or spouse
several dismissed for expressing opinions
