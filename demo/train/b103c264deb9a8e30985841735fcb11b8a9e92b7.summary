-- the old met the new			0
at one end of the court , the young man nicknamed " @entity3 " -- at the other was one of the all - time tennis greats , albeit one who is battling to show that he 's not a spent force			1
one of them has 77 career titles , but only one this year , while the other -- a former top - ranked junior -- won his first on the @entity14 last weekend			0
and after losing the first two games , despite a vociferous home backing , it certainly looked like @entity18 might be headed for another disappointing defeat			2
but the @entity21 legend battled back to show why he is the holder of a record 17 grand slam titles as he denied @entity24 -- 10 years younger at 22 -- a famous victory in @entity26			1
@entity3 , now ranked a comparatively lowly sixth by his high standards , eventually triumphed 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) against the @entity29 as he also came from behind in the second set to force the tie - break			2
" it was very important to win in two sets , " said @entity3 , who notched his 50th win in his home city event -- a feat he had previously managed only in the four majors			2
" there were a lot of free gifts out there in some games			0
when i saved three set points i just told myself to play one point at a time and hope to get there			0
" i broke him and that made it difficult for him			0
i was able to come through well in the tiebreaker			0
it always feels good to win at home			0
" if @entity3 can next beat @entity54 's @entity53 in the semifinals of the @entity57 s event and then win it for a record - extending sixth time , he will qualify for the @entity60 in @entity61 with one tournament to spare -- next week 's @entity63			1
see the similarities between @entity3 and @entity24 that there has been doubt @entity3 might not participate in next month 's season - ender -- a tournament he has won six times since 2003 -- is a measure of how much he has struggled this year			1
if 2012 was his return to the top , a year in which he won @entity74 a record - equaling seventh time , regained the no. 1 ranking and broke the milestone for most weeks at the summit , then 2013 has been a major comedown			1
after reaching the semifinals at january 's @entity81 , he lost in the quarters at @entity83 , the second round at @entity74 and in the last 16 in @entity85			0
injuries and experiments with new rackets have taken the edge off his once invincible aura , giving players like @entity24 real hope that they can claim a never - to - be - forgotten scalp			0
@entity3 will next face a 23 - year - old ranked 40th in the world , with a 17 - 16 record this year			1
but @entity96 is showing a return to the form that helped him beat world @entity100 @entity99 in @entity102 in august , reaching his third @entity14 semifinal this season with a 7 - 6 ( 11 - 9 ) 6 - 4 win over @entity107 's @entity106			2
saturday 's other semi will be between defending champion @entity109 , who beat @entity3 in last year 's final , and @entity111 @entity110			1
@entity109 , who has already qualified for one of the eight places in @entity61 , became just the sixth @entity114 to register 300 career wins as he defeated qualifier @entity116 6 - 4 6 - 4			2
the world no. 5 , who now has a record of 300 - 120 , is seeking his fourth title this year			1
meanwhile , world no. 3 @entity121 continued the defense of his @entity124 title by reaching the semifinals with a 6 - 4 4 - 6 6 - 0 win over @entity129 fifth seed @entity127			1
the @entity130 will next play compatriot @entity131 , while @entity133 @entity132 and @entity134 will contest the other semi .			0

@entity18 reaches semifinals of his home @entity139 tournament
former world no. 1 defeats @entity24 , once hailed as his future *successor*
@entity3 will qualify for @entity60 if he wins title for sixth time
@entity109 , who beat him in last year 's @entity21 final , also advances
