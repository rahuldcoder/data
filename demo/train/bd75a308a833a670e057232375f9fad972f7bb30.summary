-- " @entity3 " may be the greatest movie @entity2 , and that reputation has only grown since its 1956 premiere			1
it boasted three major reasons for its stellar reputation : actor @entity8 , director @entity9 and the spectacular location shooting in @entity11 , @entity12			2
but perhaps the key ingredient to its success lies in the foundation of all creative endeavors : the story			1
" @entity3 " is a mix of truth and legend , obsession and violence -- played out on the rim of a growing nation			1
a young white girl is abducted by warring @entity26 and assimilated into the tribe , while a vengeful uncle launches a years - long quest to find her			1
modern directors like @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 have sung the film 's praises and borrowed its themes of racial hatred , obsession and redemption			1
for the first time , this movie -- and the true story of the girl , @entity42 -- is fully chronicled , in @entity45 's new book " @entity3 : the making of an @entity47 legend " ( @entity48 )			1
the author , a former @entity51 foreign correspondent and now director of the @entity53 at @entity55 's journalism school , brings a reporter 's sparkling eye for nuanced detail and context to explore the film 's creation			1
it is a winning account filled with larger - than - life characters : women and men who share the power to endure through personal and creative trial			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity45 recently about his @entity70 best - seller			1
@entity0 : this is a chronicle of myths and truths meshed together			2
was your goal in writing this book to divide them ? @entity45 : as a journalist , we 're always trying to separate fact from fiction as best we can , but the farther back in time we go , the more dangerous an exercise that is			1
i never pretended that i was going to be able to provide a definitive version of the kidnapping of @entity87 in 1836 by @entity88			2
it was more that i was going to put things into the right perspective			2
when i started out , i had n't planned on doing any of that			2
i was just going to do a making - of - the - movie book			1
but i quickly found that there was a story that it was loosely based on and that there were all these layers			1
once i went there , there was no escape			2
@entity0 : the @entity2 is seen as essential to understanding the @entity47 identity			2
@entity45 : novelist and screenwriter @entity102 takes that true story and changes the focus in the movie from the kidnapped little girl to the people who were searching for her over the years			1
( director ) @entity9 put a real emphasis on the uncle who searches for her , because he asked @entity8 to play the character			2
so they deepened and darkened that character			0
and they go on to make a movie that is really about the impact of the kidnapping and of the violence of the @entity88 / @entity121 wars -- the impact on the pioneer families			0
by the early 1950s , the @entity2 had become a deeply embedded film genre			1
it has its own myths -- the themes of the lone gunman , the laconic guy on horseback , the @entity26 fighter			0
and @entity9 was the ultimate @entity2 myth - maker			0
@entity132 gives us both @entity8 in all his charismatic glory and at the same time , undermining this myth all through this movie			0
he gives us the great hero , and yet the great hero is on this quest that is very dangerous and one that becomes almost homicidal			0
@entity0 : @entity42 's story of survival was incredible -- was she a victim of competing cultures ? @entity45 : @entity121 history has different ways of thinking about her			1
she 's the @entity88 white princess and in a sense they 've glorified her , especially in recent history , as this tough @entity121 woman who is a survivor and comes through the ordeal in high spirits			1
painting her as the ultimate victim has its problems , too , because victims are n't very interesting , are they ? @entity42 was a victim of the war because she was damaged and traumatized by both sides			1
first , these @entity88 and @entity162 come along in 1836 , they murder her father and grandfather in front of her , they haul her off with four other young people			1
she does n't know if they 're going to kill her , they speak a foreign language			0
she spends 24 years as a @entity88 and then a second traumatic event			0
this time @entity171 and @entity172 descend on the little camp she 's in			1
they kill the people around her , they haul her off again			0
she never sees her @entity88 husband or her two @entity88 sons again			0
so really she 's wrenched , and both sides feel they have a right to do this , they feel that she should be grateful for this in some way			1
i see her as a symbol of the damage and the violence of this protracted @entity88 / @entity191 war			0
when it became clear to her family that she was miserable , she became an embarrassment to them , and they packed her off to a sawmill in @entity121			0
this onetime celebrity died in obscurity			0
@entity0 : the movie was ignored at first to a large extent , then later fully appreciated			0
what changed ? @entity45 : it initially got pretty good reviews , but nobody was digging into the layers of this movie , especially with racism and gender			1
it was before its time			0
it starts emerging , i 'd say , in the 1970s			0
@entity31 and @entity32 -- it was very formative for them			1
they quoted from it in many of their own films			0
it 's an enduring film -- it 's a beautiful piece of visual storytelling			1
yet it 's so ambiguous , and it 's about such important themes , not just racism and sexism , but also about this conflict between love and hate that 's going on in the movie			2
@entity0 : you write that what entranced you most were the @entity88			0
@entity45 : they 're such a fascinating group			1
they were up on the limestone plains , it was a real hard life			2
they were great horsemen , developed an empire , they were raiders and traders			0
and there were never that many of them , the tribes started kidnapping basically to replenish their population			0
they treated their enemies with great cruelty at times and yet they treated each other with great love and dignity			0
@entity251 's ( @entity26 and white ) families are still around , they have annual separate family reunions			2
@entity0 : tell us about @entity9			0
@entity45 : @entity9 was a tough guy			1
he was a lifelong alcoholic , but he was a great filmmaker			0
he managed to get this loyal band of actors and craftsmen around him , people who worked for him time and time again			0
he could be very abusive to them			0
at the same time , they would bleed for him			0
they knew that @entity132 was special and that the kind of films he was making were enduring			0
@entity8 knew he would be stretched here as an actor			0
@entity0 : this is @entity8 's movie			2
@entity45 : i think it 's his greatest role			1
a lot of us have a problem with @entity8			0
we have this vision of him as this guy in the 1960s and 1970s who was very right - wing , very @entity275 , a caricature			0
but before he was that guy , he was this very supple and interesting character			0
on the one hand , he 's @entity8 -- he 's very charismatic and we 're rooting for him to succeed on his quest and yet , what is the quest ? our white knight is planning to kill the young damsel			1
he 's very burdened by this mission , but he 's driven by vengeance and his brand of justice			2
@entity0 : it 's a pretty amazing cast of characters			2
@entity45 : in many ways , they 're all storytellers , they 're all trying to explain themselves through stories and trying to find a safe place in the world			1
for @entity42 and her @entity88 son @entity297 , it 's trying to survive			1
for @entity299 and @entity132 , it 's about turning this into art. i took great joy in studying these storytellers			2
it 's a great @entity47 story they 're telling and it 's one that 's still being told by the families .			1
