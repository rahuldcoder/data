-- one @entity1 will win @entity2			0
that much is guaranteed after the @entity6 , coached by @entity1 , and the @entity7 , led by his brother @entity8 , beat their respective foes in conference championship games sunday			1
those wins mean the @entity13 will be the first siblings to face off as head coaches in the @entity17 's title contest and , in fact , for any major @entity20 professional sports championship			1
both teams rallied from halftime deficits on the road to earn berths in the @entity25 , which will be played february 3 in @entity26			2
@entity7 did it by reeling off 21 straight points to overcome @entity29 and the @entity30			1
it was sweet revenge for the @entity7 , who lost last year 's nail - biter @entity34 to the same @entity30 foe on the same @entity37 field in @entity38 , @entity39			1
a few hours earlier , the 49ers rallied from a 17 - 0 hole to defeat the @entity42 , who had posted the best regular season record in the @entity45			2
@entity8 joked to reporters , after the @entity7 ' win , that he and his brothers had a " few dreams " -- one of which may have been meeting up in the @entity25 -- as well " as a few fights ... just like all brothers			1
" " we 'll let the two teams duke it out , as much as possible , " @entity8 said , smiling			2
the @entity7 coach then made a point to talk about how proud he was of his brother @entity59 , as well as how much he admired the @entity61 team			1
" i 'd like to think that when you look at ( the ) two teams , you 're looking at mirror images , " @entity8 said , referring to the @entity25 foes			1
" it 's going to be a great football game			0
" @entity7 's dominant second half leads to win beyond their recent playoff history , @entity7 and @entity30 matched up earlier this season -- one in which the @entity7 came back from a late 9 - point deficit , winning on a last - second field goal by @entity73			1
still , victory sunday evening was hardly guaranteed			0
@entity30 had the superior regular record , not to mention a storied playoff pedigree having played in five @entity25 in the past 11 years			1
they also had @entity29 , who last sunday passed @entity77 as the quarterback with the most playoff wins ever			0
and the @entity30 started out strong , jumping to a 3 - 0 lead and -- after a @entity7 score -- entering halftime up 13 - 7			1
but the second half was all @entity7			2
the @entity7 scored touchdowns on their first three possessions , two of them on @entity87 touchdown passes to receiver @entity90			0
meanwhile , the vaunted @entity30 offense sputtered , hurt especially by a @entity93 fumble and two @entity29 interceptions			0
@entity7 ended up winning 28 - 13			1
" we came here last year and left with a bitter taste in our mouths , " @entity7 's @entity90 told reporters after the game			1
" we felt like this team took something away from us			0
and we wanted to come back and make that right			0
" @entity6 rally , hold on for 28 - 24 victory led by quarterbacks @entity77 and @entity105 , @entity61 was one of the @entity17 's top franchises through much of the 1980s and 1990s			1
but the @entity6 have n't been in the @entity25 in 1995 , and their 2000s were marred by mostly losing regular seasons			1
the team 's fortunes , however , have turned since the 2011 hiring of @entity1 , a former @entity17 quarterback himself who 'd been coaching at nearby @entity112			0
the next season , they made it to the @entity116 , only to fall to the eventual @entity25 winners , the @entity117			2
on sunday , trailing by three scores midway through the second quarter , @entity61 rallied for two quick touchdowns -- one on a @entity123 11 - yard run , the other on a four - yard reception by tight end @entity126			2
still , @entity42 maintained its slim advantage -- in part thanks to a missed field goal and a fumble by the 49ers @entity132 just inches from the end zone -- into the fourth quarter			0
but then , running back @entity134 scored from nine yards out to put @entity61 ahead 28 - 24			1
at this point , there were still just over eight minutes left in the game			0
@entity138 -- paced by quarterback @entity139 , known as " @entity139 " for his strong play in the waning minutes of games -- made a run			0
with just over a minute to go , the @entity42 got within striking distance of the goal line			0
but @entity61 defenders broke up two straight passes , effectively sealing the win			0
after the game , @entity61 linebacker @entity148 said the 49ers prevailed because they refused to give up and stuck together as a team , just as they have all season long			2
" one thing about our team all year long is that we continue to fight , " @entity148 told @entity153 , which broadcast the game			0
" we have an unbelievable team			0

new : @entity7 's @entity8 says he admires his brother @entity59 , the @entity6 ' coach
the two will be the first brothers to face off , as coaches , for a major @entity20 sports championship
@entity61 rallies from a big deficit to beat @entity42 28 - 24 in the @entity116 game
@entity7 shuts out @entity30 in the second half , winning 28 - 13 to reach the @entity25
