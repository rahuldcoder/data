-- a confluence of a hankering for fried chicken and hard times in the smuggling business means buckets of @entity7 are showing up on tables in @entity9			1
the idea to get the @entity12 fast - food staple into the hands of hungry @entity14 came from @entity15 , a food delivery service that opened in the @entity18 territory a few years ago , according to the @entity19			1
when employees last month had a taste for some finger - lickin ' good stuff , they called a friend just over the @entity9 border in @entity27 , @entity28 , and asked him to order some up			2
he did so and sent it to @entity9 through one of the hundreds of tunnels under the @entity9 - @entity28 border used to get goods into @entity9 prohibited by @entity39 restrictions , things such as weapons and cars			1
the transfer of fried chicken from @entity28 to @entity9 took three hours , not exactly fast food , but good enough for a territory where there are no @entity46 fast - food franchises , according to the @entity19 report			1
their appetites sated , " we asked ourselves , ' why do n't we provide this service for @entity14 ? ' " @entity52 , the financial manager of @entity15 , told the monitor			0
besides satisfying the cravings for chicken , the underground not - so - fast food service proves a point , @entity54 , an entrepreneur who started @entity15 , told @entity59			1
" i accepted this challenge to prove that @entity14 can be resilient despite the restrictions , " the @entity59 quoted him as saying			2
for the tunnel operators , fast food may help out with hard economic times			1
@entity39 has relaxed its embargo on @entity9 , so more goods are getting through legitimately			1
and @entity28 cracked down on the tunnels after 16 of its soldiers were killed in a raid on them last year , the monitor reported			0
so lower demand means lower prices			0
" bringing some meals like these would cost $ 200 or more three years ago , but now they do n't even cost $ 20 , " tunnel operator @entity74 told the monitor			2
a bucket of chicken goes for about $ 30 in @entity9 , about three times the price in @entity28 , according to the media reports			1
besides the chicken , fries , coleslaw and apple pie are available , according to the @entity59			0
@entity88 promotes the service on its @entity91 page and usually makes the runs under the border when it can get 30 or so orders to make things worthwhile , the @entity59 reported			0
and even if the chicken 's a bit cold and the fries somewhat soggy , customers apparently are n't complaining			0
eating @entity7 " has been a dream , " @entity99 told the monitor			0
" and this company has made my dream come true			0
" @entity9 runners barred from @entity106 marathon			2

*imports* to @entity9 under @entity39 restrictions
there reportedly are no @entity46 fast - food franchises in @entity9
chicken smuggling helps tunnel operator through hard times , report says
smuggling costs triple price of chicken , according to report
