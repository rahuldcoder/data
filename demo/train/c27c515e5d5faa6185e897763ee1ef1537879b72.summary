-- @entity1 does n't do austerity			1
while recession - hit @entity3 continues to wrestle with the financial crisis , @entity1 has spent big again by making @entity7 one of the most expensive football players -- if not the most expensive -- in history			1
the clubs did n't reveal the official fee sunday when his switch was confirmed			0
@entity15 's most illustrious club has previous experience in this regard and since the turn of the century , @entity1 has broken the world transfer record on at least four occasions , with two - time president @entity21 eager to recruit what he refers to as " @entity24 " star names			1
but even @entity21 , the man for whom money is no object , momentarily winced at the fee commanded by @entity28 for @entity7 earlier in august			1
" â ‚ ¬ 100 million seems a lot to me , " @entity21 told @entity29			0
eventually , he refused to blink and in a country where unemployment is at 26.3 % , the nine - time @entity15 champion has once again raised the bar in the transfer market			0
" @entity7 's a very good player , " @entity37 coach @entity36 told reporters a week ago when asked about @entity1 's pursuit of the @entity41 winger			1
" but the numbers are a lack of respect to the world in general			2
" at a time when most of @entity3 does n't have two euros to rub together , you 'd have thought @entity1 's level of spending might also rile @entity51 -- but not a bit of it			1
the view among many @entity1 fans is that the club is a private enterprise and can do what it likes with the money that it has			1
their disdain is for @entity3 's political and financial establishment , rather than @entity21 and @entity1			1
" what is truly immoral is how our leaders and banks steal from us , although if i think about it i 'm not sure why i am surprised			0
they are just a reflection of the society in this country , " 34 - year - old warehouseman @entity69 told @entity0			0
" i consider it entertainment , something far removed from my day to day			0
i 've never been interested in the financial aspects of football and it has n't impacted on my support for @entity1 , " added @entity77 , a psychologist and long - term season ticket holder at @entity1 's @entity80 stadium			1
" nothing must change your hobbies , " added 36 - year - old journalist @entity85 , who is back working having been unemployed for four months			0
@entity77 and @entity89 are not alone in their views			0
fellow @entity1 fan @entity92 , who regularly attends the team 's home matches , detaches the frivolity of football from the financial hardships faced by most @entity3			1
" it 's important to contextualize and not mix both , " explains 32 - year - old marketing manager @entity92			0
" as high as the fee may seem , i 'm sure that the decision makers in @entity1 would not spend this sum of money without being sure of a return on the investment			1
" however , @entity92 was keen to explain how the @entity3 people have had to adjust to living in unsettling times			2
" it 's hard to not be affected by things ; one can not help but be moved by families being removed from their homes by force , family and friends being laid - off , social cutbacks and an uncertain economic future , " he added			0
" the doubt is not good for the general state of mind but we 've learned and are learning to cope with uncertainty			0
" not every fan finds it so easy to turn a blind eye to football 's excesses			0
@entity3 professional football has combined debts of $ 5.4 billion , while according to @entity3 economist @entity129 , @entity1 's debts are approaching $ 800 million			1
" as a @entity3 citizen i think it is absolutely immoral , " said marketing manager @entity130			2
" i do n't believe a football club can stop paying millions but a small family company must pay or they will have to close the business			0
if you take a look you 'll be able to find every @entity3 team owes a huge quantity			2
" another @entity1 supporter , @entity140 , who is currently unemployed , goes to @entity1 's matches when he can			1
although unsettled by the huge sums of money involved in the transfer , @entity140 understands that , ultimately , @entity1 is free to operate as it pleases			2
" it 's a hell of a lot of money and it makes me uncomfortable that a sports person can generate this type of transfer fee , " said @entity140			0
" but with the club being a private company they can offer what they want , with a view to recouping the fee over time and turning a profit with the money generated by @entity7			1
" telecommunications worker @entity159 , 31 , who has been forced to rent two hours from @entity1 due to the economic crisis , added : " @entity21 is a businessman and knows he will win twice with advertising , because @entity7 is a good player			1
" @entity162 is a worker on the @entity1 underground who has not had a pay rise in six years			2
he thinks the money spent on the @entity7 deal is symptomatic of widespread financial irresponsibility in @entity3 football			1
" there are degrees of immorality about this fee and the money being generated by the bigger teams in the modern game , " said @entity162			0
" most clubs in @entity3 live financially beyond their means and as long as the football governing bodies turn a blind eye , and they get special treatment from the @entity3 revenue system , this wo n't change			2
" the banks seem to be happy to lend the major clubs these sums of money and they are treated in a way other companies are n't			0
" @entity7 's arrival is the latest example of @entity1 and archrival @entity37 importing expensive , top - level players , while other less wealthy @entity194 clubs try and keep pace			1
many of these smaller clubs are seeing the best @entity3 players depart for foreign leagues			2
the situation within @entity3 football has become so dire that @entity202 , an armchair @entity1 fan who attends games sporadically , finds himself drawn to city rival @entity204			1
" i watch less and less @entity3 football as the league is a competition between just two teams , " reasoned @entity205			2
" i tend to watch more @entity212 football			0
i 've started to become fond of teams such as @entity204 who do well with inferior financial resources			0
" he considers the enormous @entity7 fee to be " an embarrassment and a shame			2
" " it does nothing to promote true sporting values and does nothing to add to community spirit , it 's pure business , " he argued			0
" if they pay this fee it 's because they know that it will be profitable via tv rights , image rights , etc. " it turns me off @entity1			1
" real hope the signing of @entity7 will help the team win a record 10th @entity212 , the fabled , sought - after " @entity238			1
" if the @entity241 scores the winning goal in the final of this season 's @entity212 , would @entity205 be able to put aside his price tag and celebrate ? " inevitably i 'll celebrate it , " he conceded			0
" once the money has been paid , one has to take advantage of the situation			0
