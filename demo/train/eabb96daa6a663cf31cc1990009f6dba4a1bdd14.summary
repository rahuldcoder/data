" that will probably get her pumped up , and she 's on a comeback , and she has nothing to lose and everything to gain			2
she 's also won this tournament before			2
" so it 's not going to be an easy match for me , for sure			2
but i do n't want to stop at the quarters			0

that run has only been surpassed this decade by her older sister @entity48 ( 35 wins ) and @entity51 ( 32 )			0
" i honestly do n't even consider it a streak , " @entity2 said			2
" every day , everybody 's like , ' you 're on this streak			0
' but for me it 's about winning the matches			2
" it 's like i do n't care to be on a streak ; i do n't care not to be on a streak			0
i just want to win this match			0
if that means it 's going to be consecutive and it 's going to be winning streaks , that 's great			1
" but at the end of the day , i just want to hold up the winner 's trophy and whatever it takes to get there			0

" i do n't care if i 'm an underdog or not , i just go out there and try to play my game			0
