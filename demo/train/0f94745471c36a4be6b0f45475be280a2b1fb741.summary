-- do n't be confused , @entity1			1
you did not wake up in a fraternity house			1
you are not still in college			1
those celluloid - ball - throwing , beer - chugging patrons invading the @entity7 and @entity8 are not trying to scare you			1
they are probably just members of @entity10 -- wednesday night 's winners of the annual @entity12			1
@entity13 and @entity14 came out on top after 22 games to take home the $ 50,000 prize , money that the recent @entity20 at @entity22 graduates will certainly be able to use			1
" it 'll get me by for now , " @entity14 said after the win			1
he said the secret to his team 's success in the tournament was " staying sober to play well consistently			1
" not always an easy task in a game with " beer " in it name			2
beer pong , or @entity34 as it is called on many college campuses , is played with two teams standing at opposite ends of a table			1
at each end of the table , ten 16 - ounce cups , filled with roughly 4 ounces of beer or another liquid , are placed in a bowling - pin formation			2
each team takes turns tossing beer pong balls ( similar to table tennis balls ) at their opponent 's cup formation			2
if a ball goes into a cup , the cup is removed from the game , and its contents are usually imbibed by the opponent			2
the first team to knock out all of their opponent 's cups wins			2
@entity13 and @entity14 learned to play beer pong the same place most people do -- in college			1
it was n't until recently that the two started playing competitively and realized they were actually pretty good			2
their move from casual beer pong players to tournament competitors mimics that of @entity72 co-founder @entity71 's decision to establish a competitive beer pong league			2
but he insists he and his business partners were n't the first ones to think of organizing it			0
" we 're just the only people to actually carry it out , " he said , laughing			0
the world series , in its seventh and largest year , has drawn more than 1,000 players ( 450 teams ) from 48 @entity84 states and 14 countries			0
organization of a sport which for many college students is nothing more than a mindless drinking game may sound a little far - fetched , but @entity71 said it actually came quite easily to him and his college buddies , all members of the @entity88 swim team in the late 1990s			1
" we played a ton of beer pong , " he said			0
despite the popularity of the game on his campus and others , @entity71 said there was never really any way to measure a player 's skill level			0
" there were no organized tournaments , " @entity71 said , " we figured a lot of people thought they were pretty good , but might wonder , ' how good am i really ? ' " after graduating from college with a history degree , @entity71 said , his desire to become an entrepreneur paired with the game 's widespread popularity made for a perfect fit for the formation of a @entity72			1
the league established rules for the game , a regulation - size beer pong table , as well as a national ranking system similar to that for chess			0
competitors can move up and down in the rankings based on the ranking of those they beat			0
no surprise to @entity71 , his friends think his job is " pretty cool , " but overcoming stereotypes about the game has proved to be one of his greatest challenges			0
" people who did n't play beer pong in college do n't really get it , " he said			1
" it 's tricky trying to convince them it 's something that people take seriously			0
" even his own parents have mixed emotions			0
" my dad loves it , " @entity71 said			0
" my mom thinks it 's debauchery			0
" @entity71 said the tournament attracts a " mixed bag " of people who all " happen to be good at beer pong			0
" the @entity72 's latest development is an app for the @entity156 smart phone that he says will bring competitive beer pong to even larger crowds			0
the most casual backyard beer pong player can log on and track their wins on the league 's website			0
at the end of the day , @entity71 said , " it 's really just a sport that happens to involve alcohol			1
