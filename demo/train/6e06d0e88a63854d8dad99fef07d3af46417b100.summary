@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's mother filed a lawsuit wednesday accusing @entity6 of causing her son 's death by pushing him to rehearse for his comeback concerts despite poor health			1
@entity12 's suit , filed in @entity13 , claimed that the concert production company controlled @entity4 's health because it hired and directed dr. @entity16			1
@entity16 faces trial on an involuntary manslaughter charge for administering drugs to the pop star that the coroner ruled caused @entity4 's death in june 25 , 2009			1
the suit claims that @entity16 was " selected by , hired by , and controlled by @entity6 , " a worldwide concert promotion and production company			1
@entity4 signed a contract in january 2009 with @entity6 for a series of comeback concerts in @entity30 that would begin in july 2009			2
" indeed , @entity6 demanded and required that @entity4 be treated by this particular doctor to ensure that @entity4 would attend all rehearsals and shows on the tour , " the suit said			1
the lawsuit contends that the concert production company had a legal responsibility to " treat him safely and to not put him in harms ' way			0
" " @entity6 , despite its knowledge of @entity4 's physical condition , breached those duties by putting its desire for massive profits from the tour over the health and safety of @entity4 , " it said			1
the company failed to provide @entity16 with cardio - pulmonary resuscitation equipment and a nurse as was promised in his employment contract , the suit said			1
@entity56 , a partner in the law firm representing @entity6 , said @entity4 's suit " is inaccurate , unsubstantiated and meritless			1
" " dr. @entity16 was mr. @entity4 's longtime personal physician , " @entity56 said in a statement			2
" @entity6 did not choose him , hire him or supervise him			0
that said , and in honor of our professional relationship with mr. @entity4 and his estate , we will have no further public statements			0
" the autopsy report on @entity4 's death noted the lack of medical equipment in the @entity0 home where @entity16 administered a powerful anesthetic to help @entity4 sleep during several nights before his death			1
the lawsuit outlines the last week of @entity4 's life , which it said included a visited to his home by @entity6 ceo @entity6 on june 18 , 2009			1
@entity6 went there to meet with @entity4 and @entity16 after the singer failed to show up for a rehearsal , it said			2
" @entity6 threatened that if @entity4 missed any further rehearsals , they were going to ' pull the plug ' on the show , " it said			2
" @entity6 told @entity16 that he had to make sure @entity4 got to rehearsals			2
" " they said it was to be ' tough love ' and that they had read @entity4 the ' riot act , ' " the suit said			0
when @entity4 finally showed up for the rehearsal at 9:30 p.m. , " he was visibly shaken , " it said			0
" witnesses present at that rehearsal confirm that @entity4 was not himself that day			0
" later that evening , @entity16 administered a " cocktail of @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 in order to get him to sleep , " the lawsuit said			0
" @entity4 was freezing cold " at a rehearsal two days before his death , the suit said			2
" his assistants had to give him several shirts to wear under his long heavy coat			0
" @entity4 's shivering and disorientation continued the last day before his death , it said			1
" @entity6 was well aware of his condition but did not postpone any rehearsals , nor did @entity6 relent in its demands that @entity4 continue to maintain the grueling rehearsal schedule , " the suit said			1
" rather than react reasonably and relax the rehearsal schedule so @entity4 could recuperate from his physical problems , @entity6 insisted that he attend every rehearsal in a grueling schedule , threatening that if he missed even one more , they would cancel the tour			2
" his mother 's lawsuit described @entity4 in his last months as " confused , easily frightened , unable to remember , obsessive , and disoriented			0
" " he had impaired memory , loss of appetite , dehydration , and absence of energy , " it said			0
" he was cold and shivering during the summer rehearsals for this show			0
" the company " should have known that it was jeopardizing @entity4 's health and safety by assuming control over the doctor - patient relationship between @entity4 and @entity16 , and by directing and influencing @entity16 to act without regard to medical safety standards , " it said			1
@entity140 , the pop star 's father , is not a direct party to the lawsuit			0
he filed a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity16 this summer			0
. @entity2 's @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
