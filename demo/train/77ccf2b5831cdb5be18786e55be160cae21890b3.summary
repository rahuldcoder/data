@entity0 -- @entity2 , who lost his son @entity3 -- a @entity0 firefighter -- on september 11 , 2001 , seems cautiously optimistic that the men again charged in the deadly attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people will finally go to trial			1
" eleven years later and the families are still awaiting justice , " he told @entity1			2
" hopefully , the trial will move forward			2
let the world see what these men are like			2
" @entity2 is among the victims ' relatives notified that terrorism charges were refiled wednesday against accused 9/11 mastermind @entity16 , @entity17 and three others			1
if convicted , the men could face the death penalty			1
they were first charged in 2008 , but their cases were suspended when the @entity22 administration attempted to move the case to federal court in @entity0 , only to run into a political firestorm			1
in 2009 , @entity2 made a trip to the @entity28 @entity27 at @entity29 , @entity30 , where the defendants are being held , in an effort to watch and hear them speak before a military commission			1
" i am the mastermind of 9/11 , not @entity37 , " @entity16 told the presiding judge			1
" we do n't care about capital punishment or a life sentence			0
we are doing jihad for the cause of @entity43			0
" @entity2 said @entity16 seemed proud			1
@entity2 said he would like to attend a new trial , but is n't sure whether his name will be chosen since other families who have n't been to the naval base will be asked to attend			1
" some families might not want to go			0
seeing these evil men is n't easy , " he said			2
" it 's very hard to listen to them			0
" but he said that while he 's skeptical , he 's also hopeful that this time a trial will take place			0
president @entity22 , who has yet to make good on a pledge to close the detention camp , earned congressional scorn after vowing to move high - level detainees to stand trial in civilian courts			0
the move was followed by an outcry fueled mainly by conservatives who claimed that it would be an unnecessary security risk to move terror suspects from the island facility			0
the @entity22 administration countered that federal prosecutions had a record of success , including convictions and life sentences for so - called shoe bomber @entity72 , confessed @entity74 operative @entity73 and blind @entity76 cleric @entity75 , who is serving a life sentence for inspiring the 1993 @entity79 bombing and for a thwarted plot to attack other @entity0 locations			1
" politics had a lot to do with this , " @entity2 said			1
" the victims of 9/11 are being victimized all over again because of this			1
and now , we 're back to where we were four years ago			0
politicians should be ashamed of themselves			0
" he says families have waited too long to see the 9/11 alleged conspirators stand trial			2
" for me , i ca n't wait for the day justice is served on them , " he added			0
" i want the world to see it			0
" @entity2 said the government has already asked him whether he 'd be willing to face @entity16 and his co-defendants in court and make a victim impact statement			1
" of course , " he said			0
but , " it does n't change anything because ( his son ) wo n't come walking back into the room			2
