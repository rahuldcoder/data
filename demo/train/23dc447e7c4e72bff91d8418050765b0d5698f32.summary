@entity0 -- thirty - two of the world 's best football teams are now competing for the iconic golden @entity6 trophy -- but the planet 's most populous nation is not among them			1
@entity9 failed to qualify for the " beautiful game 's " showpiece event in @entity11			2
in fact @entity9 's @entity6 dream turned into a nightmare as early as 2011 , when it was eliminated in a regional qualifying round			1
but for all the interest in football in this country of more than one billion people , it is a huge source of frustration that they ca n't field a competitive national team			1
" @entity9 's weakness in football is a pain point and there is certainly an ambition to improve , " said @entity26 , president of @entity27			1
indeed , a multitude of @entity33 -- from the state president , to a @entity36 student , to a @entity0 taxi driver -- share one @entity33 dream : that @entity9 will one day win in the @entity6 finals			1
finals flop @entity9 reached the finals only once back in 2002			1
i remember that heady year			0
there was a heroes ' welcome for the national team , many of whom became icons with fat commercial endorsements			1
there was deleterious display of national pride accompanied by soaring expectations for @entity9			2
but their debut turned out to be an embarrassing dud : they were knocked out after the group stage without scoring a single goal			0
still , these setbacks have not deflated the football fever here			0
" there is a huge following for international football in @entity9 because local fans celebrate global talent , " said @entity26 , a long - time @entity0 resident who plays football in a local amateur league			1
" @entity70 is about ' nationalism ' at its finest , absent politics , and that 's what makes it enjoyable			0
" global game @entity33 football fans have been enjoying the action in @entity11 despite matches taking place after midnight , @entity0 time			1
by hook or by crook , local fans are finding ways to stay up late for the games			0
some took paid leave , others found excuses to stay home , such as getting doctors to sign sick - leave certificates			0
a man asked to take the day off ostensibly to attend a teacher - parent conference			0
some managers say work place productivity has dropped lately			0
a few companies have simply conceded defeat , agreeing to a staggered work schedule to allow for some employees to stay in late , and come in late			0
" the @entity6 matches are played in the wee hours , " said @entity99 , a venture - capital manager			0
" if the staff ca n't get good sleep , work will be affected , so i pushed back working hours , hoping to arouse their work enthusiasm and efficiency			0
" " @entity70 is the biggest sporting event on the planet , so regardless of where you are in the world , you ca n't escape the excitement and passion surrounding the event , and @entity9 is no exception , " said @entity109 , director at @entity110 , who manages partnerships for football icon , @entity113 , on behalf of his own management , @entity115			2
@entity109 credits football 's popularity here to an increasingly popular @entity33 professional league , and to the extensive media exposure of top - level players and games through tv and digital channels like @entity132 and @entity133			1
" they bring the game into the homes of hundreds of millions of fans , who are now engaged around the @entity6 , " he said			2
cash kicks enthusiasm for the game brings commercial windfalls			0
the @entity6 advertising revenue for @entity142 , one of @entity9 's largest video websites is estimated to reach rmb100 million yuan ( $ 16 million ) , said its top executive @entity144			1
this summer alone cctv , the state television network , could rake in as much as rmb1.5 billion yuan ( $ 240 million ) in advertising revenue -- 50 % more than their earnings from the @entity148			0
" given the interest generated by the @entity6 , many companies are tapping into the passion and emotion created by the competition to connect with consumers , " said @entity109 , who recently accompanied @entity113 to @entity0			2
@entity155 has used its sponsorship with a @entity157 , where they took the trophy to over 90 countries and held consumer events			0
@entity162 's ran point of sale promotions , which offered @entity6 tickets to winners			2
other brands created various content , featuring international and national team players to connect the brand to the event			1
the competition for advertising and commerce is not limited to sports brands			0
on the eve of the @entity6 , an electric bike manufacturer in southern @entity9 brought @entity113 to @entity0 to hitch on the @entity6 bandwagon			1
" they knew local residents are crazy about football and a legend like @entity113 endorsing their brand make them more endearing , " explained @entity26			0
since the month - long competition opened in @entity11 , legions of @entity33 sports fans have been gathering for viewing parties in their living rooms , in factory and school dormitories , and in restaurants and bars , many of which have opened late for the fans to watch matches live on @entity33 television			1
of course , not all of these sleep - deprived folks are bona fide football fans			2
a posting on @entity200 , @entity9 's largest search engine , noted that the @entity33 have recently coined the word " wei qiumi , " or " fake soccer fans , " referring to people who watch the game only once in a while , who care more about the final scores rather than enjoying the actual games , and who think celebrity players play a more important role in matches than the coaches .			1

@entity9 's national team has reached the @entity6 finals only once , back in 2002
@entity33 football fans are still crazy about the @entity6 , doing everything they can to watch *overnight* games
the @entity6 *audience* generates huge revenue for companies in @entity9
