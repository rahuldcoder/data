@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 , @entity3 , delivered the official @entity5 response to president @entity6 's @entity8 speech on tuesday night			1
here is a transcript of @entity2 's speech			1
i 'm congressman @entity2 from @entity13 , @entity3 , and chairman here at the @entity15			1
president @entity6 just addressed a congressional chamber filled with many new faces			1
one face we did not see tonight was that of our friend and colleague , congresswoman @entity22 of @entity23			2
we all miss @entity24 and her cheerful spirit , and we are praying for her return to the @entity15 chamber			2
earlier this month , president @entity6 spoke movingly at a memorial event for the six people who died on that violent morning in @entity30			1
still , there are no words that can lift the sorrow that now engulfs the families and the friends of the fallen			2
what we can do is assure them that the nation is praying for them , that , in the words of the psalmist , the lord heals the broken - hearted and binds up their wounds , and that over time grace will replace grief			2
as @entity24 continues to make encouraging progress , we must keep her and the others in our thoughts as we attend to the work now before us			1
tonight , the president focused a lot of attention on our economy in general , and on our deficit and debt in particular			1
he was right to do so , and some of his words were reassuring			2
as chairman of the @entity15 , i assure you that we want to work with the president to restrain federal spending			1
in one of our first acts in the new majority , @entity15 @entity5 voted to cut @entity66 ' own budget			1
and just today , the @entity15 voted to restore the spending discipline that @entity0 sorely needs			1
a few years ago , reducing spending was important			1
today , it 's imperative			1
we face a crushing burden of debt			2
the debt will soon eclipse our entire economy and grow to catastrophic levels in the years ahead			2
on this current path , when my three children -- who are now 6 , 7 , and 8 years old -- are raising their own children , the federal government will double in size , and so will the taxes they pay			1
no economy can sustain such high levels of debt and taxation			2
the next generation will inherit a stagnant economy and a diminished country			0
frankly , it 's one of my greatest concerns as a parent , and i know many of you feel the same way			1
our debt is the product of acts by many presidents and many congresses over many years			0
no one person or party is responsible for it			0
there 's no doubt the president came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation			1
unfortunately , instead of restoring the fundamentals of economic growth , he engaged in a stimulus spending spree that not only failed to deliver on his promise to create jobs , but also plunged us even deeper into debt			1
the facts are clear : since taking office , president @entity6 has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 % for domestic government agencies , an 84 % increase when you include the failed stimulus			1
all of this new government spending was sold as " investment			1
" yet after two years , the unemployment rate remains above 9 % , and government has added over $ 3 trillion to our debt			0
then the president and his party made matters even worse , by creating a new open - ended health care entitlement			1
what we already know about the president 's health care law is this : costs are going up , premiums are rising , and millions of people will lose the coverage they currently have			1
job creation is being stifled by all of its taxes , penalties , mandates and fees			0
businesses and unions from around the country are asking the @entity6 administration for waivers from the mandates			1
@entity0 should not be in the business of picking winners and losers			0
the president mentioned the need for regulatory reform to ease the burden on @entity166 businesses			1
and we think his health care law would be a great place to start			0
last week , @entity15 @entity5 voted for a full repeal of this law , as we pledged to do , and we will work to replace it with fiscally responsible , patient - centered reforms that actually reduce costs and expand coverage			1
health care spending is driving the explosive growth of our debt			1
and the president 's law is accelerating our country toward bankruptcy			1
our debt is out of control			0
what was a fiscal challenge is now a fiscal crisis			0
we can not deny it			0
instead we must , as @entity166 , confront it responsibly			1
and that is exactly what @entity5 pledge to do			1
@entity166 are skeptical of both political parties , and that skepticism is justified , especially when it comes to spending			1
so hold all of us accountable			0
in this very room , the @entity15 will produce , debate and advance a budget			0
last year , in an unprecedented failure , @entity66 chose not to pass or even propose a budget			0
the spending spree continued unchecked			1
we owe you a better choice and a different vision			0
our forthcoming budget is our obligation to you , to show you how we would do things differently , how we will cut spending to get the debt down , help create jobs and prosperity , and reform government programs			1
if we act soon , and if we act responsibly , people in and near retirement will be protected			1
these budget debates are not just about the programs of government ; they 're also about the purpose of government			0
so i 'd like to share with you the principles that guide us			0
they are anchored in the wisdom of the founders , in the spirit of the @entity227 , and in the words of the @entity229			0
they have to do with the importance of limited government and with the blessing of self - government			0
we believe government 's role is both vital and limited , to defend the nation from attack and provide for the common defense , to secure our borders , to protect innocent life , to uphold our laws and constitutional rights , to ensure domestic tranquility and equal opportunity , and to provide a safety net -- to help provide a safety net for those who can not provide for themselves			2
we believe that the government has an important role to create the conditions that promote entrepreneurship , upward mobility and individual responsibility			0
we believe , as our founders did , that the pursuit of happiness depends on individual liberty , and individual liberty requires limited government			0
limited government also means effective government			0
when government takes on too many tasks , it usually does n't do any of them very well			0
it 's no coincidence that trust in government is at an all - time low now that the size of government is at an all - time high			2
the president and the @entity273 leadership have shown , by their actions , that they believe government needs to increase its size and its reach , its price tag and its power			2
whether sold as stimulus or repackaged as investment , their actions show they want a federal government that controls too much , taxes too much and spends too much in order to do too much			2
and during the last two years , that is exactly what we have gotten -- along with record deficits and debt -- to the point where the president is now urging @entity66 to increase the debt limit			2
we believe the days of business as usual must come to an end			0
we hold to a couple of simple convictions : endless borrowing is not a strategy			0
spending cuts have to come first			2
our nation is approaching a tipping point			0
we are at a moment where , if government 's growth is left unchecked and unchallenged , @entity166 's best century will be considered our past century			1
this is a future in which we will transform our social safety net into a hammock , which lulls able - bodied people into lives of complacency and dependency			0
depending on bureaucracy to foster innovation , competitiveness and wise consumer choices has never worked , and it wo n't work now			2
we need to chart a new course			0
speaking candidly , as one citizen to another , we still have time , but not much time			0
if we continue down our current path , we know what our future will be			0
just take a look at what 's happening to @entity330 , @entity331 , the @entity332 and other nations in @entity334			2
they did n't act soon enough , and now their governments have been forced to impose painful austerity measures , large benefit cuts to seniors and huge tax increases on everybody			2
their day of reckoning has arrived			0
ours is around the corner			0
that is why we have to act now			2
some people will back away from this challenge			0
but i see this challenge as an opportunity to rebuild what @entity351 called the central ideas of the republic			0
we believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people , of every background , to succeed and prosper			0
under this approach , the spirit of initiative -- not political clout -- determines who succeeds			0
millions of families have fallen on hard times not because of our ideals of free enterprise , but because our leaders failed to live up to those ideals , because of poor decisions made in @entity0 and @entity374 that caused a financial crisis , squandered our savings , broke our trust and crippled our economy			0
today , a similar kind of irresponsibility threatens not only our livelihoods , but our way of life			0
we need to reclaim our @entity166 system of limited government , low taxes , reasonable regulations and sound money , which has blessed us with unprecedented prosperity			1
and it has done more to help the poor than any other economic system ever designed			2
that 's the real secret to job creation , not borrowing and spending more money in @entity0			1
limited government and free enterprise have helped make @entity166 the greatest nation on @entity397			1
these are not easy times , but @entity166 is an exceptional nation			1
in all the chapters of human history , there has never been anything quite like @entity166			1
the @entity166 story has been cherished , advanced and defended over the centuries			1
and it now falls to this generation to pass onto our children a nation that is stronger , more vibrant , more decent and better than the one we inherited			0
thank you , and good night .			0
