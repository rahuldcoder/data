-- it can be argued that the biggest star of the @entity4 season so far is not one of the six world champion drivers on the grid , it 's not one of the legendary teams taking part -- it 's not even one of their design geniuses			1
the biggest talking point this year is the humble tire			1
not because it has extraordinary qualities never seen before in motorsport rubber ; quite the opposite , in fact			0
sole supplier @entity21 has purposefully provided product that breaks down quicker than ever			1
seven - time world champion @entity23 told @entity0 they are " like driving on raw eggs			0
" the result has been seven different winners in eight races as drivers struggle to find the best way to conserve their allocation			2
" one of the key points of the season is that @entity21 has been very aggressive and made tires to wear that much during a race , " the @entity33 company 's test driver @entity31 told @entity0			1
" when you decrease this grip level , when you decrease this contact by wearing the tire a lot , you can not put the power down , you can not brake , you can not corner efficiently enough and you lose performance			0
" it has been difficult for the teams to find the best strategy , and that has been key to all the overtakings and the excitement of the races			1
" @entity21 chief backs tire critic @entity23 @entity55 gave @entity0 an insiders ' look into @entity21 's tires ahead of this weekend 's @entity60 @entity59 at @entity61			1
" it has very little to do with a road car tire , actually , " said the @entity62 , who had one season in @entity4 with the former @entity65 ( now known as @entity66 ) in 2010			1
" this tire is made to produce an enormous amount of grip , five times more than a road car and to last much less			0
a road car can last for 30,000 kilometers and an @entity4 race is only 300			2
this tire is made to last between 100 and 150 km. " @entity23 is struggling to restore the dominance he had at @entity75 when @entity76 dominated the @entity4 tire scene , though the 43 - year - old @entity79 's third - placing in @entity78 last month suggests he is finally learning to manage the rubber			1
@entity81 offers support to under - fire @entity21 meanwhile , other lesser - known drivers are taking the chance to make their name on the circuit			1
@entity23 's @entity90 teammate @entity89 claimed his first career win in @entity92 , @entity88 ' pastor @entity87 did the same at the @entity93 @entity59 , while @entity95 's @entity94 and @entity96 of @entity97 have earned their first podium placings			0
former world champion @entity99 has proven quick to adapt on his return to @entity4 , but the driver who has taken the best advantage of the situation is @entity104			1
faced with the prospect of a season struggling to compete in an ill - equipped @entity75 , the two - time titleholder has stunned experts by moving to the top of the standings with two wins and two other podiums while never finishing outside the top 10			1
@entity4 legend : @entity21 tires are dangerous " it 's exactly what makes the difference between a world champion and a common racer , " @entity55 said			1
" you can see that @entity104 has done an amazing job to understand the tires from the beginning of the season until now			2
" for a racing driver one of the most difficult things is to get the most grip out of the tire because you have to feel it , actually have to feel that corner before you arrive there , you actually have to feel that brake so you know how much speed you can carry -- and that 's totally dependent on the tire performance			2
" and on the other hand it is very difficult for you to understand how to go as fast as possible but also preserve the tire , sometimes to drive at 90 - 95 % to extend the life of the tire			0
" should @entity4 be so unpredictable ? @entity21 returned to @entity4 as sole tire supplier in 2011 in a three - year deal after @entity76 ended its involvement in the elite division of motorsport			1
its head of motorsport @entity147 admits there was a conscious decision to put tires in the limelight			2
" we always have a tough job getting people to talk about tires			0
in a competition situation , battling another manufacturer , when you 're winning no - one talks about you , but if you 're losing you can be sure people will blame it on the tires ! " he said in an interview with the magazine of the @entity160 , which @entity0 sponsors			2
" in a control tire situation , such as we have , unless you 're having issues with safety they do n't get talked about at all			0
this was our way to try to become a discussion point of the weekend			0
it helps justify the investment you make in the sport			0
" @entity147 said that , even without the @entity21 factor , the 12 competing teams are a lot closer in performance this year			2
" in past seasons we have seen some cars , even at the front , having maybe a half - a - second to a second advantage over the next cars			0
this year that gap covers 15 or 16 cars			0
that we did n't foresee , " he said			0
" it 's obviously very interesting to see so many cars in the mix. it 's good that we 're not sitting here with a third of the season over knowing who 's going to win the championship			0
" @entity202 's drivers @entity200 and @entity203 have yet to register a point this season , but the @entity60 - based team 's technical director @entity206 has been enjoying the challenge			1
" it provides an opportunity for us -- on a given day , on a given circuit , in the right ambient conditions -- to perform a little bit beyond where we are expected to perform , " @entity206 said			0
so what can the drivers expect at @entity61 for saturday 's qualifying and the race on sunday ? " it is one of the fastest tracks of the season and this means for the tires , a very high energy load , cornering , braking and acceleration , " @entity55 said			1
" my top two tips are : use the soft compound for qualifying for optimum grip and best performance ; and for the race , mix between the hard and the soft , also saving the tires as best they can , and attack at the right time			0
