-- rape is a crime in which , all too often , only the victim pays a price			1
in @entity6 , out of every 100 rapes , only 46 are reported to police and only three rapists will spend a day behind bars			2
to make matters worse , rapists tend to be serial criminals , so every one left on the streets is likely to commit still more attacks			0
on monday , in a big win for public safety and for victims of sexual violence , the @entity6 @entity16 handed down a decision in @entity22 v. @entity23 , a decision that will have a big impact on our nation 's ability to hold rapists accountable			1
following his arrest on assault charges in 2009 , @entity23 had his cheek swabbed , a painless five - second process , one that justice @entity34 in his majority opinion characterized as " a minor intrusion			1
" a crime lab analyzed the swab , and the resulting dna profile was entered into the @entity40 , or @entity40 , the federal database			1
@entity23 's @entity39 was linked to a 6 - year - old crime scene , and he was subsequently convicted for the rape of a 53 - year - old woman at gunpoint			1
@entity40 , by the way , contains the dna profiles of more than 10 million offenders , as well as a record of dna left at nearly half a million crime scenes			1
it has produced more than 205,000 hits so far , @entity39 matches between offender and crime scene , which has aided more than 197,000 investigations			2
in other words , it works , and without it , @entity23 and many other rapists would remain free to commit more crimes			0
@entity23 appealed his conviction and a @entity22 court overturned it			2
@entity22 is one of 26 states that treat dna as essentially a more sophisticated and accurate version of fingerprints , collecting it after someone is arrested on certain felony charges			2
the remaining states wait until a conviction to collect @entity39			0
the @entity22 court ruled that collecting dna from arrestees was a @entity70 violation ; the state appealed that decision to the @entity16 , which ruled on monday			1
during oral arguments , justice @entity73 described this case as " perhaps the most important criminal procedure case that this court has heard in decades			0
" he 's right , and the decision will have profound positive benefits for victims of rape and their families seeking justice			1
@entity39 is the fingerprint of the 21st century , and it is long established that police can collect fingerprints upon an arrest and check to see if those prints match an unsolved case			1
take , for example , @entity89 , a 22 - year - old graduate student at @entity90			1
in august 2003 , she was raped and strangled just outside her home ; her body was burned and abandoned at a dump site			0
in 2006 , the dna gathered from under @entity89 's fingernails was matched to a man who , in the years since , had been convicted of several other crimes			1
he was convicted of her rape and murder			2
opponents of collecting dna from people arrested for felonies are right to fear a massive government database that contains intimate dna information about citizens ' genetic and health histories			0
but that 's not what @entity40 is			0
in fact , @entity40 does n't even contain an individual 's dna profile			2
it contains only 13 genetic markers , known as " junk markers , " that were specifically chosen because they are not correlated to any physical or medical traits			0
essentially , the markers used can only reveal the identity of a person and nothing else , just like fingerprinting			0
@entity34 , in the majority opinion , maintained that using dna for identification purposes is " a legitimate booking procedure " and no different than " matching tattoos to known gang symbols to reveal a criminal affiliation ; or matching the arrestee 's fingerprints to those recovered from a crime scene			1
" fears that @entity40 could be hacked , and dna profiles used for nefarious purposes , also do n't stand up to the evidence			0
first , accessing the database for non-law enforcement purposes is a serious crime , and one that has never happened			0
second , even if the database were accessed improperly , there 's nothing in it other than those 13 dna markers			2
the names of the people to whom the dna profiles belong are n't stored in the database			0
rather , once there 's a hit , law enforcement contacts the jurisdiction that uploaded that profile to find out to whom it belongs			0
it 's an extra level of protection that makes it pointless to even try to break in			0
a cheek swab , which is quicker than fingerprinting and leaves no inky residue , is less invasive than what suspects frequently experience upon arrest : frisking , handcuffing and even strip - searches			1
while in prison , suspects are observed by other inmates and uniformed officers sleeping , eating and even going to the bathroom			0
tens of thousands of criminals are in prison today thanks to @entity39 , which has proven to be a detective 's most valuable tool in our country 's fight against sexual violence			1
thanks to the decision by the @entity16 overturning the @entity22 decision , this tool remains available to law enforcement			1
they , and we , need it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity189 : @entity16 rules cops can take dna swab when there 's serious crime
at issue was a man convicted of a 6 - year - old rape after his dna was taken after an arrest
@entity189 : ruling could have stopped police from taking dna , hurting fight against rape
he says court preserved valuable tool in country 's fight against sexual violence
