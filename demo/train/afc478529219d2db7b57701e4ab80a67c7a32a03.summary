after years of rising cholesterol levels from fatty diets and pudgy waistlines , there 's finally good news , experts say			1
more people who are trying to lower their cholesterol are actually succeeding in getting their low - density lipoprotein , or bad cholesterol , down to healthy levels			1
research suggests that decreasing @entity12 -- via drugs , exercise and / or diet -- can ward off heart attacks and strokes			1
however , there 's still room for improvement , according to research from nine countries , including the @entity23 and @entity24			2
and there 's good reason to stay focused on lowering your cholesterol : research suggests that decreasing @entity12 can ward off heart attacks , strokes , and other health problems			1
in the new study , which was funded by @entity34 and published in circulation : journal of the @entity37 , an international group of researchers led by @entity39 , @entity40 , of the @entity41 , @entity42 , looked at 9,955 people with an average age of 62 to see whether cholesterol - lowering efforts -- including taking medication or trying diet and exercise alone -- were having the intended effect			1
for healthy people , the current target for ldl cholesterol is less than 160 mg / @entity52 , and for those with two or more heart disease risk factors , it 's less than 130 mg / @entity52			1
for people with heart disease , @entity12 should be less than 100 mg / @entity52 and possibly even less than 70 mg / @entity52 for those at super-high risk			1
the survey , known as the @entity61 2 , is an update of a similar survey done in the @entity23 in 1996 and 1997			0
at that time , just 38 percent of @entity23 in general and 18 percent of people with heart disease who were trying to lower cholesterol actually had their @entity12 cholesterol under control			1

waters and his colleagues found that in 2006 -- 2007 , 73 percent of people had their @entity12 cholesterol in an acceptable range			1
this included 86 percent of people at relatively low risk of heart problems , 74 percent at moderate risk , and 67 percent at high risk			2
but just one in three people , or 30 percent , who already had heart disease and at least two other risk factors ( such as obesity and smoking ) had their @entity12 cholesterol in the healthy range			1
about 75 percent of the patients in the survey were taking statins , 16 percent were treated with only diet and exercise , and the remainder took a cholesterol - lowering medication that was not a statin			1
statins include brand - name drugs like @entity99 , @entity100 , and @entity101 , among others			0
the findings " should be a wake - up call " to people who already have or are at risk of heart attack and strokes , says @entity103 , @entity40 , the codirector of the @entity104 , who was not involved with the research			2
people with cardiovascular disease should not " assume that just because they 're under medical care that they 've optimized their cardiovascular health , " he says			0
@entity67 : ultimate guide to fresh fruits and veggies however , @entity123 , @entity40 , @entity124 , of the @entity125 and the @entity126 and @entity127 in @entity128 , @entity129 , says the survey may not be a fair representation of people with high cholesterol			0
the survey included only people who had been using the same cholesterol - lowering approach for at least three months			1
" there 's lots of people in the general population who should be on these drugs who are n't on them , " @entity123 says			2
" i see a lot of patients who 've had heart attacks and strokes who are n't on these medications			0
" nevertheless , according to @entity123 , the findings are " very good news			0
" when the original survey was done , he says , there were just a couple of major clinical trials showing the health benefits of cholesterol reduction with statins			0
since then , there have been around 50 such trials , he adds , including some with women , minorities , and seniors			0
" there 's just so much more awareness now among physicians of the clinical evidence , " he says			0
@entity67 : 10 celebrity couples : who 's healthy , who 's not ? @entity103 says there are still plenty of doctors out there who do n't treat cholesterol as aggressively as they should			2
" the threat to the patient is something that plays out over many years or decades ; it 's not an immediate threat , " he notes			0
this time lag can make it difficult for some people to see the benefits of treating high cholesterol just as aggressively as they would a heart attack , says @entity103			2
@entity123 says he measures his patients ' heart disease and stroke risk by giving them a 12 - hour fasting cholesterol test and a scan of the walls of the arteries in their neck			1
if the scan shows fatty plaques , he recommends cholesterol - lowering therapy even if the patient 's cholesterol levels are normal			1
@entity67 : new @entity202 apps for healthier , more earth - friendly shopping other steps people can take , aside from seeing their doctor , include quitting smoking and exercising more , @entity123 says			0
there 's even a home cholesterol test -- just like the home glucose tests used by people with diabetes -- that patients could use			1
" people can be very proactive , " he explains			0

why are more people hitting cholesterol targets ? it probably is n't because more patients are taking their medication properly or sticking with their diet , according to an editorial published with the study			2
it 's more likely that the newer cholesterol - lowering drugs do a better job of curbing @entity12 , writes @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity40 , @entity124 , of @entity234 , in @entity235			1
about half of the study participants were taking one of these newer drugs , he notes			2
