-- let me explain to you why it 's important that i have a .50 - caliber machine gun capable of firing 500 rounds per minute bolted to the top of my corolla			1
you do know that this is a dangerous city , right ? a guy i know got mugged last month			1
not only that , it 's entirely possible that while going around the @entity15 , a commando team of @entity14 fighters could come up behind me on their way to murder the president , and the only thing standing between them and disaster will be me			2
not to mention that this one time , after i cut a guy off because he was in my blind spot , he gave me a really dirty look			0
if had had my .50 - cal , you can bet he would have stayed a good distance back			0
if you consider this reasoning rational , then you were probably also persuaded by the testimony @entity29 of the @entity30 gave wednesday to a @entity32 committee discussing potential legislation to place some relatively modest limits on guns			1
opinion : why the @entity37 fights for gun rights @entity29 argued that women need to have the biggest , baddest weapons they can get their hands on			1
why ? for " the peace of mind that a woman has as she 's facing three , four , five violent attackers , intruders in her home , with her children screaming in the background , the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary - looking gun gives her more courage when she 's fighting hardened , violent criminals			1
if we ban these types of assault weapons , you are putting women at a great disadvantage			1
" so we ca n't limit the most dangerous weapons , because somewhere there might be a woman who needs one to fight the five violent attackers who have invaded her home			1
and we ca n't limit the rounds a magazine can hold , because what if that frightened housewife needs to engage in an hourlong firefight ? you do n't expect her to reload , do you ? your average gun owner may think that 's crazy , but it 's the world some extreme gun advocates -- including those with great influence in @entity78 -- inhabit , where laws should be written not with the reality of @entity83 ' lives and deaths in mind , but according to the most horrible fantasies anyone can conjure			2
now , let 's talk about some reality			2
the sad fact is that what women most have to fear is abusive partners , not home invaders			1
according to one analysis of @entity98 data from 2010 , 94 % of female homicide victims knew their killers , and most of those killers were husbands or boyfriends			0
and as you 've probably heard , a gun in your home is many times more likely to be used to kill one of the people in that home , be used in a suicide , or result in an accidental death than it is to be wielded against an intruder			1
what gun advocates say is that we all need to put ourselves and our families in danger to prepare for the home invasion that is the equivalent of being struck by lightning			1
according to the @entity98 , in the entire country in 2011 there were just 201 justifiable homicides committed with guns by private citizens			2
there are over 300 million guns in @entity83 , which means that about 1 out of every 1.5 million guns was actually used for lethal self - defense			2
according to the @entity135 , your chance of being hit by lightning this year is a mere 1 in 1 million			0
opinion : @entity83 , even @entity37 members , want gun controls nevertheless , people still have the right to own as many guns as they want			2
what we 're debating is which kind of guns they can get and what procedures they 'll have to follow to get them			0
perhaps @entity29 believes that having a few handguns and rifles just is n't enough to protect herself ; she needs the kind of weaponry that @entity151 carries if she 's going to feel secure in her home			1
that could be what @entity154 thought as she amassed the arsenal her son @entity157 would use to commit his horrific crime in @entity154			0
that may seem like an inflammatory comparison -- after all , what are the odds that someone in your family is going to go crazy and kill a bunch of people ? perhaps lower than the odds of a heavily armed band of escaped convicts invading your home			0
let 's have one final dose of reality , the story of @entity177			1
a 15 - year - old honors student from @entity180 , she recenlty performed with her school 's band at president @entity184 's inauguration			0
four years ago , as an elementary school student , she appeared in a public service video imploring kids to stay away from gangs and violence			0
this tuesday , she was in a park with friends when someone came up and started shooting			0
she was shot in the back and died at a local hospital			0
@entity177 's tragic death was n't someone 's paranoid fantasy , and it was n't lighting striking			1
it was one of the many real faces of gun violence in @entity83 today			0
she had the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time , but it was a tragically common place to be			0
just since the @entity154 massacre , 1,463 @entity83 have been killed with guns			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : ok if i drive around with a machine gun on my roof ? i live in dangerous city
he says @entity29 gun testimony about needing assault weapons is just as irrational
he says women face gun death from abusive partners . home invasion rare as lightning strike
@entity210 : @entity177 's shooting shows we need fewer guns , not more assault weapons
