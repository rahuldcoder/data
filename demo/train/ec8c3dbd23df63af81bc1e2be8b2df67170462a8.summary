-- the @entity1 has pointed to a lack of " compelling evidence " to support match - fixing claims relating to a one - day match between @entity6 and @entity7 in september			1
@entity10 newspaper @entity8 claimed it had proof that bookmakers knew details of scoring patterns in @entity7 's innings before the match at @entity17 in @entity18 began			1
that allegation prompted the chairman of the @entity21 , @entity20 , to claim there was talk in bookmakers circles that @entity6 's players had been paid " enormous amounts of money " to lose the match			2
@entity20 later withdrew his comments after the @entity6 team threatened to take legal action against him			0
now the @entity1 's anti-corruption and security unit ( @entity34 ) has dropped its investigation into the match , saying there is n't strong enough evidence			1
a statement on the @entity1 's official website read : " the @entity34 has verified all the available information and concluded that there was no compelling evidence to suspect individual players or support staff			1
" the investigation is now complete but if new and corroborating evidence comes to light then clearly the @entity34 will re-open the matter			0
" the @entity1 said they would not comment on the case featuring three @entity7 players -- @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 -- who are currently suspended after claims of spot - fixing during the @entity59 series with @entity6 , but they did maintain their determination to clean up the game			1
@entity1 president @entity63 said : " we have stressed that we will not tolerate any form of corruption in cricket and that we will work tirelessly to root out those who have acted in a way which brings cricket into disrepute			0
" the future of our great sport depends on the public maintaining their confidence in the games they are watching			0
we owe it to every player , administrator , every cricket lover to win this battle against a very small minority who may wish to corrupt this game			0
" the @entity1 also said its @entity84 will work with the @entity21 to " carry out any reforms which may be deemed necessary to restore confidence in the administration of the game in @entity7			2
" the @entity1 also confirmed their intention to pave the way for a world test championship starting in 2013			1
it would mean a playoff between the top four ranked @entity59 teams every four years			0
" we have agreed in principle to exciting and far - reaching proposals to tackle this most important issue , " said @entity1 chief executive @entity95			2
" the proposals , especially introducing more meaningful context , means we now have the potential to follow international cricket that is even more exciting			0
