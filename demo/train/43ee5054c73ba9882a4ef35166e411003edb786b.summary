@entity0 -- tourists and businesses are already feeling the sting of federal budget cuts , with officials in @entity7 announcing delays for opening parts of @entity10			1
the @entity11 is taking a $ 113 million hit under the so - called government sequester that took effect on friday and is set to run through the end of the current fiscal year unless @entity17 calls it off or changes how it is implemented later this month			1
the impact on the overall federal budget and deficit reduction is miniscule , but the meaning of cuts to local businesses in and around treasured landmarks that host nearly 300 million visitors a year is all too real			1
@entity30 @entity29 campaign arm goes online in the blame game over forced spending cuts the @entity33 and the @entity34 will be affected , according to @entity35 , budget and appropriations legislative representative for the @entity39			1
the @entity33 stands to lose $ 1.6 million and the @entity34 almost $ 780,000 between now and the end of the fiscal year in september			2
local government officials and business leaders in @entity43 , @entity7 , said @entity10 will delay the opening of its north and west entrances by a week until april 26 , and its east , south and northeast entrances by two weeks until mid-to - late may because of the impact of budget cuts on snow removal			1
the delay will cost related businesses several million dollars , the local @entity51 said			0
@entity54 , marketing director for the @entity10 , @entity55 , @entity51 said the park and its visitors are the lifeblood of her community			2
" limiting access to the park even for a few weeks can have significant impacts on the bottom line of a small business reliant on those visitors , " @entity54 said			0
" these visitors contribute tax dollars and support jobs			0
" so what are these cuts actually worth ? the @entity11 operates on $ 2.2 billion annually , or a tiny fraction of the federal budget			2
but its sites pump $ 31 billion into local economies and visitation has been up despite a sluggish economy			0
opinion : @entity77 sick of budget soap opera national parks contribute more than 270,000 jobs outside the @entity11 like lodging , food and beverage services , and recreation and entertainment			1
" it is important to note that proposed cuts to @entity10 and @entity89 national park budgets will save the federal government $ 2.5 million , but in all likelihood tax losses due to reduced tourism could offset the savings			1
last year , nonresident tourism to @entity55 generated approximately $ 253 million in federal taxes , " @entity54 said			2
according to @entity98 , eight of the top 25 @entity77 tourist destinations are national parks			1
in a memo , the @entity11 outlined some of the more specific changes and closures that would be attributed to the proposed spending cuts			1
for instance , @entity105 , which honors the famous @entity107 battle , would eliminate 20 % of its spring student education programs , affecting 2,400 students			0
@entity111 will reduce hours of operation at the main visitor center , affecting at least 250,000 people			2
the @entity30 said , " many of the 398 national parks across the country would be partially or fully closed " during the six months of budget austerity and other parks would experience shorter hours , fewer employees and limited camping and hiking spaces			1
it will take a month or so for the cuts to kick in at most federal agencies			0
share your story : how do you feel about the cuts ? in the 2011 fiscal year , funding for the @entity11 was cut by almost $ 140 million			1
from 2002 to 2011 , the budget fell by 13 % overall			0
according to @entity35 , recent cuts have taken a toll , with deferred maintenance requests running into the billions of dollars			0
in the long term , @entity35 fears further cuts could have a detrimental effect on the vitality of national parks , including limited resources for " curbing invasive species and long term protection ( of park areas )			1
" areas managed directly by the @entity11 wo n't be the only ones to experience the pain of spending restrictions			0
the @entity147 in @entity10 will feel it , too			2
" because of the seasonality of our business and the fact that our town of @entity10 basically shuts down whenever @entity10 closes , we need revenue generated every day in order to stay solvent on a year - round basis , " owner @entity148 said			2
" opening our businesses for shorter time periods or causing reductions in visitation during the shoulder seasons of the park will cause proportionate reductions in the overall economy			2
" @entity165 : cuts a damning indictment of @entity0 almost 279 million people visit national parks each year			1
visitor concessions like souvenir shops , lodging , transportation , equipment rental and food services will suffer from the decrease in tourism caused by the limitation in park hours			0
" there is a breaking point and once we reach that and services begin to suffer , this will be directly reflected in the experience our visitors are having and that poses the greatest danger -- when we can no longer deliver on the promised experience , " @entity54 said			0
but economist @entity188 from the @entity189 said cuts in cases like this are n't that significant			0
" i think almost any organization can sustain a 5 % cut in their budget and not have it interfere with their basic mission , " she said			0
" the budgeting process is completely broken			0
it 's @entity17 ' job to figure out where investments should be made and where agencies should be cut , it 's a mindless process and it 's not meant to become policy			0
beyond spending cuts : what 's next for @entity0			1

forced spending cuts to trim $ 113 million from park service budget
new : parts of @entity10 will open later due to impact of cuts on snow removal
@entity218 could see shorter hours , fewer employees and limited camping and hiking spaces
almost 279 million people visit national parks each year
