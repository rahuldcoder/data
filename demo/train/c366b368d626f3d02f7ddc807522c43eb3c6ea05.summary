@entity0 , @entity1 -- if @entity4 never realizes her dream of swimming the @entity7 straits , it wo n't be for lack of trying			1
the 64 - year - old began her fifth and last bid to swim from @entity1 to the @entity12 on saturday morning			1
previous attempts were thwarted by dehydration , ocean currents and excruciating jellyfish stings to her tongue			2
" there 's the fine line between seeing that things are bigger than you and letting your ego go , " @entity4 said at a news conference in @entity0 friday			1
" and there 's another edge over that fine line where you do n't ever want to give up and i am still at that place ! " were @entity4 to swim the 103 miles from @entity0 to the @entity32 , she would be the first person to do so without the benefits of a shark cage , flippers or wet suit			1
and it would validate her attempts , which have spanned 35 years			1
in 1997 , @entity40 endurance swimmer @entity39 , then 22 , completed the swim from within a shark cage			1
along with the protection the cage offers against toothy predators , swimmers say the cage provides a barrier against waves and other weather hazards			2
since @entity39 's swim , some of the world 's best endurance swimmers have tried to cross the straits of @entity7 without using a cage			1
all have been turned back			0
but few have done so as persistently or as colorfully as @entity4			0
the @entity59 , @entity7 , resident says she feels a special bond with @entity1 and hopes her repeated efforts to swim between the two countries will help improve the still - tense relations between @entity0 and @entity64			1
@entity4 often tried to communicate in rudimentary @entity65 during the news conference friday			0
she has said that during her long swims , she sings the @entity1 ballad , " @entity69 , " to herself hundreds of times			1
@entity1 authorities said that after her latest attempt was announced in state media , they received a barrage of suggestions from across the island on how she could ward off the stinging jellyfish that ended previous attempts			2
this time , @entity4 said , she will wear surgical gloves and a specially designed prosthetic face mask to prevent the jellyfish from stinging her			0
" it took us a year , we made mold after mold , " @entity4 said of the mask , adding it was the kind used to protect people who had suffered injuries to their faces			0
" it 's a two - edged sword for me			2
it 's cumbersome , it 's difficult to swim with , but it does n't matter			2
there 's no other way			0
" @entity4 will be accompanied by a 35 - member crew aboard two sail boats			0
they will monitor her health , update her progress on social media and try to ward off sharks that might view her as a potential snack			0
if all goes to plan , @entity4 said , the swim will take her three days to finish			0
