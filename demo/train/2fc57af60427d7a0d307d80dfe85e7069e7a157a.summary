-- ever heard of a @entity1 ? how about a @entity2 ? no ? that 's not surprising			2
these two tiger sub-species went extinct decades ago thanks to massive habitat loss and poaching			2
the question is whether their cousins the @entity11 tigers , will soon join them			1
the odds are not in their favor			0
as recently as 1978 more than 1,000 @entity11 tigers lived on @entity16			1
but thanks to appallingly high deforestation and rampant poaching their numbers have dropped to around 400			1
the once - lush green island has lost more than half its forest cover since 1985			0
according to @entity27 , the wildlife trade monitoring arm of @entity25 and @entity26 , poachers kill at least 40 @entity11 tigers per year , and the killing is made that much easier as their habitat shrinks			1
this also brings them into conflict with people , which often results in retaliatory killings when they attack livestock or villagers			0
it 's not hard to poach a tiger			2
a length of metal cable , a few strong branches and a little expertise in setting a snare can bag one pretty quickly			0
as @entity45 demonstrates in the groundbreaking @entity0 series expedition : @entity16 , these snares are simple but stunningly effective tiger killers			1
and there just are n't enough anti-poaching patrols to find all of the snares and the people who set them			2

using camera traps , scat surveys and other scientific tools @entity25 and its partners are able to estimate the population size and distribution of tigers across @entity16			1
the camera traps are an especially valuable tool , allowing researchers to gather more precise data on individual tigers using their stripe patterns			2
just like humans and fingerprints , no two tiger stripe patterns are the same			0
understanding tiger distribution allows scientists and forestry officials to designate protected areas and wildlife corridors that allow tigers to breed and disperse , and also to understand where best to patrol against poaching			1
@entity25 's @entity83 patrol vulnerable areas , gather vital intelligence about poachers and remove poachers ' snares			1
in places where they operate , poaching has dramatically declined			2
@entity83 also work with communities to help them better understand tigers and develop solutions to human - tiger conflict			1
the longer - term solution is more complicated but just as critical			0
it all comes down to zoning and land use planning that benefits critical wildlife habitat and the needs of indigenous groups such as the @entity102 and @entity103			0
it 's tough to make the case for protecting tiger forests when faced with stiff competition from the highly profitable pulp , paper and palm oil industries			0
but one innovative solution may help make the case			0
read more : the devastation of @entity114 's forests in @entity114 , most forest areas are owned by the government and leased out for commercial activities in long - term concessions			1
by rezoning critical tiger habitat currently slated for deforestation , mining or agriculture into ecosystem restoration concessions , the @entity114 government can protect wildlife , support local communities and ensure that the forests are managed sustainably			0
one such joint venture is currently under consideration in the buffer zone outside @entity16 's @entity131 , also known as @entity131			1
as documented on @entity132 : @entity16 , this is an ambitious and forward thinking venture that could be the best last hope for the tigers of @entity131			1
to find out how you can help , go to @entity137 and add your name to a petition urging @entity114 to re-zone the areas around @entity131 for conservation concessions			0
if given enough habitat , plenty of prey and protection from poaching , tigers are breeding machines			2
their populations can rebound from even the low numbers currently seen in @entity11 tigers			1
the weak link in all of this is humans			0
we can be their worst enemy or their best friend			0
by rallying the political will to protect their habitat and stopping the relentless onslaught of poaching , we can be part of the solution and ensure that future generations will share a planet with these noble creatures .			0
