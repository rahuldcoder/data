-- thanks to @entity7 printers , dentists can today print false teeth and medical device manufacturers can print hip replacements			1
such creations are useful , but not exactly sexy			2
thankfully , artists are demonstrating another dimension of the technology , printing remarkable creations that would n't have been possible even a decade ago			1
the @entity16 artist wanted to meld the architecture of @entity18 with representations of his own body			2
approximating the shape and dimensions of your own heart is a challenge , but @entity14 did not have to guess			2
he underwent a series of mri scans , and then , with a few clicks of the mouse , was able to view his own heart in 3 - @entity31 he then merged that with a representation of the dome of @entity18 's and sent the design to a @entity7 printer , which deposited material layer by layer to create a solid object			1
the result was ' @entity40 , ' a twisting , mind - boggling sculpture that links man - made architecture with the architecture of a man			1
" it allows me to move into more eccentric areas , " @entity14 says			0
" we see a super beautiful influx of people working with the medium			0
we 're just seeing how far this can go			0
" new possibilities according to @entity56 , a manufacturing research firm , the market for 3 - d printing topped $ 2 billion in 2012 , up nearly 30 % from the year before			1
and while most of the cash comes from manufacturing companies , artists are throwing ever more dollars at 3 - d printers and related technologies			1
the desire to innovate is driving the trend , as are falling prices and the increased availability of 3 - d printers			1
@entity69 organized " 3d : @entity71 " , an exhibition running at @entity74 's @entity73 until june 15			0
" although 3 - d printing as a technology is n't that new , there has been an explosion of creativity around it in recent years , " she says			1
" it gives artists more design freedom and enables them to create amazing things			2
" @entity87 , one of the artists featured in the exhibition , takes children 's drawings and , using computer aided software , blows the images up like balloons			2
a 3 - d printer then produces these so - called ' crayon creatures , ' turning scribbles into mini sculptures			1
@entity100 , an artist and former puppet maker , focuses on designs that can only be made using 3d printing			2
her white horse marionette includes an elaborate set of wings made of countless interlocking parts , all printed in one go			0
that means there is no assembly required and the piece is ready for sale immediately			0
" there is absolutely no way you can make this design using traditional manufacturing or handcraft methods , " she says			0
@entity122 has benefited as well			0
for the @entity124 in september , the lingerie giant wanted model @entity125 to have spectacular wings that captured the intricacy of snowflakes			1
designer @entity130 relied on a @entity7 printing process called @entity132 that can fabricate complex interlocking support without additional support materials			1
@entity7 printing also ensured a snug fit			1
" we actually scanned the model and then wrote code that generated the snowflakes around the @entity7 mesh of @entity125 's body			1
" financial incentive for artists who live outside of the world 's major art markets , 3 - d printing helps them access customers further afield			1
@entity150 , who is based in @entity151 , says it can be costly to reach new markets and to travel to meet potential clients			0
" 3 - d printing removes many of these barriers and has the potential to level the playing field , " she says			1
" my designs can be printed at a location close to the buyer and many online repositories exist where buyers can choose products			0
" museums see commercial promise in new printing techniques as well			2
@entity169 's @entity168 , which holds the world 's largest collection of paintings by the @entity174 artist , has teamed up with @entity175 to create @entity7 replicas of five @entity177 , including the iconic " sunflowers " and " @entity179			1
" @entity175 scanned the works and then printed 260 replicas of each — a process that takes three months			2
known as " @entity185 " , the copies capture not only the colors — there are 32 shades of yellow in " sunflowers " — but also the particulars of @entity193 's brushstrokes , including height and direction			0
they also include the frame and the backside of each painting , which have stickers and other markers of where the paintings have traveled			2
" this way people can see the history of the painting , " says @entity204 , the head of public affairs at the museum			0
" a painting travels around the world			0
people can see it was in exhibitions at the @entity215 and other museums			0
" the @entity185 sell for € 25,000 each , about $ 34,000 , and will help the museum pay for essential renovations			0
previous sales in @entity220 and @entity221 were a huge success , so the museum has launched similar sales in @entity225 and the @entity174			0
it will take its works to @entity228 in the new year			0
baby steps critics of @entity7 art reproductions like to point how much they vary from the original			1
but @entity233 , a professor of materials science at @entity236 's @entity235 , believes it is more interesting to compare @entity7 reproductions to earlier 2 - @entity240 reproductions			1
it shows how far technology has come			2
working with @entity243 and the @entity244 , @entity233 and one of his graduate students developed a scanning technique that allows them to capture the ridges and cracks of a painting , and to see beyond the surface layer of paint to understand the structure of the painting			0
to the untrained eye their reproduction of @entity259 's " @entity258 " might be mistaken for the original			0
but for @entity233 that 's not the point			0
what 's important is that his @entity7 representation is an incremental step forward			1
in the @entity268 scanning techniques and printing may even replicate layers and luminescence , the quality whereby particles in paint make it appear to shine			2
" the one thing that is certain is that 3 - d printing is advancing rapidly , " @entity275 says			1
" i 'm quite sure that in a couple of years we 'll be a couple of steps further			0

@entity7 printing is opening new *avenues* for artists
the @entity168 is printing 3 - d replicas of iconic paintings
even @entity124 has embraced the technology
