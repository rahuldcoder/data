you 've seen the headlines this week : " huge ice storm hits the @entity3			2
" " disastrous snow storm heads toward @entity5			2
" if you live southeast of the @entity9 , weather bulletins about ice and snow have been almost impossible to avoid the past few days			1
but as scary as they sound , few realize it could be a whole lot more deadly			2
even though the storms of february are not over , it is safe to say that their ultimate cost will be in the tens of billions of dollars and may further dampen what some economists believe is an already weak recovery			2
production grinds to a halt in areas where there is no electricity			2
goods can not be transported over blizzard - closed highways			0
plus , there is the human toll : people shivering in homes without power for days and lost wages because of factories shutting down when parts ca n't reach the assembly line			0
but here 's an unexpected thought : without weather science , all of this would be much worse			1
live blog : deadly weather we only have to go back two weeks to get a glimpse of what life would be like without weather forecasts and storm warnings			1
@entity50 and @entity51 officials chose to ignore accurate warnings of 1 to 3 inches of snow , resulting in utter gridlock and 22 - hour one - way commutes			0
with that wake - up call , people took the forecasts seriously this time			2
schedules were adjusted and people worked from home			0
for days , meteorologists warned of widespread power failures			0
as of wednesday afternoon , the number of people without power in the @entity67 -- the number of households without power multiplied by 3.5 people per household -- was more than 1 million and rising rapidly			0
it appears that most people in affected areas where power has been lost heeded the warnings so as to mitigate the effects			0
track winter weather in the @entity3 and all that is because our nation 's complex weather infrastructure -- state - of - the - art technology , satellites in the sky , powerful computers on the ground and talented , committed professionals in the public and private sector -- is making it easier and faster for you to know when the big one is coming , saving money and saving lives			1
as i explained in my book , " warnings : the @entity105 , " @entity99 's life - saving storm warning system was created by dedicated scientists fighting storms and bureaucracy to provide the accurate warnings we enjoy today			0
over the years , a beneficial division of duties has evolved : the taxpayer - funded @entity108 provides the meteorological infrastructure needed by everyone as well as forecasts and storm warnings for the public - at - large			1
@entity115 , ice pummel @entity67 , stranding drivers , cutting power private - sector weather organizations such as @entity119 and @entity120 draw on this infrastructure to provide specifically tailored forecasts and storm warnings needed by television audiences , businesses and other specialized clientele			1
this system works extraordinarily well			0
@entity99 's @entity130 -- the sum of the @entity108 , related federal agencies , commercial weather companies and local meteorologists -- are all striving to build a weather - ready nation			1
and there is plenty of work yet to be done : -- more and better measurements of the state of the atmosphere			0
-- better computer models that can use those measurements to create more accurate forecast guidance			0
-- accurate , timely forecasts for the public			1
-- specialized services for businesses , government agencies and others to suit their specific requirements			0
-- educating the public and specialized users about the ways to use weather information most effectively to protect people and property			1
unfortunately , there are those who propose putting the safety of the public in jeopardy by changing the emphasis of the @entity108 to an organization primarily dedicated to giving " decision - support services			1
" this means that instead of a successful , vital agency providing and maintaining the weather infrastructure to make sure we know when the next storm is coming -- all based on real data -- they would be turned into governmental " consultants " with the duty to help bureaucrats and others make decisions			1
for instance , as the current ice storm was developing , a forecaster at the @entity178 office wrote monday in an " area forecast discussion " that he did n't have sufficient time for forecasting the ice storm because he was spending most of his time on " decision support			2
" whether it is a hurricane , ice storm , blizzard or tornado looming , what does that taxpayer prefer ? an accurate storm warning for everyone , or the @entity108 forecasters distracted by giving weather briefings to specialized groups , something that may not be part of their core expertise ? by keeping the current division of duties , the @entity201 can boost the @entity99 economy -- and provide much - needed jobs -- while saving the government money			1
it is a win - win for everyone .			0

@entity210 says that advances in weather science have made forecasting much better
a robust weather infrastructure and public / private *partnerships* have improved forecasts
but , @entity210 argues , proposed changes in the @entity108 could impact safety
