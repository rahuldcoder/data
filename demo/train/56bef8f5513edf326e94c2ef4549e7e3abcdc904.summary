-- a man convicted of a brutal 2007 home invasion in which a @entity4 mother and her two daughters were killed was sentenced to die for the crime thursday			1
@entity8 superior court judge @entity7 imposed the death sentence agreed upon last month by jurors			1
jurors in october convicted @entity12 , 47 , of 16 of the 17 charges against him , including murder , capital murder and kidnapping			1
@entity12 , 48 , died as a result of the home invasion , along with her daughters , 17 - year - old @entity12 and 11 - year - old @entity12			1
" this is a terrible sentence , " @entity7 told @entity12			1
" but in truth , it is a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames on july 23 , 2007			2
" prosecutors alleged that @entity12 and co-defendant @entity12 invaded the @entity29 home in @entity30 , @entity4 , beat and tied up dr. @entity12 , raped and strangled @entity32 , molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee			1
the two daughters , who had been tied to their beds , died of smoke inhalation			2
@entity32 escaped to a neighbor 's home			1
@entity12 also forced @entity32 to go to a bank and withdraw $ 15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 , authorities said			1
@entity47 is to be tried separately later			2
at least four jurors were in the courtroom for the sentencing			2
before it was pronounced , the court heard emotional impact statements from relatives of the three victims including @entity12 as photos of the family were projected onto a screen			1
in his remarks , which brought many in the courtroom to tears , @entity32 said the impact of the crime on his family was akin to " a bomb going off in your house			1
" he said he would always remember his father 's face when he asked him about the girls			2
" he just shook his head from side to side and sobbed ... our home was no more			1
" @entity12 told the court in his statement that death " will be a welcome relief			1
" " i am deeply sorry for what i 've done , " he said			2
" ... i stand before the court as @entity12 , convicted murderer , but that is not the real @entity12			1
" he acknowledged he " destroyed innocent lives and took away a family			2
i did what i did , and live with it ... i was an out - of - control train destined to crash			2
the death i wanted was my own , not the death of others			1
" @entity12 was also seen looking at the photographs of the family			1
" i think he knows the devastation that he caused , " defense attorney @entity99 told reporters afterward			2
@entity99 earlier had told jurors that in recommending @entity12 die for his crimes , they would be providing him with what he wanted , saying life in prison without parole would be a greater punishment			1
@entity99 said thursday he thought it was a " barbaric sentence			2
" " in my lifetime , i hope i never stand next to another person getting sentenced to death , " he said			1
@entity114 gave @entity12 an official execution date of may 27 , 2011			1
however , that date is a formality , he acknowledged			2
in reality , unless @entity12 chooses to waive some or all of his appeals , it could be decades before he is put to death			1
@entity32 wiped his eyes , cried and embraced family members after the sentence was handed down			0
he and other family members did not speak to reporters outside the courthouse , saying they wanted their words inside the courtroom to be their statement			1
@entity32 told the court that following the crime , he lost all interest in practicing medicine			0
at first , he was unable to sleep ; given medication to relieve his insomnia , he had nightmares , he said			0
his vision was impaired by the blows to the head he suffered , which also caused balance and vertigo problems			0
" i seriously considered suicide many times , " he said			0
" no wife , no children , no home			2
" he called his wife " the spiritual anchor of our family " and " my best friend , " adding that she taught him about prayer			0
he said when he saw the video of his wife at the bank for the first time , " i saw the strain on her face ... but i suspect she was praying			0
" he also spoke about his daughters , recalling how pleased he was when @entity162 told him she wanted to major in biology so that she , too , could go into medicine			2
" i grieve , " he said , " because she never got to love somebody for a long time			0
" after that sentence , he paused for several minutes to compose himself , then went on to note that his elder daughter was a " hard worker , honest and very brave			0
" she raised $ 55,000 for multiple sclerosis research after @entity12 was diagnosed with the disease , he said			1
@entity32 remembered @entity173 , or " @entity174 " as her family called her , as a gifted cook who loved to help him in the garden			0
" i miss my entire family , everything we had together , " he said			0
" ... they were three special people			0
my children were my jewels			0
" he said he will never get to walk his daughters down the aisle , or meet his grandchildren			0
now , he said , he is left to deal with " a giant hole in the universe , in my heart			0
" " i lost my entire family , " he said			0
" ... i lost my past and my future			0
" his only hope , he said , is for justice to be served			0
" @entity193 does exist , and it can strike at any time ... @entity193 is among us , and we need to rid the world of it			0
" earlier , @entity12 's younger sister , in an impact statement recorded on @entity199 , said , " you felt it was your right in life to take what others had			1
" @entity205 recalled looking to her sister for guidance and advice			0
" you stole from all of us , " she told @entity12			1
" you interrupted our cycle of life			0
" the girls ' grandfather , @entity12 , recalled his anguish at learning of the deaths , choking back tears as he spoke of trying to call his son 's home on the morning of july 23 and hearing @entity32 's voice on the answering machine			1
it was , he said , " the last time i heard her voice			0
" if @entity12 is executed he will die peacefully , without difficulty breathing , anxiety or pain , @entity205 said , according to a copy of her statement posted on the @entity232 newspaper 's website			1
" i would have given anything for my loved ones to have died in this same peaceful manner , " she said			0
" @entity12 has no empathy , " said @entity236 , @entity12 's sister			1
" ... he has no remorse ; the only thing he 's sorry about is that he got caught			0
" the murders were so heinous , she said , that " the state of @entity4 was aghast			0
" " some people are so evil that they do not deserve life , " she said , " and @entity12 falls into that category			1
" the deaths shocked the affluent @entity4 suburb of @entity30 , where @entity32 is a prominent endocrinologist			0
his wife was a pediatric nurse who did not let multiple sclerosis keep her from working or raising a family			0
@entity12 had just graduated from @entity252 , a prestigious private school that counts @entity253 and @entity254 among its alumnae			1
the deaths also led to a public outcry for @entity4 to strengthen its laws against repeat offenders when it was learned that the suspects had previously been convicted of multiple felonies			0
citing the @entity30 case , gov. @entity263 vetoed a resolution that would have eliminated the death penalty in the state .			2
