the @entity1 will soon add @entity3 's killer whale , @entity4 , to the endangered species list , but nothing will change for the longtime @entity8 entertainer			1
at 49 , the senior whale will be added to the endangered listing for the @entity11 found in the waters off @entity13 , where @entity4 was captured in 1970			1
the @entity15 population was depleted between 1965 and 1975 because of captures conducted for marine parks , according to @entity18			0
the population 's numbers remain low due to such environmental factors as pollution , oil spills and noise from passing vessels , @entity1 says			0
as a result , the @entity15 killer whales were added to the endangered species 10 years ago			0
animal activists , @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity31 see this ruling as a victory			2
" it 's @entity4 's chance of freedom , " said @entity35 , @entity29 's director of animal law			2
" it 's a huge step			0
" activists petitioned @entity1 to include @entity4 to the @entity15 endangered list , saying they never had the right to separate her from designation for the @entity13 killer whale population			1
about 17,000 comments were submitted to the federal agency in support of the endangered designation for @entity4			2
animal rights activists want @entity4 eventually released back into the wild if she can be rehabilitated to survive on her own after 40 years of captivity where she is hand - fed instead of capturing her own food			1
websites such as @entity54 ( savelolita.org ) and protests like one in @entity8 where hundreds marched for the release of @entity4			0
activists say they have a plan to move @entity4 from @entity8 to a privately owned cove at @entity62 in @entity63			2
there , @entity4 could be rehabilitated from captivity and taught to forage for her own food , says @entity35			0
the activists admit @entity4 might never survive a release in the open ocean for a number of reasons			2
@entity74 , from the movie " @entity73 , " died only three years after being returned to the ocean			0
@entity3 says @entity4 's is not going anywhere			1
" @entity4 has been part of the @entity3 family for 44 years , " says @entity76 , @entity3 curator			1
" @entity4 is healthy and thriving in her home , where she shares her habitat with @entity83 white - sided dolphins , " who perform two shows daily says the curator			0
@entity86 and @entity1 say the endangered designation does not required the killer whale to be released back into the wild			1
plus any such movement of a killer whale would need a @entity93 permit and extensive review			1
" we are going to do everything to protect her ( @entity4 ) , " said the @entity29 attorney			0
that would include suing anyone who harms the endangered killer whale			1
what constitutes harm could ultimately be decided by a federal judge			0
@entity3 is one of the oldest marine parks in the @entity107 , and activists say @entity4 's habitat is not big enough			1
they are suing the federal government for not enforcing the minimum size requirement			0
but the @entity112 tells the @entity3 that the park exceeds minimum size requirements for the pool			0
@entity29 says even if @entity4 ca n't be rehabilitated to return to the wild , the @entity63 cove is much larger and her former killer whale pods will swim by her open water habitat			1
the @entity3 curator says there 's no proof @entity4 could survive in such a habitat			1
" it would be reckless to treat her life as an experiment and jeopardize her health and safety			0
" opinion : can a killer whale be a slave ?			2

@entity4 is 49 and has been with the @entity3 , which says it *intends* to keep her there
animal rights activists still see the decision as a victory and hope to have the killer whale released
