-- i recently came across @entity3 's book " @entity4 : how @entity5 went from @entity6 to @entity7			1
" i have to admit that i did n't know if a hip - hop icon had much to teach me ( aka a regular worker ) about succeeding in our respective fields			2
but seeing as career books often begin to sound alike when you read the summaries on the flap , i could n't pass up this interesting angle			2
plus , he 's just a good artist			1
i did n't doubt @entity5 was a prime example of success			1
his picture might as well be next to the @entity22 entry on " living the dream			2
" whether or not you 're a fan of his music -- and between " @entity4 " and " @entity26 , " you have to like at least one of his tracks -- you ca n't deny that the man has been able to achieve and exceed his goals			1
@entity5 ( née @entity5 ) has countless hits , co-founded @entity34 clothing , co-owns a basketball team , and was an executive of two different record labels			1
oh , and @entity38 picked his 2010 autobiography to be one of her favorite things , which is about as coveted an endorsement as you can hope for			2
but after reading @entity3 's book , i have to admit i understand why he makes a superb guide for your career , even if you are looking to be an investment banker or grocery store manager instead of a hip hop legend			1
if you look at what @entity5 has done with his career , you might realize that what made him successful is what makes many great leaders successful			1
below are five lessons that i think we can all learn from @entity5 's career : 1			1
find something your passionate about and make it part of your life what @entity5 did : @entity5 is a sports enthusiast			1
he 's a proud @entity66 fan and he 's been a courtside fixture at @entity69 games for years for @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
not content with just being a fan , @entity5 assembled a team ( that included @entity76 ) in 2003 to play in @entity77 ( @entity77 ) and then became a co-owner of the @entity79			1
what you can do : many of us are sports fans , but few of us have the bank account and business savvy to own an @entity69 team			2
however , we can find a way to make one of our passions part of our everyday life , even if your interest does n't fit within your current job			1
for example , if you are obsessed with politics but you work at a clothing store , you should leave your opinion of @entity98 at home			2
but that does n't mean you ca n't start your own political blog or become a contributor to another one			2
that way you can immerse yourself in a subject you love and still improve your analytical and writing skills			2
you never know what will become of your side venture -- maybe a new business opportunity			2
maybe nothing will happen beyond gaining readership , but at least you 'll have space where you can indulge your passions			1
market yourself what @entity5 did : one of the other reasons @entity5 decided to assemble that basketball team in the @entity77 ? he knew it was great marketing			1
he branded a bus with the image of a sneaker he designed for @entity123 , had the team tour in it , all while his music blared			1
and then they 'd celebrate at the club he owned in @entity129			2
it was his project from top to bottom and he was n't afraid to promote it			2
what you can do : the odds are slim that somebody will walk up to you and say , " wow , all that great work you do ? unbelievable ! let me offer you this high - paying job that is perfect for you			0
" instead , make sure you let your boss know when you perform well			0
do n't brag , but forward any positive feedback you get from clients or colleagues if you 're looking for a job , piece together an impressive portfolio or résumé			0
think about the awards you 've won , leadership positions you 've held , and references who will speak glowingly about you			0
do n't play meek when it comes to finding a new job because employers do n't have time to beg you to talk about yourself			0
impress them from the beginning			0
( and if you can afford to plaster your face on the side of a bus , go ahead			0
know when to move on what @entity5 did : in 2003 , at the peak of his career ( up to that point ) , he decided to retire			1
barely 34 , @entity5 felt he could n't top himself , so he decided to walk away			1
( that said , he un-retired a few years later , which is something we have criticized before , too			0
so do n't cry " wolf " either			0
" ) what you can do : @entity5 retired , but most of us do n't have that luxury right now			1
however , if you 're just going through the motions and the excitement and passion you once had are lacking , then do n't be afraid to look around			0
maybe you need to talk to your boss , find a new job or get into a new industry			0
whatever is right for you , make that move			0
if you 're spending 40 hours each week doing a job that bores you , then you 're wasting a lot of your life			1
you 'll be so much happier and more productive if you 're interested in what you do			0
be willing to shake things up what @entity5 did : when @entity5 took over @entity191 records in 2005 , he could n't believe that the business model had n't changed for decades , and employees had no incentive to work hard			1
he wanted to see people trying new things -- taking risks and competing to be more innovative than the other			0
so he held a retreat with the employees , told them what he wanted , and then began to transform the organization			0
@entity3 notes how people were intrigued by the fact that @entity5 wanted to learn as much as he could about the business			1
what you can do : when you 're not the boss , you ca n't revamp the organization			0
but workers can get the attention of the boss and other leadership by coming forward with new ideas			0
if you 're the person interacting with customers every day , you know when the process can be improved and what would make your job more efficient and maybe bring the company more money			0
always be respectful , but do n't be afraid to be bold once in a while			0
it can be the only way you stand out sometimes			0
manage your private life what @entity5 did : @entity5 and @entity226 are basically music royalty , and when they began quietly dating , everybody wanted to know about it			1
yet , they would n't comment on their romance , and even to this day the married couple is tight - lipped about any personal information			0
therefore you hear more about his and her music than about their personal lives , unlike some famous people			1
what you can do : you do n't need to keep your marriage a secret from your manager , unless you want to , but your weekend partying or marital bickering do n't belong at work			2
often , professionals decide to post @entity248 photos of their drunken adventures or get into a big fight with a spouse over the phone so that the entire office hears			0
suddenly your personal drama overshadows your hard work			0
remember that your professional reputation is a significant factor in promotions , raises and even layoffs			0
do n't let a killer keg stand undo your years of hard work			0
of course , there are a lot of other things @entity5 's done right in his career , so i suggest checking out " @entity4			1
" it 's especially refreshing if you 're a music fan and / or someone who 's not keen on the typical career guides			1
