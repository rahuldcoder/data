-- " there 's only one method of manipulation that has stood the test of time , " begins the press release issued by @entity7 , a new dating app developed by @entity10 grad @entity9			1
" in fact , it 's this alleged truism -- which , by the way , is n't true at all given that highly effective methods of manipulation such as lying , rationalization , denial and guilt are still very much going strong -- that inspired @entity7 , " the world 's first bribe - for - a - date app. " this app lets users entice potential partners into romantic outings by offering them gifts such as " plastic surgery or a tank of gas , " because " messaging may get her interested , but bribery will get you a date			1
it 's pretty clear the founders of this app , not to mention the author of the press release , are actively courting outrage -- a quote from the founder reads , goadingly , " women like presents like dog like treats			1
" but the fact that this level of misogyny is being monetized and marketed and put into practice is disturbing			0
someone , after all , gave this guy the funds to build the app and its companion website ; @entity9 told reporters @entity58 already has 30,000 users of both genders signed up			1
and misogynistic it is : although women can bribe men to go out with them , too , taglines that include " @entity65 ! " imply which scenario @entity7 is aiming at			1
perhaps @entity9 is just trying to be cheeky			0
this is n't , after all , the first time he 's been called a misogynist or sought to monetize sexism			1
carrot is just the latest in a fleet of dating sites @entity9 has founded			1
they include @entity75 , a " sugar daddy dating " site that pairs young women with rich , older men ; @entity81 , where men bid on dates with women ; and @entity85 , which links up " attractive " women with " generous " men who want a travel companion			1
all three have been accused of promoting prostitution , or at least a prostitutory ethos , and that 's become something of a go - to for @entity9			1
he gets bolder , not to mention richer , with every launch and with every piece of corresponding publicity , even if it 's negative -- and unsurprisingly , most of it is			1
such misogyny , even if employed as part of a marketing strategy or a business shtick , has considerable effects , none of which should be taken lightly			0
misogyny is a serious form of bullying directed explicitly at women			2
over time , it affects the way women think about themselves			2
by casting men as the chasers and women as the chased , the values and actions encouraged by @entity7 promote sexism , violence against women and other gender imbalances that men and women have worked for years to counter			2
a 2007 study published in the @entity124 even found that vicarious exposure to misogyny , just simply witnessing such hostility against others , can create lower well - being among those not directly harassed			0
@entity7 claims to be performing a service ; that is , motivating people to go on dates with those they otherwise might reject , thereby removing some of the existing barriers to romance and " opening minds			0
" @entity9 says @entity7 is entirely modern , set to even the playing field in a world where , he says , women have the upper hand and their pick of men			2
but his app seeks to do this by validating the notion that it 's normal to expect something from a date other than , say , good conversation or pleasant company ; that going on a date should only happen if there 's something material in it for you			1
not exactly a recipe for true love			0
but , then , @entity7 is n't really about opening people 's minds and expanding their options			2
it 's about stirring up controversy , with hapless @entity7 users			2
at the same time , what he 's stirring up is not victimless controversy			2
at its core , @entity58 reinforces the notion that women can , and should , be bought -- the same attitude , by the way , that has made human trafficking a $ 34 billion business			0
the upside : one could argue that sites such as @entity7 satisfy a certain , very specific demographic and serve to connect only like - minded singles			0
the site may be crass , superficial and self - loathing , but then again so are many people			0
why not let them mate ? or at least meet			0
the more of these people who date each other using sites such as @entity58 , the fewer of them remain among those who might be looking for more in a partner than a free haircut or a new nose			0
those who are attracted to @entity7 , or sites like it , know what they 're getting			0
as for everyone else , well , at least they know what they 're not			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

new app lets you bribe a potential date with " plastic surgery or a tank of gas "
