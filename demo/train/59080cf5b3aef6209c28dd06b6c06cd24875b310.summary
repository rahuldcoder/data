the arson , however , would only be a diversion to tie up emergency responders while he carried out the main plot at the school , police said			2
he 'd planned to set off " numerous bombs " during the lunch hour at @entity78 , then kill the school resource officer , police said			1
then he 'd unleash gunfire on students until police officers arrived , allegedly planning to let them kill him			1
armed to the teeth the teen 's cache in the storage locker contained just pieces of the puzzle			1
police got a search warrant and at 10:30 p.m. arrived at @entity20 's home , where he lived with his family			1
behind that door lay finished bombs , " numerous guns " and ammunition , police say			1
and they found @entity25 's neatly laid plan journaled onto paper			2
