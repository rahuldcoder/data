-- the @entity2 government wants to make sure your high is safe			1
in an attempt to tackle the popularity of new - generation synthetic party drugs -- sold widely in convenience stores and blamed for triggering a spate of mental health issues -- @entity2 authorities have taken a radical new tack			1
a new law shifts the onus to the makers of synthetic recreational drugs , forcing them to conduct clinical tests to prove their products are safe -- similar to the way pharmaceuticals are regulated			1
it 's the first nation to take a dramatically different approach to psychoactive substances like party pills and synthetic marijuana -- which the @entity28 has flagged as an alarming drug problem			1
some psychoactive substances go by names like bath salts , spice or meow - meow			1
in a 119 - to - 1 vote on thursday , the country 's parliament passed the @entity38 , establishing a framework for testing , manufacturing and selling such recreational drugs			1
the new law does not apply to non-synthetic drugs like marijuana , cocaine or magic mushrooms			1
in a country that prides itself as a " social laboratory , " @entity2 has become " a laboratory in every sense : for the approval of new recreational drugs , " according to an editorial in the @entity50			1
the drug law enjoyed broad support although there was debate over whether animal testing would be required in the clinical tests			1
" while other countries are still blindly banning drug after drug , the @entity38 will put @entity2 ahead of the industry 's game , " said @entity61 , the @entity62 's executive director in a statement in support of the law			1
" it is a comprehensive , pragmatic and innovative approach to address a complex problem			2
" this contrasts with countries where substances are legal until the governments ban them			0
chemical concoctions come out fairly routinely -- far outpacing efforts to control them			0
when one product is banned , " there are two or three or four replacements in the market , " said @entity61			0
and authorities ca n't prevent the drug makers from selling new concoctions			1
" you ca n't ban what yet does n't exist , " @entity61 said			0
" the government is n't in the position to pre-empt these things			0
" @entity2 is unique because of its remote geography , he added			2
" it 's because we 're a small remote country , " he said			0
" drugs like heroine do n't make their way to @entity2			1
what we 've become good at doing is making our own drugs			2
" psychoactive substances have raised concerns over their ingredients and effects			2
some are known to cause paranoia , hallucinations , convulsions and psychotic episodes			0
" in lots of ways , this synthetic cannabis is way worse than the real stuff with a number of people who are becoming psychotic as a result , " said dr. @entity110 , the chair of the @entity111			2
under the law , new psychoactive drugs can not be sold unless they pass health regulations			1
that process will be determined by the country 's @entity123			0
the new regulation " has to be rigorous and robust enough to stand up to public scrutiny			0
to be licensed , to be legal , it has to pass testing like new medicine in the market , " said @entity127 , general manager of the advocacy group , @entity130 , which represents members of the legal high industry in the country			0
the industry wants to " be recognized as other highs " such as alcohol and tobacco , he added			0
@entity127 said he expects the industry to take a hit on profits as they 'll now have to submit costly and lengthy applications to be be sold on the market			0
but he views it as an investment			0
" you have take a long term view , " @entity127 said			0
" it 's a legitimate industry that provides certified low - risk product so people can enjoy them safely			2
that 's a much better business model than the better cat - and - mouse game the industry plays with the government			2
" here is what else the @entity38 entails : - restricts where and how psychoactive drugs are sold - prohibits sales to minors - restricts labeling and packaging of products - gives existing products a grace period to begin application process			1

@entity2 @entity170 passes new drug law 119 - 1
recreational drug makers can sell products if they prove its safety
law only applies to synthetic drugs , not marijuana , cocaine , etc
@entity2 is first to change its tactic on psychoactive drugs
