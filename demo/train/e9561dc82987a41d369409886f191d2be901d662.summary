@entity0 is convening a landmark @entity2 on countering violent extremism with key international leaders in an attempt to develop an urgently needed plan to tackle terrorism and radicalization across the world			0
the importance of the summit was brought into sharp focus , yet again , with the terror attacks in @entity15 over the weekend			2
while the facts of the case are still being pieced together , @entity20 intelligence agencies are " operating under a theory " that the attacker may have been inspired by the horrific events in @entity23 last month			0
nearly a decade and a half after the 9/11 attacks , there remains a key flaw in the ongoing @entity29 - led " @entity28 : " @entity31 's response has been hyper - militarized , dominated by counter-terrorism and security , while other soft power instruments like public diplomacy have been under - invested in			1
to be sure , even this badly unbalanced strategy has secured some key successes , including the unseating of the @entity40 regime in @entity41			0
but an overwhelming emphasis on hard power has fueled significant controversy and alienated many across the world			0
@entity0 recognizes this much more so than his predecessor @entity48 , but the fact remains that @entity29 policy is still viewed internationally as overly military and security - focused			1
since @entity0 assumed office , there has been a huge increase in drone attacks and this is controversial both domestically and overseas			0
@entity29 secretary of state @entity56 highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in the campaign on terrorism only last month , calling for a " shift in gears onto a path that will demand more from us ... politically , economically , and socially ... a truly comprehensive and long - term strategy to destroy [ terrorism 's ] very roots			1
" @entity56 's argument is that while military power can degrade terrorist groups like @entity71 , it ca n't defeat or destroy the ideology behind it			0
for that , a much wider , holistic effort is needed			0
and with the 70th anniversary of the end of the @entity78 approaching , @entity56 compared this forthcoming challenge with what @entity31 and its international allies faced in tackling fascism in that previous generation			1
one of the most glaring gaps that now badly needs to be addressed is need for a turbo - charged soft - power effort to win hearts and minds around the world			1
as @entity0 has said , this must include an " alternative narrative " for a disaffected generation , especially in muslim - majority countries			0
@entity0 summit aims to battle extremists , @entity96 and otherwise in numerous key countries such as @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , polls show that positive opinions toward the @entity29 have fallen off a cliff in the last decade and a half			1
just 10 % , 12 % , and 14 % of the populations in these three countries , respectively , have a positive image of @entity29 , according to the latest @entity108			1
this is key because the anti-terrorism contest is , in essence , one whose outcome is related to a battle between moderates and extremists within @entity96 civilizations			0
and unless this fundamental is better recognized and addressed , with soft power dialled up significantly , the @entity29 - led international strategy will continue to face serious setbacks , if not outright failure			1
in the context of the campaign against terrorism , soft power represents the capacity of @entity31 and its allies to persuade others ( both states and individuals ) without brute force -- in other words , the ability to attract others by legitimacy of policies and the values that underpin them			1
the roadmap for what is needed is relatively clear			0
seizing the moment requires the @entity29 and international partners to give much higher priority to non-military , civilian instruments of national power such as public diplomacy , strategic communications , foreign aid and development assistance , and exchange programs			1
at wednesday 's summit , @entity0 will rightly note that this is an expensive , demanding and complex generational project that the @entity29 and its allies can not achieve alone -- which is why multiple international leaders from other arenas like the private sector , ngos and faith communities will also be in attendance			2
while @entity56 last month drew an analogy with the @entity78 , it is the @entity161 that perhaps provides an even better comparison with what is now needed in the campaign against terrorism			0
just like the @entity161 , which was ultimately won by a strategy of @entity29 - led international containment and cultural vigor , the challenges posed by the campaign against terrorism need a much smarter balance between hard and soft power , with resources to match			1
numerous @entity29 officials , including former @entity48 and @entity0 defense secretary @entity173 , have highlighted the gross mismatch between the current budgets of the @entity176 and other @entity29 international programs			2
today , for instance , @entity31 spends about 500 times more on its military than it does collectively on the international broadcasting and exchanges that proved so successful during the @entity161			2
of course a comprehensive international plan to tackle violent extremism will inevitably have a military and counter-terrorism component			0
but soft power needs to become a much bigger part of the overall mix , as even @entity173 , the former @entity176 chief , advocates			1
@entity29 and its international partners must urgently address this achilles heel in the campaign against terrorism			2
while a limited window of opportunity exists to get this agenda kick - started before @entity0 's term of office ends , a sustained commitment will be required for many years beyond his presidency .			2

14 years after 9/11 attacks , there remains a key flaw in the @entity29 - led ' war on terror '
response hyper - militarized , neglecting soft power tools like public diplomacy
@entity31 and allies will only win war with legitimacy of policies and values
