the developments have prompted officials to form a local , state and federal task force to investigate the homicides			0
a state lab is working to determine whether the dna of at least 23 other slain prostitutes matches that of the killer			1
" in the past , we might have linked some of these homicides through their method of operation , but theory has given way to technology , " said @entity43 , the @entity3 police chief			1
" within the last couple of weeks , we have been able to confirm a link			0
" @entity43 , who described the killer as an " unknown suspect who conducts his business in secret , " said the investigation would require tips from the community			1
" this suspect has been able to avoid and evade law enforcement for these last 23 years			1
he has never been arrested for a felony as he does not appear in any dna database , " @entity43 said			1
police said 42 prostitutes were killed between 1986 and 2007 , and that 31 percent of the cases have been solved			2
there has been a higher clearance rate -- 78 percent -- in other homicides			0

however , he said there is no link with the @entity3 cases			2
in discussing advances in dna technology , @entity43 said there were no matches in 1990s , two around 2000 and the seven have been linked in recent weeks			0
" we already have determined that five suspects in murders of other prostitutes -- completely unrelated to this investigation -- have been identified because their @entity89 match open homicide cases			1
