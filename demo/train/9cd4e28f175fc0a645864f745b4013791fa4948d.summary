-- last saturday , @entity1 stood before the huge crowd at the 2014 @entity4 annual meeting and condemned liberals for coddling terrorists			1
she loaded her speech with religious metaphors , claiming that true leaders would put " the fear of @entity11 in our enemies			1
" she said , " they obviously have information on plots to carry out jihad			2
oh , but you ca n't offend them , ca n't make them feel uncomfortable , not even a smidgen			0
well , if i were in charge , they would know that waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists			1
" @entity1 's invocation of forced baptism shocked both conservatives and liberals , inspiring few defenders			1
christian commentators , in particular , focused on her link between torture and baptism			2
on wednesday , the @entity36 released a powerful condemnation of the speech			0
to @entity1 , the organization 's executive director wrote , " your statements play into a false narrative conveying that somehow , the conflict between the @entity45 and the terrorist cells is a conflict between @entity47 and @entity48 , or @entity48 and ' the @entity49			1
' " the group 's letter to the @entity4 , signed by 17 faith leaders from many different religions and denominations , reads , " for @entity56 , baptism is a profoundly holy act			1
it is in stark contrast to the abhorrent act of waterboarding			2
equating baptism to an act of torture like waterboarding is sacrilegious -- and particularly surprising coming from a person who prides herself on her @entity47 faith			1
" but it 's not actually all that surprising			2
@entity1 's public rhetoric relies on crafting existential binaries between " us " and " them , " creating a kind of sacred empowered victimhood among her listeners			1
she draws from the language of militant @entity47 to claim the status of both persecutor and persecuted			0
this is not an accident , and i do not believe she will repudiate her remarks			1
while people of faith such as the @entity36 are concerned about blasphemy , i worry about history			0
when powerful @entity56 such as @entity1 start speaking about forced baptism to a cheering throng , they evoke , intentionally or not , some of the worst episodes in @entity47 history			1
on @entity96 1349 , the citizens of @entity94 , @entity95 , rose up against the @entity98 population of their city			1
the @entity100 of @entity101 describes it as follows : " and so , on the following saturday ( february 14 ) , the @entity98 were conducted to the cemetery to be burnt in a specifically prepared house			1
and 200 of them were completely stripped of their clothes by the mob , who found a lot of money in them			0
but the few who chose baptism were spared , and many beautiful women were persuaded to accept baptism , and many children were baptized after they were snatched from mothers who refused this invitation			0
all the rest were burnt , and many were killed as they leaped out of the fire			0
" this is just one of the many examples of forced baptism of @entity98 and @entity124 under threat of massacre			1
the @entity98 were forced into a building , stripped , robbed and burned alive			1
their only pathway out was through baptism and rape			0
as parents died , babies were taken from their mothers to be baptized			0
the church condemned these practices , but if someone went into a church and was baptized , even under threat of death , it counted			0
such issues led to the terrible excesses of the @entity143 in which forcibly converted @entity98 and @entity124 were held under constant scrutiny and suspicion			1
when @entity1 stood before the huge crowd of mostly white people , she told her audience to be afraid and to be prepared for civilian violence			1
she spoke about " that evil @entity124 terrorist @entity150 ... his @entity151 ( sic ) praising jihad			2
" she said , " ammo is expensive , do n't waste a bullet on a warning shot			0
" she divided the world between " us " and " them , " with no room for dialogue			0
at one point she pretended to apologize for saying all liberals were hypocrites , then joked , redrawing the divisive line , " i 'm kidding , yes they are			2
" finally , she said , " if i were in charge , " and paused to let crowd cheer			0
then , with great deliberation , she linked a torture method that makes the sufferer feel like they are dying to the ritual of @entity47 inclusion			2
" thank @entity11 , " she said , " more and more @entity45 are waking up			0
" i do n't read her invocation of a deity as accidental			0
for @entity1 , this is a holy struggle			2
last sunday was n't the first time @entity1 used rhetoric invoking one of the worst chapters of @entity47 history			1
in january 2011 , in the wake of the @entity186 shooting in @entity187 , she and some right - wing defenders used the term " blood libel " to describe those linking the shooting to @entity1 's martial rhetoric			1
( she had used on her website a map with cross hairs on @entity186 ' district )			0
blood libel refers to the medieval myth that @entity98 murdered @entity47 children in religious rituals and baked their blood into matzos for @entity203			1
it 's a myth that has resulted in massacres of @entity98 for centuries			1
i appreciate the efforts of the @entity36 and others to contest this language in public			0
we ca n't pretend , though , that @entity1 's invocation was an aberration or that her status as a failed politician makes her irrelevant			1
the crowd was cheering ; then they went into the exhibition hall to buy weapons			0
@entity1 and her followers want it both ways			2
they are the persecuted chosen people of @entity11 , targeted by lies and threatened with violence by those who do not share their faith			0
they are also the @entity47 triumphalists , ready for a @entity228 in which all will be converted or destroyed			0
this is not a joke or an accident			0
this is not new rhetoric			2
and it never ends well .			0

@entity1 told @entity4 meeting , " waterboarding is how we baptize terrorists "
*interfaith* group of religious leaders called on her , @entity4 to repudiate those remarks
@entity245 : equating torture with religious *sacrament* evokes horrors of the past
he says @entity1 's divisive rhetoric evokes persecution of @entity98 and @entity124
