-- the robust approach of the @entity3 side in the @entity5 final has drawn a fierce rebuke from @entity8 legend @entity7 , who accused them of " dirty " play and adopting " anti-football " tactics			1
@entity7 was the star player of the revered @entity8 team of the 1974 @entity5 that introduced the concept " total football " to the world			1
@entity15 and @entity16 were the @entity3 's outfield players from their starting 11 not to be booked by referee @entity18 , while @entity19 saw red in extra-time for a second bookable offence as @entity22 won 1 - 0 at @entity23 on sunday			1
@entity7 , who coached @entity24 after his playing days were over , believes @entity25 and @entity26 were very fortunate to avoid red cards for challenges in the first half			2
@entity31 midfielder @entity30 , in particular , has come under criticism for his " kung - fu " style challenge which left @entity35 nursing bruised ribs			0
" regrettably , sadly , they played very dirty			0
so much so that they should have been down to nine immediately , they made two ugly and hard tackles that even i felt the damage , " wrote @entity7			2
" this ugly , vulgar , hard , hardly eye - catching , lack of football style served the @entity8 to unsettle @entity22			1
if with this they got satisfaction , fine , but they ended up losing			0
" some practiced anti-football considering that it was the only way to survive			0
it finished 0 - 0 ( after regulation play ) because they ( @entity22 ) could not play as they wanted			1
" referee @entity18 also comes under criticism for failing to act tougher as he handed out a string of yellow cards without using the ultimate sanction until @entity19 was sent off deep into extra-time			0
" you can referee badly , but what you can not do is create your own type of justice and , worse , invent a personal application of the rules , " @entity7 said			0
" not only did he fail to expel two @entity66 , including ( @entity68 ) @entity67 who deserved the second yellow , he also looked the other way at times in which he had to get involved			0
" a @entity5 final deserves a big referee , but above all , it deserves a referee who dares to do everything it means to be judge			2
" @entity7 was named man of the tournament at the 1974 @entity5 , but his team lost the final 2 - 1 to @entity82			1
he did not play in the 1978 @entity5 where the @entity8 again lost in the final to @entity83 .			2

@entity7 accuses them of adopting " anti-football " football tactics in 1 - 0 loss to @entity22
