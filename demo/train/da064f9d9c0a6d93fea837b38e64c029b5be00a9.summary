without any details , the report said authorities had undertaken a " one - year crackdown on violent terrorist activities " in the volatile region after blasts in the heavily policed city of @entity21 killed at least 39 people and wounded more than 90 , according to state media			1
the number of dead does not include the attackers			0
the state news agency reported friday that five attackers were responsible for the blasts ; four were killed in the explosions , and a fifth was arrested thursday			1
they were identified through dna testing , @entity2 said			0
in @entity21 , authorities tightened security checks at entry ports in an attempt to curb weapons smuggling , including inspections of individuals , luggage , transport facilities and postal deliveries at land border crossings , @entity2 reported friday			1
after visiting the injured and the scene of the explosions , @entity44 , minister of public security , called for severe punishment for those responsible , state media said			1
president @entity49 also called for the terrorists behind it to be " severely " punished			0
two suvs slammed into shoppers gathered at the market in @entity21 at 7:50 a.m. thursday , and explosives were flung out of the vehicles , @entity2 said			2
the vehicles then exploded , according to the news agency			1
some of the photos circulating on social media suggested a hellish scene , with bodies strewn on the ground amid burning wreckage			2
others showed flames and smoke billowing out of the end of a tree - lined street guarded by police			2
' an enormous sound ' " i heard an enormous sound , then i looked out from my balcony , " said a resident of a building near the explosion who would only give his surname , @entity78			0
he told @entity1 that trees obscured much of his view of the scene , but that he " could see there was chaos , with people injured			2
" many of the victims caught in the blasts were elderly people who regularly visited the morning market , @entity2 reported			0
" it 's mainly people coming to trade vegetables , especially the elderly who get up early and buy vegetables to cook , " @entity78 said			2
the @entity97 government condemned the attack			0

string of recent attacks @entity3 authorities have stepped up security measures in @entity9 in recent months amid a series of attacks within the region and in other major @entity3 cities			1
on wednesday , @entity2 reported that 39 people had been sentenced to prison in the past two months for " inciting violence " in @entity9			1
but thursday 's devastating blasts suggest the government is facing a foe determined to wreak havoc			1
the market attack comes less than a month after an explosion hit a train station in @entity21 , killing three people and wounding 79 others			0
the april 30 blast occurred just after @entity49 had wrapped up a visit to the region			0
ethnic tensions @entity3 officials have linked a mass knife attack in march that killed 29 people at a train station in the southwestern city of @entity136 to @entity138 separatists from @entity9			1
they have also blamed separatists for an october attack in @entity141 's @entity140 in which a car rammed into a pedestrian bridge and burst into flames , killing two tourists and the three occupants of the vehicle			0
the knife - wielding assailants in the @entity136 attack and the people in the car that hit @entity140 were identified as @entity153 , a @entity156 - speaking , predominantly @entity155 ethnic group from @entity9			2
ethnic tensions between @entity153 and @entity160 people , millions of whom have migrated to resource - rich @entity9 in recent decades , have repeatedly boiled over into deadly riots and clashes with authorities in recent years			1
some @entity153 have expressed resentment over harsh treatment from @entity3 security forces and @entity160 people taking the lion 's share of economic opportunities in @entity9			1
the @entity160 are the predominant ethnic group in @entity3 , making up more than 90 % of the overall population			1
shift in targets the pattern of ethnic violence in the region goes back decades , according to @entity177 , an expert in ethnic relations in @entity3 at @entity179 in @entity180 , @entity181			2
" but what 's new , and what i think is significant , is that we have a shift in target , " @entity177 said			0
" we have a targeting of innocent civilians , places where innocent civilians gather -- an attempt to maim innocent civilians in large numbers			0
" the other change is that the violence has " seeped outside " the borders of @entity9 into other parts of @entity3 , he said			2
it remains unclear who is behind the recent high - profile attacks			0
@entity3 officials have pointed to a murky separatist group , the @entity203 , which they have blamed for violent acts in the past			1
@entity206 is the name used by many @entity153 groups to refer to @entity9			0
but analysts are divided about the extent of the that group 's activities and its links to global terrorist networks such as @entity215			1
" generally , the government response is to blame terrorists without providing many details , " @entity177 said			0
" so i suspect it 's going to be very difficult to get to the bottom of this incident like previous ones			0
" @entity223 : @entity9 and tensions in @entity3 's restive far west			1
