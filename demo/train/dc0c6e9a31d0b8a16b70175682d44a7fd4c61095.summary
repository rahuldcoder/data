-- the purpose of terror is to terrorize			0
though questions remain about those responsible for the attack , the horrendous bombing attack on the @entity4 sought to instill paralyzing fear , inflict debilitating trauma and force us to forfeit our freedom			1
we can not let terror win			0
we -- @entity14 and @entity15 -- live in open societies that enable us to celebrate our freedom			1
whether in arts festivals , sporting events , craft fairs or merely playing with our kids in the park , we are upholding those liberties in the face of those seeking to deny them			0
at the same time , we know that our freedoms must be defended , sometimes by men and women in uniform but most poignantly by people refusing to succumb to fear			2
we beat terror by refusing to submit			2
the people of @entity33 , who on the day of the bombing were celebrating liberty 's birthday , will not submit			1
our experience in @entity15 has taught us that communities and caregivers , police and security forces , elected leaders and volunteers can unite at such times and block the terrorists from achieving their objectives			1
while taking all possible measures to prevent further loss of life , we adamantly refuse to forfeit our way of life			0
anyone who has suffered the agony of terror knows the pain of the victims and their families as well as the radius of the emotional damage inflicted on countless citizens			1
we know that at such times , communities can band together and help bind the psychological and physical wounds			0
when first responders rush through the smoke , risking their own lives to assist the fallen , the healing process begins			0
and the people of @entity33 will heal			1
still , the democratic liberties that @entity14 and @entity15 enjoy can not be taken for granted			1
@entity14 security forces and policy - makers face complex challenges			1
we must appreciate their successes in thwarting many attacks			0
we will continue to embrace freedom , but we will remain vigilant and resolute			0
this attack in @entity33 reminds us of both the worst and best in humanity			2
in an act of terror , those responsible destroyed and forever altered the lives of hundreds of people			0
but , stories of the heroic first responders , the athletes who ran to the hospital to donate blood and the countless other acts of selflessness remind us of the @entity14 spirit and its capacity to overcome terror and emerge stronger			2
we comfort the bereaved , tend to the hurt and take all precautions			0
we remember the victims but , standing together , refuse to be victimized			1
