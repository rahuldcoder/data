-- @entity1 heard the sound of running water in her @entity4 , @entity5 , home on monday for the first time in four days after a chemical leak fouled water supplies for hundreds of thousands of people			1
@entity1 was one of the first 5,000 customers , many of them large commercial users , who were told they could start flushing out their pipes after thousands of gallons of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol poured out of from a storage facility on the nearby @entity18 on thursday			1
the licorice - scented chemical , typically used to clean coal , got into @entity4 's water supply , resulting in 300,000 people being told not to drink , cook or wash with water from their own taps			1
" i knew a licorice smell in the air was something that could n't be good , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
" i did n't think it was candy			0
" the @entity29 said it had lifted the do - not - use order for 26,000 customers by the end of the day			1
@entity33 the final traces of contaminants from home and business water pipes could take days , said @entity38 , the water company 's president			1
and officials asked that water customers not rush to turn on their faucets until told to do so , for fear that demand could cause pressure in the lines to falter , introducing yet more problems			1
" it 's certainly going to go into tomorrow , and i 'm not sure how much longer , " @entity49 , the head of the state @entity50 , told @entity0 's @entity52			2
@entity54 status map the state put water restrictions into effect thursday after discovering that about 7,500 gallons of the chemical , known as @entity59 , had leaked into the @entity18 just above a drinking water plant			1
authorities told residents in nine @entity5 counties to stop using their water for everything except flushing toilets , and to watch for symptoms of exposure such as skin irritation , nausea , vomiting or wheezing			2
the spill left @entity4 residents scrambling for bottled water to wash their hands , brush their teeth and cook			1
without safe water , schools and many businesses were forced to close			2
the @entity81 @entity80 and the water company trucked in bottled water , and police , firefighters and @entity87 troops helped distribute it around @entity4 , where resident @entity88 reported that most stores had been restocked by monday			1
" disposable plates and utensils , etc. are in short supply but some local churches are giving those away , " @entity88 wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" we are definitely trying to prevent dirty dishes but they are stacking up quickly			0
the problem is that when they say the water is fine to drink , do we believe them ? " she 's not alone in her doubts			1
" i 'm not going to drink it for a while , " @entity4 resident @entity105 said			1
and @entity1 said , " i will be concerned probably for the rest of the time that i live here			0
" but @entity110 , who works in the first zone allowed to begin using water , said he 's sure county , state and water company officials have done all they need to do to ensure water safety			1
" i 'm tickled to death to get my water back , " he said monday afternoon			1
by monday morning , water tests showed that levels of the chemical detected at water intakes had declined to well under the 1 part per million safety standard for consumption			1
finished water showed even less of the contaminant , but people would probably still smell the chemical in their water even after flushing , @entity49 said			2
some residents have complained of irritation of the skin , throat , chest and stomach , dr. @entity131 of the @entity132 said over the weekend			0
as of monday morning , hospitals had seen 231 people for complaints related to contaminated water , admitting 14 of them , said @entity143 , secretary of the state 's @entity144			2
but calls to poison control centers had been declining , she said			0
but the unknowns made residents anxious			0
" they do n't even know what the health risks are , " @entity150 of @entity151 told @entity0 affiliate @entity152			0
" we had bathed , cooked and everything right before the news came on ( with the water warning )			2
" more than 20 lawsuits had already been filed , and a @entity4 judge ordered the company at the source of the leak , @entity165 , and @entity5 @entity81 to preserve all relevant documents and physical evidence monday			2
absorbent booms lowered into the @entity18 to contain the spill are coming out clean of any contaminants and without any odor , suggesting that the material has stopped leaking into the river , said @entity174 , chief of the @entity176 's @entity80 and @entity175			1
he said the agency is sending pumping equipment to the site to help deal with heavy rain expected soon in a bid to prevent any contamination from escaping from the site in runoff			0
no problems have been detected with fish kills or other effects on wildlife , @entity49 said			0
@entity174 said earlier that the chemical leaked through a 1 - inch hole in the wall of a storage tank owned by @entity165 , which supplies products for the coal mining industry			1
it moved through the soil into the river			0
officials do n't know exactly when the leak began , but they do n't think it was long before thursday morning , when it was first reported			0
@entity165 president @entity202 said two @entity204 employees noticed material leaking from a storage tank into a dike about 10:30 a.m. thursday			1
they contacted authorities and began the cleanup process , including hauling away the chemical still in the tank and vacuuming some from the nearby ground , he said			2
@entity214 , deputy emergency manager for @entity215 , said the tank appeared to be " antique			0
" he told @entity0 on saturday that the company " did n't appear to understand the magnitude of the incident at the time			0
" " i never got a good indication from the plant folks how bad the leak was , how much was going to the river , anything else			0
it was probably a little ways into the incident before we realized how bad it was getting into the river			0
" @entity0 's @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
