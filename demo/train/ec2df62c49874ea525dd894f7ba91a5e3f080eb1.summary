@entity1 , @entity0 -- the debate about using technology to help referees has been re-ignited following a number of controversial decisions in the @entity9 semi-final between @entity10 and @entity11			2
the @entity13 system is already widely used in tennis and has transformed the game			1
@entity16 , president of @entity17 , the game 's governing body , has consistently opposed the use of in - game video replays , but goal - line technology , to determine if the ball has crossed the goal line , has received more support			1
the @entity13 system is extensively used in tennis , using cameras to calculate the trajectory of the ball			1
the system then uses the trajectory data to determine exactly where the ball has hit the ground , making it invaluable for marginal line calls			0
using similar technology , @entity36 , based in @entity0 , has developed a football system to determine if a goal has been scored			2
it again uses cameras to track the ball and computers to calculate its position			0
if the system detects that the ball has crossed the goal line a central computer transmits a signal to the referee via either a watch or earpiece			0
the system was tested at @entity55 football club @entity54 in 2006 and then at @entity57 's training ground in 2007			0
it was backed by the @entity59 and funded by the @entity55			0
another goal - line technology , a microchipped football , was developed by @entity62 and @entity64 firm @entity63			1
a microchip built into the football detects a magnetic field generated by underground cables in the penalty area			0
like the @entity13 system it uses a computer to send a signal to the referee 's watch when a goal is scored			1
the system was tested at the @entity77 in 2005 and the 2007 @entity78 in @entity79			0
the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , which decides the laws of the game , discusses new rules at an annual general meeting consisting of four representatives from @entity17 and one each from @entity0 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
explaining the @entity80 's decision , @entity16 said the microchipped ball had failed in one of the seven @entity78 matches because of interference to the signal sent to the referee and that it would be difficult to implement the chip technology in the many types of football used around the world			2
he added that it was not possible to ensure that the @entity13 system worked in a crowded goalmouth , where players might block the cameras ' view of the ball			1
" fifa are of the opinion that the systems are very costly , would not add anything to the game and would harm the position of the referee , " the @entity108 's @entity107 reported at the time			0
do you think goal - line technology should be used ? share your thoughts in the @entity120 box below			1
but @entity13 managing director @entity121 told @entity2 that he believes @entity17 has decided that it does n't want technology in football			2
" i saw @entity17 last week and told them that we can provide a system if they want it , but it 's very clear they do n't want the system , " he said			0
@entity121 said his company can not develop the technology any further without more testing in real stadiums , but that kind of testing requires @entity17 's consent			0
the idea that football 's governing bodies are opposed to more technology in football has been supported by statements from the sport 's governing bodies			0
in march 2009 , @entity16 said in a statement : " the @entity80 believes that football is a game for human beings and , as such , we should improve the standard of refereeing - and not turn to technology			2
" @entity151 , president of @entity152 , @entity154 's governing body , has expressed similar views			0
instead of pursuing goal - line technology , the @entity80 chose to trial the idea of having two extra match officials , one behind each goal			1
a @entity17 spokesman told @entity2 that while the use of goal - line technology has n't been ruled out forever , even after recent refereeing controversies , the @entity80 's current position is to continue to experiment with extra officials			1
the @entity80 's decision means there will be no goal - line technology used in the @entity9 final on 27 may , which means there is the potential for more refereeing disputes			1
" maybe there will be a controversial goal in the @entity9 final and maybe the discussion over the technology will begin again , " @entity175 , marketing and communications director at @entity63 told @entity2			0
@entity121 agrees that it will take a controversial goal - line incident in a big @entity17 match to get the @entity80 to change their position , saying it took a series of contentious calls at the @entity188 for tennis authorities to seriously consider using the @entity13 system			1
if that is the case , there will be some football fans hoping for plenty of goal - line drama come may 27 .			1

debate over whether technology should be used to help referees
@entity17 is opposed to video replays but has considered goal - line technology
@entity13 system and microchipped footballs were *rejected* by @entity80
some feel it will take a big - match controversy to *re-open* the debate
