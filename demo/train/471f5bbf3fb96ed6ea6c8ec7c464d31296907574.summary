@entity0 , @entity1 -- chanting " @entity3 " -- @entity4 is greater than any -- more than 2 million pilgrims crossed new pedestrian bridges saturday to perform one of the last rituals of the @entity10 season			1
jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when @entity14 stoned the devil and rejected his temptations , according to @entity18 traditions			1
the ritual stoning of three pillars , which occurs in the tent city of @entity22 -- about two miles from @entity0 , was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground			1
but this year the @entity1 government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site			0
the government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $ 1.2 billion , five - story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones			1
authorities and pilgrims say it 's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful			2
" everything went fine so far , " col. @entity44 , head of the emergency forces at @entity46 , told @entity2			0
" it is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with			0
about 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual			2
so we have been preparing for this for years now			0
" @entity55 , a pilgrim from the @entity56 , said all went well at the ceremony			0
" the only incident i saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt			0
" but @entity44 said , " there are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped			0
each van can take up to 14 pilgrims			0
" as a measure to alleviate harm , according to @entity18 traditions , the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them			2
the five - story @entity46 bridge is air - conditioned at 19 degrees @entity76 , or @entity77 , throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees c , or 84 @entity80 the bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises			1
according to authorities , the bridge is 950 meters ( 1,039 yards ) long and 80 meters ( 87 yards ) wide			1
each floor is 12 meters ( 13 yards ) high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions			1
it has a helicopter pad for emergencies			0
according to @entity44 , the project has 509 advanced closed - circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims ' movements			2
those cameras feed into the main operations room , which oversees the @entity103 and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room			0
the stoning ritual is done over at least two days , where pilgrims stone three pillars at @entity22 -- believed to be where the @entity14 stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying @entity4 's orders to slaughter his son			1
according to tradition , the event was a test from @entity4 , who gave @entity14 a ram to slaughter instead			1
the last ritual that marks the end of @entity10 is when pilgrims go from @entity22 to @entity0 to make a last visit to @entity126 , @entity127 's holiest site , before going back home			1
the ritual is called @entity130 -- or farewell circumambulation in the holy mosque			0
it 's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city .			2
