( @entity3 ) -- @entity4 no longer make up the majority of people in @entity7 for the first time , according to the latest census data which pointed to a cosmopolitan capital increasingly divergent from the national economy around it			1
the 2011 data also revealed a population of @entity15 and @entity16 that is generally better educated but less religious than it was a decade ago -- and less likely to live in a home that they own			1
the total population rose by 3.7m to 56.1m , an increase of 7 per cent from the previous census in 2001			1
migration was responsible for 60 per cent of that growth -- 2.1m people			1
of the 13 per cent of the population who were born outside the @entity28 -- 7.5m residents -- just more than half arrived within the past 10 years			0
this compares with the 2001 census , when 9 per cent of the population was born outside the @entity28			2
the surge of immigration has been especially striking in @entity7 , where more than one in three people -- 37 per cent -- were born outside the @entity28			2
only 45 per cent of @entity7 's population were white people of @entity15 , @entity39 or @entity41 heritage , according to the latest data , down from almost 60 per cent in 2001			1
this makes @entity7 the first @entity28 region where white ethnic @entity4 have become a minority			1
the top source of new migrants to @entity15 and @entity16 overall for the decade was @entity49 -- supplanting @entity50 in the decade to 2001 -- while the second - biggest source was @entity52			1
in the 2001 census , @entity52 did not make the top 10			1
in another major deomographic shift , home ownership has fallen over the past 10 years , according to this latest data , marking the first decade - on - decade decline since detailed records began 60 years ago			1
the figures show how growing numbers of @entity4 are being locked out of the property market by high prices and a shortage of credit			0
the proportion of residents who either owned their home outright or owned with a mortgage fell to 64 per cent in 2011 , from 68 per cent in 2001 , said the @entity69			2
however , a bigger proportion , 31 per cent , owned their homes outright than they did a decade ago , highlighting a growing divergence between homeowners and those unable to get on the housing ladder			0
" these figures confirm that home ownership is slipping further and further out of reach , no matter how hard people work or save , " said @entity76 , chief executive of @entity77 , the housing charity			0
" young people are living at home well into their 30s ... but unable to afford a place of their own			0
" the percentage of the population renting from private landlords rose 6 percentage points from a decade earlier to 15 per cent			0
overall , the population of @entity15 and @entity16 has become better educated than it was a decade ago			1
a higher percentage have university degrees than have no qualifications , a reversal of the situation in 2001			0
levels of educational attainment in @entity7 are far higher than the national averages , with 27.2 per cent of the national population having attained a university degree or better , compared with 44.7 per cent of those living in inner @entity7			2
indeed , in five of 14 inner @entity7 boroughs , more than half the population have university or equal level qualifications			2
and @entity28 is apparently becoming less religious			0
the question on religious affiliation is voluntary , so not all applicants may have answered it			0
however , the percentage identifying themselves as @entity112 fell to 59 per cent , from 72 per cent in 2001			0
@entity113 was the only religious group to have experienced a fall in numbers , despite the growth in the population generally			2
the second - largest religious identity was none at all			0
in 2011 , a quarter of the population said it had no religious affiliation , up from 15 per cent in 2001 , according to the figures released by the @entity69 on tuesday			1

the latest census data shows that white @entity4 are no longer a majority in @entity7
