@entity0 -- president @entity2 and @entity4 challenger @entity3 face off on wednesday in the first of three presidential debates			1
while @entity2 holds a lead in several key battleground states , the race nationally has been locked in a dead heat for months			1
the debate offers an opportunity for @entity2 or @entity3 to gain some momentum and break the logjam			1
here are five things to watch for on wednesday : 1			0
who 's presidential ? the first and most important test for the president and @entity3 in this opening debate is to act like they belong in the job			1
we 've heard a lot of bickering on the campaign trail , and there 's plenty of talk that zingers could decide who wins or loses the showdown in @entity0			0
but to most @entity33 , this debate is really about which candidate has the composure and stature to serve in the @entity37			0
what they stand for : candidates at a glance " if either the president or @entity3 ca n't pass this test , the rest really do n't matter			1
big ideas from a small person wo n't make you president of the @entity33 , " says @entity4 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity45			2
" when the moment comes , this is like proposing to your wife			0
this is a big moment			0
" thanks to already serving nearly four years in the @entity56 , @entity2 starts with the advantage , but he ca n't afford to play it safe at the debate			1
@entity60 : the debates are all about trust " playing it safe allows @entity3 to dominate the agenda and put @entity2 on defense			1
either you 're on offense or defense , and defense loses , " adds @entity45 , who was a senior adviser to @entity3 in 2008 election			0
by comparison , @entity3 has to do double duty : stay on offense but also look presidential			0
what does @entity2 have to do ? " keep cool -- which comes naturally to him , " says @entity75 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity76			1
" make it about the middle class , not himself or @entity3			0
can @entity3 get @entity83 into the discussion ? the first debate is officially devoted to domestic policy			1
the listed topics , according to the @entity88 , are the economy , health care , the role of government and governing -- whatever that means			2
matters of national security and foreign policy are being left to later debates , but @entity3 may not be content to wait that long with the drip - drip - drip of conflicting news continuing to emerge from @entity83 , where four @entity33 -- including @entity33 ambassador @entity100 -- were killed in an apparent terrorist attack last month			1
serious questions have been raised for the @entity2 administration in the wake of the @entity83 attack : was the @entity33 compound in @entity107 secure before the attack ? did @entity33 officials fail to heed warnings or concerns about possible violence ? why has the president been so hesitant to describe the incident as a " terrorist attack " ? why is the scene still not secure , more than two weeks after the attack ? @entity56 @entity4 wants @entity118 to answer for @entity83 security " we 've seen a confused , slow , inconsistent response to what is now very clearly known as a terrorist act , " @entity4 vice presidential candidate @entity120 said on monday			1
" it 's really indicative of a broader failure of this administration 's foreign policy and the crisis that is taking place across the @entity131			0
" polls indicate that the economy remains the top issue for voters , and @entity3 advisers in @entity137 believe the same			1
and when it comes to foreign policy , more voters trust @entity2 than @entity3 , polls show			1
but there are hints of vulnerability for the president on @entity83 crisis			1
in a recent @entity149 poll , 43 % of voters said they disapproved of @entity2 's performance on @entity83 , while 39 % approved			1
with his campaign scrambling for traction and looking for any opportunity to shrink the trust gap between himself and the president , it wo n't be a shocker if @entity3 brings up the @entity131 turmoil on wednesday night and ties it to a broader critique of the president 's leadership			2
@entity2 , @entity3 only met a few times 3			1
who makes the case on the economy ? in a debate focusing on domestic concerns , the economy is the issue that should dominate the debate			1
the economy remains the top issue on the minds of @entity33 voters and according to a new @entity1 / @entity178 poll , likely voters are split on whether the president or the @entity4 nominee would do a better job fixing the economy over the next four years			1
expect to hear two very different narratives on wednesday night			0
the president will continue to argue that the country 's making progress and that now is not the time to go back to the policies of the @entity188 years that got us into the current mess			2
and he 'll say that now 's not the time to go back to helping the millionaires and @entity193			0
expect a very different narrative from @entity3			2
in his year and a half long bid for the @entity56 , one of the former @entity199 governor 's main arguments is that thanks to his business background , he can do a better job creating jobs than @entity2 has done over the past four years			1
the debate in @entity0 gives @entity3 a well - watched platform to make his case			0
@entity3 : debates are n't about a win @entity3 " has to explain a rationale that he 's offering change that would make things better over the next four years , " says @entity45			0
" this is his opportunity to present his counternarrative , that @entity2 's growing the wrong economy			1
he need say that @entity216 's economy is doing just fine , and ask how your economy 's doing			2
" whichever candidate better presents and sells his economic narrative will go a long way toward determining who wins the debate , and more importantly , who wins the minds of undecided voters			2
can @entity2 get women and @entity230 into the discussion ? @entity3 carved out positions during the @entity4 primaries that have landed him in a deep hole with @entity236 and female voters			1
remember the so - called " war on women " ? in the course of trying to out - conservative his @entity4 rivals , @entity3 vowed to end federal funding for @entity242 , came out against a law that mandates insurance companies cover contraception services and did not take a stand on the @entity247 that @entity2 signed in 2009			2
he has also said he wants the @entity248 to overturn @entity249			0
@entity3 also rankled @entity236 by calling elements of @entity252 's tough immigration law a " model " for the nation , floating the notion of " self - deportation " and promising to veto the @entity255 , which would offer a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants			0
latino vote in @entity262 up for grabs the @entity2 campaign has exploited these positions to great effect , pushing them to women and @entity236 in swing state campaign appearances , targeted e-mails and niche media efforts			2
( do n't know who @entity271 is ? @entity273 her			0
) @entity4 have criticized those tactics as a cynical distraction from the sagging economy , but they 're working			0
a @entity279 poll of @entity281 likely voters released last week , for instance , showed @entity3 losing women to @entity2 by a staggering 25 - point margin			1
@entity285 polling , meanwhile , has him badly trailing @entity2 among @entity236 -- and it 's been that way all year			2
with more than 50 million people expected to tune in wednesday evening , do n't expect the president to pass up a golden opportunity to keep female and @entity236 - oriented issues in the national spotlight			0
in debates , presidential candidates ' tics and tells matter 5			0
taking the zing out of zingers it was just one line in a @entity300 story last weekend about each candidate 's debate cram sessions , but it grabbed a lot of attention			0
" mr. @entity3 's team has concluded that debates are about creating moments and has equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since august , " reporters @entity305 and @entity307 wrote in the paper			0
@entity2 : ' they 're making me do my homework ' romney advisers are correct that voters are likely to walk away from the debate talking about distinctive moments -- audible sighs , body language , repeated use of phrases such as " lock box " -- rather than factoids about @entity328 or sequestration			1
but zingers ? the @entity2 team predictably pounced on that one			2
@entity332 square off before the debate " we also saw in reports that @entity3 and his team have been working on zingers and special lines for months , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity334 told reporters over the weekend			2
" that 's not what the president 's focus is on			0
so if you 're expecting that , that 's probably not what he 's going to deliver on			0
" @entity3 delivered his lines with precision during the @entity4 primary debates and probably will again on wednesday			0
but if it comes to pass that @entity3 jabs at @entity2 with a sharp attack or humorous quip , you can be sure the president 's allies will be ready to mock @entity3 's reliance on prepared " zingers " to diminish his stature and performance			1
new national poll shows close race complete coverage : @entity363 what questions went unanswered ? share your thoughts with @entity367 .			0
