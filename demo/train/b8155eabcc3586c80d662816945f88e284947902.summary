@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 on monday sharply defended his government 's plan to build new housing on disputed land in @entity8 , a decision that has put @entity3 at odds with its leading ally			1
in a defiant speech to the leading @entity14 lobby in the @entity15 , @entity2 said @entity17 neighborhoods in @entity8 are " an integral and inextricable part of modern @entity8			1
" " the connection between the @entity17 people and @entity8 can not be denied , " @entity2 said to prolonged applause			1
" the @entity17 people were building @entity8 3,000 years ago , and the @entity17 people are building @entity8 today			1
@entity8 is not a settlement			0
" @entity2 's monday night speech to the @entity15 - @entity3 @entity29 came nearly two weeks after @entity3 announced the planned construction of 1,600 new housing units in a disputed area claimed by both @entity3 and @entity33			1
that announcement came during @entity15 vice president @entity36 's visit to @entity3 and has strained ties between @entity2 's government and the @entity40 administration , which is pushing for new talks to end the decades - old @entity3 - @entity33 conflict			1
but @entity2 said his government 's policies are in line with those of previous @entity3 administrations , and that nearly half of @entity8 's @entity17 population now lives in @entity8 , which @entity3 has occupied since 1967			1
" everyone -- @entity15 , @entity52 , @entity3 , certainly @entity33 -- everyone knows that these neighborhoods will be part of @entity3 in any peace settlement , " @entity2 said			1
" therefore , building them in no way precludes the possibility of a two - state solution			2
" @entity33 leaders have refused to rejoin peace talks until @entity3 freezes the construction of @entity17 settlements in the @entity64 and @entity8			1
@entity2 said his government has lifted roadblocks and checkpoints in the @entity64 , temporarily halted construction and called on the @entity33 to come back to the negotiating table without delay			2
the prime minister met earlier with @entity15 secretary of state @entity72 , who has called the @entity3 announcement insulting			1
in her own speech to @entity75 , she said the @entity15 commitment to @entity3 's security was rock - solid but added that as " @entity3 's friend , it is our responsibility to give credit when it is due and to tell the truth when it is needed			1
" " our credibility in this process depends in part on our willingness to praise both sides when they are courageous , and when we do n't agree , to say so , and say so unequivocally , " @entity85 said			0
" we objected to this announcement because we are committed to @entity3 and its security , which we believe depends on a comprehensive peace -- because we are determined to keep moving forward along a path that ensures @entity3 's future as a secure and democratic jewish state living in peace with its @entity33 and @entity99 neighbors			0
" the @entity15 is @entity3 's leading ally and provides nearly $ 3 billion a year in aid to the jewish state , about three - quarters of which goes to purchase @entity15 military equipment			2
@entity75 has called on the @entity40 administration to step back from its " public demands and unilateral deadlines directed at @entity3 , " but @entity85 defended the administration 's call for @entity3 to stop building in largely @entity99 @entity8			2
@entity2 met with @entity85 for close to two hours monday afternoon , a senior @entity109 official and an @entity3 official said			2
most of the session was one - on - one between @entity85 and @entity2 , though @entity3 defense minister @entity114 joined the talks at the end , the officials said			2
@entity2 had dinner with @entity36 on monday evening and will meet with president @entity40 at the @entity119 on tuesday , the prime minister 's office said			0
@entity85 focused much of her speech to @entity75 on the threat presented by @entity122 , telling her audience that " elements in @entity122 's government have become a menace , both to their own people and in the region			0
" " the @entity15 is determined to prevent @entity122 from acquiring nuclear weapons , " she vowed			0
" our aim is not incremental sanctions , but sanctions that will bite			0
it is taking time to produce these sanctions , and we believe that time is a worthwhile investment for winning the broadest possible support for our efforts			0
" and @entity2 reiterated his government 's hard line regarding @entity122 , which has refused international demands to halt its production of nuclear fuel			0
he called the threat of an @entity122 nuclear weapon a threat not only to @entity3 , but " a grave threat to the region and to the world			0
" he received another prolonged ovation when he declared that @entity3 , which is widely believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , " must always reserve the right to defend itself			0
" @entity1 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity2 tells @entity3 lobby that @entity17 building in @entity8 will continue
commitment to @entity3 " *unwavering* , enduring and forever , " @entity72 says
secretary of state says @entity15 will also continue to rebuke @entity3 when necessary
construction plans in @entity8 has strained @entity15 - @entity3 ties
