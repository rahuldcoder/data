-- five - time champion @entity1 survived an early injury scare to cruise into the second round of the @entity5 on tuesday			1
the @entity7 third seed rolled her ankle when 4 - 0 up in the opening set of her match with @entity13 's @entity12 , but retained her composure to seal an emphatic 6 - 0 6 - 0 " double bagel " triumph			1
" i have n't had enough time to assess it yet , " the 15 - time grand slam champion told reporters after arriving at her press conference on crutches			2
" i saw the doctor again -- we 're just going to see how it is in a few hours from now			0
" but i 'll be out there on thursday -- i mean , unless something fatal happens to me -- there 's no way i 'm not going to be out there competing			2
" @entity1 ' second - round opponent will be @entity33 , who survived a marathon third set against @entity36 's @entity35 to seal a 4 - 6 6 - 1 14 - 12 win			1
the 31 - year - old also injured her ankle last year , at the @entity41 warmup tournament , and then lost in the fourth round in @entity43			1
" it reminded me a lot of @entity41			0
i thought , ' oh , not again			0
' but , you know , i 've had such a good year that i do n't think it 's anything negative , " she said			2
" i 've been injured before			0
i 've played this tournament with so many injuries and was able to come out on top			0
" so for me , it 's just another page , and a great story to tell the grandkids one day			2
" top seed @entity55 also advanced at the expense of a @entity13 , recovering from 0 - 3 down in the second set to beat the unseeded @entity59 6 - 1 6 - 4			1
" her game is definitely unusual , but i 've known her since we played under 14s , and she actually played a lot more spin back then -- it was all slice from both sides before , " said the defending champion , who will next play @entity62 's @entity61			1
" @entity59 's unusual and tries to make you feel a little bit miserable on the court , like you do n't know what to do , because every ball comes from different angles			1
so it 's important to just keep your focus and execute your shots			2
" two grand slam champions went head - to - head in the @entity79 , with 2011 @entity80 winner @entity78 edging past @entity82 's @entity81 -- who clinched the 2010 @entity85 title			2

" playing at this age is really nothing , " explained date - @entity94			0
" i eat a lot , i sleep a lot -- last night i was in the bed before 10 p.m. i finished dinner at 7:30 already , then sleep before 10 like the kids ! " because after practice or after matches i 'm always tired , so i just need to recover more			0
it 's a simple life			0
" of course i 'm very happy to win today , but i do n't play for records			0
even if i lose , i still enjoy it			0
" @entity82 seventh seed @entity118 also fell at the first hurdle			0
the 2011 @entity85 finalist lost 6 - 4 6 - 4 to @entity123 's @entity122			1
in the men 's draw , four - time champion @entity124 cruised through his opener against @entity130 's world no. 46 @entity128 , winning 6 - 2 6 - 4 6 - 1 in just 83 minutes			1
the second seed paid tribute to @entity134 chief @entity133 following tuesday 's news that he will stand down as head of men 's tennis after being diagnosed with the motor - neurone disease			1
" i saw him yesterday and he told me the news			0
i 've known @entity133 ever since i came on tour ... i call him a friend , " said @entity124 , who is looking for an @entity5 era - record fifth win in @entity43			1
the @entity144 , a former tennis pro , has played a key part in expanding the men 's game into @entity149 , taking the season - ending championships to @entity151 before it switched to @entity152 in 2009			1
" he was so influential			0
he goes so far back and has touched so many people throughout his career as a player and then also as an executive and then ceo , " @entity124 said			2
" it 's been very hard to see him not doing so well , so we wish him the best			0
i worked with him very closely , especially the last few years now , and he deserved to be ceo and chairman			0
" @entity124 will play fellow 31 - year - old @entity162 in round two after @entity98 's world no. 40 defeated @entity166 's @entity165			1
@entity168 champion @entity167 began his bid for a third final appearance in four years at the @entity43 grand slam with a comfortable 6 - 3 6 - 1 6 - 3 win against @entity174 @entity173			1
@entity173 saved two match points , but world @entity176 -- beaten by @entity124 in the 2010 final and @entity177 last year -- shrugged off any suggestion nerves were negatively impacting his game			2
" if you are n't nervous , it shows that you 're really not that bothered , " said the 25 - year - old @entity167 after setting up a meeting with @entity182 's @entity181			1
" when the nerves are there , sometimes it can be for 10 , 15 minutes before you go on the court or the beginning of the match or the evening beforehand			0
they can affect you at different times			0
" but it shows that you care , and that 's the positive you take out of it			0
often when you are nervous , you can play your best tennis			0
" fifth seed @entity196 advanced at the expense of fellow @entity130 @entity199 , sealing a 6 - 4 7 - 5 6 - 2 success			1
