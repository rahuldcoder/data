-- a federal appeals court decided tuesday to continue the stay of a judge 's ruling that struck down @entity6 's same - sex marriage ban , meaning that gay and lesbian couples can not marry in the state while the appeals process unfolds			1
@entity12 district judge @entity11 issued an order friday that invalidated a state constitutional amendment restricting marriage to between one man and one woman because , in his view , it violated the @entity12 @entity20			2
his ruling set the stage for same - sex couples to marry immediately			1
and scores of them did saturday until the 6th @entity12 @entity26 -- after a request filed by @entity6 attorney general @entity28 -- issued an order to temporarily stay , or put on hold , @entity11 's decision through at least wednesday			1
the same federal court decided to act even sooner than that with its decision tuesday			0
it cited an apparently unanimous @entity37 order from january regarding a similar case in @entity39			0
@entity39 had asked the high court to intervene last week after 10th @entity12 @entity26 declined to stay a lower court ruling in december striking down @entity39 's voter - approved prohibition of legal wedlock for gays and lesbians			2
two 6th circuit appeals judges signed onto tuesday 's decision , making it binding , while one -- judge @entity48 -- dissented			2
@entity48 said that while the @entity37 did act regarding @entity39 , " it did so without a statement of reasons , and therefore the order provides little guidance			0
" voters in @entity39 , @entity6 and nine other states passed constitutional amendments in 2004 defining marriage as one man and one woman			2
whether same - sex couples should be allowed to wed was a hot - button issue then and in subsequent years , with polls showing that most @entity12 favored restrictions			1
but public opinion shifted over time			0
an @entity67 / @entity66 survey released earlier this month found that 59 % of @entity12 favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. the courts have stepped in as well , most notably the @entity37 's landmark decision last june rejecting parts of the @entity73 while ruling same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			1
@entity11 's ruling was the latest in a series of recent similar decisions affecting marriage restrictions in states including @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
in most all those cases , the judge 's orders did not take effect immediately			0
but @entity6 's did and , as in @entity39 , scores of same - sex couples sought and got marriage licenses before later court decisions halted such unions -- at least for now , as higher courts weigh in			1
in @entity99 , @entity6 , for example , 57 gay and lesbian couples got licenses , according to county clerk @entity101			2
their legal status in @entity6 , in the wake of the various court rulings , was in limbo until wednesday			0
in a statement , gov. @entity106 said these same - sex couples had been " legally married			1
" but that does not mean that they 'll be afforded the same benefits as married heterosexual couples in the state , at least for the time being			0
" because the stay brings @entity6 law on this back into effect , the rights tied to these marriages are suspended until the stay is lifted or judge @entity11 's decision is upheld on appeal , " @entity106 said , referring to the state 's ban on gay marriages			1
couples marry before court halts licenses			0

new : *governor* : rights tied to gay marriages that took place are " suspended "
a judge had struck down @entity6 's same - sex marriage ban
scores of couples married before an appeals court issued a temporary stay
that same appeals court continues its stay , meaning no more gay marriages -- for now
