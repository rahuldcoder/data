opposition activists say the overall toll is more than 9,000 , most of them civilians			0

a @entity4 rebel leader vehemently refuted the government 's claim that so - called " terrorists " -- not the regime itself -- were behind the @entity17 blasts			1
" this is the regime 's game			0
this is how they play their dirty tricks			0
they carry out these types of explosions from time to time to get more international support and compassion , " capt. @entity117 of the rebel @entity32 said sunday			0

and it 's not just deaths			0
opposition activists also described what happened to 32 surviving children and two women after an attack last week in the @entity174 district of @entity149 province			0

most reports from inside @entity4 indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking @entity207 's ouster			2
the @entity208 has ruled @entity4 for more than four decades			0
but @entity207 's regime has insisted that " armed terrorist groups " are behind the violence and says it has popular support for its actions			0
