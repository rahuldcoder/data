-- just how bad is the civil unrest associated with the occupy protests in some @entity4 cities ? this bad : there is an online petition calling on @entity9 gov. @entity8 to send the @entity10 to protect @entity12 protesters from the city 's police department			1
in recent weeks , hundreds of protesters in @entity15 have clashed with police officers in riot gear			1
in one tragic incident , a 24 - year - old @entity19 war veteran named @entity21 was critically injured when he was hit in the head by a teargas canister at close range			0
even compared to the @entity26 demonstrations and other protests around the country , what 's happening in @entity15 shocks the senses			1
judging from video and firsthand accounts , the police in that city have been especially brutal in dealing with the protesters			0
just two decades ago , in the 1990s , the favored law - enforcement approach was community policing : the idea that police were most effective when they were intertwined with the community			1
this is a throwback to an earlier time , when a cop walked a beat , knew the neighborhoods and made sure doors were locked after dark			1
now , in some cases , instead of the police serving the community , it 's more like the police are at war with the community			1
how did we get here , in @entity15 and elsewhere ? and how do we go back ? i have a friend who thinks he knows what went wrong			1
he 's a cop who has been on the force more than 25 years , having worked himself into the upper management ranks of a midsized police department near @entity62			1
i 'm comfortable in that world			0
my father is a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job			1
i grew up around cops			1
and now , some of my good friends are cops			2
i often say that while i cover politicians for a living , i 'd rather spend the day with police			0
yet my relationship with the institution of law enforcement is also complicated			0
my upbringing does n't prevent me from -- in the course of doing my job -- criticizing police officers or law enforcement agencies when they turn into bullies , betray the public trust or deny a suspect due process			1
i 'm also highly critical of the tendency of some police officers to dabble in areas of law enforcement they do n't understand , such as federal immigration law			2
the siege in @entity15 , where police have repeatedly clashed with protesters , reminds us that there 's one other thing that police officers should n't do : impersonate soldiers			1
that 's what concerns my friend , who agreed to talk with me on the condition of anonymity , given the sensitive nature of the subject			2
like many law enforcement officers , he was in the military			2
but after he was discharged he began a career in civilian law enforcement			0
he knows the difference between the job that he used to have and the one he has now			2
but , he fears , that may not be true for a lot of cops on patrol these days			2
the way my friend sees it , our police forces have become militarized			0
" the mission has n't changed , " he said , " and that 's to make people feel safe in their communities			2
it 's how we go about doing it that has changed			2
" these are miniature armies , stocked with every weapon imaginable -- all at the officer 's disposal			2
" you make adjustments here and there , " he said , " the next thing you know , there are machine guns in the squad cars			1
and not in a weapons locker back at the station house			2
in many cities , the machine guns are in the police cars , next to the standard issue shotgun			1
on the officer 's belt : a @entity150 , .40 caliber handgun with 16 bullets in the clip and one in the chamber , a baton and mace			0
and that 's for one officer			0
multiply it out , and you 'll get an idea of how much firepower is circulating out on the street			0
there is more on the way			0
leaf through a police magazine these days and you 'll see ads for automatic weapons , military equipment and the like -- all being pitched at police officers			1
midsized and larger police departments have long had @entity169 teams			0
but now , even patrol officers have access to more firepower than they used to			0
the must - have item this holiday season : an armored assault vehicle			0
a tank , which will be back at the station house if you need it			0
" there 's a sense among new recruits that police work is about soldiering , " my friend lamented			1
" and we do n't discourage it			0
in fact , we encourage it -- when ( in reality ) about 90 % of what we do is community relations			0
law enforcement is n't about kicking down doors			1
it 's about building and maintaining relationships			1
police officers have the power to either make their job simpler or more difficult			1
if they treat people well and build relations , people will cooperate			0
they 'll have leads , witnesses and informants			0
but if they see the people they 're supposed to " protect and serve " the way an occupying army sees the native population , they 're going to encounter resistance , suspicion , defiance and other things that make their job harder			0
that 's a recipe for chaos			0
meanwhile , these mini-armies are always on the lookout for the next battle			0
and , as events in @entity15 and around the country suggest , they usually find it			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

@entity227 : occupy @entity15 protests showed cops in violent clash with citizens
he says *increasingly* cops everywhere trading community policing for more weapons
he says officers in some cities have machine guns in cars , see job as soldiering
@entity227 : policing not about kicking down doors , it 's about building relationships .
