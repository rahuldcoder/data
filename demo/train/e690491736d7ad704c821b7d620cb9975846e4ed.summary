@entity0 , @entity1 -- the term of service for the president should be extended from its current four years -- renewable once -- to a single term of " a little more than four years , " @entity1 president @entity3 said tuesday in a statement			1
he said he will send a bill to @entity11 to pass the changes to the constitution that would set the parameters he is seeking			2
it will be his first bill since he took the reins of power in april			2
@entity3 insisted he would not benefit from the change , since it would not go into effect until the next election , in 2015			1
but it was not clear that he was being sincere			0
several presidential sources told @entity2 that @entity3 is pushing for a six - or seven - year term			1
and , though he implied this year during a speech in @entity27 that he would not run again in 2015 , @entity3 has never made such a statement publicly in @entity1			1
the last elections , in april , were among the most violent in the country 's history and influential elements ( particularly from the predominantly @entity34 north of the country who feel it is their turn to have the presidency ) staunchly oppose his extending his hold on power			0
april 's elections pitted residents of the country 's north against those of the ( predominantly @entity48 ) south , where @entity3 is from			1
since then , violence in the north has escalated -- much of it attributed to the @entity53 militant group @entity52 and almost daily attacks in the northeastern city of @entity56			0
such violence could escalate still further , as could attacks in the capital city of @entity60 , where many residents resent what they consider to have been @entity3 's hijacking of the election from the north			1
though @entity3 took power in may , his hold on it remains tenuous : he has yet to form a complete cabinet ; has failed to push through passage of a major petroleum bill ; and has failed to quell violence in the north			2
public expectation is for him to encourage economic growth and investment , as well as private reforms in the power sector -- the two main issues of his campaign platform			0
it would be difficult to focus on these two major areas if the start of his presidency is focused on such a controversial bill			0
the length of the presidential term has been a hot - button issue for years			1
@entity3 's predecessor , @entity88 , attempted to run for a third term before his constitutionally approved two - term limit expired in 2007			1
that bid failed in the face of opposition from the north			0
@entity3 's bill could be seen as a " rebranding " of @entity88 's attempt to push third - term bill			1
in his envisaged bill , the tenure of members of the @entity102 assemblies would also be extended to a little more than four years , though lawmakers would be eligible for re-election			0
@entity3 said his commitment to a single term for the president and governors was a reflection of his belief that a longer term would help stabilize society and strengthen democracy			1
it would minimize the acrimony and unrest that quadrennial elections generate at the federal and state levels , he said , adding that it would also save the government the expense of conducting party primaries and general elections every four years			0
" the proposed amendment bill is necessary to consolidate our democracy and allow elected executives to concentrate on governance and service delivery for their full term , instead of running governments with re-election as their primary focus , " he said			2
@entity3 noted that " certain reports in a section of the media " had interpreted his move as an attempt to lengthen his hold on power			2
but , he added , " nothing can be more untrue			0
the energy that has been devoted to speculations on the content of the likely bill is akin to an attempt to force the abortion of a nonexistent pregnancy			0
the details of the bill will be clear in terms of its provisions when it is forwarded to the @entity11 for consideration			0

@entity3 wants to extend *slightly* the current 4 - year presidential term
several presidential sources say he is pushing for a 6 - year to 7 - year term
he has said he would not benefit from such a change
