-- as the violence in @entity2 appears to be escalating , @entity3 and @entity4 are pushing for a @entity6 resolution condemning attacks on protesters and calling for humanitarian access			1
the resolution makes no mention of the kind of sanctions or military intervention seen in @entity14 , raising questions about what outcome the international community sees for @entity2			1
are you in @entity2 ? share your photos and videos from the scene , but please stay safe			1
here @entity0 correspondent @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 at the @entity25 in @entity26 outline what is happening both in and outside @entity2 , as efforts to resolve the crisis continue			1
what are the protesters demanding ? @entity22 : initially protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law			2
some of these reforms have , on paper , been implemented by president @entity40 , but it was far too little and , by the time it came about , too late			2
the protests started in reaction to the arrest of schoolchildren in the town of @entity48 for painting anti-government graffiti and snowballed into what we 're seeing now			0
it appears that the bloodier the violence that is used against the demonstrators , the more galvanized and hardened they have become until they are now calling for the downfall of @entity40 's regime			2
the ideal scenario for the protesters would be a @entity2 free from the claws of the @entity40 regime , true democratic elections and an end to the secret service apparatus which pervades all levels of life in @entity2			1
has @entity40 made any genuine attempts to meet the demands of protesters ? @entity22 : it would appear not			1
he did lift the state of emergency , which was a big deal because it has been in place for nearly half a century , and he abolished a court set up to trying people posing a threat to the regime , but at the same time arbitrary detentions have continued , as has the use of force against demonstrators			0
so although you could argue that he lifted measures in place for decades , nothing has changed			0
is it possible that @entity40 could still ride it out ? are there any hopes for reconciliation ? @entity22 : a lot of people i 'm talking to say @entity40 's political career will not survive the uprising			1
but the question is whether he will be replaced in the short or long term			0
he could still hold on for an incredibly long time			0
i think there is a slight chance he could stay on , but that could mean widespread and unimaginable bloodshed because he would need to silence every single opposing voice			2
also , importantly , there is no united international voice against @entity2 to impose the kind of pressure applied on @entity14			2
does the violence in @entity2 still appear to be escalating ? @entity22 : it fluctuates			1
some days are incredibly bloody while others , less so			0
the military seems to concentrate on one area at a time			0
first we saw @entity116 and the coastal areas , then @entity48 , then we saw the area on the border with @entity120 , then villages near the town of @entity123 and now we 're seeing the focus on the northwest			0
but in general , there does seem to be an increase in violence			0
is it likely the army will launch an all - out assault to crush the uprising ? @entity22 : it would be difficult , given the troop numbers we believe are available for an operation to take place simultaneously countrywide			2
but that does n't rule out other measures , such as the use of fighter jets			0
there are certainly fears from some in @entity2 that there will be a repeat of the 1982 @entity147 by @entity2 's military -- acting under orders from @entity40 's father , @entity150 -- in which thousands of civilians are believed to have perished			1
many activists are already comparing what is happening right now to @entity154 , but in slow motion rather than a single , devastating strike			0
the opposition activists say what we are seeing now is more systematic , sustained slaughter			0
is there any evidence that senior officers are defecting ? could this be significant ? @entity22 : there are reports but nothing concrete			2
there are a few @entity169 videos claiming defections and a few people have been turning up in @entity120 , and in @entity173 we are hearing , but i 'm not seeing the kind of widespread defections it would take for the security apparatus to break down			1
it would take a major defection to have any effect because there would still be units loyal to @entity40 's regime			2
his brother , for example , is the head of the feared @entity188 and @entity189			0
@entity2 's military has n't taken a sideline role like in @entity192 or @entity193 , which means if the regime falls the security apparatus is likely to crumble as well because the people are n't likely to accept a military accused of massacring civilians to rule the country in the interim			1
is social media still playing a part in the uprising ? is it likely to have a decisive role in the final outcome ? @entity22 : it 's huge			1
it 's not the same as we saw in @entity192 , which has been labeled a @entity211 revolution because of the role of social networking sites			0
@entity2 is the @entity169 revolution			1
if activists were n't posting videos to @entity169 , we would have almost no window into what appears to be happening in @entity2			1
will it be decisive ? yes , absolutely			0
the reason why people have been able to have such a strong debate about crimes against humanity , about abuses , about the atrocities allegedly committed is because we 've had these images on hand			0
who are @entity40 's main regional allies ? what effect is the @entity2 crisis likely to have on them ? @entity22 : @entity234 and @entity235 are key players , particularly when it comes to exerting influence in the @entity25			1
@entity173 was a friend but now their relationship has cooled			0
@entity242 , however , is a huge ally			0
@entity120 is terrified about the outcome of crisis because anything to do with @entity2 tends to have a polarizing effect on @entity120 , largely because it acts as a geographical link between @entity242 and the @entity250 leadership in @entity120 and the border with @entity242 's ideological enemy @entity253			2
why is there no likelihood of @entity25 sanctions or military action against @entity2 ? @entity24 : the @entity6 tends to build its approach on an incremental basis when faced with a country or issue that splits opinion			1
due to history , location , politics and power , @entity2 has more allies than @entity14 at this time and so is unlikely to face similar @entity25 - mandated action			1
@entity234 and @entity235 usually feel that it is not the @entity6 's role to get involved in what they say is a matter for the internal affairs of @entity25 member countries			1
that said , they may eventually budge to at least join the @entity6 in expressing concern or condemnation of what is happening in @entity2			0
but it will take more displays of @entity2 brutality for @entity234 and @entity235 to go along with sanctions			0
@entity2 's key role in the @entity288 peace process also makes military attacks extremely unlikely at this point too .			1

@entity22 : slim chance @entity40 could cling to power but at cost of heavy bloodshed
@entity297 : @entity169 videos playing a key role in opposition movement
@entity24 : @entity2 's key role in @entity288 peace process likely to rule out @entity25 - sanctioned military action
