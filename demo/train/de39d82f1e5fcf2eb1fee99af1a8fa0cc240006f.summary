i ca n't believe i 'm writing this , but : @entity4 , you 've got a heck of a lot to learn from @entity7			1
not in terms of per capita income , obesity rates or lgbt rights			2
it 's well - known that @entity7 falls at or near the bottom of 50 - state rankings for a range of social and health indicators			1
but there 's at least one stat where the @entity7 shines : its vaccination rate			1
a staggering 99.7 % of kindergartners in @entity7 are vaccinated for measles , according to the @entity22			1
that 's the highest rate in the nation			2
in @entity4 , the rate is only 92.3 %			1
( @entity26 , meanwhile , has the lowest rate , at 81.7 %			2
) those numbers are significant			2
even a very small percentage of unvaccinated kids can contribute to an outbreak , especially if they 're concentrated in a single community , as is often the case in high - end , hippy - dippy @entity4			1
according to the @entity35 , 87 % of kindergartners at the @entity37 , for example , had exemptions from vaccination			1
parents at the school " seek more alternative health care , " a spokeswoman told that newspaper			2
well , they 're choosing an unsafe alternative -- one that puts their kids , and , importantly , all kids in the community , at greater risk			2
they should n't be allowed to do so			2
those risks should be abundantly clear given the outbreak of measles that started at @entity56			0
from january 1 to january 30 , there were 102 cases of measles reported across 14 states			0
it 's time for @entity4 's gov. @entity62 to stand up to the so - called anti-vaxxer crowd			1
he has a moral responsibility to push for vaccine policies that are more like @entity7 's			1
it 's clear , after all , that policies are what make the difference			0
parents in @entity4 can exempt their children from life - saving vaccines because of philosophical or religious reasons			1
more - religious @entity7 , meanwhile , offers neither			1
it 's one of only two states -- the other is @entity77 , with a 96.1 % measles vaccination rate -- that requires parents to vaccinate their children unless they have a medical reason not to			0
the result : it 's easy for misinformed parents to skip vaccinations in @entity4			1
in @entity7 , it 's hard			1
i 'm not a scientist , but i do trust scientists			0
and if you listen to them , you know that higher vaccination rates make kids safer			0
as @entity0 's dr. @entity94 has reported , vaccines do not pose a danger to children			0
they do not cause autism			0
sure , there is always a slight risk of an allergic reaction or other complication			0
but the risk of serious allergic reaction to the measles vaccine , according to the @entity22 , is less in 1 in a million			1
@entity94 smartly puts that in context : " it is worth pointing out that 12 out of 10,000 people who take an aspirin are at risk of intracerebral hemorrhage , or bleeding in the brain			0
people who regularly take too much acetaminophen ( @entity115 ) are the largest group of people hospitalized for acute liver failure			0
and , on average , one person in the @entity120 dies every year from @entity122 intoxication , or drinking too much water			0
and yet , no armies have formed against aspirin , @entity115 or water			0
" all 50 states offer the medical exemption , according to the @entity129			2
some children , such as those with cancer , can not be safely vaccinated			0
but 48 of them offer religious exemptions			1
and 20 states -- @entity4 among them -- grant " philosophical exemptions for those who object to immunizations because of personal , moral or other beliefs , " @entity129 says			1
these laws cave to the anti-science , anti-vaccine movement			2
and they create unnecessary public health risks			0
in @entity4 , it 's relatively easy for parents to obtain exemptions based on their personal beliefs			1
" legislators tried in 2012 to make it tougher for parents to bypass vaccines , requiring counseling and signatures from health care professionals to gain an exemption , " the @entity35 reports			2
" but two loopholes left it easy for parents to opt out : counseling can be given by naturopaths , who practice alternative medicine and typically oppose vaccination			0
( and ) people who oppose vaccination because of religious beliefs can skip counseling , a policy change that ( @entity4 ) governor @entity62 instituted when he signed the updated law			1
" in an e-mail , @entity62 's press secretary , @entity173 , told me that " the governor believes that vaccinations are profoundly important and a major public health benefit			0
" he cited data showing the kindergarten immunization rate for measles is up very slightly ( from 92.3 % to 92.6 % ) in the wake of the 2012 law			0
and " personal belief exemptions " are down from 3.15 % to 2.54 %			1
" it clearly has had an impact on exemptions in terms of providing parents with more information , " @entity173 said of the 2012 law			2
it 's also clearly not enough			0
two lawmakers in @entity4 are proposing legislation that would limit parents ' ability to claim " personal belief " exemptions from shots , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity198			1
it 's unclear if the bill would eliminate religious exemptions , as well , according to that network			1
and i hope the bill will be the subject of much debate			0
for now , however , personal choice and fear are trumping reason in @entity4			1
" it 's good to explore alternatives rather than go with the panic of everyone around you , " a @entity4 parent told @entity212			1
" vaccines do n't feel right for me and my family			0
" it does n't matter what " feels right			0
" it matters what 's real			0
vaccines do n't cause autism			0
and allowing parents to act on such misguided " beliefs " is negligent			2
@entity4 needs to take a cue from @entity7 and remove its vaccine exemptions .			1

@entity233 : @entity4 should boost its vaccine laws
the state offers exemptions for religious and personal beliefs
@entity233 points to @entity7 as a better example ; that state offers neither exemption
