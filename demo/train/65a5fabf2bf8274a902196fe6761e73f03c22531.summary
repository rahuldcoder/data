@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 remembers facing her assailant at his sentencing			1
" @entity11 eyes , " she said of @entity6 , who shot the former @entity1 congresswoman in the head with a 9mm glock pistol			1
six people died and 13 were injured that day when the deranged gunman opened fire in front of a @entity0 supermarket			2
at the sentencing last november , @entity3 sat stoically -- staring @entity6 down -- as her husband , @entity18 , spoke to the court			1
" well , yes , he had some interesting expressions on his face , " said @entity18			2
" and she did not look away			2
" " @entity11 eyes , " @entity3 repeated			1
in an exclusive , wide - ranging interview with @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity18 understand they are now in the center of the heated debate over gun control and background checks , while still struggling to rebuild their lives after that day in january 2011 , when their lives changed forever			1
old self , new challenges what is most shocking about @entity3 now is how much she looks like her old self			1
her golden locks are back ; so is the sparkle in her eyes and her broad smile			2
gone is the short hair and thin frame we saw at the beginning of her recovery			2
yet she knows she will never be the same			2
stronger , better , tougher			2
stronger , better , tougher			2
" that 's how @entity3 describes herself			1
@entity3 makes that declaration with determination and gusto			1
but it still takes a considerable amount of energy and concentration to articulate that , or anything else			2
' yes , it 's tough ' : for @entity3 , a wounded life has a new purpose being with @entity3 , it is obvious that she understands and absorbs everything around her			1
she follows conversation , reacts , engages and offers unsolicited ideas -- usually in the form of a single word or gesture that makes clear what she means			2
as a result of her gunshot wound , @entity3 suffers from a condition called aphasia , and that it is " very difficult for her , " said @entity18			1
aphasia is an impairment to language - related functions , such as speaking , writing , listening and reading			2
at times , even simple words are a struggle , like when she tries to explain how she spends her days			0
" occupational therapy , yogurt , " said @entity3			1
@entity18 , a former astronaut , patiently and quietly corrects her , saying " yoga			0
" " yoga , yoga , " @entity3 repeats , offering a playful smile to signal she gets how funny it was that she said " yogurt " instead of " yoga			1
" @entity3 and @entity18 : the new ' @entity92 ' of gun control the right - handed @entity3 still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed			1
she generally wears a sling to keep it from flopping around			0
her right leg is also paralyzed			2
she wears a large brace and literally drags her right leg with her good , left leg to walk			0
still , she walks remarkably well			0
but she does n't see very well			0
" not great at all , " is how she described her vision			0
@entity3 has limited sight in both eyes with no peripheral vision to the right			1
in the same house as a family for @entity18 and @entity3 , this is the new normal -- a life together that neither could have ever imagined when they first got together			1
she was a bright young political rising star and he was with @entity110			0
@entity18 said it is " different in a lot of good ways			0
" the biggest difference ? for the first time , they actually live in the same house , in the same city , in the same state			0
before @entity3 was shot , she jetted between her home in @entity0 and work in @entity123 , while @entity18 lived and worked in @entity124 , home of @entity125			1
they had a commuter marriage , which did n't allow them much time together			0
now , they are together all the time , living in a ranch - style home they bought last summer			0
another difference ? before @entity3 was shot , she had a rocky relationship with @entity18 's two teenage daughters from a previous marriage			1
" yes , changed , " says @entity3			1
" yes , a lot better , " echoes @entity18			0
" they 've , well , they 've also grown up a little bit , too			0
and , you know , as a family , we 've evolved because of ... you know , because of what happened , " said @entity18			0
" so it 's brought us all closer together , " said @entity18			0
and , as parents , for @entity3 and @entity18 , thoughts return to her shooter , @entity6			1
mentally ill , " @entity3 added			1
newly - released court documents reveal that @entity6 's parents suspected something was wrong - that he heard voices and exhibited other alarming behavior			1
" as a parent , you know you can empathize with somebody who went thru that ... where their kid did this horrific thing			0
at the same time , you know , there were indications of his mental illness			0
you know , the school knew about it			0
his parents knew about it			0
and he did n't have -- did n't seem to have a lot of options for good treatment , " said @entity18			0
in the past two years , @entity3 and @entity18 have not heard from @entity6 's parents			1
would they want to ? " um , not really , " said @entity3			1
@entity3 suffered yet another tragedy a few months ago			1
her father @entity183 -- with whom she had a special bond -- died suddenly			0
he taught her a lot about humor , strength and responsibility , handing her the keys to his tire business when she was just 26			0
@entity3 ' grit and determination also comes from her mother , @entity193 -- a force of nature			1
she is an artist whose home is in the middle of the desert , miles from civilization			0
off - roading with @entity3 you have to go off - road to get there			1
there are so many desert rocks that on the way home , @entity18 got a flat tire in the pitch black night			0
@entity3 , the daughter of a tire salesman and expert tire changer in her own right , got out of the car to help			1
@entity3 bond with mother , who sat by her hospital bed for countless hours and still plays a central role in her long road to recovery , is tighter than ever			1
and there may be a sliver of hope for @entity3 , now 42 , to have a child of her own			1
when she was shot , she was trying to get pregnant with fertility treatments			2
they still have two frozen embryos			0
but given @entity3 injuries , they 'd likely have to use a surrogate			1
" i do n't know , " said @entity3 , looking over at @entity18 for his response			2
" we -- you know , we talk about it			0
we have n't made a decision , " said @entity18			0
asked whether she is ever resentful about what happened to her , @entity3 replied : " no. no. " " move ahead			2
move ahead , " she said			0
@entity2 's @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
