-- after @entity2 launched a @entity4 campaign to finance the @entity6 movie , the @entity1 went crazy			1
the $ 2 million goal was reached in less than a day , more incentives were added for new backers , and the fund continues to grow			2
@entity0 's @entity11 — who also broke the news — sat down with @entity2 , the creator of the cult tv show , to discuss the movie , the implications of using @entity4 and much more about the @entity6 universe			1
here are 10 things we learned : @entity2 is up for a @entity6 book series : " i will admit it			1
i 'm probably not interested in sitting down and writing a series of @entity6 detective paperbacks , but i could be the @entity23 of @entity6 and okay outlines and kind of set up the world for the books to exist in and then bring in writers to do ' em. i 'm totally game for that			1
i would love to see this franchise get some heat and get its due			2
" he 's genuinely surprised by the reaction : " i never expected to hit $ 2 million in however many hours we did — 10 ? but i probably had similar thoughts to you , that we 'd hit our goal at maybe a week or two and then beyond that , i would hope we would keep climbing			2
yeah , the tidal wave , i was not prepared for at all			2
" @entity0 : ' @entity6 ' movie is a go he has a magic number in mind for the @entity4 fund : " what i had my heart set on when we 've launched , what i hoped to get to , was $ 5 million			1
and i figure anything over $ 5 million , i 'm pretty damn happy			2
anything under $ 5 million , i was going to be less happy			2
that was like my mental happiness point			2
" the money raised wo n't all go toward making the movie : " we only get to count the money that we have after we fulfill rewards , and the rewards could be expensive because we are giving really good packages , so we 're losing a lot off the top			1
it 's not as though you can look at our total , like right now we 're at $ 3.5 [ million ] , and say , " that 's , $ 3.5 for their production budget			2
" [ ed. note : at publishing time , the fund sits at just over $ 3.7 million			0
] it 's going got be significantly less than that once we send out 50,000 t - shirts and all those dvds and posters and pay to rent the giant theaters for premieres			0
there 's a lot of overhead			0
" @entity0 : is the ' @entity6 ' movie a good thing ? @entity83 might have to stand in for @entity84 : " what 's going to affect our production budget is the money we raise on @entity4 , minus the fulfillment , and that 's going to affect very specific things			1
like , if the money stopped now , i know that we would probably be faking @entity84 , @entity94 , probably somewhere like @entity83 , @entity95 , and it wo n't quite look right			1
we 'll do our best to make @entity83 look like @entity96 , but it wo n't be quite the same			0
we 're going to need to make some more money			1
shooting in @entity96 is more expensive than shooting in @entity95 , and i want to shoot in @entity96 — the movie will look better			0
the thing is , we 're totally prepared to shoot it somewhere else , but man , suddenly i 'll have palm trees in shots and @entity6 will be walking along a sandy beach and it will affect the way the movie looks			1
" they are n't doing this to get paid : " for doing the movie , i am taking the guild - minimum			0
so no one is getting big upfront money			1
trust me , @entity115 is not getting paid close to her quote , or anywhere near			0
we 're all working for labor of love prices			0
" only he and @entity115 are signed so far : " i want [ all the actors ] in the movie			0
the assumption is they 'll all be in the movie			0
we 're in negotiations with everyone			0
it 's one of those things where everybody wants to do it , i want everybody in it — just deals need to be made			0
" he really wants @entity136 to follow @entity6 's lead : " if they wanted to @entity4 a @entity136 movie , i would be first in line			1
i want the maximum package			0
i would pay whatever it took to get a @entity136 movie , because i love that show			1
" @entity0 : 25 child stars who made it \ he 's aware of the criticisms about @entity4 funding a studio - backed film : " i 'm watching a lot of the buzz on this , and it seems to me that the people who complain the most , and the complaint is , ' why am i giving money to a studio to make a movie ? ' as though there 's no return on that money			1
i think that before people look at it , their sense is , ' hey , i 'm just throwing money at something			2
' they 're not understanding that they 're getting a product in return			0
that 's where the disconnect is			0
those people who are complaining about that , i want to say , ' if you 're a @entity6 fan , you 're getting cool stuff			1
' you 're getting stuff i think you would pay for anyway ; you 're just pre-buying it , and by pre-buying it , you 're showing the studio that there is enough market interested in making this movie worthwhile			0
" he has high standards for his movie : " who thinks we 'd be better off without @entity187 , which by the way , is the bar that i 'm setting for the @entity6 movie			1
