-- @entity2 's painful struggle with racism has often brought great satisfaction to the country 's rivals , critics , and foes			1
the killing of @entity10 by a police officer in @entity12 , @entity13 , and its tumultuous aftermath has been a bonanza			1
" protests spread across @entity17 " announced @entity20 's state - run @entity18			1
@entity23 government - controlled media showcased the dramatic pictures , " huge explosions , " " mayhem unraveling , " and what might look like the wholesale collapse of social order in @entity2			1
countries hostile to the @entity17 ignore this key aspect : behind the tv images of violence and the stunningly excessive , counterproductive police response , is that @entity2 is engaged in a profound , honest and what will prove to be a constructive debate about racism , law enforcement tactics , the weapons police use , and what life is like for minority teens			1
in countries where law enforcement is a tool to keep the regime in power and suppress political opposition , countries that have been on the receiving end of @entity52 and @entity53 criticism , @entity12 was a propaganda godsend			2
@entity10 's killing is an event with many layers			0
first , the killing itself , as details slowly emerge			0
second , the people of @entity12 's reaction , which points to a reservoir of real grievances beyond the specifics of the @entity10 case			2
then , the police response to the killing and to the protests			2
@entity12 has become a symbol of @entity2 's continuing struggle against racism , and the extremely serious and very urgent issue of police shooting to kill -- and killing			1
and there is the matter of their attitude and treatment of minorities			2
any coverage that deliberately ignores the context , that ignores the debate , is incomplete , and there is a good chance that it is deliberately misleading			0
responsible journalists covered the story with nuance and perspective			0
but that was n't the case everywhere			0
the government of @entity23 did n't even try to hide its efforts to gain political advantage			2
in @entity101 , the official government daily , under a picture of what is presumably an @entity52 man wearing leg shackles , readers learned of a @entity103 report condemning the @entity17 government 's " uses of such inhumane methods as testing medicines on inmates , forced sterilization of minority women , abuse of power by police			1
" the @entity113 clearly relished the opportunity to clobber the @entity17 on its prison system in response to the @entity118 's sharp criticism , particularly after members of the group @entity120 spent time behind bars and made @entity23 's prison conditions the subject of international condemnation			1
@entity23 's @entity125 , a government - controlled network whose reporters have been resigning in protest against its biased coverage , had fun mocking @entity2 's media freedom after @entity12 police arrested reporters covering the story			1
in @entity20 , where opposition leaders languish in prison for years and human rights violations at the hands of the government are well - documented , authorities used @entity12 to undermine @entity2 's criticism			1
@entity20 's deputy foreign minister @entity144 slammed the @entity17 for " its racist behavior and oppression of the protesters in @entity12			1
" speaking to reporters in @entity149 , he condemned the " racism of @entity53 societies ... those who claim to be advocates of human rights			2
" even in @entity158 , the government of @entity156 , heir to anti-american firebrand @entity157 , portrayed the events in @entity12 as something close to an uprising against the government			1
the state - owned television network @entity163 , which broadcasts throughout @entity2 , said the @entity12 demonstrations confirm " the presence of profound systemic problems with human rights and democratic norms in @entity2 society			1
" just to be clear , this is @entity158 , @entity20 , and @entity23 , criticizing the @entity17 for the weaknesses in its democracy and its handling of human rights			1
they were not alone in outrageous irony			0
the government of @entity176 , which killed thousands of protesters , urged the @entity17 to exercise restraint			1
and @entity180 media twisted the @entity183 spokesperson 's words when she called @entity12 a " domestic affair " outside her purview , to make it sound like @entity188 's defense against criticism of its human rights abuses , which it calls domestic affairs , should be off limits to foreign critics			1
even the terrorist group @entity194 got in the game , urging @entity12 protesters to embrace radical @entity197			0
" how is democracy treating you guys ? " it asked			0
to be sure , undemocratic , human rights violators criticizing the @entity17 does not exempt @entity2 from blame			2
clearly , @entity12 points to serious problems which need to be addressed , and are being addressed , with the rapt attention of the entire country			0
less cynical coverage can be readily found in other countries			0
the respected @entity209 newspaper @entity208 delves not just into the problem of race and policing in @entity2 , but into the debate @entity12 has sparked in the @entity214			0
@entity216 's @entity215 noted how the lingering racism undercuts @entity2 's moral stance in judgment of rights violators			0
many describe the inequality and prejudice that persists , but makes it a point to include the progress that has been made in race relations and the race conflicts that have surfaced in the author 's own country			0
in the end , for all the intensity of emotions and wall - to - wall domestic and international coverage , the @entity12 protests were limited in scope			2
another unarmed black man was shot and killed in @entity239 , and there was no uprising			0
the killing of @entity10 was a tragedy , but nobody died in the ensuing protests despite high - powered rifles and dramatic fireworks			0
@entity2 is hardly alone in experiencing racism , as the @entity251 - born @entity250 writer @entity249 pointed out			0
news coverage of the events in @entity12 are a reminder for all of us of the importance of looking at the full context when viewing what happens in any country and protecting ourselves from political manipulation as we follow the news .			0

@entity263 : critics , foes of @entity17 making *hay* with @entity12 , to portray @entity17 in flames
@entity269 : @entity158 , @entity20 , @entity176 , @entity23 media played story as if @entity17 social order breaking down
she says @entity12 definitely brings up racism , police weapons , treatment of minorities
@entity269 : but stories miss @entity17 ' soul searching , civil rights history , size of protests
