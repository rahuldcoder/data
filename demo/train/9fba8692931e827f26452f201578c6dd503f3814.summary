-- the @entity1 won their first @entity3 title since 1954 on monday , after the @entity5 - based team beat the @entity6 3 - 1 away at the @entity7 to secure a 4 - 1 victory in @entity10 's best - of - seven - game contest			1
after narrowly missing out in the " @entity3 " in 1962 , 1989 and 2002 , the result marked the @entity1 ' sixth overall @entity3 win , but only their first since the franchise moved from @entity14 to the west coast city in 1958			1
the game was the end of an incredible season for the @entity1 -- who qualified for the final by beating the @entity21 and defending @entity22 champions the @entity23 -- after they clinched a play - off place on the last day of the six - month regular season			2
but it was a disappointing night for the @entity6 , who were appearing in the @entity3 final for the first time in the team 's 50 - year history			1
is the @entity1 ' triumph bad for baseball ? veteran shortstop @entity34 -- who produced the winning hit in the final game of the 1997 series for the @entity38 -- sealed the win for the @entity1 with a three - run homer in the seventh innings , and the 35 - year - old @entity42 was subsequently named the series ' @entity44			1
" i did n't forget that we were playing a great offensive team like @entity47 , " @entity34 told the @entity1 ' official website			2
" that 's why i told my teammates , ' keep playing , ' because we know they can tie the game right away			0
" but the @entity47 - based team were unable to catch the eventual winners , and @entity53 starting pitcher @entity52 was also invaluable for the @entity1 , striking out 10 and scattering three hits over eight innings , allowing just one home run to @entity6 player @entity57 -- his side 's only score			1
" i felt pretty collected , " @entity52 said			0
" from the first inning on , my adrenaline kind of just dissipated and i was able to calm down			0
i was very poised out there			0
" the @entity6 had hoped for more on their @entity3 debut , but the team who had not won a play - off game until three weeks ago admitted they were beaten by better players			1
" not much worked for us this series			0
we won one game , " @entity70 of the @entity6 told his side 's official website			2
" they pitched better than us			0
they did everything better than us			0

@entity1 beat @entity6 3 - 1 to win best - of - seven @entity3 4 - 1
@entity5 - based @entity1 ended fans ' *56* - year wait for a championship *pennant*
it is the franchise 's sixth in total but first since it moved from @entity14 in 1958
@entity6 were playing in the first @entity3 final of the team 's 50 - year history
