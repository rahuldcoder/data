-- when president @entity1 announced on wednesday his proposals to curb gun violence , no surprise : gun advocates condemned it as the first step in a rapid slide toward tyranny			1
the night before , the @entity10 released an ad calling @entity1 an " elitist hypocrite , " because , the ad says , he 's " skeptical about putting armed security in our schools , when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school			1
" ( @entity1 had said in an interview last month that he was " skeptical " that the " only answer " was putting more guns in schools			1
) republicans and @entity26 alike condemned the @entity10 for using the president 's children in a political attack ad , but the ad was actually quite revealing			1
a sane person might argue that the president and his family require special protection because they face threats the rest of us do n't			1
but the @entity10 and many of its most fervent supporters do n't see it that way			1
as far as they 're concerned , all of us are just as threatened as the person in the @entity44			2
the fact that you 're an ordinary person and not the leader of the most powerful nation on @entity49 does n't mean you have n't already been targeted by an @entity51 death squad or a murderous drug gang , so you 'd better be prepared , not just with a gun but with an entire arsenal of military - style weaponry			2
but the real threat in the fantasy world some gun owners have spun inside their heads is n't terrorists			1
you know the people i 'm talking about : the " doomsday preppers , " the angry tea partiers talking about " watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants , " the folks who ca n't talk about guns for 30 seconds without bringing up @entity72 ( who , for what it 's worth , did n't actually disarm the @entity77 people , as so many gun advocates believe )			1
what 's important is n't just that these folks are paranoid , it 's who they 're paranoid about : the @entity84 government			0
opinion : real hypocrites are at @entity10 take , for one vivid example , @entity88 , the ceo of a @entity90 company called @entity91			1
in response to the prospect of stricter gun laws , he posted a @entity96 video saying , " if that happens , it 's gon na spark a civil war , and i 'll be glad to fire the first shot			1
... i 'm not letting my country be ruled by a dictator			0
i 'm not letting anybody take my guns			0
if it goes one inch further , i 'm gon na start killing people			0
" and who is it , exactly , whom he 'd be killing in this fantasy of his ? his neighbors ? no , he 'd be killing the duly constituted authorities of the @entity84			2
he 's talking about -- maybe dreaming about -- the day when police officers or members of the @entity84 military come to his door , so he can kill them			0
( @entity88 later apologized after @entity90 officials suspended his concealed carry permit			0
) ok , so this guy is an extremist			0
but there are thousands , maybe millions , of gun owners out there whose sentiments are only a notch or two more restrained			1
these people talk a lot about liberty and freedom and love to call themselves patriots , but they seem to have a real problem with democracy			2
in a democracy , if people are proposing a law you do n't like , you criticize it , you argue against it , you campaign against it , you vote against the politicians who support it			2
but if you believe in democracy , you do n't threaten to start killing people if it passes			0
you do n't say that if you do n't like a new law , you 'll start an insurrection to overthrow the government			1
yet that 's exactly what some people are saying , and it is n't just some lonely nut with a webcam and a @entity96 account			0
people like him are spurred on by a conservative media that encourages them to believe that every @entity1 administration effort they disagree with is n't just something objectionable , it 's the very definition of dictatorship			1
opinion : gun control is on all of us if you 're a regular listener to conservative talk radio , you 've heard @entity1 compared to @entity72 and @entity165 innumerable times , over every issue from health care to taxes ( after @entity1 's press conference , one @entity170 host tweeted , " freedom ends			1
since his election in 2008 , supposedly respectable politicians have talked about simply refusing to obey laws they do n't like , and some even proposed seceding from the union			0
to be clear , most gun owners are n't stockpiling canned goods and assault rifles in preparation for some kind of societal breakdown that will give them permission to act out the violent fantasies they 've been nurturing for years			1
but many would say that their " right " to own any and every kind of firearm they please is the only thing that guarantees that tyranny wo n't come to the @entity84			2
well , guess what : they 're wrong			0
in today 's world , most tyrants are n't overthrown by an armed populace			0
nonviolent revolutions can result in a quick transition to democracy , while violent insurrections often result in long and bloody civil wars			0
and here in @entity84 , it is n't 1776 , and it wo n't ever be again			0
the founders may have thought citizens should be able to keep a musket if they wanted , but they also wrote into the @entity211 that the government had the obligation to " suppress insurrections			0
" they hoped that our freedom would be guaranteed by our laws and institutions , not by a guy down the block with an @entity220 and a chip on his shoulder			1
they certainly did n't set up our democracy in the hope that every time any group of people did n't like a law that democracy produced , they 'd abandon any pretense of support for our system of government and start killing the cops and soldiers who protect us			2
there 's a word for people who dream about doing that , and it is n't " patriot			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2

@entity244 : @entity1 announced gun curbs ; gun advocates said it 'll be tyranny
@entity10 ad calling @entity1 " elitist " because his kids get protection is not sane view , he says
he says some gun advocates urge *resistance* to duly authorized law *enforcement*
@entity244 : freedom is guaranteed by law , not gun owners
