no , not with a man			2
but with a @entity6 apartment			1
an apartment i had yet to find			1
but i knew exactly what i was looking for , and exactly how it would make me feel			2
like a city girl , tough and tender , coming home			1
my place would be clean , bathed in sunlight , in an elegant prewar building , with a spare room for my college - age daughter			2
it would certainly not be fixer - upper ( a " wreck , " as we say around here ) , and would have updated plumbing and wiring			2
i 'd walk out of there every day feeling like a character in a @entity28 movie			2
i simply could n't live anywhere else			2
not so long ago , i wrote about a similar quest -- for a good man			2
that did n't quite pan out			2
now , after selling my suburban @entity34 house of 22 years , i set my sights on finding an affordable apartment in @entity37 in a vibrant , safe neighborhood			1
i know what you 're thinking : good luck with that			2
@entity6 2013 is the @entity43 of real estate			1
a seller 's market ? that 's an understatement			1
according to the @entity50 , a go - to place for apartment listings , in october 2009 there were 8,150 apartments listed for sale in @entity37			1
three years later , there were 6,241			2
by october 2013 , that number had dwindled to 4,344			2
based on their listings , the average price for an apartment in @entity37 , according to the @entity50 , is $ 1.1 million			1
@entity6 , we have a problem			1
the " man - apartment " similarities abound			1
sometimes , if you 're online dating and reach out to a good prospect , he does n't respond			1
busy , or not interested -- who knows ? but unavailable , for sure			2
trolling the real estate websites , you click on a link and find the apartment of your dreams			1
but it 's already taken : " @entity72			1
" strolling the avenue , you see a nice - looking guy			0
dare to lock eyes with him ? stop right there			0
did n't you see that little gold ring ? a good man in @entity6 is like prime real estate , snapped up before you can blink			1
photos are a source of hope and despair for both apartment - and man - hunters			1
any veteran online dater knows how important attractive profile photos are -- and how deceptive they can be			1
feeling butterflies before a first date ? perhaps because you 're not entirely sure the person you 've been chatting with online even resembles his profile photo			1
only by meeting will you know if this relationship is doomed , because more often than not , you 'll be burned by the big reveal			0
it 's the same with properties			1
using wide - angle lenses , photographers can make a closet seem like a ballroom			0
to help find my apartment " match , " i signed with an experienced buyer 's broker : @entity112 of @entity113			1
i might be in love with @entity6 , but i needed a reality check			1
" be prepared to be disappointed , " @entity112 said			0
" it 's ok to fall in love with an apartment , but you ca n't get too attached to an apartment			1
unless you 're making an offer on a dump , expect a bidding war			0
dozens of people show up for open houses , even waiting on line in the bitter cold to see apartments			0
a broker may hand you the sales sheet , which lists the apartment features and price , while declaring : " that 's not really the price			1
it 's going up today			1
" it 's a head - spinning exercise			1
you think you 're close to clinching a deal , and suddenly another buyer swoops in to offer cash for an apartment			1
your bid may be accepted , but until the seller signs the contract , you 're in limbo			0
could another buyer steal your apartment , and your heart , away ? @entity112 and i found a lovely place on the @entity152			1
the moment i walked in , i just knew			0
" i want that apartment , " i told her in the elevator			1
we entered a bid within hours			0
for days , the selling broker flirted with me , toyed with me			0
" there are other offers , but she 's a great candidate , " he told @entity112			1
we entered our " best and final " bid , but were tied with another buyer			0
in the end , someone offered $ 12,000 more			0
i guess best and final was n't really " final			0
how far will @entity6 buyers go to get an apartment they want ? once , when there were multiple offers , @entity112 recalled , " a buyer delivered a signed contract with a check for $ 100,000 over the asking price of the apartment			1
" there had been no negotiation			0
" the seller , of course , went with them , " she said			0
after losing two bids , i finally found the apartment i would buy			1
@entity112 , the ultimate real estate matchmaker , found me the right space at a decent price			2
it was n't love at first sight			0
( the ' 80s decor was nearly enough to kill all desire			0
) and it was not the prewar building i had pined for			0
but it was a good deal -- and with a little luck , everything fell into place			0
how could meeting a man in @entity6 possibly be as difficult as landing an affordable apartment ? @entity6 matchmaker @entity202 , of @entity203 , says it 's infinitely harder			1
just as in real estate , there 's a dearth of inventory			2
" in general , you have four single straight women to every single straight man , " @entity202 explains			0
" it 's the worst city			2
men here have so much choice that it gets distracting , " she adds			0
" @entity37 , specifically , attracts the most ambitious people on the planet			0
" and all those type - a personalities do n't work well for matchmaking			0
" you 're talking about the top 5 % , or top 1 % of women			0
they do n't take no for an answer and they have incredibly high standards , " says @entity202			0
as for men , " you have single dads , divorced dads , widowers , a good portion looking for women 10 years younger than they are			0
it 's a huge mismatch			2
" so , now that i 've gone to all the trouble of moving here -- how can i ever meet a nice guy ? maybe i should try another city			0
in @entity242 , for example , " there are four single men to every single woman , " says @entity202			0
" the men look incredibly good			0
they all work out , they all dress nice , they all have nice apartments			0
" that is , if i can ever bear the thought of moving again .			0
