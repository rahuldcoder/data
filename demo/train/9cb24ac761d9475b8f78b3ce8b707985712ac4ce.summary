@entity0 , the @entity1 surrealist artist whose works of sexual - industrial imagery and design of the eponymous creature in the " @entity7 " movies were known around the world , has died			1
his death was confirmed by a statement from his longtime friend and manager , @entity13			0
" we are absolutely heartbroken over the loss of this loving husband , selfless friend and supremely talented artist , " the statement read			0
" he truly was one of a kind , committed to his craft , to his friends and to his family			0
his warm personality , incredible generosity and sharp sense of humor were in stark contrast with the universe he depicted in his art. " @entity0 's art -- often featuring skeletal , tentacled , protomechanical ( @entity0 called them " biomechanical " ) figures rendered in shades of blue - gray and brown -- was a mainstay of dorm - room bookshelves and science - fiction hallucinations			1
among his most widely known works was the cover for @entity43 's 1973 album " @entity44			2
" but he 's probably best known for his design of the @entity7 , the extraterrestrial species in @entity48 's 1979 sci - fi / horror film " @entity7 " and its sequels			0
with its oblong , skull - like head , dozens of teeth , narrow torso and spiny , whip - quick tail , it was a fearsome creature that salivated acid and appeared to come and go at will			0
indeed , the being that terrorizes the spaceship in the first film literally explodes out of actor @entity61 's chest before skittering away			0
encouraged by " @entity7 " screenwriter @entity62 , @entity48 turned to @entity0 after seeing similar creatures in the artist 's 1977 book , " @entity66			1
" @entity0 and the special effects team won an @entity68 for their work			1
the @entity7 , also known as the @entity70 , later appeared in " @entity71 " ( 1986 ) , " @entity72 " ( 1992 ) , " alien : resurrection " ( 1997 ) , " @entity74 " ( 2004 ) and its 2007 sequel , and -- in somewhat different form -- " @entity77 " ( 2012 )			1
@entity0 , who called the creatures " my monsters , " told @entity79 in 2011 that his work was , indeed , shaped by nightmares			1
" i feel very , very safe and happy and i have no more nightmares , but at the time , in earlier days , i could heal myself through doing my work , " he said			1
@entity13 's statement addressed @entity0 's fondness for the @entity70			1
" it was certainly a design which @entity0 prized , much as he took great pride in his collaboration with myriads of music industry and film artists , since he began his glorious journey as a world - class painter , sculptor and designer , " read the statement			1
@entity0 was born on february 5 , 1940 , in @entity97 , @entity1			1
the son of a pharmacist , he showed a talent for drawing at an early age and originally trained to be an architect			0
but he maintained a separate life as an artist , turning to the field fulltime in the 1960s			0
he had a longterm relationship with actress @entity108 , who served as the model for several of his works			0
@entity108 committed suicide in 1975			0
@entity0 was married twice ; he is survived by his wife , @entity112			1
in the late ' 60s , a friend published a number of @entity0 's works as posters			1
within a couple years , he was in demand by galleries and curators			0
in 1974 , @entity0 was asked to do the design for @entity122 's doomed version of " @entity123 , " now the subject of a documentary , " @entity126			1
" among the other participants in " @entity123 " was one of @entity0 's heroes , the @entity130 surrealist @entity128			2
@entity0 also created the cover for @entity133 's 1981 album " @entity138 , " which featured the @entity135 singer with long needles impaling her face , and was a designer on the 1996 film " species			1
" his work was much praised			2
" i think his ideas are very existential , " @entity144 curator @entity143 told @entity79 in 2011			0
" what makes up a human being ; when does a life start , when does it end ; what is natural and what is unnatural			2
it 's always interesting and always relevant			0
" in later years , @entity0 had his own museum in @entity154 , @entity1			2
it included his own work , as well as pieces by @entity128 and @entity158			2
his life , @entity0 said in 2011 , had grown much calmer			2
" i have not to work absolutely now			2
i like to be free to dream , " he said			0
people we 've lost in 2014			0
