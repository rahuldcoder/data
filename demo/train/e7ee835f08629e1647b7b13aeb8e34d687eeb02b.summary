@entity0 -- the @entity11 has " put a proposal on the table " for @entity7 military forces to train and equip moderate @entity9 opposition forces for the first time , two @entity3 administration officials told @entity1			1
if approved , it would dramatically increase the role of the @entity7 military in @entity9 's civil war and would for the first time put @entity7 troops in direct contact with opposition forces			1
the idea has been under consideration since the august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity22 , which the @entity7 says was carried out by the regime of @entity24			1
there are few specifics on troops or other aspects of the military proposal , but both officials said the effort envisions training taking place in a country near @entity9			1
" we have any number of options under development that could expand our support to the moderate opposition , but no decision has been taken at this point , " @entity36 chairman @entity35 said when asked by reporters on wednesday about the proposal			0
@entity47 chemical weapons inspectors to return to @entity9 until now , any training and equipping of @entity9 opposition forces has fallen under the purview of the @entity51 and has not directly been acknowledged by the @entity7 government			1
the @entity3 administration has acknowledged providing logistical , humanitarian and some military assistance to rebels fighting @entity24 's forces in a civil war now in its third year			0
the training proposal was first floated in the days after the august attack as a means to step up @entity7 support for the opposition			2
the proposal envisions @entity7 troops training certain rebels on small arms , command and control and military tactics , according to one of the officials			1
weapons however would not be directly supplied by the @entity7 because legal authority does not exist for the @entity11 to arm the rebels			0
is the @entity7 back to square one on @entity9 ? president @entity3 , who blames @entity24 's regime for the attack and threatened a limited military strike as punishment , has vowed not to put " boots on the ground " inside @entity9			2
the training idea , however , has run into trouble in recent days as the @entity7 has focused on diplomatic efforts to turn @entity9 's chemical weapons over to international control , sidelining at least for now @entity3 's push for congressional support to take military action			1
both administration officials said the timing might be too sensitive now to engage in such an initiative			0
@entity35 initially hinted at the plan during a @entity94 hearing earlier this month			0
" the path to the resolution of the @entity9 conflict is through a developed capable moderate opposition , and we know how to do that , " he said			0
@entity35 noted the focus on dealing with chemical weapons			2
" i think that subsequent to that , we would probably return to have a discussion about what we might do with the moderate opposition in a more overt way , " he said			0
both administration officials declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information .			0
