-- a @entity2 jury on saturday found a millionaire guilty of murdering his wife in their upscale home			1
@entity7 was shot dead in 2009 in the house she shared with her husband , @entity9 , in the @entity11 suburb of @entity12			1
two years later -- and following a week - long trial and deliberations that stretched into a second day -- he was convicted of second - degree murder			0
soon after entering the @entity11 courtroom late saturday morning , @entity9 went to a back row and sat between his two visibly distraught daughters , one of whom had testified that she detected no animosity between her parents			1
he put one arm around both in order to comfort them for several minutes , before heading to his regular seat for the jury 's verdict			0
when the verdict was read , the 63 - year - old @entity9 showed little evident emotion , though his daughters continued to cry			2
according to an @entity36 arrest affidavit , the victim was found in the master bedroom -- " a large pool of blood at the top of her head " and a .357 @entity44 handgun on a nightstand next to the bed			0
she was shot between her eyes			2
@entity9 told police the couple were the only ones in the house at the time , besides their four dogs			2
after the verdict , prosecutor @entity53 said the jury 's message , and beliefs , were clear			0
" it says that out of anger , out of frustration , mr. @entity9 pulled a gun and shot his wife in the face , " she said of the verdict			1
defense attorney @entity64 , meanwhile , said his client " knows that we have good grounds to appeal ( and ) i think that he remains optimistic			1
" but the verdict still stings			0
" he 's disappointed , " @entity64 told reporters			0
" he hates leaving his family , obviously , as any man would			0
" during the trial , the defense contended that @entity9 loved his family , while prosecutors said the @entity2 millionaire 's demeanor -- along with the evidence -- proves he murdered his 55 - year - old wife			1
the defense rested its case thursday , a week after testimony started			0
it asserted that @entity7 died after a struggle over a loaded gun , not because of any ill intent of her husband			1
the prosecution pointed out that @entity9 called 911 the night of the shooting and said , " i just shot my wife , " then offered shifting stories as the call progressed and later in his conversations with relatives and colleagues			1
they said that his stories were inconsistent at best , while the evidence suggests that he pulled the trigger			0
" what i would like to do is appeal to one thing , and one thing only : your common sense , " fellow prosecutor @entity104 told the jury during the rebuttal phase of closing arguments thursday .			2

new : the prosecutor says @entity9 *killed* his wife " out of anger , out of frustration "
new : the defense says it will appeal , describing @entity9 as " optimistic " yet " disappointed "
