-- president @entity1 takes his first foreign trip thursday , but domestic politics will loom large as he tackles the explosive issue of protectionism in a meeting with @entity8 prime minister @entity7 , the leader of the @entity10 ' largest trade partner			1
@entity11 will be a major issue when president @entity1 visits @entity8 beginning thursday			1
at issue is a controversial so - called " @entity21 " provision requiring the use of @entity10 - produced iron , steel , and other manufactured goods in public works projects funded by the $ 787 billion economic stimulus bill			1
several @entity23 - leaning unions and domestic steel and iron producers favor the provision ; a large number of business and trade organizations are opposed			2
administration officials altered the language in the final version of the stimulus bill to ensure that the provision will not trump existing trade agreements such as the @entity36 , known as @entity36			1
@entity8 companies will therefore still have the chance to sell products used in stimulus - funded projects			2
@entity8 government officials , however , are still concerned by what they perceive as rising protectionist sentiment in the @entity10 that could potentially spark a trade war and , in their opinion , deepen the global economic crisis			1
@entity8 has been hit hard by the global downturn			0
the country 's critical manufacturing - based sales dropped 8 percent in december , reflecting roughly equal decreases in both volume and price , according to @entity54 , an agency charged with tracking key economic data for officials in @entity57			0
in a recent letter to @entity61 leaders , @entity8 's ambassador to the @entity10 warned that the @entity10 was losing the moral authority to pressure other nations not to erect their own trade barriers			1
" a rush to protectionist actions could create a downward spiral like the world experienced in the 1930s , " wrote ambassador @entity65			0
" in the end we got into this economic crisis together			0
we need to work together to build ourselves out of it			0
" some @entity8 leaders also cite unresolved concerns over what they perceive to be vague and potentially harmful language in the " @entity21 " provision			1
specifically , they are questioning whether @entity36 and @entity81 rules will apply to state and city governments receiving stimulus money for local infrastructure projects			2
they also cite uncertainty over what rules of origin apply to projects covered under the stimulus bill			0
a number of components in @entity8 products come from countries such as @entity97 and @entity98 , which are effectively excluded by the " @entity21 " provision			1
" this is no merely technical question ; different parts of many products come from different places , and intricately entwined supply chains could be seriously disturbed if they have to be disentangled , to the detriment of both the @entity10 and @entity8 , " the @entity101 - based @entity100 newspaper editorialized tuesday			2
" such questions can not wait for judgments in trade litigation , " the @entity100 argued			0
" @entity8 governments and businesses ... have to be ready for a long series of many minor battles			0
" @entity1 stumbled over @entity8 trade issues during last year 's campaign for the @entity23 presidential nomination			1
shortly before the @entity119 primary in march , he was extremely critical of @entity36			0
many @entity121 voters believe the accord has cost countless jobs by accelerating the erosion of the @entity10 industrial base			0
during a debate with then - sen. @entity127 , @entity1 agreed that the @entity10 should abandon the treaty if it could not be renegotiated			2
it was later revealed that one of @entity1 's economic advisers , @entity131 , had met with officials at @entity8 's @entity133 , @entity134 , consulate and allegedly assured them that @entity1 's trade rhetoric was more a function of politics than any deeply held policy position .			1

president @entity1 leaves for @entity8 on thursday ; to meet with @entity8 @entity140
one big issue : the " @entity21 " provision in stimulus plan
@entity146 now says that provision will not trump existing trade agreements like @entity36
still , @entity8 officials worry about what they see as new @entity10 protectionist tilt
