@entity0 -- @entity3 's presidential transition , already disrupted by the sudden withdrawal of @entity6 gov. @entity5 , may face another challenge in the confirmation hearings of his pick for attorney general			1
@entity11 likely will face a grueling round of questions from @entity14 during his confirmation hearings			1
while the @entity17 is expected to easily confirm the majority of the president - elect 's @entity20 appointments , it increasingly appears that attorney general designate @entity11 could face a grueling round of questions next week from @entity17 republicans who are already emboldened by charges of " pay - to - play " politics against @entity28 gov. @entity27 and a federal investigation into @entity5 , who @entity3 picked as his commerce secretary			1
" republicans are seeing enough different stories in the taints of possible corruption around @entity41 politicians lately , " said @entity33 , a professor of history and social policy at the @entity36			0
" where they can score some political points around this corruption issue , they will try to do it			0
" @entity11 has drawn heavy criticism from @entity14 over his involvement in former president @entity48 's last - minute pardon of @entity49 , a major @entity41 donor and billionaire financier charged with federal tax evasion			1
@entity48 pardoned @entity49 in the final hours of his administration on january 20 , 2001			1
@entity11 was a deputy attorney general at the time			1
@entity17 @entity41 have long braced for a tough committee hearing over @entity11 , especially after @entity14 successfully delayed its start to obtain more time to review his lengthy record in both the public and private sector			2
but after @entity60 sen. @entity59 , the judiciary committee 's ranking @entity14 , unexpectedly took to the @entity17 floor tuesday to castigate @entity11 over a wide range of issues -- even comparing him to attorney general @entity65 who was forced to resign -- democrats may have to brace for a tougher fight than they expected			1
" president - elect @entity3 chose not to seek my advice or even to give me advance notice in my capacity as ranking @entity14 on the @entity72 , " @entity59 said			1
" had he done so , i could have given him some facts about mr. @entity11 's background that he might not have known			2
" @entity75 , a presidential scholar at the @entity76 , said it 's not surprising @entity14 are targeting a particular appointment			2
" there always seems to be one appointee where the @entity17 opposition directs its firepower , " @entity75 said			0
" this year the designated fall guy seems to be @entity11			0
he 's going to be made to grovel			0
" @entity11 played a significant role in the heavily criticized @entity49 pardon , having communicated with @entity49 's lawyers frequently before it was issued , according to the @entity88			1
critics have charged that the @entity90 should have blocked the pardon , and @entity11 later said he wished he had handled the matter differently			2
supporters of @entity11 say his role in the pardon was limited , but @entity17 republicans , seemingly eager for at least one high - profile fight with the incoming president , are set to put the @entity49 pardon front - and - center when his @entity72 hearing kicks off next week			1
for a @entity14 still reeling from a demoralizing @entity102 , @entity11 's hearing will likely be the @entity14 's first chance to put heat on the president - elect in a very public way , and in the process demonstrate that it intends to stand up to the new administration despite its minority status			1
" with @entity11 they are going to look to score some points on the evening news , " @entity33 said			0
but the @entity49 matter is only one issue on which @entity14 plan to grill @entity11			1
also at issue , according to @entity14 , will be @entity11 's involvement with the @entity119 case and potential conflicts of interests with his work over the past eight years with a corporate law firm			2
" there are going to be some tough questions that @entity11 will have to answer , " a @entity17 @entity14 aide said			2
" we want to have a fair , open discussion for his qualifications for the job			0
" @entity14 say they are not specifically looking to block @entity11 's nomination , and the @entity14 would be unable to do so even if it tried given the @entity41 ' overwhelming majority in the @entity17			1
" we do n't want to be obstructionist			0
it 's not a partisan thing , it 's about examining his qualifications to be no. 1 at justice , " the @entity14 aide said			2
still , the opposition party often claims victory when it mounts a sizeable resistance to a particular nominee , as 42 @entity41 did in 2001 to president @entity143 's first attorney general , @entity142			1
but @entity3 can ultimately take solace in the fact that a new president 's @entity20 appointments are rarely held up in the @entity17 , no matter which party controls the chamber			2
according to the @entity17 web site , the @entity17 has confirmed 98 percent of all @entity20 appointments since 1798			0
in fact , the @entity17 has n't rejected any cabinet pick for nearly 20 years			0
it last rejected @entity154 , former president @entity143 's pick for defense secretary , in 1989			0
republicans also know that at a time when @entity160 expect @entity161 to confront the country 's ongoing financial crisis and recent flare - ups abroad , it might be in their interest not to delay confirmation of several important posts or appear overly partisan when it comes to confirming the majority of the president - elect 's appointments			0
" when these things get bad , it delays the whole process , " @entity75 said			0
" by the time the person finally gets the person he wants it 's march			0
@entity14 do n't want this to happen			0

confirmation hearings for attorney general - designate @entity11 begin next week
@entity14 criticize @entity11 for his role in @entity48 pardon of @entity49 in 2001
@entity14 unlikely to block @entity11 from becoming @entity3 's attorney general
