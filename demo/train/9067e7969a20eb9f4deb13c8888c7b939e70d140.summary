-- for the first time in nearly 40 years , @entity1 looks poised to limit the powers of the @entity5 intelligence community , an opportunity it should seize			1
when @entity1 returns from its august recess , surveillance reform will be high on the agenda			2
in may , the @entity11 passed the @entity12 , a measure aimed at ending bulk collection of @entity5 ' phone records under the @entity16			1
and in july , a much stronger version of the bill was introduced in the @entity19			1
the @entity19 version would curb the most egregious abuses of the telephone metadata program and represents a compromise among the @entity11 , civil liberties advocates and private industry			1
yet , important work remains			0
in particular , the bill does n't reform @entity29 surveillance under @entity30 of the @entity31			1
under that program , the @entity29 collects the content of phone calls , text messages , e-mails and other electronic communications of @entity5 who are in touch with foreign targets abroad			1
the problem is bigger than you think			0
a four - month investigation by the @entity44 into documents leaked by @entity46 confirms suspicions long - held by privacy advocates : the intelligence community is engaging in dragnet surveillance of people all over the world and in the process intercepting @entity5 ' international communications without any showing of probable cause			1
after reviewing a cache of roughly 160,000 e-mail and instant message conversations , the @entity44 determined that roughly 50 % of the communications were either to , from or about @entity5			1
the documents , which include health records , academic transcripts and revealing photographs , tell stories of adultery , mental illness , and religious conversion			2
this raises the question : when did @entity5 become digital bystanders ? the 2008 amendments to the @entity31 tell part of the story			1
in its original form , @entity31 prohibited the government from monitoring the phone calls and other electronic communications of @entity5 without a targeted order from the newly created intelligence court			1
the court , in turn , would only issue the order under narrow circumstances : the government had to establish probable cause that the @entity5 targeted was a " foreign power or an agent of a foreign power " and that each of the facilities and places to be under surveillance was associated with the target			1
the 2008 @entity31 amendments , however , upended this equilibrium and drew an arbitrary distinction between @entity5 ' domestic and international communications			1
the amendments allow the @entity29 to listen to or read @entity5 ' international communications in the course of targeting one , non-americans ; two , those located outside the @entity103 ; and three , those who possess " foreign intelligence information			1
" all three conditions must be satisfied , and all three are vague and broad			0
in determining " foreignness , " for example , @entity29 analysts must have only a reasonable belief that the target is foreign and located abroad			1
many have appropriately dubbed this the 51 % standard , and indeed some analysts have admitted to signing off on a target simply because their e-mails were written in a foreign language			0
although information collected inadvertently must be destroyed under @entity29 rules and regulations , there 's little court oversight over this process			1
" foreign intelligence information , " meanwhile , is defined so broadly that it includes information relating not just to crime and terrorism but also " foreign affairs			2
" this language was introduced in the 2008 amendments for the express purpose of widening collection efforts			0
under this approach , the communications of foreign lawyers , journalists and human rights workers can all be captured , including their communications with @entity5			2
@entity141 , @entity142 , @entity144 newspaper in @entity145 and @entity146 , for example , have reason to be worried , as do people who communicate with them			2
communications to or from these institutions could be collected under the guise of " foreign affairs			0
" others should be worried , too			0
once the @entity29 has its database , no law precludes the @entity29 from searching it for any @entity5 name or search term it wants			1
the @entity161 and @entity162 also have access to the @entity29 repository and engage in " backdoor searches " routinely			2
this dragnet collection violates the human rights of foreigners abroad and the constitutional rights of @entity5			1
indeed , in 2011 , under this sole program alone , the government collected over 250 million internet communications , not including phone conversations			2
the @entity44 's investigation suggests that many of these communications reveal private details about @entity5 ' lives			2
the @entity29 also misuses the 2008 @entity179			2
for example , under an absurd reading of the statute , the @entity29 engages in so - called " about " or " inadvertent " collection , in which it collects communications that are neither to nor from a foreign target but instead merely mention that name : in other words the data from @entity5 who are in direct contact with foreign targets can also be collected without a warrant			1
the story does n't end there			0
other loopholes exist , and so do other surveillance programs			0
indeed most of what we know comes from documents leaked by @entity46			0
but there 's much more that simply has n't been revealed			0
most troubling is @entity201 , a 1981 presidential decree that is being used to authorize wide - ranging surveillance programs distinct and separate from the @entity31 one			0
details are still sparse as the executive order is n't subject to court oversight and @entity1 has refused to intervene			0
but what we do know is troubling			0
according to the investigative website @entity210 , leaks tell us the executive order has been used to collect and store every communication coming into or out of the @entity213 as well as another country , whose name has been withheld from publication for national security reasons			0
and just recently , a person knowledgeable about surveillance under the executive order suggested that the @entity29 might be using it to create a national e-mail metadata database			1
probable cause , a time - tested safeguard against unreasonable searches and seizures , has been replaced with excessive deference to the intelligence community and obscure agency rules			0
a robust system of checks and balances , where searches and seizures were approved individually by neutral magistrate judges , has been swapped for general surveillance orders and bulky collection			0
and sensible targeting criteria , such as information relating to terrorism and crime , has been jettisoned for the amorphous standard of " foreign affairs			0
" secrecy has triumphed over transparency			0
indeed we still do n't know how many @entity5 ' communications are intercepted or even under what authority			1
still , progress may be in sight			0
in june , the @entity11 voted decisively to pass an amendment to an appropriations bill that would prohibit the government from searching the @entity29 database for @entity5 names unless it has reason to believe that they are engaged in wrongdoing			1
the @entity19 should follow suit			2
protecting @entity5 from terrorism is undoubtedly a national mandate			2
but so are fidelity to the @entity224 and the human right to privacy			0
opinion : i was targeted because of my faith			0

@entity12 before the @entity19 would limit @entity29 surveillance
@entity274 : @entity275 does n't *change* ability of @entity29 to gather *incidental* records on @entity5
@entity274 : global dragnet surveillance includes @entity5 with no reason
still , he says , @entity19 bill limits ability for government to search database for @entity5 ' names
