the soldier 's plight had come to an end			2
within minutes he was airborne			2
the helicopter 's rotors whooped so loudly that @entity2 could n't communicate clearly with the men on board			1

" yes ! " shouted at least one over the roar of the flight			2

@entity16 officials believe he was captured by the @entity6 , but may have been held by the @entity64 , a terror group that operates along the @entity11 - @entity13 border			0
the group is aligned with the @entity6 and @entity67			0
in the ensuing years , there were occasional video clips released by his captors			2
the so - called proof - of - life videos appeared to show the soldier gaunt and disheveled			0
over time , he appeared with a beard the @entity16 government acknowledged in may 2012 that it had been engaged in direct talks with the @entity6 to free @entity2			1

for more than year , there was no word of the soldier			0

that proof came in december in the form of a video of @entity2 , the first in three years			1
and it showed the effects years of captivity had on the soldier , who appeared haggard and unwell			1
with neither @entity16 officials or the @entity6 trusting each other , @entity98 officials took on the role of intermediary			0
the negotiations began in earnest last week , with @entity98 ferrying messages back and forth between @entity16 officials and the @entity6			0
it culminated in @entity108 , with the agreement that called for the handover of @entity2 in exchange for five detainees held at @entity113 , the administration officials said			1

there , waiting , were @entity16 commandos , according to the officials			0
in the air above , helicopter gunships circled			2
slowly , @entity2 walked toward the commandos			1

within a matter of minutes , @entity2 was aboard a helicopter bound for @entity144			1
on the helicopter , with the knowledge he was in the hands of @entity27 , @entity2 broke down and cried			1

army sgt. @entity2 writes on a paper plate because the helicopter is too loud
