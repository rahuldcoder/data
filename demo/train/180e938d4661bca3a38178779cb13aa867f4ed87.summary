@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is the @entity5 word for light			0
it 's something @entity8 has never had to live without			0
near where he lives in @entity11 , one of the most prosperous states in @entity14 , thousands of rural villages lack electricity or struggle with an intermittent supply at best			0
massive solar satellites would beam power back to ground - based receivers on @entity20			1
" we need to empower these villages , and for empowerment , energy is a must , " @entity8 said			2
" @entity26 is suffering a lot because of a lack of energy			2
" by 2030 , @entity14 's @entity29 estimates that the country will have to generate at least 700,000 megawatts of additional power to meet the demands of its expanding economy and growing population			2
much of that electricity will come from coal - fired power plants , like the $ 4 billion so - called ultra mega complex scheduled to be built south of @entity39 , a tiny village near the @entity40 , an inlet of the @entity41 on @entity14 's west coast			2
dozens of other such projects are already or soon will be under way			0
yet @entity8 has another solution for @entity14 's chronic electricity shortage , one that does not involve power plants on the ground but instead massive sun - gathering satellites in geosynchronous orbits 22,000 miles in the sky			1
the satellites would electromagnetically beam gigawatts of solar energy back to ground - based receivers , where it would then be converted to electricity and transferred to power grids			1
and because in high @entity20 orbit , satellites are unaffected by the earth 's shadow virtually 365 days a year , the floating power plants could provide round - the - clock clean , renewable electricity			1
" this will be kind of a leap frog action instead of just crawling , " said @entity8 , who is the director of @entity14 operations for @entity69 , a @entity70 - based company working to develop solar satellites			1
" it is a win - win situation			2
" @entity77 scientist @entity76 introduced the idea of space solar power in 1968			1
@entity80 and the @entity81 studied the concept throughout the 1970s , concluding that although the technology was feasible , the price of putting it all together and sending it to outer space was not			2
" the estimated cost of all of the infrastructure to build them in space was about $ 1 trillion , " said @entity88 , a former @entity80 technologist and president of the @entity90			0
" it was an unimaginable amount of money			0
" @entity80 revisited space solar power with a so - called " @entity99 " study in the mid- 90s but the research lost momentum when the space agency decided it did not want to further pursue the technology , @entity88 told @entity2			1
by around 2002 the project was indefinitely shelved -- or so it seemed			0
" the conditions are ripe for something to happen on space solar power , " said @entity106 , a director of the @entity107 , a group promoting public access to space			1
" the environment is perfect for a new start			0
" skyrocketing oil prices , a heightened awareness of climate change and worries about natural resource depletion have recently prompted a renewed interest in beaming extraterrestrial energy back to @entity20 , @entity106 explained			1
and so has a 2007 report released by the @entity124 's @entity123 , encouraging the @entity77 government to spearhead the development of space power systems			1
" a single kilometer - wide band of geosynchronous @entity20 orbit experiences enough solar flux in one year to nearly equal the amount of energy contained within all known recoverable conventional oil reserves on @entity20 today , " the report said			1
the study also concluded that solar energy from satellites could provide power for global @entity77 military operations and deliver energy to disaster areas and developing nations			1
" the country that takes the lead on space solar power will be the energy - exporting country for the entire planet for the next few hundred years , " @entity106 said			1
@entity147 , @entity148 , the @entity149 and @entity14 , according to the @entity124 report , are interested in the concept			2
and @entity151 , which has been pouring millions of dollars into space power studies for decades , is working toward testing a small - scale demonstration in the near future			2
but a number of obstacles still remain before solar satellites actually get off the ground , said @entity159 , president of the @entity160 , a @entity161 - based research organization			1
" like any activity in space , there are enormous engineering challenges , " he said			0
one major barrier is a lack of cheap and reliable access to space , a necessity for launching hundreds of components to build what will be miles - long platforms			0
developing robotic technology to piece the structures together high above @entity20 will also be a challenge			0
then there is the issue of finding someone to foot what will be at least a billion - dollar bill			0
" it will take a great deal of effort , a great deal of thought and unfortunately a great deal of money , " @entity182			0
" but it is certainly possible			0
" and @entity106 , of the @entity107 , said he thinks it will be possible in the next 10 years			0
" we could see the first operational power satellite in about the 2020 time frame if we act now , " he said			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... do you think beaming solar power down from space is feasible ? who should be responsible developing the technology ? why has it not been done before ? leave your views and comments in the @entity203 box below and we 'll publish the best .			1
