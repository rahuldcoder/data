@entity0 -- a new medical device that could save thousands of lives by preventing opioid overdoses was approved thursday by the @entity5			1
the hand - held auto - injector is designed for family and caregivers to administer a single dose of a drug called naloxone , which rapidly reverses the effects of heroin and other opioids			1
called @entity16 , the emergency treatment works like the well - known @entity17 -- an epinephrine auto - injector for serious allergic reactions -- as it is injected into the muscle and does not require training , making it more user - friendly			1
once injected , the naloxone stops heroin and other opioids from slowing a person 's breathing down to the point that it stops			2
the @entity5 approved the prescription treatment after just 15 weeks under priority status			0
@entity16 has long been used in ambulances and hospitals , but @entity16 now allows nonmedical personnel to carry the drug in a pocket or to store it in a medicine cabinet			2
as use of the new tool becomes more widespread , @entity0 is doing its part to help combat the epidemic			2
that was @entity0 attorney general @entity43 's message thursday as he announced a new program to provide all state law enforcement officers with naloxone and train them to use it			1
it 's the first state in the nation to do so , using $ 5 million in seized drug money to fund their @entity53 ( @entity52 ) program			0
currently , most law enforcement agencies are using the nasal spray version of the antidote , which is slightly different than the auto - injector			1
it comes in a kit that costs about $ 60			0
with a shelf life of two years , every kit has two pre-filled syringes of the drug , along with other items to help use it safely			0
@entity43 says using naloxone allows victims to be brought back " from the brink of death and buys more time to get to a hospital			0
" noting that there were more than 2,000 opioid overdoses in @entity0 in 2011 , @entity43 said , " it is n't every day that we can announce that we will save lives			1
" more than 500 lives were saved last year in @entity77 , where police officers have been part of a pilot program since 2012 to carry naloxone , @entity43 said			2
the antidote saved the life of @entity84 's son , @entity83 , in 2009			0
though he died 18 months later , @entity84 said " those 18 months were a gift			0
anyone that 's lost a loved one knows that even one more day is a gift			0
" she emphasized her support of the program , saying , " people are dying and we have this powerful tool to save lives in the midst of the epidemic			1
