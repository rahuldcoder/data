-- some of the bravest people i know are cowering today in eastern @entity3 , wondering where their supporters are			1
while our daily news zeroes in on @entity10 and @entity11 , the fiscal cliff and @entity14 sales , our friends in the war - ravaged part of the immense , mineral - rich @entity3 are once again convulsed in a conflict they did not choose			1
a resident from @entity17 , in @entity19 province , who for security reasons must not be named , sent me a heartbreaking e-mail accompanied by a photo taken by @entity25 ' @entity24			2
it shows a tiny girl leading a long line of displaced women who carry enormous loads on their backs , a look of utter desperation on her face as tears stream down her cheeks			2
the e-mail says , " this girl is a future mother , barely four years old and she must walk many kilometers due to the attack on her village			0
she cries , but who is listening ? no one takes care of her , no one to console her			0
her mother ca n't help because she is carrying their entire household 's possessions on her back			1
just one attack on this column of displaced people and she will find herself alone in the jungle			0
we only ask for peace			0
it 's unacceptable that we deny her the chance to grow up and become a mother one day			2
" it is shocking how ill - prepared the international community has been for this latest round of violence in @entity62			1
a leading hospital in @entity17 , where guerrilla forces have been poised to enter the city for months , sent desperate e-mails to friends around the world pleading for antibiotics , painkillers , plaster and bandages , as international agencies focused on evacuating their staff members from border areas			1
e-mails i received showed bloody , shattered limbs of children and badly wounded patients with expressions of horror and despair			0
many call @entity3 the " rape capital of the world , " and when you work as i have with the doctors and nurses who have treated tens of thousands of rape survivors , it 's hard not to acknowledge some truth to this terrible epithet			1
for the past 16 years , armed factions supplied by @entity94 , @entity95 and the ragtag and ill - paid army of the @entity3 government itself have carved up the @entity3 provinces of @entity99 , marauding , pillaging , killing , abducting children to be soldiers and , yes , gang - raping women and girls as well as men and boys			1
all the while , gold , diamonds and precious coltan ore have continued to be extracted and exported as the people of the @entity112 have suffered without electricity , roads , schools and good government			0
the single largest @entity118 peace - keeping force in the world , @entity120 , stood by virtually impotent last week as some 1,500 @entity122 rebels overran @entity17			2
@entity3 troops , many of them hungry and penniless , ran for the hills			1
and while we gathered around our @entity129 tables , the people of @entity17 hid in their homes or fled			0
for months , refugees from @entity19 have streamed across the border into @entity94 as the rebels , led by indicted war criminal @entity134 , have mounted increasingly brazen attacks on @entity19 villages			0
while driving across the @entity94 border into @entity17 in may , i saw buses and cars loaded with families carrying their meager possessions , once again fleeing chaos in their country and renewed attacks by the @entity122 rebels			0
last month when i traveled to @entity99 , @entity17 was under curfew			0
in @entity17 , people who have bravely defended the rule of law and supported human rights for more than a decade were terrorized into silence amid reports of targeted assassinations and disappearances			0
the @entity17 prison emptied out mass murderers and rapists , previously convicted by courageous magistrates in the mobile courts set up across the region in recent years			0
@entity120 reported that it was airlifting the magistrates to safety , an ominous sign that justice is giving way to guns			0
in 2008 , the @entity169 accused @entity134 of conscripting children and called for his immediate arrest			0
the court 's prosecutor has stated that he is as dangerous a war criminal as the @entity95 warlord @entity175			2
once again , governments responsible for setting up and subsidizing the international rule of law have failed these very institutions			2
meanwhile , in @entity99 's capital of @entity181 , a two - hour boat ride across the lake , residents prepared for the unknown			1
who launched the brazen armed attack in october on our beloved medical colleague , dr. @entity186 , whose hospital near @entity181 has treated tens of thousands of rape survivors ? was this a warning shot ? amazingly , in the midst of the current convulsions , military magistrates in this city are prosecuting rapes and pillaging by their own government 's troops as they defend the rule of law despite the chaos			1
as one of the magistrates told me wednesday , " it 's our country , and we will defend justice here until it 's no longer safe			2
" the courage and commitment to justice and human rights of our @entity3 counterparts are an incredible inspiration			1
their actions must inspire not only our admiration but our reciprocal commitment to respond with equal political courage and whatever other resources we can bring to bear			1
join us on @entity220 / @entity219 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity225 erupted in eastern @entity3 , creating a *humanitarian* crisis
@entity223 : the international community can not stand by and do nothing
she says there 's truth to the saying that @entity3 is the " rape capital of the world "
@entity223 : the courage of the @entity3 should inspire us to take political action
