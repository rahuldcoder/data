-- the proposal by the @entity2 to build an @entity4 center near @entity5 has drawn major media attention and engendered fierce debate			1
right - wing political commentators , politicians , hard - line christian ministers , bloggers and some families of 9/11 victims have charged that it is insensitive to 9/11 families , dishonors memories of the victims and will be a " monument to terrorism			0
" but here are the facts : the center is not at @entity5 but two blocks away , and the @entity2 seeks to build a center , not a mosque			2
the center is not designed as a local mosque for a @entity29 community but rather to serve the wider community			1
it is meant to improve interfaith and @entity33 relations and promote tolerance -- not just to provide services to @entity29			1
the proposed 15 - story community center will include a prayer room , offices , meeting rooms , gym , swimming pool and performing arts center			2
the controversy over @entity44 is not an isolated event			2
it is part of a much more far - reaching pattern and problem			0
mosque construction in the @entity50 has become a catalyst for increased anti-islam and @entity54 sentiment , discrimination and hate crimes in recent years			2
efforts to construct mosques to accommodate growing @entity29 populations have sparked intense opposition			2
a commentary appearing in the @entity62 last month attacked plans to construct mosques in the state of @entity65 : " ... there 's no denying the elephant in the room			0
neither is there any rejoicing over the mosques proposed for @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity5 because where there are mosques , there are @entity29 , and where there are @entity29 , there are problems			1
" it continued : " before @entity65 becomes @entity82 , it is worth noting that the capital of @entity85 was @entity86 until it became known as ' @entity87 , ' degenerated by a @entity29 community predominantly from @entity89 and @entity90 , whose first generation of ' @entity93 ' has made the @entity94 into a launching pad for terrorists			2
" in the face of such rhetoric , where do we go from here ? @entity101 and an increasingly multicultural and multireligious @entity50 ( and @entity102 ) , with their significant @entity29 populations , tests the mettle of @entity106 democratic principles of free speech and freedom of worship			1
unfortunately , @entity50 attitudes toward @entity4 and @entity29 often blur the line between the peaceful and rational mainstream majority of @entity29 on the one hand and the acts of a small but dangerous minority on the other			1
in some states , opposition to mosque construction has been led by politicians -- individuals charged with representing and upholding democratic values			0
in june 2010 , a @entity124 @entity123 candidate , @entity122 , opposed the @entity88 's proposal to build a mosque in @entity127 , charging the @entity29 center was not part of a religious movement , but a political one " designed to fracture the moral and political foundation of @entity133			1
" she warned , " until the @entity136 find it in their hearts to separate themselves from their evil , radical counterparts , to condemn those who want to destroy our civilization and will fight against them , we are not obligated to open our society to any of them			0
" the charge that @entity29 do not condemn terrorism has been made repeatedly , despite that post- 9/11 , many @entity29 leaders and organizations in @entity50 and globally have consistently denounced acts of terrorism			1
but major media outlets do not seem to find them newsworthy , and thus they must be found in smaller outlets on the internet			0
even though major polls by the @entity158 and @entity160 research center show that the vast majority of @entity50 @entity29 are well - integrated and , in contrast to many @entity29 countries , pluralistic in outlook , a 2006 @entity156 poll found that substantial minorities of @entity50 admit to having negative feelings or prejudices against @entity29			1
fewer than half the respondents believed @entity50 @entity29 are loyal to the @entity50			1
about four in 10 favored more rigorous security measures for @entity29 than those used for other @entity50 citizens and requiring @entity29 who are @entity50 citizens to carry a special @entity173 and undergo special , more intensive , security checks before boarding airplanes in the @entity50			1
@entity4 - bashing charges leveled with no concrete evidence by pundits and politicians ring hollow			0
the call by some @entity65 politicians for a delay in the construction of the @entity44 to examine its funding is simply grandstanding that reinforces the notion that somehow all @entity29 , mosques and @entity4 centers are guilty until proved innocent			1
@entity29 center flap recalls earlier @entity191 controversy over arabic - language school why should @entity29 who are building a center be any more suspect than @entity194 who build a synagogue or center or @entity197 who build a church or conference center ? as @entity65 's mayor @entity210 put it : " if somebody wants to build a religious house of worship , they should do it and we should n't be in the business of picking which religions can and which religions ca n't			1
i think it 's fair to say if somebody was going to try to on that piece of property build a church or a synagogue , nobody would be yelling and screaming			0
and the fact of the matter is that @entity29 have a right to do it , too			0
" @entity29 are part of the mosaic of @entity50 , citizens and believers who are economically , educationally and politically integrated			1
no longer predominantly new arrivals , many are second - and third - generation citizens			0
despite terrorist attacks by a very small but dangerous minority of extremists , the majority of @entity29 , like their non-muslim fellow citizens , are loyal citizens			2
@entity234 must be recognized for what it is , a social cancer as unacceptable as @entity237 , a threat to the very fabric of our democratic , pluralistic way of life			0
the line that distinguishes @entity4 from those who commit violence and terror in the name of @entity4 -- between the majority of mainstream @entity29 and the acts of a minority of @entity29 terrorists -- must be maintained			0
blurring these distinctions risks the adoption of foreign and domestic policies that promote a clash rather than co-existence of cultures and threaten the rights and civil liberties of @entity29			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0

@entity261 says there 's fierce debate over @entity29 center planned near @entity5
@entity267 : @entity44 is meant to improve interfaith *connections* in community
polls show many @entity50 leery of @entity29 ; they also show @entity29 integrated , loyal to @entity50
@entity267 : opposition to center goes against democratic principles , is *islamophobic*
