-- when @entity2 go to the polls on saturday they will be electing key players battling to govern one of the world 's most complicated countries			1
from corruption , claims of international interference , terrorism and religious extremism to overpopulation , inflation , poverty and unemployment , @entity2 has been famously dubbed by some as the world 's most unstable nuclear power			1
for much of its 66 - year existence , the nation of 193 million people has been ruled by a military government			1
but this year 's election is being hailed as one of the most democratic to date			2
according to the @entity29 , there will be 36 million new voters among the 86 million registered to vote and more than double the number of candidates ( 161 up from 64 that contested the 2008 poll ) will be women , according to @entity35			0
" there 's a new hope for the country and i hope that this will change the situation in @entity2 ; voting this time will make a difference , " one @entity2 woman told @entity0 's @entity37			1
first full term while the governing @entity48 ( @entity48 ) became the first civilian government to complete a full five - year term -- the three governments following the death in 1988 of military strongman @entity47 were all brought down by the army -- its legacy is a deeply fractured country with a faltering economy			1
violence in @entity2 's tribal regions remains a key challenge for the country			1
since april , the @entity58 in @entity2 has killed dozens of people in attacks on the three main political parties			0
many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of the biggest threats to @entity2			0
the @entity48 , however , is hoping to gain a second term led by @entity68 , the son of assassinated former prime minister , and party leader , @entity71			2
while , at 24 , he is too young to become prime minister in a country where the minimum age to hold the office is 25 , @entity68 -- as part of the @entity71 political dynasty -- is regarded as a key @entity48 asset			1
top challenger the @entity48 's main opposition comes from the @entity81 , led by one of the country 's leading industrialists and richest men , @entity82			1
he has been prime minister twice before and was overthrown in a coup and exiled when general @entity88 seized power in 1999			0
viewed as a religious conservative , his party , @entity2 's second largest , believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of @entity71 not given a massive boost to the ruling @entity48			1
following closely behind is @entity2 's third force @entity97 , the former star cricketer and heartthrob who leads the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) party			2
while he has struggled to turn his celebrity status into votes , analysts say he remains popular with @entity2 's urban middle class who support his call to end drone strikes in the country 's restive tribal regions and his pledge to sweep away rampant corruption by ending foreign aid			1
his party boycotted the 2008 elections , calling @entity88 a dictator			0
@entity88 's party admitted defeat in those elections and he was succeeded by the @entity48 's @entity119 , @entity71 's widower			2
now in 2013 , with the @entity48 fighting to win a second term , this is likely to be the first real electoral test for @entity97 's movement , which is seen by many analysts as having wide appeal for @entity2 's millions of new voters			1
@entity97 on tuesday was rushed to hospital with spinal fractures and a head injury after falling off an improvised platform attached to a forklift truck during one of the final rallies of his campaign			0
analysts say that while his party is unlikely to form a government , the accident is likely to boost his standing in the polls			0
return of @entity88 conspicuous by his absence in the 2013 poll is @entity88 , who returned from four years of self - imposed exile in march to take part in the elections , but has been banned by a court from taking part in politics			0
his party , the @entity150 ( @entity150 ) , has announced a boycott			0
@entity152 and liberal parties such as the @entity154 ( @entity154 ) and the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) , meanwhile , have borne the brunt of @entity2 @entity58 attacks in the run - up to the elections			2
offices of the major secular parties have been bombed by the @entity58 and its leaders assassinated , making open campaigning all but impossible for those parties			0
as a measure of the danger of @entity2 politics , @entity68 will not be present for the may 11 poll due to security threats , according to @entity2 's @entity168			2
attacks by the @entity2 @entity58 have been particularly virulent in the election campaign -- the first time @entity2 will experience a civilian - to - civilian transfer of power -- not only targeting secular and independent parties but even attacking a rally held by a right - wing religious party that 's normally sympathetic to the militant movement			1
at least 18 people were killed in the blast on monday at the rally organized by the @entity180 ( @entity180 ) party			0
the @entity58 claimed responsibility for the attack , saying that one of the party 's candidates had handed over members of the mujahedeen to the @entity189 like many @entity2 that have endured years of bloodshed and unrest , the party has vowed to continue campaigning despite the violence .			0
