the remains of @entity2 ambassador to @entity4 @entity3 and three other @entity5 landed on @entity2 soil friday afternoon in flag - draped caskets			1
the four men were killed in an attack this week on the @entity2 @entity10 in @entity11			1
teams of seven @entity13 carried the caskets off a c - 17 plane at @entity15 in @entity16 in a ceremony attended by a color guard and a chaplain , @entity20 col. @entity19			2
president @entity21 and secretary @entity22 gave remarks at the solemn transfer of remains in an airport hangar , where four hearses with rear doors open waited for the caskets			1
families of the victims and dignitaries were seated facing the hearses and a lectern			2
" there 's no doubt these are difficult days , " said @entity21			1
but he pledged that " the @entity2 will never retreat from the world			1
" " @entity5 , four patriots , they loved their country and chose to serve it and serve it well , " the president continued			2
" they had a mission and they believed in it , and they knew the danger and they accepted it			2
they did n't simply embrace the @entity2 ideal , they lived it , they embodied it : the courage , the hope and , yes , the idealism			1
" we will bring to justice those who took them from us , " @entity21 said			1
@entity53 said that @entity4 , @entity58 and @entity59 " did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob			2
" those countries ' leaders " need to do everything they can to restore security " in the face of anti-american protests arising from an " awful internet video , " she said			0
@entity53 said the four victims ' lives -- as well as all people who work in the @entity74 -- " are at the heart of what makes @entity2 great and good			1
" " @entity2 must keep leading the world			1
we owe it to the these four men to continue the long , hard work of diplomacy , " @entity53 said			0
" we will wipe our tears and stiffen our spines and face the future undaunted			0
" defense secretary @entity83 and vice president @entity84 also attended the ceremony			2
the other men killed in @entity4 include @entity87 and @entity88 , both former @entity90 commandos working as diplomatic security officers			0
the fourth was @entity92 , an information management officer who also had an online alter - ego legendary in the gaming world			2
four people have been arrested in connection with the attack that left @entity3 and the three other @entity5 dead , the top aide to the president of the @entity4 parliament said friday			1
those arrested were not directly tied to the attack , @entity101 , the chief aide to prime minister @entity102 , told @entity105 by telephone			1
@entity101 did not release the identities of the four suspects in custody , nor did he detail the allegations against them			0
the announcement came as the @entity2 is struggling to determine whether a militant group planned the attack that killed the four @entity5			1
blog : arrest and violence updates the head of @entity4 's ruling @entity118 , @entity119 , also confirmed the four arrests but declined to say to what group the suspects are linked			1
however , the government now believes the suspects are part of one of the many armed extremist groups operating especially in the eastern part of the country and @entity11 itself , he told @entity105			0
authorities also believe the attack was planned and deliberately carried out to inflict maximum damage on key @entity134 interests , particularly the @entity2 , he said			1
the government believes the attack was intended to drive a wedge between @entity5 and @entity4			0
asked what the @entity4 government was doing to ensure security , @entity137 answered , " we are doing our best to avoid further attacks			2
" but he acknowledged that authorities had little capacity to defend against the powerful extremist groups			0
@entity146 under secretary @entity145 has said that the attack appeared to be planned because it was so extensive and because of the " proliferation " of small and medium weapons at the scene			0
he was briefing congressional staffers when he offered that theory			0
but on thursday , three @entity2 officials told @entity105 that they had seen no evidence the attack was premeditated			1
a team of @entity158 investigators is expected to be in @entity4 by saturday , a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity105			0
agents are first conducting interviews outside the country to gather information about the attack , the source said			0
@entity21 vowed thursday that those responsible for the attack would be brought to justice			1
" i want people around the world to hear me			2
to those that would do us harm -- no act of terror will go unpunished			0
it will not dim the light of the values that we proudly present to the rest of the world			2
no act of violence shakes the resolve of the @entity2			1
" source : @entity190 central not behind @entity11 attack during an interview on @entity194 's " @entity193 , " @entity102 said thursday that there had been one arrest early thursday in @entity11 and that three or four others were being pursued			2
" the evidence itself is based on mostly pictures that were taken around the compound at that time , and also through some witnesses , " the prime minister said			1
conflicting theories flew in the hours after the four @entity5 were killed late tuesday			0
they died amid a protest outside the @entity2 consulate over a film that ridiculed @entity208 and depicted the @entity209 as a child molester , womanizer and ruthless killer			1
the demonstration was one of several protests across the region that day			0
protest as diversion @entity2 officials believe the attackers used the protest as a diversion			1
given what officials know about @entity190 in @entity4 , intelligence officials believe it is very unlikely that core @entity190 was behind the attack , a @entity2 intelligence official told @entity105 on condition of anonymity			1
the official was not authorized to release the information			0
meanwhile , @entity232 , director of communications for @entity233 , denied news reports that @entity2 officials had been warned of a possible attack			1
" this is absolutely wrong , " he said			0
" we are not aware of any actionable intelligence indicating that an attack on the @entity2 post in @entity11 was planned or imminent			1
" slain ambassador warned in ' 08 about extremists near @entity11 the @entity2 is deploying warships and surveillance drones in its hunt for the killers of the diplomatic staffers , and a contingent of 50 @entity13 has arrived to boost the security of @entity5 in the country			1
the @entity2 and @entity4 have embarked on a new relationship since rebels toppled longtime dictator @entity254 last year			1
@entity2 and @entity256 warplanes helped the @entity11 - based rebellion against @entity254 , who was wanted by the @entity258 for charges of crimes against humanity before he was killed in october			1
the jihadists suspected in tuesday night 's attack " are a very small minority " who are taking advantage of a fledgling democracy , said @entity262 , the @entity4 ambassador to the @entity2			1
sources tracking militant @entity271 groups in eastern @entity4 say a pro-al @entity272 responsible for a previous armed assault on the @entity11 consulate is the chief suspect			0
a senior defense official told @entity105 the drones will be part of " a stepped - up , more focused search " for a particular insurgent cell that may be behind the killings			0
rights groups have raised concerns about the @entity4 legal system , which is in the early days of being rebuilt following the fall of the @entity254 regime			2
" @entity290 violations against detainees in @entity4 are the norm , " @entity287 said in a june report			0
" @entity4 government officials told @entity287 that very few detainees have been formally charged and that very few of the cases have been reviewed by a judicial authority			0
" at the same time , the dominance of militia groups , " which in most towns and cities are stronger than the army and police , has complicated the rebuilding of @entity4 's justice system , " the report says			2
@entity305 has similarly warned of serious problems with @entity4 's legal system			2
its researchers also " found that hundreds of armed militias are acting above the law			0
" questions swirl around the attack there are numerous questions about what happened at the consulate where protesters had gathered to demonstrate against the film " @entity322 , " which reportedly was made in @entity319 by a filmmaker whose identity is unclear			0
chief among the questions is what happened to @entity3 , who went missing during the attack			0
what is known is that during the attack , a rocket - propelled grenade set the consulate on fire , and @entity2 and @entity4 security personnel tried to fight the attackers and the fire			1
as the fire spread , three people -- @entity3 , @entity74 information management officer @entity19 , and a @entity2 regional security officer -- were inside a safe room , said senior @entity146 officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity as a matter of practice during a briefing with reporters			1
@entity19 was later found dead , apparently of smoke inhalation , officials said			0
the @entity146 has not released details about how @entity3 died , though numerous media reports have said the ambassador was taken from the consulate to the @entity351 by locals			0
he arrived at the hospital , according to the reports , unresponsive and covered in soot from the fire			0
a doctor was unable to revive him and declared him dead , the reports said			0
@entity3 ' body was turned over to consulate personnel as they were evacuated from @entity11			0
as of friday night , funeral plans had not been announced for the four @entity5			0
