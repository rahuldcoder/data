@entity0 -- muslim and @entity4 groups on monday sharply criticized sen. @entity6 's comments that he would prefer a @entity8 president to lead the @entity9			1
the @entity12 @entity11 's remarks came in an interview with @entity14 , a web site that covers religious issues and affairs			1
" i just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on @entity8 principles , personally , i prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith , " the @entity11 presidential hopeful told the web site in an interview published saturday			1
@entity6 also said he agreed with a recent poll that 55 percent of @entity9 believe the @entity9 @entity27 establishes a @entity8 nation			1
" i would probably have to say yes , that the @entity27 established the @entity9 as a @entity8 nation , " he said			1
on sunday night , @entity6 sought to clarify his remarks while campaigning in @entity31 , @entity32			0
" what i do mean to say is the @entity9 was founded on the values of judeo - christian values , which were translated by our founding fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights , " he said			1
" i believe that anyone can be president of the @entity9 of any faith , " @entity6 said , saying he was angry his remarks were misinterpreted but " there 's nothing i can do about it			2
" @entity45 , spokesman for the @entity46 , said @entity6 's comments failed to recognize that @entity48 is not the only faith with beliefs that support the concept of human rights			2
" sorry , @entity53 and other faiths have their basis in human dignity , " @entity45 said			0
@entity6 's remarks also " go against the traditions of @entity9 pluralism and religious pluralism and inclusion , " @entity45 said			2
@entity45 's organization , a @entity0 - based @entity53 civil rights and advocacy group , said it 's trying to organize a group of @entity3 leaders to meet with @entity6			0
the @entity67 , an advocacy group representing @entity68 , also called on the @entity11 to denounce the remarks formally			0
" former maverick @entity6 's statements were repugnant , " the group 's executive director , @entity70 , said in a statement			0
" it 's been sad watching him transform from political maverick to religious right mouthpiece			0
" @entity70 added , " someone running for president ought to understand the @entity27 a little better			0
nowhere does it say the @entity9 is a ' @entity8 ' nation			2
how can we trust someone to uphold the @entity27 who does n't even know what is in it ? " @entity6 's communication director , @entity89 , issued a statement sunday defending her candidate 's comments : " read in context , his interview with @entity14 makes clear that people of all faiths are entitled to all the rights protected by the @entity27 , including the right to practice their religion freely			1
" in the interview he also observed that the values protected by the @entity27 , by which he meant values such as respect for human life and dignity , are rooted in the @entity8 tradition			1
that is all he intended to say to the question , @entity9 is a @entity8 nation , and it is hardly a controversial claim			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity1 's @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 contributed to this report			0

sen. @entity6 says @entity27 established @entity9 as a " christian nation "
@entity6 later said @entity9 founded on @entity8 tradition of human rights
