if you thought you were going to be reincarnated as a horse -- you 'd probably want to be born here			2
that was the madcap idea which prompted an 18th - century @entity4 prince , @entity5 - @entity3 , to build the most spectacular horse stables in the world			1
legend has it that the wealthy royal commissioned the luxurious @entity11 in northern @entity4 because he believed he would be born again as a horse -- and not just any old royal box would do			1
at more than 180 meters long -- roughly the same size as two soccer fields -- the stables at @entity18 are not only a spectacular feat of architecture , they 're also home to a famous collection of equine artworks and the rarest ponies on the planet			1
this weekend the @entity26 -- and its adjoining museum of the horse -- will again be unveiled to the world as part of a $ 3.3 million makeover led by the fourth @entity32 , both a business magnate and the spiritual leader of 20 million @entity34			1
" it will be one of the few museums in the world totally dedicated to the horse , in all aspects of life , " his highness prince @entity32 told @entity37 of his grand project			1
rescued relic built almost 300 years ago , in 1719 , the @entity26 was one of the most breathtaking buildings in the world , housing a whopping 250 horses and 300 hunting dogs on the manicured lawns and lakes of the opulent @entity54			1
in the evenings , @entity55 would hold sumptuous dinners under the building 's monumental dome , which soars 28 meters high			1
but by the turn of the 21st century , the stables and museum had become a dusty shadow of their former glory			2
" it was the most stunning building built for horses in the world , " @entity65 , director for museums and exhibitions at the @entity68 , told @entity37			1
" the prince was a cousin of the king and i think he wanted to create something which would rival the @entity75 of @entity76			2
" but in recent years it was falling into disrepair -- there were problems with water seepage from the lake , the roof needed to be repaired			0
" that was until @entity32 -- a renowned horse owner and breeder , perhaps most notably of @entity86 -- invested his fortune in an ambitious project to transform the sad old relic into a world - leading equine exhibition			1
" the mayor came to me and said , ' would you join us in financing the saving of @entity18 's race course ? ' said the @entity32 , who has had an office in the area for " many many " years			1
" and i said , ' but i 'm not interested in only saving the race course			0
i 'd like to widen the spectrum to the whole of @entity18			2
' " treasure trove venture inside the elegant museum and you 'll discover a remarkable collection of hundreds of paintings , sculptures , and curios , depicting everything from mythical horses to racing thoroughbreds			0
the building 's 17 garages , which originally housed elegant carriages in the 1700s , have been converted into gallery rooms and a caf√©			2
" we have a crazy mixture of everything from @entity122 artist @entity121 's cartoons to major works of art by 15th - century renaissance painters , " said @entity65			0
" you have a lot of horse museums around the world which deal with certain aspects -- such as racing or equipment			2
but nothing which has the ambition to tackle the extraordinary history and beauty of the horse in full			0
" but it 's not just rare artworks attracting 160,000 visitors a year			0
also referred to as the " @entity142 , " the lush green estate is home to more than 30 breeds of horses -- including the only one of its kind in @entity150			0
among the cantering thoroughbreds and @entity153 ponies is 10 - year - old @entity154 -- the first and only @entity156 horse to step foot on the continent			0
the @entity156 are descendants of horses used by ancient @entity162 warriors , known for the courage in battle and distinctive inward - curving ears race to the top drifting in to the gallery rooms this weekend will also be the roar from the crowd at @entity4 's second biggest horse race -- the @entity172 , which is for three - year - old fillies			1
sunday 's prestigious race takes place on the pretty @entity18 course , nestled in front of the towering @entity177			1
it is a special day for the @entity32 , who has had seven winning thoroughbreds in the competition -- the most of any horse racing owner			1
" this year we do n't have a runner -- i was hoping we would have but the filly 's last race was not what we wanted , " he said			0
" every time i 've won it has been with a home - bred filly			0
the goal of my farm is to breed winners			0
i do n't buy racing stock , the results are dependent on my breeding			0
" as @entity65 says , part of the appeal of the museum is n't just its multimillion - dollar setting -- it 's also man 's enduring fascination with these four - legged beasts			2
" the horse has always been a strong , independent animal -- a friend of man , not a slave of man			0
and i think that 's part of the reason why it still captures our imaginations today			0
