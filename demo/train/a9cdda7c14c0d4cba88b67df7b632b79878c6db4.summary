-- presidential libraries always seem to be the center of controversy and debate			1
right now a number of cities are competing to host president @entity8 's library once he leaves office			1
there will certainly be a flood of stories about the vast fund - raising that will take place to secure money for the building since , according to the laws governing these libraries , the buildings are privately funded			2
at president @entity22 's archive in @entity23 , @entity24 , there was a heated controversy over the failure to appoint a new director to replace @entity28 , a distinguished historian who came into conflict with the library 's board for trying to put together an honest presentation for visitors about the @entity34			1
the @entity22 foundation blocked the appointment of @entity37 , a widely respected diplomatic historian at the @entity38 , because of his writing on @entity40			0
there is a heated contest currently taking place to decide which city will house @entity8 's library after his term ends			1
applicants from @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 are among the 13 that are engaged in a competition to win the right to host the museum and archives that will honor @entity8 's service to the nation			1
but the most important question about presidential libraries is not where they 're located , but how they handle the release and processing of the @entity65 records			1
this too has been the subject of controversy			0
according to the law , most presidential records are to be released by 12 years after a president leaves office			1
some documents might still be kept secret as a result of matters such as national security concerns			0
in 2001 , president @entity76 stirred controversy with an executive order giving former presidents much more leeway in restricting papers after the 12 - year period ended			2
the order came under intense criticism from the historical community and public interest advocates			0
a judge overturned much of the order in 2007 , and @entity76 himself has signed an order encouraging a speedier release of his documents			2
but delays in the release of some of president @entity96 's papers beyond the 12 years have caused more concerns about the power that former chief executives have over these kinds of documents			1
some critics have speculated that @entity8 has allowed for the continued delays to protect @entity104 from questions if she runs for president in 2016			1
@entity8 -- who had been critical of @entity76 's preference when in the @entity65 toward tighter restrictions on presidential papers -- accepted the delays in the release of @entity96 's records			1
he issued an executive order in 2009 that established a 30 - day period for a president to review proposals from the @entity116 to release the records of a previous president			1
under that order , however , an unlimited number of extensions are permissible			0
there is important legislation pending in the @entity124 that would curtail how much authority a president has to restrict the release of these records			1
this kind of legislation is vital since the archives contained in these libraries are a national treasure -- and access to the archives allows scholars and journalists to really examine the history of each @entity65			1
with all the controversies that loom over these libraries , the one thing that 's unquestionably needed is a speedy release of papers			1
these archives , which are an essential part of these museums , are incredibly important for our understanding of presidential history and the foundation of our current politics			1
the presidential library system took form in 1955 with the @entity152			1
the legislation created a national system of presidential libraries that would be run by the @entity116 but privately funded			1
@entity156 passed legislation in 1978 that ensured that the official records of each president and his staff would go to the archives rather than remaining private property , as they had been considered before			1
the findings from the archives have had a huge impact on how we think about many periods in @entity169 political history			2
democrat @entity170 , who ended his term in 1952 as a highly unpopular president , has seen his image rebuilt as historians took a close look at his records and found the important role that his administration played in developing our @entity180 policies and institutions to contain communism			1
a president who once looked as if he made one blunder after another came out of the archives looking much more astute and skillful than anyone ever imagined			1
@entity190 president @entity189 is one of the most famous cases of how a reputation can be transformed			1
for many years , journalists and scholars thought that @entity189 was an affable and incredibly popular president , but a leader who was hands - off and allowed his staff to handle most of the major decisions that took place during his term			2
but the archives proved that the situation was quite different			2
according to the @entity203 presidential scholar @entity202 , the records show that @entity189 ran a " hidden hand " presidency where he was extremely proactive behind the scenes			1
he consciously allowed the public to think that he was not doing much , so that he could look as if he was standing above the political fray , at the same time that he was very careful in making decisions about party strategy and public policy			0
@entity212 is another case in point			0
for many decades , the assumption about the war in @entity40 was that @entity212 and his advisers blindly followed the logic of the domino theory , meaning the notion that if @entity40 fell to communism other countries would follow			0
according to this standard account , policymakers could not see the huge mistake they were making and it was virtually inevitable that the @entity169 would end up in this protracted war			0
but slowly that notion of the war has been shattered			0
the presidential tapes and the archives in @entity232 , @entity233 , have revealed that @entity40 was much more of a choice -- a contested choice -- than we ever thought			1
through the archives we have learned that many of @entity212 's closest advisers , including hawks like sen. @entity241 , expressed strong doubts about the necessity of the war and whether it could be won			2
as the @entity247 historian @entity246 wrote in his book " @entity253 , " for many reasons , including politics and perceptions of his manhood , @entity212 eventually chose the path of escalation despite intense opposition			0
@entity22 's archives have been both good and bad for his legacy			2
on the one hand , the archives have continued to expose all sorts of wrongdoing that took place in his @entity65			2
@entity22 was every bit as bad as @entity169 thought at the height of the @entity34			0
we learned that he was devious , calculating and ruthless			0
on the other hand , the archives have helped to change and rehabilitate our image of @entity22 by demonstrating his extensive accomplishments on foreign and domestic policy			2
this was an administration that made huge progress on the environment , affirmative action , detente and more			0
sometimes the archives do n't produce a huge makeover			2
president @entity284 's archives in @entity285 , for example , which are extensive and provide a terrific look at the behind - the - scenes events of the period , have not erased the negative images people have			1
the findings have confirmed many of the political missteps and problems that the administration had with @entity156 and the public			0
@entity297 , however is a different story			0
he was once thought of as a lightweight @entity300 actor who walked his way through political power -- like the character from the film " being there			0
" but we have learned that he was much more strategic and thoughtful than most people ever imagined			0
transcripts of his radio addresses in the 1970s show how he carefully tailored particular messages and thought through the rhetoric he wanted to use			0
minutes from the @entity313 meetings in his presidency reveal a very hands - on and deliberative person , not the caricature that was so popular in the 1980s			0
we are only starting to learn about @entity319 , whose archives are beginning to be opened to researchers , as well as about @entity96 , as the trickle of findings about his presidency has revealed			1
historians will be eager to look at the papers of @entity76 , someone who once was resistant toward releasing records but has now indicated he will have them out sooner than most			1
presidential archives are a national treasure and they are absolutely essential to our ability to understand what actually happened during the four or eight years a person was in office			2
legislation moving through @entity156 now would expand access to presidential records and guarantee that the archivists retain the e-mails of executive branch officials			2
it passed the @entity65 in january on a voice vote , and in may , the @entity343 sent the bill to the @entity124			0
the legislation would allow for 60 days of review with only one 30 - day extension allowed			0
the legislation also requires the public to be notified of these proposals when they are sent to the @entity65			0
right now they are not public			0
@entity156 must keep the pressure on to make the records public , to require that more are digitized and made accessible online , and to ensure that all of this is done as quickly as possible and with as little interference as possible , so that scholars and journalists can look at the records to start evaluating , analyzing , and interpreting what the nation has lived through			0
join us on @entity364 / @entity363 .			0
