a dozen young children chatter and giggle around me , taking my pad and pen to write down their addresses very carefully			1
this way , they tell me , i 'll know where to send help			1
but how do you tell a six - year - old an address no longer means anything -- houses and roads are gone and in too many cases , so are families			1
it was not just the young who could not comprehend how their world changed on december 26 , 2004			1
in @entity18 on the south coast of @entity20 , a parent stumbled through mangled debris in the area they assumed their house had once stood , looking for lost children			1
siblings , children , cousins , all looking for a sign of relatives they lost in a split second when the water came			1
standing in the middle of what was once the marketplace of this seaside town , i looked around at a landscape that was almost flat			1
no buildings for miles , giving a clear view of the sea that was deceptively calm and serene			1
only one temple was left standing , the one structure built from concrete			1
homes were washed away with residents still inside , market stalls and thousands of shoppers did n't stand a chance against the sheer force of mother nature			1
it is impossible to capture the extent of the devastation on camera and only those who lived through that day know its true horror			1
but one overwhelming memory for those who arrived afterward is the look in survivors ' eyes			2
i accompanied a @entity65 doctor working for @entity66 , @entity67 , who had volunteered to help and deliver desperately needed supplies			2
he told me he would never forget " the victims , dead - eyed in their hospital beds , lying there , staring at us , wondering what their stories were , how they 'll ever learn to cope with this , what they 've seen , what they 've lost			2
" and yet in the midst of the misery i witnessed in @entity20 was incredible generosity			1
residents who had lost everything , who had seen horror beyond imagination , running up to us to offer a face mask to help cope with the unmistakeable stench of death , trying to give us a bottle of water			2
one man even apologized we were not seeing his country at its best , begging me to come back when it was all over so i could experience the true beauty and hospitality of the island and its people			2
he then resumed the search for his brother , sister and parents			2
the sheer scale of the disaster was difficult to overstate			0
one @entity18 hospital that could take 300 patients at a push saw 1,000 serious injuries in the first two days alone			1
basic drugs many of us take for granted ran out quickly and the bottleneck of relief , familiar in such disasters , took time to clear			0
and yet rarely did i see frustrations spill over			0
residents helped each other and comforted each other			0
one textile factory had been badly damaged , some of the workers were dead or missing			0
but rather than wait for outside help to arrive , the workers cleared the building of mud , debris and bodies so they could go back to work			0
many of the women were married to fishermen who had lost boats or were too scared to go back out on the water			0
without the factory , their families had no income			0
natural disasters are cruel and brutal			0
there is no one to blame and little comprehension			0
and yet they never fail to restore my faith in human nature			0
strangers work together to pick themselves back up and rebuild their shattered lives			0
many thinking of others rather than themselves			0
what i witnessed in @entity20 was both heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time .			0
