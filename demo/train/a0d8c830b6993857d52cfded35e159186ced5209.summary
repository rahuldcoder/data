the bereavement fare was once the airline industry 's gift to the traveler , an acknowledgement that a customer was flying for the saddest of reasons : a medical emergency or death in the family			1
the last thing anyone wanted to worry about was the cost of an airplane ticket			0
and so many airlines offered discounts to help ease the pain of the journey			0
in the wake of its merger with @entity21 , @entity22 this week became the latest major @entity24 airline to end its policy of offering bereavement fares			1
@entity21 did n't offer the special fares before the merger , and @entity24 's new chief executive officer , @entity29 , came from the ranks of @entity21			1
" we remain committed to doing all we can to relieve the burden of travel for our customers in times of need			0
with the advent of more choices , lower cost carriers and larger networks , the industry has started to move away from bereavement fares because walk - up fares are generally lower than in the past , and customers now have more opportunities to find affordable fares at the last minute , " @entity24 spokesman @entity36 said in a statement			1
" @entity24 is moving toward that industry trend and the airline offers customers changeable and refundable options with the ability to apply future reservations to bereavement travel without change fees			1
we believe this policy is a cost - effective solution for customers in need of bereavement travel			0
" except for possibly waiving the change fee , the new policy does n't sound so different from what @entity24 offers other customers			1
but not every carrier is going the way of @entity24 , at least not yet			2
@entity67 and @entity68 are keeping their current bereavement policies in place			1
' better service ' for consumers promised before the @entity21 - @entity24 merger was approved last year , @entity29 , then the @entity21 ceo , testified before @entity74 that consumers would benefit from such consolidation			2
" by putting these two airlines together we 're able to provide better service , more efficient service , to consumers , " @entity29 said			0
it remains to be seen if consumers will agree with his sentiments , but @entity24 is n't breaking new ground with this particular policy change			1
making planes in the world 's biggest building discount carriers @entity89 ( and its @entity91 brand ) and @entity92 have never offered bereavement fares			1
" offering bereavement or emergency fares would make it necessary to offset these discounts by charging higher ticket prices and reducing the amount of sale fares we currently offer , " @entity89 spokesman @entity94 said			1
@entity89 does n't charge fees to change an existing reservation , just the price difference between the current and new tickets , @entity94 said			1
cheaper online fares can be found frequent travelers know that better fares can usually be found online for last - minute emergency travel , according to travel blogger @entity111			0
that 's why he said the change wo n't have much of an impact			0
" it does make the airlines look heartless , " @entity111 said			0
" i 've known people who did n't travel to a loved one 's funeral because they could n't afford the last - minute ticket			0
" @entity124 aviation consultant @entity123 , who testified before @entity74 last year on the potential impact of the @entity21 - @entity24 merger , said he is n't surprised by the policy change			1
" it 's a natural outgrowth of a shrinking industry since consolidation leads to fewer choices , higher fares , and less service , " @entity128 wrote via e-mail			0
" unfortunately , consumers should expect this trend to continue as the domestic airline industry rapidly consolidates through mergers and acquisitions			0
" @entity142 's @entity141 raises prices discounts at @entity68 , @entity67 still , @entity67 and @entity68 remain holdouts			1
@entity67 's bereavement policy , which " offers additional flexibility on the best published fare , " lists the documentation required and the types of relatives who qualify on its website			2
the airline reminds customers that lower promotional fares may be available through its website or airline reservations service			2
@entity68 offers a 5 % discount on one - way and round - trip fares in the event of the death or serious illness ( requiring hospitalization or hospice care ) of an immediate family member			2
its website lists the airline 's requirements to qualify for the airfare			0
five percent off a $ 1,000 ticket still is n't much -- $ 50 -- so it 's possible that consumers would still be better off searching online for the best deals			0
but even with such a small benefit as @entity68 's , maybe it 's the thought that airlines recognize their grieving customers that counts			2
