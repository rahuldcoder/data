@entity0 , @entity1 -- my dad died when i was 2 , so my mother raised us [ @entity7 and his sister ] and exposed us to different things			1
we took music lessons , art appreciation lessons , and we even went to finishing school			1
my sister and i hated it at the time			1
we just wanted to be normal kids and eat our @entity18 on saturday mornings in front of the television , watching our @entity21			2
my mom was a very good cook			2
in fact , she was a private cook for an attorney for years			1
she exposed my sister and i to the same types of food that she was cooking at work			1
we were basically the only kids on our block that had eaten lobster with drawn butter			1
on holidays , we would go to work with her			2
we 'd always sit in the kitchen			2
i was just amazed with all the cooking ingredients and implements			1
i was one of those guys that was never picked to be on someone 's baseball team or basketball team , so i started cooking			1
my mother had always had a lot of cookbooks			2
i just started playing around			2
we always had butter ; we always had flour and sugar and vanilla and eggs			2
i might have looked at other recipes and did n't think we had the ingredients , and i certainly did n't have money to go buy them			2
the first thing i baked was a cake			2
i was 9 or 10			2
it was a plain yellow cake			2
i can remember the icing being a little runny , but it was good			2
we went to catholic school			0
we went to @entity62 once a week , while in school , as well as on sundays			0
@entity64 has always been with me			1
read more about faith and religion on @entity2 's @entity67 i 've certainly called on @entity64 when i 'm in the kitchen , when things are going wrong , when i 'm irritated or very upset about something			1
i 've called on @entity64 walking up here to unlock the doors and come into work -- to help me at not being quick - tempered or losing my cool			1
help me be the person i need to be			0
it [ becoming a priest ] is something that i thought about as a child			1
it was something i was going to do out of high school , and i put it off			0
i 'm glad now that i did n't go through with it , because i was very immature			0
but now i feel very strongly , and i know in my heart that i 'm ready to do it			0
i did n't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say , " well , i think i 'll try the priesthood			1
" there 's a lot of prayer involved			1
this prayer process , that 's neverending			1
i have a spiritual director i work with , and i started out with that at first			1
but this process of thinking about it , it 's been all my life			1
i developed a very close relationship with the archbishop [ archbishop @entity96 of the @entity97 ]			0
he was here , at the restaurant , one night about two or three months ago , and i said , " there 's something on my mind , and i 'd love to talk to you about it			1
" i met with him , and i was n't home 10 minutes and the vocation director called			0
i set up another appointment to meet with him , and the rest is history			0
there are parts of it [ the restaurant kitchen ] that i 'll miss and parts of it that i will not miss. i will miss the people			1
i will miss the guests			0
the cooking aspects , i definitely will miss. i will not miss the rushiness of it , the overwhelming feeling you get when you 're working the line , and it looks like everyone is ordering at the same time			1
i 'm hoping i can still do things [ in a kitchen ] , but i 'm hoping i can do it on a small scale , for fun			0
i would love to do something for the needy or poor , during the holidays when people really feel their lowest			0
not just your typical out - of - the - can , warmed - up meal ; i 'd like to do it [ serve them ] just like you 'd get here			1
i 'll move into the seminary			1
i am looking forward to embracing the simple life			0
that gives me great pleasure to think about			0
i want to give all of myself , and i do n't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage			0
i have this massive cookbook collection -- close to 3,000 books -- that i 'm not just going to leave or just throw away			0
i have thought about , if i passed away , where would it go			0
i want to donate it to a school			0
with baking , you have to follow the rules			0
i try to be a very good rule player			0
play by the rules and work by the rules			0
the prayer life , the rules that a priest is supposed to live by , that really excites me			1
and being able to help people and minister to people			0
yesterday at @entity62 , one of the readings was about the widow who gave all of what she had			0
i want to emulate her , and i think this is the best way that i can see for me .			0

in his own words , an *executive* chef shares his spiritual *journey* toward the priesthood
drawn to cooking as a child , he spent years at a top - rated @entity0 restaurant
@entity64 and faith have always been with him , he says , as have thoughts of being a priest
at 50 , he 's hung up his apron and entered the seminary , a *logical* move , he *explains*
