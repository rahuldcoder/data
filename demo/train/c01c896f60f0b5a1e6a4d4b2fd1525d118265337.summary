editor 's note : this story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six @entity8 citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group			2
versions of those documents were obtained by @entity13 from the defense attorney of one of those suspects			0
the statement by @entity18 was compiled from an interview he gave @entity8 prosecutors in march 2009 in @entity22 , and was confirmed by @entity24 prosecutors as authentic			1
the statement by @entity26 was given to @entity28 investigators , and was authenticated by @entity8 prosecutors			0
a @entity24 military @entity33 patrols the volatile @entity31 - @entity30 border area earlier this year			0
( @entity13 ) -- when @entity18 spoke at length with @entity8 prosecutors last march , he provided a fascinating and sometimes frightening insight into @entity40 's training -- and its agenda			1
@entity18 is a young @entity24 who was arrested in @entity30 late in 2008 after allegedly training with @entity40 in the @entity31 - @entity30 border area			1
he was repatriated to the @entity24 and in january pled guilty to charges of conspiracy to murder @entity24 nationals , providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization , and receiving military - type training from a foreign terrorist organization			2
in notes made by @entity52 agents of interviews with @entity18 , he admits he went to @entity30 to join @entity40 and kill @entity24 troops in @entity31			1
but the terror group appeared to have other ideas for him			1
he volunteered to become a suicide bomber but was dissuaded at every turn			0
read how @entity40 is now operating on @entity63 weekend last year , shortly after his arrest , much of the @entity22 mass transit system including @entity61 was put on high alert			1
according to the @entity8 prosecutor 's document , @entity18 had told @entity40 's command everything he knew about the system			1
in his interview with @entity8 prosecutors @entity18 stated that he met with several members of a @entity8 - @entity28 group while training in the tribal areas of @entity30			0
one member of this group , a 25 - year - old @entity28 called @entity26 , provided @entity28 interrogators with an account of his time in @entity30 after being arrested on his return to @entity79			0
@entity8 prosecutors told @entity80 has been charged in @entity28 with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act			0
a @entity8 legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by @entity13			0
read how the @entity79 trained with @entity40 @entity18 's and @entity26 's account of their time in @entity40 training camps in @entity30 is a playbook of how the terror group survived after 9/11 and continues to operate in the remote hills of @entity30			1
the documents provide an inside view of @entity40 's organizational structures , training programs , and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective @entity24 missile strikes			1
arguably , they shed more light on the state of @entity40 than any previously released into the public domain			0
the accounts suggest @entity40 has shown remarkable adaptability and remains as committed as ever to launching attacks in the @entity108 , with mass transit a top target			2
they also revealed @entity40 training programs for new forms of attack , including breaking into residences to carry out targeted assassinations			2
read how @entity40 is adapting while intelligence officials say intensified @entity24 strikes using predator drones have degraded @entity40 's capabilities since the end of last year , the accounts suggest that @entity40 has been able to sustain many of its training operations by confining them to small dwellings in the remote mountains of @entity127			1
although not able to operate training camps on anything like the scale they did in @entity31 during the 1990s the wide number of training courses still available to recruits suggests @entity40 still poses a significant threat			2
inside these dwellings bomb - making training appears to have been emphasized , some of it very sophisticated			0
while @entity40 's potential pool of recruits may have shrunk significantly because of a backlash against the terrorist organization in @entity145 communities around the world -- due to its targeting of civilians and the fact that so many of its victims have been @entity145 -- the insider accounts suggest there is still a significant number of hardcore extremists in the @entity108 and in @entity145 countries who are willing to join @entity158 's terrorist outfit			1
what stands out especially from the accounts is the high degree of initiative and perseverance that the @entity165 recruits had to show to join up with jihadist groups in the mountains on the @entity30 - @entity31 border			0
but @entity18 and @entity26 's accounts also suggest that @entity40 may be having leadership problems			2
while able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested it seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures			0
a former @entity24 government official , specializing in counter-terrorism , commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago			0
the only difference , there are fewer of them			0
perhaps those killed or captured are not being replaced			0
recent reports that @entity40 is moving some operatives out of the tribal areas of @entity30 towards safer placements in @entity30 cities , or to jihadist fronts in other countries such as @entity192 and @entity193 , may indicate that the pressure from @entity24 missile strikes is starting to show			1
but the decentralization of @entity40 's training and their ever closer ties with local @entity30 @entity200 , mean it remains extremely difficult to eliminate from the mountains between @entity31 and @entity30			1
above all the accounts from @entity18 and others show that @entity40 's training structures have but one goal , another 9/11			1
read how @entity40 is training for a terror spectacular			2

@entity165 reveal details of life fighting , training with @entity40
an @entity24 says he passed *information* on @entity22 transit to @entity40
they stories tell how the terror group survived and *changed* after 9/11
but it appears @entity40 's training structures have one goal , another 9/11
