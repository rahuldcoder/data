the announcement was made after a meeting of the @entity7 board of directors in @entity11 on saturday			0
" after careful consideration , i have decided that blue clay courts will not be allowed next year			1
i very much believe in innovation and exploring ways to enhance our sport			0

" @entity45 has been a great supporter of the game for many years and i continue to encourage his ideas , including the testing of blue clay at @entity53 events			2
at this time , however , it 's clear that further development is required before it can be considered for use at the @entity7 @entity7 level , " @entity26 said			0

no blue clay for me , " @entity3 said			1
