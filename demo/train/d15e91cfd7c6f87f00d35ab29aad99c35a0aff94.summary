-- the @entity1 on tuesday approved " high - level rules of the road " designed to ensure that internet providers grant everyone equal access to the @entity7			1
but the 3 - 2 vote immediately came under attack from both flanks , with internet - freedom advocates saying the new rules do n't go far enough and critics saying the government should stay out of online business altogether			1
in announcing the proposed rules this month , @entity1 chairman @entity16 said they would require high - speed internet providers to treat all types of web content equally			1
the rules are designed to , in effect , keep the companies that own the internet 's real - world infrastructure from slowing down some types of websites or apps -- say , those belonging to a competitor -- or speeding up others for high - paying clients			1
for average internet users , the vote affects whether government will guarantee they 'll continue to have access to all web content , regardless of their internet provider 's wishes , and whether they 'll get that content as quickly as businesses or individuals able to pay more for it			1
the commission 's agenda said the vote addressed " basic rules of the road to preserve the open internet as a platform for innovation , investment , competition and free expression			1
" web freedom advocates argue the vote does n't do that			0
commissioner @entity57 , a @entity58 , signed off on the rules but called them only a " first step in the right direction			0
" " in my book , today 's action could have , and should have , gone further , " he said			0
" going as far as i would have liked was , however , not in the cards			0
" for example , he said , the rules wo n't absolutely prevent broadband providers from " pay for priority " -- giving faster service to those able to pay for it , or to one favored business over another			1
instead , the regulations say those practices " generally violate " nondiscrimination rules			0
the vote was along party lines , with the commission 's three @entity81 voting to " concur " with the rules and its two republicans voting against them			0
commissioner @entity85 , a @entity86 , called the vote a " radical step " and said it puts the @entity1 " on a collision course " with the courts , which he predicted will throw the rules out			1
" the @entity1 is not @entity92 , " he said			1
" we can not make laws			0
" @entity86 have largely argued the government has no right to interfere with business practices online			0
@entity85 said " nothing is broken in the internet - access market that needs fixing			2
" president @entity102 , in a written statement , called the rules an important part of his administration 's goal of advancing " @entity108 innovation , economic growth and job creation			0
" " today 's decision will help preserve the free and open nature of the internet while encouraging innovation , protecting consumer choice , and defending free speech , " @entity102 said			2
as a candidate , @entity102 pledged to support open - internet policies			1
although the commission approved the rules , @entity92 could still act to amend or weaken them			1
@entity122 and @entity123 , from both sides of the aisle , have expressed concerns for different reasons			0
internet proposal sets off political firestorm lawmakers already are considering legislation that would , in effect , repeal the rules			2
and at least one is threatening to cut off funding to the @entity1 to implement the rules			1
the proposal also does n't set the same set of rules for mobile communications as it does for web - based ones			2
so , the rules protecting information on a home computer might not keep the same data free on a mobile phone			0
sen. @entity147 , a @entity148 @entity58 and one of @entity92 ' most vocal net - neutrality advocates , calls the issue " the most important free - speech issue of our time			1
" in a column monday for @entity156 , @entity147 said some of the current proposal 's language could actually weaken protections			0
" ( @entity161 ) his tuesday , when the @entity1 meets to discuss this badly flawed proposal , i 'll be watching , " he wrote			2
" if they approve it as is , i 'll be outraged			0
and you should be , too			0
" @entity57 , however , said that " if vigilantly and vigorously implemented by the commission -- and if upheld by the courts -- it could represent an important milestone in the ongoing struggle to safeguard the awesome opportunity - creating power of the open internet			2
" @entity16 , the @entity1 chairman argued that currently there are no rules governing internet freedom and that the regulations strike a balance between the two extremes of opinion			1
he also noted they include new rules for mobile that address some critics ' concerns			0
he called the policies " high - level rules of the road " and called internet freedom an ongoing issue for the commission .			2

@entity1 approves open - internet " neutrality " plan , with complaints from both sides
plan is designed to keep *people* who pay from getting better web service than others
@entity92 could still act to amend or weaken rules
