-- @entity1 is down on drugs -- for others			1
for himself , well , it 's a different story			2
the man who infamously told @entity9 during a 2009 interview " i 'm a gangsta , miss @entity7			0
i do n't take nothing from no one			0
i do what i want to do , " has been equally outspoken about his use of " sizzurp " or " purple drank , " a prescription cough syrup made with a combination of promethazine and codeine			0
" @entity27 " has even found its way into @entity1 's song lyrics , and his issues with substance abuse have been well documented			1
@entity28 has several uses , including treating allergy symptoms , easing nausea and as a sedative			0
according to @entity34 , dangerous side effects can include " twitching or uncontrollable movements " of limbs , face , eyes and the tongue			0
of course , rappers talking about drug use is nothing new			2
as is often the case with hip - hop -- which began as a vehicle to document the lives of inner - city youth -- art , more often than not , imitates life			1
but @entity1 's recent hospitalization has cast a spotlight on hip - hop and drug use because of fans ' concerns over his past behavior			1
scant information has been released about what may have caused the award - winning artist , who was born @entity1 , to have a seizure that landed him in a @entity64 hospital			1
his label 's publicist confirmed to @entity0 at the time that the rapper had suffered a seizure			2
@entity1 : i 'm ' more than good ' and what will happen now that he 's out ? talking drug use is one thing			1
but rehab seldom comes up in the conversation			2
" where hip - hop falls short is in addressing the rehabilitation aspect , " said writer @entity77 , who has reported on the industry			1
" @entity1 is one of our hip - hop rock stars , but where is the help for him ? " a big star and his proteges with his monumental success on the charts and devil - may - care attitude , @entity1 has in some ways transcended the male dominated hip - hop genre and occupies the rarefied air of one of music 's biggest stars			1
@entity1 is not only a platinum - selling artist in his own right , but he 's also the man responsible for stars like " @entity100 " judge @entity99 and rapper @entity101			1
he often appears on songs of other artists as diverse as @entity104 and teen heartthrob @entity105			0
he also is one of a number of rappers who have openly discussed drug use			2
in 2011 , he and fellow rap superstar @entity109 discussed their substance abuse issues with @entity112			2
the @entity114 native , who fans also lovingly call " @entity1 , " said he quit narcotics , not necessarily by choice , but partly because it was a requirement of his probation after a 2008 arrest in @entity121 where authorities allegedly found ecstasy in his backpack			1
the rapper secured a plea deal and was given probation			0
" i wish i could be back on it , " he told the publication			0
" that 's how it f * * king feels			2
[ cracking himself up ] ' how does it feel to be sober ? ' i 'll be like , ' it feels f * * * ed up			0
' what do you want me to say ? ' it feels great ' ? no. " the list of those who , like @entity1 , have been accused of drug charges is long -- including the recent arrest of rapper @entity144 who was charged with a felony count of drug possession after police allegedly found suspected meth on him , according to a @entity152 spokesman			1
there has been no information released about how the rapper has pleaded to the charge			0
the rapper 's manager , @entity157 , denied in a statement to @entity0 that @entity144 had drugs on him at the time of his arrest			1
" any assertion that @entity144 was carrying powder is ridiculous ! every rap fan knows @entity144 's into weed ! , " the statement said			2
rapper @entity169 ( now known as @entity169 in homage to the @entity172 culture ) has been a well - known marijuana user			0
@entity175 's reality show " @entity176 " highlighted rapper @entity178 's addiction and relapse after years of sobriety			2
" my two demons are real simple , drugs and depression , " @entity178 told the @entity182 radio show in december			2
" they go hand in hand with one another			0
" such openness about mental health issues -- and the self - medication that illegal drugs can provide -- has historically not always been the case in the african - american culture			1
" the @entity201 community generally has a certain amount of circumspection as it pertains to psychiatry and mental health , and reasonably so , " said dr. @entity197 , host of @entity199 's " dr. @entity198			2
" " ( those medical disciplines ) have ill - served that community historically , and there 's a certain amount of distrust , and you ca n't do this work without absolute trust , " he said			2
" there 's also a lack of embrace of things like 12 - step ( programs ) and the idea that these are long - term propositions to get better from			2
" that historical reticence -- coupled with a life of fame that often finds celebs of all races surrounded by entourages who may not be willing to offer tough love -- can contribute to the issue			0
" there 's also a cultural insulation , " @entity197 said " they do n't want to change , like many addicts and musicians			0
" rap artist @entity235 appeared on @entity197 's show " dr. @entity237 " in 2011 and said he began using drugs at the age of 14 , and the wealth he acquired accelerated his drug use			1
according to @entity244 , the rapper has had dozens of arrests , and as of 2010 they tallied 26 convictions -- 11 felonies and 15 misdemeanors			0
some of those have included drug charges			0
@entity252 , editor - in - chief of @entity253 , told @entity0 that some rappers have now moved well beyond drinking and smoking marijuana			0
@entity252 said he believes " the casual drugs are different now			0
" " now we have pills , now we also have @entity260 ( the crystal or powder form of the drug @entity260 ) , and i would say to the late 2000s , we also had the ecstasy rush , " @entity252 said			0
" so we 're dealing with different levels of drugs that are now being considered recreational , which is a very dangerous situation			0
" a long history in the music business " i can mingle with the stars and throw a party on @entity272 / i am a prisoner , locked up behind @entity274 bars " - @entity1 , " @entity275 " but journalist and @entity278 adjunct professor @entity277 said drugs have long been a problem in the music industry as a whole , not just hip - hop			1
artists referencing drugs goes back as far as jazz star @entity287 's " @entity286 " in 1932 , and use has been well - known on down through rockers like @entity291 and others who suffered overdoses			1
" the whole adage behind ' sex drugs and rock ' n ' roll ' is something that people kind of conveniently forget about , " he said			0
" not to say that it 's right , but in terms of suddenly saying ' well these guys are [ rapping ] about purple syrup ' and overlook the lsd and psychedelic stage in music ... is just ridiculous			1
" @entity277 said the issue of drugs in hip hop is " systemic with an economic incentive to keep it going			1
" " when these artists are on drugs and they are able to do their music or it gives them a certain notoriety , then everybody 's cool with it because it kind of adds to the allure and mystique , " he said			1
" the artists themselves , sure they should take some responsibility , but if they actually have a substance abuse problem , whether they are a drinker or whether they are someone using mind altering substances ... then they actually have a disease that needs to be cured , and i do n't know if you suddenly do that on your own			0
" so then we have to ask questions of the multimillion - dollar record label that they are on : ' why are you putting this out and why are you allowing this to exist ? ' " @entity338 , the senior director for @entity339 -- which is funded by the @entity340 -- has witnessed the addiction struggles of musicians across various genres			0
he 's staged interventions for some			0
there is a stigma in the hip - hop community , @entity345 said , about coming clean and discussing it in a genre that many feel has helped promote drug use			1
" there could be many sober hip - hop artists -- in the community that have gotten sober , or at least more than a few that just do n't talk about it			1
@entity77 , who is also a cast member of the soon - to - debut @entity175 reality show " @entity359 , " which explores the lives of female journalists and bloggers who cover hip - hop , said she worries there may be more of a focus on preserving @entity1 's image			1
helping him , if that 's what he needs , does n't seem to be a priority , she said			0
" there seems to be a lot of concern about @entity1 the business , " she said			1
" but what about @entity1 the person ? " @entity0 's @entity376 , @entity377 and @entity378 contributed to this report .			1
