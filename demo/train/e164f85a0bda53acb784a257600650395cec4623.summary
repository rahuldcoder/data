-- bed has always been a place i ca n't get enough of : the sex ; the sleep ; cozy afternoons reading ; lazy saturday mornings listening to hyper neighbors mow their lawns			1
" i learned that @entity9 really can be interchangeable with @entity10 , if only i 'll let him			1
" after my husband and i had kids , bed also became the object of my dearest fantasies -- the oasis i dreamed about in my late - afternoon stupor , when i knew that many hours still lay between me and the sheets			1
my covetous view of bed changed , however , midway through my third pregnancy , when some suspicious bleeding led my obstetrician to prescribe bed rest for several days , possibly longer			1
" but i have two small kids ! " i protested			1
for those of you more gestationally fortunate , " bed rest " means lying there for hour upon idle hour -- or in the worst cases , week upon idle week -- afraid that even taking a quick shower or reaching for the tv remote might make you lose your baby			1
parenting.com : 71 new - mom truths what would my 4 - year - old son and 2 - year - old daughter do without @entity10 to attend to them every second of their exhausting days ? who could i get to fill my maternal shoes ? our relatives live far away			1
hiring a nanny was financially out of the question			2
the answer , of course , was that the children 's father would have to be their mother ( he runs his own company from home ) , although i must confess i had my doubts			1
@entity56 is a wonderful , involved dad ; he changes diapers , does " this little piggy , " and pitches baseballs equally well -- and equally willingly			2
but @entity56 has always slept straight through 3 a.m. feedings and bad dreams			2
i 'm the chief of childhood minutiae around here ; the one who pours the juice , monitors the wee - wees , and knows what " do the coyote " means ( a dry - eye technique for shampooing hair )			2
on top of being both @entity72 , @entity56 would have to play nurse to me too			1
but -- the biggest , overriding but -- the unborn baby 's health was paramount			2
" get in bed , stay in bed , and do n't worry about a thing , " @entity56 ordered			1
parenting.com : how men change , from lover to husband to father the first few hours went quickly enough			2
there was the novelty of gliding between fresh sheets in the middle of the day and the welcome release from snack doling and bottom wiping			2
" @entity10 's sick , " my husband explained to the kids , closing my door			1
i read straight through one of those books that ordinarily serve as dust catchers			0
with the door closed and the fan whirring , you could n't even tell there were two tots downstairs			0
quiet usually means trouble 's afoot			0
did @entity56 realize this ? " mommy ! @entity10 ! " i heard them cry			0
or did i ? my maternal engines idling nervously , i pictured the kids stoned on @entity111 and @entity112 ; my daughter 's unchanged @entity113 sagging to her knees ; six straight hours of the @entity116 turning their little eyeballs into black - and - white checkerboards			1
darn it , why was it so quiet downstairs ? " mommy ! @entity10 ! " it was the kids , bursting through my bedroom doorway with excited squeals			1
@entity56 had taken them out to dinner and bought each child a toy doctor 's kit			1
they were palpably relieved at being able to take an active part in my scary convalescence			0
@entity135 , they listened to my heartbeat , " tested " my blood pressure , and administered innumerable shots			0
" you must stay in bed ! " admonished the 2 - year - old , wagging a pudgy finger			1
i had to admit that , had the circumstances been reversed , with me filling in for a bedridden @entity56 , i 'd never have thought of something so clever			0
then the object of my admiration appeared			0
" okay , you can get up now , " he said , handing me my robe			0
was he throwing in the towel after just a few hours ? then two young muscle - bound guys materialized in the bedroom and began to remove the saggy , full - size , 10 - year - old mattress on which i had just been lying			0
a few minutes later , they marched back up the stairs brandishing a brand - new , ultra-firm king - size model			0
@entity56 put down new sheets and sent me back to bed			1
wow ! that was n't all			0
my dinner that evening arrived on a tray -- stuffed salmon , baked potato , and broccoli on good china , with a chocolate bar on the side			0
the kids sat with me quietly , impressed and awaiting the chocolate			2
now , i do n't know what the kitchen looked like or exactly how often my daughter 's @entity113 were changed , but for the next several days @entity56 knocked himself out keeping everyone happy			1
he rented six movies for me ( half based on @entity180 novels , half starring @entity181 )			0
he monitored the kids ' frequent visits to give me more " shots " and let them deliver my mail ( from which he 'd removed all the bills , leaving only the juicy catalogs )			2
they went to the park and the zoo			0
blessedly , my bout with bed rest lasted less than a week			1
the bleeding stopped as mysteriously as it had begun , and four and a half months later my baby daughter was born beautiful and perfect			0
but the lessons of the episode linger on today			0
i learned that @entity9 really can be interchangeable with @entity10 , if only i 'll let him			1
and that it takes more than one person to keep a family running -- it 's a minuet among all its members			2
