the pilot of an @entity2 jet that crashed in @entity4 this year told investigators after the accident that he had been " very concerned " about landing without help from an airport navigation system that was out of order			1
capt. @entity10 , who was highly experienced in a @entity11 but was transitioning to flying a 777 , told the @entity12 that he found it " very stressful , very difficult " to land without the glideslope indicator that helps pilots determine whether the plane is too high or too low during approach			1
" asked whether he was concerned about his ability to perform the visual approach while piloting @entity19 , he said ' very concerned , yea , ' " the safety board revealed at a hearing on wednesday on its investigation into the july 6 crash that killed three people and injured more than 180 others			1
the jet struck a sea wall and broke apart on the runway following a missed approach			0
the navigation aid that syncs up with aircraft instruments was out of service while the @entity33 made runway safety improvements			2
but a second , visual lighting system was operable at the time of the daytime crash and the weather was clear			1
the safety board investigation is focusing on whether pilots have become overly reliant on automation to fly commercial planes , and whether basic manual flying skills have eroded			1
investigators have also focused on the pilot understanding -- or misunderstanding -- of the plane 's auto - thrust system , which controls aircraft power			1
automated cockpit systems key to @entity2 probe some of the crew of the @entity2 flight from @entity54 told investigators the auto thrust was always engaged			1
but the safety board has said that system was not engaged , and the jet descended in altitude faster than it should have , and had a slower forward speed than intended			2
the combination put the plane into a perilous situation in the final minute of flight			0
the relief first officer , @entity66 , who was sitting behind @entity10 and instructor pilot @entity67 , said he observed the fast descent -- or sink rate -- and called out the excessive sink rate " more than four times			1
" @entity66 told investigators the pilot appeared to be correcting the " sink rate " and did not advise further changes			1
but its speed was declining at about the same time			0
the plane was flying at 170 knots 73 seconds before impact , dropped below the target speed for landing of 137 knots at roughly 38 seconds before impact , and plummeted as low as 103 knots just seconds before the plane 's front landing gear and tail hit the sea wall at the end of the runway			2
will firefighter be charged after @entity2 crash ? the crew made its first reference to the plane 's speed problem just seven seconds before the crash			2
the pilot called out a " go around " -- a command to abort the landing -- three seconds before impact			2
@entity11 's former chief pilot for the @entity103 program said automated systems are intended to help pilots , but that they still need to exercise diligence			1
" we accept the fact that pilots , as all humans , make errors , " he said			2
automation is intended " as a tool to aid the pilot , not replace the pilot , " he said			0
information released at wednesday 's hearing also showed investigators are concerned about the role @entity120 and airline culture played in the crash			1
@entity66 said the crew practiced " cockpit resource management , " training that encourages subordinates to speak up about safety concerns to other crew members , despite their senior rank , experience or seniority			0
but when @entity10 -- who was considered a student pilot in the 777 -- was asked whether he had contemplated an aborted landing as the plane descended , he said it was a " very hard " decision to make , given the deference shown to superiors in @entity120 culture			0
by the time @entity10 pushed the throttle forward just seconds before impact , he discovered his instructor had already done so			0
three passengers died in the accident -- two in the crash and a third on the ground when hit by a rescue truck responding to the scene			0
the accident was the first fatal commercial airline crash in the @entity151 since february 2009			0
crash survivor @entity152 told @entity153 he was forfeiting an opportunity to watch the proceedings			0
" i think something that i 've done quickly after this plane crash has been to focus on work and family and things that matter to me , " @entity152 said			1
" i 'm extremely happy that something is being done to get to the bottom of what happened that day because it should not have happened			0
" opinion : pilots , not computers , should fly planes			0
