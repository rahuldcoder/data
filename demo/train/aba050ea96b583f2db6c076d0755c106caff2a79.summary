-- the eyes of the world may be on @entity3 with the @entity4 about to kick off but the uncertainty which has engulfed @entity6 since the @entity8 annexation of @entity9 remains			1
and if you believe everything you read , then half the squad of @entity6 's leading club @entity12 is ready to leave the troubled region and head for the top @entity17 leagues			1
but reports of a mass exodus are premature , according to the club 's general manager			1
" nobody wants to leave the club and nobody has asked to leave the club , " @entity22 told @entity0 tuesday			1
" i understand the concerns and i 've had lots of agents on the phone asking me , ' is it safe and will my player be ok ? ' " but i tell them that we can 100 % guarantee the security and safety of the players and their families			2
" i understand that the families of the players are worried but it is fine here			2
" we have not had to give them extra security			0
" tensions remain high in the region although the election of new president @entity48 has provided hope that the political situation may improve			1
the club , which regularly competes in the @entity53 group stages , expects the squad to return to @entity55 on july 26 following a preseason tour -- though contingency plans are in place if the political situation worsens			1
" it is complicated here in @entity6 as everybody knows , " @entity22 added			1
" but we hope we can resolve all the political problems and we 're hopeful over plans to restart the league next season			2
" at the moment , it is calm in @entity55 and there are no real problems			0
" of course , we have talked about contingency plans			0
we could move cities if the problems get worse but we do not expect that to happen			2

the midfielder , who has been included in the country 's @entity4 squad , has reportedly been attracting attention from a number of @entity87 clubs			0
but @entity22 rejected claims the club is under pressure to sell off its prized assets			0
" i 've read everything in the newspapers but there is nothing in it , " he added			0
" we are not under pressure to sell and nobody has requested a move			0
