@entity0 -- there are just times , when you are president of the @entity5 , that formally speaking to the @entity5 people is part of the job			1
not because it 's politically wise , or even politically advisable -- but because you have something important to say			1
as in , the seven - year - combat - mission - in - @entity12 - is - over			0
or , more specifically , as president @entity13 said , " it 's time to turn the page			1
" it was n't a particularly artful speech , nor was it full of new and interesting ideas			2
it was what it was : a ceremonial proclamation ending combat in a war @entity13 inherited ( and opposed ) and a declaration to fight another war ( also , as he says , inherited ) on the economy			1
no talk of winning or victory , only of transitions ( to noncombat mode ) and of a new focus for resources : on investments at home , on fighting @entity37 in @entity38			0
no self - congratulation , only plaudits for the troops			0
the declaration ending combat was clear , but what comes next in @entity12 was completely ambiguous : will a government finally form ? are the @entity12 security forces up to the job ? and if it all falls apart , what do we do ? in many ways , it was an opportunity for the president to remind us of a promise kept			2
fair enough : he said we would leave @entity12 as combatants , and we have			0
he tipped his hat to president @entity58 in an effort to try and finally end the longstanding political divisions over @entity12 ( declaring @entity58 's " love for his country " ) , but stopped short of saying the obvious : @entity58 's surge strategy worked			1
the world can argue over why it worked , but one thing is clear : @entity13 opposed the surge			1
and now he 's employing one in @entity38			2
the pressure to talk about something else other than @entity12 was palpable			0
there 's an election in a couple of months , and it looks like the @entity75 are about to get thumped			2
they 're sitting ducks , in a way , victims of their own success			0
they hold almost every swing congressional seat ; they have incumbents in about 40 districts that @entity87 won			0
unemployment is high ; there 's been no summer of recovery , as some promised			2
the @entity75 are in charge , and voters are ready to throw the bums out			0
so the president had to talk about the economy , i suppose , but it fell flat			1
that 's because there really was n't anything he could tell us that would make voters feel any better			1
he went through the drill , but no one was under any illusion that this @entity109 speech would budge the needle for him -- or the @entity75 -- at this dicey time			0
in a way , it 's more interesting to watch @entity13 now than it was during the campaign			1
back then , he was the great communicator , an inspirational figure promising to take government where it had never been , promising to rescue an electorate sick of partisan divisions and gridlock in the mechanisms of government			0
it was easy to digest because the public was so eager to move on from what it had			2
@entity128 seemed the natural order of things			0
but now , after two years in which the @entity131 has been locked in combat with a @entity134 that found its voice in its almost unanimous opposition to everything -- the stimulus , health care , financial reform -- the campaign call for change seems ancient			1
the president , for all of his success in checking off his to - do list , is now seen as just more of the same by a growing number of voters : a partisan @entity148 addicted to big government and big spending			2
it 's strange , really , that the man who touched so many during the campaign has failed to connect in the same way during his presidency			1
it 's not that we do n't see @entity13 ; we see him more than just about any other president			1
so why is it that we still ca n't figure out who he is ? because a zelig - like devotion to announcing one more agenda item or one more stimulus project or give one more speech just is n't enough			2
visibility does n't guarantee connection			2
that 's where @entity171 comes in			1
there 's no one who was better at empathy			0
and so , as @entity13 and the @entity75 trudge toward an election bound to make them unhappy , the question is this : if @entity13 loses seats ( or even control of the @entity131 ) , who will he be ? will he be @entity171 ( a la 1994 , after losing the @entity131 to @entity182 and the @entity134 ) , adjusting to his new circumstance , working to pass welfare reform and a budget agreement ? or will be @entity186 , who went from bad to worse , sulking with not much to show for it ? granted , if the @entity134 win handily , they 'll have problems of their own : some of the newest members of @entity192 will be virtually unmanageable			1
they 'll vote against every spending bill , not to mention funding the war in @entity38			0
they will have no appetite for compromise at all			0
they will make some @entity134 leaders miserable			0
but @entity13 will be the one to watch , as always			1
the thing about @entity171 is that he knew where to draw a line between the ground he had to yield and the ground he refused to yield			1
and then he got something done			0
about 90 days after the midterm election , we will really know who @entity13 is , and what he 's willing to do			1
he 'll have plenty of time to shape his legacy , and he wo n't need an @entity109 address to point it out			0
we 'll already be watching			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity216 says president @entity13 's *discussion* of economy fell flat
she says the change *message* , which worked well for @entity13 in campaign , is old by now
@entity13 is visible but is n't connecting with public the way @entity171 did , @entity216 says
*key* test for @entity13 will be after midterms as he deals with new @entity192 , she says
