the lead that the presidential candidate of @entity4 ' ruling party has amassed during ballot - counting is " irreversible , " electoral officials said , but refrained from naming an official winner to sunday 's vote			1
the reluctance to definitively declare a winner speaks to the abundance of caution surrounding the electoral system , but also to the political tensions that have accompanied the vote			1
already , two presidential candidates have claimed victory , and a third political party says it has data that suggests it came out on top			1
this was second presidential election ( but the first truly robust one ) since the 2009 coup of former president @entity23 , which ushered in a period of political turmoil			1
with about two - thirds of ballots counted , ruling party candidate @entity26 led with 34 % of the vote , followed by 29 % for @entity31 , who is @entity23 's wife			1
" these percentages , these trends , according to the calculations we have done , have not changed since the first day , " said @entity32 , president of the @entity33			2
" so , today , we can tell the @entity4 people that the final results will be the same as what we have today			2
" @entity32 called @entity26 's lead ' irreversible			1
" @entity44 's camp did not immediately comment on these latest results			2
traditionally , @entity4 has had a two - party system , alternating the presidency , but this year 's ballot had eight candidates for president , half of whom were contenders			0
following her husband 's ouster from office , @entity44 founded the @entity58 and @entity59 ( @entity60 ) on a platform that carried on her husband 's projects and found herself at the top of some polls			0
a victory by @entity44 would have been a remarkable comeback for @entity23 back to the presidential palace , even as a first husband			0
in a race where the economy and public security were among the most important issues for voters , the final polls before the election showed a statistical tie between @entity26 and @entity44			1
sunday night , both leading candidates claimed victory : @entity44 announced her win on live television , while @entity26 did so on @entity84			1
@entity60 said earlier it does not recognize the preliminary results			0
" to us , this does not reflect reality			0
there inconsistencies that have been detected , irregularities that have been found , we are collecting these , " a party spokesman said tuesday			0
a third leading party , the @entity93 , also rejected the results , saying that hundreds of ballots are missing at that their own calculations show their party winning 26 % of the vote to 25 % of the vote for the other two leading contenders			1
' there has to be order ' with the inevitable confirmation of @entity26 as president - elect , all eyes are on the opposition parties and how they will react			1
in an interview with @entity108 en @entity109 , @entity26 said that he has publicly invited @entity44 and the other candidates to dialogue about moving forward in a way that avoids conflict			1
" there has to be order in the country , " @entity26 said			1
" there has to be respect and tolerance in the country , those are the rules			0
" the voter turnout , at more than 60 % , was an encouraging sign in a country where faith in democracy has been thin at times			0
the country remains one of the poorest in the hemisphere and has one of the world 's highest murder rates			0
given these challenges , observers hope that political upheaval is added to the mix. if @entity44 does not concede , the alternative might be to allege fraud and to appeal the election through the electoral tribunal			1
reports on whether sunday 's vote was free and fair are mixed			1
" what we can say at this moment is that sunday 's election was very transparent , " said @entity144 , @entity4 director of the @entity145 , a non-governmental organization			0
there were some irregularities , like in any election , he said , but nothing that could affect the results of the vote			1
observers from the @entity158 said tuesday that the electoral process had been clean			2
" the mission considers it important to emphasize that there were elements that contributed to the transparency of the process and therefore , give reliability to the preliminary results reported so far by the @entity33 , " observer @entity160 told reporters			0
one international observer , @entity170 of @entity171 in @entity172 , said she had recorded a number of irregularities			0
at one hotel where observers were staying , masked men with shirts labeled " immigration " emptied the place and checked everyone 's identification , she said			0
" it had an effect on the observers because it was an act of intimidation , " she said			0
she said she also heard reports of immigration agents questioning the credentials of observers working for the opposition parties			0
the @entity192 , which was criticized for being slow to condemn the 2009 coup , said in a statement that observers found the elections " generally transparent			2
" " the @entity192 calls on @entity4 to await the completion of the counting of official results and to resolve election disputes peacefully through established legal processes , " the @entity197 said			2
the potential for unrest and a showdown between presidential candidates has some observers upset			0
" the @entity4 citizenry has shown itself to be a first - rate citizenry , with second - rate politicians , " political analyst @entity208 said .			2

electoral officials say that @entity26 is ahead in the vote count
his lead at this point is " irreversible , " one says
but @entity26 has not yet been named the official winner
political tensions have accompanied these elections
