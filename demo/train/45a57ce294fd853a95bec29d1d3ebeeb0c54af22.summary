-- a couple weeks after attending his first @entity3 meeting as president , @entity1 was awarded the @entity5			1
what a difference three years makes			2
back in his first months in office , simply being @entity1 was enough to bring cheering crowds into the street			1
whether it was because he was not @entity12 or because he was promising to end @entity14 policies that were widely despised or whether it was because -- as the first @entity17 to be elected @entity14 president , he embodied an ideal of opportunity for all that was core to this country 's appeal -- it hardly mattered			2
convene a crowd , and they would find something to like about @entity1			1
back then , he seized the moment with great speeches that offered a vision for a new era in @entity14 leadership			2
in @entity33 , he spoke of new relations with the @entity36 world			1
in @entity37 , he spoke of eliminating nuclear weapons			2
he embraced the @entity39 as a mechanism of coordinating the response to the global economic crisis			2
indeed , @entity1 is probably the first person ever to be awarded the @entity5 largely for his charm			1
or , alternatively , he may be the first person ever to have won the @entity5 for the simple achievement of not having been the guy who had the job before him			0
( this can be an important achievement			0
former @entity14 commerce secretary @entity49 once said one of the secrets to job success is picking the right predecessor			0
) opinion : why you should n't vote for @entity1 it was a great start			1
but the problem with great speeches of the kind @entity1 delivered then is that they contain promises , and if those promises are not kept future speeches not only ring hollow , they are reminders of what has not been fulfilled			1
as president @entity1 prepared to deliver his remarks tuesday to the @entity3 , the world that had been so supportive had turned less receptive			1
the echoes of his @entity33 speech seemed very faint indeed as neither @entity1 nor @entity70 , @entity71 's new president , seemed to know how to characterize the @entity14 relationship with that country , once an important ally in the region			1
further , the hope for a new relationship with @entity36 seemed deeply damaged in the wake of recent @entity80 protests and the killings in @entity82 , @entity83			1
the @entity37 speech 's promise of a world without nuclear weapons was predicated on the idea that the world 's two most important nuclear powers , the @entity14 and @entity91 , would move to a more constructive relationship			1
the relationship is deeply strained			2
and the threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons to @entity98 was a central subject of the president 's remarks			0
he said such a threat could not be contained and therefore the @entity14 would not tolerate it arising			0
but clearly , the question mark associated with past unkept promises hung in the air over that firmly delivered assertion			0
@entity1 was awarded the @entity5 on the assumption that he would be the president who got the @entity14 out of the wars in the greater @entity110 that had cause so much dissent during the @entity12 presidency			1
but @entity1 subsequently chose to increase the @entity14 troop presence in @entity114			1
he serially violated national borders with special operations missions , drones and cyber-attacks			0
he changed @entity14 doctrine but seemed to continue to embrace a " we 'll do what we choose " @entity14 exceptionalism			0
the notion that the @entity110 is itself somehow more peaceful today than it was when he received that prize is ludicrous			1
the @entity14 has turned away from the @entity39 as the primary mechanism of global economic cooperation			0
indeed , the president has turned away from the @entity3 for campaign purposes , stopping only for a speech and campaign press appearances , not to meet with international leaders			1
it would be wrong to suggest that president @entity1 is solely responsible for these developments			1
he could no more control the @entity135 street than he could the behind - the - scenes machinations of a tin - pot thug like @entity138			0
he has racked up some considerable foreign policy achievements as well			0
@entity14 is out of @entity140			0
the @entity14 economy is slowly turning a corner			0
and the president has been blessed with an adversary in this campaign who responds to every potential crisis for the president with a bigger self - inflicted crisis for his own campaign			0
indeed , it sometimes seems that the @entity154 would be better running with no candidate at all than the one they have got			0
opinion : the true difference between @entity1 , @entity160 speaking to the @entity3 , president @entity1 tried to evoke the strength and promise of that first year			1
his language was soaring and his themes were resonant			0
he evoked the kind of understanding for international perspectives that were signatures of that first year in office			0
of the costs to the @entity110 of intolerance			2
of the strength of @entity14 values like free speech and government for , by and of the people			0
it was apparent once again that this was a compassionate president and a man of good values			0
but for every strong assertion that echoed through the hall , the echoes of three years of past speeches added a question : are good values enough ? can this president , any president , any man or woman , deliver the results that would have warranted that premature prize @entity1 was awarded in 2009 ? was it not so much an award to a man as it was to an idea of the leadership we have ever since needed but have yet to find ? @entity1 right now has his sights clearly set on the challenge of winning the november election			1
but for him , that is a far smaller hurdle than what awaits if he wins : one last chance to live up to the hope that ushered him into office , one last chance to earn the prize he has already won			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity207 : in 2009 , @entity1 got @entity209 *shortly* after his first @entity3
he says back then , world saw him as leader to end wars , which proved too hard to do
he says no end in sight for *turmoil* in @entity110 , relationship with @entity36 damaged
@entity207 : @entity1 *focused* on election , but greater challenges await if he wins
