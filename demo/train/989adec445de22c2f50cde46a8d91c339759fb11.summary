@entity2 tanks on the move near the border town of @entity11 in @entity13 province , southeastern @entity2			0
at least 24 suspected @entity6 militants were killed , the @entity2 military reported , adding it suffered 5 casualties			1
the incursion against the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) in @entity7 began around 7 p.m. thursday			2
in a statement , the @entity2 military said it would act with " utmost sensitivity in order to avoid negative impact on local elements " -- a reference to keeping civilians out of the conflict			2
" the @entity27 , which values @entity7 's territorial integrity and its stability , will return as soon as planned goals are achieved , " the military said			0
" the executed operation will prevent the region from being a permanent and safe base for the terrorists and will contribute to @entity7 's stability and internal peace			0
" @entity2 has been taking cross-border military action , including airstrikes and artillery shelling , against the @entity17 in retaliation to attacks by the group on targets in @entity2 from bases in the @entity6 region of northern @entity7			1
the @entity17 has spent two decades fighting for autonomy for @entity6 in southeastern @entity2			1
@entity2 has also been carrying out small ground operations into @entity7 , forays characterized as " hot pursuit " incursions with a few hundred commandos responding to a particular threat			2
citing @entity2 media reports estimating that as many as 10,000 @entity2 troops had been involved , @entity53 , an analyst with @entity55 military thinktank @entity54 , said the operation was the first major incursion by @entity2 into @entity7 since @entity60 was toppled in 2003			1
@entity53 said the @entity2 military wanted to conduct a surprise attack against the @entity17 prior to the springtime , when violent attacks tend to escalate , and when the snow in the mountainous border region leaves the fighters ' footprints			1
" normally during the 1980s and the 1990s , the incursions involved 35,000 50,000 troops and they tended to be somewhat open - ended over weeks			0
this one is expected to be limited to a matter of days and targeted attacks against the @entity17 , " he said			2
@entity75 officials were downplaying the scope of the operation friday			0
@entity78 , deputy @entity79 spokesman , said @entity7 foreign ministry @entity80 called the incursion " limited in nature " and not " major			2
" " the @entity17 is a common enemy of the @entity75 , @entity2 and @entity7			1
we need to work together to resolve it , " @entity78 said			0
" we are pleased that @entity2 have stressed that they will do everything possible to avoid acts that would harm civilians			0
" rear adm. @entity90 , a spokesman for the @entity75 military in @entity7 , told @entity0 the military is " aware " of a @entity2 " operation of limited duration to specifically target @entity17 terrorists in that region			1
" " @entity2 has given its assurances it will do everything possible to avoid collateral damage to innocent civilians or @entity6 infrastructure , " @entity90 said			0
the ground troops ' deployment followed cross-border shelling early thursday by @entity2 soldiers into abandoned villages north of @entity106 -- the capital of @entity7 's @entity108			2
the shelling , which struck abandoned villages in the @entity112 north of @entity106 , lasted two hours and was followed by heavy gunfire , a @entity108 official told @entity0			0
there were no reports of casualties			0
border tensions have been a source of diplomatic disagreement between the @entity120 , @entity121 and its @entity7 and @entity2 allies			0
@entity75 and @entity7 authorities have been concerned that any large - scale operation by @entity2 into @entity7 to chase down @entity6 rebels could destabilize the region			1
at the same time , the @entity75 backs @entity2 's efforts to battle the @entity17 , which both countries regard as a terrorist group and has been providing intelligence to the @entity2			1
" the @entity75 continues to support @entity2 's right to defend itself from the terrorist activities of the @entity17 and has encouraged @entity2 to use all available means , to include diplomacy and close coordination with the @entity136 to ultimately resolve this issue , " @entity90 said			1
