stereotypes of @entity2 cuisine inevitably feature visions of streaky bacon and swirly pastries			2
but trail - blazing restaurants like the two @entity8 - starred " @entity7 " have ushered in a fashion for so - called " @entity10 " that has seen bon vivants straining their vocal chords in songs of praise			1
@entity14 , the stylish @entity2 capital , is leading the way in this @entity17 culinary revolution			1
indeed , the latest edition of the @entity19 awarded the city 's restaurants an impressive 14 stars -- more than any other of its @entity25 counterparts			1
but the city is also dotted with eateries for all occasions and tastes , offering more than just @entity8 starred fine dining			1
here is @entity34 's at - a - glance guide to @entity36 's new culinary capital			1
@entity37 a foraged feast @entity7 is hidden inside an 18th - century storage building that was once used to keep salt			1
facing out onto the quiet waterways of @entity43 , it 's an unassuming location for a two @entity8 star restaurant , regularly touted by industry experts as the best in the world today			1
@entity48 , founder and head chef , has been wowing foodies ever since @entity7 's relatively recent emergence , with his extraordinary emphasis on local and foraged food , showcasing the cuisine of the cold @entity55			1
" vegetables in soil " offers perhaps the most illustrative and notorious example of @entity60 's agrarian - focused philosophy			1
locally sourced baby carrots , radishes , leeks and celeriac are served on a bed of " soil " , which is in fact a combination of malt flour , hazelnut flour , melted butter and beer			2
@entity7 's interior echoes this earthy outlook			1
rustic wooden beams extend between the white - washed walls , and food is served on bare dark oak tables			1
those with time on their hands should opt for the 12 - course " @entity84 " taster menu			2
the four - hour degustation begins with a platter of sea - buckthorn with pickled rose - hip petal , and culminates in a @entity90 artichoke sorbet with apple , shortbread and chocolate discs , taking in a cosmic array of @entity96 delights in between			2

the interior is a sugary feast for the eyes			0
ornate chandeliers hang from ceilings plastered with psychedelic wallpaper , and the long , slender room is adorned with curiosities that range from the sublime to the ridiculous , in a brand of décor the café calls " funky baroque			0
" created in collaboration with design legends like furniture company @entity126 , architectural firm @entity127 and sound specialists @entity129 , the café is a testament quintessentially @entity2 design			0
aside from a delightful selection of salads , pastries and hot chocolates , the @entity104 is best known for its modern take on traditional smørrebrød -- the famous @entity2 open sandwich typically adorned with meat or cheese			0
here though , proprietor @entity140 has added an east @entity142 dimension : sushi			0
the result is the endearingly termed " @entity145 " -- colourful bite - sized sandwiches piled high with a selection of fish and vegetables			2
@entity150 cheap eats readers of @entity2 newspaper @entity152 were recently asked to select their favourite @entity14 eating establishment			1
the locals voted overwhelmingly in favor of the " @entity158 " ( @entity159 ) -- a humble hot dog stand			0
while the city is riddled with white vans peddling fairly predictable low - grade sausage and bun combos , @entity159 's owner @entity161 has set his heart on introducing a better breed of fast food			1
everything is organic , from the star attraction of grilled pork sausage to the remoulade and fried onions			0
the buns are made from slow - fermented sourdough bread and linseed -- the sort of thoughtful detail that explains why @entity159 has so quickly become the people 's champ			2
@entity183 sea food fanciers in this fish - focused eatery , the main courses salute the unsung heroes of the @entity188 , with often neglected specimens such as dab and whiting on the menu			1
ordinarily hum - drum dishes are given a " @entity10 " - style twist			1
the fish and chips , for example , are made from fresh and zealously sourced haddock that is lightly smoked before frying , then cheekily served in the traditional newspaper cone			0
the décor features the mesmerizing centrepiece of a cylindrical jellyfish tank and decorative meat hooks hang from the ceiling			0
the latter are a homage to @entity209 's location in the former @entity210 ( @entity211 )			0
as is so often the case with formerly dilapidated industrial quarters , the area has become excruciatingly cool , so book in advance or face a long wait			0
@entity218 & @entity219 for garden enthusiasts situated in the @entity222 gardens , on grounds run by the @entity224 , @entity218 & @entity219 infuses fine dining with prime horticulture to create a truly multi-sensory experience			0
@entity229 textiles bring the encircling garden inside , as does a gently immersive soundscape that mimics the noise of forest creatures			0
all the while , shards of light dance on crystals hanging from the ceiling			0
the inventive kitchen pairs rare ingredients from around the world			0
foie gras positioned on top of a " bark " made of bull kelp from @entity246 and a dessert of deconstructed berries , lavender ice cream , " spherified " ( gelled ) ruccula and apricot , and fresh clovers is a dish indicative of @entity218 & @entity219 's blend of humor and haute cuisine .			0

@entity14 is at the heart of the wave of " @entity10 "
restaurants like two @entity8 - starred " @entity7 " have put @entity262 food on the *map*
