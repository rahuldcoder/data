-- what would you do if you ran into a future version of yourself ? for author @entity7 , " when it happens , this is what happens : i shoot myself			1
" not , you know , my self self			0
i shoot my future self			1
he steps out of a time machine , introduces himself as @entity7			1
what else am i supposed to do ? i kill him			0
i kill my own future , " he said			2
this is the dilemma posed in @entity7 's debut novel , " how to live safely in a @entity19			1
" @entity7 's genre - defying story of time travel is receiving critical praise for being a quirky mix of string theory , " a @entity25 " and @entity26			1
@entity7 's appearance at this summer 's @entity28 won him a slew of new fans and generated buzz for the book			1
" how to live safely in a @entity19 " features a down - on - his - luck time machine repairman , living in @entity34 31			1
it 's an alternate reality similar to our own			2
he 's got a crush on his computer operating system , named @entity41 , and has the great misfortune of getting stuck in a time loop			1
underneath the science fiction , the story deals with a slightly dysfunctional family and their attempts to reconnect with one another			1
@entity0 recently asked @entity7 about his book and this often - debated science fiction " what - if ? " @entity0 : so this is not your typical time travel story			1
yu : the book , although sometimes lighthearted , also tries to take on heavier subjects			2
i wanted to look at how a family is a kind of four - dimensional system , a system not of physical forces but emotional forces , like memory and regret , and how , over time , a family creates its own story of itself			1
at its core , this is a story of a marriage and of a father - son relationship			2
i wanted to ask some of the age - old questions about time and identity and self , but i wanted to articulate those questions in new ways			1
@entity0 : in a sense , your book is something of a time machine			1
yu : i 've always thought of a novel , just the idea of what a novel is , as an amazing technology			0
i wanted to play around with the idea of a novel as a time machine			1
so it really started with the time machine itself , the @entity94 , and the guy inside of it , a time travel technician			1
the time machine is a small , shower - sized box inside of a bigger box , @entity34 31			1
with both boxes , i wanted to evoke a place that feels as much psychological as it does physical			2
in terms of the plot , the main character is stuck in a time loop ( as a result of his having done something very dumb )			1
so he 's stuck in this box , stuck in a time loop , stuck between the past and the present , unable to move on with his life			1
@entity0 : this is a book sci - fi geeks will love , but you do n't have to be a fanboy to enjoy			1
yu : i do love science , and so researching ideas and concepts that i could play around with in the book was certainly fun			1
and there were moments that felt like discovery , like i had stumbled into a real place in @entity129 , and i was exploring and creating simultaneously			0
those fun moments were fleeting , though			0
for the most part , writing it was hard , as it always is for me			0
@entity134 said , " a writer is a person for whom writing is more difficult than it is for other people			0
" i might even go further and say that a writer is a person for whom writing is slightly more painful than bleeding from the ear			0
@entity0 : the main character in the novel is also named @entity7			1
is he similar or different from the real you ? yu : despite the fact that i named the character after myself , there 's really not a lot that is autobiographical in the book , at least in terms of events or other seemingly factual details			1
if there is a commonality , it 's that i have always been very close to my family , and as a result , i have tried to pay attention to the complicated dynamics inside a family , the stresses and strains that any family goes through			2
@entity0 : what writers influenced you ? yu : i have always admired @entity26 , @entity167 , @entity168 , just to name a few			0
one book i go back to a lot is " six walks in the @entity172 , " which is a series of lectures that @entity175 gave			2
he breaks open the black box of narrative and shows you how it works , the magic and technology inside a story			0
in some ways , though , comic books and video games have influenced me , too , especially the latter			0
a video game is an environment where there are rules and constraints , where the laws of classical mechanics may or may not apply , but even if they do n't , there are underlying forces and logic and consistency			0
in writing " how to live safely , " i tried to create some of the same feel , of this environment , this minor universe where the main character felt constrained in some ways , yet unnervingly free in other ways , as if he realized he was trapped in a story , and yet at the same time he was creating the story through his choices			2
@entity0 : you are an award - winning young writer , a lawyer , and you have a family			2
how do you find time to keep up with everything ? yu : my wife was very supportive , and my kids are good sleepers ! those were the keys			0
i wrote " how to @entity217 " in two - and three - hour chunks at nights and on weekends			0
there were plenty of nights where i fell asleep at the keyboard			0
i 'd wake up with a second - degree burn on my legs from my computer overheating on me			0
@entity0 : you were a big hit at @entity28			2
yu : it was my first time , and i really enjoyed it			0
my publisher , @entity230 , made all of these cool stickers and posters and flyers , and they also made a completely metal version of the novel			0
i really enjoyed talking to so many fans of science fiction and of stories in general			1
because that 's really what @entity28 is , and i never really thought about it before , but it 's this four - day extravaganza that is fueled by the passion people have for fictional worlds of all kinds			1
@entity0 : what 's next ? are you working on a new novel ? yu : yes , definitely working on a new novel			0
in addition to that , i 'm also excited about another idea i have been developing , which i hope will work as a serial and / or comic book			0
it 's sort of spun - out of the universe of " how to @entity217 , " not really in terms of the main story or characters , but out of a concept from that universe			2
@entity0 : could we see " how to live safely in a @entity19 , " the movie ? if so , who would you want to play you ? yu : i would love to see it			0
it 'd be exciting to see how someone else would visualize such a self - referential , conceptual world			0
i mean , it 's literally a metaphor - driven time travel device			1
it 'd be very cool to see my own brother , @entity274 , who is an actor , because i think he 'd do a great job			0
then again , maybe he 'd do too good a job , and it would be too close for comfort			0
in which case , i 'll just say @entity280			0
is that too weirdly specific ? he 's just good in everything			0
@entity0 : any words of wisdom ? yu : if you ever find yourself face to face with a future version of yourself , do n't shoot ! you may regret it .			2
