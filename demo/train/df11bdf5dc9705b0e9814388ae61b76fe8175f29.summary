@entity0 -- in mid-october , political pundits wondered how @entity3 could have put their sizable majority in jeopardy by forcing a government shutdown			0
polls showed @entity8 getting most of the blame for the shutdown and @entity11 taking a lead in generic match ups against @entity15 congressional candidates			1
but those gains were quickly wiped away by the disastrous roll out of president @entity19 's signature health care law			2
within weeks , @entity11 were panicking that their support of @entity21 could cost them their @entity23 majority and risk losing more @entity3 seats			1
@entity3 @entity11 campaign chief rep. @entity25 of @entity26 shrugged off @entity15 declarations that the new health care law 's failures spelled doom for @entity11 in the midterms , telling @entity1 in an interview , " if @entity8 are going to run on rooting for failure , then so be it			1
" instead @entity41 insists @entity8 owned the shutdown and " 2014 will not be referendum on the president , it 's a referendum on whether you want to elect a @entity37 who will continue to do damage , it 's about a do - nothing or do - damage @entity40			1
" poll suggests @entity21 could have cost @entity19 second term @entity15 confident @entity21 will continue to hurt @entity11 in midterms @entity48 rep. @entity48 , who heads the effort to recruit @entity15 candidates to unseat @entity11 and expand the @entity3 @entity15 majority , told @entity1 any blowback from the " brief moment " of shutdown in october will " melt away " but health care problems will persist			1
@entity21 will still be painful six months from now and a year from now , " he said			2
@entity3 @entity11 need to pick up 17 @entity58 seats to win back the majority in the @entity3			1
but they also need to protect a list of roughly two dozen incumbent democrats who represent red - leaning and purple districts			0
@entity15 members say while @entity19 is n't on the ballot , he remains a major factor in the midterms			2
the president 's record low poll numbers and questions about his credibility after failing to follow through on a key promise about his health care plan are causing a drag on @entity11 incumbents and challengers			2
some already compare this midterm and @entity21 to the one that cost the @entity3 their @entity3 majority in 2006 , when then - president @entity82 faced questions about his handling of @entity85 and the unpopular @entity87 war pulled down his approval ratings			2
" president @entity19 is very close to the low point of where president @entity82 was , " rep. @entity89 , chair of @entity90 , told reporters last week			0
" those of us who were here in those days remember how it felt going into the ' 06 election and it was n't good			0
" poll : voters split over @entity11 , @entity8 in 2014 the @entity3 @entity15 midterm playbook is a straightforward one -- highlight the problems with @entity21 and its economic impact			1
@entity89 says for now congressional republicans do n't need to supply an alternative health care plan of their own because the @entity11 - led @entity23 and the @entity107 would never consider a @entity15 proposal			1
while a group of 39 @entity3 @entity11 sought to put distance between themselves and the president last week by backing a @entity3 @entity15 bill that allows insurers to offer current health care policies for another year , @entity3 @entity11 leaders continue to stress @entity21 will turn out to be a net positive for the party by next fall			1
" democrats stand tall in support of the @entity21			2
" @entity121 @entity120 said in an interview with @entity123 on sunday			0
@entity120 defends @entity21 claims , ca n't predict effect on @entity126 in midterms the @entity128 distributed a memo this week using examples of @entity15 candidates like @entity132 and @entity134 gubernatorial candidate @entity133 who ran against @entity21 and lost			1
the memo concluded , " while @entity8 are campaigning to bring back a broken health care system , @entity11 will be campaigning on @entity21			1
" for those new @entity11 candidates who were n't in @entity0 when @entity21 was passed , @entity41 says he advises new candidates to run as " problem - solvers , running on solutions			1
" and he points to internal polling across competitive districts that shows that voters prefer a candidate who wants to " fix and improve " @entity21 rather than one who vows to " repeal and defund " the law 55 % -40 %			2
but a new @entity152 / @entity151 poll out on tuesday found that four in 10 @entity153 were more likely to oppose a candidate who backed the law , and only about one - fifth saying they are likely to vote for a politician who supports the law			0
@entity48 points to @entity3 @entity37 challengers who have personal experiences with the new health care law , saying they will work tirelessly to link @entity11 to it			2
@entity163 , who oversees 6,000 employees in his family 's business in northeastern @entity167 , is a top @entity15 recruit running against @entity11 rep @entity168			1
he talks about his company 's health care costs and highlights his opposition to @entity21 as a key reason for entering the race			0
@entity8 believe several candidates who narrowly lost to @entity11 in 2012 in competitive districts in @entity176 , @entity177 , and @entity178 will prevail in rematches in 2014 because this time @entity3 @entity11 wo n't have the help of a presidential ticket boosting turnout			1
@entity3 @entity11 say @entity15 record of dysfunction will cost them seats the focus now is squarely on @entity21 , but democrats believe the political debate will move into better territory for them as attention returns to fiscal fights on @entity193			1
the short - term deal to reopen the government created a mid-december target for @entity40 to agree to a budget , and a january deadline for funding the government			0
the @entity201 's borrowing authority runs out in mid-february			0
@entity126 cool down after @entity21 meeting the number two @entity3 @entity203 complained on tuesday that @entity206 chairman rep. @entity205 , @entity207 , and other congressional @entity8 were n't serious about budget negotiations , and warned the government could again be facing a shutdown			1
" @entity205 ought to lead , not follow his caucus down a road , which would lead to shutdown			0
that would be irresponsible and harmful and i hope he does n't do that , " rep @entity214 told reporters on tuesday			0
the @entity219 believes the shutdown was a recruiting bonanza for them , and helped contribute to some recent @entity15 retirements			2
@entity41 points to eight @entity15 seats that were put in play directly because of the extended standoff			0
@entity228 councilman @entity227 jumped in the race against @entity15 rep. @entity230 after @entity230 said he needed his government paycheck to afford his home			0
on his campaign website , @entity227 positions himself as an outsider : " i am running for @entity40 to help change a dysfunctional @entity0			0
the time has come for moderate minds and respectful leaders to work together			0
" @entity11 also say @entity8 ' lack of diversity and inability to reach out beyond their base -- a major factor in their national loss in 2012 -- will also hurt their chances to make inroads in @entity11 districts in 2014			1
" the movement is underway and it takes time , " @entity48 admitted			0
but he pointed to @entity15 candidate @entity249 in @entity250 , who is challenging @entity11 rep. @entity251			1
@entity249 is openly gay and backed by the @entity3 @entity15 campaign arm			0
seven keys to the 2014 midterms			0

@entity11 gains brought on by shutdown wiped away by @entity21 *fiasco*
@entity8 believe shutdown fallout will fade , but @entity21 problems will persist
@entity11 believe sentiment will *swing* back to them in fiscal fights ahead with @entity15
