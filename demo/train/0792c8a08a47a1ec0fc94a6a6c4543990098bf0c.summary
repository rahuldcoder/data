sure , @entity1 's government despises the movie " @entity3			1
" but when its propagandists say it did not hack @entity8 before the original release date of the flick that satirizes dictator @entity11 , they might just be telling the truth			1
some @entity14 cyber experts say the evidence the @entity16 has presented to attempt to incriminate hackers working for the communist regime is not enough to pin the blame on @entity20			2
" it 's clear to us , based on both forensic and other evidence we 've collected , that unequivocally they are not responsible for orchestrating or initiating the attack on @entity8 , " said @entity21 , who runs the cybersecurity company @entity22			1
the @entity16 has said that code in the malware used by a group called " @entity31 " ( @entity30 ) in the attack on @entity8 is similar to code used by @entity1 in other attacks			1
but that code was leaked a long time ago , experts say			1
any hacker anywhere in the world could have used it			0
there is a group in the @entity11 regime that is responsible for cyber warfare , but independent it security researcher @entity43 does n't believe @entity1 was capable of the @entity8 hack			1
" it 's beyond the skill level that we have been able to observe , " he said			0
@entity49 has reached out to the @entity16 for comment on the doubts about @entity1 's involvement in the @entity8 hack , but has not heard back			1
earlier this month , @entity14 officials told @entity49 on condition of anonymity that the @entity56 and @entity16 were able to trace the attack back to @entity1			1
a whodunit so , @entity1 might not have done it			2
but if not , who did ? @entity8 may be a bur in @entity20 's fur for the movie , in which an actor playing @entity11 is confronted by the protagonist with @entity1 's human rights record			1
in the end , they do bloody battle			0
but @entity8 has other enemies -- both internal and external			2
one example could be the group that says it launched a cyberattack on christmas day against @entity8 's @entity73			2
the @entity74 has claimed responsibility for knocking @entity73 gamers offline and said it had also done the same with @entity78 's @entity77			0
in the summer , it also smacked game networks @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
but after @entity84 acknowledged large - scale attacks on @entity86 this summer , the @entity83 appear to have gotten particularly nasty with them			0
bomb threat a tweet sent from an account in the hackers ' name alleged there was a bomb on board a plane carrying @entity84 president , @entity97			0
the lizards also claimed responsibility for a @entity73 outage early this month , just days after the big @entity8 hack that plundered a record - worthy 100 terabytes of data			1
it included movies , company secrets , employee data , embarrassing internal emails and @entity110 numbers of celebrities			0
then there are @entity8 's internal rubs : security employees have been hit by layoffs			2
a disgruntled former longtime employee code - named " @entity117 " has ties to @entity30 , @entity21 said			0
and she had high access to company secrets and user data			0
there 's a possibility these were n't hacked away from @entity8 but given away instead			2
" @entity117 " was probably mad about layoffs , @entity21 said , but she may have also commiserated with people who pirated @entity8 movies and other content " and how they had been prosecuted in the @entity14 and other countries			1
" @entity49 asked @entity8 about @entity21 ' account on " @entity117 " but has received no reply			2
deja vu there are myriad other possibilities			0
there are hackers for hire			0
or -- like that leaked @entity1 code -- lots of malware is available through the @entity144			1
@entity145 can augment off - the - shelf viruses with customized components			0
also , @entity8 is a broad target that plenty of hackers have taken shots at in the past			1
in october 2012 , the hacker group " @entity154 " released a security key that allowed @entity157 users to run pirated games			0
and in april 2011 , @entity8 's @entity73 was shut down for nearly a month when hackers stole the personal information of an estimated 77 million people			1
a 19 - year - old @entity162 , allegedly a member of a hacking group called @entity164 , was arrested over that one			0
that same year , in june , hackers released 150,000 @entity8 records , including user names and passwords , and claimed to have compromised the private information of more than 1 million people			1
this month 's hack was a reprise of that one for critics and for some employees planning to sue the company for failing to protect their privacy .			0

" unequivocally , they are not responsible , " a cybersecurity expert says about @entity1
malware in the @entity8 hack may have originated in @entity1 but leaked a long time ago
hackers have often taken shots at @entity8
in 2011 , hackers stole the data of an estimated 77 million people
