-- it was the first win in three @entity3 qualifying games for the mighty @entity4 but another unconvincing performance by @entity4 against the minnows of @entity7 friday			1
the @entity9 winner was expected to at least match the seven goals that both @entity11 and @entity12 had put past @entity7 in their last two @entity13 matches , but only managed four			0
perhaps suffering a hangover from its @entity16 triumph , defeats to @entity11 and a draw against the @entity12 , have left @entity4 in third place in the group			0
@entity7 , who only became a full @entity22 member last year and are not recognized by @entity23 , have only one full - time professional in its lineup , @entity26 from third - flight @entity28 side @entity27			2
but it put on a battling performance against a near full strength team picked by @entity4 coach @entity33 and deployed in an attacking 3 - 5 - 2 formation			2
@entity9 hero @entity35 started the scoring and added a second , while fellow @entity39 star @entity38 was also on the score sheet before half time			0
the expected goal glut after the break did not materialize with the occasional jeer ringing around the stadium in @entity45			0
the fourth , and only goal of the half , came on 67 minutes when @entity49 's cross was turned into his own net by visiting defender @entity51			0
" i am anything but happy , the team did n't measure up the way we had wished , " @entity33 told reporters after the win			0
" we want to play like world champions , so from that perspective four goals is n't enough			1
" @entity11 still tops @entity13 after a fine 4 - 0 win in @entity62 , while @entity4 , @entity63 and @entity64 are all tied on seven points , three points adrift			1
@entity64 boosted its qualifying chances with a 1 - 0 win over the @entity12 in @entity69 , @entity71 's fine strike in the second half proving decisive at @entity73			1
@entity4 might have missed its chance to boost its goal difference and confidence , but at least avoided the humiliation suffered by 2004 @entity80 champion @entity78			2
playing at home in @entity82 , @entity78 's dreadful start to @entity85 qualifying continued with a 1 - 0 home defeat to the tiny @entity87			1
under new coach @entity89 , the team which reached the last 16 of the @entity9 , went down to a strike from @entity91 just after the hour mark			0
it leaves @entity78 with just one point from four games , trailing group leader @entity96 by nine points			2
@entity96 strengthened its position at the top with a 2 - 0 home win over @entity63 with defender @entity102 grabbing both its late goals .			1

@entity4 beats @entity7 4 - 0
@entity35 scores twice for world champions
@entity78 *crashes* to humiliating defeat by @entity87
@entity96 tops @entity85 after *beating* @entity63
