-- the @entity1 is planting its flag in @entity3 , striking a partnership with @entity6 's @entity5 to bring its mix of news , blogging and social commenting to readers in @entity3 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
the start of a @entity3 edition , timed for the country 's elections in september , would become the seventh international launch for the splashy online news and commentary site owned by @entity21 as it sets to build a global new media empire			1
since expanding its footprint to @entity24 and the @entity25 in 2011 , the @entity1 has joined with prominent media companies to launch @entity28 editions in @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
editions and partnerships are in the works for @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			2
" the international expansion has been a dream of mine from the beginning , " @entity43 , president and editor - in - chief of the @entity45 , told the @entity0			2
" we are taking the @entity1 editorial and technology dna everywhere			2
we also are creating a group of international bureaus that can work together on stories			0
" the @entity1 's global expansion stands in contrasts with traditional news organisations that are bleeding revenues and cutting staff			1
the @entity1 has not turned a profit since it was acquired by @entity21 for $ 315m in 2011 , but executives said traffic and ad revenues were growing			1
the site would make money , they said , if it were n't building new ventures such as the international editions and digital video			1
@entity21 reports earnings on friday			2
" one of our strategies has been to invest inside the disruption , " said @entity72 , @entity21 's chief executive			1
" that strategy , although it looked overly bold , allows us to get into some interesting areas			0
" each international outpost -- outside @entity24 and the @entity25 -- is set up as a joint venture , where the @entity1 contributes its technology system and the traditional media outlet contributes its promotional power and understanding of the market as well as its ad sales team			1
together , the groups hire an editorial team of about 12 people , usually led by a prominent ms huffington - like figure , such as prominent @entity29 journalist @entity91 for the @entity1 's @entity29 outpost			1
the @entity1 spends no more than $ 2m per market and splits the costs and the profits with its partners , said @entity97 , chief executive of the @entity45			2
executives at @entity5 and @entity99 , which is working with the @entity1 in @entity29 , said that they decided to link up with the @entity1 rather than go it alone so that they could tap into the new media group 's tech knowhow			1
" we are looking for a scalable model for news portals of the future , " said @entity103 , a member of the management board of @entity5			0
the joint venture comes as the @entity1 has agreed to a distribution deal with @entity113 's @entity112 network in the @entity114 to repurpose its live online video content for cable television			2
@entity117 , which launched last august and has been dubbed the @entity118 for the digital age , airs online			0
but under the deal with @entity112 , it will broadcast six hours a day on @entity112 , which is available in 41m @entity114 homes			0
" we 're in an era where social media drives live tv and live tv drives social media , " said mr @entity113 , who owns and operates @entity112 , with partners that include @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
for @entity117 , the deal gives the nascent operation access to new viewers -- and potentially more lucrative advertising partners			0
the convergence of online video and traditional tv is accelerating , said @entity137 , president and co-founder of @entity117			0
" we want people to engage with our programming			0
if we can create that next generation news network			0
that 's a great place to be			0

@entity1 is starting a @entity3 edition in september
it 's the seventh international launch for the @entity21 - owned site
partnerships and editions are planned for eight *additional* countries
