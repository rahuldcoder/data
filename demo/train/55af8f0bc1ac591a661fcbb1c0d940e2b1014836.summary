fans of anime master @entity1 may remember the mystical , moss - covered forest that serves as the setting for much of " @entity4 " , his epic about humans and the environment			2
that otherworldly backdrop was inspired by the very real forests of @entity10 , an @entity11 - like island in southern @entity12			1
it 's an eco-paradise of stunning landscapes , crystal clear waters , and diverse wildlife			1
the 195 - square - mile island rises swiftly from sea level to a mountainous interior of mile - high peaks that can be snow covered in winter , despite the subtropical climate			1
the granite bedrock is covered by cedar forests , some primary , others the result of reforestation after @entity30 - period logging			1
in summer its beaches serve as the largest nesting grounds in the region for loggerhead turtles			2
the surrounding waters are filled with flying fish , which figure prominently in local menus			2
small white - tailed deer roam the island ( and another curious creature , @entity42 , has said she enjoys hiking in @entity10 )			1
@entity43 macaques sprawl along the roads and fly through treetops			2
together , the deer and monkeys outnumber the 13,000 permanent human residents			0
this unique ecology earned @entity10 a @entity53 @entity52 designation in 1993			1
since then , tourism has flourished			0
in 2012 , about 215,000 people visited , according to @entity56 , who , with @entity57 , runs @entity10 , the official @entity59 tourist website for the island			1
read more : the world 's best unknown hike but the vast majority of visitors come to see one thing : an ancient cedar called @entity67 , estimated to be up to 7,200 years old			1
during the summer holiday and @entity70 ( a series of public holidays in @entity12 at the beginning of may ) , up to a thousand people make the nine - hour round trip on a given day , crowding the viewing platform that was erected to protect the tree and its environment			1
the upside ? most other sights and trails remain blissfully uncrowded			0
most people live in the towns along the coastal road that circles the island , skirting past rocky shores and citrus groves			1
@entity88 is the largest settlement , and the main port , followed by @entity91 , whose river is a favorite kayaking spot			1
there 's @entity95 in the south , @entity97 and its rocky tide pools in the southwest , @entity100 and the sandy @entity101 ( beautiful but dangerous for swimmers ) and @entity104 , which also has a beach			1
it 's an early to bed , early to rise kind of place			1
every morning at 7 a.m. , an island - wide sound system wakes everyone up with classical music			1
it 's time to eat your natto , grab a bento lunch , and hit the trails			1
a 40 - minute drive inland and uphill from @entity91 is @entity122 , a cheesy name for a gorgeous set of paths set over 270 hectares that takes walkers through dense woods , past ancient cedar trees including @entity129 ( 3,000 years old ) , @entity130 ( 2,500 years old ) , and @entity131 ( 1,800 years old , said to resemble the enlightened one )			1
@entity132 is a similar park , though with more varied terrain , including the stretch of impossibly green forest that inspired @entity1			0
the furthest trail here leads up to @entity139 , a climb that 's rewarded with sweeping views over the valley below			2

" the @entity149 trail is a great trail in late afternoon after the buses of tourists have left and the monkeys come down the mountain , " says @entity147 , author of @entity10 : a @entity154 , and the blog @entity155			1
" you 'll pretty much have the trail -- and monkeys -- to yourself			0
it 's similar at @entity122 , the later in the day you go , the more personal the experience becomes			2
" a system of no - frills mountain huts dots the island , for more ambitious hikers interested in overnight treks			2
but there are shorter routes , too , and suitable to almost all ability levels			0
@entity147 's book , can direct hikers on a six hour trip on the @entity174 trail , a varied walk through lush forest , over rushing streams , up to @entity178 - no - ego , the most southerly high altitude marsh in @entity12 ( look for frogs )			1
a final series of scrambles leads to @entity184 - dake , a 1,831 meter peak with panoramic views			0
explore further : mapping @entity187 the sound of water is never far away			0
@entity10 is the wettest place in @entity12 , a fact best appreciated at the foot of one if the many waterfalls			1
the @entity194 - no - taki will inspire quiet meditation in onlookers , while the @entity197 impresses with its scale as it cascades along a huge slab of granite			0
after all this physical exertion , a soak on one of the many onsen on the island will hit the spot			2
@entity56 likes the indoor spa at @entity207			0
" it 's full of locals , " he says			2
@entity147 prefers the outdoor spa at @entity211 : " there is a smaller bath further along the path and obscured by the rocks and here you can soak while listening to the waves lapping the shore and watching the stars			0
" at 9 p.m. , the music plays again			0
it 's time for bed			2
where to stay most of the lodgings on @entity10 are @entity226 , small inns or cottages , where meals are usually included			1
@entity231 breakfasts of fish , rice , pickles , miso soup and natto are the norm			0
near @entity95 , at the foot of @entity240 , @entity238 - no - yado has a set of spacious cottage accommodations with private baths , delicious local food ( some from their own garden ) and some large but friendly spiders			0
just outside of @entity249 , the rooms at @entity248 have small decks looking onto the surrounding forest			0
baths and toilets are shared			0
it 's rustic , peaceful , and the food is fantastic			2
for luxury , the @entity257 resort , near @entity258 , is the best ( and only ) choice			0
how to get there by air : @entity263 , part of @entity265 , has direct flights from @entity267 ( @entity268 ) and @entity269			0
all other flights stop at @entity271			0
by sea : a fast jetfoil ferry has eight daily departures from @entity271			0
the journey takes 2 - 3 hours			0

national brands like @entity281 have offices here , but the local companies are cheaper			0

@entity291 can be an issue			0
it rains year round , but autumn is a bit drier			0
the island is busiest during @entity70 ( end of april , beginning of may ) and the august summer holiday			2

@entity10 : a @entity154 contains detailed descriptions about trails , and other useful information			1
it 's available through @entity305			2
