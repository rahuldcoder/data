-- " you can take my @entity4 , you can take my ring and my watch , but do n't take my @entity7 , " begs @entity1 while being mugged at gunpoint			1
the heartless thief takes her precious strappy sandals anyway			2
ok , so while it 's a pretty far - fetched story line -- how many criminals are going to spot a designer heel two meters away ? -- it does point to the " @entity17 " character 's unhealthy obsession with the shoe label			1
indeed , @entity7 were as much a part of the hit @entity21 's lexicon as @entity23 and @entity24			1
the six - year series introduced the @entity27 brand to millions of women across the world -- even if they could never actually afford them			2
of course , @entity1 's shoe infatuation was n't just the stuff of fiction			1
actor @entity34 -- who won four @entity35 for her portrayal of the sassy @entity38 columnist from 1998 to 2004 -- is a @entity7 diehard for real			1
so when she called up the coveted shoe company 's chief executive , @entity39 , on the off - chance he 'd want to create a range together , she was delighted when the business mogul " took on this little pipsqueak			1
" " i was terrified at picking up the phone and being bold enough to say to @entity39 : ' would you ever consider a partnership ? ' " says 49 - year - old @entity44 , while sitting next to @entity39 in an interview with @entity0 's @entity46			1
" i was perfectly willing for him to say no , prepared for it in fact			2
" " but i did not say no , " adds @entity39 , who had never worked with a female designer before			2
" i said ' come to my office tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock			0
' " accessible accessories ? the shoes will cost between $ 195 and $ 500 and be sold at @entity58 retail giant @entity57 -- a place partly chosen for its accessibility to a wider range of women			1
" i have always felt that there was this group of 10 million women that i was honor - bound to in some way , " said @entity44			0
" i would n't be having this opportunity if it were n't for the dedication and diligence with which they committed to the tv show and my character who loved shoes			0
' " " sure , it would be a thrill to make shoes that cost hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars			1
but the truth is those would not be accessible to those women who have given me this opportunity			0
" creature comforts apart from the ' @entity34 ' stamp of approval , how much influence did @entity44 actually have in the design ? " @entity34 told me she was going to try on everything , " said @entity39			1
" and she does try on everything -- she runs up and down the corridors to make sure that it 'll be comfortable for the woman who 's going to purchase that shoe			1
" @entity44 added : " i would say to @entity39 : ' how comfortable is that going to be under the ball of my foot ? ' because we have spent so many years of our lives , rightly or wrongly , running around in shoes , we know how it feels			0
" other personal touches included different colored ribbons on each shoe -- relating to the ribbons @entity44 would wear in her hair as a little girl			2
" this was something for my mother , " she said of the striking strips of material			0
fashion house born in @entity112 , @entity44 was one of eight children -- including four from her mother 's second marriage			1
" we could n't afford beautiful things , but my mother was very clever and industrious , " she said			0
" we would go to church @entity120 in the wealthier neighborhoods			0
" " i do remember sitting in what we called my mother 's dressing room -- it was just a closet that separated me and my sister 's bedroom that we shared , and my parents ' room -- and we would watch her get dressed , and the last thing she would do was spray fragrance and it seemed like she was walking down this long boulevard to go down to the glamorous nightlife of @entity112			1
" the family later moved to @entity140 , where @entity44 attended acting schools , landing the lead in the @entity144 musical of " @entity145			0
" she made a name for herself on the big screen in " @entity148 , " " @entity150 , " " the @entity151 , " among many others			0
mum 's the word @entity44 married fellow actor @entity154 in 1997 and the couple have three children			2
how does she juggle a successful career and family ? " i am in a position to choose to be busy , " she said			0
" there are millions of women in this country who have to work two or three jobs , who do n't have the support system , who do n't have the financial means to choose the kind of care they want for their children			0
" " when i ride on the subway , every day i can see in someone 's eyes that they 're off to their second or third job in the day , and that they have n't seen their kids , and they 're leaving their children someplace that they 'd rather not			2
and so it seems ridiculous for me to wax on about how busy i am or how hard it is to balance these things in my life			0
