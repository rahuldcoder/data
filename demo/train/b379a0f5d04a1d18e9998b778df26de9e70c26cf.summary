@entity0 -- the chairman of the @entity3 is accusing the @entity4 of " what appears to be an attempt to mislead @entity7 and the public " by manipulating the number of veterans who died as a result of delays in care			1
in a letter to the @entity4 secretary , chairman @entity15 says the @entity4 gave questionable information on a fact sheet distributed during a briefing to his committee in april and has consistently repeated that information in congressional testimony and to journalists			1
the @entity4 's " fact sheet " from april 7 confirms 76 patients were harmed as a result of delays in gastrointestinal care and " of these 76 patients , 23 have passed away , " citing a " national review ... of all consults since 1999			1
" but more recent documents from the @entity4 sent to @entity15 , a @entity35 @entity34 , show those deaths actually came from a much shorter period , from 2010 to 2012 , which may indicate there could be more deaths because of delays than the @entity4 has reported			2
even former va secretary @entity41 repeated the questionable information during a news briefing on @entity43			1
" we went back in time 15 years			0
out of that , we probably looked at 250 million consults			0
that was narrowed down to 76 institutional disclosures , of which there were 23 deaths that had occurred , " @entity41 said in may , about two weeks before he resigned because of systemic delays in care and findings that @entity4 schedulers manipulated patient wait times			1
in a statement to @entity1 , @entity15 said , " the @entity4 scandal was created by selfish bureaucrats who lied in order to hide problems			1
now it appears those involved in the creation of this fact sheet , including a number of folks who work in the department 's central office headquarters , engaged in a similar sort of reprehensible behavior			1
" this is further proof that @entity4 's statistics -- and certain department employees -- simply can not be trusted			2
if va secretary @entity75 ca n't offer a logical explanation for what happened , he needs to act quickly to hold those responsible for this misdirection accountable			2
" @entity80 confirms @entity75 as @entity4 secretary @entity1 reached out late tuesday afternoon to the @entity4 for comment but has n't received a response			1
@entity1 has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across @entity4 hospitals across the country for nearly a year			2
since august 2013 , @entity1 has repeatedly requested records from the @entity4 through the @entity91 , but the agency so far has not provided many key documents			1
@entity15 's letter to @entity75 on monday asks for more information on what he describes as " an incredibly serious matter			1
" @entity15 requested the @entity4 provide the @entity3 with details on the total number of deaths and serious ailments caused by health care delays by next week			1
to ensure accuracy , @entity15 asked the @entity4 to clarify whether the numbers provided are " self - reported " because of evidence of widespread data manipulation at many va facilities			2
@entity15 also asked that the @entity4 share the names of the employees responsible for creating and reviewing the fact sheet that stated the 23 deaths dated back to 1999			1
" our committee has learned that none of the deaths identified by the review of high interest consults occurred prior to 2010 , " @entity15 said			0
" by name , what specific person is was responsible ... ? " @entity15 learned that the 23 deaths occurred from 2010 and 2012 in a letter he received in july from the @entity4 's then interim under secretary for health , dr. @entity125			2
that letter also reported 24 deaths , instead of the previous 23 , perhaps indicating another veteran has died since april			0
@entity130 's letter also stated 20 veterans in @entity132 , @entity133 , and seven veterans in @entity135 , @entity136 , suffered " death or serious injury " because of delays in colonoscopies and endoscopies			0
a lack of gastrointestinal doctors and an inefficient " tracking " system caused the delays , among other factors , according to her letter			0
in a response to a previous question from @entity15 about how the @entity4 disciplined those responsible for the delays in @entity132 and @entity135 , @entity130 wrote that the chief of staff at the @entity155 received " verbal counseling " and voluntarily stepped down			2
an employee in @entity132 , whose name was redacted , " received a reprimand and continues to be employed at the medical center , " and two other employees there voluntary retired , according to the letter			0
the letter does not say any employees in @entity132 or @entity135 have been fired because of the delays in patient care			0
the @entity4 's letter also said delays in gastrointestinal appointments in @entity132 and @entity135 have been resolved , but data recently released from the @entity4 shows that about 11,000 patients in @entity132 are waiting more than 30 days for various appointments and about 3,000 in @entity135 are waiting this long			0
a recent report compiled by the office of sen. @entity176 , @entity177 , found that more than 1,000 veterans might have died in the past decade as a result of malpractice or lack of care from @entity4 medical centers			0
in his confirmation hearing in july , @entity75 vowed to transform the embattled federal health care system			0
" the seriousness of this moment demands urgent action , " @entity75 wrote in his testimony			0
@entity80 passes bill to overhaul @entity4 , sends to @entity191 more va employees said they were told to falsify data veterans waiting longer for cancer care			0
