-- as a young child @entity2 mountaineer @entity1 did n't resemble someone who would one day tackle @entity5			1
at 11 years old he was scrawny and asthmatic			2
he 'd wake up nightly gasping for air and required two inhalers to keep his airways open			0
the doctor told him that his condition would eventually disappear in his 20s or sooner if he started seriously exercising			0
this diagnosis would end up changing and eventually defining his life			0
just after two months of rigorous exercise he was off his inhalers and one year later he was winning running competitions			0
" for me as a young kid , that was a transformation moment because then i realized if i actually work hard and train hard at something , i can actually change the cards that i 'm dealt and i can actually control my own fate and that for me was very inspiring , " says @entity1			1
seventeen years after the doctor 's diagnosis , @entity1 took this determination to tackle the world 's tallest peak			1
the former asthmatic navigated deadly glaciers and subzero temperatures to ascend 8,850 meters ( 29,035 feet ) to the thinnest air on @entity31 and into the history books			0
he became the first @entity2 and youngest @entity33 to ever climb @entity5			1

" i started this climb on the 20th of january 2011 and everybody knows what happened on the 25th			0
now i was maybe 5,000 - 6,000 meters above sea level , somewhere completely remote without any access to the outside world			0
on the 28th , i had this intuitive feeling that i should call home			0
" @entity1 could n't reach his family			1
frantically he called every number he could remember but every call ended in an error message			0
it was n't until he went online he found out @entity2 was swept up in a revolution against president @entity71			1
he was presented with a hard choice , return home or push for the summit			2
he decided climb on undeterred and sent an emotional message to the people rallying in @entity78 when he reached the top			0

' i was inspired and taken by the whole emotion of what was going on			0

@entity1 hopes the mountains he 's conquered , both literal and metaphorical , will resonate with others so that they become better by pushing their own limits			2
" i hope that everything that i 've done and everything i do in the future will inspire people to push beyond their own boundaries ; to understand that the challenges that we face or the limitations that we think about only lie in our mind and that we basically can accomplish anything that we set out to do			0
