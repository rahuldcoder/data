@entity0 -- in a recent piece by prominent @entity5 cartoonist @entity4 , we see one of his favorite characters -- a cantankerous grandfather who along with his two grandchildren is a solid supporter of the @entity10 against the regime in @entity5 -- having managed to tie up @entity12 inside a closet and trying to disguise himself as the world renowned talk show host in order to get to interview @entity17			1
sporting his thick moustache and holding a list of tough questions in hand , the grandfather is charging out of the closet yelling at a @entity1 producer , " get out of my way ! the language of this mr. president only i understand , " while the producer is baffled by the thick moustache that " @entity12 " has suddenly grown			0
the point of the cartoon is a deep and pervasive sense of frustration that @entity5 all over the world have with the inability of prominent @entity35 journalists and talk show hosts to handle the slippery @entity17			1
@entity37 , @entity38 , and @entity12 in particular are being criticized for providing @entity17 with a global forum to say whatever nonsense he wishes without enough of a serious challenge to his statements -- some of which are flat - out lies			2
since the massively contested presidential election of june 2009 , scores of peaceful demonstrators have been arbitrarily arrested , tortured , and murdered ; prominent human and women 's rights activists , reformists , and labor union leaders have been arrested and subjected to @entity55 show trials and given long and punishing prison terms ; the leaders of the opposition @entity10 have been systematically harassed and intimidated ; the universities have gone through yet another round of ideological purges ; yet another cultural revolution to silence and suppress non-conformist ideas is well under way ; an entire cadre of independent - minded journalists have been forced into the indignity of exile -- and yet few of these atrocities manages to gain much attention in the conversations that these prominent @entity35 journalists have with @entity17			1
that sense of frustration is not limited to @entity5			2
@entity73 , the distinguished senior @entity75 correspondent has written a wonderful essay discussing the difficulties of interviewing @entity17			0
mr. @entity73 points out how @entity17 succeeds " in moving the agenda onto a ground of his own choosing , and few , if any , of the @entity83 journalists who have interviewed him have scored many points off him			0
" the former @entity88 correspondent @entity87 has also written an article , " how not to get played by @entity17 , " in which she too testifies that the " @entity5 president has perfected the art of slipping and sliding around even the most seasoned interviewers			1
" perhaps the best example of how @entity17 manages to slip away from hard questions is when @entity37 asked him about the case of @entity96 , a woman charged with murder and adultery and originally condemned to death by stoning			1
in response to @entity37 's question , @entity17 point blank said that this report is false and @entity96 has not been condemned to death by stoning -- which was a plain lie			2
in anticipation of @entity17 's trip to @entity0 , the @entity109 had in fact prepared a full preparatory list of atrocities perpetrated under the administration of @entity17 's for @entity35 journalists -- with key facts and crucial issues that they might raise when interviewing him			1
to be sure , @entity37 did ask @entity17 about executions increasing fourfold since he took office , as well as about the @entity5 regime taking action against opposition leaders , including raiding their offices			1
and in @entity12 's case , after interviewing @entity17 he had a follow - up conversation with @entity125 , the host of @entity1 's " @entity126 , " in which the evasive answers of @entity17 were put in proper context with more detailed attention to the internal atrocities in @entity5			1
but still the balance of the result tipped heavily in favor of @entity17 's rhetorical one - upmanship			0
@entity87 has suggested that " reporters need to be armed with in - depth knowledge of @entity5 's economy , politics and society -- and even then , they may have difficulty getting @entity17 to admit the truth			1
" but that is not the modus operandi of a journalistic culture that is conceptually geared towards geopolitics and " international " politics rather than domestic matters			0
@entity17 always wins in these encounters because he points to other atrocities by redirecting the question at the questioner , and there are plenty of atrocities around the globe			2
the other factor is the language barrier between @entity17 and his interviewers , which he strategically uses to his advantage			2
" mr. @entity17 's technique , " @entity73 points out " is aided by the fact that most of the foreign interviews are carried out in translation -- leaving the journalist less scope for jumping in , and less time to cross-examine			0
" @entity73 's young colleague , @entity168 of @entity75 @entity169 has now become a @entity171 phenomenon because he accosted @entity17 in a hallway at the @entity173 and shouted a succession of questions at him : " mr. @entity17 why do n't you talk to @entity5 journalists ? why do you just talk to foreign journalists ? why do you run away from @entity5 journalists ? " @entity17 left his real surprise for after all his interviews , when during his official address to the @entity181 he effectively accused the @entity35 government of direct involvement in the atrocities of 9/11			1
but in this case , president @entity186 had an opportunity during his subsequent interview with @entity168 to respond to @entity17			0
" for him to make the statement here in @entity205 , " president @entity186 said , " just a little north of @entity190 , where families lost their loved ones , people of all faiths , all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation , for him to make a statement like that was inexcusable , " @entity186 said			0
still , too many of @entity17 's statements went unchallenged last week -- particularly those that had to do with the vast array of atrocities in his own country			2
these are not problems that can be solved by handing to journalists a list of questions to ask a head of state with just too many skeletons in his closet to count			0
these are problems that @entity35 journalism as an institution faces as it tries to cope with and cover a far more globalized planet than we 've ever seen before			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			0

@entity17 presides over regime that commits atrocities , says @entity227
he says @entity35 *television* interviewers are n't *sufficiently* challenging in their questions
@entity227 says @entity17 lied in *denying* @entity5 woman was sentenced to stoning
