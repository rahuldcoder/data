-- the @entity1 concluded wednesday that there is little evidence that efforts to change a person 's sexual orientation from gay or lesbian to heterosexual are effective			1
the report looks at 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007			0
in addition , the 138 - page report -- covering 87 peer - reviewed studies -- said that such efforts may cause harm			0
" contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners , there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation , " said @entity17 , chairwoman of the task force that presented the report at the group 's annual meeting in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the @entity32 - based association represents more than 150,000 members			0
" at most , certain studies suggested that some individuals learned how to ignore or not act on their homosexual attractions			0
yet , these studies did not indicate for whom this was possible , how long it lasted or its long - term mental health effects			1
also , this result was much less likely to be true for people who started out only attracted to people of the same sex			0
" in response , the group 's governing @entity47 passed a resolution wednesday urging mental health professionals not to recommend to their clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or any other methods			1
the group 's @entity55 on @entity57 to @entity58 reached its conclusion after its review of 87 studies conducted between 1960 and 2007 and finding " serious methodological problems " in the vast majority of them			2
those few studies that did have " high - quality " evidence " show that enduring change to an individual 's sexual orientation is uncommon , " it said			1
in addition , the report cited evidence that efforts to switch a person 's sexual orientation through aversive treatments might cause harm , including loss of sexual feeling , suicidality , depression and anxiety			2
many who tried to change and failed " described their experiences as a significant cause of emotional and spiritual distress and negative self - image , " it said			2
the six - member task force was appointed two years ago to address concerns about " efforts to promote the notion that sexual orientation can be changed through psychotherapy or approaches that mischaracterize homosexuality as a mental disorder			1
" the @entity98 removed homosexuality from its @entity99 in 1975			2
the task force noted that some people attempt to change their sexual orientation because it conflicts with their religious beliefs , and recommended that their mental health care providers help them " explore possible life paths that address the reality of their sexual orientation , reduce the stigma associated with homosexuality , respect the client 's religious beliefs , and consider possibilities for a religiously and spiritually meaningful and rewarding life			1
" " in other words , " said @entity17 , " we recommend that psychologists be completely honest about the likelihood of sexual orientation change , and that they help clients explore their assumptions and goals with respect to both religion and sexuality			1
" @entity123 , president of @entity124 , a network of more than 250 ministries that he said " reach out to men and women and families that are affected by what we call ' unwanted same - sex attraction ' " disagrees			0
he offered himself as proof that such efforts can work			0
" the fact is that there are tens of thousands of men and women just like me who once identified as gay , " @entity135 said in a telephone interview			0
" for me and for these people , the truth is change is possible			2
" @entity135 said his transformation from gay man began more than 18 years ago , when he attended a support group at the organization he now leads			0
@entity135 , who said he married a woman nearly 12 years ago , has written a book , " leaving @entity153 , " which was published last month			0
" you ca n't refute a personal story , " he said , adding that about a third of those who try to switch their sexual orientation through the group 's ministries wind up doing so			1
" we 're not talking a light switch that you turn on and off , we 're talking about very deep and complex issues that , i think , take years to resolve			0
" though all mainstream health and mental health organizations concluded years ago that homosexuality is not a mental disorder , the @entity1 formed the task force to work on the report two years ago after noting a resurgence of groups that identified homosexuality as a defect or spiritual or moral failing .			1
