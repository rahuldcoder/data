@entity0 -- the administration of president @entity3 proposed friday a change to immigration rules meant to cut the time undocumented spouses and children of @entity9 citizens are separated from their families while they seek legal status			1
most immigrants living in the @entity9 illegally who marry @entity9 citizens or are children of @entity9 citizens are eligible for green cards , which allow them to live and work in the country permanently			2
under current law , however , they must apply for visas from their home countries while being barred re-entry for three to 10 years , depending how long they lived in the @entity9 without documentation			2
families affected by this @entity23 can petition the government to allow them back into the @entity9 before the time period has elapsed by asking for a waiver and proving that prolonged separation would cause a @entity9 citizen to suffer extreme hardship			1
under the proposed rule change , qualifying illegal immigrants could remain in the @entity9 while they apply for that waiver and as the government decides whether to grant it			1
immigrants who obtain the waiver would still be required to leave the @entity9 to apply for a visa , but would be all but guaranteed the possibility of a quick return			1
the new rule could reduce separations from years to weeks or months and would represent a huge step forward in streamlining the process of obtaining waivers for undocumented immigrants married to @entity9 citizens , @entity41 director @entity40 told reporters			1
last year , @entity41 received some 23,000 waiver applications			0
@entity50 said that number would have been higher were it not for the current policy , which can result in indefinite and prolonged separations			0
" they 're unwilling to risk the extreme hardship to a @entity9 citizen relative by virtue of lengthy separations , " he said			2
" we may well not see waiver applications from people who would otherwise qualify			0
" @entity50 stressed that the standards used to establish eligibility for a hardship waiver will not change			0
but , according to @entity66 , with the @entity67 , which seeks to reduce the number of immigrants , that does n't make the proposal more acceptable			0
" the bar re-entry rule was established as a deterrent to people violating immigration law -- that coming illegally could result in long - term denial back to the @entity9 , " @entity66 told @entity1 after the proposed rule was announced			1
" the administration is undermining this important deterrent			1
" supporters of the rule applauded the administration 's effort to cut red tape and reunite families			2
" this evens the playing field , " said @entity85 , former president of the @entity86			0
" i think it is going to encourage people who are undocumented to come out			0
" the proposed change is open for public comment .			0

the proposal is meant to cut the time families are separated
it would allow some immigrants to remain in the @entity9 while they apply for a waiver
the rule would undermine an important deterrent , an *opponent* says
