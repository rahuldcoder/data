the quest for peace in @entity2 is now crippled with setbacks , as a @entity5 observer mission has suspended operations and attempts to rescue civilians trapped amid violence have proved futile			1
at least 71 people were killed monday , the opposition @entity10 said			1
the dead included " entire families trapped under rubble " when regime forces shelled the city of @entity18 , according to the opposition @entity13			1
" nobody can rescue the victims because of the continuous shelling , " the @entity13 said			2
government forces also shelled the southern town of @entity24 after more than 80 tanks entered the town , killing three people , the @entity13 said			1
it accused " security forces and thugs " of using children in @entity24 as human shields on their tanks to prevent possible attacks by the opposition @entity32			1
also monday , the @entity35 , a @entity37 marine insurer , said that it had stopped coverage for @entity41 operator @entity40 's cargo ship , @entity42 , amid allegations that it is carrying weapons to the @entity2 government			1
@entity48 officials have said the ship is carrying attack helicopters and munitions from the port of @entity53			1
increased violence in @entity2 in recent days so exacerbated the already risky situation faced by the approximately 300 unarmed monitors that the @entity5 announced saturday it was suspending the operation			1
the @entity13 issued a statement saying the decision " represents a failure of ... the international community to effectively and responsibly deal with the situation in @entity2			2
" officials from the @entity64 said the suspension indicated it was time for world leaders to take more severe steps			1
" we say that all options are there and must be put on the table , " said @entity69 , the group 's leader			1
" this regime only understands the language of violence and force			1
" in @entity79 , sen. @entity78 called monday for just that			2
" the @entity2 opposition needs to know that the @entity48 stands with them and that we are willing to take risks to support them when they need it the most , " the ranking member of the @entity86 told an audience at the @entity88 , a conservative think tank			2
" inaction denies us the opportunity to have influence with forces in @entity2 who will one day inherit the country , ceding that to foreign states that may not always share our values			0
" @entity78 took aim at what he said is the @entity102 administration 's toothless policy of calling for @entity2 president @entity103 to step aside			0
" to say they are leading from behind is too generous , " he said			0
" that suggests they are leading			0
" the @entity110 senator from @entity111 accused the administration , " in its desperation , " of appearing to place its hopes on persuading the @entity41 government to push @entity103 from power			0
president @entity102 met with @entity41 president @entity118 on monday at the @entity120 meeting in @entity121 , @entity122			2
afterward , the two leaders issued a statement calling for " an immediate cessation of all violence " and expressing support for efforts by @entity5 and @entity129 joint special envoy @entity130 to broker a peace deal			1
that elicited derision from @entity78			0
" it was the kind of statement that you usually hear when there 's no concrete agreement , " he told @entity134			0
" also , it 's a little weird , orwellian , to consider their statement supporting @entity130 's initiative			0
" @entity78 described the @entity130 plan as " a total failure			0
" in his speech , @entity78 said any military aid should not include @entity48 ground forces , but should include other military might from the @entity48 and its allies , such as @entity151 and other @entity153 countries			0
@entity78 rejected characterizations of the current state of affairs inside @entity2 as a civil war			0
" it 's not a civil war because all the military strength is on one side , and not the other , " he said			0
" at least we ought to give them a chance to have a fair fight			0
" the suspension of the monitoring mission is a major blow to @entity130 's peace plan , which had become a symbol of hope for a country torn by relentless attacks during the 15 - month uprising			0
the @entity2 government has blamed the violence on " armed terrorist groups , " the vaguely defined entities it has consistently blamed over the past year			2
@entity2 opposition groups say more than 13,000 people have been killed since @entity103 's government started cracking down on anti-government protesters last year			1
the @entity5 ' latest estimate puts the death toll at more than 10,000			1
@entity134 can not independently verify government and opposition claims of casualties because the @entity2 government has restricted access by international journalists .			2
