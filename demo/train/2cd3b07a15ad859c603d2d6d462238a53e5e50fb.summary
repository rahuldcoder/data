one of the cooler experiences i 've had in recent memory was meeting @entity3 , a spry 104 - year - old who started a secret women 's shelter decades ago out of her home in @entity7 , @entity8			1
she 's a bundle of smiles and optimism -- and her legacy of helpfulness already has been passed down to her granddaughter , @entity14 , who is executive director of the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity8 , which shelters women and fights violence with educational programs			1
you should join them in helping to make @entity8 a safer place			1
i recently traveled to the 49th state to try to figure out why it has the highest rate of reported rape in the nation -- and what could be done to change that			1

and then do something about it			0
@entity8 does n't have to be the state where rape is most common			1
the lawless ' end of the land ' here are five simple ways you can help make a difference : 1			0
donate to worthy organizations i came across a number of responsible , effective organizations in @entity8 that are working to shelter rape victims and get people talking about what gov. @entity54 called @entity8 's " epidemic " of rape and domestic violence			1
here are four that take online donations and were vetted by @entity61 , from @entity35 's @entity62 : @entity63 on @entity64 and @entity65 aiding women in @entity67 , or aware standing together against rape , or @entity69 @entity70 , or @entity70 2			1
start a petition to get cops in every village there are 75 villages in @entity8 with no local law enforcement presence			1
i visited one such village , called @entity79 , which means " end of the land " in @entity82 , and learned it can take state troopers hours or even four or five days to respond to emergency calls there			0
rape and domestic violence can become normal in such a place			1
there 's a simple solution : send @entity91 , who are unarmed but trained , to the lawless villages			2
sexual assault cases are 3Â½ times as likely to be prosecuted in villages with a @entity91 , according to the @entity96			2
if you want to see vpsos in every village in @entity8 , including @entity79 , i 'd encourage you to start a petition at @entity101 or @entity102			2
if you do , please send me the link on @entity104 ( @ jdsutter ) , and i 'll add the link here so other readers can sign it			2
states where rape is most common 3			2
tell your story as part of " we are the 59 % " fifty - nine percent of women in @entity8 will be raped , assaulted , beaten or threatened with violence in their lifetimes , according to a statewide survey			1
stand in solidarity with this majority of @entity8 women by sharing your story of survival			1
breaking the silence will help end the epidemic by reminding victims that they are not to blame -- and empowering them to have their voices heard			0
i met several victims of rape and domestic violence in @entity8 who told me their personal healing started when they realized they were n't alone			1
visit this @entity31 page to share your story and read other submissions			0
host a " @entity136 " rally ( from your phone ) @entity54 , the governor , is trying to get the state talking about domestic violence and sexual assault by encouraging people all over @entity8 to hold " choose respect " rallies in their communities on march 27			1
the idea is for men to choose respect for women rather than using violence against them			2
i think the statement can also be read as a demand from any person that the rest of society chooses respect for them and everyone else			0
hold your own mini- " @entity136 " rally taking a photo of yourself and uploading it to @entity104 , @entity159 or @entity160 with the hashtag # chooserespect			0
bonus points : write " @entity163 " on your hand			0
your photos will show up on this page			0
if you 're in @entity8 , visit this website for info on how to hold a rally			2
@entity8 faces its ' resident evil ' 5			2
demand rape kits are counted and tested more cases of reported rape need to be prosecuted -- and offenders need to be convicted			1
otherwise , men assume they can rape with impunity			0
according to @entity70 's founder and president , @entity179 , 40 % of rapes are reported and just 3 % result in the offender spending so much as a day behind bars			2
one way to improve justice for rape survivors is to ensure that forensic evidence collected from crime scenes is tested			0
there are massive backlogs of so - called " rape kits " across the country			2
hundreds of thousands of kits are untested , activists say , in part because doing so is expensive , and sometimes because these cases are n't given priority			0
testing the kits , meanwhile , can result in offenders being charged and convicted			0
@entity200 , a senior policy adviser and @entity8 's " @entity163 " coordinator , said @entity8 's backlog of forensic evidence " has been drastically reduced " in recent years			1
" i do not think we are in dire straits , unlike some other states , " she said			0
@entity208 , the forensic laboratory manager at the @entity209 , said his statewide lab currently has 141 " unassigned requests " for sexual assault kit analysis			0
it 's possible , he said , law enforcement agencies have additional backlogs they never sent to his lab in @entity217 for analysis			0
the governor 's fiscal year 2015 budget would include $ 115,000 to speed up the processing of the evidence , @entity200 and @entity208 said			0
@entity8 , according to endthebacklog.org and @entity223 , is part of the majority of states not providing data on the number of untested rape kits and not having legislation to ensure the forensic evidence is tested			1
you can demand that rape kits in @entity8 or in your home state are tested by sending a letter to your elected representatives			1
@entity237 makes it easy to petition your elected officials			0
share this post with your friends the more people who know @entity8 has an " epidemic " of rape and domestic violence , the more chance that will change			1
