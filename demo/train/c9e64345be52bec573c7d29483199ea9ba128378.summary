three days before @entity1 , @entity0 died in a fusillade of police gunfire outside a strip mall			1
he had been arguing with officers in a parking lot next to a shuttered @entity9 restaurant when he was shot , in full view of passing motorists and while he was holding some sort of knife			2
@entity15 prosecutor @entity14 said later that the squad of police confronting him opened fire " because apparently , at this point in time , he was threatening to assault police			1
" @entity14 ' office and the @entity23 are investigating @entity25 's death			1
@entity15 police chief @entity26 said @entity25 was " known to be an assaultive person " with " a long history " of contacts with law enforcement , " not only with police from our department but with the county			1
" @entity25 's cousin , @entity35 , acknowledged @entity25 had been jailed for minor offenses like vagrancy in the past , but , " he was not violent			1
" and @entity25 's mother is growing impatient with the probe and questions why police opened fire so furiously on her son , whom she said was mentally ill. the chart blog : mental health " it appeared to be a firing squad dressed in police uniforms , " @entity25 told @entity45 from her hometown of @entity47 , @entity48			1
" there was another way			0
they did not have to kill him			0
he had not done anything			0
he was not a murderer			0
he was not a criminal			0
" @entity25 said her son had once trained as a civil right activist , been an avid reader and played football			1
he had lived in @entity15 for 35 years and received @entity63 disability payments for a mental illness , but , " he knew his rights			1
" " everybody knew him			0
the police knew him well , " she said			2
" so that 's another question : they knew him , so why ? why did they kill him ? " @entity71 : community questions police shooting the july 1 shooting happened in a parking lot on @entity77 , a busy commercial strip on the north side of @entity15			1
in a video purchased by @entity45 , shot by a motorist from across the street , the 49 - year - old @entity25 is seen arguing with a half - dozen officers			1
for more than three minutes , he walks back and forth , and at one time appears to crouch in a " karate stance , " according to the man who captured the scene			0
police said @entity25 had just had a run - in with a convenience store clerk			1
on the video , he tells police , " my name is @entity0 , i just called 911			1
my name is @entity0 , and i 'm p --- ed off			2
" when an officer tells him to put the knife down , he responds , " i ai n't putting s -- t down			0
" he appears unimpressed by a police dog , telling officers , " let him go			2
let the motherf --- ing dog go			0
" finally , he turns to the left of the frame , where another officer had moved out of view a short time earlier			0
it 's then that the police open fire with a reported 46 shots in a five - second hail of bullets			2
" i 'm stunned that six human beings would stand in front of one human being and fire 46 shots , " @entity25 said			2
" i just do n't understand that			0
it 's a lot of pain in that because it only takes one shot , so the question is why ? " she questioned why none of the cameras in the police cars at the scene recorded the shooting -- " none of them work			2
" " so that 's the question i have and the community has is , what 's taking so long ? " she said			1
" why is not being transparent ? " @entity133 , a former @entity134 police officer , told @entity45 's " @entity141 " that the video is " a perceptive nightmare " for a police department and could reflect a lack of training by the officers			2
" this was n't a scenario where he was discharging a weapon in their direction , " he said			0
but @entity133 added that the shooting may yet be determined to be justifiable			0
" one of the things the public has to understand , an individual wielding a knife at you at about 20 feet can be on top of you in a split second , " he said			0
" the public does n't know this because they do n't do this for a living			0
" neither state police nor the prosecutor 's office would comment on the investigation			1
in a written statement to @entity45 , the state police said , " our focus is on conducting a complete and thorough investigation , rather than a hasty one			1
" but @entity172 councilman @entity171 , who also has criticized the pace of the investigation , said the probe should be a " top priority			2
" when @entity45 showed @entity171 the video , which he had n't seen before , he said , " this is disturbing			0
" " i can see what people are traumatized at , looking at something like that , " @entity171 said			0
" @entity25 said her family is conducting its own investigation into the shooting , " and at the end of that investigation we will decide what next steps to take with our legal advisors			1

@entity0 was killed in a confrontation with police in @entity15 , @entity197
" it appeared to be a firing squad dressed in police uniforms , " his mother says
