it 's time for someone in the @entity2 to show some backbone			1
@entity4 , the owner of the @entity5 , has got to go and he has got to go in a very public fashion			1
listen to the audio recording that is alleged to be of his voice spewing vile reproach at his mistress about her associating with black people in public , and taking photos with black people ( @entity15 and @entity16 , in particular )			2
the audio has not been authenticated as @entity4 , but he has not denied it			1
listen to the entire five minutes of unhinged ranting and you 'll hear a man forbid a woman ( @entity4 's girlfriend , @entity22 , @entity23 alleges ) from bringing black people to @entity2 games , as well as some very strange , offensive opinions about " black @entity26 " being treated worse in @entity27 than " white @entity26			1
" by the way , racial discrimination issues have trailed @entity30 for years , with the @entity2 getting red flag after red flag on this guy and doing nothing about it			1
there are many questions about the legality of the recording and how @entity23 got its hands on it ( my money is on @entity22 , who is embroiled in legal troubles with @entity4 's wife , is almost 60 years his junior , and also happens to be of mixed race and part black )			1
if the recording is proven to be @entity4 , the @entity2 has a wide open court and one shot to shatter the glass on this dunk			1
forget the short suspension paired with " pressure " to sell the team -- a la @entity57 , who in 1999 was forced out as owner of baseball 's @entity60 after making comments about blacks , @entity26 and gays			1
the @entity66 's demand that @entity4 be barred from all playoff games this season is n't enough			1
what the players in the league deserve is for @entity4 to be suspended for life and publicly -- and unprecedentedly -- stripped of his franchise rights			1
if they merely " suggest " he sell the team , he 'll just complain that he was set up by a crazy mistress and will make out like a bandit			2
he bought the team in 1981 for $ 12 million			0
@entity79 recently put the value of the team at $ 575 million			0
we can admonish @entity4 all we want , and there has been plenty of that coming in : from @entity86 ( " i could n't play for him " ) to @entity88 ( " sickening " ) to the @entity89 ( " incredibly offensive " )			1
but talk is cheap : it 's time for someone to be bold			1
the players have already missed the opportunity to send the @entity2 , its owners and its fans a powerful message			2
just days after the story broke , the players , most of whom are black , had game four in the league series on sunday night in @entity104			0
they showed up and they got shellacked			0
they found ways to make statements of protest : turning their practice jerseys inside out , piling their warm - ups in the center court and wearing black socks in solidarity with other teams			0
it was noteworthy , but once again , @entity4 got a pass			2
the players would have done the league , the country and themselves a huge favor if they had just not shown up to the game			0
with the momentum of this story , and the outrage building , a boycott would have been the principled stance that the league has been missing all these years			0
the nation would have been 100 % behind the players			0
the @entity5 jerseys would have been reclaimed by the players as a symbol of power , rather than a reminder of its racist owner			0
but now there will just be more talk			0
should fans boycott the games ? should people not wear the jerseys ? the public , the @entity5 fans and the players need a way to show their support for the players and their disgust for @entity30			0
for now , we wait to see what commissioner @entity150 and the @entity2 decide to do			2
they might as well play to win			0
as they say in sports , go big or go home .			2

@entity157 : after racist audio , @entity2 should publicly strip @entity4 of franchise rights
she says the audio not yet authenticated , but @entity4 trails racist history *unchecked* by @entity2
she says team showed outrage by *altering* *uniforms* ; they should have boycotted game instead
@entity169 : there will be a lot of talk ; what 's needed is bold action . @entity2 , go big or go home
