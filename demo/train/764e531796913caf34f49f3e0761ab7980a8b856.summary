the family of former @entity2 @entity1 has a message for @entity5 's new president : their @entity7 son is not a spy , has never been one , and he should be released immediately from prison in @entity5			1
" i just ask -- i just want the president to consider us as an @entity5 family , and that my husband is sick , and me as a mother i 've suffered a lot , more than two years , " said @entity12 , @entity1 's mother , speaking in halting @entity13			1
the family made a plea in an exclusive interview to @entity23 on the eve of @entity5 president @entity26 's first visit to the @entity7 , where he will attend the @entity27			1
@entity1 's father , @entity28 , is ailing with brain cancer , and the family is imploring the @entity5 government to release their son before time runs out for the elder @entity1			1
" please just let @entity1 come home , " said @entity12			2
" @entity1 did n't do any crime , he did n't do anything			2
just let him to come home and make his family happy again			0
" this month , @entity1 , 30 , wrote a letter to @entity7 secretary of state @entity40 saying a confession he made to the spying charges leveled by @entity5 were " false " and " based solely on confessions obtained by force , threats , miserable prison conditions , and prolonged periods of solitary confinement			1
" @entity1 's family said he had gone to @entity5 to visit his grandmother when he was arrested in august 2011 , accused by @entity5 's @entity51 of working as a @entity53 agent			1
born in @entity54 , @entity55 , then raised in @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity1 graduated from high school and joined the @entity2 , where he served four years , becoming a rifleman and also serving in @entity60			1
his parents came to the @entity7 in 1979 as the @entity63 revolution spread across @entity5			2
two years ago @entity1 surprised his parents by telling them he wanted to visit @entity5 for the first time , to meet relatives he had never seen -- including his ailing grandmother -- and find his roots			1
" we know there is a risk involved , " @entity12 said			0
" we were always cautioning			0
and me , as a mother , because i know , i grew up in that country , i always cautioned about , you know , if something happened			0
but my kids , they said , ' @entity78 , my friend , they went , they came back , you know			0
and nothing 's gon na happen			0
' and they never believe me , you know ... that it 's very dangerous			0
" in august 2011 , @entity1 called his mother from @entity5 to say he was having the time of his life and he would be coming home soon			1
he told them he would leave two days after a final farewell party his @entity5 relatives were having on august 29			1
that party came and went ; @entity1 never showed up			2
for three months , no one in his family knew anything about @entity1 's whereabouts			1
then one day in december 2011 , @entity5 state television aired @entity1 's purported confession he was a @entity53 spy , and announced that he was imprisoned			1
the suspect was " tasked with carrying out a complex intelligence operation and infiltrating the @entity5 intelligence apparatus , " @entity5 's @entity100 reported at the time			1
the family described being in total shock			0
" that day we saw his face			0
and he was confessing ... he 's a @entity53 spy , and i said , ' wow , ' " his mother said			1
@entity12 has said all along that her son 's confession was fabricated and forced by his @entity5 captors , a position the @entity110 supports			1
" they had three months to make this story , " his mother said			0
" they knew from beginning this is a good catch , you know			0
... he 's a @entity2			1
" she said she believes that 's why the family was not initially allowed to talk to her son			2
" that 's why they did n't want us to talk to him			0
because he 's going to tell us the truth , what happened , " @entity12 said			0
" and they just come up with this story			0
and an attorney told us same thing			0
he said , ' he did n't do anything			0
' " asked why it happened to his son , @entity136 offered some thought			0
" naturally , we have some speculations that someone got jealous of him and did n't like the idea that he lives in @entity7 , and they are living over there in @entity5 , " his father said			2
" ( that person ) probably came up with some lies about him , called him a @entity53 spy , ( because ) that was his original charge			1
" the initial charge and detention has stretched to a two - year ordeal			0
weeks after his on - air confession broadcast on @entity5 television , @entity1 was tried in an @entity5 court and sentenced to death			1
months later , @entity5 's @entity157 overturned his death sentence and ordered a retrial			1
during his imprisonment , @entity1 spent 16 months in solitary confinement and went on a monthlong hunger strike			2
the @entity1 family has tried to bring public attention to @entity1 's plight , hoping to secure his release			1
letter after letter , plea after plea , @entity1 's sister @entity167 has struggled to get political support to intervene			1
now that @entity5 has elected a more moderate president , @entity26 , in place of firebrand @entity176 , the family may have a better chance for his release			1
" we just hope that we are reaching the ears -- especially now with this new transition in government in @entity5 -- the ears of the right people , " @entity178 said			2
the @entity110 has said @entity1 's imprisonment follows a pattern by the @entity5 regime , which it says " has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies , of eliciting forced confessions , and of holding innocent foreigners for political reason			1
" @entity1 is the latest in a series of @entity7 -- most of them @entity5 - @entity7 -- to face arrest in the country in recent years : in 2007 , @entity5 arrested several @entity5 - @entity7 -- including @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 , who were all later released			1
( that same year retired @entity201 agent @entity200 went missing after last being seen on @entity5 's @entity202			1
despite photos from his captors , his whereabouts are still unknown			0
) in may 2008 , retired @entity5 - @entity7 businessman @entity206 was arrested on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group			2
he was released more than two years later			0
in 2009 , three @entity7 hikers , also accused of spying , were arrested and ultimately released			0
@entity197 was re-arrested in july 2009 amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown			0
in march 2010 , he was allowed a temporary release that was later extended , according to the website freekian09.org			0
the @entity5 - @entity7 scholar is not allowed to leave the country , the website says			2
journalist @entity217 was arrested in january 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one - day trial that was closed to the public			0
she was freed in may that year			0
literary translator @entity221 was detained in january 2012 @entity223 pastor @entity222 was reportedly detained in september 2012 last week , @entity5 released at least a dozen other political prisoners , including one prominent human rights lawyer			2
then , on monday , the government released dozens more prisoners			0
" my wishful thinking was praying and hoping that @entity1 's name was among that list of people that were released , " his sister @entity167 said			2
but we 're not going to give up			0
" @entity12 made a tearful plea to @entity5 's new president , in @entity13 and @entity240 , parent to parent , she says , to let her son come home			1
" it 's more than two years , " she said , " just let @entity1 come home			1
... @entity1 did n't do any crime , he did n't do anything			2
just let him to come home and make his family happy again			0
