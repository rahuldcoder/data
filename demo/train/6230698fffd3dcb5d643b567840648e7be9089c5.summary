-- president @entity1 is visiting @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 this week for a series of key regional summits			1
the trip is his first opportunity since his @entity10 's massive defeat in the midterm elections to demonstrate the power of the presidency			1
surveys conducted by the @entity15 show strong support outside @entity2 for the president 's announced " pivot " or " rebalance " to the @entity19			1
the same polls show that experts across @entity19 see great resilience in the @entity24 economy and expect -- and want -- @entity24 to continue leading @entity26 integration and cooperation in the future despite the sudden rise of @entity2 power			1
indeed , it is largely because of the aggressive way @entity2 is using its power that allies and partners want more commitment from @entity37			1
yet like the @entity24 people , @entity26 governments have found @entity1 's leadership wanting			1
this is n't for lack of interest in the region -- the president grew up in @entity46 and @entity47 after all			0
although his claims to be the first " @entity50 " president could be challenged by historians who remember that @entity53 , for example , had once been governor general in the @entity54 , @entity1 appears genuinely interested in @entity19 , and his administration has done a better job than any of its predecessors attending regional summits and organizing high - level bilateral meetings			1
so give the @entity1 administration an " a " for attendance			1
the problem is class participation			0
but while the president and his team have sent mixed and confusing signals about their understanding of the power dynamics in @entity19 and their willingness to do the political lifting at home necessary to make the pivot real , there are two things the president can do during his current trip to try to turn this around			2
first , he has to articulate clearly and consistently his bottom line			0
administration officials claim they have done so repeatedly , but the problem is that every speech and announcement by the administration on @entity19 differs from the one before			0
in 2009 , the president announced in a summit with then - president @entity86 of @entity2 that he would respect @entity2 's " core interests " and then dropped that line after @entity88 interpreted it as acquiescence to @entity2 demands			2
in january 2011 , the president reversed course when the @entity94 cited @entity2 along with @entity95 as a major threat in the @entity98 's new @entity97			2
the @entity2 responded by charging the administration with @entity101 - style containment			0
then , in 2013 , national security adviser @entity102 announced the @entity24 would " operationalize " @entity2 president @entity104 's proposal for a " @entity105 " between @entity37 and @entity88 that relegated @entity24 allies to second - tier status			2
the administration then dropped that formulation , too			0
the president is speaking on @entity24 @entity19 strategy in @entity4 at the end of the trip			0
but he will have to get this right : we stand by our allies , we will work for an open trans - @entity50 economic architecture , and we will work to cooperate with @entity2 to the greatest extent possible but will not compromise on our values or security commitments			0
second , the president has to demonstrate that he has the skills and commitment to complete the critical @entity126 negotiations and lock in a model for regional economic integration that sets high standards for openness before @entity2 starts using its economic weight to write new rules			1
this means not only pressuring @entity134 -- the biggest economy in the talks -- but also showing leadership with @entity138			2
our partners in the region know that the @entity24 has never completed a trade agreement without first winning congressional support through so - called " fast track " authority since the @entity145 gives that branch of government and not the president power to complete commercial treaties			1
@entity1 's team has decided it will squeeze the best deal out of @entity134 and others first and then ask @entity138 for permission			1
this could work in theory , but the problem is that our partners will not put their best deal on the table until they see evidence the president can deliver @entity138			2
republicans generally support trade more than @entity10 , so this could be an area for bipartisan cooperation -- except that the @entity94 refused even to address the issue before the midterms and is now provoking a partisan fight with promises to bypass @entity138 on immigration , @entity95 negotiations and other issues			0
if @entity19 , and @entity134 in particular , see that the president can and will work with @entity138 on trade , then the talks could essentially be wrapped up this trip			0
if not , the " pivot " will look hollow			0
though there are questions in @entity19 about the president 's leadership , especially after the midterm results last week , the public in many parts of the region likes @entity1 and want him to succeed			1
and with the rise of @entity2 , governments from @entity189 to @entity190 need him to succeed			0
this week may be his best chance to prove he can .			0

@entity194 : @entity1 has a chance to show power of the presidency after election
@entity26 governments have found @entity1 's leadership wanting , @entity194 says
@entity1 must show commitment to @entity126 trade deal , he says
