the irony of @entity2 's center - stage moment this week was palpable			1
just as she is leaving her coveted position as chair of the @entity6 , handing the reins to the incoming @entity9 majority â € ” and as questions abound in her home state about whether she will retire -- she seemed to reach the pinnacle of her power , once again showing willingness to buck members of her party and wave off critics			0
facing few political consequences in @entity20 where her @entity6 seat is firmly in her grasp , @entity2 , 81 , was defiant as she took the @entity6 floor tuesday to announce the release of a 525 - page summary of the @entity6 's report on the @entity28 's treatment of detainees â € ” the product of five years of line - by - line scrutiny of some six million internal government documents			1
it was a scorching condemnation of the harsh interrogation techniques of the @entity36 era with the striking conclusion that those " deeply flawed " tactics had failed to produce information that thwarted terrorist attacks or led to the apprehension of terrorist suspects			0
in fact , @entity2 said , torture often led to " false information			1
" even in a post- sept. 11th era , the techniques revealed -- mock executions , waterboarding , detainees stripped and chained to a concrete floor , others deprived of sleep for up to 180 hours -- were chilling			0
arrows flew at @entity2 from many directions			1
she was under pressure from secretary of state @entity57 to delay the release of the report until the @entity60 , but did not buckle			2
the @entity28 scoffed at the report 's " flawed analyses of the techniques " and refuted its central conclusion that their procedures had failed to prevent attacks			2
the @entity68 issued a warning that the report could spark a reaction from violent extremists			2
@entity9 critics like @entity9 sen. @entity74 of @entity75 took to @entity76 deriding the document as " a one - sided partisan @entity6 report that now places @entity80 lives in danger			2
" @entity83 @entity82 sen. @entity82 argued that the report had vilified operatives at the @entity28 who should be hailed as heroes for attempting to protect the @entity80 public			2
unapologetic but the one - time mayor of @entity89 , who has held her @entity6 seat for 22 years , was unapologetic			0
while it was true , she said , that the report was going out in a " period of turmoil and instability " in many corners of the world : " that 's going to continue for the foreseeable future whether this report is released or not			2
" she added that she hoped the release would show the world that " @entity80 is big enough to admit when it 's wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes			0
" @entity2 also seemed to put a point on her own legacy : " history will judge us by our commitment to a just society governed by law and the willingness to face an ugly truth and say : ' never again			1
' " unlike some @entity114 who were voted out of office last month , @entity2 faced her critics this week without any concern of political consequences in her home state			1
" @entity2 can serve in the @entity6 for as long as she wants , " said @entity121 , who heads the @entity124 's @entity123			1
" it 's hard to imagine her facing a credible challenge if she did decide to run for re-election , which puts her in the relatively rare position of not having to worry about public opinion on this			0
a senator facing a precarious re-election campaign might be a little more worried about taking on the country 's national security leadership			0
" younger generation still , there is intense speculation within @entity20 about whether @entity2 and sen. @entity138 , who are up for re-election in 2016 and 2018 , respectively , will step aside after their current terms			1
that would create a game of musical chairs for the younger generation of @entity20 democrats like attorney general @entity147 , lieutenant gov. @entity148 , former @entity150 mayor @entity149 and his successor , @entity151			1
many @entity20 would like to see that fight play out			1
in a recent @entity156 / @entity155 poll , 59 % percent of registered voters said @entity20 would be better off with new candidates as the state 's @entity158			1
but that does not mean that @entity2 is in danger of being tossed from her seat			1
the @entity9 has been decimated in @entity20 -- with no viable challengers on the horizon -- and it is highly unlikely that the party 's younger generation would take her on			1
unlike @entity138 , 73 , who has hinted from time to time about the possibility of retirement , @entity2 has given no indication that she is thinking about leaving the @entity6			1
@entity2 , known across @entity20 and @entity170 as " @entity171 , " has reached her enviable position as an unapologetic but sometimes unpredictable progressive with centrist tendencies			1
her memorable introduction to the statewide stage in @entity20 was when she was ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1990 and delivered a speech to the democratic state party convention embracing the death penalty			2
" yes , i support the death penalty			0
it is an issue that can not be fudged or hedged , " she told the crowd , which drowned her out with a loud chorus of boos			0
seeking alliances when she and @entity138 were elected to the @entity6 in " the year of the woman " in 1992 , they took markedly different paths			0
both championed women 's issues like abortion rights			0
but while @entity138 became known as a shrill partisan , @entity2 earned a reputation as a hard worker who continually sought alliances with colleagues on the other side of the aisle			2
" @entity2 has been known throughout her @entity6 career as conciliator , someone who can bring together warring parties to find common ground on difficult issues , " said @entity201			1
" but there are certain issues on which she does n't compromise and she digs in and fights			0
" those fights have sometimes surprised her supporters and made it difficult to slap her with the label of a @entity20 liberal			2
she has long championed the assault weapon ban , for example , but also supported the @entity218 and defended @entity36 administration surveillance practices that were anathema to liberals			0
she notably called @entity222 's leaks of classified information about @entity80 intelligence " an act of treason			0
" and she infuriated liberals with her backing of the @entity230 's broad - reaching and covert effort to collect data from the telephone calls of @entity80			0
she felt compelled to do so out of a sense of obligation to " keep this country safe , " she told the @entity236 in a 2013 interview , " so put that in your pipe and smoke it			0
" that long history of contradictions has given @entity2 more running room than other @entity114 on issues like torture , said @entity245 , who recently helped manage @entity20 gov. @entity247 's re-election campaign			1
" she 's viewed as thorough , thoughtful , and as close to non-partisan on the issue of national security as is possible in today 's politically polarized environment , " @entity245 said			0
" if it was a different @entity253 , it would be easier for some to be dismissive of the questions she 's raising , but she 's built significant credibility as a trusted voice on national security , so she has to be taken seriously			0
she 's raising two critical issues which will define our debate about torture in the coming months : does it make us safer , and is it something we accept as consistent with our nation 's moral code ? " as @entity114 transition to the minority , some have suggested that @entity2 is at the twilight of her career			1
not so fast , her allies say			0
she 's content to let others play that political parlor game , while she remains mum about her plans			2
@entity275 , @entity2 's longtime campaign consultant who began working with her in 1989 , noted that her policy agenda is still lengthy , topped with complex issues like @entity20 's water woes			1
as for retirement ? " she does n't spend any time thinking about that , " he said .			0

torture report was a powerful moment for @entity2
while some in @entity20 clamor for new leaders , @entity2 mum on plans
over her long career , @entity2 has defied labels
