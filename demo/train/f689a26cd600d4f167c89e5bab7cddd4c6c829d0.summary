-- after crashing in the @entity2 and being overlooked by his team for the @entity4 -- he became the first @entity6 winner of the race in 2012 -- @entity8 hoped relief would come at the @entity10			1
" it 's given me another focus rather than just lolling about at home feeling miserable , " he was quoted as saying by @entity11			1
@entity15 indeed won a medal thursday in the first day of action in @entity18 , but it was n't the one he wanted			0
@entity15 and his @entity22 teammates could only take home silver , behind a rampant @entity25 , in the 4,000 - meter team pursuit final			1
it means that while he has triumphed in @entity29 and won four @entity31 golds , he 's never stood atop the podium at the @entity10			1
but instead of dwelling on the disappointment , @entity15 was already looking ahead to the @entity31 in @entity34 in 2016			0
" it 's two years to @entity34 and you ca n't win all the time , " he told @entity36			1
" we 've had limited preparation			0
" that 's the reality of it			1
we 'll look back on this in two years with hopefully gold medals around our necks and say this was the start point for us			2
that 's what it 's all about			2
" it 's going to be two years of graft now and it 's so different to the road			2
i ca n't underestimate how much work it 's going to take			2
" despite @entity22 's runner - up finish , @entity15 enjoyed his time with his teammates			1
" it 's been brilliant , " he said			2
" i said to the boys , ' it 's like being on holiday			2
' i got to go back to work monday morning now			0
" it 's been just a nice break from everything from the road			2
" the @entity25 quartet of @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 set a new @entity10 record , clocking in at three minutes , 54.851 seconds to better @entity22 by about six seconds			1
@entity75 as expected , there was a @entity78 winner in the pool in the 200 - meter breaststroke			2
what was n't expected was that it was @entity83 , not @entity84			1
@entity75 finished second at @entity85 and said he wanted to set a world record at the @entity10			1
but the @entity18 native was slower than @entity83 in the heats and once again in thursday 's final			1
he narrowly led @entity83 after 100 meters , though @entity83 won comfortably in the end -- by more than a second over his higher profile compatriot			1
@entity83 established a @entity10 record time of 2.07.30			1
earlier thursday , @entity78 's @entity94 defended her title in the 400 - meter individual medley			2
she was both ecstatic -- and tired			0
" that was just incredible , " she was quoted as saying by @entity97			0
" i literally could n't feel my legs for the last 50 so , when i touched the wall , i was hoping and praying that i could go fast			0
" @entity101 rule in triathlon it was billed as brother vs. brother in the men 's triathlon			0
they indeed led the way and not for the first time @entity109 beat younger sibling @entity111 to gold			0
@entity109 , who also won gold on home soil at @entity85 , finished in 1:48.50 , 11 seconds better than @entity111 -- the bronze medalist at the @entity85			0
they were virtually tied entering the final portion of the triathlon , the run , before @entity109 broke away			0
" this is the goal i wanted to achieve for the season and i 've done it now , " @entity109 told @entity36			0
" now i 've done everything i 've wanted to do in my career			0
i do n't know what to do now			0
maybe i should retire , " he joked			0
@entity124 pulls out @entity22 's @entity125 claimed gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters at the @entity31 in @entity127 , making his ' @entity130 ' celebration a worldwide phenomenon			1
but @entity124 wo n't be achieving the double in track 's two longest races at the @entity10 after pulling out due to a lingering stomach illness			1
he 'll continue to train in @entity29 and hopes to return in time for the @entity136 that begin august 12 in @entity137			0
" i have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the @entity10 , " @entity124 told the @entity139 website			1
" the sickness i had two weeks ago was a big setback for me			0
" training is getting better here in @entity145 but i need another few weeks to get back to the level i was at in 2012 & 2013			0
" i really wanted to add the @entity10 titles to my @entity31 and @entity148 but the event is coming a few weeks too soon for me as my body is telling me it 's not ready to race yet			1
