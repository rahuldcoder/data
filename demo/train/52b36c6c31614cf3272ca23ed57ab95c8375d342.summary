-- update : we all know the old saying about things that seem too good be true ... but sometimes we get pulled in by golden ideas anyway			0
such , it seems , is the case with @entity8 's " lost and found " dog , @entity9			1
it appears that the @entity9 video is nothing more than a marketing stunt to promote the airline 's new lost and found service			1
" the dog @entity9 symbolizes the service we are offering to our customers , " a @entity8 spokesman said in an e-mail to @entity0			1
" it shows the effort and dedication of our @entity25 team			0

" when you see the reactions of the passengers , that really is amazing			2
" judging by the collective " awww " that rings out through the arrivals hall as @entity9 uses his remarkable sniffing powers to track down the owner of a forgotten @entity61 , the dog is a hit			2
" he can really do something no one else can " @entity8 says @entity9 is part of a new lost and found team put together in response to the high number of queries about forgotten items the airline receives through social media			1
