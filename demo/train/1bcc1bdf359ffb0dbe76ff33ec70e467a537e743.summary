another sign of new rapprochement with @entity3 culture , or a cynical public relations ploy ? @entity6 's top leaders used @entity7 to send @entity9 greetings that praised @entity10 , continuing a new era of social media outreach by a government previously known for @entity15 extremism and political belligerence			1
" may @entity10 , prophet of love & peace , bless us all on this day			2
wishing merry # @entity9 to those celebrating , esp @entity6 @entity23 , " said a tweet from the official account of @entity6 president @entity21			2
in response to @entity21 , the @entity26 's hardline @entity25 , ayatollah @entity27 , tweeted back : " no doubt that @entity10 # @entity10 has no less value among @entity30 than [ he has ] among the pious @entity23			2
" another tweet from @entity27 's account said that " @entity10 # @entity10 , the son of # @entity34 , was a herald of @entity37 's grace , blessing & guidance for man			1
" the messages come as @entity6 seeks to reshape its relationship with the @entity42 and other @entity3 powers more than three decades after the @entity15 revolution launched an era of diplomatic estrangement			1
its economy crippled by international sanctions over its nuclear program , @entity6 recently agreed to freeze some nuclear development efforts in exchange for the easing of some sanctions while talks continue on a final deal that @entity42 officials say would prevent @entity58 from building a nuclear weapon			1
however , @entity60 and some @entity42 legislators warn that @entity6 was manipulating president @entity63 's administration and its allies in the talks without intending to truly give up its quest for a nuclear weapon			1
@entity21 insists @entity6 's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , and @entity42 secretary of state @entity70 says the negotiations will show if that 's true because a final agreement will require @entity6 to give up the technology to develop weapons of mass destruction			1
@entity77 : @entity6 invites inspectors to visit @entity80 nuclear site the chief @entity6 nuclear negotiator , foreign minister @entity82 , joined in some of the @entity9 tweeting from @entity58			2
" may the spirit of @entity9 bring joy , peace , empathy and compassion to everyone throughout the coming year			0
merry @entity9 , " said a post on his account			0
the messages came from leaders of an @entity15 republic in which religious minorities are not completely free to participate in the @entity6 government and often face discrimination			2
while @entity101 and @entity23 can to some extent worship openly in @entity6 , the government cracks down on converts from @entity15 and any effort to proselytize faith other than @entity30			0
" there are thousands of cases of discrimination against religious minorities like the @entity114 and others who express their own beliefs or any other belief than what the theocratic regime of @entity6 impose , " noted @entity106 , the vice chairwoman of the @entity107 , in an interview last year with @entity109			0
in 2012 , @entity6 arrested @entity120 , a @entity42 citizen who is a @entity121 convert and was openly preaching his @entity121 beliefs			0
he remains imprisoned in @entity6 , and his wife and others criticized the @entity63 administration for not negotiating his release as part of the nuclear talks			1
@entity6 leaders have offered @entity9 messages in the past citing the teachings of @entity10 , who is considered a prophet in @entity15			1
former president @entity133 , a hardliner notorious for virulent @entity135 rhetoric , had on occasion issued positive statements about @entity9 or @entity138 , the @entity101 celebration of a new year			0
he was much more widely known , however , for saying that @entity60 should be eliminated and calling the @entity139 a myth			0
usually , @entity133 would caution that he was criticizing " zionists , " not all jews			0
the more moderate @entity21 easily won the june election to succeed @entity133 , then signaled a major shift when a tweet in september on his @entity147 - language account said : " as the sun is about to set here in # @entity58 i wish all jews , especially @entity6 jews , a blessed @entity138			0
" at the opening of the @entity152 that same month , @entity21 promised that @entity6 had the political will to reach nuclear agreement with the @entity42 and its allies			2
rumors that he would meet with @entity63 in @entity157 proved unfounded , but the two men spoke by telephone before @entity21 flew home -- the first direct conversation between @entity42 and @entity6 top leaders since the @entity163			1
over the weekend , @entity21 made clear his intention to ease tensions with the @entity166			0
a post on his @entity7 account declared : " we want to rebuild and improve our relations to @entity172 and @entity173 countries on a basis of mutual respect			0
" the @entity9 tweets continued the @entity6 outreach , this time joined by @entity27 , whose account included multiple tweets that implied @entity10 might side with @entity6 against what he has in the past criticized as @entity3 imperialism			1
" if # @entity10 were among us today , he would not spare even a single moment to fight the despotism & global # arrogance , " said one of the tweets on @entity27 's account			1
@entity27 's messages appeared to be an effort to communicate directly with the international community by the 74 - year - old religious cleric			0
it was impossible to know who actually writes on the @entity7 accounts of @entity21 and @entity27 , while @entity82 , a fluent @entity147 speaker , previously has said he writes his own tweets			0
just the existence of official accounts for @entity21 and @entity27 makes them authoritative in a nation where @entity7 and other social media websites such as @entity203 and @entity204 are controlled and limited			1
in an interview with @entity109 in september , @entity6 tourism minister @entity205 said he expected more openness to social media under @entity21 , a close political ally			1
" social media is actually a great tool that can be used to express beliefs and reveal the reality and truth , " @entity205 said			2
" during the previous administration , social media and the @entity6 's presence on social media was considered to be illegal			1
but i think based on the policies of the new administration , there would certainly be changes made in those limitations			0

@entity6 leaders praise @entity10 as a prophet of @entity37 's grace
tweets from the top leaders are part of new rapprochement with the @entity166
the social media outreach comes as @entity6 seeks a nuclear deal to end sanctions
international sanctions crippling @entity6 's economy are @entity6 's *motivation*
