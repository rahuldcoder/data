-- more than eight years after a @entity4 teenager disappeared from her bedroom on a summer night , the man authorities believe masterminded her kidnapping is set to stand trial in federal court			1
@entity10 , 57 , is accused of snatching then - 14 - year - old @entity11 at knifepoint from her family 's @entity14 home on june 5 , 2002 -- a crime that shocked the nation and the city , which was then basking in the glow of the @entity20 a few months earlier			1
@entity10 faces federal charges of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for improper purposes			1
jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin monday in @entity14			2
in the months that followed @entity32 's disappearance , her anguished parents , @entity28 and @entity29 , became a familiar sight in the media as they continued to plead for their daughter 's safe return			0
but no one expected what happened in march 2003 , when @entity32 was found walking down a street in the @entity14 suburb of @entity44 in the company of @entity10 and his wife , @entity46			2
@entity10 , a drifter and self - described prophet who called himself " @entity48 , " had done some handyman work at the @entity51 ' home			2
@entity4 prosecutors charged @entity10 with six felony charges of kidnapping , sexual assault and burglary			2
but in july 2005 , a @entity4 district court judge ruled him incompetent to stand trial , leaving him in custody at the @entity60			1
however , the state case against @entity10 was put on hold when federal authorities stepped in			2
a grand jury in 2008 indicted @entity10 and @entity46			1
@entity66 district judge @entity65 found @entity10 competent to stand trial in march			1
@entity46 , 64 , pleaded guilty in november 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in may to 15 years in federal prison			0
she also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap @entity32 's cousin a month after @entity32 was kidnapped			2
she was given a sentence of one to 15 years , to be served concurrently with the federal sentence , and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody			0
as part of her plea agreement , @entity46 agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband			0
however , her name does not appear on a witness list filed by federal prosecutors -- and does appear on a list of witnesses filed by the defense			0
smart , her mother and her younger sister , @entity95 -- who was sleeping in the room with @entity32 the night of the kidnapping and was the only witness -- all appear on the prosecution 's witness list			0
@entity10 's attorneys attempted to move his trial , saying it should be held outside of @entity4 because publicity in the case had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial			1
@entity65 denied that request in august , and defense attorneys appealed his ruling to the 10th @entity66 @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116			0
a three - judge panel on the appeals court denied the request last week , saying it was premature since jury selection had not taken place			1
" it is possible that a jury could be seated where all the jurors would satisfy mr. @entity10 's view of impartiality , " the 10th @entity114 ruling said			1
defense attorneys in july said in court documents that they intend to utilize an insanity defense and intend to introduce expert testimony relating to an alleged mental disease or defect			1
now 22 , @entity32 testified as part of @entity10 's competency hearing last year that after taking her -- still dressed in her red pajamas -- from her home , @entity10 took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her			1
she testified he repeatedly assaulted her during her months in captivity , and that he and @entity46 took her to @entity145 before returning with her to @entity4			0
the federal court summoned 600 jurors to fill out a preliminary juror questionnaire in the case , according to court documents			0
about 500 potential jurors attended the sessions on september 30 and october 1			0
some were released on hardship grounds , the documents said , but about 330 jurors completed the questionnaire			0
@entity65 narrowed that number down to slightly more than 200 potential jurors , according to the @entity161 newspaper .			0

@entity10 's attorneys will use insanity defense
appeals court upholds judge 's *decision* not to move trial
report : jury pool narrowed down to about 200
