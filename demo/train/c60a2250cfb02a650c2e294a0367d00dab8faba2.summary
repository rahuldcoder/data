-- just before heading to bed one night in august , i got a text message from @entity3			1
it contained a photo of first lady @entity6 in a citrus - print sleeveless sheer yoke cocktail dress			2
above it , a message : " @entity10 found out , @entity6 is wearing the yellow dress			2
" @entity3 has dressed @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , but this was different			1
there she was , @entity18 's fashion icon on @entity19 , validating @entity3 's work before a national audience			1
it is @entity3 's moment , but it 's a story that almost was n't			1
he had never been on a plane before 1995 , when he left his native @entity24 , @entity25 , at age 23 with a one - way ticket to @entity28 , @entity29 , to pursue a master 's degree in economics on an academic scholarship to @entity34			2
between homework assignments , he 'd sketch			2
until , by chance , a professor saw his sketchbook of dresses , jackets and coats and said , " you 're in the wrong business			0
" so @entity3 called his dad , who told him , " close your eyes and picture yourself 10 years from now , having the most fun , being the most happy -- that 's your answer			1
" @entity3 packed his bags , moved to @entity50 and landed a spot at the @entity52 , where he could finally pursue his lifelong passion			1
time.com : @entity52 's @entity55 : a conversation with @entity58 's @entity57 and @entity58 now 40 and a newly minted member of the @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , @entity3 launched his namesake label in 2009 after nine years at @entity62 , where he worked his way up from assistant to design director			1
" as a creative person , you want to start with a blank canvas , " he says			0
" this is like having the biggest canvas on which to paint			0
" his clothes do have a painterly quality : rich color , prints and patterns on structured silhouettes			0
there are shades of @entity25 , too , in the embroidery and beading -- traditional dressmaking techniques that @entity3 likes to call " @entity84 bones			1
" i recently paid him a visit at his cavernous , 5,000 - sq. - ft. studio in the heart of @entity91 's garment district -- a big upgrade from the cramped 600 - sq. - ft. space a block away where he used to work			0
his new spot is a sea of white walls and columns punctuated by splashes of color : a sage gown with beads and feathers from his 2013 resort collection and a chaise longue he found on the street and re-covered in lapis - print fabric of his own design			0
he greets me at the door with his signature boyish grin and a hug			0
" he has the biggest smile in fashion and lacks any of the attitude that sometimes comes with a young designer 's success , " says @entity113 , the @entity60 's ceo			1
" @entity3 is a gracious and tasteful gentleman , " says @entity119 , senior vice president of @entity120 , @entity3 's biggest account			1
" his mÃ © tier is elegance			0
" as @entity3 describes them , his designs are a study in opposites			1
" masculine and feminine , graphic and organic , but always staying true to the core of making beautiful clothes , " he says			0
he has a hat trick of debuts coming up : in september , he 'll show his first collection with handbags ; in january , his first pre-fall collection ; in february , a complete line of handbags			0
" a lot of exciting things are happening , " he says			0
" i hope to grow another head and two more hands , " he adds with a laugh , " like an @entity25 goddess			0
" to see @entity146 national correspondent @entity145 's interview with @entity3 and for more coverage of @entity148 , tune in to @entity52 : @entity150 , airing on @entity146 on saturday , sept. 15 , at 2:30 p.m. time.com : shades of autumn			2
