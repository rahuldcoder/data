-- " @entity1 " has added a little perspective to users ' gripes about the new @entity5			1
in a biting sketch on saturday 's episode , @entity6 hosts a fake talk show in which three tech bloggers voice complaints about the @entity5 : its new maps are glitchy , its camera takes purple - tinged photos , its casing scratches too easily , and so on			1
then @entity6 reveals -- surprise ! -- three other guests : " workers " from factories in @entity20 that manufacture @entity22 's phones and other consumer electronics under allegedly inhumane conditions			1
" it takes you to wrong place ? " says a factory worker played by " snl " cast member @entity26 in response to a complaint about @entity22 's buggy mobile maps			2
" you want @entity34 , it takes you to @entity35 ? that must be so hard for you			0
" this " first world problem " sarcasm , spoken in over-the - top fake @entity20 accents , continues after another blogger mentions apps loading slowly on the new phone			2
" oh , @entity42 real slow ? you ca n't read @entity46 tweet about handbag ? " says another worker			0
" my brother have handbag , too			0
he lose hand , keep in bag until he can afford to reattach			0
" ( there 's no mention by name of @entity55 , the controversial @entity56 manufacturer whose @entity20 factories produce the phones			1
a series of suicides by workers at @entity55 's plants have raised questions about living and working conditions there			2
) on " snl , " the three bloggers grow more apologetic and uncomfortable until the skit ends with @entity6 inviting the @entity20 workers to complain about an @entity71 product			1
" let 's see -- what does @entity71 make ? " says @entity26 's character			0
" does diabetes count as a product ? "			0

a " @entity1 " sketch pokes fun at bloggers ' *whining* about the @entity5
skit *contrasts* those gripes with the lives of the @entity20 factory workers who build the phones
