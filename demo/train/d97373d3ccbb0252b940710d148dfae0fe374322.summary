-- @entity1 have failed in their bid to get their 2 - 1 @entity5 home defeat to @entity6 replayed despite the controversial ' ghost ' goal scored by visiting striker @entity9			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said monday the result would stand but have given @entity1 one week to appeal the decision			1
high flying @entity6 were winning the ninth round match on october 18 by a single goal in the 70th minute when @entity9 headed a corner just wide of the home goal			1
@entity17 international striker @entity9 was seen with his head in his hands , apparently acknowledging a bad miss , but the ball found its way into the net through a hole in the side netting			2
it was enough to convince referee @entity27 that the effort was legitimate and to the dismay of all concerned he awarded the goal			0
@entity6 , pushing @entity31 and @entity32 hard at the top of the standings , eventually claimed three valuable points in a 2 - 1 win , but it has come at a cost			1
@entity9 , bidding for a regular place up front in the @entity17 international team for the @entity40 in @entity41 , has been subjected to much criticism and there have been renewed demands for @entity45 to introduce video technology to help referees in such situations			0
after a 90 - minute hearing in @entity51 , the head of the @entity10 tribunal , judge @entity49 said they had been left with " no alternative " but to uphold the original result			2

" from a legal point of view , there is no alternative			0
there are no grounds for the appeal			0
the factual decision may have been incorrect , but it is irrevocable			0
" @entity1 cited an incident in a match between @entity31 and @entity74 in 1994 when @entity31 's @entity75 scored a similar ' ghost ' goal in a 2 - 1 win			1
