the @entity0 on wednesday dismissed an @entity2 threat to deploy warships near the @entity5 coast , and military experts said @entity2 lacks the naval capability to do so			1
overnight tuesday , @entity2 state news quoted a commander as saying his country plans to have a " powerful presence " near the @entity5 border			1
in response , @entity0 spokesman @entity13 said that " we do n't take these statements seriously , given that they do not reflect at all @entity2 's naval capabilities			1
" @entity20 spokesman @entity19 echoed @entity13 's point , saying @entity2 has the right to send vessels into international waters , but " whether they can truly project naval power beyond the region is another question			1
" " i would n't read too much into what came out of @entity2 today , " @entity19 said , adding : " i think what is said and what is actually done can be two different things			2
" state - run @entity33 in @entity2 said similar plans were announced in july			1
however , no @entity2 warships ever deployed			0
in february , two @entity2 navy vessels traversed the @entity37 in the first such voyage by @entity2 ships since 1979			2
@entity40 , director of the @entity41 at the @entity42 , said @entity2 's navy is too small with too miniscule a budget to remain for long off the @entity5 coast			1
" this is hard to take seriously , because @entity2 's navy is very small			1
this force , whatever it may be , is going to be puny , especially compared to the @entity54 , " said @entity47 , who specializes in the use of imagery and posturing in international conflicts			0
" @entity2 does n't have the capability to come within close proximity to ( the @entity5 ) to conduct hostile activities			1
even if ( @entity2 ) launched missiles , we would sink their ships immediately			2
" @entity2 lacks battleships or aircraft carriers			0
its forces are capable of patrolling the @entity64 and sailing a short distance in the @entity66 , @entity47 said , but keeping ships stationed near the @entity5 , so far from @entity2 , would be too expensive for the government			1
" they would need a place to resupply , refuel , restock crews with food and water			0
they could n't afford that unless they got help , " @entity47 said			0
" i would imagine they could get help from somewhere in @entity80 , maybe @entity81			0
" @entity81 and @entity2 are allied by their anti- @entity5 sentiments			2
@entity83 , the director of the @entity2 studies program at @entity85 , a @entity86 - area think tank that specializes in naval analyses , agreed with @entity47			2
" their navy ca n't reach our coastline right now , " @entity83 said , describing the @entity2 announcement as " bombastic rhetoric			2
" " it 's posturing " by @entity2 intended for both its domestic and regional audience , @entity83 said			0
making such pronouncements projects a dominant role including naval power , whether or not they can back it up , he added			0
" the @entity2 have been historically annoyed that we have a naval presence in the @entity64 , which is kind of their backyard , " @entity83 said			2
the worst move the @entity5 could make now would be to overreact , said @entity106 , the @entity107 chair of national security studies at @entity41			0
" hopefully this wo n't play into ( @entity5 ) neo-cons who are itching for a war with @entity2 , " he said			1
" the best thing to do is ignore it and treat it with the contempt it deserves			0
if @entity2 wants to waste their time and money on a dwindling supply of fuel ( to keep ships ) bobbing around in the @entity124 , then let them			0
" the idea of @entity2 moving ships near the @entity5 coast is not on par with the @entity130 flying planes off the coast of @entity133 during the @entity134 , @entity106 noted			1
the @entity130 ' move was legal , and was considered a gesture intended to irritate the @entity5 , he said			0
" those were different circumstances and different players , " @entity106 added			0
@entity47 cautioned that while moving ships near the @entity5 coast may not be a real threat , @entity2 is certainly capable of harming the @entity5 -- but closer to @entity2			1
@entity2 could attack @entity5 ships in the @entity142 , a waterway between the @entity64 of @entity143 and the @entity64 , on the south coast of @entity2			1
such attacks could disrupt oil markets and scare @entity5 tourists , @entity47 said .			0

miltiary experts say @entity2 is *incapable* of deploying ships off the @entity5 coast
