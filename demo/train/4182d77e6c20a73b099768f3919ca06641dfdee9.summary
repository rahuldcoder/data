-- the homicide rate in @entity3 's most violent city -- @entity4 -- is down , according to @entity3 president @entity5 , but some residents of the city are not convinced			1
" we are facing an entirely political statement , which is not based on reality			0
a statistic must be considered as a long process and not in a comparison of one month to another , " @entity4 criminologist @entity10 said			1
over the weekend , @entity5 said homicides had fallen by 60 % in @entity4 since last october , comparing statistics from that month with april 's numbers			1
speaking during an event that commemorated the city 's 100th anniversary and its participation in the @entity22 , @entity5 said @entity4 was " going through a time of darkness " and defended his crime - fighting strategy			1
" there are probably variations and jumps [ in the murder rate ] because the evil of criminals are still there , but we must persevere in our efforts , " he said			0
but several days after @entity5 's departure , some residents remained skeptical of his assessment			1
" the president just came here and ( violence ) went down , but to say 60 or 70 % is a lie -- he just left and the violence continues , " @entity4 resident @entity38 told @entity0			1
" you have seen what has happened in the past and it will continue and continue and ( @entity5 ) will leave			1
they 're just words ... it 's a lie			2
" university professor @entity50 cautioned that the government should take a more measured approach			0
" it seemed to me that the tone of the speech was very triumphant , and it should have been more moderate , because we have already had other moments in which it seems there a slight decrease in the situation , and later it picks up again , " he said			0
october 2010 saw a record of 359 homicides in the city , according to figures kept by the @entity67 state attorney general 's office			1
the deadliest month was followed by 198 homicides in november and 213 in december			0
the pace of homicides continued into the @entity71 , with 215 killed in january and 231 in february			0
in march and april 2011 there were 176 and 271 homicides , respectively			2
in his speech , @entity5 used figures from the country 's public safety secretary , which said there had been 166 homicides in april and 417 in october 2010			1
the state attorney general 's office said there has been a marked decrease in homicides in may , with 118 victims so far			2
@entity10 said the recent decline is due to multiple factors , but not to police or intelligence strategies of government officials			0
" violence is down at the border , but they have killed many people			2
people with resources have gone , or are paying an extortion fee , but i do not see any strategy that is working , " @entity10 said			2
to accurately measure a trend , it 's necessary to compare rates over a one - year period , not month to month , @entity10 said			0
" we have to recognize that the economy has not improved , the shops are closed -- that is the most valid demonstration			0
the effect is not just felt in terms of border killings , but also kidnapping , extortion and assaults , " he added			1
during @entity5 's visit , state officials said they were beginning a new effort to help re-brand the city 's violent image : changing its name			1
government officials approved a name change to " @entity120 " to emphasize the city 's participation in the @entity22 , but only as a symbolical slogan and not for official purposes , said @entity125 , coordinator with the office of @entity67 state representatives			0
homicides in @entity4 , which borders @entity129 , @entity130 , are often attributed to two violent drug cartels battling for turf in the city			2
@entity4 is the city with the highest number of homicides in @entity3 , with a record 8,000 victims since 2008 , according to the @entity67 state attorney general 's office			1
but this week , the city saw a brief respite			0
for 28 hours , between 7 p.m. monday and 11 p.m. tuesday , there were no reports of homicides			0
journalist @entity143 contributed to this report .			0
