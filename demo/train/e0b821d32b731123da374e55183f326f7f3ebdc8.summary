@entity0 , @entity1 -- a week after a building containing thousands of @entity1 garment workers came crashing down around them , the death toll from the @entity6 nation 's deadliest industrial disaster rose above 400			2
workers using heavy machinery are gradually picking apart the huge , splintered slabs of concrete at the scene of the collapse in @entity0 , a suburb of the capital , @entity17			2
they continue to find and remove bodies , many of them decomposed and difficult to recognize			2
meanwhile , throngs of mourners attended a funeral for 32 unidentified victims whose bodies were unclaimed			1
and @entity28 , speaking at a @entity27 on wednesday , referred to the building collapse in a sharp condemnation of worker exploitation and " slave labor			1
" " not paying a just ( wage ) , not providing work , focusing exclusively on the balance books , on financial statements , only looking at making personal profit			2
that goes against @entity39 ! " he said , quoted on the @entity42 website			2
the collapse of the building has caused widespread anger among @entity1 's millions of garment workers about the risky conditions in which many of them must work			2
anger in @entity1 focuses on building owner , rejection of aid frequent protests , some of them involving violent clashes with police , have taken place in @entity17 and nearby manufacturing districts since the disaster			2
on wednesday , when workers around the world were holding @entity63 rallies , thousands of @entity1 took to the streets once again , although no clashes were initially reported			2
as trucks carrying rubble leave the scene of the catastrophe , people search desperately for missing relatives crowd around them , wanting to make sure they 're not mistakenly taking away the bodies of their loved ones , said maj. gen. @entity75 , the military official leading the recovery efforts			1
there was confusion earlier about exactly how many people were still unaccounted for in the collapse , @entity75 said at a news briefing wednesday			1
authorities were waiting for the @entity83 to provide a list of all the people who were inside the five garment factories in the building when it caved in , he said			1
when that information was obtained , @entity75 said it appeared about 149 people were still missing			1
" it is very unlikely that someone is still alive under the rubble on the seventh day of the building collapse ... but the almighty @entity97 knows better , " the military official said			1
authorities say the number of people confirmed dead so far is 412 , while 2,443 people have been recovered alive , according to the official @entity102			1
and so , the search for the human remains still entombed within the ruins goes on amid the stench of death that pervades the site			0
those involved in the search are using face masks and cans of air freshener to try to block out the smell , and electronic sensors and sniffer dogs to try to find the bodies			0
col. @entity117 , one of the officials involved in the operation , said wednesday that he believed the grueling , painstaking efforts could continue for about 10 more days			1
" it is a delicate and time - consuming operation , but we are doing everything we can , " he said			0
after building collapse , @entity125 's death breaks rescuers ' hearts lost relatives meanwhile , hundreds of people such as sheikh @entity131 are left in limbo			1
at the school playground in @entity0 where bodies recovered from the wreckage are initially brought for identification , @entity131 said he had being looking for his nephew , @entity137 , for the past week			1
he said visits to all the hospitals in @entity0 and @entity17 where the injured and the dead were taken had proved fruitless			1
" nobody can tell me about my nephew , who was working at an apparel factory in the building , " he said			0
much of the rage voiced in protests has been directed at @entity147 , the owner of the building , who was arrested near the @entity150 border over the weekend			0
protesters have called for him to be hanged			0
@entity147 and the owners of the factories in his building have been accused of ordering workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse , despite the discovery of large cracks the day before			0
@entity160 face tough choices over @entity1 the @entity1 government is also coming under criticism for lax enforcement of safety regulations in factories and claims by @entity168 and the @entity169 that it refused offers of help with rescue efforts			0
home minister @entity174 said tuesday that the rejection was because @entity1 had only wanted equipment to be sent , not the additional search and rescue experts offered by the outside agencies			0
@entity179 considers trade action in a sign of the growing international pressure on @entity17 to improve labor conditions , the @entity179 said tuesday that it was considering trade action against @entity1			1
the statement carries weight , since the @entity179 is @entity1 's largest trade partner			0
the @entity1 government said this week that it would begin inspecting the safety and security of all garment factories in the country			0
major @entity192 retailers and clothing brands , some of which sourced products from the factories in the collapsed building , are also facing difficult questions about how closely they scrutinize working conditions at their suppliers			0
" we understand that businesses operating in this building appear to have links to numerous companies in the @entity160 and @entity208 and so we 'll continue to engage with @entity160 companies to discuss what role they can play in improving working conditions , including in @entity1 , " @entity203 spokesman @entity202 said wednesday			0
the catastrophic building collapse happened about five months after a fire at @entity214 , a garment maker in another suburb of @entity17 , killed at least 112 people			1
