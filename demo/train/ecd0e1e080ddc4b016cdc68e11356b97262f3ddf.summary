-- while most first - person shooter games want players to kill as a means of completing a mission , " @entity9 " takes that premise to the next level by having players " kill with skill			1
" the new first - person shooter from @entity12 , @entity10 and @entity13 ends up being a campy , over-the - top offering , featuring a new game play style that awards points for killing enemies in unique ways			1
the more outlandishly someone dies , the more skillshot points you get			1
you play as @entity22 , an assassin - turned - mercenary who is on a mission to redeem himself by going after the people who used him to kill innocents			1
sound convoluted ? there are enough twists , turns , betrayals and unlikely partnerships that it feels like you will end up targeting everyone at some point in the game			2
that mounting body count , which is the game 's true lead character , is n't just about using different weapons to off your opponents , but includes using the environment around you to deal death blows			1
spiked cacti and steel beams become your friends for the " spiked " or " @entity50 " skillshot points			2
kicking an opponent off a high platform earns you the " @entity55 " skillshot points			2
players can cash in the points for upgrades to weapons and a special device called the @entity61			1
it 's a wrist device that shoots out an energy tendril , allowing @entity22 to pull enemies or items toward him			1
you can also use the @entity67 feature of the leash to fling people into the air , where you can pick them off and earn " @entity72 " points			2
@entity22 starts off the game with a standard assault rifle , but other weapons are found throughout the scenes			1
my favorite ended up being the @entity79 , which fires off two bombs attached together by a chain			0
wrap up an enemy , kick him into a crowd of bad guys , and then set off the bombs			0
it clears out a room quickly and will earn you points for the " @entity91 " skill or the " @entity90 " skill			2
get the idea ? the more creatively a player uses his weapons and surroundings , the better his weapons become and the more destructive he can be			2
instead of just mowing down enemy after enemy , i found myself taking a few extra moments to survey what was around me and how i could use it to destroy others			0
the wanton mayhem is n't the only thing that 's over the top in " @entity9			1
" dialogue is one obscenity after another in some of the most outlandish ways			2
obviously , they are all @entity111 ( or for any real conversation ) , but they are laugh - out - loud funny if you keep your tongue firmly in your cheek			0
there is no real character development or even an attempt at real interaction between @entity22 and the nonplayer characters that will help you along the way			1
also , do n't worry about trying to figure out where to go next			0
the nonplayer characters will lead the way and then stop right before heading into a danger zone			0
there are also indicators along the way ( like a message telling you to press " b " to kick open a door ) that lead the player by the hand through the linear game play			0
single - player maps can be replayed after completion to see if you can improve your skillshot score in a timed setting			0
multiplayer action ramps things up by introducing three team members to destroy the bad guys with you			0
the play is the same , but team skillshots are introduced to add a bit of spice			0
cooperation is needed to move along , so play with people who will work with you rather than go off on their own			0
" @entity9 " is an entertaining attempt at making bloody fun with the skillshot feature			1
i think of it as a teenage shooter game that tries to get attention by being gross , obscene and sexually charged			0
it is funny at first , but after a while , it becomes tired -- especially the dialogue			0
but the shooting aspect is really something new and does keep interest levels high			0
even toward the end of the game , i was still figuring out new combinations of weapons and environment that unlocked more new skillshot points			1
if you go into " @entity9 " thinking it is an elite first - person shooter game , you will be very disappointed			1
however , " @entity9 , " with its " kill with skill " mentality , is a great change of pace in the first - person shooter genre that rewards players for doing something different			1
" @entity9 " is now available on the @entity182 , @entity183 and pc			1
it is rated m for mature because of blood and gore , intense violence , partial nudity , sexual themes , strong language and use of alcohol			0
this review was done playing a retail copy on the @entity182 .			0

" @entity9 " follows @entity22 , an assassin - turned - mercenary
in the game , the more outlandish the killing , the more points you get
it is not only about using the different weapons , but also the environment
