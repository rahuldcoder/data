-- it 's been almost a decade since the @entity2 accused @entity3 of actively working on a secret program to develop nuclear weapons			1
since then , @entity3 has steadfastly proclaimed to a skeptical world that it only seeks to produce nuclear energy , while @entity2 presidents have repeatedly warned that the @entity2 will not tolerate a nuclear - armed @entity3			1
over the years , the international community has demanded , to no avail , that @entity11 end its uranium enrichment program			0
@entity3 's defiance , coupled with its threats to destroy @entity15 , have led @entity15 to consider the option of a pre-emptive strike			1
world powers have repeated their preference for a diplomatic solution reached through " sustained dialogue " as the possibility of negotiations surfaces once again			0
the statement came after @entity3 indicated it might let @entity26 inspectors visit the military facility at @entity28 , from which it had recently blocked them			1
but negotiations have failed many times without slowing @entity3 's enrichment activities			1
the risk is increasing as the @entity26 nuclear agency chief expresses renewed concern about @entity3 's nuclear intentions			1
@entity37 , the head of the @entity38 , said wednesday that , " @entity3 has engaged in activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices			2
" @entity42 : are sanctions leading to war ? tension is high			0
president @entity47 's meeting with @entity15 prime minister @entity48 this week did not produce any breakthrough			2
no one knows how the standoff over @entity3 's nuclear program will unfold			1
but some possible scenarios have crossed people 's minds			2
@entity3 backs down and opens up to diplomacy			2
under the weight of sanctions and the threat of war , @entity3 's leaders agree to a softened version of the @entity26 demands			1
the theocracy survives , war is avoided and the opposition remains weak under the @entity67 ' heels , hoping to rise up another day			2
watching the negotiations drag on and the advances made in @entity3 's nuclear program , @entity15 decides that it can not trust president @entity47 to " always have @entity15 's back			1
" @entity15 fighter jets , flying with permission from @entity76 across @entity76 airspace , launch a bombing campaign against fortified @entity3 nuclear targets			1
or , president @entity47 , who has consistently expressed his preference for diplomacy , could reach a point where he believes diplomacy has failed and force , a last resort , has to be used			0
the @entity2 attacks @entity3 without @entity26 support ( @entity87 and @entity88 indignantly object ) but with the backing of @entity91 allies ( though not @entity92 because @entity93 indignantly objects			0
) some @entity95 countries quietly cheer from the sidelines hoping to see their historic @entity98 rival pushed back			0
if either @entity15 or the @entity2 attacks , @entity3 's nuclear installations are destroyed			1
the regime is weakened and eventually a somewhat more @entity103 - friendly government takes power			0
the new government says @entity3 has a right to nuclear power , but decides it 's a bad idea to pursue a nuclear program for the time being			1
alternatively , @entity3 doggedly fights back with allied militias in @entity112 and @entity113 attacking @entity15			1
the war lasts longer than anyone expected			0
chaos descends on the @entity117			0
@entity15 civilians move to underground shelters			0
@entity3 's nuclear program is set back but the regime survives , vowing revenge toward the attackers			1
the country remains a perpetrator and sponsor of terrorism around the world but it is no longer capable of enriching uranium			0
@entity3 reaches ability to make a bomb			0
@entity3 manages to achieve " breakout " nuclear capability , accumulating everything it needs to assemble a nuclear bomb			2
@entity15 's security concerns are heightened			2
its rival neighbors in @entity95 countries and in @entity93 rush to catch up			0
the chances of wars and conflicts in the @entity117 increase			0
@entity76 , the @entity142 , @entity143 and others try to acquire nuclear weapons			0
the world becomes a less safe place as barriers against nuclear proliferation become less effective			0
@entity150 : will @entity3 cost @entity47 the presidency ? 4			0
@entity3 calls the world 's bluff			2
the diplomatic dance of threats , sanctions and speeches goes on until one day @entity3 announces that the @entity158 has been restored to its old glory			0
@entity3 has a nuclear bomb and anyone who dares challenge it will be dispatched to the afterlife			2
@entity76 , @entity93 , @entity164 and others feel vulnerable next to a nuclear capable @entity11			0
they try to build their own nuclear weapons			0
emboldened by its ability , @entity3 's rhetoric becomes more defiant			1
calls for @entity15 's destruction are regularly interspersed with mocking statements about @entity95 leaders who are friendly to the @entity69 or , worse , those who support peace with @entity15			1
@entity3 's threat to " wipe @entity15 off the map " hangs in the air			1
war becomes unavoidable , but by now it 's a war between nuclear - armed nations			2
undoubtedly , no one wants another war			0
but @entity3 's pursuit and acquisition of nuclear weapons could ultimately prove more catastrophic for the @entity117 , the @entity69 and the entire world			1
the international community must find a way to end @entity3 's nuclear program			1
after 10 years of threats and warnings , @entity11 may no longer believe that it has to give up its nuclear program			1
the only way war may be avoided is if @entity3 believes an attack from the @entity69 is a real possibility			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0
