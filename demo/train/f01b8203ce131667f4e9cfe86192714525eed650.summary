-- i wish the titans of @entity3 could meet @entity4			1
not that it would be likely to change anything			2
but i wish the leaders of @entity8 and of the other big banking firms could talk to @entity4 for just a few minutes			2
they might learn a few things about how to better connect with the @entity12 people			2
i did n't know @entity4 's last name until a few days ago			1
for almost two years , i 've held onto something he mailed to me			2
there was no reason not to throw it out , yet i had a feeling that someday i 'd want to refer to it			2
with the public 's wariness of @entity3 growing , with @entity8 being accused of fraud by the @entity25 ( even as @entity8 was announcing first - quarter profits of $ 3.46 billion , nearly twice as much as in the first quarter a year ago ) , with investors wondering if they 're being given a fair shake by the firms to which they have entrusted their money , @entity4 's way of doing business might be worthy of at least a moment 's attention			1
i came across him quite by chance			2
i occasionally purchase used books -- titles that have gone out of print			0
sometimes i will place my orders through @entity38 , which offers an online marketplace for local used - book merchants around the country			1
in 2008 , i found a book i was looking for on that @entity38 marketplace , and submitted an order			1
the price was more than reasonable : $ 6.95 for the used hardcover			0
used books are not shipped by @entity38 itself , but by the local booksellers			0
a week or so after i placed the order , the package arrived , from @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54			0
the book seemed to be in good shape			1
but with it was a personal letter to me			0
it said : " thank your for your recent book order			1
i have enclosed a check to you for $ 2.95			0
the reason for this is that this book is only in ' very good ' condition , while i mistakenly described it as being in ' @entity69 ' condition in my listing			1
please accept my apologies for the error			0
( also , please note , the soiling that you see on the dust jacket is actually on the @entity77 and not the dust jacket itself			0
) " he wrote that he hoped his apology and the refund were satisfactory			1
sure enough , tucked into the book was a check made out to me , for $ 2.95			1
i was surprised by the gesture			0
yes , in his online listing for the book he had said it was in " @entity69 " condition , but who really knows what those designations mean ? you see them all the time describing used books : " fair , " " good , " " very good , " " @entity69 , " " @entity99 " -- they would seem to be approximations			1
i had no complaints about the condition of the book i had bought from him			1
if i had paid $ 6.95 , and he had refunded $ 2.95 , and @entity38 had taken its commission , how was he supposed to make a living ? i mailed his check back to him , thanking him for it and telling him how impressed i was with the way he did business			1
i told him i could not accept the refund			1
and for some reason , i could n't toss the letter			0
it made me feel hopeful about certain things			0
with @entity3 losing people 's confidence in recent days over the way it is alleged to treat its customers ' money , i got the letter out again			1
he had just signed it " @entity125 " ; i was able to find him in @entity53 , which is how i found out that he was @entity4			0
he seemed as surprised to be hearing from me as i was when i had gotten his refund check			1
he 's 42 years old ; @entity130 is the street on which he lives , and his used books -- about 4,000 of them at last count -- are kept in his garage			1
business , he said , is not so good			2
" i 'm pretty small - time , " he said			0
" when i first started doing this about three years ago , i was selling 15 or 20 books a day			0
but now , that 's down to 15 or 20 books every few days			2
" he said that his wife is a schoolteacher ; without her salary , he could n't make it			0
he said he tries to run his business professionally and in good faith , but is finding that the results " are pretty pathetic , dollar-wise			2
" i asked him the question that had been in the back of my mind since i first heard from him : as he was struggling to make a living , why , exactly , on my $ 6.95 order , had he decided to send me that refund check for $ 2.95 ? he could n't have been making much of a profit on the order in the first place			2
" i just try to do things right , " he said			0
" when i went to mail that book to you , i must have noticed that it was n't in as good a condition as i had promised on my @entity38 listing			2
i want my customers to be happy and to believe i 'm being fair with them			1
" such a simple proposition			0
yet with the financial news we 've become conditioned to reading about			0
. i asked @entity4 if he had been following the recent reports from @entity3			1
" i suppose if you 're in charge of a multi-billion dollar bank -- billions in profits , millions in bonuses -- maybe you can lose sight of where you came from , " he said			0
as for his own business : " i know i 'm doing it right in how i treat my customers , and that gives me peace of mind , but it 's not generating the results i had hoped			1
" he said he is considering looking for some other kind of work			0
i thanked him again for that letter he had sent to me two years ago , and he thanked me again for remembering			0
by his own admission , as a businessman he lacks the killer instinct , the appetite for working the angles ; he would undoubtedly be an abject failure on @entity3			1
if only it were n't so			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			1

@entity192 : @entity3 is being accused of shady business practices
@entity192 : book ***dealer*** *demonstrates* how a business can care for customers
@entity192 says the ***dealer*** sent an *unsolicited* refund when there was really no need to do so
book ***dealer*** says he wants customers to be happy and to believe he 's fair
