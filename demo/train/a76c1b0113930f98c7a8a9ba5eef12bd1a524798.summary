thanks to technology , most of us now have the ability to shoot and edit long , high - quality videos on our phones , to upload them and to share them socially with everyone we know			1
but somehow , the hot social media trend is supershort video clips that are much closer to the @entity10 than to " @entity11			2
" in the past few years , a number of companies have launched around mobile video - sharing -- among them @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity19 's own looping , six - second @entity20 -- all vying for the unofficial title , " the @entity22 of video			1
" these apps have bred a unique category of content , from real - life moments such as blowing out birthday candles to short - form artistic creations that play with the medium			1
now rumors are swirling that the next contender in this growing field will be instagram itself			0
the popular photo - sharing app is expected to unveil a video - sharing feature thursday during a press event at @entity38 , its parent company , according to reports on @entity40 , @entity41 and other tech blogs			1
not to be outdone , @entity20 seems to be readying some new features itself			1
the app 's co-founders posted several @entity47 wednesday that suggest users will soon have the ability to save drafts , splice bits of multiple @entity47 together and browse content based on categories and genres			0
so , a social - video turf war may be looming : @entity22 vs. @entity20			1
there 's no word yet on what time limits or filters @entity22 might place on a video - sharing tool			1
but on other platforms , the short clips have proven to be hugely creative , offering up bizarre snippets of art and fleeting peeks into people 's lives			1
@entity20 correctly predicted that its shorter form would result in artsy videos along with the usual clips of celebrities and cute animals			1
" the appeal ( of ) short video apps are well ... they 're short ! " said @entity20 user @entity76 in an e-mail to @entity78			1
" you do n't have to sit there for a long time to watch it			0
and due to the length , you can watch many videos in ( a ) short time span			1
" " @entity20 is immediate and to - the - point			2
the audience can view content quickly and consume multiple videos / stories in a short period of time , " agreed @entity20 user @entity88 , who believes the six - second limit " forces the user to capture the defining elements of a story or concept			1
" among the most successful clips on @entity20 are stop - motion videos , animations and how - tos			1
there are unexpected uses of the form , such as this @entity107 that cycles through a loop of answers			0
many people turn the camera on themselves , giving new dimension to the overplayed " selfie " and fleshing out their @entity19 persona with a real voice			2
as it turns out , a vine is even the perfect length for covering a rodeo			0
@entity121 's @entity120 uses the app heavily to round up the best performances at local rodeo events			0
what 's impressive is how much can be packed into these short moments			2
@entity16 and @entity20 enforce the shorter - is - better philosophy			2
@entity20 has had success with six seconds , a length @entity19 settled on after testing videos between four and 10 seconds long			1
" posts on @entity20 are about abbreviation -- the shortened form of something larger , " said @entity20 co-founder @entity131 in the blog post announcing the app. " they 're little windows into the people , settings , ideas and objects that make up your life			1
" @entity16 has gone the opposite direction , expanding its initial 15 - second time limit to 30 seconds in response to interest from its users			0
most people post clips of life events , scenes , pieces of conversation or fun action , said @entity158 , chairman of @entity159			0
" life keeps on going past six ( seconds ) , " he said in an interview with @entity78			0
@entity20 has passed 13 million users			2
earlier this month , @entity19 released an @entity165 version of its @entity20 app and it quickly became more popular than @entity22 as a way to share media on @entity19 , according to analytics site @entity170			1
as @entity172 discovered long ago , there seems to be an insatiable hunger for online video			0
in may alone , @entity175 watched 41 billion videos online			0
the format also can be very lucrative , especially when the content is created for free by third parties			0
so how will all these services make money off small videos ? @entity19 could offer promoted @entity47 , like it does with tweets			0
but where people have finished reading a promoted tweet by the time they realize it 's paid , clicking on a @entity20 and watching it requires an extra step that might lose people			1
alternatively , @entity19 could include ads in the videos themselves			0
@entity172 has had success with ads inserted at the beginning , or middle , of a user - uploaded video			2
but the new crop of social video is so short that any ads would have to get their message across in just a few seconds			2
" we 're taking a more cautious approach because a traditional 15 - 30 second pre-roll is not going to work on a 30 - second video , " said @entity16 's @entity158			0
it makes sense that @entity38 would want to get in on the micro-video trend , and choosing @entity22 as the tool for shooting and sharing these videos is natural			1
more than 100 million people use @entity22 each month , uploading a staggering 40 million photos a day			1
@entity38 , looking for ways to boost its mobile revenue , may eventually want to add short ads to @entity22 videos			1
meanwhile , fans of the short - video format will keep pushing the boundaries of what is possible			2
and the apps ' social aspects connect them to other like - minded people			2
" think of how @entity19 has evolved			0
we have learned to fit often - complex statements into ... ( 140 ) characters , " said @entity88 , the @entity20 user			1
" sometimes we chop bits out , or make up new words -- the rules are loose , and great @entity19 users have a knack for exploiting this			0
@entity20 is heading in a similar way			2
the message needs to be immediate and without embellishment			0
" " it 's not just a video tool			0
it 's a social community , " said @entity20 user @entity243			1
" the interaction is unbelievable			0
i 've come to know people up there from all over the world ... people that i would now consider friends			0
it 's actually pretty crazy how it has connected people			0

micro-video apps like @entity20 have become hugely popular
the video snippets people upload are creative , raw and frequently bizarre
@entity22 could be the next service to add short videos
user : a short video " forces the user to capture the defining elements of a story or concept "
