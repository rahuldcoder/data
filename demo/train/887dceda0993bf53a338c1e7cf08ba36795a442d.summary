-- on the northern banks of the @entity2 outside @entity3 , a soft tide laps against the perimeter of @entity7 's latest multi-billion dollar development project			1
situated just 25 miles downriver from the ornate splendor of the @entity10 and the suave sophistication of the @entity12 , the @entity8 is a new deep - sea container port that will welcome its first vessel at the beginning of november			1
the 995 acre site has taken more than three years to construct , carries a price tag of Â £ 1.5 billion ( $ 2.4 billion ) and has the advanced technological capabilities to host the ever increasing heft of the world 's biggest ships			1
see also : where is the world 's busiest airport although other @entity7 container ports such as @entity26 have greater capacity -- processing 3.74 million @entity28 ( 20 - foot @entity29 ) in 2011 , according to the @entity30 , compared to @entity8 's 3.5 million @entity28 annual limit -- the team behind the @entity2 project believe their location and state - of - the - art facilities will give them a competitive edge			1
" this will be a world class port that the @entity7 will be proud of , a national asset , " said @entity8 ceo , @entity37			2
" ( we 're ) trying to bring the biggest ships in the world as close as we can to the biggest point of consumption which is here and in the southeast			2
" bigger and better ? a pier 2.7 kilometers ( 1.68 miles ) long with six separate deep - water berths ensures giant vessels like the @entity51 and the recently launched @entity52 of ships -- which require deeper berths and giant high - speed cranes to reach across vast vessel decks -- will be able to dock there ( although there are currently no arrangements for the @entity60 to come to the @entity7 )			2
an extensive new set of road , railway and hinterland infrastructure services , meanwhile , will keep all goods moving rapidly towards their final destinations			0
see also : 8 of the world 's biggest infrastructure projects according to @entity8 supply chain manager , @entity72 , it is important the @entity7 has these advanced facilities to ensure it is n't cut off or isolated from its trading partners			1
" the ships that are out there are getting bigger and it 's necessary that we have this kind of infrastructure to handle the @entity7 's global trade , " @entity72 said			0
as it stands , only a handful of other ports around the world have the infrastructure to host behemoths like the @entity60 and @entity51			0
the @entity60 is currently the world 's largest vessel , stretching 400 meters in length with a record container capacity of 18,000 teus			1
although it was only delivered in june there are already rumors of even bigger ships in the pipeline			0
in an interview with @entity0 earlier this year @entity52 's @entity97 , @entity98 , said the @entity101 firm will seek to utilize the @entity52 over other vessels in the @entity52 fleet on its @entity104 to @entity106 route because they are cheaper to operate , provide greater economies of scale and are more fuel efficient			0
a knock - on effect of such policies , some industry experts claim , is that ports along the way will have to adapt their facilities ( or start from scratch in the case of @entity8 ) to cater for the increased importance of these giant ships			1
see also : introducing the world 's biggest ship according to professor @entity123 of @entity125 's @entity124 , the largest ports will be forced to react purely because of the market influence of large firms such as @entity52			1
" in the case of @entity52 being the first to ( introduce these large ships ) bigger ports will have to respond as they wield such clout , especially in that market of @entity104 and @entity106 , " @entity123 said			0
he points to a dispute between @entity52 and the @entity134 in the year 2000 when the @entity101 firm moved its local operations to nearby @entity136 as a warning of what may happen if ports do n't respond to the needs of the biggest shipping companies			0
ports of call while some are convinced that larger ships will have a huge impact on future port development , others are n't so sure			2
@entity149 , the author of the " @entity150 : how the @entity155 made the @entity156 and the @entity157 , " believes larger ships wo n't necessarily mean all ports have to invest in new dredging or crane facilities or face being cast adrift			2
" the ship lines would like to promote the idea that a port that ca n't cater for the very largest vessels would be in trouble , " he explained , " ( but ) there is already a significant problem with overcapacity at ports around the world			1
" @entity169 also points out that there are limitations on where the largest ships can travel that limits their use outside of very particular routes			2
the triple e class is too big for any port in the @entity179 whilst the very largest ships still wo n't be able to fit through the @entity180 even after its $ 5.25 billion expansion is completed later this year			1
see also : can @entity182 cut city traffic the changing nature of global trade meanwhile means that in years to come the busy @entity104 to @entity106 routes may not be as important as they are today			0
" we are already seeing that important pieces of manufacturing are beginning to shift from @entity192 and @entity193 to @entity194 , " @entity169 said			0
" @entity194 's ports are n't in a position to have @entity197 they 're going to have smaller vessels that can service the @entity199 of the @entity179 and @entity106 as there will be a lot of trade there			0
" " the @entity204 and similarly large ships will be important going forward but there are going to be vessels of smaller sizes that will still have an important role within the industry , " he added .			0

@entity8 is a new deep water container port on the @entity2 near @entity3
the giant facility will be able to cater for the world 's largest ships
many existing ports are being forced to adapt their facilities to cope with the ever increasing size of container ships
