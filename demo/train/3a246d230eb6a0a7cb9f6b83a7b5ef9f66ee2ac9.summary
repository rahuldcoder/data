@entity0 -- as the attention of the rugby world is drawn to @entity0 this weekend for the @entity5 , corporations are looking to capitalize on a sport that soon will become an @entity8 event			1
two dozen teams will pound the pitch , put in flying tackles and perhaps lose teeth in an effort to claim the 2012 championship trophy			0
for the @entity17 team , it 's time to defend last year 's victory			0
for spectators , it 's a chance to run up a credit card bill on beer and bizarre costumes			0
but for @entity25 , this year 's tournament marks its return to the stands as a sponsor after a 17 - year hiatus			1
" there 's more to sports than just the players on the field -- there 's the financial funding , " said @entity30 , the captain of the @entity17			2
" if a sponsorship deal is held in high esteem , potential sponsors are going be sure the money they invest is put in the right places			2
" but is the right place the @entity44 ? @entity25 thinks so			1
even as the bank is cutting tens of thousands of jobs worldwide , @entity25 is investing in rugby ahead of the sport 's inclusion in the @entity50			1
" @entity5 has changed enormously			1
the @entity54 is a very popular tournament but was much more standalone than it is now , " said @entity51 , @entity25 head of @entity53			2
" that and its upcoming inclusion in the @entity8 in 2016 in @entity59 have made the game much more international and much broader			2
" but while @entity25 has ramped up its sponsorship investment in @entity0 , the " world 's local bank " is winding down some of its @entity63 retail operations -- notably in @entity64 and @entity65 , while cutting 30,000 workers worldwide by the end of next year			1
all of this is a cost - cutting plan as laid out by @entity25 's chief executive @entity72 to save some $ 3.5 billion			1
@entity51 quickly defends @entity25 's sponsorship as a calculated strategy			1
" we very much regard our sponsorship as a business -- with business objectives , " he said			2
" this is not about a fun investment			0
we are targeting key demographics and key geographies			0
" it made sense for @entity25 to come back , " he added			2
" we did n't know rugby was going to grow the way it did			0
" and it has grown			0
from the @entity92 first tournament in 1976 that featured just nine teams , it now invites 24 teams spanning every continent except for @entity96			0
it now pulls in profits for @entity0 on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars			0
@entity51 declined to comment on how much @entity25 actually invests in sponsoring this year 's @entity92 but he says the bank aims for a three - to - one return on sponsorship investment			1
but it is rare for any company to know its rate of return on investment , according to one @entity0 advertising firm			1
not only that , companies may pay a prestige premium that comes with being a title sponsor for high - profile sporting events because there are so few of them			1
in @entity114 there 's only one @entity115			0
in international football , there 's only one @entity118			0
in @entity0 , there 's only one @entity120			0
so why invest in the @entity5 then ? for @entity25 , it helps target specific clients in markets like @entity0 , @entity124 and @entity125 -- hub cities the bank is targeting for growth , even as it streamlines elsewhere , @entity51 said			1
" with strong expat communities you 'll be looking at strong growth			0
" @entity25 is sharing title sponsorship of the @entity5 with @entity133 , whose global hub is @entity0			1
" we 're looking for sponsorships that really help build @entity0 and help bring people in to make the city a tourist destination , " says @entity136 , @entity133 's @entity137			0
" we target a lot of different groups , including average rugby fans around the world			0
we 're trying to promote the @entity5 to a wider audience			2
" @entity133 has been investing in the @entity92 for much of the last 35 years			0
aside from a seven - year break from 1997 to 2004 in the wake of the @entity63 financial crisis , the territory 's flagship air carrier will likely not fly away as a @entity5 sponsor soon , @entity136 said			1
while @entity25 , @entity133 and other sponsors refuse to divulge their investment or returns , @entity0 gladly throws its books wide open			1
the @entity156 says last year 's @entity5 drew in more than 21,000 spectators from overseas			2
the average @entity5 spectator from abroad spent $ 1,650 over the course of six days			2
in total , @entity0 raked in more than $ 289 million in direct economic benefit			0
companies are counting that as thousands descend on the city , more spectators may notice that @entity172 ad on the @entity173 in @entity0 's @entity170 bar district , notice the @entity133 billboard streak by on a @entity175 , or notice that red - and - white @entity25 banner flutter in the @entity168 breeze .			1

despite cuttings tens of thousands of jobs , @entity25 returns to sponsor the @entity5
profile of rugby growing with the sports inclusion in the 2016 @entity183
@entity25 says it expects a 3 - to - 1 rate of return for its sponsorship investment
*analyst* : returns for companies on sports sponsorship are " notoriously iffy "
