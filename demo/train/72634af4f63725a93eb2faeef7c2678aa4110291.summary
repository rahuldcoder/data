the burning question in the horse racing world is whether its two biggest stars will ever get together			0
while that once meant " who would win if they went head to head ? " now all the talk is about what they might produce given time and a bit of privacy			0
and , just as importantly , how much would that coupling be worth in the mega-bucks breeding stakes ? both horses have swept all before them in illustrious careers			2
@entity1 has posted nearly $ 3 million in prize money for the @entity25 stables , with an unbeaten run in 12 encounters			1
@entity2 has also done well for her owners , with 22 wins on courses in @entity31 and the @entity32 in the past four years			1
@entity1 is now rated as the best performer on the flat in the world by race statistics company @entity36 -- which since 1948 has been using a mathematical equation comparing race results to the weight of the horse plus distance run to create a hierarchy which is used in many form guides for racegoers and owners			1
while performance on the turf is not always a leading indication of performance in retirement , top bloodstock experts say @entity1 's lifetime value in stud could be around $ 155 million			1
" @entity1 will have the pick of the best mares when it is time for him to stud , and there is no mare out there at the moment attracting as much attention as @entity2 , " says @entity55 , who has 25 years of experience in buying horses which have gone on to win major @entity58 meets around the world			1
" if you own a good mare and you can afford the stud fees @entity1 will command , why would n't you want to put forward your horse to breed with him ? " he told @entity0			1
and that initial stud fee is set to break the current world record held by @entity78 horse @entity79 , who earned nearly $ 7 million in prize money from a series of wins in major @entity58 races such as the @entity85 and the @entity86			1
" @entity79 commanded a $ 133,000 fee at the start , so it is not impossible that @entity1 's first valuation will be around $ 155,000 and that may be a touch on the conservative side , " @entity55 said			1
" there are no guarantees with this , and the performance of a horse on the course is not always a marker it can be successful in creating the next generation			0
but @entity1 's achievements in racing , coupled with his bloodline , means he would be more likely to sire a good racing performer			2
" bloodstock valuations have come down from the crazy prices of a decade ago , when horses would sell for $ 10 million as purchasers found it difficult to secure a return on their investment with falling prize money at racecourses around the world			1
but the high end of the market is still very lucrative , with yearlings from top breeds selling at $ 2 million			1
the statistics show exactly why a @entity121 horse would be much fancied on a racetrack			0
@entity1 commands a @entity36 rating of 147 , which is well above the average for a @entity58 race winner of 129			2
@entity2 is the highest rated filly of all time , rated at 136			1
" ever since he was a three - year - old , @entity1 has seemed determined to get better and better , " @entity36 's flat racing editor @entity128 told @entity0			2
" he had already rated at 140 by his first 2000 @entity130 last year , and by the @entity131 at @entity132 this year he had overtaken @entity133 as the greatest horse since records began			0
" it seems a shame that his owners do not want to test him at the longer distances , and i think what we are possibly seeing now is a winding down of his attendances with the chance he will be at stud by next year			0
it is unlikely we will see him at the @entity149 or the @entity85			0
" @entity2 , who turns six this month , may be retiring at roughly the same time			2
trainer @entity151 is still undecided whether she will get a few more run - outs as part of a farewell tour of @entity31 courses , or whether june 's @entity132 appearance was her last race			0
the cult status achieved by both horses has spawned a lucrative sideline business , with everything from @entity2 cufflinks priced at $ 42 to a $ 15 @entity1 coffee mug available through online stores			1
@entity167 's recent sellout crowd was largely down to the attendance of @entity1 and both have their own @entity171 pages			2
despite the desires of the racing industry to see these giants of flat racing procreate , there are two hurdles to overcome			0
@entity178 is whether @entity1 's owners want this to happen			0
there is a feeling in the industry at the moment that , come the day @entity184 decide to put him out to stud , they may want him to pair with mares already in their stable so they get to reap the rewards of whatever he will produce			0
however , that may be just for the first crop of the next generation , and they may be happy to let @entity1 go to stud elsewhere later on in his career			2
the second problem might be a little bit harder to overcome			0
the path of true love is not easy for humans , and it is no less an issue for horses			0
" at the end of the day there is no guarantee that @entity1 and @entity2 will take to each other			1
they might not like one another , much like some humans are unlikely to mate , " @entity55 said			0
" that is why , however much racehorse fans would like to see this happen , and however much money is offered to make it happen , the only two beings that can ensure it does are @entity2 and @entity1			1

@entity1 has won $ *1.8* million in prize money so far but he could be worth $ 155 million in stud
top yearlings used to fetch $ 10 million at *auction* but the market has *deflated* in recent years
@entity2 is the highest - rated filly of all time according to racehorse performance experts
both horses are mini marketing *enterprises* with a range of branded clothing and gifts
