-- frustrated that you ca n't share files the size of your entire music collection via e-mail ? @entity6 wants to help			0
@entity8 users can now send files of up to 10 gb using @entity10 , the web giant 's cloud - storage service			1
that 's 400 times bigger than files that can be shared in a regular e-mail , according to a blog post by @entity6 's @entity8 team			1
and because the files are stored in the cloud , all recipients will always have the latest version of the file -- in the case of a document that 's being amended over time , for example			1
how a fake @entity6 news story spread online " so whether it 's photos from your recent camping trip , video footage from your brother 's wedding , or a presentation to your boss , all your stuff is easy to find and easy to share with @entity36 and @entity8 , " the post reads			2
drive , and before that @entity38 , already allowed users to share large files			0
but the new feature is more streamlined , letting them do so without leaving @entity8			2
launched in april , @entity10 offers users 5 gb of free storage , with each additional 25 gb going for $ 2.49			1
the move is part of an ongoing effort by @entity6 to synchronize its various services , from @entity8 to social network @entity49 to the @entity51 mobile operating system			2
the ability to sync with @entity8 offers @entity6 a built - in edge over standalone cloud storage tools like @entity55			1
" should services like @entity55 be concerned ? sort of , " wrote @entity57 of @entity58			0
" as the move shows , @entity6 's core strength is in its ability to connect and integrate its various services -- even the unpopular ones -- into one cohesive product			0
this gives drive a clear edge over competing standalone cloud services , so expect @entity6 to leverage it as much as possible			0
" the file - sharing feature will be rolled out over the next few days , according to @entity6			0
users must have opted in to @entity8 's " @entity72 " tool in order to use it			1
@entity6 announced this year that @entity8 has more than 425 million active users .			0

new @entity8 tool allows sharing of files up to 10 gb
feature uses @entity10 , the company 's cloud storage
10 @entity81 is 400 times the data currently shareable with @entity8
