@entity0 -- in the latest @entity4 movie " @entity9 , " @entity2 's 007 pursues an assassin up a glass skyscraper in the dead of night and meets a glamorous casino host with a troubled past			1
the action could plausibly have taken place in any of the world 's major metropolises but the film makers chose @entity15 and @entity16 , two of @entity19 's most dynamic cities			1
it reflects the growing importance of @entity19 as a market for @entity24 movies and @entity19 backdrops , themes and actors are likely to become only more commonplace			1
but appealing to @entity19 audiences is fraught with difficulty as the makers of " @entity9 , " which has fallen foul of @entity19 censors , have discovered			1
censors cut a key scene and altered subtitled dialogue in the movie , which opened in @entity19 on monday			1

later in the movie , at a casino in @entity16 , 007 asks @entity54 ( @entity55 ) about her tattoo			2

such censorship is not uncommon for @entity24 films released in @entity19 , says @entity79 , founder of @entity81 , a @entity15 - based film and cinema consultancy , and every film released in @entity19 is subject to the censorship bureau 's approval			1

" movies featuring social unrest , religion , political matters , sex and violence are likely to face extra scrutiny , said @entity79			2
" part of this is rooted in the fact that @entity19 still does not have a movie rating system and so the burden of determining what is appropriate for the general public to see falls on the ( censor ) , " he said			0

" i think foreign movies have to use @entity19 elements carefully			0
there has to be a mix of positive and negative portrayal , " @entity114 told @entity1			0
it 's understandable ( why censors want to remove certain scenes ) if a movie contains only a few @entity19 scenes and the @entity19 characters either get killed or appear in negative roles like prostitutes			2

@entity19 relaxed its quota system for @entity144 films last year but still only allows 34 movies a year -- up from 20 previously			0
to circumvent the quota , many @entity144 studios are launching tie - ups with their @entity19 counterparts to get preferential access but these co-productions , as they are known , have mixed results			0
there is also widespread industry speculation that @entity19 rigs release dates to favor domestic movies			0
pow says that " @entity9 " and " @entity160 , " scheduled to be released later this year , may have fallen prey to this : " december is traditionally a month where @entity19 films enjoy a period where no imported ... titles are released in @entity19			2
" illegal downloading too takes its toll on the film industry			0
@entity19 audiences can easily access a copy of the original " @entity9 " should they wish to see the uncut version , but this does not necessarily hurt box office takings , said @entity79			1
" the publicity surrounding heavy censorship creates greater awareness so while illegal downloading will go up , ticket sales at cinemas will also go up , " he said			0
" it can spin both ways			0
