-- @entity2 authorities overreacted in shutting down the online file - sharing site @entity6 and seeking criminal charges against its executives , the company 's @entity2 lawyer said friday			1
" we believe that the allegations are without merit and @entity6 is going to vigorously defend against the case , " attorney @entity10 said			1
federal authorities shut the site down thursday , the same day they announced indictments against seven people connected to the site , accusing them of operating an " international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works			2
" four of those charged were arrested friday in @entity24 at the request of @entity2 authorities			1
the site , which traffic - tracking service @entity26 ranked as the world 's 72nd most visited website before it was taken down , allowed users to share and download files , many of which were copyrighted works made available for download without permission , according to authorities			1
@entity10 said the case demonstrates a " copyright extremist mentality " on the part of @entity2 authorities and raises significant due process and consumer protection issues			1
he said it was inappropriate for @entity2 authorities to seize the company 's servers and domain names , not to mention $ 50 million in assets , without a court hearing			1
he also said the seizure means consumers who had stored legitimately acquired materials on sites owned by @entity6 can no longer access them			2
the seizure " has essentially created a chilling effect on consumers using @entity56 cloud storage going forward , " @entity10 said			2
federal prosecutors allege @entity6 's founders " conducted their illegal operation using a business model expressly designed to promote uploading of the most popular copyrighted works			1
" the site 's popular @entity6 subsidiary was widely known in tech circles for its copious selection of pirated content , including recent movies and episodes of hit tv shows			1
" the conspirators allegedly paid users whom they specifically knew uploaded infringing content and publicized their links to users throughout the world , " prosecutors said in a statement			0
they also took steps to mask the presence of illegal content on the site , prosecutors said			0
the company also discouraged users from using the site for legitimate personal storage by automatically deleting files that were n't regularly downloaded , prosecutors said			2
authorities said the operation had generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships			2
those indicted are citizens of @entity24 , @entity98 , @entity99 and the @entity100			0
no @entity2 citizens were named			2
however , @entity6 has servers in @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity105 , which prompted the @entity104 - based investigation			1
the investigation involved 20 search warrants in eight countries , authorities said			2
officials seized 18 domain names from the company and its servers based in the @entity2 , the @entity100 and @entity114			1
@entity6 's sudden shutdown thursday got the attention of hackers , who quickly assembled a widespread operation to take down the @entity120 and @entity122 websites , as well as those for the @entity124 , the @entity125 and several other sites			1
the internet activism and hacking collective @entity129 took credit for the denial - of - service attacks , which do n't damage computer systems but keep sites from operating properly by overloading them with spurious requests			1
that can slow a site down or keep its servers from responding to legitimate requests			0
" it 's a violation of freedom of speech , " one @entity129 member told @entity0 of the @entity6 shutdown			1
" it 's part of a bigger picture that 's taking place ... which is a very big slide toward internet censorship on a gigantic scale			0
" most of the sites were back up by friday morning , but the website for @entity24 police , which @entity129 also targeted , appeared to be down early saturday			1
the @entity120 and @entity122 sites targeted thursday were operating normally on friday , a law enforcement official told @entity0			2
investigators are " looking at forensics to see where ( the attack ) came from , " the official said			0
no data breaches occurred on @entity2 government sites , the law enforcement official told @entity0			2
the four @entity6 officials arrested in @entity24 -- @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 -- appeared friday at an initial court hearing			1
@entity162 , the @entity6 founder and owner , spoke briefly , interrupting an attorney who sought to stop reporters from photographing the men , according to the @entity172 newspaper			1
" we do n't mind ... if people want to take photographs of us or cover this event because we 've got nothing to hide , " the newspaper quoted him as saying			0
it was unclear when extradition proceedings would begin			0
the four were arrested after a complicated raid that involved 76 police officers who arrived at a @entity24 mansion by helicopter and had to repeatedly defeat electronic locks in pursuing @entity162 , @entity24 's @entity186 reported , citing detective inspector @entity187			0
officers had to cut their way into a safe room , where they found @entity162 near a sawed - off shotgun , the broadcaster reported			0
" it was definitely not as simple as knocking at the front door , " @entity186 quoted @entity187 as saying			0
the raid , seizure and shutdown comes in the same week as a widespread @entity56 protest over controversial anti-piracy bills in the @entity199 and @entity200 that would make it easier for @entity2 authorities to target foreign piracy sites , of which prosecutors allege @entity6 was one			1
the bills are known as the @entity206 , or @entity206 , and the @entity207 , or @entity207			0
the bills are aimed at cracking down on copyright infringement by restricting access to sites that host or facilitate the trading of pirated content			0
but the legislation has created a divide between tech giants , who say the language is too broad , and large media companies , who say they are losing millions each year to rampant online piracy			0
@entity223 , the parent company of @entity0 , is among the industry supporters of the legislation			0
on friday , after numerous legislators pulled their support for the legislation in the wake of the protests , @entity227 and @entity200 leaders announced they would delay action on the legislation to address concerns raised by activists			0
@entity10 said the shutdown calls into question whether legislation like @entity206 or @entity207 is truly needed			1
" this demonstrates the government is certainly able to act without any additional legislation , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248 contributed to this report			0
