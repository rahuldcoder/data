the @entity89 racer mastered the mind games in @entity0			1

[ but ] i 'm still looking for one of those weekends where we do n't have any troubles			0
" significant victory ? if victory boosted @entity4 's reserves in the mental warfare between the @entity13 rival , then @entity9 's confidence may have been dented by his own mistakes			1
