-- february 25 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			2
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 announcer : two ...			2
one ... booster ignition ... and the final liftoff of @entity17			1
@entity18 , @entity19 : of course , we will have more on that for you in today 's show , but we are getting off the ground in northern @entity25			2
@entity0 starts right now ! first up : unrest in @entity4 @entity29 : there are roughly 6,000 americans in @entity4 , and the @entity33 government is trying to get them out			1
a ferry that was chartered to take hundreds of @entity33 citizens from @entity4 to @entity36 was held up for a while yesterday			2
@entity33 officials said everyone onboard was safe			2
they said the delay was because of the weather			2
meanwhile , @entity4 's leader , @entity41 , is blaming the violence in his country on young people			2
he says they 're taking some sort of pills and being manipulated by the @entity49 terrorist group			2
but during a speech earlier this week , president @entity50 said what 's going on in that part of the world has nothing to do with outside influences			1
@entity33 president @entity50 : so let me be clear			1
the change that is taking place across the region is being driven by the people of the region			2
this change does n't represent the work of the @entity33 or any foreign power			2
it represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life			1
political unrest @entity29 : looking around that region , starting next door to @entity4 in @entity73			1
the country has lifted a 19 - year - old state of emergency , and what that means is that people there have greater freedom of speech and assembly now			2
moving south to @entity81 , where protesters are demanding that the country 's president step down			1
he 's been in power for nearly 30 years and is running for re-election this year			2
finally , @entity88 , where eight lawmakers resigned to protest violence against people who are demonstrating against the government			2
one of the lawmakers said , " i resigned because there 's been no respect by the government for human rights			2
" is this legit ? @entity98 , @entity19 : is this legit ? the space shuttle discovery is named after sailing ships			1
this one 's true ! the shuttle is named after two ships that explored the world			1
final mission @entity29 : the space shuttle discovery has made more trips into space than any other craft			1
all together , the shuttle 's spent almost a full year in orbit around the @entity112			1
yesterday , @entity17 set out on its 39th and last mission , delivering equipment to the international space station			1
this was @entity17 's first launch , back in 1984			2
and these launches are n't cheap			0
@entity14 estimates that every time a shuttle takes off , it costs nearly half a billion dollars			1
after @entity17 's current mission , there are just two launches left for the space shuttle program			1
@entity124 @entity29 : we 've been reporting on this controversial budget bill in @entity5			0
you can check our transcript archives for details on that			0
now , it was scheduled to come up for a vote yesterday , but only in the @entity133			0
things are not moving forward in the @entity135			0
and that 's because @entity138 senators have left the state in an effort to try to block any vote on the bill			0
you can get the latest details on this situation at @entity146			0
teachers ' lounge @entity29 : our latest @entity150 blog asks for your opinions about a controversial budget decision in @entity155			0
the city 's planning to close half of its public schools			0
and teachers , we want to hear your thoughts on this			1
enter the @entity150 from our home page : @entity163 ! @entity164 @entity165 , @entity19 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity168 's world geography class at @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 ! @entity172 was the first @entity173 to play in what sports league ? was it the : a ) @entity178 , b ) @entity177 , c ) @entity180 or @entity181 ) @entity182 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity172 made his debut in the @entity182 in 1958			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! diversity in hockey @entity29 : @entity172 paved the way for other african - americans to hit the @entity182 ice			1
as we continue our commemoration of @entity195 , we 're taking a look at the diversity on the @entity199 ' roster			0
@entity200 sat down with the team 's four african - americans to talk about life as a minority pro hockey player			1
( begin video ) @entity206 , @entity207 : i want each one of you to tell me what you like about hockey			1
sell me on hockey ! sell me ! @entity212 , thrashers left winger : hockey is the fastest , most physical sport there is			1
@entity218 , @entity219 : the teamwork , too			0
i would say a total package sport			0
@entity222 , thrashers right winger : i just like skating fast , ever since i was three			0
@entity223 , @entity219 : i guess it 's just something about being on the ice that i enjoy			0
it 's just me being out there , having fun and enjoying the people around me			0
@entity231 : what 's the biggest misconception or false assumption that people make about you ? @entity223 : this guy ca n't stand on skates			0
@entity239 : maybe in @entity6 , you tell people that you 're a hockey player and they do n't believe you			1
@entity231 : what do you think ? @entity239 : i do n't know			0
maybe basketball or baseball , i have no idea			0
@entity231 : who here knew that they were going to be a professional hockey player ? anybody here know that ? @entity253 : i knew probably when i was in grade one			1
we had an assignment to say what you wanted to be when you grew up			0
and i said , " @entity262 player , " and she said , " pick something else			0
" and i said , " no , i 'm going to be a hockey player , " and i stuck with it			1
@entity231 : did anybody try to steer you to something different , because you do n't look out on the ice that often and see people of color ? did someone say this is n't the right fit for you ? @entity274 : no , i think , honestly , it was almost the opposite			0
my dad really instilled that drive in me to battle through that kind of stuff , battle through adversity , and that 's what made me so successful			0
@entity231 : anybody else feel that they were steered in a different direction for racial reasons at all ? @entity253 : i grew up sort of in an urban neighborhood and , you know , a lot of my friends are playing basketball and sports like that			0
i 'd go play a little bit of basketball , but after an hour i 'd get bored of it , so i 'd say , " i have to go play hockey now			1
" and they would go , " uh , naw , you 're not going to make it in hockey , so you might as well play basketball " or something like that			1
but i had some support from my parents			0
that helped me a lot			0
all my close friends to date were minor hockey players , and their support helped get me to where i am today			1
@entity231 : we always hear about hockey as , it 's an expensive sport for kids who want to play			1
and often , maybe , that 's why minority kids do n't get into it			0
explain , why is it so expensive ? @entity253 : i think when you have to pay $ 500 for a pair of skates as opposed to a $ 20 basketball or $ 50 pair of soccer shoes , it makes a lot more sense to play those sports			0
but there 's a lot of community initiatives right now in the @entity182 helping urban kids			0
and with the hockey is for everyone program that 's helping not so fortunate kids play , they 're making good strides			1
( @entity337 ) before we go @entity29 : finally today , with the space shuttle program winding down , we 're looking back at the 132 missions that have come before			1
and just for fun , we 're gon na do it in 132 seconds			0
[ video package of all 132 shuttle launches ] goodbye @entity29 : seeing all that video can leave you feeling spacy ! before we launch into the weekend , we thank our fans on @entity350 for all of your " likes " at @entity350 / @entity352			2
