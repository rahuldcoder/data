-- three years ago , the @entity1 struggled with a serious recruiting crisis , a crisis that evaporated temporarily only when the economy slumped			1
as it recovers and our population continues to age , the @entity1 will face yet another challenge in recruiting the high - quality people needed for the modern military			1
for that reason , the @entity11 identified the @entity13 as a smart way to expand the pool of eligible candidates for enlistment			2
the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) @entity13 is a bipartisan bill that would provide a path to legal residence for undocumented young people who were brought to the @entity24 as children			1
the conditions : they must graduate from high school , demonstrate good moral character , and -- to keep their legal status -- complete at least two years of higher education or at least two years service in the @entity24 military			1
without the relief of the @entity13 , the future of these @entity24 - educated young people is bleak			1
about 65,000 such eligible students graduate from @entity24 high schools each year , but upon graduation , these young people , who include honor roll students , star athletes and junior rotc members , hit a wall			1
instead of advancing to college or the military and later repaying the investment that taxpayers made in their education , they live in fear of being discovered by the @entity51 and deported to their " home " country , even if it is a country they can not remember and where they have no friends , family or support			2
two potential @entity13 students are @entity63 , a senior honors student at the @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67 , a third - year law student at the @entity68			1
@entity63 , who dreams of joining the @entity69 after graduation , is at the top of his class and has lived in the @entity24 since he was 9 years old			0
@entity67 has lived here since he was 5 and wants to be a military lawyer after graduation			0
@entity63 and @entity67 are exactly the kind of recruits the military needs : self - motivated and eager to defend the country they love			0
without the @entity13 , both will be deported			1
@entity82 , former acting deputy undersecretary of defense for military personnel , has called the @entity13 " very appealing " to the military because it applies to the " cream of the crop " of students			1
potential @entity13 beneficiaries like @entity63 and @entity67 are a military recruiter 's dream candidates for enlistment , even if they have no legal status			1
they are americanized , having lived in the @entity24 for at least five years , unlike the newly lawful permanent residents whom the military currently enlists			2
@entity13 beneficiaries have no adult period of residence in a foreign country , making it easier to perform background checks for security clearance			0
they often speak both @entity101 and another language fluently			0
many have participated in @entity104 in high school			0
they do not have criminal records or other evidence of bad character			0
they have graduated from a @entity24 high school			2
if approved as @entity13 beneficiaries , they will have passed rigorous criminal background and security checks from @entity51			0
they will have " conditional lawful residence , " which is recognized under current military recruiting regulations			0
thus , the military will not have to change its regulations or process their enlistments differently from other recruits			0
finally , they will be motivated to serve the @entity24 so as to be given a chance to stay here			2
opponents of the @entity13 call it a " sugar - coated " amnesty that rewards lawbreakers			2
to them , the best solution to the problem of illegal residents who are also high - achieving students with dreams of serving in the military is deportation , even though that would massively benefit their countries of birth while depriving the @entity24 of their talents			1
instead of wearing our uniforms , these recruits could be recruited to work for foreign governments , foreign militaries and foreign intelligence agencies			0
at a time when we are focused on protecting our borders and quashing threats to our national security , it seems unwise to export thousands of @entity24 - educated and @entity24 - acculturated young people to militaries other than our own			1
the @entity150 and @entity151 are poised to consider the @entity13 during the current lame duck session of @entity153			0
the vote presents an opportunity for our lawmakers to increase military recruitment , enhance @entity24 national security and help high - achieving young people at the same time			1
i strongly urge members of @entity153 to pass this long overdue measure			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			0

@entity165 : armed forces expect to face another recruiting crisis as economy recovers
@entity13 could help both undocumented young people and the military , she says
stock : those brought to @entity24 as kids could serve in @entity24 military in a path to *citizenship*
this allows high - achieving young people to enlist rather than be deported , she *writes*
