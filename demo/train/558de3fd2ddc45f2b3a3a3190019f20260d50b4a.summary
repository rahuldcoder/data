@entity0 -- the government will provide $ 680 million in compensation to settle a class - action lawsuit by @entity6 farmers against the @entity8 @entity7 , according to a proposed agreement announced tuesday			1
under the agreement , which requires federal court approval , @entity11 can file claims for discrimination involving farm loans that occurred in the period from 1981 - 1999 , said statements by agriculture secretary @entity17 and attorney general @entity18			1
" today 's settlement can never undo wrongs that @entity11 may have experienced in past decades , but combined with the actions we at @entity7 are taking to address such wrongs , the settlement will provide some measure of relief to those alleging discrimination , " @entity17 said in his statement			1
the $ 680 million will compensate eligible members of the class - action suits with valid claims , the statements said			1
the agreement has two payment tracks -- one provides $ 50,000 to those who provide substantial evidence of discrimination to an impartial adjudicator , and the other pays up to $ 250,000 to those who can show economic losses caused by discrimination			1
" actual monetary awards are subject to reduction based on the amount of available funding and the number of meritorious claims , " the statements said			0
the settlement also includes $ 80 million for debt relief , as well as other assistance for @entity6 farmers			1
in a @entity52 statement , president @entity50 called the agreement " an important step forward in remedying @entity7 's unfortunate civil rights history			1
" the lawsuit alleged discrimination against @entity11 regarding their access to and participation in the @entity7 's farm loan programs , according to the statement			1
" this settlement marks a major turning point in the important relationship between @entity11 , our nation 's first farmers and ranchers , and the @entity7 , " said a statement by @entity69 , the lead plaintiffs ' attorney			1
" after three decades , @entity6 farmers and ranchers will receive the justice they deserve , and the @entity7 has committed to improving the farm loan system in ways that will aid @entity11 for generations to come			2
" @entity77 and @entity78 , whose name is on the lawsuit against the government , said they were unfairly denied operating loans and had to sell portions of their sprawling farm on the @entity86 in @entity87			0
" this is a great day for us , not only for us but our people , " @entity78 said			0
" it 's been a long time brewing and finally today it came to a positive end			0
and i 'm happy about that			0
" she said she wants to use some of the money to pay off bills and to make much needed repairs to their home of 40 years			0
@entity102 of the @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 , who is a member of the lawsuit , said she was unfairly denied farms loans in the past			0
@entity102 and her husband still reside on land that was allocated by the @entity111 , which intended to settle native american tribes and turn them into farmers and ranchers			0
" it definitely was long , and it definitely was worth it , to voice some measure of justice for our community , " @entity102 said of the settlement			1
" it 's always a rare day and one we rejoice in			0
we are very happy to be put back on equal footing again with the rest of @entity8			2

it will create the native american farmer and @entity131 , a new federal advisory committee , which lawyers said will bring together @entity6 and @entity7 officials to discuss the @entity7 's programs			2
" i think the leadership in the @entity7 genuinely wants to see them succeed , " @entity69 said , adding that it will take time to implement the changes			2

" he praised the leadership of @entity78 and @entity103 and others , saying their perseverance showed such a case could succeed			0
" this illustrates the power of the individuals , " @entity69 said , adding they had " pursued this with great courage and determination , and it 's a great tribute to them and others like them who may want to take on a mission like this			0
" the agreement follows a similar settlement in february on behalf of @entity171 farmers against the @entity7 , known as @entity172 , that settlement depends on congressional appropriation of the necessary funds , which has n't happened			1
@entity50 's statement called on @entity176 to authorize the more than $ 1 billion in funding for the @entity179 settlement			2
payment to the @entity6 farmers will come from the @entity182 maintained by the @entity183			0
the fund was established to provide monetary awards for court judgments and settlements against the government , and therefore needs no separate congressional authorization for the @entity6 farmers settlement			1
according to the 2007 @entity192 , there are about 60,000 @entity6 farmers in the @entity8 -- double the number of @entity171 farmers .			0
