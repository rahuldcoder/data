-- world champion @entity1 continued his superb @entity3 by powering to victory in friday 's 152.5km 13th stage of the race from @entity7 to @entity8			1
@entity9 , who wore the leader 's yellow jersey for seven days earlier in the race , was one of 10 riders who broke clear of the peloton after 57km , as the overall leaders kept their powder dry ahead of saturday 's tough stage in the mountains			1
@entity20 @entity19 , who made a brave bid to win thursday 's stage before being caught on the final climb up to @entity24 , was also in the breakaway group , and he tried the same tactic again when he made another bold bid for success on the day 's big climb -- the @entity30			2
however , unlike thursday uphill finish , friday 's major climb came 42km from the end of the stage , with a long downhill descent before a flat finish into @entity8			0
and @entity1 used all his strength to catch the unfortunate @entity19 with just 2km remaining to win by 10 seconds , with @entity38 also catching and passing exhausted compatriot @entity19 , who was 26 seconds back in third place			2
the rest of the breakaway group finished in dribs and drabs ahead of the main pack , who came home over seven - and - a - half minutes behind , with all the leading contenders finishing together			0
there was no change in the overall classification , with @entity20 @entity51 remaining 1:49 ahead of @entity52 , with @entity53 2:06 down in third position			1
defending champion @entity55 , who lost a few seconds on the leaders on thursday , remains seventh -- exactly four minutes behind @entity51 -- while the only change in the top 10 saw @entity60 @entity59 , who led the race after the first stage , move up to ninth overall after attacking the peloton on the descent to the line to gain 50 seconds			1
the victory maintains @entity1 's remarkable @entity3 record			1
he has now won nine individual stages , including at least one victory in the last six tours , as well as taking the green points jersey in 2005 and 2009			0
he is also the first rider to win a stage of the @entity3 whilst wearing the famous rainbow bands of the world champion 's jersey , since @entity78 's @entity77 in 2002			1
" i find it hard to believe where that display came from , but i 'm happy			0
to win solo like that wearing the rainbow jersey is something else , " @entity1 told reporters			2
a disconsolate @entity19 , who did collect the climber 's polka dot jersey as a consolation after once again going close to claiming his first - ever stage victory , said : " it 's too hard to take			2
i think i will have a lot of trouble digesting this			0
" meanwhile , the stage saw three more riders abandon the race , with the highest profile being @entity98 's @entity97 , twice runner - up in the race , who quit following a successions of crashes throughout the last two weeks			0
saturday 's 168.5km 14th stage from @entity104 to @entity105 is likely to be a key day in the destination of this year 's race , with the field tackling six major climbs before the 15.8km ascent to the finish .			0

@entity1 is the first world champion to win a stage since @entity77 in 2002
