i became the president in 1988			2
it was a really great time			0
we 've been enjoying the so - called bubble economy			0
so whatever we do , it was very successful in like four to five years , however , after that collapse of the bubble economy , we had a really hard time			0
but we set up a quite precise schedule to the comeback			0
and everybody really worked hard -- very cooperative			0
so we came back @entity10 : what lessons do you think you learnt that made the company better from going through that very sharp downturn ? @entity9 : well we emphasize wherever we have strongness			1
during the good years , we diversified the range of the business			0
most of them i failed			0
so whatever left we really emphasized this area which is technology			0
@entity10 : you 've looked at the animal kingdom to provide some clues for developing new products			1
i 'm thinking of sharkskin used in your fast suits , patterns on a shark actually have been incorporated into your fast suits and there 's a lot of success with swimmers wearing your products in @entity66			1
what else are you working on ? @entity9 : well , we 're developing the new swimsuits for @entity70			2
this is quite different from the past			0

@entity10 : what do you think is the best piece of management advice you 've ever received ? @entity9 : i 've learned from the boy scout experience , our motto is be prepared			1
so every , you know the item , i have to do , i like to make good preparation , for the company for myself , or for family , we have to be prepared			2
