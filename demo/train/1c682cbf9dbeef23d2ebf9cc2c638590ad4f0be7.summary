-- as of monday , the best damn news team in @entity2 has a new member : @entity4 , an @entity5 veteran who happens to look a lot like the vast majority of " @entity8 's " new featured players ( read : blandly handsome ; white )			1
" @entity15 " — which , in the fairly recent past , has come under fire for a lack of onscreen and behind - the - scenes diversity — made a joke of this in @entity4 's very first segment monday night , naming him the program 's new senior caucasian correspondent			1
@entity21 sheds a tear in ' @entity15 ' farewell and naturally , the self - referential humor did n't stop there			0
the @entity15 get more : @entity26 , @entity15 on @entity27 theoretically , @entity4 's caucasian - ness made him the perfect choice for a piece focusing on the situation in @entity32			1
in practice , the poor guy was so nervous that he ended up turning the entire segment into a self - conscious commentary on his own situation as a new member of the " @entity15 " family — culminating in a fourth - wall busting act that might have gotten @entity4 the ax if , you know , it had n't been planned			2
@entity43 , @entity44 ( nearly ! ) come to blows on ' @entity15 ' @entity46 done , @entity47 ; we 're sure @entity49 is very proud of you this morning			0
