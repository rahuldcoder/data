the hunt to become the home of @entity4 's lasting @entity3 legacy has become a game of presidential library survivor			1
for now , the president 's native @entity7 can only hope , to borrow a phrase , that it is not voted off the island			1
" i would just note that the president chooses to spend his winters in @entity19 , not @entity20 , " said @entity7 's recently elected gov. @entity12 , who touted the islands ' appeal as the @entity16 's annual refuge during the holiday season			1
still , @entity12 acknowledged his state is an underdog in its competition with the three other remaining proposed bids to win the multimillion dollar project : two in @entity20 and one in @entity27			1
" @entity7 has been the underdog before			1
we trust the president and the foundation will make the best decision , " @entity12 added during an interview at his office in the state capitol			0
in between rounds of golf , the president conceivably has had time to decide where to place his library			2
but @entity3 officials declined to comment on whether any meetings on the topic have occurred over his winter vacation in @entity7			1
in many respects , @entity7 's proposed @entity19 site is a strong contender			1
the eight - acre parcel of land is on the city 's spectacular waterfront , looking out on @entity52 and @entity55 's iconic @entity54 peak			2
another perk , @entity12 noted , is that this slice of paradise is already owned by the state			0
there are , however , some potential drawbacks to @entity19			0
set apart from the @entity63 mainland , @entity7 is hardly a convenient place to preserve presidential documents			1
presidential libraries are intended for researchers and historians , not foreign tourists and families on vacation , a source close to @entity7 's bid conceded			1
another potential obstacle is that a sizable portion of the site has been transformed into a tent village by dozens of @entity19 's homeless , including women and children who would be forced to move to another part of the city			1
a homeless woman who called herself " @entity84 " said the tent village is buzzing with rumors the city will push out the area 's inhabitants to make way for development			2
" now we know why we got to leave			0
i have no problem that they want to make a library			2
but where is the rest of everyone going ? " she asked			0
@entity84 suggested @entity4 pay the area a visit			2
" he should come back and take a look			0
it 's like they 're trying to hide us back here , trying to shove us back here , " she added			2
there is a sense of resignation in the tent village that the waterfront area may well be selected as the home of the @entity114			0
" i guess he can do whatever he wants to do			0
i might offend people , " said another woman , who asked to be identified only as @entity118 , as she served hot meals to homeless people out of the back of her car			0
@entity19 city officials explain the homeless tent village on the city 's proposed library site will have to be moved either way , as developers have plans for new construction , with or without a presidential museum			1
despite those issues , @entity19 's prospects did receive a possible boost this week from the city once considered the front - runner to host the presidential library , @entity4 's adopted hometown of @entity20			1
the @entity140 , which has been tasked to lead the library search , has raised " major " concerns about the two proposals coming from @entity20 , according to sources familiar with the selection process			1
foundation officials are alarmed that the sites included in a pitch from the @entity149 are controlled by city @entity151 officials			2
the foundation would rather have the university in charge of the land in order to ease construction			0
concerns with a separate proposal from the @entity161 stem from upcoming leadership changes there			2
the city of @entity20 is urgently working to remedy the problems with the @entity149 proposal by clarifying how the land can be used , said an aide to mayor @entity169 , @entity4 's former @entity3 chief of staff			1
but city officials concede there is little they can do about the @entity161 ' issues			0
in an indication of how fierce the library competition has become , @entity7 's governor grinned upon hearing about @entity20 's problems , describing them as " terrific " for his own state 's prospects			1
the other remaining contender for the library , @entity182 in @entity27 , may be benefiting from the issues plaguing the @entity19 and @entity20 bids			1
one sticking point in selecting @entity188 's upper - @entity187 neighborhood : it already boasts one ex-president , @entity190 , who keeps an office there			0
for now , the @entity140 is taking a restrained approach in commenting on the looming decision that the president and first lady are expected to make in early 2015			0
" the foundation is evaluating all four respondents across a variety of criteria			0
each institution is unique and has different strengths and weaknesses relative to the others , " the foundation said			0
with the president and first family still in @entity55 , @entity19 mayor @entity206 is hoping to give the @entity209 his best pitch before they return to @entity211			0
he plans to see the @entity209 off on the tarmac at @entity213 when they fly out this weekend , though will only raise the library if the feeling is right			0
" any time i get with the president , i will try my best to make a plug for our site , " he said			0
" but i want to send him off with aloha			0
" acknowledging @entity7 's long odds to win the selection process , @entity12 and @entity206 are both suggesting an alternative proposal of splitting @entity4 's post-presidential home , with the official library in either @entity20 or @entity27 and a separate presidential center in @entity19			1
@entity206 said he has joked with @entity169 , @entity20 's outspoken mayor , about the library competition			1
" i 've joked around a little bit with @entity169 , and there 's a chance we share parts of it , " @entity206 said			0
" but i do believe for people to truly understand the president they have to understand this place , " he added			0
while @entity7 is certainly remote , @entity12 noted the islands already act as a cultural bridge between the @entity63 and @entity242			2
add to that the state 's large @entity244 - @entity63 population , and a @entity7 presidential library would neatly reflect @entity4 's goal of pivoting @entity63 foreign policy to @entity242 , @entity12 argued			1
" we believe the presidential center would allow the president to really showcase what he believes as we move forward , " @entity12 said			1
" the multicultural fabric of @entity7 is such a profound statement of his desires , " he added			2

officials are hoping to win at least one part of @entity4 's presidential center
