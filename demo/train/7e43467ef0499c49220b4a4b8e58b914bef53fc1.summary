-- it is another landmark in the career of one of football 's greatest ever players			0
another two goals in the colors of @entity8 took @entity9 to 71 in the @entity10 -- level with the all - time record holder @entity13			1
the @entity15 striker grabbed both goals as the @entity18 giants beat @entity19 2 - 0 in @entity20 , and now needs just one more to go clear of the legendary @entity22 striker			1
@entity9 is already @entity8 's all - time leading scorer and a four - time @entity24 winner at the age of 27			1
not only did he move level with @entity13 in the @entity10 scoring charts , he also edged one ahead of another stand out player of this generation -- @entity32			1
the @entity34 striker failed to add to his tally in his side 's 1 - 0 victory over @entity38 on tuesday night , but the battle to beat @entity13 's record is still very much on			1
@entity9 's first came from that rare source -- his head			2
his fine finish from @entity45 's cross was only the fourth header in that bumper haul of 71 goals			1
and with 15 minutes left , @entity9 slid in to polish off a @entity50 cross from the left to pull himself level with @entity13			1
his brace also secured @entity8 's spot in the last 16 of the competition			2
@entity56 implosion elsewhere , it was another miserable @entity59 night for @entity60 champions @entity56			2
despite its riches and its legion of international stars , @entity62 's men sank to rock bottom in its group after a 2 - 1 home defeat to @entity70 , who had never before won in @entity72			1
only once has @entity56 made it out of the group stages -- last season -- when it was beaten 4 - 1 by @entity18 giants @entity8 in its last 16 clash			1
despite @entity56 's victory over neighbors united in the @entity80 derby on sunday , it has been in poor form of late , failing to win any of its three matches before that			1
and in a subdued atmosphere , it fell behind inside 96 seconds to a striker fast becoming its nemesis -- @entity88			0
the @entity89 rose highest to meet an early free kick and plant it beyond @entity72 goalkeeper @entity91 to score his fourth goal against @entity56			2
@entity88 's fellow countryman @entity93 brought the home side level with a stunning free kick of his own , firing into the top corner from 25 yards out			2
but @entity56 self destructed again , a poor clearance from @entity99 allowing @entity100 to pick @entity88 , who fired into the net past @entity91			2
@entity56 's task became more difficult when @entity104 midfielder @entity103 was sent off with 20 minutes remaining and things went from bad to worse ten minutes later when @entity93 was also dismissed			2
@entity70 saw out the remaining minutes to leapfrog @entity56 in the table and keep its own qualification hopes alive			1
" it 's very difficult to understand why we played so badly , " @entity62 told @entity108			0
it 's difficult to know why you have such a low performance from important players			0
it 's a strange moment			0
" i do n't think it 's just this competition -- in the last two weeks we are not playing the way we normally do			0
i do n't understand but we must find a reason			0
it 's a crisis of confidence			0
" in the group 's other clash , @entity123 followed up its 7 - 1 win over @entity127 in @entity128 with a 2 - 0 success at home , @entity131 and @entity132 grabbing the goals			1
another @entity135 club -- @entity60 leaders @entity137 -- struggled against @entity138 , drawing 1 - 1 with the @entity140 minnows			0
after squandering a string of first - half chances , @entity142 's side were made to pay when @entity145 curled a fine effort into the top corner beyond @entity148 on 50 minutes			0
@entity149 missed a glorious chance to double @entity138 's lead , firing over the bar from barely six yards out with the goal gaping , before @entity154 equalized with 17 minutes to go			0
@entity156 international @entity155 had a late penalty saved by @entity158 , but @entity137 extended its lead at the top of the group after @entity163 club @entity162 were beaten 4 - 2 by @entity164 in @entity165			2
" i was not happy with the team or the performance , " @entity142 told @entity108			0
" i think we deserved to win but with this referee i have a long story from my @entity128 times but i do n't want to go in this direction			0
" they gave absolutely everything -- they fought fantastically well for their point			0
it is a big day for them so it is also fair to praise them			0
" elsewhere , @entity181 beat @entity182 1 - 0 thanks to @entity185 's goal after 54 seconds -- the quickest in this year 's competition so far			1
@entity18 side @entity187 slumped to a 2 - 0 defeat by @entity190 outfit @entity189 , while @entity192 club @entity191 beat @entity193 5 - 0 , two weeks after winning 7 - 0 in @entity194 .			1

@entity9 pulls level with @entity13 's record haul of 71 @entity10 goals
@entity8 striker scores two goals in the @entity18 club 's 2 - 0 victory over @entity19
@entity205 needs one more to break @entity13 's mark while @entity32 is on 70
@entity56 sink bottom of the group after home defeat by @entity70
