-- five years ago , telling a friend that you interact regularly with a verbose orange traffic cone might earn you a pitying hug and a quick trip to the sanatorium			1
but these days , your friend might respond that they trade barbs with @entity11 's sweater vest			2
welcome to the age of novelty @entity14 accounts , where animals , inanimate objects and other nonhuman entities speak their mind regularly : a pigeon with a foul mouth and a fouler demeanor			1
on the social - media platform , users can express themselves creatively and get laughs by giving voice to those things that ca n't speak for themselves			2
novelty nonhuman accounts have been a @entity14 staple since @entity33 , a @entity35 - area housecat , joined the service in march 2007 on his way to 1.4 million followers			1
but they 've been in the news again recently after one user created @ olympicseat , a tongue - in - cheek response to the curiously vacant seats at @entity47 venues in @entity48			1
in the span of a few days , it has amassed more than 21,000 followers			1
another @entity53 - related feed celebrates the star - spangled towel that @entity57 gymnast @entity56 drapes over himself between events			1
it has more than 12,000 followers -- not bad , considering the average @entity14 user has 126			1
most of the people in this group of noteworthy @entity65 say their primary motivation for tweeting is to have fun			2
for others , it 's a chance to make their mark in the crowded world of the @entity73			2
however , all agree that more thought goes into their 140 - character musings than meets the eye			2
@entity78 when the woman behind pet - centric account @ @entity80 began her novelty @entity14 account in august 2010 , she was n't planning on sticking around			1
" i figured the best way to test the waters was with a pseudonym , " said the @entity85 , @entity86 , resident who asked that her name not be published to preserve the anonymity of her @entity14 persona			1
" i would n't offend friends and colleagues if i did n't follow them , and i could make a polite exit from @entity14 when i was done poking around			1
" two years and almost 19,000 followers later , she is still at it			1
in the beginning , though , she and many other novelty account successes admit they did n't really know what " it " was			1
" at first , i did n't know this account was about a cat , [ but ] as i explored the @entity105 , i soon realized i had a character that people related to , " she said			2
real or not , @entity78 is definitely a character			2
the cat ( its gender is ambiguous ) writes odes to the couch , gives its owner commands with @entity116 - like acerbity and complains about the family dog -- lovingly called " @entity118			2
" the @entity119 other anonymous @entity14 celebs began their accounts to educate and bring ( hilarious ) awareness to unappreciated things that ca n't speak for themselves , like the @entity23 fog that brings a chill to summers in that city			1
" i love everything about the fog , " said the man who created @ @entity130 in august 2010			1
" i think the way it sneaks over the hills is beautiful , mysterious and even a little romantic			2
i love how it stops at certain points above the city , creating a wall of clouds			2
and having moved here from a city where it was 100 - plus degrees in the summer , i was mostly excited to not be dripping in sweat for three consecutive months			2
" the man , who also requested anonymity , was inspired by @ @entity148 , a popular parody response to the @entity151 oil spill in the @entity152			1
through the lens of " @entity154 , " he reports on the public 's feelings toward the fog and acts like a pr rep for the maligned form of weather -- with a witty bent			2
@entity154 already has more than 5,000 followers			1
giving " @entity154 " an identity has brought out emphatic and sometimes cursory responses -- especially when the fog blocked @entity168 fireworks -- but the @entity105 has been receptive overall , he said			0
" [ i get ] lots of weather puns and haikus			0
my favorite tweets are when people take pictures of @entity154 and post them on @entity14 or @entity176 , " the man said			1
" seeing so many people pick up on it and tag @entity154 in their pictures has been overwhelmingly cool			0
" the @entity180 like @entity181 , @ @entity182 loves it when followers interact with him online			1
the @entity180 was originally a @entity186 account but came to @entity14 after its creator discovered the witty tweets of @entity190 's @entity189 , last year 's famously escaped snake , and motorsports satirist @ nascarcasm			1
today the @entity180 keeps a following of more than 20,000 users up to date on @entity197 happenings			0
and his followers respond in droves			1
" people notice cones in their everyday life and send pictures to me by the hundreds , " said the man behind the @entity202 , who asked that his name not be used			1
" i find that hilarious -- people stopping what they are doing in the real world to take a picture of an orange cone			0
" he added , " whenever the cone is hit during the course of a @entity197 race , my feed blows up			0
" when driver @entity220 hit the cone during a february practice in @entity223 , the @entity105 came to @entity180 's aid			0
" @entity220 made a @entity14 apology and i added about 1,200 followers in the next hour , " he said			1
" staying in character for some , the prospect of interacting " for real " with followers is off the table			1
" i am a bit like @entity233			0
nobody knows who i am , " said the man behind the foul - tempered @ @entity236 bird character , referring to the anonymous @entity238 - based artist			1
" if possible , i 'd like to keep it this way ? " he wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
apart from that statement , @entity244 never broke character			0
instead , he offered clues to his personality			0
i do not like @entity250 , " he wrote			0
the person behind the wildly popular @ @entity252 , which chronicles the " exploits " of a real - life snake that briefly escaped its enclosure at the @entity257 zoo , also declined to break character in an e-mail exchange with @entity0			1
the account has more than 200,000 followers			2
the strangest thing tweeted at the snake , its creator said , was a request for an endorsement from a high school student running for student government			0
" i endorsed him , " she wrote @entity0			0
snake bigotry at its best			0
" online alter egos many novelty twitterers with large followings are baffled by their popularity , which has led them to think about the relationship between the @entity278 and the real world			2
" i have a feeling , and i could be wrong , that the people that follow the @entity180 find it to be more ' real ' than some of the drivers out on the track , " its creator said			0
" they can reach out and in most cases get a response			0
and the fact that no one knows who it is -- which means it could be anyone -- just adds to the mystery and the enjoyment			0
" added the man behind @entity130 , " i think people in the @entity301 like @entity154 because the fog was already a character in their lives			0
in a world that 's becoming increasingly personalized , you can surround yourself with a cast of friends on the internet that match your exact interests and sense of humor			0
" being @entity154 has challenged him to think about sports , pop culture , and politics in ridiculous ways , he said			0
" it forces me to be disciplined by sticking to a theme			0
since my job is n't creative by nature , it gives me the chance to be as witty as i want			0
" other @entity14 users say that embodying nonhuman entities gives them the chance to create alter egos			1
" the @entity202 gets to say and do the things i think we all wish we could do , " its creator said			0
the man behind @ @entity332 , a decidedly oddball stream of musings about , well , horse life , thinks he knows why his 137,000 followers appreciate his quirky humor			1
" it 's a breath of fresh air because it 's not malicious , " he said			0
" it 's not forced out by a brand with an agenda or political motive and it 's whimsical , throw - away and easy to digest			0
people respond well to that sort of thing			0
but let 's be honest : @ @entity351 may have one little agenda			2
" the recent demand for @entity356 t - shirts and mugs from my site ... has been another perk , " he said			0
