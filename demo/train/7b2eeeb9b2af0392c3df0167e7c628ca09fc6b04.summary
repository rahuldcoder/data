-- the @entity1 is a @entity3 power			1
not only do millions of @entity1 live in states that border or are firmly rooted in the @entity3 , more than 300,000 military service members and civilians who support them are stationed throughout the @entity3			2
countless @entity1 businesses and farmers also rely on access to this expanding market that has become an engine of global economic growth			1
in addition to reflecting our values , our foreign policy must reflect the fact that our prosperity and security is intimately linked with that of the @entity21			0
having just returned from this critical region , we heard directly from senior @entity1 military commanders , along with key leaders in @entity25 and @entity26 , about the desire for bolstering alliances that have been the cornerstone of stability in @entity31			1
we also met senior @entity33 officials in @entity34 and @entity1 business leaders in @entity36 about potential opportunities and challenges accompanying @entity33 's dramatic rise			1
@entity31 's continued economic growth is not certain , and the region is threatened by a despotic and volatile @entity43 regime armed with nuclear weapons			1
many nations are concerned that @entity33 will use its growing economic and military power to coerce its neighbors			1
our allies and adversaries alike have seen how @entity1 failed to enforce its " red line " in @entity50 , and they are questioning whether we have the resolve to respond decisively to challenges in @entity31			2
our partners are watching @entity1 's response to @entity57 's invasion of @entity58			0
they fear allowing an assault on @entity58 's territorial integrity to stand will invite challenges to the established international order and fuel already tense maritime territorial disputes that threaten stability in @entity31			2
for decades , @entity1 has deterred threats to peace in @entity31 , and these partners worry @entity1 lacks the commitment and capabilities to back threats with action			1
@entity1 can not lead in the region if it is thousands of miles away			0
the indispensable symbol of @entity1 strength and leadership is the @entity1 carrier fleet			1
protecting key international shipping lanes -- vital to our own economic stability -- has long been a central mission of the @entity82			0
but it is a mission that requires the forward basing of significant @entity1 naval resources , most importantly aircraft carriers such as the @entity88 @entity87			0
we were honored to board the @entity87 at its forward port facility in @entity25 and visit its crew			0
this aircraft carrier is due for a midlife overhaul , but the administration 's proposed budget does n't include funding for this much - needed service , putting the future of it and the 11 - carrier fleet in jeopardy			1
our military commanders were clear about the need for the unique power projection capabilities provided by our aircraft carrier fleet			1
these commanders know our allies and adversaries alike are watching to see if @entity1 allows its military superiority to wither , and struggle every day to reassure their counterparts throughout the region			2
@entity1 can not keep the peace alone -- nor have we			0
our allies have welcomed @entity1 military forces on their soil for decades , allowing the @entity1 to project military power far from our shores and enhancing our security here at home			1
we are encouraged by the desire of these allies to contribute more to regional security , but much work is needed to help them bolster their defenses , encourage greater coordination among them and reassure our allies and adversaries of our enduring commitment to @entity31			0
the sheer economic dynamism of @entity31 is impressive , and more than half of the world 's population lives there			2
it is important for @entity1 's economy that billions of @entity31 consumers are able to purchase our goods , services and agricultural products more easily			1
this is why we support the @entity141 , which is needed not only to facilitate greater trade across the @entity3 but also to establish the economic rules of the road firmly for the 21st century			0
a trade agreement based on mutually beneficial terms will promote real economic growth and real jobs here at home			2
we saw in @entity33 the stunning scope of economic growth that has lifted millions out of poverty and bolstered our own economic fortunes			1
but we were also struck by the absence of political and religious freedom in @entity33			0
while in @entity36 , we learned of the plight of a catholic bishop under house arrest for refusing to be subservient to the @entity159			0
and we visited a synagogue that by government edict is only open on @entity162 , just a few times a year			0
we believe that with economic freedom there should also be political freedom , and we call upon the @entity33 government to respect the universal human rights of its own citizens			0
@entity1 has a bright future in @entity31 , but only if we seize it			2
our trip coincided with president @entity173 's visit to the region			0
both @entity175 and @entity176 delivered similar messages about the importance of our alliances in @entity31 and our commitment to the region			1
now we must back our words with actions			0
unless the @entity1 reinvests in its military , strengthens its alliances and displays strong leadership , we will see increased threats , greater risk of instability and economic turbulence in a region of pivotal importance to @entity1 's future			1
join us on @entity195 / @entity194 .			0

a @entity175 delegation , fresh back from @entity31 trip , looks at @entity1 standing in region
@entity31 's continued economic growth is not certain , these *lawmakers* say
they fear that @entity33 will use its economic and military power to coerce neighbors
they argue @entity1 carrier fleet overdue for upgrades that administration has n't budgeted
