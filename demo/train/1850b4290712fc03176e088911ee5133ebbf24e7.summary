-- conflict and hardship have long made @entity4 a difficult place to live in , but one woman has set out to change that -- and she 's using soft croissants and fresh coffee			1
when @entity9 opened the " @entity11 " bakery in may , she brought something new to the residents of the town in the @entity15 of the @entity16			1
six months on , she is showing no signs of shutting up shop			0
" @entity4 is my home , " says @entity9 , 27			1
" i am very proud of @entity4			1
it 's the most beautiful part of @entity16 , and people here need fresh bread just like people in @entity24			1
" nestled between a mountainous national park and a freshwater lake , @entity4 sounds like the ideal setting for a holiday and the perfect place for a bakery			1
but the determined entrepreneur has had to overcome electricity , supply and staffing problems to make her dream a reality			1
@entity4 's troubles born in @entity4 , @entity9 was sent by her parents to study in @entity38 at the age of 12			1
" i had been to @entity38 once before with my family , but that time it was just me and my two sisters , " she recalls			0
" leaving my parents behind was tough			0
" @entity9 was n't to return home for 11 years			1
during her absence , @entity4 felt the horrific effects of the 1994 genocide in neighboring @entity49 as refugees fled across the nearby border			1
by the end of the 1990s an armed rebel movement called @entity53 were running the town , and @entity56 says the group forcibly recruited child soldiers to wage war in the politically unstable region where @entity61 , @entity49 and the @entity16 meet			1
as the armed conflict rumbled on in january 2002 , molten lava spewed out of the nearby @entity64 and quickly spread to the town			0
approximately 400,000 people were forced to flee and a third of the city was destroyed by the flames			2
@entity4 's residents began to rebuild the town after the natural disaster , but the @entity72 rebel group briefly occupied it in 2012 and waged war with @entity16 armed forces			1
@entity56 documented summary executions as well as numerous cases of violent sexual abuse			0
business beginnings returning to @entity4 at 23 , @entity9 saw a very different place to the town she had left			1
high quality food products were in short supply , as were clean water and electricity			1
the challenges did n't stop her from focusing on her goal of establishing the first high - end bakery in town			2
" two years before i opened the doors i started raising money , " she explains			0
" i needed to get an oven and mixing machine from @entity92			0
" another essential ingredient she could n't find locally was a skilled baker , so she convinced a baker from the @entity97 town of @entity98 to move to @entity4			2
" young people in @entity4 are n't well trained or educated , " she says			1
" i want to help young people learn new skills so the baker is training a @entity16 baker and a woman who makes cakes			1
" @entity106 continues : " @entity108 people are very nice and always smiling			2
their current difficulties are n't as bad as they were during the war , so people are very happy			1
they really want to learn new skills and are very happy to learn from the @entity97 baker			2
" while she ca n't run her business without materials from abroad , like brown flour and chocolate , @entity106 uses local products where she can			2
" i can find white flour in @entity4 , " she explains			2
" and the butter i use comes from my family 's farm about an hour away			0
the butter is n't sold in shops , but they produce enough for the bakery			2
" @entity128 croissants like the materials she uses , the customers @entity106 serves are a mixture of local and foreign			0
having experienced such hardship , @entity4 has become a center for ngos and charities in the region			1
the continued presence of expats has impacted the local economy and caused some price hikes for certain services like hotels and drivers			0
" in the beginning , most of the customers were expats , " @entity9 recognizes			2
" but more @entity16 people are coming these days -- they like the fresh bread and the birthday cakes as well			1
" for an expat aid worker living in @entity4 , " @entity11 " is a " godsend			1
" she says : " it 's literally the only place in town to get good croissants , tasty sandwiches and genuinely good bread ... the only thing they need to improve is the slow service -- if they find a way to make it speedy and efficient , the place will be pretty much perfect			2
" but not all the issues the aid - workers have come to help resolve are fixed			0
" it 's hard to set up something that 's got good foundations , " @entity9 says			2
there 's lots of tax which makes things expensive			0
the electricity always cuts out , so i had to buy a big generator which was expensive and [ it ] also uses fuel which is very expensive			0
@entity183 is also a problem			0
" and if these issues were n't enough , as well as a full - time business owner , @entity106 is a full - time mum of two			0
" i was pregnant when i was setting up the bakery , " she says			0
" i now have a three month year old daughter , and i have to care for her too			0
" despite her heavy workload , @entity106 is resolute that she 's doing the right thing			0
" we can never be sure the war wo n't start again , " she says			0
" we do n't know , but we must continue			0
we must do the schools , the hospitals , the restaurants			0
we have to keep a positive mindset and make sure @entity16 people do n't go to @entity24			1
local people need to stay here and create a better @entity16			1
