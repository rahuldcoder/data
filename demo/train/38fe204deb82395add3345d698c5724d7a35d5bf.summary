-- somewhere in a @entity5 warehouse , thousands of doses of antiviral medications are about to expire			1
another warehouse stores thousands of expired respirators			0
this is the equipment and medicine that was supposed to help protect government personnel in the event of a deadly pandemic			2
a federal investigation has found that the @entity5 is totally " ill - prepared " for something like the 2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic -- or something worse , such as a global @entity21 outbreak or the 1918 flu pandemic that killed an estimated 21.5 million people , according to a report released by the @entity16 on monday			1
in 2006 , @entity24 gave @entity5 $ 47 million to prepare for such a national medical crisis			1
and the department did go shopping ; it spent millions on this equipment that might now be completely worthless , missing or unnecessary			2
for example , the audit found more than 4,000 bottles of expired hand sanitizer in storage with the @entity5			1
many of those bottles have been expired for up to four years			0
some 81 % of the antiviral drugs the @entity5 has will expire by the end of next year			1
and 100 % of the @entity38 is set to expire in 2015			2
some 46 % of the @entity5 has will expire then as well			1
it was unclear to investigators whether the antiviral medication had been stored at a proper temperature			0
the department 's entire respirator stockpile has reached , or will soon reach , the manufacturer 's date of usability			2
and the report suggests the department failed to determine real - life needs before buying the equipment in the first place			0
the @entity54 pandemic stockpile has about 350,000 white coverall suits , according to the report			0
investigators say there is " no justification or related documentation " available to support that number of suits , nor does any kind of documentation explain why they were necessary			0
the same is true for surgical masks			0
there are 16 million in the department 's inventory ; no reason was given for having that many			0
overall , @entity5 failed to keep good records about what it purchased and what it received , according to the report			1
that may be why the government had to report a secondary stockpile containing 25,000 surgical masks and hand sanitizer as " lost			0
" the report concluded " it is imperative that @entity5 be prepared to continue mission - essential operations should a pandemic occur , " and yet it found that @entity5 did n't develop a clear plan on how to replenish their stockpiles of equipment			1
nor did they have a good way to keep a good control over their inventory to monitor expiration dates on material			1
" @entity5 is responsible for ensuring it is adequately prepared to continue critical operations in the event of a pandemic , " inspector general @entity92 said in a news release			1
@entity5 agreed with all 11 suggestions the inspector general 's @entity16 made to improve the program			1
the department will assign an office to oversee the supplies and develop an adequate strategy for making sure the material stays current			0
it has applied for a shelf life extension with the @entity106 to extend the expiration dates on the antiviral medicine it has that will expire in 2015			2
" we will work with them to see that this vital program is strengthened , " @entity92 said			0
virus hitting @entity114 could be ' tip of iceberg '			0

federal investigation finds the @entity5 stockpile of medicine is about to expire
some of the stockpiled *safety* material is also missing
@entity5 and the inspector general will work together to improve inventory *measures*
