-- millions of hectares of land have been acquired in the past few years across @entity3 by investors who are moving into large - scale agriculture to take advantage of potential windfall gains			1
popularly these deals have become known as " land grabbing , " but they could just as well have been framed as " water grabs			1
" the current global rush for agricultural land grew partly in response to increased global food prices since 2007			0
global capital is finding its way to agricultural investments on the basis of expectations of high returns , either through increased production or through speculation on further rising land prices			0
optimistic promises that such investment would also reinvigorate depressed rural economies , by virtue of employment creation and improved livelihoods , have proven to be vastly overstated , if not unfounded in many cases			0
but one of the untold stories of the global land grab is the quest to capture one of the most vital resources : water			2
as land is grabbed and earmarked for development , this often has implications for the water nearby , for local people 's land and water rights and environmental sustainability			1
@entity48 powerful actors ( transnational as well as national ) are pointing out that the lands in which they invest are " marginal " and " unproductive " lands			0
this has been shown to be untrue for many cases ; either the land is already used by small - scale food producers , or is of prime quality and associated with good ( potential ) access to water			1
read this : the myth of @entity3 's land grab in the @entity63 for example , the @entity61 government marked the @entity65 river basin for development , designating the floodplain area as " unused " and the adjacent terraces as " empty dryland " with irrigation potential			1
but this region has long been home to small peasant farmers , fishers and pastoralists from different ethnic groups , whose cooperative sharing of fragile land and water resources over the years has been possible because of delicately balanced customary use rights agreements amongst themselves			2
the violence last year in the @entity61 's @entity82 demonstrates the perils -- and tragedy -- of ignoring more complex social realities that exist on the ground			0
in most countries where land deals are taking place it is no use having land without also having access to water			1
research published in a special issue of @entity97 has shown water to be one of the prime drivers of the global rush to acquire land			2
despite this , many land deal contracts -- or the prior environmental assessments upon which they ought to be based -- do not explicitly mention water requirements , let alone quantify them			2
the issue of water grabs is a particularly slippery one			1
unlike land , water flows and moves from one place to another ; its availability goes up and down , affected by the seasons , human use , or climate change ; it can be visible on the surface and invisible underground			2
it can be a source of food , or disease and pollution			0
rights , access and uses are complex and varied			0
who has the right to the water in a river -- the people who live beside it in a given place , the farmers who depend on it for irrigation , or those upstream or downstream ? read this : one woman 's mission to fix water crisis water 's elusive nature makes it a prime target			1
the boundaries between legality and illegality are often fuzzy , and questions of jurisdiction over water can be unclear			0
grabbers often take advantage of this legal complexity			0
in @entity164 , according to research by the @entity160 , the separation of land and water rights created the space for water grabbing : pre-existing customary water rights were abolished and instead ownership , management and control of water were placed under authority of the state			1
similarly , water - quality impacts reach far beyond the place of pollution			2
a case in point is a large - scale land deal in the @entity180 of @entity181 under a lease - agreement with the government			1
according to a paper published by @entity190 @entity189 , fertilizers , pesticides and faeces of cattle led to the contamination of downstream drinking water sources serving a population of some 45,000 people			0
proponents of large - scale land deals deploy powerful narratives of underutilized land and water resources that " require " investment to " unlock " their potential , or an abundance of water and land , ready to be woken up by commercial agriculture			1
but it is at least debatable if the targeted land and water resources are indeed unused or even underutilized			0
the narratives of " unexploited resources " provide justification for governments to displace existing users of resources and the ways in which smallholder farmers use their water remain unrecognized some can create new scarcities for others			0
the hidden aspects of water grabbing do not just make it a very " slippery " terrain , but also imply that large - scale land acquisitions all around @entity3 actually can be understood as " water grabbing			1
" that we call this a process of grabbing does not mean that these deals are strictly illegal , but there are serious underlying social justice questions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 .			2

large - scale land deals in @entity3 can be seen as " water grabs , write three researchers
taking land for development often has implications for for local people 's water rights
@entity250 , @entity237 and @entity238 ask : who has the right to the water in a river ?
