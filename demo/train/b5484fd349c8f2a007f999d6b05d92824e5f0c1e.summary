@entity0 -- president @entity2 said friday he had ceded his presidency bid to the country 's powerful prime minister @entity4 because the latter is a more popular politician in @entity8 , who has higher chances to be elected			1
" prime minister @entity4 is definitely the most authoritative politician in our country and his rating is somewhat higher ( than mine ) , " @entity2 said in a taped interview with @entity8 's national tv networks			1
public opinion polls in @entity8 have invariably indicated that @entity4 has been ahead of @entity2 in popularity ever since they constructed their ruling tandem almost four years ago			1
according to the most recent poll , conducted by independent @entity22 , the approval rating of @entity2 stood at 62 per cent in september , compared to @entity4 's 68 per cent			1
in his friday television interview @entity2 said that he and @entity4 belong to " the same political force " and have " very close positions on all strategic and tactical issues " and therefore should n't compete or quarrel			1
" can we possibly imagine , for instance , ( @entity31 president ) @entity30 competing with ( secretary of state ) @entity32 ? " @entity2 asked			0
" both of them were bidding for the presidential nomination ... both were from the @entity37 , and ( the party ) finally decided which of them should run to gain the best election result			0
our decision was the same , " @entity2 said			0
" we want to achieve a political result , to win the elections -- the parliamentary elections in december and the presidential elections in march -- not to be nursing our ambitions , " @entity2 said			2
" any responsible person 's ambition is to serve his country , and i insist on that , " he said			0
commenting on the statements made by some people that the outcome of the @entity8 presidential elections is " predetermined " , @entity2 said , " i consider such statements absolutely irresponsible , deceitful , and even provocative			0
" " the decisions made at the congress are only recommendations to the party to support two people in the elections , no more than that , " he said			0
last saturday @entity2 called on the ruling @entity63 party to endorse @entity4 for president in 2012			1
@entity4 in turn suggested that @entity2 should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in december , in what would be a straight swap of their roles			1
the announcement ended more than two years of speculation about whether @entity4 or @entity2 , his hand - picked successor , would seek to run for a second term			2
@entity4 had stepped down as president in 2008 because the @entity8 constitution at that time limited the office to two consecutive four - year terms			0
under amendments to the constitution that came into force on december 31 , 2008 , the presidential term was extended to six years			0
this means that if @entity4 is elected in march 2012 for six years , he would be eligible to run for another six - year term after that , potentially keeping him in charge until 2024 .			2

@entity2 says @entity4 has a better chance of being elected
he says he and @entity4 belong to " the same political force "
@entity4 has suggested @entity2 take over as prime minister
