@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 donned the plaid shirt and jeans again wednesday to take on a familiar activity of eating local food and shaking hands , a normal day from his not so distant past -- and perhaps his near future			1
the 2012 @entity12 nominee stopped for some barbeque at the @entity14 in @entity1 less than a couple hours before changing into a suit for a speech at @entity17			1
an older man sitting in a booth shook @entity0 's hand and urged him to run for president			1
" we need you up there in the @entity25 , " he said			0
" you 're very kind , " @entity0 replied , patting the man on the arm			1
" i wish i were there right now , i got ta tell ya			0
" as @entity0 positions himself for a possible third run for president , he 's sketching out what appears to be a new platform that would be heavy on anti-poverty policies and reaching out to nontraditional voters			2
related : @entity0 on minority outreach : ' stop thinking so much about the primary ' the millionaire also has the challenge of overcoming a narrative leftover from the 2012 campaign that he was out of touch , and he 's already signaled some ways he might reveal a more authentic self if he runs , the @entity39 reported			1
at the restaurant , @entity0 teased the reporters who stood close by as he munched on his pulled pork sandwich , saying there 's " an unwritten rule " about not taking pictures of politicians eating			2
but he continued to eat anyway			0
" do you still consider yourself a politician , then ? " one reporter asked , to which @entity0 replied : " you 're taking my picture			2
what can i say ? " another asked if this is " the new @entity0 , " noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras			2
" i did n't know i had a choice , " he shot back , drawing some laughs			0
after @entity0 inched through the restaurant to meet students , sign books and take selfies , he sat down with the university 's football coach , @entity70 , who led the bulldogs to the @entity73 this year			1
@entity0 compared the leadership styles of running a business and coaching a football team			2
in politics , @entity0 argued , there 's too much emphasis on what a person says , rather than what a person does			0
" it 'd be nice if people who run for office , that their leadership experience and what they 've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on , but it 's not , " he said			0
" it 's mostly what you say			0
" what you do , @entity0 continued , to argue , " is a lot more important that what you say , " noting how a football coach 's reputation is almost entirely based on his record			0
" you could be the sweetest talking person in the world , but unless you got a record , you 're in trouble , " he said			0
. while he does n't seem to miss the close scrutinizing that comes with running for president , @entity0 spent the first half of his speech later that night dishing out some 2012 nostalgia laced with self - deprecating humor			1
he said he received some advice from someone he met on the campaign trail to stop shaving so he can " grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy			1
" " as if i needed that , " @entity0 said flatly , drawing a big laugh from the audience			0
still , he called it " the most remarkable " journey of his life , and mentioned ordinary people whom he calls " heroes " that he met on the campaign trail			1
he specifically named two people in @entity125 and @entity126 who followed him to a hoard of campaign events , and he praised them for devoting their lives to people they believed would " make the country better			0
" @entity0 offered no specifics about where he stands in his decision making process , but felt confident that " the great days of @entity136 have not ended ; they 're ahead with the right kind of leadership			1

@entity0 met with *college* students at @entity17 in @entity1
his stop at a barbeque joint was *reminiscent* of his 2012 campaign days on the trail
