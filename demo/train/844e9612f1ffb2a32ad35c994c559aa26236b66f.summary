-- a word of warning : you might notice a few more unshaved upper lips proudly displayed by men in the next few weeks			0
do n't worry , it 's not males the world over being lazy			0
they 're actually growing that @entity9 for a good cause			0
during @entity13 ( the month formerly known as november ) , men around the globe grow mustaches ( hence the name ) while raising money for men 's health issues			1
@entity13 started in @entity18 in 2003			1
it has spread from down under to @entity19 and @entity20 , and five years ago it reached @entity22 shores			1
this will be the fifth year @entity25 native @entity24 has participated in the global charity event			0
@entity24 came to the @entity22 two years ago for work and said he is just like any other guy			1
submit your @entity13 photos to @entity31 ! his reasons for joining the @entity13 movement are simple : " i had family members deal with prostate cancer and friends with depression issues			1
... there 's not a whole lot out there in terms of support for men with charities			2
it 's not talked about that much			0
" he said men in general are n't good at committing to regular health screenings			2
" we 're pretty terrible at it			0
" but before you sign up and start growing a ' mo all willy - nilly , there are rules for this sort of thing , as laid out by the nonprofit group			1
first and foremost , the registered participant must start november 1 clean - shaven			2
second , you need to maintain your mustache : grooming is key			2
there are also rules pertaining to gentlemanly behavior , as well as rules preventing the mustache from touching one 's sideburns ( as this is a beard ) or joining the mustache 's handlebars to your chin ( as this is a goatee )			1
the goal is to get your friends to donate money to your @entity13 cause , which is then donated to the @entity76 , @entity77 and other men 's health research and awareness programs			1
so far @entity22 have raised $ 7.5 million for @entity13			1
worldwide , participants have raised $ 174 million , which , according to @entity13 , makes the group the largest nongovernment funder of prostate cancer research in the world			1
according to the @entity88 , one in every six men will get prostate cancer during his lifetime , and one in every 36 will die from the disease			0
behind lung cancer , prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men			0
@entity24 got some interesting looks when he started growing his stateside ' stache			0
" it 's a lot bigger thing in @entity18			0
every second guy has a mustache			0
everyone applauds it , " he said			0
with a chuckle , he added : " back home , the ladies like it when you have a mustache growing in @entity13			1
here , not so much			0
" first - time mustache grower @entity111 is excited about his friends ' reaction to his new facial hair			2
he has never grown a mustache and was prompted to join @entity13 by some @entity118 buddies			1
the " marriage of social media and @entity13 is perfect , " said @entity111 , who is actively involved in social media in his job as director of marketing for a popular restaurant group in @entity123			1
for @entity111 , @entity13 kills two birds with one stone			2
" i wanted to help bring attention to men 's health issues , which is something , i believe , that does n't get the attention it deserves			1
plus , i always wanted to try to grow a mustache			2
" like most men , he recognizes that he does n't go for health screenings as often as he should			2
" that 's another reason i 'm doing this : to make a commitment to myself to take better care of my own health			2
" at the end of the month , parties are held around the globe to celebrate those " who sacrificed their upper lip for the month			0
" men dress up as famous mustache - sporting characters , such as the @entity150			1
@entity24 went as @entity151 last year -- complete with tweed and his pants tucked into his socks			0
he likes that " everyone ( there ) has something in common			0
you 're all there for a good cause			0
" ' @entity162 soirees have grown in popularity , prompting the fifth annual " @entity164 , " put on by the @entity165			1
this year the bash will be held in @entity167 , which was deemed to be @entity22 's most mustache - friendly city			1
the event also benefits @entity77 and the @entity76			0
the facial hair advocacy group has been around since 1965 and touts itself as " committed to battling a demonstrated discriminatory culture against people of mustached @entity22 heritage " by " promoting the growth , care and culture of the lower nose forest			1
" all jokes aside , the @entity165 and @entity13 hope to raise awareness about an often less thought about issue , men 's health			1
so , if you happen to see more mustaches in november , do n't give that person a funny look			0
instead , think about donating to their hairy cause or at least be inspired to get a health screening .			0
