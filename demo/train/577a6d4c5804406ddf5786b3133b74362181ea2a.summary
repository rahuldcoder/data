when your city has an unenviable reputation for insulting tourists and fleecing them for every cent , inviting hotel guests to pay what they want could be a risky move			1
that 's the experiment being tested by several hotels in the @entity11 capital during the height of the summer season			2
" it 's something like a trust contract between the client and the hotel , " says @entity14 , who came up with the " @entity15 " ( pay what you want ) concept as a gimmick to promote @entity20 , his three - star hotel in the city 's @entity23 district			1
@entity14 has recruited four other city center hotels , variously rated with three and four stars , to the scheme which runs from july 21 to august 10			2
he tells @entity32 he struck on the idea after successfully running an honesty bar that left it up to guests to declare their booze consumption at check - out			0
in the @entity40 , it seems hotel guests are not generally light fingered			1
allowing them to choose their own room rates -- instead of paying typical charges of about $ 250 -- will not only bring in the punters , but will also give the hotel valuable feed back , he adds			0
" we put guests at the heart of the system and we transform them into a mystery customer			0
they will look at the hotel with a new eye and if they play true in this game , it can work			1
" if guests decide their stay is barely worth a dollar -- or euro , this being @entity40 -- then it could it could also wind up being an embarrassing financial disaster			1
@entity14 does n't think so			0
friendlier to tourists " if the client wants to pay one euro , there 's nothing i can do , but people will know that this approach is not a good deal , we 'll explain it 's not fair if they pay one euro			2
" " we could have run a promotion offering free rooms to the first 15 people to answer a question on our website , but we 've decided to do this instead			0
" @entity14 says the scheme has attracted interest from other hotels in @entity40 and elsewhere in @entity11 , with several in @entity87 and @entity88 planning similar deals for the winter low season			1
the pay - what - you - want scheme follows recent comments by @entity11 's foreign minister , @entity93 , that the country needs to be friendlier and more accommodating to visitors if it want to protect an annual tourism income of $ 16 billion			1
@entity14 said his scheme was n't a response to this and complained that the government should be doing more to help hoteliers during tough economic times			0
" to be friendly to the tourists @entity93 must cut the hotel taxes and charges , then @entity40 will be better and more attractive and not so expensive			2
" it 's unlikely , however , that @entity93 will let them set their own tax rates			0
what would you pay if you could choose your room rate ? let us know in the comments .			0

five hotels in @entity40 have signed up to the pay - what - you - want scheme during peak summer *months*
@entity118 says the plan is to *create* a " trust contract " between client and hotel
he says guests could pay one euro for a hotel room but believes most will " play true "
