@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 should be arrested			1
not because he does n't like @entity4 but because he got up in front of a group of people and insinuated he would attempt to assassinate @entity4 if he 's re-elected			1
or let 's put it this way : a man with a truckload of guns has threatened the life of our president while the country 's at war			1
@entity3 's words were : " if @entity4 is elected , i 'll either be dead or in jail this time next year , " which sounds to me like he 's open to directing his disapproval of @entity4 in a way that is violent and unlawful			1
when you see that statement next to @entity3 comparing @entity4 and his colleagues to coyotes that needed to be shot , as well as the need to " ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in november , " i do n't see how that rant can not be looked upon as a threat on the president 's life			1
@entity36 : opinion - " i want to live in a world where you can speak your mind " i do n't care how you feel about @entity3 's music or @entity4 's policies , it seems that if there were a @entity46 line to cross , that would be it			1
and yet , the reality is the @entity48 will spend a little time investigating @entity3 , determine he 's not a true threat , and move on			1
if the @entity51 can rule in favor of an 18 - year - old man who , in voicing his opposition to being drafted for the @entity55 , said : " if they ever make me carry a rifle the first man i want to get in my sights is @entity60 , " then it 's doubtful anything is going to happen to @entity3			1
at least anything involving jail time			2
people are still free to organize boycotts and express disapproval			0
the @entity46 protects freedom of speech but it can not insulate folks against the social and cultural repercussions that come from saying something offensive			0
@entity3 should be in jail			1
but he 's just a piece of low - hanging fruit			2
we already know he 's a wild man who makes inflammatory remarks to stay relevant			2
we also know he 's not the only media figure who shocks for a living			0
the bigger question is why is it ok to say you 're going to kill the president , and by ok , i mean legal ? true , because president @entity4 is black he has attracted a unique breed of critics , such as @entity88 , who in 2008 was arrested but later set free after posting " re : @entity4 fk the n * * * * r , he will a .50 cal in the head soon " on a @entity93 message board			1
he also posted " shoot the n * g. " @entity4 is hardly the only president to have a @entity98 citizen publicly threaten his life			1
and yet , like @entity88 , the people issuing the threats are protected under a law that yanks the teeth out of another law , one that makes it a felony to threaten a president or major presidential candidate with death or bodily harm			0
in order to get a jail sentence to stick , prosecutors must prove the individual has made plans to carry out such a threat			0
so even though law enforcement found a .50 caliber muzzle - loading rifle in @entity88 's home -- the kind of bullet he said would soon be in @entity4 's head -- that was n't enough to keep him in jail			1
i do n't know about you , but i find that to be a bit unsettling , especially nowadays , when we have almost as many guns in the @entity98 as we do people -- the highest rate of any country in the world of civilian gun ownership			1
forty - nine states allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons outside of their home for protection , including in some cases , bars			0
who needs a plan when you can be ticked off , get liquored up and then go attend a rally ? i 'm not anti-gun			0
allowing people to threaten the life of a president , particularly during time of war , is not protecting free speech as much as it is dangerously close to treason as it is defined in @entity153 of the @entity154			1
we have an agreed - upon system to replace elected officials we do n't like			0
if people do n't like the president , they can say that			0
they can vote against them			0
but they should n't be allowed to go on the @entity168 or radio and threaten his or her life			0
i felt that way about @entity175 , i feel that way about president @entity4 , and i will feel that way if @entity178 gets elected			2
that 's because this conversation is n't about them or the parties they represent			0
it 's about maintaining some level of respect for the office			2
how can we begin to talk seriously about " restoring @entity98 " -- whatever that means -- when we openly threaten the life of our chief ambassador ? @entity98 presidents @entity191 , @entity193 , @entity194 , and @entity195 were all assassinated			0
six @entity98 presidents survived assassination attempts			0
i 'm not surprised to hear such comments from @entity3			2
but i am surprised that in a country with 106 million handguns , 105 million rifles , 83 million shotguns and four assassinated presidents , we do n't take such talk more seriously			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : @entity3 should be tried and go to jail for insinuating he *'d* kill @entity4
threatening a president at a time of war needs to be taken seriously , @entity212 writes
@entity212 : consider that we have highest rate of civilian gun ownership in the world
@entity212 : this *disrespects* the office : it 's *wrong* if it 's directed at a @entity227 president too
