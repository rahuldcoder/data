-- if you want to know why there 's little cooperation in @entity5 these days , i 'd start with a campaign promise made in 1988 by presidential candidate @entity7			1
" read my lips : no new taxes			0
" so , when he raised taxes two years later , quite naturally , voters , particularly conservatives , were upset			0
if you want to know why so little is being accomplished in @entity5 these days , i 'd start with that broken promise and what @entity7 did in an attempt to get those conservatives back			1
he carried @entity20 's bags			1
in 1992 , president @entity7 invited @entity20 for a sleepover and personally brought his guest 's bags into the @entity26 bedroom for him they were not friends			1
in fact , @entity20 did n't care for @entity7 that much , and " 41 " knew it			1
but @entity7 was seeking re-election			1
he was saddled with a slumping economy and locked in a tough battle with gov. @entity34 and businessman @entity35			0
he believed he needed @entity20			1
the party has been carrying @entity20 's bags ever since			1
so , if you want to know when @entity5 became so polarized , maybe we should circle august 1 , 1988 , exactly 25 years ago			0
that was the day a satirical talk show host syndicated his act and , in the process , made a lot of money and became one of the most influential figures in @entity50 politics today			2
" have any of you heard of an individual by the name of @entity54 ? " @entity20 asked on his show in june 2012			1
" @entity56 ? he has not heard of @entity54			2
@entity57 , have you ? @entity59 , have you heard of @entity54 ? prior to last night i had not heard of @entity54			2
" which is n't true			0
in june 2011 , @entity20 brought me up on his show as well , going so far as to say , " you can blame me , @entity54 , all you want , and i 'll take it			1
" it only takes a few seconds on " the @entity66 " website to find out those facts			0
but @entity20 is n't on the air to provide facts , he 's there to entertain			1
many of his listeners understand that			0
and many of them do n't			0
a 1994 @entity78 article leading into the midterm election called @entity20 " a kind of national precinct captain for the @entity85 insurgency of 1994 " and documented caller after caller legitimately asking the @entity88 -- he calls himself that on occasion -- for guidance			1
during the @entity91 debate , callers were actually asking @entity20 , a shock jock in the mold of @entity94 , what was in the bill			2
he even threatened to move to @entity97 if it was implemented , which seemed counterintuitive , considering @entity97 has universal health care			0
but it 's moments like that when you remember that @entity20 's purpose is n't to provide thoughtful political discourse			1
it 's to vent on his listeners ' behalf , to appeal to their censored side			2
the side that wants to hear a white man say " nigga " in public or call a woman a " slut " without getting fired			0
if that makes you laugh , then he 's doing his job			2
if that disgusts you , well that 's his job , too			0
@entity20 has had us on this yo - yo since the moment he assumed the role of @entity124 in the @entity125 25 years ago			1
back then , it was only offensive , because he was the party 's megaphone , warning listeners about the impending invasion of welfare queens with his mixture of righteous indignation and half - truths			1
it became destructive when listeners and politicians alike made him its spokesman : a pseudo-politician free from the burden of actually having to do anything			1
in rebutting the legitimacy of climate change , @entity20 once told listeners the @entity50 had more acreage of forest land today than at the time the @entity148 was written			2
that was n't true , of course , but it sounded good			0
not too long ago , he read what he believed to be passages from @entity155 's senior thesis , passages that expressed a disdain for the @entity50 @entity148			0
sadly , the whole thing was made up by a blogger			0
and while @entity20 did sheepishly tell listeners what he had read earlier was false , the host still found a way to justify reading it by saying , " we know he thinks it			2
" some folks eat that kind of stuff up			0
some get riled up about it			0
and the folks in @entity5 ? well , after 25 years , they 're still not quite sure what to do with it or him			0
if you 're a @entity177 , do you ignore him ? if you 're a @entity85 , do you carry his bags ? i imagine it 's like that feeling you get when someone tells you something that you ca n't determine is a joke or not			1
you just stand there half - smiling like an idiot			1
so , if you want to know what the folks in @entity5 are doing about the economy , i 'd start there			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity54 .			2

@entity54 : president @entity7 in 1992 , seeking @entity20 's support , carried his bags
@entity85 has been @entity20 's *bellhop* ever since he got influential , he says
@entity197 : @entity20 throws around half - truths and insults . some are disgusted , others entertained
@entity197 : but it 's destructive when *people* , politicians make him some sort of spokesman
