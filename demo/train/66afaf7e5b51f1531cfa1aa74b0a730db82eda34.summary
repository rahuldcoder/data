-- @entity2 plans to start combining information the company collects about each user of its various websites and services into a single profile , the company announced on tuesday			1
previously , @entity2 said it did not create comprehensive profiles across its various properties , including its leading search engine , @entity13 smartphone operating system and @entity15 video site			1
in a statement , @entity16 , a @entity2 privacy director , wrote that the changes " will mean a simpler , more intuitive @entity2 experience			2
" she added , " our recently launched personal search feature is a good example of the cool things @entity2 can do when we combine information across products			2
" that change , called @entity28 , brought criticism from rivals @entity30 and @entity31 , which said that @entity33 content now buries their own pages in @entity2 's search engine , and from people who do not care to use @entity2 's new social network			0
the new privacy policy , too , has already sparked concerns voiced on social networks , including on @entity2 's own platform			1
" @entity2 consolidating data -- gives me some cause for concern , " @entity42 , a professor of information technology at the @entity44 , wrote publicly on his @entity33 profile			1
a @entity2 spokeswoman declined to comment and instead referred @entity0 to @entity16 's statement and a brief document posted on the company 's website			0
the latter notes that @entity2 does not sell users ' personal info to other companies , and that people who do not like the changes can close their accounts			0
@entity2 uses some of the data it collects based on people 's usage in order to deliver advertisements customized to individuals			2
@entity16 boasted in her company blog post that the single , shorter privacy policy should appease government regulators who have called for simplifications across the industry			1
@entity30 made a similar claim last year when it removed much of the legal jargon from its privacy agreement			0
@entity2 's new privacy policy will go into effect on march 1			1
it applies to everyone who is logged into a @entity2 account while searching , checking @entity79 , watching @entity15 videos or downloading apps to an @entity13 phone			0
