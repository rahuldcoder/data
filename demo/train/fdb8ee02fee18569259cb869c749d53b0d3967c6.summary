only 61 people in the history of the @entity2 have held the position			0
it 's the second most powerful in the country and second in line to the presidency			0
but after this week , not many people may want to be speaker of the house			0
@entity11 , the chain - smoking , politically moderate , congressman from southwestern @entity13 who has held the job for the past three years , has seen his power to corral his @entity18 caucus tested			1
he 's just come out on the losing end of a ferocious battle with president @entity21 to reopen the government and avert a possible default			1
" we fought the good fight , we just did n't win , " @entity11 told a @entity25 radio station on wednesday			1
a @entity18 congressman who was in a closed - door meeting late wednesday afternoon with the caucus told @entity32 's @entity31 : " speaker @entity11 said , ' look , i do n't want everybody beating each other up			1
i know this is n't everything we want , but we 're going to live to fight another day			0
' " @entity11 -- who despite his very public defeat is still safe in his job as the @entity40 leader , say some key conservatives -- received a standing ovation wednesday afternoon during that meeting of the entire @entity40 @entity18 conference			1
" i 've actually been very proud of @entity11 the last two - and - a - half weeks			2
i do n't think that he should be ashamed of anything he has done , " rep. @entity45 of @entity46 told reporters			2
but @entity21 has doubted @entity11 's ability to get things done , saying earlier , " he ca n't control his caucus			1
" still , @entity54 , who held the position during the last government shutdown in the mid 1990s , put it this way : " it 's actually the hardest job in the city			0
" @entity11 urges @entity40 @entity18 to support @entity61 deal the inside game @entity11 has been challenged by the small but powerful right wing of the @entity18 caucus : the @entity66 conservatives			1
he was reluctantly pushed into adopting a tactic to link the debt ceiling and funding the government to defunding @entity21 's signature health care plan , known as @entity71 , even though he was against the idea himself			1
ultimately , that tactic failed			0
but wrangling with the tea party is n't his only challenge			0
his members range from the rebellious rep. @entity77 of @entity78 , who publicly rebuked @entity11 by calling instead for a " bold " leader , to rep. @entity80 of @entity81 , a @entity18 who represents an urban , @entity83 - leaning district			1
and they all have different agendas and different ideas of how to push back against a @entity83 @entity61 and a @entity83 president			1
still , he needs their support -- he needs at least 217 of his 232 republicans to pass a law -- because no speaker wants to rely on members of the opposite party to pass legislation			1
that 's the fastest way to lose power			2
but , this time , he had to do just that			0
the entire @entity83 caucus in the @entity40 -- 198 members , with two not voting -- voted " yes " on the bill to end the current crisis while 87 @entity18 joined in to pass the law			1
and this is n't the first time he 's had to rely on that formula			1
@entity18 shutdown pain may boost @entity83 in 2014 the heavy lift " until you 've tried it , you can not imagine the energy level it takes to try to do what @entity11 is doing , " @entity108 said			1
but the latest quagmire over government spending and the debt limit once again display @entity11 's challenge			1
early on , many said @entity11 would never get conservative members of the @entity18 to acquiesce on federal spending and the debt ceiling , and would need @entity83 to get anything through			1
even when the stakes were highest and public opinion polling against his efforts , @entity11 still struggled			2
he straddled the @entity18 caucus and the president in negotiations , but ultimately fell short			2
as the tide was shifting and the @entity61 deal took shape earlier this week , @entity11 made one last stab to get @entity18 demands attached to the bill			2
but he could n't get consensus among the @entity18 and the effort collapsed late on tuesday			0
" it 's a very severe problem if he gets beaten ... and if he gets beaten publicly , " @entity108 said			0
instead of losing , @entity11 simply did n't hold the vote			1
cruz : @entity61 @entity18 should have followed @entity139 he 's lost before but this was n't the first time @entity11 came up short , struggling numerous times to find agreement			1
last year , he was forced to pull a bill providing aid to @entity148 victims because he did n't have enough @entity18 support			0
and during the debt ceiling fight in 2011 , spending cuts totaling $ 900 billion were not enough for some members of his caucus to agree to raise the debt ceiling			2
at the last moment he had to pull the bill and pull out of negotiations with the president			0
@entity21 blamed " the extreme faction in his caucus " for handcuffing @entity11			1
" so there are been repeated situations where we have agreement and then he goes back and it turns out that he ca n't control his caucus , " @entity21 said			1
@entity11 and @entity21 have not successfully completed a negotiation			1
other leaders , including vice president @entity167 , senate republican leader @entity168 and senate majority leader @entity169 have had to carry critical negotiations over the finish line			0
and @entity18 got very little out of this deal			0
@entity71 is still law and government spending was not reduced			0
furthermore , public opinion is blaming the @entity18			0
@entity32 poll : americans to blame @entity18 for shutdown @entity11 the hero @entity180 , a @entity181 expert with the @entity182 , said this saga has been a " nightmare " for @entity11			2
but he said his speakership is not yet over			0
" he is shaken but not yet fallen , " @entity180 said			0
" i think that @entity11 has listened to the @entity2 people , " @entity186 , co-founder of @entity187 said			2
one conservative group , @entity189 , said they do n't worry much about @entity11			2
" we do n't get a vote in who the @entity193 is , " spokesperson @entity190 said			0
9 things we missed during the shutdown the organization works to elect conservative members			0
they are notorious for running primary challengers against @entity18 incumbents who do n't prove their conservative cred			0
" if there are enough conservatives in the @entity40 , the direction of the @entity40 will take care of itself , " @entity190 added			0
until next time the deal to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling simply punts the same issues until early 2014			0
it 's likely that a similar fight will happen again in a few months , once again pitting @entity11 in the middle of his @entity18 caucus and @entity21			1
in an interview on @entity32 's ' @entity223 , " senator @entity216 , @entity217 , clearly said what a lot of people in @entity220 are thinking			0
" obviously , i do n't envy the position that speaker @entity11 has been in , " she said			1
a deal for now , but this year 's been a legislative dud for @entity21			2

@entity11 has seen his power tested in trying to corral conservatives
he told fellow members at a meeting : " i do n't want everybody beating each other up "
president @entity21 doubts speaker 's ability to get things done , saying he ca n't control his caucus
@entity11 has had to rely on @entity83 *previously* to pass key bills
