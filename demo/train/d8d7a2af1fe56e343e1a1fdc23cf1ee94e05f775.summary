@entity0 -- president @entity3 's decision to follow through on plans to reduce the @entity6 troop level in @entity7 to 50,000 and shift away from combat missions is a sign that he believes @entity6 's energy and resources can better be used elsewhere , says analyst @entity12			1
@entity3 said tuesday the @entity6 is on track with the troop withdrawal and mission change to take effect at the end of this month			1
the president is proceeding while @entity7 's key political forces remain deadlocked over the makeup of the government			1
" i think he views it as fundamentally a place where we have to reduce our profile , reduce our impact , " @entity12 said , " because ultimately this was an act of hubris that needs to be reined in			2
" in @entity12 's view , the efforts the @entity6 has put into overturning the @entity32 regime and stabilizing @entity7 have not been worth the cost			1
" in the long run , if @entity7 does stabilize and becomes a workable , even a flawed democracy , then i do think that perhaps that judgment will change in the long view of history			1
but right now , if one were being honest , one would have to say it was n't worth it			2
" the author and host of @entity1 's " @entity45 " spoke to @entity1 on wednesday			0
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : president @entity3 says that he 's fulfilling a promise by drawing down forces from @entity7 to 50,000 by the end of this month			1
what 's the significance of that ? @entity12 : i think the greater significance than the troop numbers is that he said that @entity6 forces next month will stop doing combat missions			1
that is really a crucial change -- it 's the culmination of a process , it 's not abrupt -- but it really means the @entity6 military is out of the business of war fighting , of street fighting , the business of tackling militias and basically exists as a training force to help the @entity7 military to stabilize the @entity7 government			1
that gets the @entity6 military more into the role it has played in places like @entity77 and @entity78 , than in the intense war - fighting , counter insurgency mold it 's been in in @entity7			1
i do think it 's an important turning point			0
@entity1 : what 's the state of the @entity7 regime now ? @entity12 : @entity7 remains very troubled			1
you can not pretend otherwise			0
the simplest indication of this is 2 to 2.5 million people fled @entity7 in the years after the invasion , mostly in 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , and from all accounts there is just a trickle of people returning			2
most of the people who left were middle class , most were @entity96 -- the managerial administrative elite of the country			0
the fact that they have n't returned tells you that they still do n't see much of a future for themselves in @entity7 and until the @entity7 government is able to be genuinely pluralistic and genuinely open , genuinely a broad coalition , i think you will have the problems of instability			1
it 's caused by , on the one hand , @entity96 extremist organizations that see the government as @entity115 tyranny and , on the other hand , @entity115 militias that try to combat those @entity96 extremists			0
that 's where we remain -- it 's all at a much lower level , but the fundamental problem has n't gone away			2
the fundamental political problem has never been solved ; there has never been a genuine national reconciliation with a government that is trying to open itself to all segments of @entity7 society			1
the dysfunction that you see , the paralysis , is just the symptom			0
the deeper problem is the political divide			0
@entity1 : in light of that conflict , why is @entity3 proceeding with the withdrawal ? @entity12 : @entity3 believes this is a war we should never have gotten involved in , that it has been a waste of @entity6 resources -- most importantly @entity6 lives but also treasure -- and that his job is to minimize the exposure of the @entity6 to this and reduce our commitments so that he can focus @entity6 's energy and efforts in other places			1
and he 's been very disciplined about this , very unsentimental about it			0
when you say is it still unstable , i think the answer is yes , but i do n't think @entity3 is waiting for this place to become like @entity159 or @entity160 , a developed democracy , before he reduces the commitment to a significantly smaller number			2
@entity1 : which way could this go -- toward further healing or the possibility of renewed civil war ? @entity12 : renewed civil war seems highly unlikely			2
an adviser to @entity169 once put it this way -- he said @entity7 will stabilize once the @entity96 realize that they have lost , and the @entity115 realize they have won			2
and i think that fundamentally has happened			0
the @entity96 realize they ca n't overturn this government militarily			0
of course there are some insurgent groups and some militia activity but basically it 's sporadic and represents a small element of the population			0
the rest of them are dissatisfied , but they 're not going to take up arms			0
and i think the @entity115 realize they have more to gain by staying in the system , which they dominate , than by trying to overturn it			0
so i do n't see civil war , but i think @entity7 is going to remain very unsatisfying to outside observers			1
it does not seem on trajectory to become a happy liberal democracy ... i think the @entity6 should have been playing a much stronger role in pushing the @entity7 government to accommodate all segments of society and create a genuine national coalition			1
under the @entity198 administration , we focused all our attention on the military elements of the problem until very late when @entity169 came in			0
even then the civilian side has not pushed hard to create these compromises and coalitions			0
and under the @entity3 administration , there has been a very weak ambassador who has also had a kind of hands - off role			2
@entity6 influence is diminishing but it 's still considerable , and it 's surprising to me that we did n't use it to try to create a more stable governing coalition ... @entity1 : stepping back , at this point what is the likely verdict of history on the @entity6 involvement in @entity7 ? @entity12 : so far at this point it 's very difficult to make the case that the benefits have overridden the costs			1
as i said , you have 2.5 million @entity7 who fled , thousands , maybe tens of thousands who were killed , thousands of @entity6 who were killed , enormous expenditure , and there 's not much to show for it			1
it is absolutely true that @entity32 's rule was an evil regime , significantly more evil than your run of the mill dictatorship , this was more like a totalitarian regime , but it 's been replaced by a very dysfunctional polity			2
and to the average @entity7 , it 's been a really , really difficult , unstable seven years , which has been plagued by violence , the collapse of their living standards , constant interruptions in their normal daily life from things like power outages			2
@entity1 : are there lessons here for what the @entity6 is doing in @entity252 ? @entity12 : i think the main lesson i would say is to be modest about what you can achieve and work hard on the political compromises , because those are the key			1
you can achieve a certain level of stability by using the military , but the underlying problem does n't go away			0
and in the @entity252 case , the issue is : can you find a way to get the @entity267 reconciled to the @entity269 government without alienating the other ethnic groups in @entity252 ? we tend not to think in those terms in the @entity6			0
we tend to think of good guys and bad guys , but the truth is that the ethnic divisions are real and lasting , and they just have to be accommodated			0
there has to be a way to share power .			0
