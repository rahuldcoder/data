-- one of the world 's largest private superyachts is the latest to set sail on an expedition to uncover the secrets of a @entity7 battle cruiser lost during @entity8 octopus -- a 414 foot megayacht -- was donated to the @entity11 by @entity12 , co-founder of @entity13			1
@entity12 will fund the recovery and research expedition , sparing the @entity7 government any cost			1
a previous expedition by @entity19 , a deep sea shipwreck recovery company , located the wreck 11 years ago			1
the enduring allure of tall ships this week the recovery team will return to the wreck site with a two-fold mission : retrieve the ship 's bell and document the remains of the battle cruiser in the hopes of later determining what happened in the @entity34 's final moments			1
@entity35 , director of @entity19 , said the ship 's bell was " lovingly looked after " by the crew			1
its recovery is seen by those who lost loved ones as a way to commemorate those who died			2
from the archive : divers find wreck of @entity46 the @entity46 was sunk during a battle in the @entity48 with @entity51 battleship @entity49 in 1941			1
the @entity34 remains the largest @entity11 vessel to have gone down , and resulted in the largest loss of life suffered by any single warship in @entity7 history			1
the wreck of @entity46 is designated under the @entity57 , meaning the recovery team had to seek permission from the @entity11 in order to retrieve the bell			1
the mission was agreed to by the @entity63 , and the @entity64 say the bell -- if recovered -- will form a tangible and fitting memorial to the ship and the 1,415 men who died when she sunk in the @entity48			1
@entity35 recalls the astonishment of the team when they located the ship 's bell , on their first dive , in 2001			1
" there was just a miscellaneous pile of twisted and torn metal ... most of it was very angled steel but there was this curved shape , " @entity35 remembers			0
" we pushed in on the camera and , lo and behold , there was the bell sitting basically unattached , not connected to the ship [ and ] all by itself on its side			1
" the team , @entity35 recalls , " were just stunned by it			2
" the 40,000 ton wreck is strewn over two and half kilometers of seabed , and uncovering the bell was a stroke of luck for the recovery team			1
" it 's a really iconic item and personal symbol of the ship , but we were there conducting this investigation on a ' do n't touch ' basis			1
it never occurred to us , even for a second , ' what if we recovered the bell ? should we attempt to ? ' " @entity35 tells @entity0			2
by the time @entity35 and his team had returned to land , news of the bell 's discovery had broken			2
a public debate had erupted over the ethics of disturbing a wreck where so many lives had been lost			0
@entity35 gained the support of the @entity118 -- whose members include veterans and relatives of those who died -- before seeking financial support to return and recover the bell			0
the association 's president , rear admiral @entity124 , said in statement on the mission : " there is no headstone among the flowers for those who perish at sea			0
" @entity124 added , " future generations will be able to gaze upon [ the @entity34 's ] bell and remember with gratitude and thanks the heroism , courage and personal sacrifice of @entity34 's ship 's company who died in the service of their country			1

@entity35 says : " it 's been out there as a wish of the association to do this and i 've just been looking for the right sponsor to do it in the right way and to get the permission to do it			0
" i 'd been working with @entity163 , @entity12 's company , and it just so happened we could combine the availability of @entity166 in the region at the right time , because you can only really work in this area two months of the year			0
" the @entity166 , the world 's 13th largest megayacht , is a " fantastically capable vessel , " @entity35 says			0

the @entity11 has asked the team to place an ensign on the site of the wreck , @entity35 added			2
the mission also hopes to shed light on the final moments of the battle cruiser , which broke in two during the attack			0
it was under sustained fire from the @entity49 , but its own ammunition also exploded			2
the cause of its sinking has never been clarified			0
" i think we are going to make a real improvement in the imagery and information that we bring back from the wreck to allow naval architects to look at and come to some firm conclusions about the damage , " @entity35 added			0
" this is n't just a trophy hunt to go get the bell			0
" @entity7 monarchy 's long - lasting love affair with the sea			2
