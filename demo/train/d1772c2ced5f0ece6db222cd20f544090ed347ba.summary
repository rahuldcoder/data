when @entity1 wrote of @entity2 as a " bunchback 'd toad , " he did n't have the benefit of actually seeing the king , who had died in the previous century			1
now we know the playwright was probably wrong about @entity2 's physical features			1
scientists have analyzed the bones of the @entity13 monarch and determined that he was not actually a hunchback			2
in fact , he had a significant spinal curve that we would call scoliosis			2
researchers published their latest results thursday in the @entity20			0
" it 's a twist rather than a forward bend , " said study co-author @entity21 of the @entity22 at the @entity23			0
" we were expecting him to have a hunchback deformity the way @entity1 described , " he added			0
@entity2 reigned over @entity29 from 1483 to 1485 and died during the two - hour @entity30 against the forces of @entity32			1
the king 's remains were discovered in 2012 under a parking lot			0
archaeologists determined at that time that @entity2 had scoliosis , a condition characterized by a curvature of the spine			1
researchers wanted to make sure @entity2 was like that in life , not just as a result of his bones having been buried for centuries			2
just by looking at his skeleton , they had clues			0
" a lot of the bones around the maximum part of the curve of his scoliosis were asymmetric			2
one side was different from the other , which shows that the deformity was a genuine thing during life			0
" using computerized tomography , researchers created a three - dimensional reconstruction of @entity2 's spine			1
they also made a model of the spine using a 3 - d printer			1
this let them examine the bones more closely than when the spine was in the ground			0
the spine appeared to have a twist indicative of scoliosis			2
researchers measured the angle of curve and used medical research to understand what @entity2 's life might have been like			1
the diagnosis of scoliosis means @entity2 had a physical health condition in common with about 2 % to 3 % of the @entity88 population , according to the @entity89			1
" @entity91 " actress @entity90 , top golfer @entity92 and @entity94 's character @entity93 all have it , too			0
@entity2 's scoliosis was probably not inherited , and it probably began sometime after he was 10 , researchers said			1
conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy might cause scoliosis , but those are rare explanations , according to the @entity102			0
in up to 85 % of people with scoliosis , including @entity2 , there is no known cause , according to the @entity107			1
doctors call this " idiopathic			0
" normally in scoliosis , the spine takes on a shape that resembles the letter " s " or " @entity114 " children may be prescribed a brace to prevent further curving			2
the @entity107 says patients who are still growing and have curves of more than 25 to 30 degrees , or a curve between 20 to 29 degrees that is getting worse , will be advised to wear a brace			2
@entity2 's spine has a curvature of 70 to 80 degrees			1
anything over 50 degrees is a candidate for surgery , @entity21 said ; the @entity107 puts this figure at 45 degrees			1
research has not proved that chiropractic manipulation , electrical stimulation , nutritional supplementation or exercise stop curves that are worsening , although exercise has other benefits for general well - being			0
the spinal curve probably would n't have reduced @entity2 's lung capacity such that he could n't exercise , researchers said			1
there are other discrepancies between @entity1 's descriptions and the skeleton besides the back problem , @entity21 said			0
the real @entity2 does not appear to have had a limp or a withered arm , as @entity1 had described			2
his trunk and abdomen would have appeared short compared with his arms and legs , @entity21 said			0
his right shoulder would have been slightly higher than the left			0
his curved spine and these other asymmetries would have been more obvious when the king was unclothed than clothed			0
" however , a good tailor and custom - made armour could have minimized the visual impact of this , " the study 's authors wrote .			1

scientists made 3 - d model of @entity2 's spine
he had scoliosis with a curve of about 70 to 80 degrees
today , he would have been a candidate for spine surgery
