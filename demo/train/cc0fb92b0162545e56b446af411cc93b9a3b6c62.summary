@entity0 -- as @entity3 washes his son @entity5 's tombstone in a @entity7 graveyard , he fears that the boy 's spirit rests uneasy			1
the image of the father shielding his 12 - year - old son in a hail of bullets , under the glare of a camera , became the symbol of the second @entity19 uprising , or @entity20			1
thirteen years later , the controversy behind those pictures is still alive			0
an @entity24 government committee concluded in a report presented sunday that the story , which was broadcast by @entity27 in 2000 , can not be substantiated by the pictures			1
children of the conflict : innocence interrupted by war the news report aired by @entity27 stated : " here @entity34 and his son @entity5 are the target of fire coming from the @entity24 position			1
... but , a new round of fire , @entity5 is dead and his father badly hurt			0
" however , the @entity24 government committee report states : " there is no evidence that the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) was in any way responsible for causing any of the alleged injuries to @entity34 or the boy			1
" it 's a statement that pains a still - grieving father			2
but @entity3 is prepared to have his son 's remains exhumed to demonstrate that he was killed by @entity24 bullets , as reported in 2000			1
" i would like to show the world the truth , and i am sitting in front of my son 's grave and ready to accept an international independent investigation commission including @entity62 , " he said			1
" if @entity24 agrees , i am ready to open the grave			2
" the head of the @entity24 government review committee , @entity66 , said he does not know what happened to @entity3			1
showing the raw material provided by @entity27 to @entity1 , he said , " see , he was supposed to be dead			0
he was declared dead a moment ago , understand , he was declared dead when he was lying ( there			0
) that 's where he cut it			0
he said the boy is dead			0
but a second later , he ( @entity3 ) raises his hand			2
" analysis : conflict shifts balance of power in the @entity79 @entity24 places the implications of the @entity3 story in a much wider context			1
prime minister @entity83 said : " it is important to focus on this incident , which has slandered @entity24 's reputation			1
this is a manifestation of the ongoing , mendacious campaign to delegitimize @entity24			2
" there is only one way to counter lies , and that is through the truth			0
only the truth can prevail over lies			0
" the search for that truth has been conducted in courthouses , human rights reports and media investigations			0
cameraman @entity3 , who filmed the event for @entity27 , and also works for @entity1 , has been at the center of trying to understand what happened on that fateful day			2
thirteen years later , he points to the camera that recorded the event as his most solid source , saying : " my witness is ( my ) camera			0
... i am sorry this camera does not talk , but really this camera recorded that footage			0
" @entity3 's story has become an important symbol in the @entity19 struggle for statehood			1
the image of his final moments is shown on stamps in @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
@entity24 says that the false narrative of @entity3 's death has been used to justify terrorist attacks against @entity24 and worldwide anti-semitism			1
