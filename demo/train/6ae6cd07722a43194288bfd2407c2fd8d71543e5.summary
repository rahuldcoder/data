-- he was the football star who came to symbolize one of the reasons why many argued @entity4 should n't be allowed the right to stage the @entity6			1
on friday , a year to the day since he returned to @entity8 following his painstaking exit from @entity4 , @entity7 will take a moment to remember the scarring experience of being trapped inside his @entity13 apartment for months on end			1
" i can not forget what happened ... my head is still in that place , " former @entity16 - @entity15 football player @entity7 told @entity0			1
" i never did anything wrong but my life was ruined and for what ? " perhaps i do n't understand the seriousness of what i achieved in getting out and being able to tell my story			2
" it 's not just about me -- it 's about all the people like me who have also suffered			2
" last year , on november 28 , @entity7 was reunited with his mother and family after returning to @entity16 along with his wife @entity31 and two small daughters			1
@entity33 had become the face of the struggle against " kafala " -- the system which ties employees to a specific employer within @entity4			1
fiercely criticized by pressure groups such as @entity41 and @entity42 , " kafala " has been labeled as facilitating modern day slavery , though recently @entity4 said it had been making progress in reforming the system			1
stranded in @entity4 following a 18 - month pay dispute with football club @entity48 , @entity7 was finally allowed to leave the @entity49 after a lengthy campaign by human rights groups and those on social media			1
@entity7 , who had plied his trade in the lower divisions of @entity16 and @entity57 football , moved to @entity4 in 2007 and initially enjoyed success			1
in 2010 , he was offered a new five - year contract and signed the deal with the ambition of taking @entity48 into the nation 's top division , which he achieved the following year			2
but once @entity48 was promoted , @entity7 was sidelined and told he would not play again			1
there started the problem with his contract -- the club paying him only a small amount of what he was owed until the money stopped completely			2
for 18 months he struggled to feed his family , desperately contacting the @entity16 government and president @entity73 for help while he also sent an open letter to @entity76 and @entity77 , two of the most famous men in football			1
the @entity4 @entity80 denied @entity82 ' allegations , stating that it had helped him recover unpaid wages from a previous club in the country and said the player had not lodged a complaint against @entity48			1
in telephone conversations with @entity0 before he left @entity4 , the footballer confessed he had been driven to drink and suicidal thoughts			1
even now , some 12 months later , it remains a difficult subject , both for him and his family			2
" as a mother , there is nothing worse on earth than seeing your son screaming for help , crying on the phone , hearing him on tv , on radio , " @entity7 's mother @entity93 told @entity0			1
" of course i was aware that he was n't held by some sort of terrorist group , but i felt like that every day			2
" the worst was the article saying he was suicidal , but i want to forget that day , it is haunting me until today			2
" a photograph of @entity33 emerging from the arrivals zone at @entity113 airport and moving almost immediately into the arms of his mother went viral online as the two embraced while cameras flashed and popped			0
" i remember that night , " said @entity7			1
" i was alone in the bathroom and just remember thinking , ' i 've had to come back to my mum 's house like a kid			2
' " i had my wife and children and here i was , back at home			2
" i was a grown man forced to crawl back to my mum -- it was embarrassing			2
" @entity7 suffered from anxiety as he struggled to adjust to his new found freedom			1
" when he arrived in @entity8 , he was like a traumatized animal , scared of everything , " his brother @entity130 told @entity0			2
" it was almost impossible to make him smile or laugh			0
" unable to settle in @entity8 , @entity7 moved to @entity134 in southern @entity135 where he found work at his friend 's restaurant -- as a waiter			1
" in life you have to work , " he said			0
" my friend wanted to help me and i am so grateful towards him			0
" at first it was difficult because i was used to the good life , being a professional football player			2
" but now i have learned the trade and i respect the job of a waiter			0
i 've learned about the restaurant and i am grateful , although i never expected to finish my career like this			0
" last week , @entity4 was back in the headlines after winning the right to host the 2019 @entity154			1
the decision was met with criticism by human rights groups who are unhappy at the @entity160 's treatment of migrant workers			0
in a statement , the @entity162 insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months			0
" a new sponsorship law , currently under review , that will replace the outdated " kafala " system will be announced by next year , " said the statement			0
" we are also working on laws to cover domestic workers			0
" as in every country in the world , change does not happen overnight			0
significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish , but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in @entity4			1
" our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year			0
" while @entity7 says he is encouraged by these developments , he is anxious to witness greater progress			1
according to a report by @entity196 and confirmed by the government , 964 workers from @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013			2
the @entity199 has estimated that 4,000 workers could die while working on projects by the time the @entity6 begins			0
according to the @entity4 government , there are over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country			1
" @entity4 's system is not a human system , " @entity7 said			1
" i think they have no choice but to make changes now			0
" the last time i heard the emir speak , he said lots of good things but we want to see some action			0
we have to do something other than talk			0
" i am a victim of the ' kafala ' system and the rules need to be changed so it will never happen again			0
" @entity7 is still awaiting news from the @entity16 justice ministry in his claim for unpaid wages against @entity4 club @entity48 , though he insists his is a struggle that is n't just about money			1
" this is about human rights			0
i hope one day i will see justice and that the @entity4 will come out in public and admit they made a mistake			1
" i want an apology			0
it 's the only thing which will finish this episode			0
" both his mother and brother are desperate for @entity33 to put his time in @entity4 behind him			1
" @entity7 is ready to fight even if we have to go to the @entity240 , " said @entity130			1
" this is n't just about @entity7 , it is about hundreds and thousands of people who are in the exact same position that he was once in			1
" he is the symbol of this human disaster			0
" meanwhile , @entity7 's mother is very much aware of the emotional torment her son has experienced			1
" i can see it in his eyes , because i know my son			0
and i felt he was internally destroyed and fragile			0
" i lost the kid full of joy i knew from before			0
it will take time , but i will get him back , i am sure			2
as for @entity7 he still has flashbacks -- the nights of sleeping on the floor in his @entity4 home , crying while he held his daughters , remain fresh in the mind			1
even now , the picture of his two young girls asking , " what 's wrong daddy ? " haunts him			0
the depression which led him to ponder suicide might have lifted but the memories have n't			0
" i know that it will be a year since i came back but i just want to be alone , " he said			2
" i remember telling my little girls that ' @entity275 does n't have any strength to fight anymore ' but here i am			0
" i am proud of what has happened to me and to be the first to highlight this problem			0
" perhaps i have n't fully realized what i 've done ... but i will sit tomorrow night and i will remember			0
