-- with friday 's defiant statement , the @entity1 massed its troops along familiar fronts in the culture war -- and even opened some new battle lines			1
but it also squandered an opportunity to participate in reasonable dialogue with an @entity9 that has begun losing its appetite for political extremism			1
longtime @entity1 executive vice president @entity12 , eager to keep the rank - and - file " mothers and fathers " among his membership from going soft , sounded themes critical to maintaining gun owners ' collective identity and solidarity			2
these themes included : the @entity1 is reasonable and a good citizen			2
consistent with past practice , @entity12 recounted the @entity1 's horror at the @entity24 and stated its silence came out of respect for the victims			1
others exploit such tragedies , @entity12 said , but the @entity1 and its members are better than that			2
did the @entity1 miss an opportunity ? more guns , less crime			1
that is the title of the @entity1 's bible , a 1998 book by @entity39 professor @entity38 ( whose core findings have been refuted by other scholars ) , and it is the logic behind the @entity1 's proposal to put an armed officer in all 140,000 @entity9 schools			1
the proposal is founded on the @entity1 's position that guns are merely tools that can be used by " monsters " or by " good guys			1
" the @entity1 and its allies are good guys			2
the great divide : little common ground with pro- and anti-gun forces gun owners are the victims			0
to the @entity1 , gun ownership is fundamental to virtuous citizenship			2
go to any @entity1 convention , or look around the group 's website , and you will learn that gun owners are the true @entity9 patriots , the only force standing between democracy and a tyrannical state delivered by emotional elites with naive but dangerous ideas			2
when @entity12 said he was there to deliver " the truth , " he was referring to elites ' " false " belief that even modest gun regulations might work			0
when he talked about " political prejudice " or " personal prejudice , " he was referring to the indignities that beleaguered gun owners suffer in a society that has failed to appreciate their civic contributions			0
this is the @entity1 's perspective on the culture war			1
while these themes are familiar , @entity12 broke with precedent in key ways , most significantly with his explosive broadside against journalists , movie studios , video game producers , record labels and elected officials who have failed to embrace the @entity1 's policy goals			1
if you want to blame someone besides the shooter for @entity24 , then blame the " enablers " and @entity1 haters and purveyors of " dishonest thinking			0
" @entity12 's attempt to shift the focus to anything but guns was predictable , but the particular message may have some resonance			1
a @entity109 poll found that 47 % of @entity9 -- including 54 % of women -- thought the @entity24 massacre reflected broader social problems , such as parental failures , moral and religious decline , a general devaluation of life , violent depictions in the media and problems with mental health and its treatment			0
although 18 % cited easy access to guns -- the most popular single answer -- the poll showed that @entity9 are far more likely to see gun massacres in a broader context			0
@entity126 : why would someone own a military - style rifle ? a similar pattern emerged after the @entity130 shooting in 1999 when @entity9 were much more likely to place the blame on family and cultural factors than on failures of gun policy			0
of course , as with airplane crashes and other disasters , gun massacres are the product of many interacting forces , as is the " everyday " gun violence that occurs outside the media spotlight			0
most @entity9 understand the causes are complex and are sensible enough to see that a multipronged approach involving personal , social and public policy action will be needed			0
@entity12 's apocalyptic vision of the " unknown number of genuine monsters " who at this very moment may be plotting the next attack on our schoolchildren -- and the organization 's single - minded and unrealistic call to put an armed guard immediately in all our schools -- felt weirdly out of step with the equally urgent yet more thoughtful conversations occurring at dinner tables around the nation			0
it was a missed opportunity			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0
