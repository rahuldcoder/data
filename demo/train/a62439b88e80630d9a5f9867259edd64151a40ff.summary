@entity0 -- a @entity3 official said he believes the shooting early tuesday at the @entity6 headquarters was a " random incident			1
" " we are looking at all the possibilities , " @entity8 , director of the @entity9 , said at a news conference late tuesday morning			0
" what we have is an isolated incident , so far			1
" @entity3 police officers , as well as several construction workers in the area , heard at least five shots fired around 4:50 a.m. , @entity3 officials said			1
as of midday tuesday , authorities had discovered two bullet fragments in third - and fourth - floor windows on the south side of the building , said @entity8			1
that part of the @entity3 was empty at the time of the shooting , as it is in the process of being renovated			1
the bullets shattered but did not go through the windows , which are bulletproof , according to @entity8			0
the incident prompted a 40 - minute shutdown of the entire @entity3 , and authorities conducted an interior sweep of the building shortly after 6 a.m. @entity8 said authorities were unsure who fired the shots and with what kind of gun , though he said he believes they came from a rifle			1
a portion of @entity45 -- which runs along the south side of the @entity3 -- was also shut down temporarily to conduct a search in the investigation			1
maj. @entity49 , a public affairs officer for @entity50 , said that other temporary road closures may be necessary as the probe continues			0
several law enforcement agencies , including the @entity54 and @entity3 police , are looking at surveillance footage and doing ballistics tests of the bullets found thus far , among other measures			0
tuesday 's shooting follows a similar incident overnight sunday at the @entity62 in @entity63 , @entity64 , near the entrance of @entity66			2
@entity67 , the museum 's director , told @entity1 tuesday that investigators have determined that one or more assailants used rifles to fire 10 bullets at the building -- five hitting glass windows , the rest hitting metal panels			0
authorities have n't pinned down exactly where the shots were fired from , though they believe they came from @entity80 or nearby			0
no one was hurt in that incident , which occurred between 12:15 a.m. and 5 a.m. when the building was unoccupied , @entity67 said			0
no one has claimed responsibility and there were no known threats prior to the shooting , she added			0
military police and the @entity91 are investigating that incident			0
asked if there were any ties between that and the @entity3 shootings , a law enforcement official said that " except for the similarity in the incidents -- windows shot out at military facilities -- there is nothing to connect these incidents at this point			1
" both shots appeared to have been fired from high - velocity rifles , the official said			2
but the @entity54 , which is helping with ballistics tests related to the @entity3 shooting , has yet to see evidence from the @entity113 shooting			1
tuesday 's shooting was the first such incident at the @entity6 headquarters since march , when @entity117 pulled a gun from his pocket and began shooting			2
@entity120 , who had a history of mental health problems , was later shot and killed , while two @entity3 police officers received superficial injuries in the incident			2
