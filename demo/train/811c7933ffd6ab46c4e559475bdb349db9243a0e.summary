@entity0 -- seven states on thursday filed a lawsuit against the federal government requirement that religious employers offer health insurance coverage that includes contraceptives and other birth control services			1
the issue has become a political flashpoint in a presidential election year , and the lawsuit by attorneys general from @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 was certain to keep it prominent			1
private plaintiffs joining the seven states included @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 of @entity27 and private citizens @entity28 and sister @entity30			0
the 25 - page lawsuit named the @entity27 @entity32 and hhs secretary @entity33 ; the @entity27 @entity34 and treasury secretary @entity35 ; and the @entity27 @entity36 and @entity38 secretary @entity37 as defendants			2
it alleges a violation of the @entity42 and of the @entity43 , saying that the requirement for employees at church - affiliated institutions such as hospitals to receive health coverage for contraceptives and other birth control services contravened constitutionally protected religious freedom			1
" government has no business forcing religious institutions and individuals to violate their sincerely held beliefs , " @entity19 attorney general @entity51 said in a statement thursday			1
" this lawsuit is about protecting religious liberty and the rights of conscience , our most basic freedoms as @entity27			1
" @entity20 attorney general @entity64 said the government rule under the health care reform law passed in 2010 " compels people of faith to act contrary to their convictions			1
" " the very first amendment to our @entity71 was intended to protect against this sort of government intrusion into our religious convictions , " @entity64 said			2
@entity64 and @entity51 are republicans			0
officials from the @entity78 and the @entity79 had no comment on the pending litigation			0
however , it is not the first court challenge to the @entity86 administration 's new mandate on contraceptive coverage			1
the @entity88 has filed a series of lawsuits , arguing that even the revised polices on contraception access would constitute a violation of their clients ' faith			0
last week , the @entity79 urged judges to stay out of the controversy until a compromise can be worked out			0
at issue is whether religious institutions should be exempt from mandated employee coverage for birth control and other reproductive care			2
the administration announced a proposed compromise in the dispute earlier this month			2
under its new plan , religiously affiliated universities and hospitals would not be forced to offer contraception coverage to their employees			0
insurers will be required , however , to offer complete coverage for free to women who work at such institutions			0
in announcing the proposed compromise , @entity86 said " no woman 's health should depend on who she is or where she works or how much money she makes			1
" he added that " the principle of religious liberty " was also at stake , and " as a citizen and as a @entity127 , i cherish this right			0
" female employees at churches themselves will have no guarantee of any contraception coverage -- a continuation of current law			0
the @entity135 denounced @entity86 's compromise soon after the president 's announcement , saying the proposal raises " serious moral concerns , " according to a statement posted on its website			1
half of all @entity27 polled say they oppose the @entity86 administration 's new policy , according to a @entity1 / @entity147 survey			1
the final version of the contraception requirement goes into effect next january			0
the administration said that under a safe harbor provision , no group can be forced to provide birth control at least until year 's end			2
@entity1 's @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
