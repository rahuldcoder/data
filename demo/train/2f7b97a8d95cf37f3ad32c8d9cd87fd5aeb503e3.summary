@entity0 -- an independent research group predicts that cyberwarfare will accompany future military conflicts and is recommending international action to blunt its impact			1
computers can become victims in future military conflicts , a nonprofit group says			0
the nonprofit @entity11 @entity10 studied the cybertactics used against the country of @entity14 during its military conflict with @entity16 last year			1
cyberattacks in august 2008 shut down the web sites of crucial @entity14 government agencies , the media and banks			2
" the @entity16 have developed a model here that is very effective , " said @entity22 , director of @entity11 - @entity10			1
" we can expect to see the @entity16 use it in the future , and other countries as well			2
" because of the sensitive nature of much of the information , the full 100 - page report is being released only to @entity11 government officials and selected cybersecurity professionals			2
@entity1 was provided a nine - page summary			0
the study concludes that the cyberattacks against @entity14 targets were carried out by civilians , many of them recruited via social networking forums devoted to dating , hobbies and politics			1
" there was a large - scale collaboration on these forums , " said @entity11 - @entity10 's chief technical officer , @entity44			0
" they were used to recruit potential actors to launch attacks , to collaborate on what types of attacks worked and what types of attacks did n't work			0
they were used to collaborate on how to bypass security controls and share attack codes			0
" as a result , @entity22 said , @entity16 sympathizers who were not hackers , and who did n't even know much about computers , could participate			2
the report says the civilian cyberattackers were aided and supported by @entity16 organized crime			1
although they found no evidence of direct involvement by the @entity16 government or military , the report concludes that the organizers were tipped off about the timing of @entity16 military operations			1
" there was a lot of information being passed on , but at what level it was being passed on was hard to say , " @entity22 said			0
the report says that " the necessary reconnaissance and the writing of attack scripts had to have been done in advance ... and suggests that cyber attacks against @entity14 had been on the @entity16 agenda for some time			1
" the hackers did not carry out physically destructive cyberattacks , although they probably had the technical expertise to do so , suggesting that " someone on the @entity16 side was exercising considerable restraint , " the report says			2
it also notes that media and communications facilities , which might have been attacked by missiles and bombs in a conventional war , were spared that , " presumably because they were being effectively shut down by cyberattacks			0
" because the cybercampaign against @entity14 presents a pattern that can be expected in future conflicts , the report says , there is an " urgent need " for an international organization to provide risk advisories when preparations for a cybercampaign are detected			1
it also says there should be an international cyber-response force to provide quick assistance to member countries , advising them on how to thwart an attack and setting up operations to do so			1
the report also recommends that every country conduct cyber-response exercises , otherwise " the relevant officials will waste precious time trying to figure out whom they should be contacting and what they should be doing			0
" @entity44 said that cyberwarfare " is a global chess game in which citizens , governments and corporations are the pawns			0
" @entity22 added , " right now , the international community has no idea how to deal with this			0

study looked at cybertactics used during @entity16 - @entity14 conflict
civilians recruited from social networks carried out most attacks , report says
international agency needed to advise about risks , group says
another recommendation is *creation* of cyber-response force
