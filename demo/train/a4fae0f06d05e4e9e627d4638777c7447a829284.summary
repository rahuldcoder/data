@entity0 , @entity1 -- it does not make for pleasant dinner conversation			0
but we have a global sanitation crisis			1
more than 40 % of the world 's population does not have access to a toilet			2
these 2.6 billion people , most living in low - and middle - income countries in @entity13 and @entity14 , face the daily challenge of finding a bush , train track or empty lot where they can urinate and defecate in relative privacy			1
between 1990 and 2008 , the share of the world 's population that had access to basic sanitation increased only 7 % , to 61 % of the world 's citizens			1
in many developing countries , mobile phone penetration is expanding at a faster rate than sanitation			2
in @entity34 , for example , half the country 's citizens have mobile phones , but only 24 % use an improved sanitation facility			0
saturday marks the 10th anniversary of @entity38 , a day set aside not simply as a celebration of this most venerable and useful of technologies , but as a way to draw attention to the crisis and some possible solutions			1
this sanitation crisis is not only an affront to dignity			1
it results in the release of hundreds of tons of feces and urine each day directly into rivers , lakes , landfills and oceans , creating an immense human and environmental health hazard			0
every day more than 4,000 young children die from sanitation - related illness			1
fully half of the hospital beds in the developing world are occupied by people whose ailments can be traced to poor sanitation			1
a small but dedicated community that includes governments , ngos , donors and research institutions is working to expand access to basic sanitation services in developing countries			1
they employ a range of innovative strategies , including " naming and shaming " community members who defecate in the open , constructing public toilets operated by entrepreneurs , and providing subsidies to help households build their own facilities			1
in most cases these sanitation champions promote or deliver " on - site " services such as a pit latrine or a toilet with septic tank			1
these facilities capture feces and urine in a chamber under or next to the users ' dwelling			0
when adopted on a wide scale and maintained properly , these solutions can dramatically improve household and environmental sanitation			0
on - site solutions are also popular because they cost less to build , and require much lower volumes of water than a conventional sewer system			0
in addition , some on - site sanitation facilities allow for the possibility of generating biogas for cooking and lighting , and for re-using composted excreta as fertilizer for agriculture			2
given all these benefits from improved sanitation , why has it proven so difficult to expand access to this essential service ? one answer may be that the kinds of sanitation facilities offered to developing country households are not terribly appealing			1
as sanitation guru professor @entity124 of the @entity126 noted two decades ago , " for those accustomed to a contemplative squat in the open air in the cool of the early morning , who among them would choose a dark , damp , smelly and possibly precarious cubicle ? " efforts to keep sanitation as low - cost as possible may also be part of the problem , at least for some consumers			2
researchers from the @entity141 working recently in @entity13 found that households prefer and are willing to pay for higher quality toilets , particularly when they are marketed as a symbol of prestige and modernity , rather than just a preventive health measure			2
this shift toward aspirational marketing is one important step toward generating greater household demand for improved sanitation services			1
in order to turn the tide on the global sanitation crisis , however , efforts are also needed to develop models for low - and no - water sanitation systems at scale , models to which municipal and national governments themselves can aspire			1
in cities across the @entity167 , the transition from outhouses and privies to sanitary sewers occurred more than a century ago , when metropolitan populations numbered in the tens or hundreds of thousands			2
today there are more than a dozen cities in developing countries that have at least 5 million inhabitants , most of whom rely on latrines or toilets with septic tanks			0
municipalities with limited resources struggle to regulate , much less manage , the emptying and safe disposal of sludge from these facilities			0
it is estimated that only 15 % of domestic waste in developing countries undergoes any form of treatment before being discharged to the environment			0
in the @entity167 , our prevailing urban sanitation model has changed little in the past century , with the typical @entity167 flushing more than 12,000 liters of potable water down the sewer every year			1
despite declining per capita fresh water availability , increasing frequency of municipal water rationing and the need to replace a large share of the country 's aging wastewater infrastructure , there is little discussion as to how domestically we might transition to a sustainable sanitation future that reduces freshwater requirements and lowers energy costs			0
waterless and composting toilets are niche technologies , marketed to " ultra-green " consumers and those living in remote locations			0
indeed , the recycling of grey water , even for nonpotable uses such as watering landscapes , is still controversial in many places			0
certainly , most people do n't want to talk about poop , much less debate whether and how it might be recycled in their communities			0
but it is precisely this debate that is needed			0
we need to trigger sanitation innovations that can benefit citizens of wealthy and poor countries , and also instigate systems that help protect the resource base they depend on for development			0
would n't that be something to celebrate ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			2

@entity233 : 2.6 billion people do not have access to toilets , a global sanitation crisis
every day more than 4,000 children die from sanitation - related illness , she says
@entity245 : a dedicated community is working to expand access to basic sanitation services
in the @entity167 , the prevailing urban sanitation model has changed little in 100 years , she says
