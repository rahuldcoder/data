-- to the rest of the world , @entity1 seems to represent all that is enviably @entity5			1
@entity7 's largest country has a reputation for being stylish , progressive and glacially cool -- in short , everything the @entity10 is not			1
so it may come as a surprise to some to learn that the @entity1 take the annual song competition -- occasionally viewed by some of their neighbors as a bit of a joke -- very seriously indeed			1
unlike in many other western @entity5 countries , the privilege of representing @entity1 at the annual contest is hotly contested , through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than @entity10 itself			1
@entity25 , a six - week , " @entity27 " - style tv series in which established acts compete against unknowns for the honor of representing @entity1 , has broken every local ratings record			1
nearly half of the country 's 9.4 million people tuned in to this year 's final			2
" @entity38 is the @entity1 equivalent to the @entity40 , " said @entity36 who produced the tv show in 2006 and 2007			2
" no other tv show gets the @entity1 so rallied up			2
people put on dinner parties just so they can watch it together			0
they even get dressed up for the occasion			0
" forgettable song , memorable outfit : the crazy clothes of @entity10 the show has proven an invigorating force for the @entity1 music industry , reviving old pop careers , launching new ones and selling thousands of records and concert tickets in the process			1
but why do the @entity1 , often viewed as cool , collected tastemakers , get so worked up about a contest widely seen as having little musical credibility ? proud tradition " a lot of people do n't know this , but @entity1 are obsessed with music , " said @entity36 , who followed his stint on @entity25 ( @entity25 ) by producing the @entity1 version of @entity27			1
" not only are all the most popular tv shows in @entity1 music - related , but choral singing is the second most popular pastime after sports			2
it 's only natural for us to get worked up about a music competition			0
" that love of music has translated to a long history of @entity10 success , with the most wins in the competition after @entity79 ( seven ) , @entity80 , @entity81 and the @entity82 ( five each )			1
the @entity83 has also won four times			0
the love affair began when @entity86 won the 1974 contest with their hit " @entity89 , " launching them on their way to becoming @entity10 's greatest success story and one of the biggest - selling pop bands of all time			1
the @entity1 entry this year , " @entity96 " by @entity97 , was the bookies ' favorite to follow in their footsteps and duly delivered success at the 57th @entity10 , in @entity102 , @entity103			1
the tradition of success has seen many @entity1 grow up with " @entity25 " and @entity10 as annual fixtures in their households			1
" watching @entity10 is a national tradition in @entity1 , " said @entity108 , 28 , a motion graphics student from @entity110			1
" when i was a kid it was the only night , apart from @entity113 , that my parents would allow me to stay up past midnight and let me eat as much crisps and candy as i liked			0
" even as an adult , @entity10 remains a big occasion			0
" i watch it with my friends and there 's always someone who will organize a house party where we 'll cook strange dishes from all the different countries and bet money on what song will win			2
people usually take the betting really seriously but we add silly categories like the worst outfit or the worst song			0
" " @entity25 " 's timing -- screening on saturday nights for six weeks in the middle of the country 's famously gloomy winters -- is seen as another reason for its enduring appeal			2
" @entity1 in the winter is very dark and can be quite depressing			0
when ' @entity25 ' starts airing in february we 're in the middle of this season , but every week leading up to the final is a week closer to spring , " said @entity141 , a self - confessed @entity10 addict who works in @entity142 as a primary school teacher			1
" it 's almost as if ' @entity25 ' is the vessel that carries @entity1 from the dark of winter to the light of summer , and soundtracks that journey with some awfully catchy music too			1
" reviving the contest " @entity25 " is nearly as old as @entity10 itself , having run almost every year since 1959			1
but it was n't always such a polished affair			0
" in the 1990s the competition was struggling			0
there were n't enough good artists wanting to take part so it was decided that something radical needed to happen , " said @entity161 , a former hairdresser who won " @entity25 " in 1992			2
so in 2002 , he oversaw the transformation of the contest from one - off contest between ten songs into a six - week pop marathon featuring 32			0
the ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of @entity1 industry experts , and @entity10 judges from 11 other countries			1
the new format , featuring knock - out semi-finals held in cities across @entity1 , was a smash hit , and @entity161 has been involved in the production of every contest since			2
today he is known as " mr @entity25			0
" " taking the show on the road was incredibly important to its success as it galvanized local support , " he said			0
" equally as important was the fact that the audience now have weeks to familiarize themselves with all the songs			0
they form emotional attachments to the songs and , ultimately , also the winner -- which is one of the reasons why so many @entity1 still care about how we do in @entity10			1
" the resulting surge of interest in " @entity25 " sees thousands of songs submitted to the contest each year , and has been a boon to the @entity1 music industry			1
" it 's a goldmine for artists and songwriters that do well in the competition , as they go on to sell thousands of records and sell out tours across @entity7 , " said @entity36			0
" the competition is enormously important for the @entity1 music industry because not only does it launch new careers and revives old ones , it sells a lot of albums too , " he said			0
" from winter until spring , our songs occupy the charts			0
the final was in march , but four of our songs are still in the top ten			0
" ' why not try ? ' the @entity1 are very aware that not every country shares their infatuation with @entity10			1
" @entity227 countries who take themselves quite seriously -- like @entity82 and @entity80 -- do n't really want to compete against all these tiny nations on the @entity5 periphery in some silly music competition , " said @entity36			0
" they think it 's beneath them , so they keep sending bad songs that never win			0
" but given the benefits to @entity1 's music industry from the country 's @entity10 obsession , perhaps the question should n't be why does @entity1 care , but why do n't others ? " ultimately you get what you give , " said @entity161			1
" in countries like the @entity82 they do n't give much -- in fact they keep changing the format of the national try - outs each year			0
it 's no wonder the public has lost interest in ... @entity10			2
" " @entity25 " 's success owes much to the @entity1 tendency not to " do things by half measures , " he said			1
" when we decided to revive ' @entity25 , ' our aim was to create an amazing and engaging tv program that would benefit not only us as broadcasters , but the music industry and the viewers as well			2
i 'm very proud to say that we have succeeded in doing just that			0
