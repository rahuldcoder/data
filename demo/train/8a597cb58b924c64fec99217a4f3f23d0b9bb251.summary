-- history has its holy wars			0
the latter a toddler on the line of time compared with the @entity13 war			1
almost 1,700 years -- and counting -- on when , and how , to celebrate @entity13			1
we 're not talking the @entity15 here			0
no , no , no. obliteration			0
in the early centuries of @entity22 's existence , there was no consensus on the date of @entity26 ' birth , or even on whether the day , whatever it was , should be celebrated as a holiday			0
@entity29 , writing in @entity31 , notes that early @entity32 contended that the date was , variously , may 20 , april 18 , april 19 , may 28 , january 2 , november 17 , november 20 , march 12 and march 25 -- and that december 25 probably did n't emerge as the favored date until late in the third century			0
that , intentionally or not , grafted the new @entity13 onto the old @entity36 , the most popular celebration of @entity38			1
the seven - day festival that started december 17 to honor the god @entity41 and welcome the winter solstice gave us today 's tradition of holiday greenery , gift giving and the office party ( or variations thereof ) , for the @entity36 was a time of much drinking , some carousing , certainly unrestrained revelry			0
the yin and yang of that has come down to us through the centuries and can be seen today in the battles over the commercialization of @entity13 , the popularity of yuletide parties , too many martinis oiling the voices raised in song			1
a little too much " @entity63 " and not enough " @entity64			0
" having enjoyed wonderfully merry and happy @entity66 through the years , as i was growing up and making my way in the world , i took those concerns in stride and kept " @entity71 ! @entity72 ! @entity72 ! " at the ready			1
then , in my early 40s , when i was living in @entity73 , while leafing through a book as part of my research for a story , i hit the subtopic : christmas under the @entity79			1
because it happened to be facing a page with an old - fashioned illustration of a little girl standing under a living room archway trimmed with greenery , i thought the rope of greens was the ban			0
complaints about how to celebrate @entity13 had started early , threaded through the @entity90 , the @entity91 and then came into their own in @entity93			1
@entity13 in @entity94 was seen by the @entity95 as a bit too merry			1
the holiday had come to be marked by bearbaiting , beer and ale , and other spirits flowing in the taverns on @entity103 , rowdy crowds celebrating " the @entity105			0
" come @entity13 morning , minstrel - like parades would march down the aisles in churches where services were being held			1
unable to rein in the excesses , the @entity95 turned their back on @entity13 altogether			1
not just the celebrations and traditions , @entity13 itself			1
it would be just another day			0
their no - @entity13 policy -- no way , no how , spelled @entity120 -- crossed the @entity121 with them on the @entity122			1
when the @entity124 landed at @entity125 in december 1620 , they observed the @entity126 on sunday , but , come @entity13 , went ashore to work			1
opinion : does @entity129 need a ' @entity13 ' law ? back in @entity73 , when the @entity95 came to power under @entity133 , a proclamation was issued in 1652 decreeing that stores should remain open on december 25			1
in @entity73 , such a law was formally on the books in @entity137 -- duly enacted by the @entity138 of the @entity139 on may 11 , 1659 , and not repealed until 1681			1
but @entity13 had its appeal			1
the rev. @entity141 felt it necessary to address its evils in 1687 : " the generality of christmas - keepers observe that @entity147 after such a manner as is highly dishonourable to the name of @entity149			0
how few are there comparatively that spend those holidays ( as they are called ) after an @entity154 manner			0
but they are consumed in @entity156 , in @entity157 , in playing at @entity158 , in @entity159 , in excess of wine , in mad mirth ; will @entity149 the holy @entity163 be pleased with such services ? " in 1711 , the rev. @entity167 -- like father , like son -- railed against the holiday merriment : " i hear of a number of young people of both @entity182 , " he wrote , " belonging , many of them , to my flock , who have had on the @entity173 , this last week , a @entity174 , a reveling feast , and ball , which discovers their corruption , and has a tendency to corrupt them yet more			0
" it was n't just the @entity184 in their pulpits keeping a watchful eye out for signs of @entity13			2
judge @entity189 , who kept a diary that has given historians a rare look at daily life in @entity137 in the 18th century , has numerous diary entries expressing his elation at the sight of people going about their regular , daily business on christmas day , equally disdainful of any signs of awareness or recognition , much less celebration , of @entity13			1
a 1697 entry : " @entity204			0
snowy day : shops are open , and carts and sleds come to @entity208 with @entity209 and @entity210 as formerly , save what abatement may be allowed on account of the weather			0
" the @entity95 were so vigilant , watchful for the slightest sign of " keeping @entity13 , " because they saw any breach as the first step toward falling back under the domination of the @entity218 from which they 'd fled			1
and anyone who " kept @entity13 " became an outcast , literally or figuratively			2
the tide started to turn in the late 18th century			0
the first waves of immigration to lap at the @entity73 shores , like the flood tide that would come in the 19th century , tended to be from countries that observed @entity13			1
not to be underestimated in its importance to the holiday , the ratification of the @entity231 removed the fear of falling back under the heel of the @entity218 when it decreed no establishment of a state religion , in fact , proclaimed a separation of church and state			0
but the @entity95 hold on @entity73 was strong			1
as late as 1856 , december 25 was a common workday in @entity137 , and those who refused to go to work on @entity13 were often dismissed			2
some factory owners would even change the starting hours on christmas day to 5 a.m. -- workers who wanted to attend church services would either have to forgo them or be dismissed for being late to work			0
opinion : where @entity13 really came from @entity250 wrote in a journal entry dated december 25 , 1856 : " not a very merry @entity13			1
we are in a transition state about @entity13 here in @entity73			1
the old @entity95 feeling prevents it from being a cheerful , hearty holiday , though every year makes it more so			2
" across the pond , @entity260 ' " @entity259 , " published december 19 , 1843 , was reconciling the centuries - old war over @entity13 , the two sides clearly shown , battle lines drawn , in the opening pages when @entity265 's nephew drops by			1
" a merry @entity13 uncle ! @entity267 save you ! " cried a cheerful voice			1
" @entity270 ! " said @entity265			0
" @entity271 ! " ... " do n't be cross , uncle ! " said the nephew			0
" what else can i be , " returned the uncle , " when i live in such a world of fools as this ? merry @entity13 ! out upon @entity13 ! ...			1
if i could work my will , " said @entity265 indignantly , " every idiot who goes about with ' @entity13 ' on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding , and buried with a stake of holly through his heart			2
he should ! " " @entity287 , " pleaded the nephew			0
" nephew , " returned the uncle sternly , " keep @entity13 in your own way , and let me keep it in mine			2
" " keep it ! " repeated @entity265 's nephew			0
" but you do n't keep it			0
" that , of course , was before the visits from the @entity297 , @entity298 and yet to come that wrought the 180 - degree turn in @entity265 that , with the help of the @entity302 and @entity303 , gave us the @entity13 we know and love today			2
but pockets of resistance lingered in @entity137			0
in the early 1900s , a bride from @entity309 , where @entity13 was celebrated , married a man from @entity137 , where it was touch and go , and they settled into a place on @entity313			2
as @entity13 drew nigh , she asked around for a group that went caroling and found there was none			2
thinking to start one , she found a problem			0
as the folks put it when they declined : " someone might hear us			0
" as late as the 1930s , some churches in @entity137 would be closed , a printed notice on the doors saying there would be no services @entity13			2
today , the old @entity95 concerns have been reduced to occasional outbursts about the commercialization of @entity13 and the liquid aspect of the good cheer ... while the old carols and the newer songs by such songwriters as @entity335 can be heard in malls , large and small , mingling with the ringing of the bells at the @entity340 collection kettles , or on the radio			1
if " @entity346 " is the best known of the newer songs , the one that conveys how much @entity13 has come to mean to us may be the one that came out soon after when millions of @entity349 servicemen were still overseas -- " @entity351 " ( also recorded by @entity350 )			2
the lyrics added to the poignancy : i 'll be home for @entity13 you can plan on me please have snow , and mistletoe and presents on the tree			2
remember , " @entity366 " ends when @entity368 's brother , who has been away in the service , returns home @entity103 -- joining the family and friends around the christmas tree in time to hear the bell ring when @entity363 , the gentle angel , gets his wings			0
and i 'm keeping @entity13 .			2

@entity372 : how and when to celebrate @entity13 has been debated for centuries
she writes that @entity95 *objected* to " too merry " christmases in @entity94
for 22 years , the @entity139 banned celebration of @entity13
she says the *aftereffects* of the ban lingered for centuries in @entity73
