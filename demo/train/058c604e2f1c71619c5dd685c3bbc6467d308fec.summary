-- now this is about much more than @entity2 and a grand jury 's decision not to indict the officer who shot him			2
from @entity8 to @entity9 to @entity10 , college students nationwide have walked out of classes or staged " die - ins " to decry police violence and racial profiling			1
they 've been joined by demonstrators across the country who say they wo n't stop clamoring for change until they see real action			0
and more and more , the protesters reflect a wide array of races and backgrounds			0
" we come from a privileged background , and it 's easy for many of our friends to deny what 's going on in this country , " one white prep school student told @entity0 affiliate @entity27 as he protested monday in @entity28			1
" but we feel it 's our duty to speak up for what 's right -- speak up for justice			0
" outside @entity38 , a sea of students lay on the cold bricks to draw attention to @entity2 's death			1
others did the same in @entity46 and in front of the @entity48 in @entity49 , mimicking the way @entity2 's body lay on a street for 4 1/2 hours			2
in cities across the country , one sign was so prolific that the words on it proved true : " @entity58 is everywhere			0
" moving forward so how does the country go from die - ins and walk - outs to actual change ? after meeting with law enforcement officials and activists monday , president @entity63 outlined several new efforts			1
" i 'm going to be proposing some new community policing initiatives that will significantly expand funding and training for local law enforcement , including up to 50,000 additional body - worn cameras for law enforcement agencies , " @entity63 said			1
the president addressed concerns about " whether we are militarizing domestic law enforcement unnecessarily			0
" he ordered a review after the widely criticized heavy - handed police response to @entity58 protesters in august , and that review suggests largely leaving intact federal programs that provide surplus military equipment to local police departments			2
but @entity63 plans to issue an executive order to tighten some of the controls over the programs to better track equipment provided to law enforcement agencies			2
the president also announced a new task force , chaired by the @entity91 police commissioner and a criminology professor , that will reach out to law enforcement , community activists and other stakeholders to come up with best practices on creating accountability and trust between communities and police			1
that task force must present their recommendations to @entity63 in 90 days			1
the president admitted than in the past , task forces have fallen short			0
but " this time will be different , because the @entity105 is deeply vested in making it different , " @entity63 said			2
" in the two years i have remaining as president , i 'm going to make sure that we follow through			0
" @entity109 heckled in the first leg of his national dialogue , attorney general @entity109 met with community members at @entity114 's @entity113 -- where @entity115 preached			1
@entity109 's speech was interrupted by a group of protesters chanting , " no justice , no peace " and " we have nothing to lose but our chains			1
" but the attorney general did n't criticize the hecklers			1
in fact , he praised them			0
" there will be a tendency on the part of some to condemn what we just saw , but we should not , " @entity109 said			2
" what we saw there was a genuine expression of concern and involvement			0
and it is through that level of involvement , that level of concern and i hope a level of perseverance and commitment , that change ultimately will come			0
and so let me be clear , let me be clear , i ai n't mad atcha , all right ? " complete coverage of what 's happening in @entity58 @entity0 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			0
