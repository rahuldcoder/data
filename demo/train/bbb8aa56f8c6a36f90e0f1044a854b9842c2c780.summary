-- three state attorneys general were scheduled to meet with @entity3 representatives to begin negotiations toward eliminating advertisements from the site for prostitution and other suspected illegal sexual activities			1
@entity9 is suspected of killing a 25 - year - old masseuse he met through @entity3 at a @entity12 hotel			1
state attorneys general from @entity14 , @entity15 , and @entity16 were to represent a group of state attorneys general in a meeting tuesday in @entity20 with representatives of the web site			1
@entity14 attorney general @entity23 said his office found several ads offering and seeking prostitution on @entity3 pages for the @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity32 / @entity31 , and @entity33 areas			1
" @entity3 is allowing advertisements for illegal activities like prostitution on its site , " @entity23 said a statement			1
" @entity3 ceo @entity42 expressed optimism toward the goal of reducing illegal activity on the site but stopped short of discussing the removal of the " erotic services " section			2
" @entity3 looks forward to meeting with the attorneys general , and anticipates making further progress toward the common goal of eliminating illegal activity from @entity3 , while preserving its full utility and benefit for tens of millions of law - abiding @entity57 who value and depend on @entity3 's free local community services in their everyday lives , " @entity42 said in a statement			1
the site 's erotic services section was thrust into the national spotlight following the arrest last month of @entity9 , who is suspected of killing a 25 - year - old masseuse he met through @entity3 at a @entity12 hotel			1
@entity9 , a 22 - year - old medical student at @entity67 , was charged with murder , unlawful possession of a firearm , and kidnapping			0
he is also suspected of attacks on two other escorts at hotels			0
however , even before the so - called " @entity3 killing , " the site had worked with a group of 40 attorneys general to create new measures on the site designed to thwart ads for prostitution and other illegal sexual activities			1
@entity3 requires anyone posting ads to the erotic services section to submit an operational phone number and credit card , the site announced last year			2
but those measures do n't do enough to stem prostitution , according to a federal lawsuit filed in march against @entity3 by the sheriff of @entity15 ' @entity92 , alleging that the @entity95 's largest classifieds publication is " facilitating prostitution			2
" sheriff @entity96 asked the court to force @entity3 to remove the erotic services section and for $ 100,000 in compensation for the man - hours the county paid police to investigate alleged criminal services being advertised on the site			2
@entity42 suggested at the time that the suit was a waste of time , saying that " @entity3 can not be held liable , as a matter of clear federal law , for content submitted to the site by our users			2
" @entity3 announced later that month that ads for such services were down 90 percent to 95 percent during the past 12 months on @entity3 sites that serve five major @entity57 cities			0
however , many @entity0 readers suggested that the reduction was due to the ads being relabeled and moved to another section			0
while some portray @entity3 as the world 's largest bordello , workers in the sex trade say the site helps reduce the risk of violence prostitutes often face			0
" @entity3 is important to helping us avoid violence , " a 35 - year - old sex worker in @entity128 told @entity0 last month before the murder in @entity12 occurred			0
" @entity3 is a way to filter out that kind of person ... and with @entity3 there is no need for pimps			0
