she had gathered the paper as fuel for cooking , authorities said			2
even though @entity25 's lawyer said no one actually saw the girl burning the papers , the neighbor went to @entity18 -- the neighborhood cleric -- with the bags for safekeeping as evidence			1
@entity18 was n't certain that simply burning pages with texts from the @entity21 would be enough to convict @entity25 on blasphemy charges , said @entity51 , the investigating officer in the case			1
so , the imam added two pages from the holy book itself to the bag to bolster the case , @entity51 said			1
police arrested @entity18 on saturday after three witnesses told a judge about the imam 's actions			2
he was sent to jail for 14 days , accused of evidence tampering			2
@entity18 has denied the allegation , authorities said			2
@entity16 , the police chief , drew a distinction between the accusations against the two , saying @entity25 is a simple - minded minor , while the imam is highly educated in religious studies and indulged in the act of blasphemy @entity75 insulting @entity77 provokes widespread and immediate reaction in @entity1 , a predominantly @entity5 nation			1

during a tense hearing saturday , @entity5 lawyers demanding that @entity25 remain in jail got into a shouting match with the judge			1
