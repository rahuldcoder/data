-- one thing @entity3 people should not have to worry about is money			1
oil money is paying for @entity3 's growth but it is also the main cause of rising prices the kingdom is awash in cash which keeps pouring into the world 's largest oil producer as prices rise			1
last year alone , @entity3 is estimated to have raked in about $ 200 billion from oil			1
it is this influx of money which is paying for @entity3 's economic growth -- but it is also the main cause of rising prices across the country			2
" there is no free lunch			0
if you want to grow at that base , you have to swallow a price every once in a while in the form of high inflation , " said @entity24 , ceo of investment bank , @entity25			2
@entity3 people are certainly paying the price			2
inflation is currently running at 9.6 percent -- a 30 - year high			1
at the beginning of the year , rental costs went up nearly 17 percent			2
in march , the cost of fuel and water increased almost 16 percent and other everyday staples also saw double digit gains			1
the kingdom 's business community is also concerned about the adverse effects of inflation			0
a recent survey of @entity3 's business confidence by financial services company , @entity47 , found that while confidence remains robust , over half of respondents were concerned that inflation would lead to rising business costs			1
prices in the kingdom will continue their upward trend , according to the analysts at @entity47			0
what 's more , there is not much the @entity3 government can do to combat it			1
the riyal , like many other @entity62 currencies , is pegged to the @entity64 dollar and while the @entity62 is booming , the @entity64 is heading towards recession			0
as the economic fortunes of the two countries continue to diverge it is hard to see what can be done to combat inflation			0
the main problem is that whenever the @entity73 cuts interest rates , like it did this week , the kingdom must follow suit			0
in a booming economy like @entity3 's , low interest rates push prices through the roof			0
the government is studying whether remedies like a minimum wage could ease the pain but some in the kingdom , like @entity24 , say there is no quick solution			1
" honestly , i do n't ' think there is an answer for such a question			0
i do n't think there is a magical formula that could fix this issue , " he told @entity0			0

last year , @entity3 *brought* in around $ 200 billion from oil
the huge profits are fueling growth but inflation is at a 30 year high
food and water costs have *rocketed* by 16 percent
the @entity3 government is looking at remedies like a minimum wage
