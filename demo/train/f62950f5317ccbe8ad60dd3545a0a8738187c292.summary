@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's @entity3 has upheld a ruling that will decriminalize abortions in cases of rape			1
tuesday 's ruling will ease what has been a very strict interpretation of the tough anti-abortion laws on the books			0
" the statute has been on the books more than 80 years			2
however , there were contradictory interpretations by lower courts throughout the country , and these interpretations , in some cases , said that women who were raped are only permitted an abortion if they are mentally challenged or demented , which is what the statute says , " said @entity15 of the @entity16			1
" the court made a clarification about this issue and said that in all cases in which there was rape there exists the right to an abortion			1
" abortion is illegal in @entity1			1
as interpreted , in addition to cases of mental incapacity , the law only permitted abortions in some instances in which the mother 's life was at risk			2
the original case involved a 15 - year - old girl who became pregnant after being raped by her stepfather			1
a lower court ruled in march 2010 that an abortion was permissible in cases of rape , but that decision was appealed to the nation 's highest court			1
in its ruling , the @entity3 clarified that @entity1 's @entity59 and human rights treaties would not allow such a prohibition in cases of rape			1
" on the contrary , they forbid punishing all victims of rape in accordance to the principles of equality , personal dignity , and legality , " the country 's center for judicial information reported			0
the ruling also specified that judicial authorization is not needed before performing an abortion			2
the only necessary declaration is the patient 's statement that she was raped , the court ruled			0
despite the country 's tough anti-abortion laws , the health ministry estimates that some 460,000 abortions are performed each year in @entity1			1
the ministry estimated that about 100 women die each year because the procedures were not carried out with the required medical expertise			0
@entity89 , a member of an @entity1 pro-life group , said despite the ruling , there are other options besides abortion			1
" a woman who has difficulties must have assistance			0
legal , medical , psychological assistance			0
we have to promote the adoption system			0
there are thousands of couples in @entity1 without children and who ca n't have children			2
it is a much more humane situation than killing , " he said			0
the head of @entity1 's bishops conference , monsignor @entity108 , said he was surprised to hear of the court 's decision			2
" abortion is the suppression of an innocent life , and there does not exist any motive or reason that justifies the elimination of an innocent life , not even the unfortunate case of a rape , " he said			0
