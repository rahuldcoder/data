@entity0 -- federal health officials say 14 people in six states have been sickened by the same strain of @entity6 over the past couple of months			1
according to @entity9 spokeswoman @entity8 , 14 cases of @entity13 toxin - producing escherichia coli 0145 infection with the same dna fingerprint have been identified in six states			1
" their illness onsets range from april 15 to may 12 , " she said , adding that the most recent case was reported june 4			1
" three ill persons have been hospitalized			2
one death has been reported in @entity21			1
" cases have been reported in @entity23 ( 2 ) , @entity24 ( 1 ) , @entity25 ( 1 ) , @entity26 ( 5 ) , @entity21 ( 4 ) and @entity27 ( 1 ) , according to the @entity9			1
@entity21 health officials would confirm only that one child died and three adults were sickened in the @entity32 area			1
@entity1 affiliate @entity33 reported that the child was 21 - month - old @entity35 , who fought the infection for weeks at a local hospital			1
feds speed up @entity6 investigation procedures @entity26 is reporting five cases , the most in one state			1
" four of five are female , and their ages range from 18 to 52 , with a median of 34			2
illness onsets range from ( april 15 - 28 ) ; one case was hospitalized overnight for this illness , and no cases have died , " said @entity45 , deputy director of communications for the @entity26 @entity46			1
the cases in @entity26 have been mild , according to dr. j. @entity52 , who heads the @entity53 within the @entity26 @entity46			1
he said thursday , " i do n't think there 's need for great concern			2
i think awareness , yes , concern , no. we have outbreaks of various diarrheal diseases quite frequently			2
" neither of the @entity64 was hospitalized ; both have recovered , the state 's @entity46 said in a news release			1
according to the @entity9 , the most common strain is @entity68			2
the strain in this outbreak is 0145			2
" as whole , the @entity73 serogroup is less likely to cause severe illness than @entity68 , " it said			2
" however , some @entity77 ( @entity13 toxin - producing @entity6 ) serogroups can cause the most severe manifestations of @entity81 illness			2
" @entity82 said many clinical laboratories do not regularly test for this particular strain of @entity6			0
however , the @entity86 strain is one of six additional strains for which the @entity89 @entity91 's @entity90 has begun testing for in ground beef			0
the cause of the outbreak is unknown , and the investigation is ongoing on the federal and local levels			1
infectious disease investigators will interview the victims to determine what exposures they have in common			0
the @entity9 says it 's looking at both food and non-food exposures as a source of the outbreak			0
however , @entity21 health officials say they suspect that food may be to blame , according to a statement from the state 's @entity109 and @entity111			1
" people usually get sick from @entity81 2 - 8 days ( average of 3 - 4 days ) after swallowing the organism , " @entity82 said in a statement			0
she added that most people infected with the 0145 strain develop diarrhea ( usually watery and often bloody ) and abdominal cramps			0
" most illnesses resolve on their own within seven days , but sometimes the symptoms can last longer and can be more severe			0
" so investigators are dependent on people accurately remembering what they ate or came into contact with before they got sick			0
food such as meat and poultry but also fruit and vegetables is often the source of e. coli infections			0
however , unpasteurized or raw milk , water that has not been disinfected , contact with cattle or contact with the feces of infected people are other sources of infections			0
young children , pregnant women , the elderly and people who have weakened immune systems ( like cancer or @entity151 patients ) are at greater risk for severe illness and death			0
the best way to avoid getting sick is by washing hands frequently when preparing food as well as avoiding cross-contamination of food preparation areas by washing cutting boards , counters and utensils with hot , soapy water			0
properly washing hands after using the bathroom and after coming into contact with animals or being in their environments -- anywhere there may be traces of feces , where the bacteria could be lurking -- also helps			0
cooking meats thoroughly to at least @entity175 or @entity176 kills the bacteria and prevents infection as well			0
using a meat thermometer will most accurately help you determine that the food is thoroughly cooked			0
