-- the @entity2 's oldest nuclear aircraft carrier has given a piece of itself to one of the younger carriers in the fleet			1
@entity8 @entity7 said this week that its workers had transferred an anchor from the @entity11 ( @entity12 - 65 ) , the @entity2 's first and oldest nuclear carrier , to the @entity14 ( @entity12 - 72 ) , a nimitz - class carrier launched in 1988			1
the @entity11 , which was launched in 1960 , was inactivated in 2012 and is scheduled to be decommissioned in 2016			0
once its nuclear fuel and reactors are removed , it will be cut up for scrap			1
it has been at the @entity22 shipyard for the de-fueling process			0
the @entity24 is in the same shipyard for what is called a refueling and complex overhaul			2
" during this multi-year process , every inch of the carrier is updated or refurbished , including its two massive anchors , " the shipyard said in a statement			0
when it was found that one of the @entity24 's 30 - ton anchors needed to be replaced , crews turned to the @entity11 , which had an exact match that would have been headed to the scrap heap with the rest of the five - decade - old ship			1
" with this anchor , both ships will be linked , and @entity14 will carry @entity11 's spirit as it returns to the fleet , " @entity42 , @entity7 ' vice president of in - service aircraft carrier programs , said in a statement			1
that anchor move may assuage some @entity2 enthusiasts , who have pushed for a new @entity2 vessel to carry the name enterprise once the current ship finally leaves the fleet			0
the carrier now docked in @entity57 is the eighth @entity59 warship to carry the @entity11 name			2
the @entity61 , the service 's official list of ships , shows the @entity11 name assigned to hull number @entity12 , a proposed aircraft carrier yet to be authorized or funded by @entity68			1
the @entity24 's overhaul is expected to be complete in 2016 , when the ship is scheduled to head out for sea trials , according to a shipyard statement			2
meanwhile , the @entity11 will be towed down the @entity73 and all the way around the tip of @entity76 and up the @entity77 , with a final destination of @entity79 , @entity80			0
there its nuclear reactor will be removed and buried at a disposal site on the former @entity84 nuclear production complex on the @entity85 .			0
