-- @entity2 's accountant must be grinning from ear to ear after the @entity6 's incredible winning streak last year			1
but the world no. 3 is n't getting carried away			1
" like someone said : ' money is only paper , ' right ? it 's not really going to make you much more happy or extremely sad if you lose a bit , " @entity2 says			1
easy to say , perhaps , after netting a cool $ 20 million in prize money in 2013			2
but it 's not the fiscal peaks that have helped shape the 37 - year - old 's apparently easy - going attitude to money as much as one spectacular loss			1
@entity2 was a victim of the convicted fraudster @entity22 and reportedly lost several million dollars in the @entity24 's $ 7 billion @entity23 , which was uncovered in 2009			1
the @entity6 said it was n't so much the scale of the losses but rather the way in which the money went			1
" it was probably more about , you know , how you lose something when you think something is a safe investment when it turns out it ( is n't ) , " @entity2 told @entity0 's @entity30			2
" that 's got to be more disappointing than taking it to the casino -- you lose , but you know what the risks are			0
that was probably more what upset me the most about the whole thing			0
" i guess i was in a position where i can make up for it in a pretty short space of time			0
other people would n't be so lucky			0
for me , it 's like a closed chapter			0
i moved on long ago , but i keep getting reminded of it now and again , " he says , before breaking into a smile			0
getting up and down he can afford to smile after becoming the first golfer to win both the @entity59 's @entity58 and the @entity60 to @entity61 in the same season			1
@entity2 claimed the $ 10 million prize for winning the @entity58 after winning the season - ending @entity64 at @entity66 's @entity65 in september before storming to a six - stroke victory in the @entity68 in @entity61 eight weeks later			1
it was an unprecedented end to a season which saw @entity2 return to golf 's top table after recovering from a debilitating and prolonged slump			1
after winning golf 's " fifth major , " @entity74 at @entity75 in may 2009 , @entity2 looked set to join the sport 's elite with strong showings at the @entity80 ( ninth place ) and the @entity82 ( tied sixth ) later that season			1
a tie for third in the @entity86 at @entity87 the following year only seemed to confirm his status as a serious contender for a major title			1
but things fell apart in the second half of 2010 before completely unraveling in 2011 with a succession of missed cuts and only one top 10 finish all year			2
as if the loss of form was n't sickening enough , @entity2 then picked up a waterborne parasite on holiday in november 2011 which led to a bout of viral pneumonia			1
" he lost what we call the ground force because physically he was poorly , " says @entity102 , @entity2 's long - time swing coach			1
" if you lose your physical strength you lose all your control			0
" that lack of power sent @entity2 tumbling down the rankings from a career high of world no. 5 in 2009 to 230th			1
it was n't the first time @entity2 had gone from golden boy to nowhere man			2
a year after clinching his maiden @entity60 victory in 2001 ( at the now defunct @entity120 ) the @entity6 missed 14 cuts and won just over â ‚ ¬ 40,000 ( $ 55,000 )			1
" it was big slump			2
they were really tough times , " he recalls			0
" i was really lost with my game , i lost my confidence			2
" on course for recovery the second , more recent reverse was less to do with any technical deficiencies than with " frustrations , " he says at not being able to compete like he used to			0
" the most important thing i did with my old sport psychologist ( @entity136 ) was to start working on the long - term planning			2
when you are down and out , it 's so easy ( to go for ) short - term solutions , " @entity2 said			1
" the quick fixes do n't work			0
i think you 've got to put a plan in place and work towards it -- slow but steady progress -- and eventually you will get to the point where you want to get			0
" with a new physical and psychological regime in place , @entity2 started to see the green shoots of recovery with victory at the @entity152 in november 2012			2
" that was hugely important , especially the way i won it because i held the lead for most of the weekend and then dropped back on sunday and i managed to come back on the back nine			0
that was huge for the confidence ... after three - and - a - half years without a win			1
" @entity2 's season - ending victories may have grabbed all the headlines but his comeback year also included his best - ever performance at a major championship -- second to @entity165 in the @entity86 at @entity166 -- backed up by a third - place finish at the @entity82			1
a major breakthrough ? so can he break his duck in 2014 and become @entity6 's first major winner ? " if my game is in good shape and it 's my week , i definitely think so , " he says			1
@entity102 can also see his pupil of 13 years clinching that elusive prize			0
" he 's a complex person , " says @entity102			0
" one day he 's up , the next day he 's down			0
when he 's up , he 's very , very good , but when he 's down , you know ... but that 's what the best players are like			0
" i would think @entity2 is one of a few players who can win tournaments on ball striking alone			1
he 's certainly got the game			0
there are quite a few players who deserve to win majors , but unfortunately you have to win them			2
" @entity2 will get his first chance at @entity189 in april , but before that will be lining up at @entity191 , @entity192 for the @entity193 on february 19 -- a tournament that he won in 2007			2
whatever happens this coming week and for the rest of the season , @entity2 appears well equipped to deal with what comes his way			1
" you know , you are going to have your ups and downs			0
i might have had two ( downs ) that were deeper than most , but the belief never went away			0
" what we learn is to never give up			0
if you keep at it , if you keep the belief , you can achieve great things			0
