-- @entity2 's decision to allow the uploading and sharing of extreme / graphic content -- including beheadings -- makes no sense in a conventional media setting			1
most western media outlets operate under regulatory codes that make the screening or publishing of such material unthinkable -- not least because their audience might include children			0
inevitably the " protection of children " argument will be rehearsed in response to @entity2 's decision , which seems almost designed to court negative commentary			1

internet content is of course regulated and controlled but not very effectively so			0
the decision may also offer the genuinely weird and definitively 21st century prospect of @entity32 and @entity34 security services using @entity2 to track global viewing patterns of beheading videos			1

what should @entity2 users take from the site 's decision that it is ok to screen and view the brutal beheading of a woman in @entity54 -- provided that the commentary clearly does n't glorify the act and that any unsuitable comments are moderated / blocked ? is it only that brutal violence is part of life and we have the right to make the obvious comments about that fact			1
as @entity2 's statement says : " @entity2 has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences , particularly when they 're connected to controversial events on the ground , such as human rights abuses , acts of terrorism and other violent events			1
" people share videos of these events on @entity2 to condemn them			1
if they were being celebrated , or the actions in them encouraged , our approach would be different			0
" apart from an increased volume of utterly banal denunciations of the act ( only the " right " kinds of statements will be allowed ) what could the screening of such events lead to ? people who feel that violence is wrong will say so , people who make @entity93 © or bad - taste jokes will make them , and so the chatter will go on			0
in 2003 , the @entity34 military clamped - down on active service personnel 's trading of explicit smart - phone images of the aftermath of suicide bombings in @entity102			2
so , the potential cultural power of such images can be recognised by liberals , conservatives , and bodies such as the @entity108 alike -- even if they fundamentally disagree about what that power is			0
equally , it 's not safe to accept the treatment of such footage as a set of taboo " magic objects , " which can never be seen because they are inherently so dangerous in their ability to corrupt the majority and the minors			0
such anxieties are frequently directed at unspecified ( ie : less educated than " us " -- less middle - class ) mass audiences and are another means of closing down challenge or debate			2
what is at stake here does seem to be a realignment of sadly well - known patterns			0
these are simply thrown into sharp relief by the specifics of the examples that are being spoken about today			0
@entity2 kills search privacy setting ' laughably inconsistent ' @entity2 sees it as a legitimate service to allow its audience to see a woman being brutally killed and then host discussion of that content , but will not allow its users to see exposed breasts -- for fear of causing offense			1
is it possible for @entity2 to argue that there is nothing to debate in the representation of women 's bodies ? or that they are not part of people 's experience ? this is -- at best -- laughably inconsistent			1
one of the primary reasons for carrying out beheadings in public or for perpetrators to video a violent act is to send the clear message to its audience : this is what our " law " or " power " , or violence can do to you			2
so , the re-showing of such footage on @entity2 is actively collusive with those actions			0
it disseminates the fear and intimidation intended in the act			0
asserting that @entity2 users can respond to footage of a woman 's brutal murder by decrying it , sidesteps that issue			2
users could just as well decry violence against women without seeing this act			0
but fewer of them may do so			0
if @entity2 really was interested in public debate , it would have established a real and carefully constructed , open forum in which this decision could be debated -- as well as other issues about its policies , operation and inconsistent stances			1
what @entity2 is interested in , is generating more traffic through its platform and it is doing so from within a pretty inconsistent , narrowly male and conservative image of the world and of what should be discussed within it			1
how different is that from many traditional media organizations of the 19th and 20th centuries ? read more : twitter cracks down on abusive tweets the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity2 has lifted a ban *imposed* in may on the uploading and sharing of violent videos
but the social media site 's rules means images of *breastfeeding* *mothers* may be removed
@entity2 is trying to generate traffic from a narrow image of the world , @entity207 says
if the site wanted public debate , it would have opened discussion of the change , he says
