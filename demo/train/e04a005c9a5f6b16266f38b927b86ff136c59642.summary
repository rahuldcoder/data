@entity0 , @entity1 -- the last time anyone saw @entity5 alive , he was near the stern of the @entity7 , helping passengers into rescue boats			1
but the 33 - year - old waiter from @entity11 never escaped the doomed cruise ship			1
and he 's the only victim of the 2012 shipwreck whose remains have n't been found			1
investigators hope that could change soon			1
a complicated operation to refloat the ship gives them a chance to begin a new search for @entity5			1
by midday monday , the ship was floating again , @entity22 ceo @entity21 said			1
salvage crews began the arduous task of refloating the ship on monday morning so they can move it to the @entity1 port of @entity26 to be dismantled			1
it 's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off @entity1 's @entity0 with more than 4,200 passengers aboard , killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention			1
and it 's been 10 months since salvage teams rolled the 114,000 - ton vessel off the rocks in one of the most complex shipwreck recovery efforts ever undertaken			0
but there 's still more work to be done			0
" we are not at the end , but we are at a critical moment , " @entity0 mayor @entity40 told reporters			0
for 10 months , engineers have been hard at work , attaching metal boxes to either side of the ship			2
after draining water from the boxes , they had to pump compressed air into its place to get the ship to float			2
it was a dangerous and tricky procedure			0
the ship is rotting , and there 's a real risk the bottom of it could give way			2
by lunchtime monday , the ship had been moved 20 meters ( about 66 feet ) as part of an initial 30 - meter ( 98 - feet ) shift to the east			2
the shift dramatically changed the appearance of the wreck from land			0
after 30 meters , the ship will be anchored and operations will cease for monday			2
on tuesday , five steel hollow boxes , or sponsons , will be lowered , and divers will begin attaching more chains and cables to help reinforce the bottom of the boat			0
once that 's done they 'll raise the ship deck by deck , clearing any debris along the way			2
after the ship is completely floated , a convoy of 10 boats will then begin a potentially treacherous journey			2
the ship will be towed -- slowly and carefully -- 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) to @entity26			2
@entity1 environment minister @entity84 told the media that the operation marked the closure of a dark moment in @entity1			0
he said it would have been too dangerous to leave the @entity7 in the same position for another year			1
" we could have dismantled the @entity92 in situ , but they chose to take the more expensive , riskier route to tow it away to save the environment of @entity0 , " @entity84 said			0
officials said it 's likely the towing process wo n't start for days due to port restrictions			0
it will take five to six days for the ship to reach @entity26 , officials said			1
@entity21 , the ceo , called the operation " the most daunting salvage ever attempted on a ship of its size			1
" he added that the cost of the project has already exceeded 1 billion euros -- not including the refloat , the anticipated transport to @entity26 or the dismantling			0
since the wreck two years ago , 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture , dishes , food , personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed			0
while salvage crews continue efforts to deal with the wreckage , @entity92 , the ship 's captain , is on trial on charges of manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board			0
search teams thought they had found @entity5 's remains in october			1
but the body divers found turned out to be that of @entity139 , a @entity140 who was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17 - year - old daughter , who survived			1
in a @entity146 post , brother @entity144 said he was watching the latest salvage operation live online , since he could n't make it to @entity0			0
" i strongly believe that they will find the body of my dear brother , " he said			0
nine things to know about the plan to salvage the @entity7 journalist @entity154 reported from @entity0			1
@entity2 's @entity155 reported from @entity156 , and @entity2 's @entity157 reported from @entity158 .			0

the ship is now floating again , the @entity22 ceo says
the @entity7 cruise ship ran aground and tipped in *january* 2012 , killing 32 people
officials hope to find the remains of waiter @entity5 , only victim not found
