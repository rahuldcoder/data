-- federal aid helped many cash - strapped @entity3 keep a roof over their heads during the prolonged economic slump , but the number of people living a step away from the streets has grown sharply , researchers reported wednesday			1
the estimated @entity3 homeless population dipped about 1 % between 2009 and 2011 despite the lingering effects of the 2007 - 2009 recession , the @entity13 - based @entity12 concluded			1
about $ 1.5 billion from the 2009 economic stimulus measure went toward rental assistance and programs steering recently evicted people toward new housing , " and it seems likely that that has worked , " said @entity24 , president of the @entity25			1
nevertheless , the homeless population went up in 24 states during the past two years , the @entity13 - based researchers found			1
and the number of people who have had to move in with friends or relatives -- often a last stop before the street -- is up as well , according to wednesday 's report			2
the @entity12 , the educational arm of @entity37 's organization , put the number of @entity3 living on the streets or in shelters at just over 636,000 in 2011			1
that 's down about 6,000 from the group 's 2009 estimate			0
the figure is based on reports and street counts from state and local agencies that receive federal housing funds			2
@entity37 said the stimulus money , coupled with pre-recession federal programs aimed at veterans and the chronically ill , have kept that figure down even as the @entity3 economy saw its worst downturn since the 1930s			1
but that money is drying up now that the @entity59 administration , @entity60 and the states are grappling with budget issues fueled by the recession			2
" just like all domestic discretionary spending , it 's vulnerable at the moment because of the deficit , " @entity37 said			0
states have already been cutting services , " so again , it 's notable that these are still working			0
" the report found the effects of the recession keep cascading downward more than two years after its official end in mid- 2009			0
more than 4 million homes have been lost to foreclosure since 2007 , according to the online marketer @entity78			0
those foreclosures have driven many ex-homeowners into the rental market , driving up rents and pushing some of the working poor to move in with family , friends or other acquaintances			0
that " doubled - up " population grew by about 800,000 people between 2009 and 2010 , the last year data was available , the @entity12 report concluded			1
about 6.8 million were in combined households in 2010 , a more than 50 % increase from 2005 , researchers found			0
" the most common previous address for homeless people is that they were doubled up with someone else , " @entity37 said			1
the new figures are " not a good sign			1
it means we 've got potentially a lot of people moving toward homelessness			0
" the number of low - income households that spend more than half their income on rent grew by 300,000 in 2009 , to 6.2 million			0
that 's about three - quarters of poor renters , the @entity12 study found			0
but the figures showed slight declines among nearly all categories examined , including a more than 10 % decline in the number of unemployed veterans and about a 3 % dip in the ranks of the chronically homeless -- people with disabilities like severe mental illness or addiction that result in repeated or extended stays on the street .			2

the estimated @entity3 homeless population has remained basically flat , researchers say
but a rise in people sharing housing is " not a good sign , " an *advocate* says
about $ 1.5 billion in stimulus money helped keep people in homes , she says
