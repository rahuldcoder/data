-- @entity1 had @entity3 , @entity2 had @entity4 , @entity5 had @entity6 ; iconic heroes have iconic sidekicks who keep their main man sane and humanized , while providing the audience with a proxy			0
but whereas the @entity13 only had one @entity14 , " @entity15 " from 50 - year - old @entity17 series " @entity23 " goes through a lot of " companions " -- so much so that new arrivals are met with fan anticipation and anxiety			1
enter @entity24 , the 26 - year - old actress who officially steps into the role of sci - fi sidekick on the popular @entity29 show 's @entity27			1
known to @entity31 audiences from the april 2012 @entity34 miniseries " titanic , " and for a brief role in 2010 's " captain america : the @entity38 , " she joins " @entity23 " as @entity39 , a companion to @entity15 , a mysterious , human - looking " @entity41			1
" played by @entity42 , he journeys through " @entity50 " in his aptly - named ship , the tardis -- which looks like a blue @entity17 police call box on the outside , and is as iconographic a vehicle as the @entity47 , @entity48 or @entity49			1
launched in 1963 , change and evolution is part of the show 's dna			2
when a lead actor steps down , the doctor essentially dies and is regenerated into a new body , but as the same character with a new actor portraying him			1
@entity42 is the 11th to do so			1
however , over five decades , more than the 30 companions have been unique characters with their own back - story			2
the doctor invites them on adventures across the " time vortex " to face monsters and save worlds			2
as they retire or die , fresh ones are needed to keep the him company			0
although she is only the latest of companions , @entity74 's debut comes during a unique moment during " @entity23			1
" gracing the covers of @entity79 and @entity80 as a fan favorite , garnering a cover mention in " @entity83 " as a best fall show , ranking as @entity86 ' most downloaded tv show in the @entity31 , packing the house at @entity88 , @entity74 arrives as the global brand has become a bona fide hit in @entity31 -- and immediately following the death of popular predecessors @entity93 and @entity94 ( played by @entity95 and @entity96 ) , @entity42 's first companions			1
@entity74 played a surprise role in last september 's season premiere -- as @entity101 , a different character from @entity103 , but one connected to her -- and takes on full companion duties in " @entity105 " @entity27 episode , airing december 25 at 9 p.m. et. a mysterious woman with a secret , @entity98 is a feisty , flirty foil to a grief - stricken , apathetic doctor			1
" we see him having just lost the @entity112 , and he 's not in a great place , " said @entity42			1
" he 's lost his mojo a bit , and his sense of adventure , and i think this season certainly looks at him rediscovering that fire with @entity98			2
" @entity42 added he is excited for fans to see the developing chemistry between him and @entity74 , as well as the " real intrigue " behind the mystery of @entity98 's identity			1
and just as the nature of " @entity23 " is change , @entity42 said fans will also embrace @entity129			1
for her part , @entity24 has already embraced her role as a companion			1
during a recent interview at @entity29 's @entity138 offices , she offered insight about her character and her relationship with the doctor , and weighed in on @entity98 's @entity144 © obsession , driving a spaceship , her @entity135 moment and @entity27 traditions			1
can you share a moment when you felt the enormity of stepping into this popular world ? you see " it " everywhere and you 're used to it , like i was used to seeing @entity42 's face all over the place			1
but , when i was auditioning , being sat on the @entity156 and you see the posters , and it was always like he was pointing at me			0
... ( but ) there 's not very much time to analyze as you go			2
it is only now that i feel like i 've just been playing with all my mates for the last couple of months , and then suddenly , i 'm like , " but people are going to see this , " you know ? what would you like to add to the legacy of the show as @entity101 / @entity98 ? i like that it 's not plain sailing			1
like ( executive producer @entity174 ) was saying , it 's not very interesting if you come in and it 's like this friendship straight away			2
he 's been very clever in creating a mystery , because , no matter what , it 's always going to be hard to bring in somebody else into the show , when @entity42 , @entity95 and @entity96 started out together , and you 're used to seeing them on screen together			1
how would you define your character 's relationship with @entity15 ? i like that she holds her own			2
you know , the doctor 's this amazing man , and she 's like , " you know , cool			1
i think you 're amazing , but so am @entity194 " so , it 's a nice double act			2
has @entity95 offered advice on joining the show ? she 's been really supportive			2
... she came to the screening in @entity198 with @entity42 , and when @entity101 was on screen , she texted me saying it was great			1
( @entity201 ) from interviews i 've seen of @entity95 , she was saying she did n't want to , because she wanted me to have my own experience			0
i did want to be like , " what do i need to know ? tell me everything ! " but she 's been really cool about it			2
there was never a realized romance between the doctor and @entity211 , but your character gets flirtatious straight away , right ? it 's been interesting how it 's changed @entity210			1
there is a natural bounce between them , and a flirtation , and attraction			0
but , again , they 've always got this friction because they 're a bit magnetic and drawn to each other , but she ca n't quite figure him out			0
he 's got loads of secrets and he 's always looking at her , trying to figure her out			2
can you tell me about the first meeting between you and @entity42 ? he 's with the same agency as me , so my agent said , " you 're going to be reading with @entity42 and he 's lovely			1
he 'll take care of you			0
" i walked into the room and he 's just like , " @entity240 , " and gave me a big hug			2
he really helped me out in the audition			0
i 've read with other actors in auditions before , but @entity42 really got involved so it was like we were both auditioning together almost			1
this is an iconic franchise , but are there other big franchises you 'd want to step into ? totally ! i 'd love to be a @entity135			0
i did have my @entity135 moment -- well , what i thought was going to be , but it was very much a " @entity23 " version			1
like being on the back of a motorbike , but then we 've got the goggles and the hat , so it was like " @entity23 's " take on @entity261			1
have you played with any cool sci - fi gadgets on the show , like the tardis ? there are certain parts of the tardis which i love			0
we 've got these new kind - of rolly balls , which is my favorite			0
but my character got to drive the tardis at one point ! in the long list of " @entity23 " monsters , what 's your favorite ? the @entity275			1
it 's the concept ( that they only move when you are n't looking at them )			0
but there 's one at the end of this season -- it 's a new monster , and i 'd say you have to wait and see that			0
that one is my favorite , so far			0
one of the things we know about your character is her love of @entity144 ©			0
have you tried making one ? i had to be baking one in a scene recently			0
so i got the @entity295 up and tried to figure out exactly how to do it , take it kind of really seriously to make sure i 've got , like , the whisking right			0
but maybe that 's what i should do over @entity27			0
is it odd returning to a " normal " world after living in @entity15 's ? " this " life is so exciting on a daily basis			0
everything 's so dramatic every day , and it 's the end of the world every week			0
you 're either running or there 's a snow machine or rain machine , or you 're in a harness and you 're on wires			0
... on an off day , i find that i get bored quickly , like , " where 's the @entity313 ? " the " @entity318 " is something of a tradition -- do you have others you 'll keep ? there are 13 of my family going to a cottage , so we 'll be there watching			0
it 's one of my grandmum 's favorite shows , so it 's big for her			0
but normally i get home from @entity330 and i have n't seen my family for a little while , and me and my mum always wrap the presents the night before with a glass of @entity334 's			0
that 's my favorite tradition at @entity337			0
what did your grandmother say when she learned you got this role ? i auditioned for @entity211 's best mate in it , and was pretty close to getting the part , and my grandma was absolutely devastated i did n't			2
so , we came back around , and i do n't think she can believe it , actually			0
it is quite surreal for her , and she 's quite looking forward to meeting @entity352 what do you anticipate that encounter being like ? my grandma 's going to mess up his hair			0
she 's going to be patting him and hugging him , and @entity42 's going to have really messy hair for the rest of the night .			1
