-- after staging a " vomit as art " performance and facing lackluster sales for her latest album , @entity1 is ready to speak her piece			1
on the " today " show friday , the 27 - year - old singer defended her commitment to the weird and spectacular ( and sometimes the spectacularly weird ) , explaining that she 'd be doing the same outlandish things whether she 'd found " @entity12 " or not			2
" there 's a perception that what i 'm doing is all a big show , and i really truly feel that it 's really just part of who i am			0
every moment of my life is devoted to my music and my fans , and it 's really , truly me , " she said			0
" i 'd just be doing it on the @entity28 , it 'd be the same show , the same act			0
" that act has appeared to take a stumble			2
her newest album , " @entity33 , " reached no. 1 with just 258,000 copies sold upon its release in november			1
her previous album , " @entity39 , " notched the same spot in 2011 with 1.1 million copies snapped up in its first week			2
industry observers are quick to note the caveats here : " @entity39 " did have an @entity47 special attached to it , where fans could buy " born " for 99 cents for a limited period of time			0
and compared with other singers with big releases in the fall of 2013 , @entity1 is still playing in the same league : @entity61 's " @entity60 " pushed 286,000 copies in its first week , according to @entity57 , while @entity59 ' " @entity58 " hit 270,000			1
but album sales have become just a slice of @entity1 's dwindling perception among an ambivalent public			1
her latest effort is a mash - up of high art and pop music that met with mixed reviews from critics who were n't sure what to make of her more avant - garde direction			1
( " as pop , the album is a well - executed and entertaining tour of @entity1 's tried - and - true tricks , " @entity75 said			1
" but as art , it falls short when it comes to one basic function : making an impression			2
" ) and somewhere along the way , @entity1 's usual outrageous behavior -- think meat dresses , arriving at awards shows encased in egg - like structures -- has soured from entertaining to off - putting			2
at the @entity91 music festival last week , @entity1 invited " vomit artist " @entity89 to join her onstage to do what @entity89 does best : swill brightly colored goos and then regurgitate them in the name of art. so while @entity1 sang the " @entity33 " track " @entity97 , " @entity89 participated in the performance by sticking her fingers down her throat and vomiting green and black paint all over the pop star			1
both @entity89 and @entity1 have been accused of everything from crossing a line of general decency to glamorizing eating disorders , which both artists have said was not their intent			2
for her part , @entity89 explained to @entity111 that she came up with the idea of " vomit art " because she " wanted to use my body to create a performance that was about the beauty from inside out			1
i came up with the idea of actually vomiting a rainbow using my body as a tool to create paintings			0
... my performance is not a statement about eating disorders in any way			0
i think the whole bulimia thing -- it 's important for people to know that i 'm not trying to promote it			0
" and on " today " on friday , @entity1 stood behind @entity89 's view of her work			2
" ( the artist ) @entity89 and i know that not everyone 's going to love that performance , but we both really believe in artistic expression and strong identities and i support her and what she does			0
' @entity33 ' is about bringing music and art together in the spirit of creative rebellion , and for us that performance was art in its purest form , " the singer said			1
" ( @entity144 ) does n't matter			0
we do n't make things for any intention in particular other than in the spirit of entertaining the crowd and really for the moment			0
it was meant for a club performance in @entity152 , and it was a great time			0
" @entity1 appeared undaunted by any criticism , explaining that she 's charging ahead and at work writing new music			1
if her appearance at @entity91 is any indication , we can expect the singer to continue pointing her arrow more in the same direction			1
" i refuse to compromise and allow my talents to be monetized to the point that i do n't want to be here anymore , " @entity1 said during a keynote address at the @entity164 festival			1
i will retire from the commercial market if i have to do something other than be myself because if i ca n't be myself in this moment ( then ) everything i have said to my friends since the beginning will be a total lie			0
... no , i 'll be myself till they f * * * ing close the coffin			0

@entity1 has appeared to *struggle* since the release of her album " @entity33 "
album sales were n't as high as her earlier ones
her appearance at @entity91 , which *included* ' vomit art " performance , was criticized
the singer stands by her *decisions* , saying they were made for the sake of art
