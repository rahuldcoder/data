" president @entity47 's talk about reforms does n't mean anything when his security forces are mowing down people who want to talk about them			1
" the government announced a number of measures that apparently addressed protesters ' demands			0
among them are decrees to cut taxes and raise government workers ' salaries by 1,500 @entity3 pounds ( $ 32.60 @entity190 ) a month and pledges to provide more press freedoms , increased job opportunities and curbs on government corruption			0

" but video also emerged of protests in @entity278 , where the government violently suppressed an uprising in 1982			2
and the state news agency reported that an armed gang attacked security forces in the southern city of @entity285 , which " resulted in the deaths of several attackers			1
" @entity288 was posted on @entity289 purporting to show the scene of the shooting			1
it shows hundreds of young men and boys walking down a street , then turning around and running back as gunfire breaks out			0
over the course of the 5 - minute video , they regroup several times and head down the street only to reverse course at each burst of fresh gunfire			1
some of the demonstrators are clumped into groups of about five men each			0
as they approach the camera , the lens reveals their broken cargo -- some eight gunshot victims in all			0
one of them holds his fist aloft , another 's limp arm points downward , jostling as he is carried away			2

" @entity3 today is like a barrel of gunpowder , and may explode at any moment , " @entity344 said			0

" @entity344 's son , @entity358 , said a legal group asked the @entity360 to investigate possible crimes against humanity committed by @entity3 forces			2
the group is the @entity365 for the @entity366			0
because @entity3 is not a " state party to the @entity370 statute , " which established the @entity360 , it ca n't typically act on allegations of crimes in @entity3			2
there are two exceptions , however			0
one would be if the @entity3 authorities were to accept the jurisdiction of the court , and the other would be if the @entity380 were to refer the situation to the court			0
@entity383 said he hopes the @entity380 will act			0
" if not , then i guess we will have to wait until there is a recognized @entity3 transitional government who can sign the @entity370 statute			0
" @entity47 has been president since 2000 , succeeding his father , who ruled @entity3 with an iron fist for nearly 30 years			0

@entity49 was elected to a second term as president in 2007 , with 97 % of the vote			0
when he took office , @entity49 initially loosened some government restrictions on @entity3 's people , but analysts say that he has since slowed -- even reversed -- that move toward political reform			2
@entity49 is an @entity402 , as are many of @entity3 's political elite , while @entity405 make up nearly three quarters of the population			2
the @entity402 faith is an offshoot of @entity410			0
