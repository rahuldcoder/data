@entity0 -- some voters are facing a choice this november : vote or be shamed -- publicly			2
voters in @entity5 received a letter this weekend from the " @entity7 , " which told the recipient whether 11 of their friends and acquaintances had voted in the last three elections and asked a bold question : " @entity14 , your neighbors , and your community knew whether you voted ? " despite the official - looking letterhead , the " @entity7 " is n't a government initiative			1
the mailer came from the conservative @entity22 , which is using public voter rolls to shame or peer pressure voters into casting a vote this election , the @entity20 reported monday			1
and the political group says it will follow up after the election , with plans to send out a new mailer that lists which voters went to the polls on nov. 4			1
" you and your friends , your neighbors , and other people you know will all know who voted and who did not vote , " the group writes in the letter			2
the mailer could have an impact on the crucial @entity43 election in @entity5 next week , where @entity45 @entity44 is looking to unseat @entity47 sen. @entity46 , especially in a midterm elections when voter turnout slumps			1
one recipient of the letter told the @entity20 she was creeped out when she realized she was @entity52 friends with the 11 people listed in the mailer she received			0
it 's not the first time groups have tried to shame voters into heading to the polling booth			0
@entity59 , a conservative group backed by the @entity61 brothers , sent voters in @entity63 a " report card " last year that judged their turnout history at the ballot box -- and their next - door neighbor 's			1
" you are one of the few individuals in your neighborhood that is not a regular voter			0
we 're contacting you and your neighbors today to let folks know who does and who does n't vote " the @entity78 letter reads , according to local @entity80 affiliate @entity79			0
" your neighbors who have voted in every election are concerned about our community 's well being			0
they 're concerned about the future of @entity85 ... are you ? " voters in other states have received similar " report cards			0
" another group , values are vital , sent @entity92 voters a mailer this spring that even graded their attendance record at the ballot box and also shared their neighbors ' voting track record			1
@entity99 groups like @entity100 , the @entity101 and @entity102 have also pressured voters with voting records .			2

the mailer used public records to see who had voted and not voted in recent elections
