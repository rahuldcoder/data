-- there 's no escaping the fact that the @entity6 , with its billion - dollar plan to recreate the human mind inside a supercomputer , sounds like a science fiction nightmare			1
but those involved hope their ambitious goal of simulating the tangle of neurons and synapses that power our thought processes could offer solutions to tackling conditions such as depression , parkinson 's disease and @entity19 's			1
the @entity21 venture is the next step in a long - running program that has already succeeded in using computers to create a virtual replica of part of a rat 's neocortex -- a section of the brain believed to control higher functions such as conscious thought , movement and reasoning			1
scientists at its forerunner , the @entity38 - based @entity36 , have been working since 2005 to feed a computer with vast quantities of data and algorithms produced from studying tiny slivers of rodent gray matter			1
last month they announced a significant advancement when they were able to use their simulator to accurately predict the location of synapses in the neocortex , effectively mapping out the complex electrical brain circuitry through which thoughts travel			1
@entity53 , the @entity54 - born neuroscientist who heads the project , said the breakthrough would have taken " decades , if not centuries " to chart using a real neocortex			1
he said it was proof their concept , dubbed " brain in a box " by @entity61 , would work			2

as its name suggests , they aim to scale up their model to recreate an entire human brain			2
it is a step that will need both a huge increase in funding and access to computers so advanced that they have yet to be built			0
if their current bid for â ‚ ¬ 1 billion ( $ 1.3 billion ) of @entity81 funding over the next 10 years is successful , @entity53 predicts that his computer neuroscientists are a decade away from producing a synthetic mind that could , in theory , talk and interact in the same way humans do			2
his bold claims have inevitably fueled comparisons to doom - laden popular fiction in which conscious machines turn on their creators and wreak havoc			2
the project 's scientists have been referred to as " @entity98 " and their computer likened to " @entity100 , " the virtual intelligence that unleashes a robot war on humanity in the " @entity105 " films			1
@entity106 , a senior computational neuroscientist on the project , laughs at such comparisons			0
he says the computer will primarily become a repository for knowledge about the brain that will allow scientists to conduct experiments without the need to probe inside people 's skulls			1

" right now , we 're in a crisis in neuroscience			0
there 's a lot of wonderful data being gathered but we do n't have a place where we can put those experimental results together and understand their implications			2
" the benefit of having this facility is you have a place to integrate the data into a model where you can test predictions and start to learn principles of how the brain operates			2
" the computing power needed to build the model is phenomenal			2
simply to replicate one of the 10,000 neuron brain cells involved in the rat experiment took the processing capacity usually found in a single laptop			0
to simulate a fully functioning human brain , it would take billions			0
@entity106 says that such computational power -- known as exascale -- will be available by the end of the decade			0
the @entity6 's scientists are hoping to work with supercomputer developers to ensure future machines match their requirements			1
but , even as the team touts its experiments as a possible solution to the brain diseases that affect about two billion people worldwide , they have attracted critics who say their work is far too broad in scope to achieve usable results			0
professor @entity169 , head of the @entity170 at the @entity171 in @entity172 , has been quoted as saying the @entity36 project is " bound to fail			0
" read : how the search for aliens can help sustain life on @entity121 he told @entity0 via email that " progress is being made but there is still a long way to go before we will understand the computational capabilities of cortical circuits			0
" he added : " we are just beginning to appreciate how complex our brains are , far beyond any other device in the known universe			0
" @entity106 said the team hoped it was answering skeptics with its achievements so far			0
" it 's just a matter of keeping on doing it			0
let 's keep improving these tools and open them up so that many scientists are engaged and collaborating and using it as common point to bring the data together , " he said			1
" the only way to address the critics is to keep working , showing the positive results and do the best we can -- and that is starting to happen			0

@entity6 will use supercomputers to mimic tangle of neurons and synapses that power our thoughts
scientists say the simulator could offer new insight into the *treatment* of brain disease like @entity218 's and @entity19 's
" @entity223 " is unlikely to *transform* into sci - fi - style computer bent on world *domination* , scientists say
