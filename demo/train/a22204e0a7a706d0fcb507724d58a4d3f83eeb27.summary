@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's passenger airline industry may still be awaiting full take off but @entity4 has identified the continent as a market ripe with potential			1
the @entity9 company -- one of the world 's biggest airplane manufacturers -- has found its order book filled with an increasing number of @entity16 clients in recent years			0
but with airlines based on the continent still only accounting for a fraction of overall air traffic between @entity1 and the rest of the world , the company 's vice president of @entity20 , @entity17 believes there remains plenty of room for further expansion			1
" right now the @entity16 market for the airlines is quite small , " he says			0
" african airlines only have around 2 % of the total of revenues of the traffic between @entity1 and the rest of the world , so to me the potential is huge , " he adds			1
the latent " potential " that @entity17 refers to is confirmed by industry statistics and future passenger projections			0
according to research conducted by the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) in february 2011 , @entity1 is now the second fastest growing region in the world in terms of commercial aviation , behind @entity46			1
the @entity47 published earlier this month meanwhile reported that @entity48 alone will require at least 542 new aircraft by 2020 to meet rising passenger numbers			0
by providing the technology and expertise to meet these increased capacity requirements , @entity17 believes that @entity4 and the @entity16 airlines they provide for can jointly reap the benefits			2
" we have a lot of customers in @entity1 and this is actually a very exciting period , " he says			2
" the numbers , if everything stays the way it is right now ... without the @entity16 airlines growing faster and the way they should , it would be around 800 airplanes for the next 20 years ( and ) worth around 100 billion dollars , " he adds			2
@entity17 cites airlines such as @entity68 's @entity67 -- which recently purchased two 747 - 8 @entity69 , @entity4 's biggest passenger planes --- , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 as some of the companies striving to meet @entity1 's burgeoning aviation and connectivity needs			1
but while bullish about the potential of these companies in the years to come , he remains wary of the infrastructure , political and technological challenges they must first navigate if they are to fully meet their potential			1
@entity17 cites a lack of trained pilots , poor safety records , @entity16 governments unwilling to open their skies and foreign competitors -- particularly from the @entity91 -- who can undercut the prices of @entity16 airlines , as some of his most pressing concerns			0
yet in spite of these issues @entity17 remains optimistic about what can be achieved if airlines , manufacturers and governments work together for the good of continent as a whole			0
" aviation ... is a machine that will develop the region , " he says			0
if governments and @entity16 airlines can combine their interests and meet these challenges , he adds " they will be able to find growth and development , " across @entity1 , taking full " advantage of this machine			2

@entity1 is one of the fastest growing regions for commercial aviation .
@entity4 's vice president for @entity122 says the continent 's potential is huge .
african airlines face political and technological challenges in fulfilling their full potential .
