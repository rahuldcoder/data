-- best known for hosting @entity2 's enormously popular series " @entity7 , " @entity4 extreme adventurist @entity3 recently released his autobiography , " @entity6			1
" the book is essentially the story of how @entity3 became the grub eating , naturalist risk taker that has captivated a global audience			1
the chapters are short and punchy ; rarely do they go over three pages and @entity3 opens up about his formative years growing up on the @entity15 , his time spent at boarding schools and in the @entity18 ( the @entity18 ) , his inabilities to woo girls and his recovery from a parachuting accident that left his back broken			1
earlier this year , @entity3 and @entity2 failed to come to contract agreements , so at the moment he 's currently searching for a new television project			1
meanwhile he 's enjoying a bit of success for his appearances in a series of @entity32 deodorant commercials			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity3 in @entity33 as he was preparing for a book signing			1
@entity0 : everyone knows about the extreme conditions you put yourself through			1
do you write in extreme conditions ? @entity39 : no , i did n't want to be away filming , then get home and be a dad and be writing			1
so i made a rule : i would only write on flights			1
and i had a load of those			1
maybe 18 months on a plane			1
so i did n't write at home ; i need every sense and focus when i 'm there			2
@entity0 : but it was at a high altitude , just a little more contained			2
@entity39 : ( @entity54 ) yeah			2
when you 're out there , you need every sense of your body working for you			1
that 's why i 'm always exhausted at the end of those days			1
you do n't have time for anything like that			2
@entity0 : at this point for you , which is harder for you : surviving a publisher deadline or surviving deadly conditions ? @entity39 : well , the deadlines are n't going to kill you			2
i do n't adhere strictly to deadlines -- writing ones			2
it 's always going to be delayed because stuff takes longer ... i always figure no rush			1
i take the deadly deadlines more serious than the publisher 's deadlines			1
@entity0 : the first third of the book , you discuss your formative years			2
you seem like a pretty well - adjusted guy			2
no rebellious drug phase or dark goth phase			2
@entity39 : i think there was more stumbling than that , but i was focused			2
i found at a young age that i could do well at what i loved			2
@entity0 : in the early chapters , it becomes evident that you 're not self - conscious about your body			2
in fact , you seem to generally okay with getting naked			2
@entity39 : yeah , i grew up on an island so for me , i was always running around naked			0
still am when i 'm around good friends			0
i loved it in my workouts in the morning , at dawn , without any clothes on , doing pull ups on the bar			0
obviously on the show , you 're always getting naked diving in the water , but the truth is , however many days of filming , i 'm going to get my skivvs off and have a wash			0
but they always film that and that 's out of my control			1
i 'm usually naked for about 3 minutes over four days , but that happens to be 3 minutes of the show			0
it 's a little bit harsh , but when i 'm relaxed and with friends and stuff , i 'm always skinny dipping in the sea			1
i love all of that			0
@entity0 : you also detail your time spent in the @entity18 and @entity123 -- did you identify more with the idea behind the @entity18 or more of the physical aspects of it ? @entity39 : i always loved the ethos there			0
the regiment of character of the individual			0
there was something i loved about that			0
you could be a scruff , but everybody was encouraged to have peers and you 've got be able to laugh at yourself and work under pressure with each other and not have an ego			0
those sort of things mattered			0
the unofficial motto is the " the regiment , the misfits working together			1
" @entity0 : you discuss the parachuting accident that you had where you broke your back			0
were you classified as depressed during that time ? @entity39 : people said you must 've been positive to go through a broken back but the truth was it was n't like that			0
it was a very dark time with struggle and doubt			0
i think the hard thing for me was not knowing			0
none of the doctors could tell me if i would walk properly again or climb properly again			0
i realized i could determine what was best for me and that 's why i chose ( to climb ) @entity161 as the goal			1
people looked at me like i was crazy , but the staff at the rehab center knew the power of a dream and having a focus like that			0
@entity0 : watching your shows and reading your book , there 's the idea that you do n't need a lot of modern technology to live			1
what are your thoughts on that ? are we too reliant on technology these days ? @entity39 : technology is great ; it allows me to communicate with my family when i 'm in remote areas			0
but the downside is that it disempowers people to display skills that without technology they could depend on for their life			0
so i think the key is to still having those skills , but using technology to help you			0
you always got to plan for the worst and hope for the best			0
if the @entity194 is n't going to work , if the lifeboat is n't going to work , you still got to know how to navigate across the mountains , across the bridges			0
skills like that are very natural and basic to learn			0
i 've taken people out who have more money than the world and they start smiling when they make their own fire			0
it 's deep inside thousands and thousands of years in our psyche			1
it 's the best free entertainment you can get			1
it 's the natural world			1
technology is great but it 's never going to be as much fun as creating something out of nothing			1
@entity0 : are you working on any shows for this year or next ? @entity39 : yeah , well we 're kind of offers and ideas coming in at the moment			1
we 're just trying to be smart and wise			0
definitely making programs that are about adventure and empowering people			0
that 's been the driving force for me in the tv side of my life .			1
