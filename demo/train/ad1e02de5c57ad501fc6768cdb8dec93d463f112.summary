-- @entity1 and @entity2 are in charge of one of @entity6 's most rigorous selection processes			0
last week 140 candidates were brought before them and evaluated by appearance , body , character and even how bitter they are			0
" any flaws or problems here on the ground just get magnified in the air , " said @entity1 in knowing tones			2
while it may sound like the way stewardesses were selected some 40 years ago , @entity1 and @entity18 were actually in @entity22 to pick out new additions for the airline 's wine selection			2
it 's a job that 's kept @entity27 busy for over 24 years as a consultant for the airline			0
" it 's a dark and lonely life , " he quipped , " but someone has to do it			0
" each year around 3,000 glasses of wine are checked by the pair 's educated palates , and through blind tastings with other connoisseurs they decide what vintages will thrive at 35,000 feet and appeal to discerning drinkers in each travel class			1
tannins and bitter tones in wines are exacerbated by dry cabin air and some wines do n't fare well with the vibrations from air travel and become " bottle shocked , " the experts say			1
it 's often the delicate fruit tones that add a depth and richness to wines that are first to take a hit			1
white wines do n't have such a problem , says @entity1 , and if you like the taste of a champagne on the ground it 's more than likely to taste just as good in the air ( regardless of how much you drink )			1
since reds are more delicate and sensitive to flight , @entity1 admits that the @entity70 offerings ca n't compare with a glass at a wine - buff 's dinner party			2
however what those in @entity75 and @entity76 are still some of the best around			0
@entity6 's new line - up includes a selection of @entity81 from some of the most renowned vineyards in the @entity84			0

for @entity91 , one of the world 's largest airlines , that figure is more like 7 million bottles , according to the airline			1
as well as taking a sizable chunk of an airline 's inflight catering budget , wines also contributes a large part to an airline 's image , particularly among premium passengers			1
wines are increasingly " critical " to the way an airline is perceived , believes @entity108 , @entity6 's @entity109 of @entity110			2
" people expect very good wines onboard , " he said , highlighting growing interest in wine in @entity115 and the enduring popularity of wines from @entity120 's @entity119 region			1
for vineyards , being chosen as a @entity75 and business class selection is also good business			2
" wineries see the first class cabin as a really sexy place to be , as a place where they want their labels to be seen , " said @entity124 , master sommelier for @entity91			1

" the new world wines with their jammier fruits show a little bit better than older world wines , but that 's painting with a broad brush and ultimately it depends on personal tastes , " he says			0
@entity1 echoes that , eschewing any notions of wine snobbery : " it does n't matter what it is ; you either like it or you do n't			0
" @entity6 's cabin crew are given tasting lessons by @entity1 and @entity18 so they can recommend wines with particular foods served on board , but they 're absolutely forbidden from sampling the wine while flying or taking any opened bottles home at the end of a flight			1
so what does happen to all those opened bottles when inflight service ends ? @entity166 , get ready for a different kind of " bottle shock "			0
" they get poured away , " says @entity108			0
" it 's to makes sure they do n't reappear on board and get served by mistake			0
