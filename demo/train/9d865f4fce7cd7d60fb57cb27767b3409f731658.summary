@entity0 , @entity1 in driving snow and frigid temperatures , one @entity1 fighter on a tank leaving the besieged town of @entity0 described it as " a one - way street to the grave			1
" the surrounding roads are littered with the wreckage of what were once @entity1 military positions , an obliterated checkpoint , the remains of people in an armed personnel carrier hit by an explosion			2
inside the once bustling town , the icy , devastated , streets are empty			2
the few civilians too old or sick to flee cower indoors desperately , hoping not to be killed by the near - constant shelling			2
@entity25 does n't discriminate , and nurseries have been hit by shells as well as @entity28 , devastating the city 's infrastructure			0
this small transport hub in eastern @entity1 has become a focus for bitter violence between @entity1 military and @entity36 separatists following a ceasefire agreement four days ago that has faltered			1
most of @entity1 's armed forces have been pulled out of the strategic railroad town following weeks of fierce gunbattles and street fights , according to its military , while one rebel leader claimed that separatists had taken over 80 % of the town			1
separatists claimed to have 60 @entity1 prisoners of war , although @entity2 can not independently verify those claims			2
if you had n't heard of @entity0 before today , it 's not surprising			0
it was a small , nondescript @entity54 - era town , which had a population of just 25,000 before fighting started			1
so why exactly has it become a key focus for violence ? strategic hub for one thing , @entity0 is a vital rail transport hub for the @entity36 rebels			1
it is the site of strategic rail and highway junctions that connect rebel - held strongholds of @entity66 and @entity67 , which is near the @entity69 border			1
part of infrastructure built in the @entity54 era when @entity1 was part of the @entity54 , @entity0 is key for transporting coal , steel and supporting other heavy industries in the region			1
@entity0 's rail hub is one of three crucial positions -- the other two being @entity66 international airport and the industrial port of @entity83 -- which , if caught , would be ideal for @entity69 to open a land corridor to recently annexed @entity85 , according to the @entity86			1
ceasefire misfire ? @entity0 , at that time held by @entity1 forces but encircled by separatists , was not specifically addressed in the ceasefire agreement			1
it was always an issue of contention : separatists believed it was theirs under the recent @entity96 agreement			0
" the separatists took it as @entity99 that the city was theirs , " reports @entity2 's @entity97			0
geographically , it was a little bit of @entity1 - controlled land that stuck up into separatist - controlled areas that they wanted , he said			1
" it was always within their territory because they 'd encircled it , ( the separatists contended ) , " @entity97 said			0
" although that 's not the way the @entity111 or @entity112 perceived it			0
" civilian toll fighting in the city -- which a spokesman for the @entity1 government 's military operation , @entity119 , last week described as the most dangerous place in the country -- has taken a huge toll on the civilian population			1
only 3,000 - 4,000 of @entity0 's former population of 25,000 remain			1
outside the city , near the village of @entity127 , separatist shells rocked the farmland -- fired from an @entity130 , according to experts @entity132 's -- more evidence of the kind of modern firepower in separatist hands			0
civilians have been caught in the crossfire between artillery coming from rebels on one side and the @entity1 army on the other -- and have literally had nowhere to run			2
many have been trying to find shelter from the violence underground , living in basements			2
a local resident , @entity148 , bundled against the cold in a red coat and woolen headscarf , wept as she described how her husband @entity152 was killed in november about a week before he turned 65			0
" he said , ' run ! get down in the basement			0
' but he stayed up here and the shell hit			0
he lived for a moment , but he died just here			0
and it tore up everything			0
how can we live ? " @entity2 's @entity159 in @entity160 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 , a small town in eastern @entity1 , has been a focus for violence
one @entity1 *soldier* leaving the area called it " a one - way street to the grave "
it is a crucial rail hub for rebel - held areas , connecting @entity67 and @entity66
fighting has devastated the area and the civilians who are left are living underground
