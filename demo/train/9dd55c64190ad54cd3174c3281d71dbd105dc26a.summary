-- last week , three teenage girls from @entity2 were alleged to have tried to join @entity3			1
the girls were stopped by @entity6 officials as they transited @entity7 in @entity8 and were sent back to @entity9			1
the key lead in this case was n't high - tech surveillance by the @entity13 or a tip by a government informant , but a tip to the @entity6 by the girls ' worried families			1
@entity19 , the @entity21 - @entity20 father of one of the girls , received a call from his daughter 's @entity2 school telling him she was missing			1
when he tried calling her , she did not pick up			2
@entity19 went to the father of the other two girls to check whether their passports were missing			1
the families then went to the @entity6 , which intercepted the girls at the @entity7 airport			1
the key role that families play in preventing violent extremism is often overlooked in favor of focusing on more exotic counterterrorism measures such as the @entity13 's surveillance programs or the use of paid informants			1
in fact , a survey by the @entity45 of 251 jihadist terrorism cases in the @entity20 since 9/11 found that almost a third of the individuals accused of engaging in some kind of terrorist crime have been implicated by a tip from a family member or a member of the @entity56 - @entity20 community			1
by contrast , only a little more than 1 % of these cases was generated by one of the @entity13 's most controversial surveillance programs , in which the agency collected every @entity20 's phone data for several years			1
families are often critical in stopping radicalizing individuals from stepping over the edge into militant activity			1
take @entity67 , a 20 - year - old @entity68 man who was charged in july with committing passport fraud in an effort to join @entity3			1
his mother hid his passport so he could not leave the country			0
when more than 20 @entity76 - @entity20 left from @entity77 after 2007 to fight for the @entity79 affiliated @entity78 in @entity80 , family and community members played critical roles in the ensuing @entity6 investigation			0
after @entity86 's nephew , @entity84 , left to fight for @entity78 in @entity80 in november 2008 , @entity83 worked to organize community cooperation with the government 's investigation			0
as @entity98 , who oversaw the @entity6 's investigation , put it in 2009 when the @entity100 unsealed charges against eight men accused of supporting @entity78 , " it is through the sustained and dedicated efforts of the @entity92 and the support of the @entity76 - @entity20 community that today we are able to disclose some of the significant progress we have achieved in this critical investigation			0
families are not a panacea			2
sometimes family members intervene with a radicalizing individual , but the intervention does n't work			0
@entity108 , a 19 - year - old @entity9 woman , pleaded guilty in september to conspiring to provide material support to @entity3			1
her family sought to dissuade her from seeking to join jihadists in @entity112 , but their efforts failed and she was arrested on april 8 at @entity115 on her way to @entity112			2
@entity117 traveled to @entity118 from @entity119 , @entity120 , in 2009 where he became the editor of @entity124 's @entity123 despite several attempts by his family members and elders from the local @entity56 - @entity20 community to dissuade him from his militant views			0
two years later @entity117 was killed in a @entity20 drone strike in @entity118			0
sometimes a family will warn @entity20 authorities about a radicalizing child , but the warning is n't sufficiently followed up on			2
the @entity140 " underwear bomber , " @entity135 , tried to blow up a bomb secreted in his underwear over @entity138 on christmas day 2009			0
luckily the bomb failed to detonate			0
a month earlier , @entity142 's father had gone to the @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity140 , and told @entity146 officials there that he believed his son was meeting with extremists in @entity118			2
the @entity20 @entity143 in @entity140 issued a warning to the @entity20 @entity151 , but @entity142 was not put on the " no fly " list and the center 's analysts did not make an effort to determine if @entity142 possessed a valid @entity20 visa			0
families are often , of course , the first to notice if a son or daughter is radicalizing and are a key bulwark against extremism			2
why and how some people radicalize is a subject that is complex , but one indicator is usually unambiguous and that is that radicalizing individuals will often spend a great deal of time on jihadist websites or consuming jihadist social media			0
many parents do n't have much of a clue about what is happening online , but a common sense approach if they suspect their son or daughter is radicalizing is to get a better handle on their children 's social media use and profile .			0

3 @entity9 girls are intercepted on their way to the @entity186 , allegedly to join @entity3
their families *alerted* authorities , who were able to find them in @entity7 airport
@entity194 : families often spot signs of radicalization and alert officials
more terrorism plots *disrupted* by families than by controversial @entity13 surveillance
