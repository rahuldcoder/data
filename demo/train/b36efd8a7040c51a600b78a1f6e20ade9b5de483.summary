-- the new district attorney of @entity2 , @entity3 , said he plans to take a fresh look at the investigation into the 1996 slaying of @entity7			1
the da 's office assumed responsibility for the investigation in 2002			2
but district attorney @entity12 told @entity0 that he wants to decide during his first 30 days in office whether the case should be returned to @entity2 police			1
" i 'm trying to determine whether it 's efficient to have the ongoing investigation handled by my office or somebody else , " said @entity12 , who was sworn in as district attorney january 13			1
the da 's office is relatively small , he said , with 27 lawyers and six investigators handling between 2,000 and 2,500 felony cases a year			2
although the @entity27 case has not generated news since last year , tips and information regularly come in to authorities			1
whoever is handling the investigation is charged with checking them out and deciding whether they are worth pursuing , @entity12 said			2
he said reports that he is considering reopening the case are inaccurate			0
" it 's not closed			0
it has n't been solved , and it 's been open the whole time			0
" the case is one of the nation 's most famous unsolved murders			2
on december 26 , 1996 , @entity27 discovered the body of his 6 - year - old daughter , @entity7 , in the basement of the family 's @entity2 home			1
the girl had been strangled and beaten			0
a ransom note was found on the stairs of the home , demanding $ 118,000			0
early in the case , @entity2 police said @entity7 's parents , @entity53 and @entity54 , were under " an umbrella of suspicion " in her death			1
but they were never formally named as suspects , and a grand jury refused to indict them			0
@entity54 died in 2006 after a lengthy battle with ovarian cancer			0
in july , @entity12 's predecessor , @entity61 , issued a public apology for the suspicion surrounding the @entity27 family after a dna test performed using new technology showed that @entity64 found on @entity7 's underwear and under her fingernails belonged to an unidentified man			1
the test results , @entity61 said , were " powerful evidence " that allows investigators to think the @entity27 family were victims , not suspects			0
that same third - party dna exonerated @entity7 , a one - time teacher , after he was arrested in @entity75 and brought to @entity3			1
authorities said @entity7 told a @entity78 professor in e-mails that he was involved in @entity7 's death			1
he told reporters after his arrest that he was with the child when she died , although he called her death an accident and said he loved her			0
@entity61 was widely criticized , including by then - gov. @entity89 , for the handling of @entity7 's arrest			1
@entity2 police also have long faced criticism over their handling of the investigation			1
but , @entity12 said friday , " i 've been very impressed by the @entity96 they are a fine department now and have handled a number of cases very well			2
... they 've done a very nice job			0
" the department has 24 investigators , four times as many as the @entity107 's staff , he said			0
@entity12 was elected @entity107 in november to replace @entity61 , who could not run again because of term limits			2
before he was elected , he served as a trial lawyer for 22 years , according to the @entity107 's web site .			0
