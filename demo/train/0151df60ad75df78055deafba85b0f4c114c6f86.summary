-- president @entity1 needs to send @entity3 marshals to @entity4			1
they can protect the @entity7 women and children whom the federal government has sent out @entity10 , with more due to arrive every 72 hours under an immigrant redistribution plan hatched by the @entity1 administration			1
the next group of immigrants is expected to arrive on july 7			0
the marshals could ensure that nobody interferes with this federal law enforcement operation , as was done last week by angry protesters in @entity19 , @entity4 , a small town in southwest @entity20 , about 70 miles north of @entity21			1
it was there that the @entity24 had planned to process about 140 women and children who had , just a few hours earlier , arrived on a plane from @entity28			1
more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors have been caught trying to cross the @entity3 - @entity31 border since october			1
i 've written about immigration for 25 years and , from my many visits to the @entity3 - @entity31 border , and the tours i 've taken with @entity24 agents in @entity37 , @entity28 and @entity4 , i know this much : the war against immigrant smugglers is a battle of wits and a contest of wills			1
in managing the border children crisis , the @entity24 recently showed wits			1
now , by sending in the marshals , @entity1 can demonstrate the will			1
last week , on the @entity48 , @entity24 agents avoided some unpleasant fireworks by outsmarting dozens of those who are against the buses and those who are n't			2
both crowds had descended on @entity19 anticipating a repeat of what had happened three days earlier , when the group protesting the arrivals blocked and turned around three @entity56 buses carrying the women and children			1
in both protests , @entity19 police officers were on the scene			1
but during the first one , they were worthless			0
they should have arrested those protesters who blocked @entity24 buses and forced them to retreat			2
they were better during the sequel , and , in fact , arrested a handful of people			0
while the dueling crowds were facing off in @entity19 , the @entity24 took a detour from the airport and transported the immigrants to another processing center in @entity77 , about 15 miles south of @entity21			1
there will likely be more protests in @entity4 over the next few weeks			2
if things get out of hand , someone could get hurt			0
that 's why we need @entity3 marshals , to prevent that from happening			1
i should n't have to make federal case out of this , because it already is one			0
it 's a federal policy that lets these children stay in the @entity3 with relatives			2
they 're in the custody of a federal agency , in a federal law enforcement vehicle , driven by federal law enforcement officers			1
it 's the federal government 's job to protect its personnel and the people being transported and to ensure that this operation is not sidetracked by mob rule , even if that means arresting those who get in the way			2
the images coming out of @entity19 reminded me of another group of protesters intent on defying an order from the federal government : white @entity111 in the 1960s			1
they also terrorized children , african - americans who sought to attend desegregated public schools , much as the children on the bus were terrorized by the angry mob			0
it 's not a perfect comparison ; the children on the bus were undocumented immigrants , many of whom might qualify for refugee status if they can show " credible fear " of returning to their home countries			0
the @entity128 - @entity3 children were @entity3 citizens			2
still , i was n't the only person in @entity3 thinking that we had seen this movie before			2
" this green - eyed and blond - with - gray woman who is 74 years old can not believe that ' my fellow citizens ' have n't learned anything over the last 50 - plus years , " wrote one reader			0
" i remember college friends who went to @entity137 and @entity138 to help register voters , teach people to read , march for civil rights for all of us , no matter what color or race or socioeconomic status			0
opinion : the right fate for immigrant kids " the screaming and hateful people in ( @entity19 ) reminded me of the people who screamed at little black kids walking to schools ( accompanied by law enforcement ) , who treated @entity156 and @entity157 and so many young people horribly			1
it is so sad that after all these years , so many people have n't gotten a clue about decency and kindness			0
" in 1956 , @entity157 was the first @entity128 to attend the @entity164			0
in 1962 , @entity156 became the first african - american to attend the @entity166			0
both students were tormented by classmates			0
once @entity156 enrolled at @entity166 , rioting broke out on the @entity171 , @entity138 , campus			0
attorney general @entity172 sent 500 @entity3 marshals to maintain order and protect the civil rights pioneer			1
by trying to thwart the intent of the federal government , the @entity19 mob seems to want to relive the ' 60s			2
let 's go back to the ' 60s			0
send in the marshals .			0

@entity182 : @entity1 needs to send @entity3 marshals to protect women , kids at border
federal law enforcement *relocation* operation met with protests in @entity19 , @entity4
on july 4 , @entity24 *tricked* the *anti-immigration* protesters by going somewhere else
the faces in @entity19 reminded @entity182 of white @entity111 blocking desegregation
