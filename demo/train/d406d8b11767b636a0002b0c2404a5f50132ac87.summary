-- late last month , school officials at @entity2 in @entity3 , @entity4 , sent 7 - year - old straight - a student @entity6 home crying			1
her offense ? wearing dreadlocks			1
the school 's policy at the time said " hairstyles such as dreadlocks , afros , mohawks , and other faddish styles are unacceptable			1
" rather than change their daughter 's hair to adhere to the school 's policies , @entity6 's parents , @entity23 and @entity24 , instead made the brave decision to remove their daughter from the school			1
the charter school 's board decided monday night to change its dress code , but when i first learned about the story , and saw @entity6 in tears , it reminded me of a time in my life when i yearned to have long , straight flowing hair			1
hair that looked nothing like the hair that grew naturally out of my head			0
hair that my mother would have to pay someone else to create through chemical processing			0
hair that , when it was " done , " still did n't look " did " -- at least not like the tresses that garnished the heads of all the little girls that other children and adults named " pretty			1
" hair that forever escaped me			0
hair that , in its absence , made me cry			0
whereas i spent most of my youth chasing beauty , at only 7 , @entity6 and her parents are simply seeking affirmation for a beauty that is the child 's own ; a beauty that would take me another 17 years to find			1
seeing that precious little brown girl break down and cry in front of news cameras , i became instantly focused on her			1
and her self - reflection			0
and i wanted to do something for her			0
so i reached out to other women with dreadlocks -- more positively referred to as " locs " -- to create a care package , of sorts , to affirm a little girl 's beauty ; a digital book of photos and messages from 111 women and girls from all over the country and all over the world , all of whom wear their hair in locs , all of whom want @entity6 to know that she and her hair are perfect			1
when a 7 - year - old , straight - a student is removed from class and told that she can not go to her school any longer simply because she wears her hair in a culturally specific hairstyle , there is a big chance that her reflection on herself , and perhaps even her culture , will be negatively impacted			1
rather than run the risk that little @entity6 might look in the mirror and see something wrong , i wanted to manually , if not emotionally , insert a positive reflection for her , one that i myself did n't get until i was well into my adult years			0
it was n't until i was an adult that i learned about the politics of black beauty			1
we live in a society in which normative standards tend to reflect those ideals established by the dominant group			0
and in a racialized society such as our own , one in which the white ideal is constantly pedestaled as the ideal against which all other bodies are measured , black bodies are often regarded substandard -- " unacceptable " as is			0
for black women , our ability to be perceived as beautiful in this society depends upon our ability to emulate a white ideal for feminine beauty			1
the closer our features are to white ones -- straight hair , light skin and aquiline features -- the more likely it is that we will be regarded as beautiful			0
so when compared to a white ideal , natural hair is not beautiful , especially not dreadlocks			2
but the issue here is n't just one of beauty			2
@entity6 was not asked to leave her school because her hair was judged " ugly			2
" she was asked to leave because school officials opined that her hair was " faddish " and " unacceptable			2
" the problem lies in perspective : on what grounds and on whose terms do we determine what is " acceptable ? " dreadlocks are rooted in our cultural history and are as old as humanity itself			2
yet @entity6 's @entity151 led school , one chartered by @entity150 , a historically black university , did n't view her hairstyle in the truth of its own cultural significance			2
and therein lies the issue			0
@entity6 's story is the one that made the news , but so many young girls question their beauty every single day			1
our girls need constant affirmation			2
girls need to know they are beautiful , even though there are people in this world that would have us believe that natural hair is " ugly " and " nasty			1
" if they ca n't pick up a magazine in the checkout line of the grocery store , turn to any page , and see themselves reflected , then we as adults have to provide them that reflection			0
" a @entity195 of @entity196 " is one such reflection -- my attempt to begin to ground @entity6 and all the little @entity184 in their own culture , and in their own norms , and in their own beauty , lest they be forced to compare themselves to others , lest they look in the mirror and find something wrong			2
plus , i just want them all to know that they have an army of sisters , cousins , aunties , mamas , grandmothers and elders all over the world who support them			0
i sent the care package to @entity6 and her family			0
when i spoke to them sunday , they were extremely thankful for the outpouring of love and support			0
and when i asked @entity6 how she was feeling , she responded , " much better			0
" a few hours later she sent me a text to tell me her message to little girls -- " believe in yourself			2
" as i did back in december , after @entity0 aired its documentary " who is @entity221 ? " and as i do often , i 'm calling on everyone to join me in " singing a black girl 's song , " not only for @entity6 , but for all the little girls who could benefit from the affirmation of their beauty and their value			1
an intimate weaving of past and present , memory and contemporary , their stories are our stories			0
perhaps if they know that we truly understand , they can be encouraged to see themselves through our eyes ; perhaps they will soon be able to see themselves for what they are : pretty brown girls			1
no matter her hair texture , length , color or style , please , in some way , tell a little black girl that she is beautiful today			0
