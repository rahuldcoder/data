-- longtime " @entity2 " judge @entity1 said he 'll be leaving the popular @entity4 talent show at the end of the season , the network announced monday at the @entity9 press tour in @entity10 , @entity11			1
@entity1 's popular @entity13 talent show , " @entity14 , " will be coming to the @entity15 in the fall of 2011 with the acerbic critic in tow , according to @entity4			1
" i want to leave ' @entity2 ' this year bigger and better than it was in the past , " @entity1 said at the @entity9 tour monday			1
@entity1 will be both executive producer and judge on " @entity14			1
" " i 'm thrilled that we have put a date on the launch of the @entity15 version of ' @entity14 , ' and delighted to be continuing to work with @entity4 , " said @entity1 in a statement			1
" we have a fantastic relationship , a great team and are all very excited about this			0
" @entity30 : will you watch " idol " without @entity1 ? speculation has raged for weeks as to @entity1 's future			1
though he 's well paid for his " idol " work -- an estimated $ 36 million per season -- he has expressed a desire to focus on " @entity14			1
" @entity1 said at the press session that it 's taken some time to reach an agreement for his new duties , hence the buzz			2
( indeed , he signed the last page of his " contract " on stage with @entity4 executives @entity45 and @entity47			0
) " [ @entity48 ] did n't think it was right to do two shows in @entity15 at the same time , so [ @entity48 ] decided to leave one and start another , " he said			2
he said he missed @entity53 , the former " idol " judge who left the show in august , but would n't confirm or deny whether she would appear on " @entity14 " in the @entity55 and @entity56 had a good - naturedly contentious relationship on " @entity2 , " with the tough - minded @entity58 often acting as bad cop to the " @entity62 " singer 's good cop			1
@entity63 , who 's taking over @entity56 's judging slot , joked about @entity1 's announcement on her talk show monday -- getting in a dig at @entity69 's late - night troubles as well			1
" so this just happened , @entity1 just announced that he 's leaving ' idol			2
' this will be his last season			0
he announced he 's leaving on my first day			2
i 'm trying not to take it personally , " she said			0
" but seriously , i am going to be very , very sad to see him go , because i think he 's made the show what it is			0
he 's a huge part of that show but he wanted a change			0
i wish him all the luck in the world hosting ' @entity86 , ' " said @entity63 , referring to widespread speculation about how @entity69 will resolve its issues with its late - night talk shows			0
in reality , of course , @entity1 has not been part of that speculation			2
since its premiere in 2002 , " idol " has been an entertainment phenomenon , regularly ranking as tv 's top show , creating several musical stars and pulling in millions more viewers than its closest competition			0
its new season premieres tuesday			0
@entity1 's presence has been credited as a major reason			1
the @entity104 music executive was a judge on the @entity104 version of " idol , " " @entity107 , " and came to the @entity15 when @entity4 imported the show			0
unlike judges on many @entity15 talent shows , @entity1 did n't sugar - coat his criticisms to contestants			2
with the show 's growing popularity -- by its fourth season it was the top show on television , a rank it has held ever since -- @entity1 and fellow " idol " players @entity56 , judge @entity122 and amiable host @entity123 became stars in their own right			1
though the show continues to dominate @entity15 tv , ratings have started sliding in " @entity2 's " past two seasons			1
but @entity1 told the @entity9 audience he had no doubt about the show 's future			2
it will " continue to be the no. 1 show " in the country , @entity1 said			0
the show has given him " the best days of my life			0
" asked who should replace him , he jokingly suggested @entity123 , with whom @entity1 has also good - naturedly tangled			0
the @entity4 executives said they 're not going to rush to find @entity1 's replacement			1
@entity0 's @entity143 contributed to this story .			0

@entity1 leaving " @entity2 " after this season
@entity1 's " @entity14 " coming to @entity15 in 2011
@entity1 's acerbic commentary has been a big reason for " @entity2 's " popularity
