-- not for the first time @entity1 , who plays for one of @entity4 's biggest soccer teams @entity3 , is in the spotlight again			1
the @entity8 international is the focus of racially charged remarks made by @entity3 vice president @entity11 , the younger brother of former prime minister and team owner @entity12			1
during a political rally for his brother where he invited the public to an upcoming match , the younger @entity12 was caught on camera -- the video is now featured on the website of @entity8 newspaper @entity21 -- saying : " ok , we are all off to see the family 's little black boy			1
" he 's a crazy head			0
all the young ladies are invited as well -- you can even have a chance to meet the president [ @entity12 ]			2
" @entity3 declined to comment on the remarks when contacted by @entity0 , while @entity1 's representatives have yet to respond to phone and email messages			1
@entity8 national team striker @entity1 joined @entity3 last week after a two - and - a - half - year stint with @entity37 champions @entity36 , during which time he attracted media attention for his off - field antics and ill discipline on the pitch			1
the incident involving @entity12 's brother comes one month after another racial incident involving a black @entity3 player			1
@entity3 's @entity48 - born @entity47 international midfielder @entity46 walked off the pitch after being subjected to racist chanting during a friendly match with fourth division team @entity52			1
@entity12 , as well as world football head @entity53 , backed @entity46 for taking a strong stance against prejudicial abuse , though the @entity57 president noted that walk - offs are not a long - term solution to the problem			1
offensive @entity8 football expert and author @entity62 explained how @entity11 's words were offensive on several levels			1
" it is an insult , " @entity62 told @entity0			2
" it 's not n * * * * * translated , but it would translate as ' little negro ' or ' little family negro '			2
a lot of @entity8 would n't necessarily see it as racist , but that does n't mean it is n't			1
" i 'm sure @entity1 would see it as an insult			2
even if you take the racial element out of it , it is quite insulting			0
the idea that they own this person has a lot of other connotations			0
" @entity1 played for @entity3 's city rivals @entity84 between 2006 and 2010 , during which time he was subjected to racist abuse by @entity87 fans during a match in 2009			1
@entity89 thinks how @entity1 responds should such an incident occur again in the future could shape how @entity8 football tackles racism			1
" when the first racist chants appear in a game he is playing in , are the players going to walk off ? " @entity89 asked			0
" that is going to be a key moment			0
i think it will happen			0
" it has entered into the football stadiums in the late 1980s and early 1990s			0
some things have been done , but generally there is not a zero tolerance approach towards it			0
" it 's not just individuals			0
in @entity8 it could be a large part of the hardcore fans doing it , therefore it is a lot harder to deal with			2
" i think the @entity46 incident was really positive because it put the issue on the agenda and said , ' we 're not going to take this anymore ' and he was backed by the authorities which was really good			0
" let 's see if they put their money where their mouth is and walk off during a @entity125 game which is on television			0
if they do , i think it will have an impact			0
" when the deal -- worth around $ 31 million -- to bring @entity1 to @entity3 was announced last week , @entity130 estimated the signing of " @entity1 " could be worth 400,000 votes in @entity12 's bid for re-election in @entity8 later this month			1
while the incident could damage @entity12 's image abroad , @entity89 doubted it would affect his popularity in @entity8			1
" his reputation abroad is pretty appalling anyway , " added @entity62			2
" there has n't been a debate in @entity8 about racist language			1
for a long time they used to use words to describe immigrants which were absolutely racist			2
" it is something i do n't think will have an impact on @entity12 domestically			1
" the word " negro " was the subject of a racism storm in @entity37 in 2011 , when @entity153 of @entity154 claimed he had repeatedly been called the word by @entity157 's @entity156			0
the accusations sparked a debate over cultural differences over the word 's meaning			2
watch : @entity166 football club faces fan backlash some claimed it was a term of endearment used in @entity171 , however @entity156 was handed an eight - match ban and a Â £ 40,000 ( $ 63,000 ) fine by @entity37 's football association			2
@entity174 is a @entity175 international who plays for @entity3 's @entity125 rivals @entity87			0
meanwhile , speaking from the @entity178 in @entity179 , where @entity175 play @entity180 in wednesday 's semifinal , @entity174 , who plays for @entity3 's @entity125 rivals @entity87 , called for an end to racist abuse in football			1
" football is about coming together , " the 24 - year - old @entity175 international told @entity0			0
" when it comes to something like this it makes you feel like you 're not a human being			0
" what i would say is please stop this racism because we are all one , we are all human beings			0
@entity186 is about fun and bringing people together			0
