@entity0 -- mounting tensions between the government and members of @entity7 's @entity6 ethnic minority erupted on the streets of the country 's largest city thursday , after @entity6 activists clashed with riot police at a protest organized by the main @entity6 nationalist political party			1
scores of @entity6 youths , many of them covering their face with bandannas , hurled stones and petrol bombs as security forces fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowds in @entity0			1
amid the chaos near the banks of the @entity27 , a @entity1 producer witnessed a man collapse , apparently overwhelmed by the clouds of noxious tear gas			1
nearby , flowers littered the pavement where a women 's flower stand had been overturned			1
the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) , @entity7 's main @entity6 political party , organized rallies in @entity0 and other @entity7 cities thursday to mark " @entity39			1
" but the rallies come within weeks of a fresh @entity7 military bombing campaign of @entity6 separatist rebels who have long operated out of camps and bases across the border in @entity46			2
tensions escalated after a @entity36 official , @entity48 , was killed sunday during clashes with security forces on the @entity7 side of the border			1
@entity48 was reportedly part of a group of @entity6 activists marching toward @entity46 to serve as human shields against the @entity7 aerial and artillery bombardment			2
the protest in @entity0 thursday began fairly peacefully			1
women in traditional @entity6 costumes led a column of thousands of people , many of them waving @entity36 flags and carrying banners that said " peace now immediately " and " long live the brotherhood of people			1
" since 1984 , fighters from the @entity69 , or @entity69 , have waged a bloody guerrilla war against the @entity7 state that has claimed more than 30,000 lives			2
for decades , @entity6 were the target of repressive government policies , implemented by officials who sometimes referred to members of @entity7 's largest ethnic minority as " mountain @entity7			2
" until just a few years ago , it was illegal to speak @entity6 on radio and television in @entity7			2
the government of prime minister @entity83 has tried to improve relations by launching a state @entity86 tv station in 2009			2
despite these steps , some of the demonstrators on thursday chanted " @entity83 murderer " and chanted " @entity91 will be the graveyard for fascism			2
" at one point in the march , @entity36 parliament member @entity95 successfully negotiated with police officers who had objected to some of the political banners			1
the signs were taken down , and the march proceeded			1
but then @entity1 journalists witnessed dozens of young masked men emerge and begin hurling stones at bus stops			1
as @entity6 youths hurled stones , police officers took cover behind fences firing round after round of tear gas into @entity115 's main square			1
frightened bystanders fled the scene choking			0
meanwhile , protesters also lobbed @entity120 cocktails into the melee			0
at one point , @entity1 cameraman @entity122 witnessed a mob of @entity6 activists viciously beating a man			0

a @entity7 police commander told @entity1 there were approximately 3,000 protesters participating in the rally			0
the officer , who did not volunteer his name or rank , estimated only a minority of the demonstrators , some 150 people , participated in the violence			0
but some @entity6 activists blamed the government for the clashes			0
" look , we are struggling for peace and @entity83 attacks us using tear gas , " said @entity146 , a female demonstrator , dressed in the white hooded veil traditionally worn by many @entity6 women			0
after a melee that lasted nearly two hours , demonstrators fled the scene			0
the ground was littered with shards glass from dozens of shattered bus stops and newspaper kiosques			0
billboards advertising the face of @entity7 's prime minister had been defaced with graphiti saying " the @entity163 will come to @entity7 and you will be on trial			0
" commuters began gingerly stepping through debris and past overturned police barriers , some of them wincing at the tear gas still lingering in one of @entity0 's busiest transit hubs			1
a pair of tourists from @entity175 wandered through the gas - canister strewn square pulling their suitcases , looking in vain for a shuttlebus to the airport			0
other protests were scheduled to be held in other @entity7 cities on thursday , including the southeastern city of @entity185 , the unofficial capital of @entity7 's @entity6 minority			0
