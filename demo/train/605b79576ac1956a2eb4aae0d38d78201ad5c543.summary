-- what if we could use solar energy when the sun has set , or wind energy when the air is calm ? @entity7 is working on a way to make that happen			1
the professor of materials chemistry at @entity12 is leading an effort to develop a new kind of battery -- a " liquid metal battery " -- that would enable the economical storage of energy from solar , wind and other sources so that it could be used when homes and businesses need it			1
@entity7 's work landed him on @entity26 's list of the world 's 100 most influential people this year and last month he was a guest on the @entity29			1
in march , he described his project in an interview with @entity0 after giving a talk at the @entity34 conference in @entity35 , @entity36			0
" we need to have reliable sources of electricity			0
and wind and solar in harmony with a battery become reliable 24/7 , " @entity7 said			1
watch @entity7 's @entity34 describing his group 's work at @entity12 , he said , " we think it 's a breakthrough because it addresses all of the uniquely demanding performance requirements of the grid , namely uncommonly high power , long service lifetime , but in addition , meeting the superlow price point of this application			1
@entity34 : using nature to grow batteries @entity7 explained the importance of the liquid metal battery in his @entity34 this way : " the electricity powering the lights in this theater was generated just moments ago			2
because the way things stand today , electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply			0
if in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage , some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid , the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately			2
but coal plants , nuclear plants ca n't respond fast enough			1
" with a giant battery , we 'd be able to address the problem of intermittency that prevents wind and solar from contributing to the grid in the same way that coal , gas and nuclear do today			2
" you see , the battery is the key enabling device here			0
with it , we could draw electricity from the sun even when the sun does n't shine			0
because then renewables such as wind and solar come out from the wings , here to center stage			2
" @entity34 : using biology to rethink the energy challenge inspired by the technique developed in the 19th century to produce aluminum at very low cost , @entity7 came up with the idea of using such commonly available materials as magnesium and antimony to create the battery			1
he co-founded a company , @entity115 , to commercialize the technology			0
in an e-mail interview this month , @entity7 answered some questions about his work : @entity0 : what makes the liquid metal battery ( or @entity122 ) better than other energy storage devices we have now ? @entity7 : @entity122 is designed to the price point of today 's electricity markets			1
this means it 's made of earth - abundant elements and is designed to be easy to manufacture			2
@entity0 : how would this battery change our society , economically and politically ? @entity7 : @entity122 would make today 's grid more robust ( less vulnerable to power failure ) , reduce price volatility , and make better use of existing generating assets ( allowing us to install capacity to meet average demand instead of peak demand )			1
@entity122 will also allow us to fully use intermittent renewables such as wind and solar			2
@entity0 : what are the dimensions of the battery and how much electricity can it store ? and do you expect future generations of the technology to be smaller or to store more power ? @entity7 : we are exploring various cell sizes at the moment to determine which will be most economical to manufacture			1
the battery ( which consists of many cells ) will be tailored to specific applications			0
for example , one variant will be the size of a 40 - foot shipping container and hold 2 mwh , enough electricity to meet the daily needs of 200 @entity170 households			0
@entity0 : what stage is your research at now ? is the product commercially viable ? @entity7 : research on campus at @entity12 proceeds with the search for new chemistries , i.e. , new alloys for the electrodes and new salt mixtures for the electrolyte			1
at @entity183 the focus is on design , construction and testing of a first commercial prototype ready for early 2014			0
@entity0 : who would market it and when do you think it would be on the market ? @entity7 : with our first commercial prototypes delivered in 2014 , we expect to ramp with partners very rapidly to widespread production and adoption across the globe			0
@entity0 : how much would a battery of this type cost ? @entity7 : @entity115 is aiming to deliver electricity storage without subsidies			1
we are focused on delivering value equal to or greater than existing alternatives such as peaking power plants as well as building out transmission lines			0
@entity0 : who would buy it ? @entity7 : we expect that over time we 'll see interest in @entity122 technology from utilities and conventional as well as renewable project developers			0
ultimately , this may extend to also include electricity consumers from large industrials to individual residences			0
at @entity34 , @entity7 got enthusiastic applause when he told the audience : " if we 're going to get this country out of its current energy situation , we ca n't just conserve our way out ; we ca n't just drill our way out ; we ca n't bomb our way out			1
we 're going to do it the old - fashioned @entity170 way , we 're going to invent our way out , working together			0

solar , wind energy ca n't provide reliable 24/7 power without a way to store it
@entity7 at @entity12 is working on a battery that would enable low - cost , mass storage
he says if power could be stored , the energy business would be changed *forever*
@entity7 : answer to our energy issues is n't only conservation or drilling , it 's innovation
