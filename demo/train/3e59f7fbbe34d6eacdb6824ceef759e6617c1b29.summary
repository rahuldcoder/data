life is n't easy in @entity1 , one of @entity4 's largest slums			1
about one million people live in this sprawling settlement in @entity7 , @entity8 's capital , with limited access to electricity , running water and other basic infrastructure services			1
getting by here demands a rugged resilience from @entity1 's inhabitants -- a willingness to help their neighbors , and group together in times of need			1
but the everyday challenges of life here have n't been a barrier to local people expressing themselves			1
the slum is also home to the @entity28 , which gives local creative talent the opportunity to tell stories about their world to a broader audience			1
to understand their stories , you first have to understand the conditions they live in			2
@entity39 , a @entity1 resident and film - maker who captures the street life of these poor neighborhoods in his movies , has offered me a tour of the settlement to give an insight into some of the challenges faced here			1
@entity1 began more than a century ago as an informal settlement in the forests outside @entity7 , where the @entity53 colonial authorities gave allocations of land to @entity57 soldiers returning from service with the @entity59			1
from these small , forested plots , a vast settlement has sprung in an haphazard , unplanned way , leaving residents without access to fresh running water in their homes			1
" the pipes that supply clean water to the slums are broken , " says @entity39			1
instead , the locals have rigged pipes to the city water supply			2
they collect water rations in containers wherever they can find it : from overflowing dams during the rainy season , as well as burst pipes			2
" when pipes burst like this , some get ( it ) free and some are paying for it , " says @entity39			0

because the inhabitants of @entity1 are among @entity7 's poorest , the goods in its markets are sold at very low price points			1
cigarettes are sold singly , and most of the clothes for sale are second - hand : a pair of used jeans can be bought for about $ 2			0
homes are built of a mixture of concrete , mud and wood , often by the labor of locals pitching in to help each other			2
there are no toilets inside			0
" people come together because they like helping each other , " says @entity39			0
" some decide to build a house because ( there 's ) no employment around			0
" some of those underemployed residents are finding an outlet through the @entity28			0
the school was founded by @entity125 film - maker @entity124 , who came to @entity7 in 2006 to research @entity4 storytelling			1
in collaboration with locals , he made a short film , " @entity129 , " which went on to win a number of international awards			2
he subsequently launched a non-profit to start the @entity28 in 2009 , with the aim of providing local people a chance to tell their stories through film , and gain the skills to work in the local film and television industries			1

" i realized i have a lot of talent in camera work and filming , and that 's when i applied , " he said			0
having discovered his passion for film - making , @entity39 has made a number of projects -- documentaries about schools , commercials , and a feature film on the gangster scene			0
and today , he has returned to the school to teach photography			0
" i feel like i want to use this talent to give back to the community , " he says			0
many other graduates have gone on to successful careers in the industry			2
" they found the right way , and the right channel to follow , " he said			0
" most of them are working in big companies with ( in the ) film production industries			0
" he said the school was " transforming lives of people living in slums ... how they think and want their thoughts to be seen visually			1
" as for him ? " i think it 's changing my life , " he said			0
" i see big changes			0
