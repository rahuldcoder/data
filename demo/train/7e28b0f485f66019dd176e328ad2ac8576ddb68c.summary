-- the @entity1 is not a sporting event -- it is an obsession			0
since 1882 , @entity5 and @entity6 's cricketers have fought , wrestled and spilled blood in one of the world 's fiercest rivalries			1
whether it be on the rugby field or on the cricket pitch , these two countries only care about one thing -- winning			0
on wednesday , when @entity5 and @entity6 go head to head in cricket 's biggest contest , the @entity1 , two countries will hold their collective breath and prepare for a brutal battle			1
it seems perverse that a game , which pauses for tea , and has the possibility of not having a winner after a five day contest , can stir such fierce emotion			0
but for these two countries , thousands of miles apart , the yearning for victory could not be greater			0
rivalry it 's a rivalry which encompasses everything good , and sometimes bad , about sport			0
it 's about blood , guts , victory at all costs			0
but it 's also about respect , a love of the game and the realization that these two nations are forever intertwined through one of sports greatest and most dynamic rivalries			0
then there 's the history			0
there 's captain @entity55 discovering @entity6 in 1770 and the settling of @entity58 prisoners in @entity6 18 years later			2
add to that the brotherhood and bond between the two countries in time of war and the union of the @entity64			0
and why not throw a shared monarch into the mix too ? united by history , divided by sport			0
it 's one rivalry which threatens to remain eternal			0
so when when the players of @entity5 and @entity6 walk out at @entity72 , with the words of @entity75 's @entity74 ringing in their ears , they will know that the battle has begun			1
the @entity1 guide to understand the birth of this great rivalry requires a glance at the past			2
after enduring a dismal defeat by @entity6 on home soil at @entity87 in august 1882 , @entity84 cricket was left in a state of shock and embarrassment			1
a newspaper , the @entity90 , carried a satirical obituary of @entity84 cricket , which stated that : " the body will be cremated and the ashes taken back to @entity6			2
" when @entity5 traveled to @entity6 for the return series , it gained revenge with captain @entity96 awarded a small terracotta urn to symbolize the winning of the @entity1			1
that small urn is arguably the most precious prize in world cricket with @entity6 holding it on 31 occasions to @entity5 's 30			1
controversy there has been no shortage of drama during @entity1 encounters -- but some are better remembered than others , although not always for the right reasons			0
the most controversial @entity1 series remains that of 1932 - 33 , which was known as " @entity112 " after @entity5 captain @entity113 ordered his bowlers to bowl straight at the bodies of their opponents			1
it was a tactic which caused huge uproar , with @entity121 batsman @entity120 suffering a fractured skull as @entity5 's bowlers showed no mercy			2
a 4 - 1 defeat was difficult to take for @entity6 and enshrined an extra edge to an already intense rivalry			1
stars some of the most famous names in cricket have played in @entity132 matches -- but there are some which are synonymous with this particular battle			0
one of those is @entity138 , widely regarded as @entity5 's biggest @entity1 hero having had a test series named after him			1
" @entity144 " which took place in 1981 , produced one of the most spectacular moments ever witnessed in an @entity1 series			0
after resigning as captain just days earlier following an opening test defeat , @entity5 were on the cusp of going 2 - 0 down in the series			1
a dismal start to the second test at @entity153 left @entity6 tantalizingly close to victory -- but @entity138 's heroics defied all the odds			2
an unbeaten 149 from 148 deliveries gave @entity5 hope , forcing @entity6 to score 130 to win the match			1
but the tourists only managed 111 -- handing the victory to @entity5 , which eventually went on to win the series			1
@entity6 dominated between 1989 and 2003 -- winning eight consecutive series			1
the undisputed team of the decade in the 1990s and early 2000s , @entity6 boasted several world class players such as @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and brothers @entity169 and @entity171			1
then there was wicketkeeper @entity173 , who scored the second fastest century in test match cricket during @entity6 's 5 - 0 whitewash of @entity5 in 2006 - 7			1
but @entity6 's and indeed the world 's greatest ever batsman , is widely acknowledged to have been @entity179			2
' @entity179 ' scored 5,028 runs in @entity1 contests during his career from 1928 - 1948 and finished with an average of 99.94			0
@entity6 have also dominated with the ball with @entity166 the leading wicket taker in @entity1 cricket with 195 , while @entity167 claimed an impressive 157			1
recent history while , @entity5 might be favorites to win this series , it 's important to realize it was n't always this way			1
when the 2005 series came to @entity5 , @entity6 was hoping to win its ninth consecutive @entity1 series			1
a routine victory in the opening @entity195 appeared to confirm its status as favorite before a narrow two - run defeat at @entity199 drew @entity5 level			1
a crucial @entity5 victory at @entity72 in the fourth test , coming in between two drawn games , gave the host nation its first series win since 1989			1
it was the series which introduced @entity207 to the world stage and led to @entity209 establishing himself as favorite with cricket fans across the world			2
@entity209 's 24 wickets and 402 runs were integral to @entity5 's success but his next venture did not go so smoothly as he captained @entity5 during its tortuous 5 - 0 whitewash defeat in @entity6 in 2006/7			1
that result left a huge scar on @entity84 cricket as @entity6 humiliated its rival in ruthless fashion			2
but @entity5 bounced back in 2009 , winning the home series , before achieving its first victory on @entity121 soil in 24 years following a 3 - 1 win in 2010 - 11			1
the players for the players of both teams , playing in the @entity1 is the pinnacle			0
there is no greater honor for an @entity84 or @entity121 cricketer -- the stakes are at their highest and victory ensures sporting immortality			0
but where there are great gains to be made , there are also great losses which can be suffered			0
and while @entity6 may not be at its strongest , @entity5 is not taking anything for granted			1
" it 's a bit of a dream come true starting an @entity1 series at home in front of all your family and friends at @entity72 , " said @entity5 bowler @entity245 , who plays for @entity246			1
" but it 's all about winning , because if you lose , you look back at that match with horrible memories			2
but if you win , you have very fond memories , so it 's an advantage for us as a team			0
" you know what @entity121 are like			0
they are tough characters who love to win and you would be disappointed if they did n't come out with a lot of fight			0
" you 'd be disappointed if there was n't fire in their bellies in an @entity1 series anyway			0
" @entity6 might start the series as underdogs but its captain , @entity277 , is confident his players can provide a shock result			1
" i know especially back in @entity6 , this is the pinnacle of an @entity121 cricketer , to play @entity195 in @entity5 , be part of an @entity1 series and i 'm sure there will be judgments made on our performances , and as captain of the team you should be accountable , " said @entity277			1
" i 've said for a while now that we come here as underdogs but that has n't affected our preparation and it wo n't affect our performance either			0
" we know it 's going to be tough but i know our boys are up to the challenge			0
the fans @entity5 's cricket team enjoys unparallelled support in international cricket with is fans universally known as " the @entity301 "			2
created in 1994 by three friends , the " @entity301 " now boasts over 5,000 members and arranges tours across the world to watch @entity5 compete			1
singing , often accompanied by @entity306 , a classically trained trumpet player , adds some color , while the chanting can often provide some light entertainment -- unless you 're an @entity121			0
the @entity301 has a reputation for going after @entity6 's players with bowler @entity313 the unfortunate victim during the 2010 - 11 series			1
@entity6 's fans , known as ' @entity317 ' will be hoping to have something to shout about following two consecutive defeats			2
the two sets of supporters groups play a cricket match against each other during every series with @entity5 coming up on top this time around			1
where to watch the five test matches are taking place throughout @entity5 with the opening contest at @entity72 , @entity329			2
following that , the series will move to the @entity332 , lord 's , in @entity334 , before moving up to @entity335 , @entity336 and back to @entity334			0
the @entity337 ( @entity337 ) has agreed a deal for cricket fans living in mainland @entity340 and @entity341 to watch the series on @entity343			0
@entity344 while one captain cook changed the tide of history in 1770 , another is hoping he can make his own mark by putting @entity6 to the sword			2
@entity5 captain @entity351 enjoyed an outstanding 2010 - 11 series in @entity6 , scoring 766 runs			1
he has more than 7,500 runs to his name and is hoping to win the ashes for the first time since replacing @entity358 as captain			0
the host nation will also be relying on fast bowler @entity361 , who has emerged as one of the most talented players in world cricket			0
@entity361 , who is particularly adept at swinging the ball in either direction , has taken 307 test wickets in his career -- a number which ranks him joint - third in the all - time list of @entity5 bowlers			2
for @entity6 , much depends on the experience of captain @entity277 , who has only recently recovered from injury			2
in his 24 test matches as captain , he has excelled with the bat at an average of 66			0
end game ? @entity5 is the favorite to win its third consecutive @entity1 series -- a feat which not long ago would have sounded almost impossible given @entity6 's dominance in the 1990s			1
now , with @entity6 no longer the force it used to be , @entity5 expects			1
the pressure to deliver is on , the nation awaits the opportunity to taunt the old enemy once more			0
but whichever team comes out on top , the world will surely be treated to another epic encounter -- just weeks before both teams do it all over again , this time in @entity6			2
this is one obsession which wo n't be ending anytime soon			0
@entity121 cricket coach axed ahead of ashes			0

@entity5 and @entity6 will compete for @entity398 in a five - match series
@entity5 is favorite to triumph after winning the past two *editions*
@entity6 dominated during the 1990s and early 2000s
