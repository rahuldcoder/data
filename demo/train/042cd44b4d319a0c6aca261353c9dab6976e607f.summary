president @entity1 's new tax plan includes some sensible ideas			1
unfortunately , it would mean increasing taxes on saving and investment , which are key drivers of economic growth , according to various experts			1
on balance , i believe the plan moves in the wrong direction			0
the president 's proposal to boost the earned income tax credit for childless low - wage workers is a sensible step to strengthen the social safety net and encourage people to work			1
expanding the credit , an idea also put forward by @entity25 chairman @entity24 , @entity26 , would draw childless adults into the labor force and give them income support			0
the president is also proposing two supply - side measures that would reduce barriers to work			0
under today 's tax system , secondary earners often face high tax rates based on the couple 's combined earnings			1
that penalizes two - earner couples and discourages spouses from entering the work force			0
some supporters of the tax penalty see it as a way to strengthen their vision of traditional family values			0
but @entity50 should be free to choose their own family values , without interference from the tax system			2
@entity1 tax plan : middle - class credits , increases for rich the president 's plan would reduce the tax bias against two - earner couples by providing a second - earner credit and expanding the credit for child care costs			1
a bigger child care credit is particularly good tax policy			0
any tax system that taxes workers on their income should offer relief for work - related costs			0
child care costs are definitely work - related ; statistical studies confirm that the availability of cheaper child care promotes work by parents , particularly mothers			0
however , even as the president 's plan eases tax barriers to work , it introduces major obstacles to saving			1
the plan starts on the right track , with measures to make it easier for people to save at their workplaces			1
but it turns around and strikes a heavy blow against saving by taxing some capital gains at death and raising the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends			0
those proposals would amplify the income tax 's central flaw , its penalty on saving			1
people who earn wages and spend them immediately pay tax only on their wages			1
but those who earn wages , save and consume the proceeds in the future pay tax on both their wages and the returns on their saving			1
it does n't make sense to put heavier tax burdens on people who choose to save for the future rather than spend today , particularly when their savings finance the investments that drive the economy 's long - run growth			1
taxing capital gains at death could be a step forward if tax rates on capital gains and dividends were cut by enough to prevent an increase in the overall burden on saving			2
for that matter , the combination of taxing gains at death and raising the rates could be a step forward if it was offset by scaling back the corporate income tax , a particularly complicated and destructive levy on saving and investment			2
but that 's a far cry from what the president is proposing			0
his plan would leave the corporate income tax in place while taxing capital gains at death and increasing the top tax rate on gains and dividends by more than 4 percentage points ( on top of an increase of almost 9 percentage points in 2013 )			2
taxing the savings of " the 1 % " to finance tax cuts for the middle class may be good politics , but it 's a shortsighted approach that could undermine long - run economic growth			0
a better approach would have been to curtail the growth of entitlement benefits for those well above poverty and to limit tax breaks for expensive owner - occupied homes			0
the president has put forward some good ideas to help childless low - wage workers and ease the tax penalty on two - earner couples			2
but it would be a big mistake to pay for them by penalizing the saving and investment on which our economic future depends .			2

@entity177 : president @entity1 's plan to increase taxes on saving and investment may not be wise
@entity177 : it does n't make sense to put heavier tax burdens on people who choose to save for the future rather than spend today
