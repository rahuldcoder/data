the cloud over @entity18 does n't end there			1
a law enforcement source told @entity35 that @entity37 police are " very active " -- and making progress -- in trying to connect the dots that could link @entity18 to an unsolved drive - by shooting that left two people dead last summer in @entity37 's @entity42			1
in a related development , a silver sport utility vehicle owned by @entity18 that police believe is linked to that double homicide was impounded in @entity13 , a law enforcement source told @entity35			1
the @entity48 reports that the unsolved shooting deaths of two men might have played a role in the motive for @entity1 's death			1
the newspaper quoted two law enforcement officials as saying @entity1 may have had information linking @entity18 to the shooting			1
" the motive might have been that the victim knew ( @entity18 ) might have been involved , " the paper said , quoting one of the officials , who asked for anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation			1
for now , prosecutors contend that something @entity1 may have done or said did n't sit well with the @entity68 standout			1

on wednesday , the same day authorities showed up at @entity18 's door and took him away in a police car , 27 - year - old @entity72 was similarly arrested in @entity13 and charged as a fugitive from justice			1
@entity72 was in a @entity7 court friday			0
according to his attorney , @entity79 , @entity72 pleaded not guilty to a single charge of carrying a firearm without a license			1

he 'll remain behind bars until a july 9 hearing at which time @entity79 said he plans to press a judge to set bail			0

just so you know , " he texted his sister to let her know who he was with			0
about 3:25 a.m. -- two minutes after the message -- gunshots shattered the quiet night , according to witnesses			0
guns and bubblegum not five minutes passed before a surveillance camera captured video of @entity18 carrying a gun as he arrived back at his home , prosecutors said			2
police return to @entity18 's home he was with two other people			1
@entity1 was not among them			2
a murder weapon is usually a key piece of evidence in a homicide case , and investigators have not been able to find one			0
@entity18 at least once had a @entity160 , prosecutors said , entering a cell phone photo into evidence of him posing in the mirror with it			2
and police have seized .45 - caliber ammunition and an ammunition magazine that were in a @entity169 he drove and a condo he rented			0
@entity18 and the other two later took the car back to the rental company			1
there , the defendant offered an attendant a piece of blue @entity179 gum , prosecutors said			0
what appeared to be a piece of chewed blue gum was left lying inside the vehicle , prosecutors said			0
next to it was a spent .45 - caliber casing			0
the casing matches the empty shells @entity189 recovered near @entity1 's body , prosecutors said			2
if that gum was in @entity18 's mouth , dna tests will connect him to the casings , prosecutors said			2
when investigators inspected @entity1 's body , they found keys in his pockets to a rental car registered in @entity18 's name			1
opinion : @entity68 does n't have answers on @entity18 a fallen star @entity18 had been expected to be one of the keys to the @entity19 ' stellar offense , a vital cog on a team that many expected could contend for a @entity211 title			2
now he 's sitting in a @entity7 jail cell			0
