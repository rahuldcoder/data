to depart the long - running crime drama , as well as what she 'll miss , and whether she 'll ever come back			1
@entity0 : you say goodbye to the other members of the csi team in the last scene of your final episode			1
was that by design ? @entity4 : yeah			1
i had asked for that to be the last scene ' cause i knew it was gon na be a really intense scene and i just did n't want to play it before anything else			2
i do n't know if pressure is the right word , but i felt like a big bubble over my head , like , " this is an important day in my life			2
" it 's been such an incredible journey			1
i just wanted to make sure that ... i said the right things			2
@entity0 : how did you think it went ? helgenberger : i was really happy with the way it went			2
i mean , the scene , i had tweaked it			2
they had written it , but i tweaked it and they were okay with that			2
they said , " really , whatever you want to say			2
" my boyfriend said several times , " that was just really , really special			2
" i mean , i knew that i was probably not gon na feel that kind o ' love			2
i mean , who knows ? i hope to have another experience like that in my career , but that was a rare experience to end [ my time on ] the show that i still have enormous love for and respect for and pride and all of that			1
every time i 've like thought about that day and leaving , i well up			2
@entity68 had written this card for me with a polar bear on it -- a photograph of a polar bear			2
what she said in the card was so beautiful about how i 'm an endangered species and blah , blah , blah			2
it was just so moving			2
so i just feel so blessed to have had this experience all these years			2
@entity0 : were n't you supposed to leave last year ? helgenberger : well , it was originally supposed to be the end of last season			0
and @entity84 had kind of begged me			0
she said , " do you think there 's any way i can convince you to exit , not [ at ] the beginning of the next season , but into the next season ? i just think it 's better for the show , it 's better for you , you can get more attention			1
" i was open to it because i was n't exactly quite ready , but this time , i was			0
and i ca n't tell you how many times they tried to convince me to change my mind			1
i mean , even ' til the last night of shooting , they were just , " anytime you want to come back , and if we write this great episode , " and so on and so on			1
i just have to recharge my battery , step back , and reassess			1
it 's been a long time			1
@entity106 plays with your mind when you 're on a show like that			1
twelve years is a very long time			0
my son was 9 and he 's now 21 and he 's working in the production office			1
a day has n't gone by [ during ] which i did n't enjoy myself			0
i mean , there may have been certain locations that sucked , there might have been certain story lines that i did n't really like or the hours , whatever , but there was always something that happened during that day -- shooting day -- which made me laugh			0
i do n't leave going , " i got ta get out of this job			0
" @entity0 : but it was hard work , right ? helgenberger : oh my @entity124 , yes			0
in the first few seasons , there 'd be days that were like , 16 , 17 hours long			1
the killer thing about " csi , " especially in those first few years , is that it 's supposed to be the graveyard shift of this crime unit in @entity132			1
so it was so much at night and it just , three , four , five in the morning , in these ungodly locations			0
that scaled back , especially after season 5			1
i had it in my contract not to be worked after midnight , but then sometimes i would let it slide			0
@entity0 : think back to the making of the pilot			1
what were your initial thoughts about " csi " ? helgenberger : i just thought it was a really special 21st century @entity148			0
all the technology and science kinda was the star			0
and that had never really been , and that the criminalists became the heroes as opposed to cops or feds or whatever you had seen in series before			0
it felt effortless -- that 's a good word for it			1
and it just felt like , i 've done a series before , " @entity173 , " and you kinda know when there 's like chemistry on a pilot and you know when there 's chemistry all around and there 's a little magic dust sprinkled over something			1
@entity0 : how did you feel about @entity1 being an ex-stripper ? helgenberger : in the pilot she was described as a single mother and ex-stripper			0
but it was never really addressed			0
so the producers said , " you know , we 're just gon na do away with that backstory and we think she should come more out of like some sort of generic [ background ]			1
" i do n't even remember what they were pitching			0
i said no , i think that it really says a lot about who this woman is , ' cause it takes a lot to go from that kind of career to this completely different career			0
and so they acquiesced pretty easily			0
@entity0 : talk about when @entity196 left the show			1
helgenberger : i was very upset that he left			0
i mean , it was n't like i did n't see it coming , ' cause he had been wanting off the show for a while			1
he was pretty vocal about it			0
he can be a bit of a grump and we used to call him @entity209 , to his face , ' cause he just would always complain			0
not in an outrageous way , but he just always seemed to have a complaint or two or three about something or other , whether it was working too many hours or he did n't want to be in this scene or something			0
so it was clear that he was wanting to go , like , way before he even left			0
in fact , i was kind of surprised he stuck it out as long as he did			0
i think it was into the second season , possibly [ third ] , but in his trailer , there was like this molding or something and he started putting down the episodes , like he was kind of obsessed with how many episodes he was stuck having to do still			0
@entity0 : your thoughts on @entity233 ? helgenberger : it was a different show with @entity233 than it was with @entity196			1
in many ways , it kind of became a darker -- i do n't know if i want to say darker , ' cause there were plenty of dark episodes when @entity196 was around , but the character that they created for @entity233 was one in which he , initially -- i do n't know if he had a certain type of chromosome or something [ that ] he shared with people who have a trait to be serial killers or something like that			0
so you 're already stuck with a dark character , so where do you go from there ? but @entity233 is a very powerful actor , and i enjoyed working with him			1
@entity0 : and @entity256 ? helgenberger : i love working with @entity256			0
he 's just so -- well , i do n't know if this is the right way to describe it , but he 's so light and fun and loose , yet just a really solid actor			1
he 's really , really a good actor and just a great guy and quirky			1
he 's been a lot of fun this season			1
if i was really open to it , i definitely would have stayed because of @entity256			0
he 's just so easy to work with			1
@entity0 : so you 're open to coming back ? when ? helgenberger : well there are only nine episodes left , because they 're already shooting episode 13			1
so that would mean they 'd have to start figuring out a way to have me come back now , after this big arc i just had			1
i just have to , like i said , regroup			0
