@entity0 -- @entity2 wants to hear your life story			1
not satisfied with just being a repository for recent vacation photos , the company is revamping the profile pages on its website to better highlight the milestones in a person 's life , executives announced at its annual conference for software developers on thursday			1
this new version is based around the idea of a personal " timeline " rather than the standard profile pages that users have become used to			1
" we 're more than what we did just recently , " ceo @entity21 said in unveiling the new look			2
" timeline is a completely new aesthetic for @entity2			1
" the pages look more like blogs than a social - networking site			1
a large photo covers the top of the pages , stretching from one side of the screen to the other			0
and posts -- like photos , status updates and the locations a person visits -- show up below that , attached to a vertical and chronological timeline			0
@entity2 is hoping the changes encourage people to publish more information about their daily lives and about their pasts			2
in his onstage demonstration , @entity21 posted a baby picture of himself , which showed up at the bottom of his timeline profile			1
" we think it 's an important next step to help you tell the story of your life , " he said			0
some users got a beta version starting on thursday , while others will be able to request access			2
the new profile will be turned on for everyone in the next few months , according to @entity64 , @entity2 's technology chief			2
the world 's largest social network , with more than 750 million users , introduced some related new features earlier this week			1
@entity21 said @entity2 's reach continues to grow			1
" for the first time ever , in a single day we had half a billion people use @entity2 , " he said			1
the company made a second big announcement thursday when it unveiled a new version of its app network , which also is launching in the coming weeks			0
@entity2 will make it easier for people to post info to their profile pages without visiting the site or clicking a like button			1
the company has partnered with dozens of prominent software developers for applications that integrate more closely with the social network			0
some of these features launched on thursday			2
this is " the most significant change we 've made to our platform since we launched it four years ago , " @entity64 said			0
streaming music services , including @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 , can automatically send data to @entity2 about each song a user listens to or about new playlists			2
these might then show up as a weekly report on the user 's facebook page			0
@entity21 called this " real - time serendipity			1
" " this rings the friction out of how to share music , " @entity107 , @entity96 's content chief , said in an interview			0
to promote this real - time sharing , @entity2 also announced partnerships with @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , foodie social network @entity116 and others			1
these companies have created @entity2 apps that can post all of a person 's activities on @entity2 's new " ticker , " which appears in the top right - hand corner of the site 's homepage			1
some video services will similarly be able to notify @entity2 each time a user watches a video			1
@entity115 , the tv streaming site , and @entity114 , the paid subscription service , will be among the first to adopt the new features			2
@entity114 ceo @entity133 , who is also on @entity2 's board of directors , said that in some cases , @entity2 friend recommendations can trump @entity114 's vaunted algorithms			2
@entity114 's @entity2 features will be activated in 44 countries but not in the @entity139 because of a law that @entity133 described as outdated			1
" you do n't have to like a movie , " @entity21 said			2
" you just watch a movie			0
" miscellaneous apps like @entity146 + and recipe sites also will be able to send more info about particular runs or dinner concoctions without asking each time			0
" i 'm not going to publish a status update every time i walk up to my stove , " said @entity64 , the @entity2 cto who is also an avid cook			1
" i do n't want to spam my friend 's news feed every time i pick up a spatula			0
" news websites and apps will ask readers to sign in with their @entity2 accounts so that they can send info to the social network about every article they read			1
for the news industry , " it 's huge , " said @entity165 , the ceo of @entity166 , which integrated some of these features into its web browser			0
" it gives a more tailored view			0
" but @entity175 , a news aggregation app for @entity177 that is listed among @entity2 's first partners , decided not to adopt that particular feature because , according to a spokeswoman , users probably would n't want to share so much information			1
instead , users of the apps will be able to highlight individual articles using the like button , as they currently can , or also share sections to their profiles , she said			2
the new @entity2 features could anger privacy advocates			1
with these changes , @entity2 is seeking significantly more data about people 's activity online and about their personal lives			0
some internet users who were watching thursday 's presentation online reacted negatively			0
" get ready for over-sharing , " one @entity200 user wrote			0
" this is just way too much sharing			0
the end of privacy , " a @entity2 user wrote on the company 's live stream page			0
@entity2 is hoping to alleviate these concerns during a " slow rollout , " @entity2 's @entity64 said in an interview with reporters after the announcement			0
the company worked with privacy groups during the development of these features , he said			0
" this is actually a major step for transparency and control on @entity2 , " @entity64 said			0
users will be able to delete individual items after they 've been posted , he added			0
@entity21 has said he believes @entity223 users will continue sharing significantly more of their lives online each year			1
comedian @entity225 , who opened thursday 's event with his familiar " @entity229 " impersonation of the hoodied @entity2 founder , poked fun at this idea in a brief introductory routine .			1

@entity21 : " timeline is a completely new aesthetic for @entity2 "
new timeline pages look more like blogs than a social - networking site
another change will let @entity2 users share activities with friends " in real time "
