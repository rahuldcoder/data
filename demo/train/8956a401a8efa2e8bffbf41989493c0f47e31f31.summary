-- on december 15 , 2013 , teachers @entity1 and @entity3 rolled to a stop after what 's likely to be a @entity7 - setting 42,120 kilometer journey around the globe			1
the 16 - month trip , which took them through 39 countries , is impressive in itself			1
that they did it on a three - wheeled tuk tuk -- the ubiquitous urban transport solution in many parts of @entity17 -- makes their story remarkable			1
starting from the @entity21 in @entity22 on august 13 , 2012 , the expedition took them through southern @entity24 to @entity25 , where they crossed into @entity27 and drove down @entity28			1
from @entity28 , they shipped the tuk tuk to @entity31 , where they resumed their journey through @entity17			1
from @entity35 they shipped the rickshaw to @entity37 , then did a loop of @entity39 -- nearly having to give up due to mechanical issues -- before reaching the finish line in @entity42 last month			2
the men say they overtook the current world record for the longest journey in an auto - rickshaw and are now waiting for @entity7 to officially validate it , a process that can take a few months			1
here , the pair recaps some of the highs and lows of the journey and why they did it			0
@entity0 : what was the motivation behind this adventure ? @entity1 : one of the key things we are doing is promoting awareness of world education problems			1
as @entity62 © as it sounds , the idea was hatched after teaching and traveling abroad and seeing the amazing work of the local people who are working to find innovative ways to provide an education to children in their communities			2
in 2000 , the 189 @entity70 member states and 23 international organizations made promises with the @entity73 that every primary aged child in the world would have access to education by 2015			1
this is going to fail miserably			0
there are still 57 million primary aged children who are out of school and countless more who lack a quality education , either through number of kids in the classroom or other factors			2
@entity0 : why a tuk tuk ? @entity1 : the tuk tuk as a small , open - sided vehicle is iconic for many of the countries we have traveled though			1
there was never any doubt that it would be a tuk tuk			1
loads of people drive and cycle their way around the world , which in many ways is more impressive than what we 've done			2
but we wanted to stick out like a sore thumb , so that people would take notice			0
also , no one had driven the length of @entity28 or around the world in a tuk tuk , and there was a world record on offer , so it was the perfect vehicle for our goals			1
it helped that we were both pretty obsessed with tuk tuks and just loved being in them when we were traveling			2
@entity0 : how would you rate the overall comfort of long distance tuk tuk travel ? @entity1 : tuk tuks are built for city travel and for this they are perfect			1
we have found that they are not so good driving in long straight lines ( ours had a max speed of 50 km / h ) , high altitude ( does n't start ) , thick mud and sand ( back wheels do n't rotate ) and roads that are n't sealed ( no suspension in the back two wheels )			0
@entity0 : what were the best and worst places to travel with a tuk tuk ? @entity1 : this is a tough question			1
often the best places from a reaction point of view are the places that do n't have tuk tuks , or that do but do n't have many			2
with this in mind , we got the best reactions from people in @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0
i would say that @entity28 was the real highlight for us ( even though at times it was very challenging )			0
likewise , though the heat and humidity of @entity31 made life very uncomfortable , it 's an amazingly interesting assault on the senses -- driving is like a real life computer game			0
generally , the most boring times are long straight roads that go on for days with not much scenery to look at ! @entity0 : easiest and toughest border crossings ? @entity1 : we adopted the attitude of " we have all the correct paper work ( most of the time ) and we are going to stay here until you let us through			1
" many countries do say , " sorry we do n't let tuk tuks cross this border , " but they normally give way after a couple of hours			1
what 's challenging is getting through customs when you ship the tuk tuk			1
we spent days / weeks in customs in both @entity27 and @entity179			1
we just had to be patient ( or at least smile and pretend to be )			0
more : @entity181 tuk tuk driver confessions @entity0 : was safety ever an issue ? @entity1 : we actually feel that the tuk tuk is a pretty safe vehicle			1
we could n't go very fast which meant unless one of us fell asleep at the wheel a head on collision was pretty unlikely			0
we did get bundled off the road a lot and no one respected us , but you can deal with that			0
what we could n't control was stuff driving into the back of us			0
this occurred in @entity201 when a guy was coming onto the main road via a slip road and looking over his shoulder			0
he slammed into the back of us , knocking us sideways into the fast lane , but luckily there was nothing coming			0

i think that my next ( much shorter ) adventure is going to be on a tandem bicycle			0
@entity0 : did you raise any money during the trip ? @entity3 : our main aim is to raise awareness -- about the educational challenges facing the world today and for the @entity230			1
we are raising money too though to support grassroots education projects that we 've visited throughout our journey			1
we 're supporting these small projects , set up and run by local people , through our @entity237 registered charity , the @entity236 , where 100 % of donations go directly to the projects			0
this process has started , and will be our focus from now on			0
people can support projects ( donating to or fundraising for those that may particularly appeal to them ) through our website www.tuktuktravels.com/projects			0
@entity0 : how did you pay for the journey ? @entity3 : the journey itself ( totally separate from our charity ) was funded by ourselves with the support of some sponsors and partners , including @entity257 and @entity258			2
we could n't have done it without their kindness and support			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you two ? @entity1 : to wrap up this project we will both be doing school talks around the @entity237 for a few months			2
we will also be working on a book and trying to find people to work with us on our travel / education documentary that we would like to release in 2015 when , ideally , the @entity73 are supposed to be realized			2
after that we are n't sure			0
we both still want to work in some capacity in development and education			2
@entity214 is unlikely to go back into teaching -- probably focusing more on the business side of education			0
i miss being in the classroom and the community aspects of school life so depending on what turns up i might well head straight back into teaching			0
