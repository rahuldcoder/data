military veterans are dying needlessly because of long waits and delayed care at @entity6 veterans hospitals , a @entity1 investigation has found			1
what 's worse , the @entity6 @entity7 is aware of the problems and has done almost nothing to effectively prevent veterans dying from delays in care , according to documents obtained by @entity1 and interviews with numerous experts			1
the problem has been especially dire at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20			0
there , veterans waiting months for simple gastrointestinal procedures -- such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy -- have been dying because their cancers are n't caught in time			2
the @entity27 has confirmed six deaths at @entity29 tied to delays			2
but sources close to the investigation say the number of veterans dead or dying of cancer because they had to wait too long for diagnosis or treatment at this facility could be more than 20			1
" it 's very sad , because people died , " said dr. @entity40 , a private physician specializing in colonoscopies in @entity19			2
@entity40 and other physicians across @entity20 's capital city are being affected by the delays at @entity29 as veterans seek treatment or diagnoses outside the @entity27			1
@entity40 is one of the few doctors in the area willing to speak on the record about the situation at @entity29			0
" ( veterans ) paid the ultimate price , " he said			2
" people that had appointments had their appointments canceled and rescheduled much later			0
... in some cases , that made an impact where they went into a later stage ( of illness ) and therefore lost the battle to live			0
" @entity67 , a 63 - year - old @entity68 veteran , said he was told by staff members at @entity70 this year that he did n't need a colonoscopy			0
instead , he said , they gave him a routine test that would show whether he had polyps that are cancerous or in danger of becoming cancerous			0
sessions said the @entity27 told him to return in several years			2
thanks for your service , vets ! now try finding a job but he ignored that advice and had a colonoscopy in the office of his private physician , @entity40			0
in that procedure , @entity40 found and removed four polyps			0
two of those polyps were pre-cancerous , the physician said			0
had sessions waited another few years , @entity40 said , he could have had colon cancer			0
" there is a little problem that the @entity27 had , " @entity67 said			2
" my feeling is , the @entity27 is not doing their ' pre-stuff ' that they should do to protect the veterans			1
" what happened at the @entity29 hospital , however , was not just an oversight by the hospital			0
government documents obtained exclusively by @entity1 and not made public show that the hospital knew that its growing waiting list and delays in care were having deadly consequences			1
medical investigators reviewed the cases of 280 gastrointestinal cancer patients at @entity29 and found that 52 were " associated with a delay in diagnosis and treatment			0
" the government documents @entity1 obtained illustrate just how bad delays at @entity29 got : in may 2011 , a patient was brought into the emergency room needing urgent care after suffering multiple delays , and the documents state " that was the facility 's first realization that patients were ' falling through the cracks			1
' " another veteran had to wait nine months for a colonoscopy -- " a significant delay , " according to @entity27 records , that " would have impacted the stage at which he was diagnosed			2
" the record indicates that by the time this veteran had surgery , his cancer was at stage 3			0
still another patient recommended for possible disease of the esophagus had to wait four months for an appointment and 11 months for an endoscopy , at which time he learned that he had later - stage esophageal cancer			0
the internal @entity27 report says that without the delay , " his cancer would have been diagnosed much earlier			2
" and though the report does n't not say whether the veteran died , it does say that an earlier screening would have provided earlier detection " with better survival			0
" in july 2011 , a hospital physician sent a warning to administrators that the backlog for @entity158 patients ' gastrointestinal appointments had reached 2,500 , and patients were waiting eight months -- until february 2012 -- for appointments			0
by december 2011 , the documents show , the backlog at @entity29 had grown to 3,800 patients , according to another warning e-mail from a physician			1
read the full @entity27 investigation board report ( @entity167 ) @entity168 was done to effectively resolve the problems , according to expert sources and documents			1
in september 2013 , the @entity27 's inspector general affirmed details of the delays at @entity29 in stark language , stating that 700 of the delays for appointments or care were " critical			1
" read the full @entity180 report on @entity158 ( @entity167 ) perhaps most troubling of all is that the problem at the @entity29 facility had been identified , and taxpayer money was given to fix the problem in september 2011			0
" we appropriated a million dollars ( to @entity158 ) because @entity27 asked for it , " said rep. @entity185 , @entity186 , chairman of the @entity187			2
the documents obtained by @entity1 show that only a third of that $ 1 million from @entity192 was used for its intended purpose at @entity158 : to pay for care for veterans on a waiting list			1
the @entity27 " will say , ' we redirected those dollars to go somewhere it was needed , ' " @entity185 said			2
" where would it be more needed than to prevent the deaths of veterans ? " at the same time , the documents show , the waiting list at @entity29 kept growing to 3,800 patients in december 2011			1
" these are real people that we 're talking about , that are being harmed -- either made sick , will be sick in the future or have died , " @entity185 said			0
documents and interviews show that the problem goes beyond delayed colonoscopies and other gastrointestinal procedures at @entity29			1
@entity1 has learned from documents and interviews that other @entity27 facilities have been under scrutiny by officials over possible delays in treatment or diagnoses			1
shortly before @entity1 published this report , the @entity27 acknowledged that there have been concerns about delay of care at some of its facilities			1
at the @entity228 in @entity229 , @entity230 , the @entity27 said three veterans died as a result of delayed care			1
@entity235 documents at that facility showed a waiting list of 4,500 patients			2
the @entity27 also acknowledged that it investigated delays at facilities in @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 , @entity244			2
the @entity27 said no " adverse outcomes " because of delays were found at the @entity27 centers in @entity242 and @entity244			1
homeless vet in makeover video has long road ahead @entity1 also has learned that , though little publicized , the problem is not new			1
" long wait times and a weak scheduling policy and process have been persistent problems for the @entity27 , and both the @entity253 and the @entity27 's ( inspector general ) have been reporting on these issues for more than a decade , " said @entity252 of the @entity253			1
@entity252 's office has been reporting to @entity192 on the delays in care at the @entity27 for years			1
it is so bad , she said , that she and her staff have found evidence that @entity27 hospitals have tried to cover up wait times , fudge numbers and backdate delayed appointments in an effort to make things appear better than they are			1
she says that just getting someone to pick up the phone to make an appointment at a @entity27 can be difficult			2
and getting a detailed picture of the problem is nearly impossible , she said			0
" it 's unclear how long it is being delayed , because no one can really give you accurate information , " @entity252 said			1
despite numerous reports and subsequent recommendations by the @entity253 , the problems with delays persist at @entity27 hospitals , @entity252 and other experts say			1
what veterans want you to know about military service " nothing has been implemented that we know of at this point , " @entity252 said			0
" we 've reported similar things , as well as the inspector general has reported similar findings ... for over a decade			0
" in fact , time and time again , even at hospitals where veterans died waiting for care , administrators got bonuses , not demotions , according to congressional investigators			1
the @entity187 has created a website devoted to what investigators say shows ongoing problems at the @entity27 , but the rewards system that @entity185 says is in place seems to encourage those problems			1
@entity1 's repeated requests for interviews with the @entity27 have been denied			1
even @entity192 has had its requests for information ignored , @entity185 said			0
" but unfortunately , if they treat members of @entity192 ... this way , imagine how they treat the average veteran out there , " said @entity185			0
" i can imagine the grief they may be going through			0
" the @entity27 said in a statement to @entity1 , " the @entity7 is committed to providing the best quality , safe and effective health care our veterans have earned and deserve			1
we take seriously any issue that occurs at one of the more than 1,700 health care facilities across the country			0
the consult delay at @entity331 has been resolved			0
" the statement added that cases are now tracked daily , and additional staff members were hired			0
but sources at @entity29 -- both patients and medical staff -- tell @entity1 that 's just not true			1
the problems continue , and veterans are still facing delays that could be killing them			2
