@entity0 -- as diplomats in @entity5 discuss reopening the investigation into a string of unsolved kidnappings of @entity10 citizens by @entity11 , the families of those abducted anxiously wait and hope			1
for years , they 've been seeking answers in the mysterious disappearance of their loved ones			2
the bulk of the abductions took place nearly four decades ago and the families of those taken have endured the agony of uncertainty , never knowing what truly transpired			0
with talks between @entity0 and @entity29 that took place on tuesday in the @entity32 capital , those left behind to wonder what happened to their disappeared relatives are hopeful that they will finally get some answers			1
spate of abductions according to the @entity10 government , @entity11 operatives kidnapped at least 17 @entity10 citizens in the late 1970 's and early 1980 's , possibly dozens more			1
some were kidnapped alone , while walking to and from school			0
others were taken in pairs while out on dates , including a couple snatched from the beach after walking to see the sunset			0
in 2002 , @entity11 admitted to the kidnappings for the first time but allowed only five abduction victims to return home to @entity10			1
information on the remaining 12 was sketchy at best			0
one victim 's story one of those still missing is @entity56 , who disappeared from @entity0 on june 12 , 1978			1
the 22 - year - old divorced single mother was working nights as a hostess at @entity0 's @entity60 , which remains open 36 years later			0
" when ( @entity56 ) disappeared , we thought she just quit and left , " says general manager @entity61 , who has worked there for over 50 years			1
" things like that happened a lot so we never would have thought that she had been abducted			0
" at the time , @entity61 did n't know that @entity11 operatives were canvassing the cabaret , a fact police later disclosed to @entity56 's older brother , @entity69			1
ideal candidate " at the time , @entity11 had a specific agenda , ( and ) abducted people that would further this agenda , " @entity69 said			1
" @entity56 was thought to have known everything that was needed to know about being a @entity10 woman ; she had experienced marriage and childbirth , and knew about cosmetics and feminine magazines and other trends at the time			1
at the time , being 22 years old , she had been singled out			0
" @entity69 did n't know the truth about his sister 's abduction for nearly a decade			0
he and his wife adopted her son , @entity87 , and told him they were his real parents			0
her daughter was adopted by another couple , and has never spoken publicly about the situation			0
" i promised myself when her son turned twenty , i would tell him the truth , " @entity69 says			0
@entity95 revealed but in 1987 , the bombing of a @entity11 airliner revealed the truth			2
115 people died when @entity99 exploded in mid-air , and a @entity11 spy , @entity101 , was arrested			2
she confessed to planting a bomb on the plane , and also revealed the biggest clue yet in @entity56 's disappearance			1
" after the bombing , ( @entity101 ) testified that she was trained by a @entity10 woman , " @entity69 says			2
" @entity108 thoroughly investigated and found her teacher was my sister			0
" it was later revealed that @entity11 agents abducted @entity56 and took her to @entity11 by boat			1
" i feel anger and hate i ca n't put into words , " @entity69 says			0
" why would she be taken ( to @entity11 ) ? she was a hard - working single mother who never did anything wrong			2
" the @entity10 government says @entity11 claims @entity56 died in a car accident in 1986 , but has n't provided proof , according to her son			1
alive or dead ? " the evidence given by @entity11 was questionable , " the younger @entity69 says			2
" there is no clear proof that she 's dead			0
there were no names on the documents submitted			0
" there is no clear , accurate proof			0
@entity11 said that she passed away on june 29th , 1986 but there are witnesses that say that she 's still alive			1
" he believes his mother is still alive and is hopeful renewed talks in @entity5 between @entity10 and @entity11 could bring answers about his mother			1
but he fears the @entity11 wo n't be truthful and wo n't allow his mother to leave , because she knows too much about the secret training of @entity11 spies			2
' i just want to come home ' former abductees told @entity56 's brother and son she 's still alive and they say she begged to go home , often weeping for her children			1

i only have an image in my head			0
