-- will placing a tea bag on a cold sore make it disappear ? can you ease hot flashes with herbs ? and does putting yogurt on your nether parts have a prayer of curing a yeast infection ? it used to be that you 'd hear about these kinds of home remedies from your mom			1
these days , they 're touted on websites , blogs , and online forums			0
in fact , 61 percent of @entity20 adults turn to the @entity22 to find help in treating what 's ailing them , a 2009 study reveals			1
but do these natural moves actually work ... and , just as important , could they do more harm than good ? @entity28 asked medical experts to weigh in on the @entity22 's most popular home cures			1
the online claim : yogurt can stop a yeast infection is it true ? no yeast infections -- and their symptoms , from intense vaginal itchiness to cottage cheese - like discharge -- are caused by an overgrowth of the fungus candida			1
because studies show that yogurt can promote the growth of healthier strains of bacteria in the stomach and intestines , people have long assumed it might also keep candida in check			1
and that rumor keeps circulating , thanks to the @entity22			1
unfortunately , " no study shows conclusively that eating yogurt cures or even lessens the severity of yeast infections , " says @entity55 , @entity56 , professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the @entity59 at @entity60			1
neither will douching with yogurt , or ( yikes ! ) dipping a tampon in the stuff , freezing it , and inserting it -- a remedy suggested on some websites			1
in fact , douching can cause yeast infections , @entity74 says , especially if you 're using yogurt ; its sugars could actually help yeast grow			1
if you 're sure you have a yeast infection , based on a past experience , @entity74 recommends using an over-the - counter medication , such as @entity82			1
but , she points out , " everything that itches is not yeast ! " so see your gyno when in doubt : that itching might actually be bacterial vaginosis , for instance , which requires treatment with antibiotics			2
@entity0 : is vaginal grooming safe ? the online claim : black cohosh eases hot flashes is it true ? yes commonly known as bugwort or rattle root , this herb is derived from a plant called @entity102			2
while it may sound like something from @entity106 's wizarding world , this remedy is not all hocus - pocus : some studies suggest that black cohosh may indeed reduce hot flashes , according to guidelines re-released last year by the @entity110			1
" it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect , " says @entity111 , @entity56 , co-editor of the " @entity112			0
" in fact , the herb is often prescribed in @entity117 ; it 's a key ingredient in @entity102 , a popular drug there , which is also available in the @entity20			1
while @entity20 studies have n't conclusively proven that black cohosh works , @entity74 says it ca n't hurt to try the herb -- just consult with your doctor about the dosage first , and stick with it for 12 weeks , she says			1
( make sure you 're getting black cohosh , not blue cohosh , which could potentially be harmful , she adds			2
) @entity0 : can supplements ease menopause symptoms ? the online claim : pop calcium pills to quell @entity135 cramps is it true ? yes since there 's scientific evidence that @entity135 sufferers have lower levels of calcium in their blood , it 's not a stretch to think that loading up on it would ease the cramps , headaches , and bloating that come at that time of the month			2
indeed , research has shown that taking 600 milligrams of calcium twice a day can reduce @entity135 symptoms			0
and getting the nutrient in your food ( such as calcium - packed dairy ) may keep them at bay altogether : in a recent study conducted at the @entity163 , @entity164 , women who consumed four servings a day of skim or low - fat milk reduced their risk of developing @entity135 by 46 %			0
note : some women 's cramps are so severe that only prescription medication can curb them , @entity74 says			2
so if calcium does n't make a difference with yours , see your doctor			2
@entity0 : 10 ways to get rid of @entity135 the online claim : tea tree oil can zap your zits is it true ? maybe one brand of tea tree oil sold online is dubbed " @entity184 , " and it just may be , at least in the case of acne			2
a study published in the @entity186 found that applying the extract to pimples reduced inflammation			0
" tea tree oil is antifungal and antibacterial , " says @entity190 , @entity56 , a @entity191 - based dermatologist			2
" it 's so effective that many of my patients prefer it to benzoyl peroxide			2
" other experts are not so keen			2
" the oil can cause rashes and even blistering , " warns @entity200 , @entity56 , assistant clinical professor of dermatology at @entity202 in @entity203 and the author of " your skin from a to @entity207 " if you 're nervous about using tea tree oil , @entity190 says , instead try a face wash for oily skin that contains salicylic or glycolic acid			0
@entity0 : get flawless skin naturally the online claim : steam clears up sinus headaches is it true ? yes this old - school treatment -- touted in more than 400,000 @entity222 results ! -- really works			0
" inhaling steam flushes out your nasal passages , relieving sinus pressure , " explains @entity223 , @entity56 , head of research at the @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227			0
add a few drops of peppermint or eucalyptus oil to make it more potent			0
" the minty smell causes a tingling sensation in the nasal membrane , and this has a decongestant effect , " says @entity223 , who also suggests dabbing @entity236 at the lower rim of your nostrils			0
another natural alternative : using a neti pot to irrigate the nostrils with saline solution , which can also ease sinus symptoms , according to one study			0
@entity0 : 10 products to help you find sinus relief the online claim : black tea bags help cold sores disappear is it true ? no if left alone , cold sores usually clear up in a few weeks -- but who wants to wait ? online remedies for the blisters range from the absurd ( like earwax ) to the less silly , like placing a damp black tea bag on the sore			1
" black tea leaves have tannins , compounds that may inhibit the growth of viruses and bacteria , but no studies have verified this , " @entity111 says			1
tea bags may also have an anti-inflammatory effect , he says			1
but your best bet to shorten healing time is an @entity278 treatment like @entity279 or a prescription med like @entity281			0
to prevent sores from popping up , stay out of the sun , and use a high - @entity285 sunscreen around your lips : " sun - light can trigger cold sores if you 're prone to them , " @entity111 says			1
@entity0 : the healing power of tea the online claim : drinking cranberry juice prevents @entity295 is it true ? yes this popular home cure is n't just an old wives ' tale : major medical institutions , including the @entity301 , agree that drinking cranberry juice can be effective for treating urinary tract infections ( @entity304 )			1
" the berries contain proanthocyanidins , which keep @entity307 from attaching to the bladder wall and causing an infection , " @entity111 says			0
if you 're prone to @entity304 , drink one to two glasses of cranberry juice daily to help prevent them			0
doing so also works when you have symptoms -- like a constant need to pee , or a burning sensation when you do -- to speed recovery			0
( there 's also evidence that peeing immediately after sex can help prevent utis by flushing out bacteria			0
) stick to juice that 's at least 20 % pure cranberry -- or try supplements , taking up to six 400 - milligram pills twice a day an hour before or two hours after a meal			0
if your symptoms do n't end within 24 to 48 hours , see your physician -- especially if you have a fever or chills			0
" that points to something serious , " @entity111 says , " and means you should not be messing with a home remedy			0

yogurt does n't cure yeast infests , nor does black tea bags help cold sores disappear
