the tanking @entity1 economy seems to be doing little to encourage president @entity2 to repair relations with the @entity4			1
in fact , @entity2 is slipping deeper into a revisionist @entity7 mindset , sending the worst @entity9 standoff in decades into a potentially more dangerous phase			2
with @entity1 's economy on the verge of collapse , @entity2 could have used his annual marathon news conference on thursday to show flexibility over @entity16 and to raise the prospect of relief from @entity20 sanctions			1
but instead , in powerful rhetoric , he dug in , comparing @entity1 to a " bear " that the @entity23 and its allies are determined to chain down before ripping out " its teeth and claws			2
" his comments solidified a cycle of escalating confrontation and recrimination which will see the year end with @entity23 - @entity1 relations at their lowest point since the fall of the @entity37			2
and there is no sign that things will improve in 2015			0
that 's a problem for president @entity42 , who is holding a year - end press conference on friday at which global issues like the tension with @entity1 will likely come up			1
@entity42 would rather concentrate on foreign policy crises elsewhere			2
though @entity1 is not the @entity7 superpower it once was , it ca n't be ignored : it has 1,600 deployed nuclear warheads and casts a huge geopolitical shadow in @entity52			2
@entity53 can also thwart @entity23 foreign policy goals vital to @entity42 's legacy in @entity56 , the @entity57 and beyond			1
the @entity58 responded to @entity2 's news conference by saying that @entity2 's " revisionist narrative " was troubling " but utterly unconvincing			1
" " president @entity2 has repeatedly attempted to shift blame of the conflict in @entity16 and the internal problems that @entity1 is experiencing away from his own policies , " @entity58 spokesman @entity61 said			1
@entity42 , meanwhile , risked further irking the @entity1 leader by signing a bill that gives @entity42 the power to impose new sanctions on @entity53 , though he does not plan to do so right away			1
despite @entity2 's defiance , the @entity58 is convinced that @entity23 and @entity52 sanctions on @entity1 , combined with steep drops in the price of oil , are sending the economy into a tailspin that @entity2 ca n't ignore			1
@entity20 officials hope that will persuade @entity2 that the price of his annexation of @entity82 and support for separatists in @entity16 is now too great			2
they reason the economic crunch could turn @entity1 's middle classes against @entity2 despite his current popularity , or prompt oligarchs cut off from @entity20 banks to force his hand			1
as panic hit @entity1 's financial markets this week , the central bank was forced into a hurried intervention to hike interest rates to 17 percent and the government stepped in amid fears of a disastrous run on the banks			1
this stemmed the bleeding but the ruble has still lost more than 50 % against the dollar this year , leaving the @entity103 in a bind			0
" they are between a rock and a hard place , " said @entity105 , chairman of president @entity42 's @entity106 , adding that the @entity1 economy was " on the brink of crisis			1
" but there is a chance that @entity2 could respond not by offering concessions , as the @entity4 hopes , but by stoking nationalism and shows of @entity53 's military power not seen since the @entity7			1
trying to prove it 's still a global power , the @entity103 has sent its warplanes and ships to test @entity124 defenses			0
@entity125 expressed outrage last week , saying a @entity1 military plane with its transponder turned off narrowly missed colliding with a @entity130 airliner			2
@entity1 officials , meanwhile , are accusing the @entity4 of plotting regime change in @entity53			2
despite rising tensions , some of @entity42 's critics , like @entity137 sen. @entity136 , want him to supply arms to @entity16 , a step the administration fears would not much help forces vastly outnumbered by @entity1 's military			1
" the argument that i hear from the administration is that we do n't want to provoke @entity2			0
that is just orwellian ... history will judge this administration incredibly harshly , " @entity136 told @entity148 in an interview			0
" the only thing that will dissuade @entity2 from what he is doing is when coffins come back to the families in @entity1			1
" the administration is concerned that imposing more @entity23 sanctions unilaterally could fracture the united front with @entity52 , which has much greater exposure to the @entity1 economy			0
@entity52 has generally been more reluctant to maintain sanctions than @entity163 , and some experts believe one @entity1 tactic could be to pull back forces from @entity16 's border and back peace talks between @entity169 and separatists to further soften @entity52 resolve			2
@entity23 officials and western @entity1 experts are also anxious about @entity2 's state of mind			1
people who have met and studied him argue that his strategic choices are distilled from a worldview that insists the @entity4 is depriving @entity1 of its rightful role as a great power			0
" we are concerned that the frame just does n't seem to track with events on the ground , " said a senior administration official			0
" that 's one of the reasons why world leaders do continue to reach out and talk to appropriate @entity1 interlocutors , " the official said			2
" it is a matter of concern			0
" in a phone call in march , @entity192 chancellor @entity191 told @entity42 she questioned whether the former @entity195 agent was in touch with reality			0
he is " in another world , " she said , according to the @entity199			0
@entity200 , a @entity201 scholar and author of an acclaimed book on @entity2 , says the @entity1 leader 's anti-western instincts have hardened since he returned to the @entity103 as president in 2012			1
" @entity2 projects onto us the kind of actions he would take â€” believing that the @entity211 @entity7 operations are still in place			0
he understands the world from a different vantage point			0
he is acting within that on the assumption that we are at war			0
" @entity42 , already beset by foreign policy problems , has no desire for a new @entity7 and says @entity1 's actions are simply not in its own interests			1
but the world looks a lot different to @entity53			0
" this insistence that @entity1 is headed in a disastrous direction , that @entity2 needs to recognize that and reverse course implies an expectation that at some point , @entity2 will realize that and give in to the @entity4 's pressure over @entity16 " said @entity224 of the @entity225			1
" he has sent implicit and explicit messages to the @entity4 that that is not going to happen			0
" along with sanctions , the @entity4 hopes another , more personal tactic will break @entity2 's resolve -- depriving him of the recognition he craves of the world stage			1
@entity2 left the @entity241 summit in @entity242 last month after he was given the cold shoulder by many world leaders in a nation still mourning 28 @entity246 among the dead when a @entity249 plane was shot down over rebel - held @entity16 in july			0
" i think they are getting the message , " the senior official said			0
" @entity2 got it very clearly			0
his body language was quite clear			0
