-- to ease the heartache of her first child 's stillbirth , @entity1 chose rigorous exercise , yoga and meditation over the antidepressants and sleeping pills that her physicians immediately suggested			1
" ' you need to be on this medication or that medication			2
' it was shocking to me that that was the first line of defense , " said @entity14 , 42 , director of the @entity15 for grieving families in @entity17 , @entity18			2
" from the time i was in the hospital to when i was seeing my general practitioner , that 's what they were insisting on			1
" her choice stemmed partly from a longtime aversion to taking prescription drugs			2
it was also the result of listening to a growing group of psychiatrists , psychologists and clinical social workers from around the world who argue that depression and other normal responses to life 's toughest challenges are too often labeled as disorders -- and as such , demand medicine with sometimes dangerous side effects			1
protesters such as @entity14 contend diagnoses of serious psychological and psychiatric disorders have also needlessly skyrocketed alongside the @entity49 ' expanding list of what constitutes mental illness			1
the manual is considered the bible of psychiatry because it 's the criteria mental health professionals use to diagnose patients			1
one example of the issue is the frequency of bipolar disorder in children			2
it has jumped 40-fold in the last two decades , said dr. @entity65 , a former @entity66 psychiatry department chairman			2
using downward dogs to treat depression " you 've got all these young kids running around with this diagnosis , yet many of them have never , ever had a manic episode , which is the hallmark of bipolar disorder , " said @entity65 , now the scientific director of the @entity69			2
" many of these kids , " he continued , " have never had anything other than irritability			2
yet they 're exposed to anti-convulsants , anti-psychotic drugs , which have serious long - term side effects in the form of obesity , metabolic syndrome , diabetes and some movement disorders ... that can leave a person extremely disfigured physically			1
" the @entity89 -- named after the upcoming fifth incarnation of that diagnostic manual -- plans to launch a campaign next month aimed at blocking the manual 's may 20 release			1
short of that , critics plan to press ahead with their case that the @entity49 should be viewed with some skepticism and not wholly embraced by practitioners or patients			1
" we believe that there is now overwhelming evidence that @entity106 is scientifically unsound ( and ) statistically unreliable , " said clinical psychologist @entity101 , director of the @entity103 's @entity102			1
he is helping organize the international campaign with petition drives in the @entity109 , the @entity110 and @entity111			2
the @entity112 , whose manual has been used by health insurers , pharmaceutical companies , doctors and other clinicians since it first published in 1952 , has dismissed @entity49 opponents as overly alarmed			1
" all the good epidemiological studies unfortunately show that one in five people have a psychological disorder			2
... they 're prevalent , they 're just all over the place , and that 's very disturbing to some people , " said dr. @entity123 , a @entity124 psychiatrist and @entity126 director of public health and community psychiatry			1
one of 15 members of a @entity106 committee zeroing in on personality disorders , @entity123 spoke on behalf of the psychiatric association			1
" if you dig down into ( the @entity106 ) , it 's an extraordinarily complex document			1
" being transgender no longer a mental ' disorder ' in diagnostic manual however , critics contend , the manual 's shortcomings include its lack of scientifically conclusive field testing of some of its recommendations ; its failure to consider the prior effectiveness or ineffectiveness of anti-psychotic drugs to determine a patient 's present diagnosis ; and its lumping of , for example , what had been a spectrum of depressions -- from the mildly melancholic to the severely debilitating -- into one group			1
" this is the reason that people nowadays are jumping up and saying , ' the antidepressant drugs do n't work , ' " @entity65 said			0
" if you take this broad category , it 's difficult to even show why they do n't work			1
" " there 's a great deal of a concern , so we are hardly voices in the wilderness , " said dr. @entity168 , author of the book " @entity170 : an insider 's @entity176 , @entity106 , @entity178 and the @entity179			1
" he is largely credited with spearheading @entity181 - 5 efforts			0
" a petition regarding @entity106 , signed by 50 - plus associations , was presented to the ( psychiatric association ) , asking for an independent scientific review			0
the association brushed it aside , " said @entity186 , a @entity66 professor emeritus and former psychiatric department chairman			0
the psychiatric association says the @entity106 was independently reviewed for 18 months but that those findings will not be made public			0
also , the reviewers ' identities will not be disclosed until the manual is released			1
" the development of @entity106 began with an unprecedented process of research evaluation that included a series of white papers and 13 scientific conferences supported by the @entity205 , " wrote dr. @entity195 , chairman of the @entity196 , who oversees the entire @entity106 task force , in an e-mail			0
" this preparation brought together more than 400 international scientists and produced a series of monographs and peer - reviewed journal articles			0
@entity49 is the product of the most extensive discussion and debate -- as part of the most transparent process -- of any @entity49			0
" mental illness in children : know the signs @entity186 contends that the process , though conducted with volunteers , has been somewhat secretive and did not sufficiently consider objections to what the manual will contain			1
@entity186 led the task force that produced the @entity49 in 2000			0
" what motivates me is the experience of having inadvertently contributed to fads and psycho - diagnosis that have resulted in over-diagnosis and over-treatment , " @entity186 said			0
" some of this happened during @entity49 , even though we were more conservative with that document than they 've been with @entity49 , with its many changes that are unsupported and , in some cases , quite reckless			0
" for example , @entity186 said @entity106 would mislabel one in four people with chronic pain and irritable bowel syndrome with the @entity49 's newly created " somatic symptom disorder , " which is diagnosed when a person has spent at least six months steadily thinking of and being anxious about their medical illness			1
according to @entity186 and other like - minded critics , a confluence of related factors resulted in an " over-medicalizing " and over-diagnosis of mental illness			1
chief among them , they contend , is that an increasing number of primary care and other nonpsychiatric doctors are dispensing anti-psychotic drugs , despite their lack of training in that area of medicine			0
aggressive sales and marketing by pharmaceutical companies may also be driving the surge			0
those factors , @entity14 said , were likely part of what was at play after her baby 's stillbirth			1
" i had no mental illness			0
i had never been medicated			0
i had not even suggested that i was depressed , " she said			0
" and i kept asking if anyone merely knew a therapist that i could go talk to about what was clearly a traumatic experience			0
" while @entity14 did n't require prescription medications , even @entity49 protesters acknowledge that there are people whose disorders demand such intensive intervention , perhaps throughout their lifetime			2
still , critics say the upcoming manual veers in the wrong direction			1
" the @entity49 , in many ways , reflects the politics of psychiatry these days , " said dr. @entity290 , author of " prescriptions for the mind : a critical view of @entity297 , " a psychiatry professor at @entity299 and researcher at @entity301 in @entity302 , @entity303			0
" everybody has a kind of investment in certain diagnoses			2
those who are studying a particular disorder often are saying , ' well , this is much more common than you think they are			0
oh , the prevalence is very high			0
' but we risk losing legitimacy because of over-diagnosis			0
... the fact is that most people get by with bad patches in their lives			0
" opinion : film offers ' silver lining ' for mental illness			0

experts say normal responses to life 's challenges are too often labeled disorders
diagnoses have needlessly skyrocketed , say critics of a diagnostic manual
the @entity112 says critics are overly alarmed
