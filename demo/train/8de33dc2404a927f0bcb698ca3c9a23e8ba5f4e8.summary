@entity0 , @entity1 -- the most expensive item on @entity1 's list of economic stimulus projects is drawing fire from some residents and at least one public official , all questioning whether it 's needed at all			2
some residents say it 's wasteful to spend money on a new bridge when there 's one less than three miles away			1
the proposed $ 128 million @entity15 across the @entity16 has been debated in @entity17 , @entity1 , for more than 20 years			1
but now that it has been cleared to receive money from the federal government 's nearly $ 800 billion economic stimulus effort , the debate may be over			1
critics say the span , which will connect the communities of @entity25 and @entity0 , is wasteful because there is already a bridge that connects the two communities less than three miles away			1
" the president should know that this is a boondoggle , and he is getting swindled , " said @entity29 , who has been fighting the bridge for decades and is suing the state @entity31 to try to stop it			1
@entity35 , chairman of the @entity36 , said the existing @entity25 bridge " is in fine shape , " but a bigger bridge is needed			2
" it just simply does n't have the capacity to move more cars over it , " @entity35 told @entity2			2
" it is at capacity			0
every day , as many cars that can go over it during the rush hour times go over it			0
" supporters say the new bridge will ease traffic congestion , aid hurricane evacuations and create about 3,500 jobs			2
" those of us in favor of the bridge ca n't believe that we became so fortuitous that in a time of a recession when jobs are down that we actually found the money and have the opportunity to build this bridge that we 've been planning now for literally over 20 years and now it 's a reality , " @entity35 said			1
@entity17 commissioner @entity63 , one of the few county officials who oppose the bridge , said traffic does back up at the existing bridge			2
but she said the congestion can be resolved without spending money on a new bridge			1
" there are some impediments at either end of the bridge , " @entity71 said			2
" there are stoplights there that are timed so that travelers get stuck at the lights			0
they do n't get stuck on the bridge			1
" and @entity29 said he uses the @entity83 regularly and never has a problem with traffic			0
" my house faces that bridge			2
you can see the cars go over it			0
i go over at 50 , 55 , all the time , " he said			0
another source of contention between @entity17 residents is whether the proposed project is " shovel - ready " -- a major test for stimulus projects , which are aimed at getting people back to work quickly			1
but @entity71 said the state has yet to buy all the property it needs for the right - of - way leading to the bridge , and that challenges from the current owners of those parcels could delay construction			1
" i 'm flabbergasted , to tell you the truth , because my understanding of the stimulus money was it was supposed to be for shovel - ready projects that could be completed in three years			1
this is not shovel - ready , " she said			1
" we have n't acquired the land necessary for right of way			2
we do n't have plans for it			0
" the @entity1 @entity120 says it has purchased 33 of the 63 pieces of property it will need to complete the bridge , and it expects to have all of them acquired by february 2011			0
but @entity29 said some people might refuse to sell			0
" there 's people there who want to stay			0
it 's either their dream house and they 're going to retire there or they 're of modest means and they know they can afford it , but if they go someplace else , they ca n't afford it , " he said			1
one homeowner whose land will be affected by the project , who did not want to be identified , said she had hoped her home " would be a final investment for me			0
" " i think about starting over when i had n't planned on it , " she said			0
if homeowners refuse to sell , the parcels may go into eminent domain disputes that can take years to resolve			0
but @entity35 said the state can acquire the remaining properties quickly using a fast - track settlement , purchasing the properties at their appraised value and negotiating with the homeowner about a buyout price at a later date			0
heard " probably misinterpreted what shovel - ready means , " @entity35 said			1
he said the bridge has already been designed and all federally required studies have been completed , so work on some parts of the project can begin right away			1
" shovel - ready means that the project can move forward within 120 days , and that was a primary criteria in the stimulus plan , " he said			1
@entity1 lawmakers approved the project for stimulus funding in april			0
once the check arrives , construction will begin			0
but @entity71 said local communities should have had more of a say in the decision			0
" i do n't think that 's fair , " @entity71 said			1
" i think we could actually have gotten federal stimulus dollars for projects that we all support and are necessary here			0

proposed $ 128 million @entity15 has been debated for 20 years
critics say it 's wasteful because another bridge connects same two communities
suing resident : " the president should know *...* he is getting swindled "
others say spending should n't be used because project is n't shovel - ready
