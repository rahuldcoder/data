-- a @entity2 professor who allowed a couple to demonstrate a sex toy in front of students apologized saturday , saying he regrets upsetting people and should not have allowed it			1
while psychology professor @entity9 called the incident a " mistake , " he also said the february 21 incident provoked important debate about issues including academic freedom and the effect of sexual attitudes on education			1
" i am sorry that these issues that are important have been raised in this way , instead of directly through words and arguments in the classroom , " @entity9 told @entity0 on saturday			0
" that said , now that they have been raised , let 's talk			0
" it was the first time @entity9 has expressed regret for the incident , which drew national headlines			1
university president @entity30 had said he was " troubled and disappointed " by it and had ordered an investigation			1
the event took place in an optional after - class session for @entity9 's human sexuality course at the prestigious private university near @entity38			1
@entity9 previously explained he wanted students to learn about sexual diversity and information from " real people			2
" students who witnessed the incident had been told repeatedly by a guest speaker that what was about to happen would be graphic , the professor said			1
about 100 students chose to attend following a larger lecture , affiliate @entity49 said			2
@entity9 invited speaker @entity52 , co-owner of @entity53 , who brought a woman and a man for a discussion on the female orgasm			0
@entity52 suggested they demonstrate use of high - powered equipment they brought , said the professor , who agreed to the idea			1
@entity52 told @entity0 affiliate @entity64 that they received " 100 % positive feedback during and after " the demonstration , but some students left while it was happening			2
" for me , i 'm glad i did n't see it			2
it was a little too explicit for me , and if i were in the class , if i would have stayed for the demonstration , i probably would have left			2
i know a couple of my friends did get up and leave , " student @entity73 told @entity0 affiliate @entity64			2
@entity77 , another student , said " doctor @entity9 is one of our finest professors here , and his class is about opening people 's minds up			0
" @entity9 said he was surprised the incident generated so much controversy			0
" during a time of financial crisis , war and global warming , this story has been a top news story for more than two days , " he said in a statement posted on the @entity64 website			0
" that this is so reveals a stark difference of opinion between people like me , who see absolutely no moral harm in what happened , and those who believe it was profoundly wrong			0
" @entity9 told @entity0 he is receiving a " tremendous amount of support " from colleagues , students , parents of students , alumni and academics from all over the world			0
as a researcher of human sexuality and sexual orientation , @entity9 said he has encountered controversy over his work before and has even been attacked because of his research			0
the university , he said , has always been supportive and tolerant			0
" i have felt at least some regret since before this story ever broke , and the more i thought about it , the worse i felt for some of my colleagues at @entity2 who are upset about it , including the president , " he said			1
" it makes his job harder and the benefit to students certainly did not justify the degree to which it has hurt @entity2 at least these past few days			1
" @entity9 said he is working with undergraduate students to arrange an event that includes " high - level discussion and debate " about the incident , and that he hopes to have @entity30 's input for the event			1
@entity0 's @entity139 contributed to this report			0
