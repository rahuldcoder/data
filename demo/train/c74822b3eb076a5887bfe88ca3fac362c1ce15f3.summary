-- @entity2 users can now let any person , company or , presumably , drunken green monster send them private messages on the site			1
the feature appears to be rolling out gradually			0
some users had the ability as of tuesday , while others did n't			2
and it 's not automatic : users will have to opt in to it to enable the new feature			1
until now , people could send private messages on @entity2 to people who follow them but not to others			1
the move comes as @entity2 , which is wildly popular ( it crossed the 200 million - user mark in march ) but not yet profitable , prepares to offer its stock publicly			2
as word of the new feature rolled out , that had many users speculating , not always positively , about how companies could use the feature to spread the word about their products			0
" should be renamed ' check this box if you would like 99 % more spam ! ' " wrote a commenter on a story from tech site @entity36			0
in addition to allowing brands to send personal messages , or receive them , the new feature could be used by media sites to send news alerts			0
@entity2 has experimented with a service that would send links to news articles to users privately			2
early observations tuesday of the change , which @entity2 has not acknowledged publicly , were focusing on the potential upsides and downsides			0
" enabling this option could potentially mean open season on your @entity2 inbox , " wrote @entity50 for @entity51 , " and that 's probably why it 's off by default -- but if dealing with a potential influx of spam is worth opening up a new channel of communication for you , then this is a welcome change indeed			1

@entity2 is making direct messages open to people you do n't follow
users will have to opt in to the feature
some see *broader* communication , while others see spam
