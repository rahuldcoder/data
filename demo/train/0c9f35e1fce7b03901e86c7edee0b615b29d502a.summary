@entity1 , @entity0 -- it 's a question that i have asked myself for a long time			0
why ca n't @entity5 produce a top golfer ? @entity7 was the only @entity5 golfer to make the cut at the recent @entity5 masters			2
the weather is great , courses are popping up all over the country , and still , they do n't have a single player in the top 400 of the world rankings			1
on the surface , it might not make sense , but if you dig a little a deeper , like i had a chance to do during a recent @entity23 report in the @entity24 , there are plenty of reasons why golf is n't taking off among the locals			0
the most shocking statistic of all is that in the whole country there is not a single public golf course			0
this means if you want to play , you have to become a member of a club or pay something in the region of 100 euros ( $ 137 ) for a round of golf			0
considering the minimum salary in @entity5 is under 400 euros a month , it becomes clear the vast majority of @entity5 people simply ca n't afford it			2
this means most of the people out on golf courses in @entity5 are foreign , and while this is great for tourism , it 's doing nothing to help the grass roots of the game in the country			1
another issue is that the sport is seen as elitist and is not part of the nation 's sporting culture			0
there is great passion among @entity5 's youngsters , as there is in many @entity64 countries , for football			1
and though people play other sports , and you can get lessons in sports like golf , there is an almost complete lack of interest -- no - one really talks about golf			0
what the country really needs is a golfing superstar to kick - start a revolution and inspire the new generation -- a @entity81 of golf			1
the @entity82 says the tide is turning and they claim they are doing their best to invest in young amateur players			0
they also have allies with some of the private investors who have built golf courses in @entity5 sponsoring some of the nation 's top prospects			1
@entity90 is an example of this , with the company that has built seven courses in the @entity24 backing three of @entity5 's five professionals			1
the more organizations that invest in up - and - coming golfers like this , the more chance @entity5 will have in producing the next @entity101			2
there could yet be hope for golf in the country , but it will take more investment , more time and a figure to unite an otherwise football obsessed country around a relatively neglected sport			0
watch @entity113 examine @entity5 's golf scene on this month 's @entity23 , which airs thursday , november 6 , 1400 , 1830 ; saturday , november 8 , 0800 , 1830 sunday ; november 9 , 0400 , 0830 , 1430 ( all times gmt ) .			1

@entity5 has an ever - growing number of great golf courses
there are no @entity5 players in the world 's top 400
golf is too *expensive* and not high profile enough there
if there were a @entity81 of golf , children might take it up
