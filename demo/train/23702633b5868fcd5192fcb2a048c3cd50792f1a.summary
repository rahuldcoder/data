-- a few weeks ago , an @entity2 campaign exploded on @entity3			1
the @entity2 hashtag -- # الراتب_مايكفي_الحاجة ( loosely translated as " the salary does not meet my needs " ) -- reached 17 million tweets in the first two weeks			0
at its height , it registered 1.2 million tweets a day , and was not only the most popular hashtag in @entity2 , but the 16th most popular in any language			1
somewhat unexpectedly , the campaign , which hints at a financially aggrieved populace , comes out of one of the world 's wealthiest nations : @entity19			1
" there 's a feeling among some people that i guess you could characterize as anger			0
others are disappointed , some think it 's a question of ( the @entity19 government 's ) priorities , " says @entity26 , a @entity19 political analyst with @entity27 the anger he refers to is fueled by growing unemployment and frustration at government spending			1
@entity26 notes that the campaign gained particular traction following the @entity19 government 's announcement that it would give financial aid to @entity43 's military regime			1
" the government is giving handouts to @entity43 , @entity46 and @entity47 , and using a third of the country 's budget for this year to pay for the @entity52 metro			1
meanwhile , @entity19 's are paying most of their salary on rent , private schools , private hospitals -- because public ones are n't good -- while salaries have practically stayed the same , " laments @entity53 , a @entity19 activist who gained notoriety for posting video of herself driving on @entity56			1
she is also one of the country 's most vocal tweeters			1
" there 's a long list of things that are wrong , " she adds			0
unemployment is higher than one might suspect in the oil - rich nation			0
though official figures are hard to come by , there are approximately 1.8 million @entity19 enrolled with @entity74 -- the country 's unemployment benefits program -- according to @entity77 , a @entity78 researcher with @entity79			1
the campaign has also drawn attention to a topic that was once considered taboo : @entity19 poverty			1
accompanying many of the tweets are images and video supposedly depicting @entity19 living in squalor ; some show @entity19 's beggar class while others reveal the existence of @entity19 shanties			1
@entity95 , a photographer who documented @entity19 poverty in @entity52 for @entity97 , recalls how the assignment challenged her expectations			2
" what you see on the surface are the shiny buildings and the shopping malls and the new universities being built -- the wealthy side			0
i was actually quite shocked when we went to the slums , " she says			0
she recounted families struggling to pay the bills , and living in single - story , cockroach infested houses in the heart of @entity19 's capital			2
" poverty in @entity19 challenges many people 's assumptions , including some @entity19 ' , " admits @entity26			2
poverty and unemployment are particularly rife among @entity19 youths ( @entity121 estimates they make up anywhere between 18 and 35 % of the unemployment rate ) , and even more so among women			1
according to @entity129 newspaper the @entity125 , an annual report put out earlier this year by the @entity127 showed @entity19 men in the private sector earn an average of $ 1,516 , with women staffers pulling in half that sum			2
@entity135 notes that working women are at a further disadvantage due to the many practices that are banned to them			0
" a woman in @entity19 is dependent on men to do just about everything in her life			2
if a man does n't exist , she will have to pay for those services she ca n't do herself , like driving a car , starting her own business or going to court , " she notes			0
read more : @entity19 's first anti-abuse campaign despite its popularity , the campaign has attracted critics who argue @entity19 are already too reliant on their government			1
@entity26 himself notes that the campaign risks oversimplifying what is actually a very complex issue			0
several factors , he argues , have fed unemployment , including a population explosion -- since the ' 70s , @entity19 has grown from 6 million people to nearly 20 million , with an additional 10 million expats competing with nationals for jobs			1
adding to the problem is the fact that in the past , many @entity19 chose to study religion and languages -- areas for which there is little demand			2
" it 's a complex situation , as is true of any economy			0
people who try to trivialize or simplify it miss a lot of variables , " says @entity26			0
regardless of where one stands on the issue , what 's been particularly surprising is the willingness of @entity19 -- who traditionally value cultural privacy -- to air their grievances in an international forum			2
" it 's true , we are a very private nation , and we do n't want the rest of the world to know anything about us , " admits @entity135			0
however , she says , it 's a price many @entity19 are willing to pay			0
" @entity19 are realizing that you ca n't isolate yourself from the rest of the world , because the only way we can communicate and read each other 's views is through social media			0
it 's our kind of parliament , where we can go and debate , and do things we ca n't do in the real world			0

@entity3 users have *flocked* to a campaign bemoaning wages in their country .
the hashtag became the 16th most popular in any language .
high unemployment and government spending has fueled resentment in @entity19 .
many tweeters shared images and videos of *impoverished* @entity19 .
