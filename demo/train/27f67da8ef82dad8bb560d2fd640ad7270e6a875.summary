@entity0 -- a woman asked rep. @entity3 at a town hall meeting the other day if health care reform proposals would force people to let the government access their bank accounts			1
false rumors about health care have been aired at town hall meetings , like this one in @entity12 last week			1
" that 's not true , " the @entity14 @entity13 responded			0
" when someone sends you something on the internet that sounds crazy , how about just checking it a little bit ? " the @entity21 , which fact - checks political claims , has debunked the bank - access rumor as false			1
yet that claim , and others that have been disproved , keep coming up in the national debate on health care reform , inflaming an already emotional issue			2
heated protests have disrupted town hall meetings nationwide , with people shouting at legislators and venting anger at president @entity36			1
while the anger is genuine , some of it is based on misunderstandings of the actual proposals , said @entity41 , a health policy expert at @entity43			2
" people are freaked out because there 's a lot of bad information and misinformation being ... put out there by opponents of health care reform , " @entity41 told @entity1			0
@entity36 and the @entity52 say misleading information sows fear and anger , particularly among senior citizens who are worried about how changes in health care could affect @entity59			2
the @entity60 and @entity60 speaker @entity61 have set up web campaigns to refute what they describe as provably false information			0
" it is now evident that an ugly campaign is under way not merely to misrepresent the health insurance reform legislation , but to disrupt public meetings and prevent members of @entity73 and constituents from conducting a civil dialogue , " @entity61 and @entity60 majority leader @entity65 wrote in a recent commentary			1
@entity77 opponents respond that the emotional reaction is due to @entity52 efforts to rush through legislation that amounts to a government takeover of the health care system			1
they say the proposals eventually will lead to a system that rations treatment based on an individual 's ability to contribute to society			1
" we 've actually started a national debate about exactly what is at stake here , " @entity90 chairman @entity89 said wednesday			2
speaking on @entity95 , @entity89 said the town hall meetings across the country are reflecting that debate			1
however , when asked directly about one of the most controversial statements by some @entity77 -- that a @entity60 bill would create " death panels " to decide who gets treatment -- @entity89 refused to acknowledge that such language was misinformation			1
the @entity21 determined the " death panel " claim was false , along with others spread by conservative commentators and activist groups who say @entity52 proposals would promote euthanizing elderly @entity114 and mandate free health insurance for illegal immigrants			1
one of the most disputed provisions , contained in a @entity60 health care proposal , would pay doctors for consultations with patients on end - of - life issues , such as living wills			1
the proposal is similar to one originally written by @entity77 sen. @entity125 of @entity126			2
opponents have implied or said outright that consultations would be required -- even though the proposal says they would be voluntary			0
some @entity77 and @entity52 have rejected the " death panel " language , but the issue keeps coming up			1
at a town hall meeting tuesday night in @entity133 , @entity134 , powerful @entity60 @entity131 rep. @entity131 called the notion that health care legislation required killing elderly people " the single stupidest thing i 've heard			1
" @entity36 says the misinformation confuses people over an already complex issue that requires public understanding			0
" the notion that somehow i ran for public office or members of @entity73 are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma ... when you start making arguments like that , it 's simply dishonest , " the president recently said			0
@entity155 , a former insurance company communications executive , told @entity1 that the insurance industry deliberately spreads false information with the goal of disrupting the debate			2
the insurance industry hires public relations firms that create front groups to try to " destroy health care reform by using terms like ' government takeover of the health care system ' or we are heading down a ' slippery slope toward socialism ' or ' we 're going to kill your grandpa ' because of these health care regulations , " said @entity155 , now a senior fellow at the @entity174 , which calls itself a nonpartisan watchdog group on public relations spin			0
asked to respond to @entity155 's accusation , the director of strategic communications at @entity180 , @entity181 , acknowledged in an e-mail wednesday that the group opposes some aspects of @entity52 health care proposals			2
" we have been very clear and up front since day one about our opposition to a government - run insurance plan that would dismantle employer coverage , bankrupt hospitals , and increase the federal deficit , " @entity181 's e-mail said			2
he denied that employees of his group , which is the national association of health insurers , were " responsible for disruptive and inappropriate tactics at health care town hall meetings			1
" however , some of the language cited by @entity155 is used by politicians , including @entity77 sen. @entity203 of @entity204 , who told the @entity206 program " @entity207 " on sunday that " the @entity52 want a government plan , where the government will take over health care			1
" @entity52 proposals call for creating a government - funded health insurance plan for people who otherwise lack coverage			1
that is the so - called public option , which they say would compete with private insurers			0
@entity203 and other @entity77 argue the public option would create a subsidized competitor that would drive private insurers out of business , leading to the government taking over the health care system			2
though @entity52 deny that @entity77 assertion , it touches on broader fears among conservatives			1
many conservatives consider the proposed health care overhaul an irresponsible and dangerous expansion of the federal government			0
they liken it to socialist - style control over private issues , at a cost of nearly $ 1 trillion over 10 years			0
at the same time , @entity114 facing an economic recession and costly government responses -- such as the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package and billions more paid to bail out the financial services and auto industries -- are fearful of further change and additional federal debt			0
such concerns come up repeatedly at the town hall meetings held by @entity52 and @entity77			1
the deficit recently topped $ 1 trillion for the first time ; @entity36 has said he hopes to cut it in half by the end of his first term			0
" when the economy is hurting , people are more inclined , i think , to be skeptical , nervous , " @entity131 said			0
the misinformation , while refuted , has brought changes in the debate			0
conservative commentator @entity256 exulted monday when @entity77 sen. @entity257 of @entity258 said that @entity260 negotiators dropped the end - of - life consultation provision from their proposal because @entity257 said he worried it " could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly			1
" @entity256 said on his radio show that no matter what the health care proposals say , they will result in less money available for health care			0
" it will forever transform the relationship between @entity114 , " he said			0
" we will instantly become rivals			0
we 're going to become competitors vying against each other for precious health care dollars			0
" @entity257 , who is one of three republicans negotiating a possible bipartisan health care agreement , has used controversial language himself			0
he told a town hall meeting last week he could n't support a provision that would " pull the plug on grandma			1
" former @entity52 sen. @entity283 called such comments part of the problem			2
" it 's hyperbolic , it 's fear - mongering , it 's actually politics at its worst , " @entity283 said sunday on @entity206 's " @entity207			0
" " that 's the kind of thing that generates the kind of anger and fear and anxiety that people have today			0

claims that have been debunked continue to pop up in town hall meetings , protests
dems say " ugly campaign " under way to misrepresent proposals , disrupt debate
@entity77 says @entity52 trying to rush through a bill that eventually would lead to rationing
end - of - life provision that *sparked* " death panel " rumor dropped from @entity260 version
