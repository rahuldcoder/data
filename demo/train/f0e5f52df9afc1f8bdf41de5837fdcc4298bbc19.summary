-- from the @entity1 , composed in @entity2 4,000 years ago , to @entity3 -- @entity4 's 2007 take on the @entity6 story -- floods and their catastrophic effects have long provided inspiration for storytellers			2
as global warming provokes increasingly severe weather events , however , the gap between art and life is fast narrowing , with apocalyptic flooding scenarios now as common in reality as in the imaginations of @entity4 scriptwriters			0
recent flooding in the @entity21 , for example -- the worst for 60 years -- left some 30,000 people homeless and the insurance industry facing over Â£ 3 billion ( $ 6 billion ) in payouts			0
torrential rains in @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 have caused even greater misery , claiming hundreds of lives and displacing an estimated 20 million civilians			0
in the @entity34 , meanwhile , @entity33 continues to suffer from the ravages of 2005 's @entity36 , with much of the city still empty and uninhabitable two years after the deluge			0
with low - lying areas around the world increasingly susceptible to flooding -- this at a time when population growth has necessitated the construction of more and more homes in such areas -- the question of how to balance the need for housing with the dangers of rising water levels has never been more pressing			1
in the @entity54 , where half the country lies below mean sea level and flooding has long been a fact of life , construction and engineering company @entity61 has come up with a novel and , when you think about it , obvious solution to the problem : houses that float			1
" these type of homes offer a good way of dealing with the effects of climate change , " @entity61 spokesman @entity68 told @entity0			2
" unlike normal houses , they are extremely flexible when it comes to flooding , able to deal with a sea level rise of up to five metres			1
" in a country such as @entity81 , where flooding is a serious problem , this sort of technology could have an extremely important role to play			0
" the company has developed two variations on the same theme : a floating house which , as the name suggests , sits permanently on the water like a boat ; and an amphibious house that stands on dry land but , in the event of floods , is able to rise with the water			1
both employ a large hollow concrete cube at their base to provide buoyancy , and are " moored " in pairs to huge steel piles to keep them anchored in one place , the piles enabling them to withstand currents as strong as you would find on the open seas			0
water and electricity are brought in through flexible pipes that have been adapted to bend and move with the swell of the water			0
in every other respect they look and feel like normal homes -- albeit up - market designer homes -- with split - level accommodation , wooden balconies and clapboard exteriors painted cheery shades of yellow , green and blue			1
" the steel piles mean that residents experience no horizontal , side - to - side movement , " explains van der @entity120 " although there is a small amount of vertical , up and down movement , most residents say they find the feeling quite enjoyable			0
" these houses not only offer protection against floods , but also great quality of living and low environmental impact			1
" so far @entity61 has built 46 such water - friendly units - 14 floating and 32 amphibious - at @entity143 , on the banks of the @entity138 in @entity140 province in the centre of the country			1
the technology and design -- the latter provided by @entity54 architectural firm @entity147 -- took three years to develop , although obtaining a government green light for the project took considerably longer			1
" after the disastrous floods of 1995 the @entity54 government laid down strict rules forbidding the building of houses beside rivers			1
" we had a lot of discussion with them and eventually those rules were adapted to allow for the construction of suitable housing at fifteen separate river locations , of which @entity143 is one			0
" our philosophy is that you can look at water as a threat , but also as a challenge and a commercial opportunity			0
combining water and housing is the obvious way forward in countries such as the @entity54			1
" floating buildings are certainly not the only way of achieving such a combination			0
@entity61 is also developing what they term " dry - proof " and " wet - proof " houses , the former designed to prevent water intrusion , the latter to actually allow it			1
" the idea with wet - proof houses is that all the essential rooms -- living room , kitchen , bedroom - are on the upper floors , " explains van der @entity120 " in the event of a flood you open the doors and allow the water to enter the non-essential lower rooms , which have been specially designed to resist water damage , with waterproof plaster and specially adapted electrics and plumbing			2
" it is how houses in @entity81 always used to be built			2
" if there are a number of technological options , however , it is the idea of a floating house , one that can withstand rising water levels by literally rising with them , that has attracted the most interest , both within the @entity54 and from countries with similar flooding issues			1
" there have been enquiries from around the world , " says van der @entity120 " we are now working with companies in the @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity34 and elsewhere in @entity222 , although we ourselves will only be building houses in @entity81			0
" the houses are certainly not being touted as an alternative to conventional flood defenses such as dykes , levees and river barriers			0
nor are they cheap , their starting price of 260,000 euros ( $ 310,000 ) meaning that , in terms of mass construction , it is only the world 's more affluent nations that will be able to afford them ( although as van der @entity68 points out , developing countries such as @entity29 tend to use materials other than concrete to build houses , so probably would have much use for these type of structures anyway			2
) in @entity222 , the @entity34 , and @entity246 , on the other hand , such buildings could well become the norm , with @entity61 and a number of other @entity54 companies already exploring the possibility of entire cities built in this manner			1
with scientists predicting sea - level rises of up to 110 cms ( 43 inches ) by 2100 , and catastrophic weather events becoming ever more common , the floating house could be the only realistic way for people to continue living in low - lying areas without fear of losing their homes , possessions and even lives to flooding			1
as @entity54 housing minister @entity266 recently put it : " you can not fight water			2
you have to learn how to live with it			0
" or in this case , float on it			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... are floating houses the answer to rising sea levels ? would you live in a floating home ? share your views and read others ' thoughts in the @entity278 forum .			2
