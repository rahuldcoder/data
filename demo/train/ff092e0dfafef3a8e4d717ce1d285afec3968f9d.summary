-- sen. @entity1 told supporters he will " take nothing for granted " after defeating former rep. @entity4 in a bitterly fought @entity6 primary for @entity7 in @entity8 tuesday			1
" i ... will fight with every ounce of strength and conviction i possess to make the case for my continued service in the @entity7 , and the policies and principles i will advocate and defend if i 'm fortunate to be re-elected , " @entity1 said in his victory speech tuesday night			1
@entity1 -- seeking a fifth term as senator -- was ahead 58.8 percent to 29.8 percent , with 20 percent of precincts reporting , according to @entity20			2
the race between @entity1 -- the 2008 @entity6 presidential nominee -- and conservative talk show host @entity4 started off nasty and did n't get any friendlier down the home stretch			1
forced to spend $ 20 million in the campaign , @entity1 was driven to the right on some issues as @entity4 accused him of not being a true conservative			0
@entity1 is expected to easily beat any one of the four @entity30 primary candidates in the solidly red state			2
in @entity34 -- one of four other states to hold primaries tuesday -- millionaire political newcomer @entity36 claimed victory over @entity34 attorney general @entity38 in the @entity6 primary for governor			1
in a speech to supporters , @entity36 , who spent $ 50 million of his own fortune since joining the race in april , alluded to the divisive nature of his fight against @entity38 , the party - establishment favorite and former congressman			1
" some of you may have noticed this was a hard - fought race			0
we talked a lot about our differences , but tonight it 's time to remember those things that bring us together -- to recall our core beliefs and recommit ourselves to fighting for our principles , " @entity36 said			2
" the @entity6 will come together , and the reason we will come together is our shared devotion to the values that make @entity64 great			0
" @entity36 was ahead of @entity38 , 46.5 percent to 43.4 percent , with 96 percent of precincts reporting , according to @entity20			1
the winner will face a november general election against @entity68 , @entity34 's chief financial officer , whom @entity0 projected will win the state 's @entity30 primary for governor			1
in a different race featuring a political veteran against a self - funded candidate with deep pockets , rep. @entity72 declared victory over billionaire @entity78 in @entity34 's @entity30 primary for @entity7			1
@entity72 led @entity80 57.3 percent to 31.2 percent , with 97 percent of precincts reporting , according to @entity20			0
@entity72 will take on @entity82 -- who won the @entity6 primary for @entity7 -- and gov. @entity84 , a @entity6 - turned independent , in the general election			1
in an e-mail tuesday night , @entity72 thanked supporters for lifting him past @entity78 , a billionaire real estate investor who was funding his own bid after making a fortune betting against the housing market			1
" the pundits thought this seat could be bought			0
our critics wrote us off			0
but together , you and i proved them wrong , " @entity72 's message said			2
@entity72 used his victory speech minutes later to try and establish himself as the candidate for @entity30 voters in november			2
he noted that he is " running against two conservative candidates " -- a clear swipe at @entity84 , who could siphon votes from @entity72 in november			1
" i made the case , and i am the real @entity108 in this race , " @entity72 said			2
@entity84 , who avoided a primary battle with @entity82 by announcing an independent candidacy , framed the three - way @entity7 race as a choice between him , the hard right and the hard left			1
" if ... you want somebody who wants to fight the gridlock in @entity118 and put the people first instead of the party , [ and ] do what 's right for @entity34 rather than what 's right for @entity118 or right for just @entity6 or @entity30 , then you have an alternative , " he told @entity0 's " @entity124 " on tuesday night			1
@entity82 told his supporters that @entity84 and @entity72 would be the candidates for voters who already " like the direction that @entity64 is headed			1
" " if , on the other hand , you are unhappy with the direction that @entity118 is taking @entity64 ... then there is only one person running , there is only one campaign in @entity34 in 2010 that is offering to stand up to that agenda , " @entity82 said			2
@entity34 's @entity30 primary for @entity7 and the @entity6 primary for governor were two races in which two deep - pocketed political novices came virtually out of nowhere this spring , but managed to transform a pair of primaries into two of the most outlandish contests of the 2010 cycle			1
@entity72 , a @entity108 from @entity147 , @entity34 , had a clear path to his party 's @entity7 nomination until april , when @entity78 decided to fund his own bid			1
both campaigns quickly trained fire on one another , with @entity72 dubbing @entity78 a " @entity155			0
" @entity78 linked @entity72 to an indicted @entity147 real estate developer and questioned @entity72 's commitment to @entity158 , a weighty charge in a state with a large population of @entity163 voters			2
republicans also were grappling with a divisive primary in the governor 's race between @entity38 , a former congressman backed by the state 's party establishment , and @entity36 , a millionaire former health care executive			1
@entity36 spent $ 50 million of his personal fortune since joining the race in april , mostly by blanketing @entity34 's expensive television and radio airwaves with advertisements questioning @entity38 's conservative bona fides. he eventually stumbled on the campaign trail as he faced questions about his management of two health care companies that went on to face legal problems			1
@entity8 's @entity6 @entity7 race also was bitter , with @entity4 insisting that after running to the right in the primary , @entity1 would seek to build his legacy by cutting deals with president @entity187 and the @entity30 if re-elected			1
fights over immigration fueled the race , as @entity4 and @entity192 activists challenged @entity1 's previous efforts at reform , which called for tougher border security , but included a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented workers			1
but @entity1 defended @entity8 's new immigration law , @entity199 , and went on a six - stop statewide tour with @entity8 gov. @entity201 , whose signing of the bill earned her wide praise from conservatives , and made her the symbol of opposition to amnesty			2
on tuesday night , @entity1 told supporters he was convinced that @entity6 will regain majorities in both the @entity7 and the @entity211			1
" and when we do , we will stop the out of control spending and tax increases and repeal and replace @entity215 , " @entity1 said			0
" we will keep families in their homes , we will create new jobs and we will allow our businesses to grow without @entity118 interference			0
we will secure our borders , defend our nation and bring our troops home from @entity224 with honor and victory			0
" other races : -- @entity6 gov. @entity201 of @entity8 easily won her party 's gubernatorial nomination tuesday night , according to a @entity0 projection			2
@entity231 captured 87 percent of the vote in the @entity6 primary election , according to early unofficial vote returns from the @entity20 -- in @entity235 , incumbent @entity6 sen. @entity236 , with one of the best - known political names in the state , is pitted against an unknown challenger			1
but attorney @entity241 's campaign picked up the support of the @entity192 movement and the backing of former @entity235 gov. @entity245			0
in a last - minute robocall for @entity241 , @entity245 went after @entity236 saying , " @entity236 has voted with the @entity30 more than any @entity6 up for re-election this year			0
she waffled on the repeal of @entity215 , co-sponsored cap and trade and voted for @entity251			0
" but some think that endorsement of @entity241 is at least partly personal			0
@entity245 had tangled with @entity236 's father @entity254 and defeated him in the 2006 governor 's race			2
the @entity192 made its support known again in the final hours , promoting the more than half - million dollars it put into @entity241 's campaign			0
-- also in @entity235 , voters decide on gubernatorial nominees			0
gov. @entity261 , who replaced @entity245 when she resigned last year , faces two challengers in the @entity6 primary			1
two democrats are battling for their party 's nomination			0
-- longtime @entity267 gov. @entity267 is retiring in @entity268 , giving @entity30 hope of competing for the seat			0
five @entity30 are running in what 's considered a tight race			0
the winner will face @entity6 lt. gov. @entity273			0
-- in @entity275 , two @entity211 @entity6 nominations will be decided in a runoff			0
in the @entity277 , @entity6 think they have a chance for a pickup this fall against conservative democrat @entity280			0
and two @entity6 are battling to likely replace rep. @entity281 , who 's running for governor			2
-- a 10 - way @entity6 primary in the @entity8 3rd @entity285 race to replace retiring rep. @entity286 has attracted national attention because @entity288 , son of former vice president @entity289 , is one of the candidates			1
the winner will face @entity108 @entity292 in the fall in the heavily red district			0
@entity0 's @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 and @entity299 contributed to this report .			0
