-- there was no feeling in @entity4 's leg when he regained consciousness in hospital after his skiing accident			1
as he blinked and opened his eyes , his first question to his wife , who was sitting at his bedside , was whether he would have to spend his life in a wheelchair			0
" she said ' no you do n't , ' " @entity4 told @entity0			1
" ' everything is ok , you can get on with your life but they had to amputate your leg			2
our life is going to go on			0
" he has absolutely no memory of the day five years ago when his life changed forever			2
on sunday march 2 , 2008 he was competing in a @entity25 super-g race -- in @entity26 , @entity27 -- and crashed into a gate , falling down the mountainside , breaking his leg in the process			1
" i just do n't remember anything from the accident , it 's nothing			1
i know until the gate and crashing , then nothing			2
i think it 's good for me that way right now			2
" @entity4 was once the rising star of @entity39 alpine skiing			1
a junior world champion , he had won the @entity41 and picked up a podium finish in a @entity43 in 2005			0
but his horrific accident brutally halted his career 's rising trajectory			1
the resulting damage to his blood circulation in his leg meant the doctors had to amputate below the left knee -- had they not done so , he could have died			2
" i know that maybe things could have been done differently , " @entity4 says wistfully			1
" but what is the point of thinking about it ? the fact is i ca n't change my amputation			1
when i think about it or i 'm angry about it , it does n't matter as the reality is that would not change a thing			2
so what 's the point ? " the fact is i have an amputation and i look forward not back			1
i like to live life in a positive way			0
" most immediately , he is looking forward to the @entity71 , his skiing career continuing but merely realigned after his life changing accident			1
where once he had aspired to compete in both @entity75 and @entity76 alongside able bodied athletes , he will instead take part at the @entity79 in the @entity81 city , and he has modest ambitions			1
despite winning gold , silver and bronze at this season 's @entity86 , he has one , simple target			1
" when i get to @entity76 , a medal is the goal , " he says , " and obviously gold would be nice			1
but more important than that is the way to @entity76			1
" the years have been very tough , so this journey is still the most important			0
" for me , the pleasure will just be to start in @entity76			1
if i could then get a medal -- even maybe a gold -- that would be the dream coming true			0
that is the reason why i did my comeback			0
" lure of the slopes after the amputation , @entity4 had opted not to return to the slopes and test his skiing prowess once more			1
with a new job with the ski manufacturer @entity109 , he felt his life had moved on but gradually his view shifted , and the lure of the slopes returned			0
" i never wanted to come back to the sport , " he admits			2
" i wanted to do my new life			0
i studied in business administration and then onto my work as marketing manager for @entity109			0
" everything was fine in my new life , with many other things other than skiing			0
" but then i started to think how i would feel in 30 or 40 years if i did not try it competitively again			0
so i wanted to answer that question			0
" for his first competitive run , he admitted he was awash with nerves , unsure how well he had adapted in training to skiing on a prosthetic leg and of the different technique required to tackle the gates on the course			1
" after that first run , the feeling was back , " he says			0
" it was the feeling of my last race , like it was a few months ago and not three years ago			0
since then , i like racing , maybe even more than before the accident because now i do it for fun , the pressure is gone			0
" @entity4 has not watched his accident back , although he is slowly coming round to the idea that one day he will			1
" maybe in the future i 'll watch to find out what happened , " he says			0
" but right now , i do n't see any benefits at all			1
his training for @entity76 is currently in full swing and , for now , his stump is in good order , although he has had problems in the past			2
severe inflammation in previous seasons meant he had to undergo further surgery -- " the pressure on the stump when skiing is so much " -- but he is now on top of the problem , getting the right balance of neither too much nor too little exercise on it			0
guiding him to @entity76 is his coach @entity162 , who has worked with @entity4 since his decision to return to competitive skiing			1
@entity162 says he has not had to work on his pupil 's mental demons returning to a sport that cost him a leg			2
" to be able to come to the team , you have to be able to have worked through that first , " says @entity162			0
" @entity4 has done that			2
if not , you ca n't do the sport at the highest level			0
" he has a chance to medal in every discipline			0
he 's a special guy , with coming back from that bad @entity25 accident			1
" both @entity162 and @entity4 are pushing to improve the backing and profile for disabled skiing in @entity39			1
@entity162 describes it as " really bad " while @entity4 says " things are getting better " but that it is a painfully slow process			2
should @entity4 , named @entity39 's disabled athlete of the year in 2012 , win gold in @entity76 , that will only help the cause			1
as for what is in store for him after his @entity81 adventure , he genuinely has no idea			0
" i 've not thought about it , " he says of life after @entity76			2
" let 's see what i do there first			0
" a gold around his neck would surely be the perfect outcome to an often long and tortuous journey .			0

@entity4 underwent leg amputation after crashing *heavily* on the @entity25 circuit
@entity39 skier gave up hope of skiing again but is now targeting medals at the @entity76
a three - time medallist at this year 's @entity86 , @entity4 is a strong *contender*
to this day , he still can not watch back the accident - " i do n't see any benefits at all "
