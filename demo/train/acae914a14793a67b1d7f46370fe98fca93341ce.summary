he said yellowcake uranium is a commonly traded commodity used for nuclear power generation			2
it is not enriched and can not be used without first going through a complicated enrichment process , he said , but because of the unstable nature of @entity4 , the @entity3 and the @entity4 government decided it should be moved out of that country			1

from that third country , @entity16 said , the containers were loaded onto the @entity78 , a @entity3 - owned crane ship normally used to haul equipment in and out of war zones			0
the ship carried the uranium to @entity15 , where it was bought by @entity32 , a private firm			0
the uranium will be sent by truck to two processing plants in @entity87 , @entity34 said			0
once it has been enriched for energy use it will be sold to power plant operators , he said			0
the @entity3 is @entity32 's largest customer , @entity34 said , but he did not specify if the @entity4 yellowcake would ultimately end up in the @entity3			1
@entity16 said the @entity2 's cost of securing and transporting the uranium from @entity60 to @entity15 was $ 70 million , and the government of @entity4 had agreed in principal to reimburse the @entity3 for part of that cost			1
