-- the fairy tale forests of the @entity2 in @entity3 , the beauty of @entity5 in @entity6 and the 170 - foot - high @entity7 in @entity8 were waiting for author @entity9 to discover them			1
the newly independent countries of @entity6 , @entity3 and @entity8 were reeling from the collapse of the @entity14 in 1991 and were not tourist friendly enough to include in her first edition of " @entity9 , " published in 2003			1
also missing were the stunning @entity18 beaches of @entity19 , @entity20 ; the ancient @entity23 arena of @entity24 , @entity25 ; and the pedestrian bridges over the @entity26 in @entity27			2
the civil war in @entity29 , following on the heels of the fall of the @entity14 , kept her away			1
more than 20 years after the collapse of communism in @entity41 , the new " @entity9 " includes the @entity37 nations formerly under @entity14 control , the nations of the former @entity29 and several other countries once considered too dangerous or unfriendly for any but the most hardy travelers			1
there are also places like @entity44 and @entity45 that @entity46 did n't have time to tackle in the first book			1
all in all , the second edition includes 200 more entries , 28 additional countries , 200 more pages , 600 color photographs and an interactive @entity55 app. now that travel is more accessible and people want to see and do more things they 've never experienced before , @entity46 has expanded the " 1,000 places " concept beyond that " once - in - a - lifetime " honeymoon , 25th anniversary or 75th birthday trip			1
her hotel recommendations now include smaller , more affordable inns in addition to the most fabulous hotels			0
the definition of " 1,000 places " has expanded to include itineraries or experiences within particular regions			1
" there 's nothing or no place that does n't interest me for some rhyme or reason , from natural beauty to man - made beauty , from high - brow to low - brow , from festivals to food to culture to music to design , " says @entity46 , who has traveled professionally for most of her adult life			0
she estimates she visited 80 % of the sites included in the book			0
" so much to see , so little time ! " she said			0
" one would need to be 200 years old to have seen them all			0
" ( a seasoned travel writer , she knows " quite confidently " that @entity91 and other places she has n't visited do belong in the book			2
) for the rookie or nervous traveler for the new or nervous traveler who wants to explore outside his comfort zone , @entity46 suggests traveling with the tour operators she includes in many listings			1
it 's probably the smart way to go in the @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 , where cultural differences and language barriers may trip up the inexperienced or solo traveler			1
" it 's a great way to travel if your best friend or husband is n't available to go or interested in going , " she said			0
an inexperienced @entity112 - speaking traveler can travel far away to @entity113 or @entity114 and enjoy the differences of a country that shares some common language and history			2
" you 'll hear this wonderfully accented @entity112 that is not your own , so you 're always aware these are experiences you would never have had at home if you stayed within our borders			0
" it 's exotic enough to be exciting and exhilarating , but easy enough to do solo -- minus that inherent risk of being in countries that are always on the front page of the newspaper , filling your head with risks , " she said			2
for @entity133 residents who prefer to stay within the @entity133 , @entity46 has added new entries on the @entity135 in @entity136 and @entity137 ; the @entity138 in @entity139 and @entity140 , @entity141 ; and @entity142 , @entity143			0
chapters on popular cities such as @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 have turned into mega-entries			0
( @entity46 has also written " 1,000 places to see in the @entity133 and @entity151 before you die			2
" ) get out of your comfort zone explorers can expand their bucket lists by finding someplace they 've never been before			0
be the first in your family to explore the 11 underground churches excavated out of stone in the @entity162 town of @entity163			2
they 've been in continuous use since the 12th century			0
or head to @entity44 's @entity166 , the first @entity168 slave - trading post in @entity102			0
there 's also plenty to explore in @entity45 , 85 % of which is still covered by ice			2
the island , a self - governing territory of @entity175 , says that global warming has created the fastest - retreating ice cap in the @entity178			0
still on @entity46 's bucket list : @entity91 , which is very expensive and requires a significant time commitment ; return visits to @entity184 , her first and always love ; and the @entity180 , where she has traveled but wishes to see again			0
and for the history buff , nature lover or luxury traveler , there 's @entity41 , where the high life , nature and history can be found @entity192			1
@entity46 recommends getting to @entity41 before the sense of @entity14 occupation can be found only in museums dedicated to remembering the past			1
" sometimes , they 're so successfully erasing the period @entity14 were there to the extent you wonder if they were ever there ; and other times , you think , ' oh , here i can still feel it , ' " @entity46 said			1
" you 'd never know in many cases in @entity205 that the @entity14 had been there			1
in the back roads of @entity208 , you 'd think it 's still under @entity14 control			1

no longer *dominated* by the @entity14 , @entity41 has the old and the new to discover
the nervous or *novice* traveler can still find very safe places to explore
adventurers can go to cultures completely different from their own , solo or with a tour
