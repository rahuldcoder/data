@entity0 -- despite mounting pressure from some lawmakers and dissent within the ranks of his top advisers , president @entity4 decided not to release photos of @entity13 's dead body , a @entity3 spokesman said wednesday			1
" it is not in our national security interest ... to allow these images to become icons to rally opinion against the @entity22 , " @entity3 press secretary @entity14 told reporters			1
" we have no need to publish those photographs to establish that @entity13 was killed , " he said			2
shortly after @entity22 officials announced the decision , a news agency published photographs it said were taken by a @entity30 security official shortly after the raid			1
the images , published by @entity33 wednesday , showed three men lying in pools of blood and the wreckage of a @entity22 helicopter abandoned during the assault			2
none of the pictures appeared to show @entity13 's dead body			2
@entity3 officials remained firm in their assertion that releasing graphic photos of @entity13 could incite more violence			1
to further explain the controversial choice , @entity14 read @entity4 's remarks from the transcript of a wednesday afternoon interview			2
" that 's not who we are			2
we do n't trot out this stuff as trophies			2
the fact of the matter is that this is someone who is deserving of the justice he received			2
... we do n't need to spike the football , " @entity4 told @entity61			2
@entity4 's decision settles the debate over whether the @entity22 will release the images			1
but opinions about whether the @entity22 government 's photographs should be public were anything but unanimous among @entity22 lawmakers and members of the public at home and abroad			1
some argued releasing the images would put to rest any critics or conspiracy theories , while others countered that the graphic photos would only inflame jihadists			1
a senior @entity81 official close to the @entity3 told @entity1 that the president was " never in favor " of releasing the photos , even as @entity86 chief @entity85 made it sound like their release was imminent			1
@entity14 said @entity4 consulted @entity90 and security officials before he made his choice wednesday morning , and a majority of them weighed in against releasing the photographs			1
secretary of defense @entity96 and secretary of state @entity98 were among those who supported @entity4 's inclination to keep the pictures classified , the senior @entity81 official said			1
but @entity85 said tuesday he thought a photograph of @entity13 's body would be released at some point			2
" i just think it 's important -- they know we have it -- to release it , " the @entity86 director said			0
the president 's inner circle was not happy with those remarks , the senior @entity81 official said			1
but a senior @entity4 administration official said debates over the pros and cons of releasing the photos were " not at all contentious			1
" the official admitted that " leaks are possible , " but said that did not sway the president from reaching his decision			1
@entity14 stressed that @entity4 wanted to hear differing perspectives to inform his choice			0
" he wanted to hear the opinions of others , but he was very clear about his view on this , " @entity14 said			0
" there are obviously arguments to be made on either side			0
" @entity134 sen. @entity133 of @entity135 called the decision a " mistake			1
" " i know @entity13 is dead			0
but the best way to protect and defend our interests overseas is to prove that fact to the rest of the world , " he said in a written statement			0
" i 'm afraid the decision made today by president @entity4 will unnecessarily prolong this debate			1
" rep. @entity148 , @entity149 , also said @entity4 made the wrong choice about the photos			1
" i want to see them , personally , " he said			0
" i did three tours			0
i 'm not talking as a member of the @entity155 -- ( but ) as a @entity156 who did three tours because of 9/11			0
as @entity22 we deserve to see them			0
" but @entity3 minority whip @entity158 , a @entity160 @entity159 , said he shares the president 's view			1
" in my opinion , there 's no end served by releasing a picture of someone who has been killed , and i think there is absolute proof that @entity13 was in fact the person ... killed , " he said			1
lawmakers involved in national security began debating the issue well before @entity4 's decision			1
the top @entity134 on the @entity176 has argued they should be made public right away			0
" i think the question is , what 's the negative that could come from it ? " asked sen. @entity177 of @entity178			0
" one of these days they 're going to be released ; it 's a question of whether it be now on our terms or ( let ) somebody else do it			0
" sen. @entity190 , @entity191 , who chairs the @entity155 -- and who has not seen the photos -- had argued that the @entity22 should wait to allow the emotions of people around the world who may be sympathetic to @entity13 to cool down			1
" i 'd let a little time pass so we that we do n't play into the hands of people who want to retaliate with what obviously will be a sensational picture			0
i would not want to feed that sensation , so i 'd wait days or weeks , " he said			0
@entity204 @entity81 sen. @entity203 suggested temporarily keeping the photos confidential , but releasing them eventually			1
in a letter sent to the @entity3 wednesday , he proposed establishing a review process " to release all relevant photographs as early as 10 years from now , " or when the president " determines their release would no longer endanger the lives of @entity22			1
" while some @entity134 leaders criticized @entity4 , the debate over the photographs did not entirely split along party lines			0
@entity134 @entity219 chairman @entity218 of @entity191 said he was against releasing any photos , saying that he did n't want to make the job of @entity22 troops abroad " any harder than it already is			1
" " imagine how the @entity22 people would react if @entity224 killed one of our troops or military leaders , and put photos of the body on the @entity231			1
@entity13 is not a trophy -- he is dead and let 's now focus on continuing the fight until @entity224 has been eliminated , " he said			0
@entity236 chairman @entity235 , a @entity134 from @entity237 who has argued that the photographs should not be classified , said he understood @entity4 's call			0
" while i have said that a photo release may be a good way to combat the predictable conspiracy theories about @entity13 's death , this is a decision for the president to make , and i respect his decision , " he said in a statement			1
@entity4 's choice comes as a poll shows that a majority of @entity22 support making the photographs public			0
in a @entity255 poll released tuesday , 56 % of those asked said yes , the government should release a photo of @entity13 's body			0
another 39 % said no. the poll of 700 adults had a sampling margin of 3.5 %			0
the government has said it matched dna to confirm that the body was @entity13 's , and most have accepted that news as evidence of the outcome of the operation			1
some groups , however -- including the @entity271 -- have questioned the assertion			0
" @entity4 has not got any strong evidence that can prove his claim over killing of the @entity277 , " @entity271 spokesman @entity273 said			2
" and secondly , the closest sources for @entity277 have not confirmed " the death			0
and at a university in the affluent @entity30 town where @entity22 officials say troops killed @entity13 , a group of students clamored to tell @entity1 why they doubted the @entity224 leader had been killed in the raid			1
" if it is true , then why they are not showing his body ? " one asked			0
similar doubt and demands for evidence that @entity13 is dead echoed on the streets of @entity297			2
" i believe this is all fake , " one man said			0
" wherever he is , he 's alive			0
" but the @entity3 has dismissed such criticisms			1
" there are going to be some folks who deny it			0
the fact of the matter is , you will not see @entity13 walking on this @entity307 again , " @entity4 told @entity61			0
none of the photos published by @entity33 appeared to show @entity13			2
one photo shows a man , clad in a t - shirt , lying in a large pool of blood that appears to spread from the back of his head			0
two other men pictured appear to have died from extensive head and chest wounds			0
the @entity3 has received three sets of photographs , according to a senior @entity22 official			1
one batch , which clearly shows @entity13 's body , was taken at a hangar in @entity328 , the official said			2
the official described one of the images as a clear , but gruesome , picture of the @entity224 leader 's face			2
@entity13 is shown with a massive open head wound across both eyes , the official said , adding that the image would not be appropriate for the front pages of newspapers			2
the other photos include the raid on the compound and @entity13 's burial at sea , according to the official			1
@entity1 's @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 , @entity353 , @entity354 , @entity355 and @entity356 contributed to this report .			0
