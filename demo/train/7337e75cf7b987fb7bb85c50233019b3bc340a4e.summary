, self - worth , authenticity and employee meditation rooms might conjure up thoughts of new age healing centers			1
but the benefits of tapping employees ' emotional happiness mean the ideas are now being picked up by mainstream corporations			1
@entity13 , one of @entity15 ' s oldest and most successful boutique hotel chains , is one business discovering the benefits of @entity19 , the chain 's ceo , says he introduced the strategy to shift the company 's culture			2
@entity19 points to a reluctance , at times , of staff members to engage with customers , to sell its products and promote the brand			2
" the front desk is like a stop sign they do n't go beyond , " he says			2
now , @entity33 is sending all hotel employees through @entity3 training to help them become more open and confident , understand their own limitations and fears , and to boost their self - worth and comfort in dealing with other people			1
attendees get a full @entity3 profile of themselves , which helps break down how they relate to others , their level of empathy , authenticity , and leadership abilities			1
this information is used to improve their communication with others			2
the classes also , typically , include meditation or visualization practices			2
@entity33 uses it to " empower [ employees ] and make them more of the great people they already are			1
" he adds , " it gives us a very open , expressive work environment , where people are not afraid to speak up and where everyone [ is ] bringing solutions to the table			2
" @entity66 , managing director of @entity67 , which has trained around 7,000 business leaders across @entity69 , helped customize the @entity71 hotels training programs			1
" we teach people how to actively and intelligently use their feelings in the development of individuals and teams , " @entity66 says			2
but do feelings really have a place in business ? yes , @entity66 says			2
" from kids we 're taught to disregard our feelings , to stop crying when we fall , and to sit still and be quiet			2
we accept that and we work with that			2
it sounds simple but for most people this takes training			1
" he adds , " what often limit us are our own attitudes and beliefs , and that 's where @entity3 can be really powerful			1
you ca n't be a good salesperson if you 're convinced you 're not			0
" at @entity98 's division of @entity99 , a @entity100 company and worldwide leader in construction markets , @entity67 was asked to help improve cooperation and team work			0
" it was a bit like a schoolyard sometimes , ' says procurement director @entity108			0
" people would have disagreements , not take responsibility and not know how to resolve things			0
but , we now have a far better atmosphere , we communicate openly , we deal with problems as they come up , and we move forward			0
" he adds , " if someone feels bad about a decision i make , i stop and think about that			0
you ca n't argue with somebody 's feelings			0
in business we talk so much about key numbers and economic models , but the best solutions are often made when we reflect and cooperate			1
" @entity128 , ceo of @entity98 , a multi-national wholesale organization says @entity3 is so important that they 've built the @entity67 training into their leadership programme			1
" just think about the last big decision you made			0
how much of it was based in emotion and how much was based in intellect ? most all big decisions are based in both			0
" the research into @entity3 was pioneered by @entity139 , professor of psychology at the @entity141 , together with dr. @entity142			1
he defines it as " the capacity to reason about emotional information and the capacity of emotional information to enhance thinking			1
" historically , placing weight on emotions has been dismissed			0
" what 's remarkable is that for so many years , people did n't see emotions as conveying important messages , " he says			0
" for much of the 19th and 20th century there was a constant emphasis on the cognitive			0
emotions were seen as irrational and as interfering with the logical			0
but @entity3 is key to relationships and provides an adaptive advantage and smooth social abilities , " he adds			1
@entity66 says it can be implemented in the workforce by using feelings actively in personal and team development , strengthening the self worth in individuals and teams by acknowledging what people do , and to constructing a " no bull - shit " culture for dealing with conflict			1
at @entity13 , @entity19 says that 's exactly what they do			0
" it 's okay to tell someone you 're having a bad day , or an issue with something they did			0
and , as a leader , it 's important to show people who you really are , to be yourself			0
you get a whole different kind of leader that way			0
all those things that are typically taboo , they are not taboo here			0
" and as @entity3 gains ground , those taboos may begin to drop elsewhere too			1
@entity139 has noticed a sea change in acceptance of @entity3 in recent years			1
" when i was a kid people talked a lot about your intelligence as something cognitive , but i think that in the future @entity3 will become a second measure of intelligence			1
" still , he says , @entity3 is no substitute for standard intelligence			1
" i usually make the case that as long as my engineers can build a bridge that wo n't fall down , i do n't care if they 're emotionally intelligent			0
