-- if you 're among the companies vying for one of the nearly 2,000 new generic top - level domains , or @entity5 , you 've got big pockets			2
the application alone costs about $ 185,000			2
but if you 're just an average @entity10 building your own website or blog , there are much cheaper options out there			2
one of the most popular is			2
it 's a country code top - level domain , similar to			1
tk stands for a country you 've probably never heard of			1
places don '' t get much more remote than @entity22			1
it would make a great backdrop for a desert - island television series			2
the only problem would be getting the crew there			2
what appears on a map as three tiny pinpoints in the midst of the @entity36 are the country 's tiny atolls , bringing the total size of @entity22 to a whopping 4 square miles			1
if you want to get there , you will start in @entity42 and fly to @entity43			1
from @entity43 , you 'll fly to @entity44			1
from @entity44 , you 'll take a small plane to @entity44 , where you might wait two weeks for a boat			2
the boat ride is 48 hours , and there 's no cabin , so you 'll sleep on the deck			1
the boat will get you close to @entity22 , but the sea is too rough and the coral too dangerous to approach , so you 'll hop in a canoe and paddle to shore			1
now , you 're ready to start your island holiday			0
@entity22 is home to only about 1,300 people			1
but a recent report ( @entity60 ) released by @entity61 , the global registry operator for			0
com and .net , found that			0
tk is the third-most popular country code top - level domain ( or @entity67 ) behind only @entity68 (			1
de ) and the @entity69 (			0
it 's all thanks to a man who literally lives on the other side of the planet from @entity22 : @entity75 of @entity76			1
around 2000 , @entity75 says , he and a friend looked at @entity78 as inspiration for a business model of their own			0
if @entity78 could make money providing free e-mail , could n't money be made offering free domains ? " at that moment , there were no free domain names yet , " @entity75 said			1
" so we were shopping around for a registry that wanted to play along , and in the end , we founded			0
tk , which did n't exist at the time			0
" @entity75 says it was n't easy			0
the @entity96 were not only unaware of their entitlement to their own country code domain , no one on the island had ever seen a webpage before			1
" we had to explain to them what they had and what the @entity103 was in order to get things going , " @entity75 said			0
there was also another small problem			0
@entity109 , the group responsible for doling out @entity67 , did n't believe that @entity22 really existed			1
luckily for @entity75 , an @entity109 board member informed the rest of the group that he had installed the island 's first shortwave radio equipment there in the late 1970s			1
so the two sides agreed to the deal			0
after some handshakes in @entity117 , @entity75 took the long , faithful journey to @entity22 with satellite equipment in tow			1
it took more than two weeks to get there , and he had to keep the equipment dry			0
otherwise he risked having to repeat the long , expensive and exhausting journey			0
after six years of hurdles and complicated setup , @entity124 launched its			0
now , more than 9 million websites have			1
tk domains , and @entity75 says there 's been a recent explosion of popularity , with about a million added each month			1
" we have never seen such enormous growth , " @entity75 said			0
" the growth is coming especially from emerging economies like @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140			0
these countries also have local @entity67 's like			2
cn , but these are very hard to register for the local communities there , so they go to			0
" @entity124 makes money through ads on expired domains			0
@entity75 says registration and renewal are free for users , but when they abandon the site or do n't meet the minimum requirements of 25 unique visitors every 90 days , the domain gets " parked			2
" that means the url still exists , but the content is replaced with ads tailored to the original site			0
" if your website was about your trip to @entity166 , we have spiders that go through all of the live websites , and the moment the live website expires , we take the domain name back , " @entity75 said			1
" we then put ads on there that are relevant to the content that was there before			0
in this case , your trip to @entity166			0
" @entity124 gives a cut of the money it earns to the people of @entity22			1
in fact , one - sixth of their economy comes from the sale of			2
@entity22 , however , has the smallest gdp in the world : about $ 1.2 million a year			1
through @entity124 , @entity75 did n't just bring hard cash to the people of @entity22 , he brought connectivity			1
" they had four phone lines , and that was basically it , " he said			1
" they had dial - up , but there was such a slow bandwidth , they could only use it for e-mails without any attachments			0
if there was any attachment , they had to actually make a call to @entity117 to remove the attachment , because otherwise , the e-mail would n't get through			0
" besides the annual license fees , @entity124 provides internet service to @entity22 with that satellite equipment @entity75 brought with him			1
he says it costs about $ 2,000 a month for the same connection that would cost about $ 10 in the @entity213 " we brought them the connectivity , and now there are 120 computers on the island , mostly laptops , because the power goes off at 10 p.m. , " he said			0
though it still may be almost impossible to find , @entity22 's profile has been raised , thanks to @entity124			1
and now with new investment in his company , @entity75 hopes to do the same in @entity227			0
he spoke from a train bound for @entity229 , where he was to meet with representatives of seven countries			0
@entity75 wo n't say which ones , but he says that in the next two months , the first one will go live			2
that means that not only will there be a few new top - level domains , there will probably be more than a few people in those countries seeing a website for the first time .			2

@entity22 is only 4 square miles , but 9 million websites have the country 's domain
no planes fly to @entity22 , and the islands have four phone lines and one satellite
only about 1,300 people live in @entity22 , which has the smallest economy in the world
