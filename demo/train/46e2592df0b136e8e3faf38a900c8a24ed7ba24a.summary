@entity2 @entity1 crown prince @entity0 celebrated his 55th birthday by weighing in on the current controversies swirling around @entity1 's wartime past			1
at a news conference on february 23rd , @entity0 stated , " i myself did not experience the war ... but i think that it is important today , when memories of the war are fading , to look back humbly on the past and correctly pass on the tragic experiences and history @entity1 pursued from the generation which experienced the war to those without direct knowledge			1
" his remarks might seem unobjectionable , but in the oblique and abstract lexicon of the @entity23 , he has fired shots across the bow of prime minister @entity26 and his fellow revisionists			1
the @entity23 almost never strays into political affairs due to constitutional constraints , but @entity30 has on occasion stretched his tether to its limits , and when he has done so it has always been to repudiate right - wingers who prefer to think they are acting in his name			0
it appears that his son is letting it be known that the @entity23 remains steadfast on the issue of war responsibility , following up his father 's similar rebuke at the beginning of january			0
prince @entity0 's remarks were in response to a question regarding the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity49 in august this year , and comes amid feverish speculation about what @entity26 intends to include and exclude from his pending statement on that occasion			1
so when the prince talks about the need for humility and correctness in assessing wartime @entity1 , and passing on the lessons of that tragedy to future generations , many @entity1 understand his ineffable message calling on @entity26 to tread carefully			1
it is for us pundits to say what he ca n't : " humbly " means not glorifying this inglorious past , while " correctly " means not ignoring all the evidence of @entity1 aggression and war crimes			1
future generations , in his view , deserve to understand all that went wrong instead of the chest - thumping , valorizing revisionist history favored by the reactionaries who hold political power in @entity1			2
given @entity26 's woeful track record on history , this pointed reminder is useful and also demonstrates that @entity0 is ready to take on a bigger role when it is time to do so , and that he plans to continue @entity30 's reconciliation activism			1
recently , tabloid conservatives questioned whether he was up to the job so this may be a riposte to his critics			0
the problem about interpreting the utterances of @entity1 's royals is that bureaucrats vet everything they say , and the wording of statements is intentionally ambiguous to provide plausible deniability			2
the deliberately veiled vagueness , however , can not disguise the symbolism of the royals expressing their unease about wartime history two months in a row precisely at a time when @entity26 is under intensified scrutiny			2
this unprecedented double rebuke is not a coincidence			0
ironically , they both obliquely censure military aggression during the reign of @entity109 , @entity0 's grandfather , while @entity26 frequently invokes his own grandfather , @entity110 , as an inspiration			2
this is jarring given that @entity110 was a " @entity114 " war crimes suspect -- although never indicted or even tried -- for his record of mobilizing forced labor in @entity117 and prominent role as minister of munitions from 1941 - 45			0
@entity26 recently appointed a committee of advisers to provide input on his 70th anniversary statement			1
their views wo n't really matter , but it is politically useful that @entity26 is at least going through the motions of asking the opinion of other eminent people even though none of them is remotely likely to challenge his revisionist views			0
the @entity1 media is riveted by @entity26 's vacillating remarks regarding the content of the forthcoming statement because the implications are potentially explosive for regional relations			1
@entity139 and @entity140 will carefully scrutinize his words for any sign of backsliding on war responsibility and expressions of remorse			0
@entity146 has also made it clear that @entity26 will undermine @entity149 relations if he does n't come clean on war guilt			0
@entity26 thus faces tremendous international pressure to swallow his deeply felt views on the wartime issue , but domestic opinion is more divided			0
under @entity26 there has been a resurgence of jingoistic nationalism -- rightwing extremists have become emboldened , attacking the liberal press , threatening journalists and academics , and engaging in hate speech targeting @entity1 's ethnic @entity164 minority			1
they have done so with virtual impunity			0
@entity26 's core constituencies are eager to see him redeem the unredeemable and members of reactionary groups such as @entity169 ( dubbed @entity1 's @entity170 ) and the @entity171 dominate his cabinet , and share his views on history and shaking off the shackles of the past			1
in defiance of majority public opinion , they also support his security agenda of boosting defense cooperation with the @entity149 and eliminating constitutional curbs on @entity1 's military forces			2
the gathering forces of darkness apparent in @entity26 's @entity1 are troubling to the nation 's friends and allies because they are incrementally eroding the foundations of liberal democracy			1
against this backdrop , @entity1 's besieged liberals welcome the moral support given by @entity30 and @entity0			2
but will the royal reproaches matter ? since the 1995 @entity196 commemorating the 50th anniversary of @entity49 's end , all @entity1 leaders have dutifully repeated then - prime minister @entity200 's heartfelt apology and expression of remorse			1
this statement has thus become a benchmark against which the @entity205 will be judged			0
@entity200 , 89 , recently reassured @entity164 leaders that @entity26 would uphold his statement , but doubts linger because @entity26 has been evasive and waffling about what he plans to say			0
he has said he will generally uphold the statement , but this provides room for caveats and ellipses			0
it is precisely his disputing of the historical details that lands @entity26 in hot water as he questions what the term aggression means , quibbles about the level of coercion used in recruiting comfort women and in january expressed outrage about what he deems inaccurate accounts of the comfort women in a @entity149 history textbook			0
the @entity23 understands that @entity26 risks undermining @entity1 's dignity and isolating it from neighbors and allies			1
by expressing their concerns about war memory , both royals seek to steer @entity1 back onto the course of reconciliation and a brighter future			0
in doing so they provide political cover for @entity26 to disappoint his jingoistic supporters and make the right call on the past .			2

@entity1 's crown prince urges subjects to " look back humbly on the past and correctly pass on the tragic experiences and history " of @entity49
comments have been taken as a rebuke to prime minister @entity26 , often seen as a revisionist
@entity26 will soon make a statement regarding the @entity49 's 70th anniversary
anything but conciliatory language in @entity26 's statement could be potentially explosive for regional relations
