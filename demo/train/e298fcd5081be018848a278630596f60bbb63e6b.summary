-- the world record long jump of 29 feet , 4 1/4 inches , set by @entity4 @entity3 , has stood for nearly 22 years			1
that imposing distance is nearly five times @entity3 's 6 - foot - 2 height			2
but an athletic , evolved guppy would scoff at that accomplishment , if you can consider guppies athletic			0
the popular pet fish can jump up to eight times their body length , at speeds of more than 4 feet per second , according to a recently published research paper in the online peer - reviewed journal @entity17			1
@entity20 biologist @entity19 and biology lecturer @entity21 discovered the guppies ' ability while using high - speed videography and digital imaging to analyze the jumping behavior of nine guppies from a wild @entity29 species , @entity30 , related to the familiar pet - shop fish			1
while studying evolutionary changes to the guppies ' brain stems , one of the fish jumped out of a laboratory tank and into @entity19 ' cup of iced chai , prompting closer scrutiny , she said			2
@entity19 and @entity21 reported the jumping guppies started from a still position , swam backwards slowly , then changed direction and hurtled into the air			0
no researcher has ever reported seeing a fish preparing to jump like that , @entity19 and @entity21 said			0
the @entity49 researchers concluded that while many fish launch out of the water into the air to capture prey , migrate , or avoid predators , the guppies have a different evolutionary motive : to reach all the available habitat in @entity58 's mountain streams			1
by dispersing , guppies move away from areas of heavy predation , minimize competition with one another and keep the species ' genetic variability high , the researchers said			0
that probably comes as no consolation to your children if their guppies jump out of their fish bowl			2
but at least now , you 'll have a plausible explanation .			0

@entity76 of @entity49 researchers say they *'ve* witnessed never - before - seen behavior in fish
guppies jump by *swimming* backwards , then changing direction and launching
the biology *professor* and lecturer say the fish can jump eight times their body length
the best human long jumper ever , @entity3 , jumped nearly five times his height
