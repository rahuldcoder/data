-- " there is a nasty bug going around , " wrote @entity3 on her blog back in january			0
" a lot of my friends have been bitten by it and it is highly contagious			2
" indeed , it is contagious -- particularly among women			0
some might call it addictive , even			0
nevertheless , no , this article does n't belong in the health section			0
because the bug that 's infected @entity19 , her friends and thousands of women around the world is called @entity20			1
and there 's no known cure			0
@entity20 , for the uninitiated , is a highly visual website that lets users collect -- or " pin " -- items from around the @entity27			1
the main thing that separates it from older social bookmarking sites , such as del.icio.us , is its emphasis on images			2
and it 's that visual interest that makes @entity20 -- created by three men , by the way -- so popular among women , whether they 're planning a wedding or looking for a craft to try with their girlfriends			1
@entity20 grew 400 % from september to december last year , and the site 's users are about 58 % women			1
why the appeal ? pinterest user and social media consultant @entity46 thinks she knows the answer : " everything on @entity20 looks so appealing , so gorgeous , so effortless , " she wrote on @entity50			2
" and somehow merely viewing these amazing things makes us feel that we can elevate ourselves and -- heck -- our lives to that level of sophistication , creativity and beauty if only we could make / wear / cook / say / invent those things too			0
" pinboards , then , serve as inspiration for those who create them			0
but do those beautiful boards result in any real - life change or creativity ? @entity46 is skeptical , and even pinterest addict @entity19 admits that she usually spends more time pinning than doing			1
" the problem with @entity20 , though , is that i spend a lot of time pinning , pinning , pinning and not enough time trying , trying , trying , " she wrote on her blog			2
so she decided to challenge herself with a venture she 's calling 52 weeks of @entity73 , during which she 'll try out a different @entity20 - inspired project each week and blog about her experience and results .			1
