@entity0 -- when @entity4 conducts an underground nuclear test , a vast array of global sensors will detect the detonation almost immediately			1
but key questions about the size of the explosion , the number of bombs tested , or whether plutonium or uranium was used , may never be answered conclusively , analysts say			1
@entity4 appears to have conducted an underground nuclear bomb test tuesday , as the @entity16 reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime 's two previous nuclear tests			1
the area around the reported epicenter of the magnitude 4.9 disturbance has little or no history of earthquakes or natural seismic hazards , according to @entity16 maps			0
despite international condemnation , @entity4 has said it would conduct its third underground nuclear test			1
a third nuclear test could enable @entity4 the technical data needed to miniaturize a warhead , according to a recent paper in the " @entity35			1
" coming on the heels of december 's successful launch of a satellite , the threat of an atomic test has raised concerns			0
@entity43 's efforts seemed hapless when a rocket launch failed earlier in 2012			2
but its spotty record changed in early december when @entity4 launched the long - range @entity47 rocket carrying a satellite , showing the world it had the technology to launch a long - range missile -- with analysts suggesting parts of the @entity55 , @entity43 's stated arch rival , were now within range			1
following the @entity59 condemnation of the launch in january , @entity43 says it plans a new nuclear test and further long - range rocket launches			1
" an additional nuclear test or two would greatly increase the likelihood that @entity43 could fashion warheads to fit at least some of its missiles -- a circumstance that would vastly increase the threat its nuclear program poses to the security of @entity75 , " wrote analyst @entity63 and @entity64 , a @entity65 professor who visited @entity4 nuclear sites in 2010			1
how does an underground test work ? satellite photos showed the preparation of a third tunnel in @entity80 , located 232 kilometers northeast of @entity43 near the @entity81 , where the two previous tests were located			1
@entity83 appeared to begin in 2009 and now is largely completed			0
analysts estimate the new tunnel is one kilometer long and 380 meters deep			0
tests are typically conducted in vertical shafts , according to the @entity88 for the @entity89 ( @entity90 )			2
holes are cut 1 to 3 meters wide and up to a kilometer deep			0
the atomic devices are assembled on site and placed in the hole , usually accompanied by lead - protected diagnostic canister that contains sensors to record the explosion			2
the tunnel is then filled with layers of pea gravel , sand and other materials to prevent radioactive material from being released into the atmosphere			0
during a test , the explosion energy is released in less than a millionth of a second , according to @entity90			0
the temperature will reach about a million degrees within a few microseconds , and shockwaves from the blast , depending on the size , can be detected by seismographs around the planet			0
is underground testing dangerous ? of the more than 2,000 nuclear detonations since 1945 , 75 % of the explosions have been tests conducted underground , largely by the major nuclear powers of the @entity55 , the @entity121 ( now @entity122 ) , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , according to the @entity90			1
underground testing is much safer than above - ground testing			0
" with underground testing , you can contain the radiation , " said @entity128 , @entity90 spokesperson			0
still , nuclear particles can be accidentally released into the atmosphere			0
@entity4 's first nuclear test in 2006 leaked radiation into the air which was picked up at a @entity90 monitoring station in @entity138 , @entity139 -- more than 4,500 miles away			1
there is always a danger of radiation seeping , hence the total test ban treaty , @entity128 said			0
" the @entity55 tried to control radiation release with its underground tests , but in 150 cases radiation was released into the atmosphere , " @entity128 said			1
but if @entity43 plans to explode an even larger device , risks elevate as well			2
" one of the risks @entity43 takes in trying to demonstrate a test at a higher level is that they may produce fissures that allow radioactive seepage or possibly cause a major blowout from the tunnel , " @entity64 wrote in @entity151 on february 4			2
" the @entity55 testing program experienced such problems even after having conducted hundreds of tests			0
unrecognized complex geological conditions apparently led to a blowout during the 1970 underground @entity166 nuclear test at the @entity167			2
the blowout released a radioactive cloud nearly 10,000 feet high			0
" such a blowout would also release a lot more data on the test to outside observers , but " spewing a radioactive cloud over the skies of @entity75 would create an enormous political storm from the nearby countries , " @entity64 wrote			0
why is underground testing controversial ? @entity4 is the only country to have carried out atomic explosions on the planet since 1998 , when @entity43 conducted underground nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009			1
before that , both @entity181 and @entity182 conducted underground tests in 1998 , according to @entity90			1
the 1996 treaty , which has been signed by 183 nations , aims to ban all nuclear testing on the planet , whether in the atmosphere or underground			2
while the comprehensive test ban treaty has n't formally become law ( it awaits ratification by @entity125 , @entity193 , @entity181 , @entity195 @entity194 , @entity4 , @entity182 and the @entity55 ) , only @entity4 , @entity181 and @entity182 have broken the moratorium on nuclear testing , according to the @entity90			1
testing in the atmosphere and underwater was banned by the 1963 @entity200 , after public concerns over radioactive fallout from tests			0
the @entity55 , the @entity121 and @entity123 signed the treaty , but nuclear powers @entity124 and @entity125 did not			0
@entity124 conducted its last above ground nuclear test in 1974 ; @entity125 in 1980			0
to develop the technology for its atomic weapons program , @entity4 needs to conduct tests to perfect the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon so that it can be mounted on a missile , delivered without mishap and hit its intended target			1
how will we know if @entity4 carries out an underground test ? once a nuclear device is exploded , seismographs around the world will detect the movement			1
" manmade explosions have a very different signature than natural events , " @entity128 said			0
" seismic technology is the core function of any monitoring system , and we are running the only international system that is dedicated to ensure that no nuclear explosion will go undetected in compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty			1
" the @entity90 operates a global system of more than 300 monitors -- such as seismic , sonar or radiation sensors -- in 85 countries across the world			2
even if no radiation escapes into the atmosphere , underground explosions leak noble gases into the atmosphere which @entity90 sensors can detect , @entity128 said .			2

a vast array of global sensors will detect any @entity4 nuclear detonation almost immediately
key questions about the size of explosion and the number of bombs tested may never be known
underground tests are used to help @entity43 perfect technology to deploy a working atom bomb
tests " increase the likelihood that @entity43 could fashion warheads to fit at least some of its missiles "
