-- soon after @entity1 hosted " @entity2 , " i remember asking my friend @entity4 , a fellow " @entity6 " fanatic , what he thought of all the fuss around @entity1 's meteoric comeback			2
he rolled his eyes , shrugged , and said , " it 's just weird that everybody 's finally come around to realizing that @entity1 is amazing			2
where have they been ? " he was right : the recent trend of people catching on to the fact that @entity1 is terrific felt patronizing , and not just because most were astonished that an adorable old lady could land a joke better than most " snl " hosts one - third her age ( i 'm talking about you , @entity24 ) ; it was the belated appreciation of @entity1 's fabulousness that made all of us look even sillier			1
the @entity0 : celeb twins - 10 famous females who come in pairs and now , there 's @entity32			1
rivers , younger than @entity1 by over a decade , has been working steadily since the 1950s , and , after this week 's release of a great new documentary about her life , " @entity32 : a piece of @entity42 , " she is poised to become the @entity38 -- for those who needed 60 years to catch on to the fact that she is wonderful			1
the @entity0 : 6 celeb couples dish on their ( cheap ! ) first dates unlike @entity1 , @entity46 did n't have the benefit of starring in a series of beloved television shows , nor did she play characters as affable , matronly , or warmly dotty			1
rivers honed her act as a stand - up in the 1960s , when few other women had the guts to talk about not being desired by men on stage or joke about women who were flying to @entity59 for illegal abortions on " the @entity61			2
" the @entity0 : 10 stars who ( maybe ) have secret babies since then , she 's worked consistently -- if one seeks out her entry on @entity66 , you ca n't find more than three years in a row where she has n't had a tv show			2
this is because @entity46 , who defines happiness as a full appointment book , does n't have the luxury of turning down projects that are n't classy , or cushy , or critically celebrated ; she 'll sell her jewelry on @entity75 ; she 'll do commercials and perform on a cruise ship			0
she would wake up early , shoot an episode of her own tv show , or do a guest spot on another one , wrap for the day , then get downtown in time to do her weekly stand - up show at the @entity84			0
@entity32 loves to work , and she 'll stop only when she 's dead			1
the @entity0 : 8 celebrity dudes describe their dream women so why did it take so long for audiences to respect not just her work ethic , but to realize how talented she is ? based on the reactions so far to her documentary film " @entity97 , " it seems that what people find most shocking is that she is actually one of the funniest -- and edgiest -- in the comedy biz			1
@entity99 , in @entity98 , remarked how , after watching her stand - up in the film , he was " ready to be her slave , " and added , " i never knew she worked this blue , that she had this much @entity105 in her			0
" the @entity0 : is " @entity107 " @entity106 really single ? a lot of the delayed appreciation for @entity32 has to do with the contempt familiarity breeds			1
she 's never left our sights , and even appeared more and more on our tv screen ( winning " @entity115 " last year ) over the years			0
and , why should she leave showbiz ? her act is as resilient as her energy level , which , at 77 , is enviable			0
but , like anything else in comedy , @entity46 ' comeback is also about timing			0
as @entity46 ' agent says in the film , @entity32 knows that in order to get hit by lightning , you have to stand in the rain			1
and after 60 years of getting soaking wet , @entity46 is about to get struck again where she stands -- feet planted firmly , and not going anywhere			0
the @entity0 : 10 famous men stayed with their mistresses @entity133 all rights reserved			0

@entity32 has been working steadily since the 1950s
" a @entity141 " shows she is actually one of the funniest people in the *business*
the delayed appreciation for her has to do with the contempt familiarity breeds
