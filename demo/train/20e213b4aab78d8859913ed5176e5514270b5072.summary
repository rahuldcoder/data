@entity0 , @entity1 -- my son has a new video game , and i have a new problem			0
i want him to clean his room , and i tell him that he can do it when the game is over			0
my problem is that , as he informed me recently , this game is never over			0
it just keeps going on to new levels , with new challenges			0
that reminds me of the immigration debate			2
in the vortex of @entity22 and @entity23 , pundits and policy makers are once again dangling the possibility that @entity25 could pass immigration reform soon			1
we 've been hearing that immigration reform is around the corner at various times over the years , since @entity32 kicked off this debate in september 2001 when he welcomed then - @entity35 president @entity34 to the @entity36 for a state dinner and the leaders announced that their countries would seek an accord to match workers with employers			1
a dozen years later , we 're still haggling over legalizing the undocumented -- and much more			0
but guess what ? there is action on immigration in @entity49 , only it 's not happening at the federal level			1
in @entity52 , gov. @entity51 is expected to sign this week a bill that would allow undocumented immigrant college students to pay in - state tuition			0
in @entity1 , the state @entity57 has cleared the way for @entity60 , an undocumented immigrant who went to college and law school and took the bar exam , to receive a law license			0
in @entity66 and @entity67 , lawmakers have in recent years proposed the states create their own guest worker agreements with @entity35 to ensure that employers have access to labor no matter what @entity25 does or does n't do			1
these solutions concocted by the states are n't perfect			1
but at least they 're an attempt to do something , and not wait around while @entity23 does nothing			1
in the @entity84 corridor , most of the media does n't really understand the immigration issue			1
for one thing , they treat it like just another issue , when it is arguably the most divisive issue that @entity49 have confronted since slavery			0
besides , the media hates complexity , and so it tries to oversimplify the immigration issue as being solely about @entity97 obstinacy			2
if only the @entity97 would get on board , the narrative goes , we 'd have immigration reform			1
what about the fact that many democrats oppose granting legal status to the undocumented ? how does that fit into the narrative ? it does n't help that elected officials and advocacy groups are generating fog , and that special interests are putting their own agendas ahead of the needs of those they claim to represent			2
i live in @entity1 , and i spend a lot of time traveling thru the @entity120			0
in @entity125 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 or @entity0 , immigration is n't just an election - year wedge issue but an everyday reality			1
it would be difficult in these places to find anyone who believes that @entity25 is poised to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year			1
everyone knows that @entity25 is more likely to approve major legislation in odd - numbered years , because many members spend much of the even - numbered years either campaigning for re-election or avoiding doing anything risky that might jeopardize their re-election			2
such as legalizing the undocumented			0
if you 're a @entity97 representing a district in the @entity120 or the @entity141 , risky could mean voting for legislation that legalizes the undocumented and puts you crossways with the nativist wing of your party			0
if you 're a @entity149 from the @entity141 or the " @entity150 " states like @entity147 or @entity148 , risky might mean supporting a bill to legalize the undocumented and antagonizing rank - and - file union members who worry about having to compete with newly legalized immigrants for blue - collar jobs			1
so why bother keeping up the charade that immigration reform is just around the corner ? easy			1
in the words of @entity161 , the fictional gunman and stickup man in the @entity164 series , " @entity165 , " it 's because " it 's all in the game			0
" the immigration game is based on three principles : dishonesty , disconnect and divergent interests			2
the game is dishonest , because the participants advance one lie after another , from denying that resistance to immigrants has anything to do with racism to insisting that @entity49 workers would gladly do the worst jobs for the right salary to claiming that immigrants are n't assimilating and so on			2
there is a disconnect between those who argue about reform efforts and those directly impacted by them			1
@entity49 citizens have the luxury of haggling over the details of an immigration reform package , because most of them wo n't be directly affected one way or another			1
and those most affected -- the undocumented -- are n't at the table			2
and there are divergent interests between people who think they 're actually on the same side			2
@entity97 have to watch out that they 're not betrayed by fellow @entity97 , @entity202 by fellow @entity202			0
this issue splits parties and divides coalitions , so it 's every special interest for itself			1
all this is happening on the federal level , and it 's a mess			0
the game is designed to go on indefinitely , in part because politicians and advocacy groups wo n't let it end			1
@entity202 want a wedge issue to use against @entity97 , and they do n't want to be known as the " pro amnesty " party			0
advocacy groups need to keep funds rolling in by convincing supporters that the battle continues and the stakes have never been higher , so they can pay rent and salaries			0
readers often ask me what i would propose by way of an immigration reform plan			1
it includes : improved roadways and better surveillance equipment for the @entity233 , tougher employer sanctions , @entity237 troops on the @entity49 - @entity35 border , a tamper - proof id card , a pathway to earned legal status without including citizenship in the deal but allowing people to pursue it on their own , a 10 - year ban on public benefits for legalized immigrants and their children , an increase in legal immigration , and other reforms			1
yet we ca n't even get to that -- to my plan , or yours -- until we restore honesty , integrity and common sense to the debate			0
and that means ending a game that no one ever wins			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			2

@entity265 says federal action on immigration wo n't materialize in election year
he says states are beginning to take the lead in making changes
the immigration reform efforts in @entity23 fall *victim* to members of both parties , he says
@entity265 : too many people have an interest in blocking immigration reform
