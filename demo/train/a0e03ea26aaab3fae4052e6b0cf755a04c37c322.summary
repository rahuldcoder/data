" i do n't do this just for myself and my family , " the @entity9 's first @entity8 - born player to be drafted declares on his official @entity11 page			1
" i have the whole country on my back			2
" and for @entity1 his success is not just about shouldering that weight of expectation			1

" political tensions @entity1 grew up watching the @entity9 commentator every friday on @entity77 , a @entity78 - based network that broadcast games in @entity8			1
while most scouts saw no reason to take the risk of traveling to the @entity83 , @entity64 often visited the region to bring young , talented athletes back to the @entity48			0
@entity64 , a native of @entity86 , wanted to draw attention to countries where college coaches show little interest			0

after his junior year , he asked for and received a @entity193 hardship waiver to transfer to @entity194 where he competed in his senior year			0
