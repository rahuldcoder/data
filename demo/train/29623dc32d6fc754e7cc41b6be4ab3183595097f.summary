-- " how can @entity1 hire you to be ' @entity3 '' s senior @entity5 correspondent when you do n't even know how to pronounce @entity6 - aikum ? ! " this was the immediate reaction of @entity10 's father after @entity10 told him the news			1
his father then quickly followed up that comment with the admonition , " if @entity1 asks you any questions about @entity19 , do n't say a word , tell him to call your mother , she knows everything			1
and do n't embarrass your entire family from here to @entity25 ... oh , and by the way , we are very proud of you , congratulations			0
" it 's not like @entity10 did n't know anything about being a muslim before he was hired by " @entity3 " in 2006			1
but he was n't that connected to his faith at the time			1
something surprising happened , however , while working on the show for eight years			0
@entity1 made @entity34 more @entity5 - ish			1
in fact , @entity1 did that to both of us			1
we do n't mean in the religious sense			0
in fact , we wrote this article in a bar while drinking beer and eating bacon cheeseburger			0
( okay , it 's an @entity46 's ... and it 's turkey bacon , but you get the point			0
) for millions of @entity49 , including both of us , we are connected more culturally than religiously to our faith			2
it 's not like @entity1 intentionally wanted us to become more @entity5			2
@entity10 did n't come to work one day and find @entity1 sitting in his office holding up the @entity53 , saying , " @entity10 , its time you start boning up on your @entity19			1
" no , it was much more organic			0
in @entity10 's case , covering @entity5 topics for " @entity3 " was the cause			2
you can read all about the experiences in hilarious detail in @entity10 's new book of personal essays titled , " @entity65			2
" ( and yes , that was a shameless plug for the book			0
) for example , there was the time @entity10 was sent to @entity70 , @entity71 , to cover a mosque controversy			2
there he encountered a woman opposed to the mosque who told him that , " one in five @entity49 were terrorists			0
" @entity10 , who at first tried to counter her argument with facts to no avail , finally responded , " well , in that case i ca n't understand what is taking us so long ! " another time the show created a parody sitcom of " @entity86 " titled , " the @entity88 , " about an @entity5 family			1
the reaction from one of the people at the test screening of mostly @entity93 was that the show did n't seem believable enough			0
when @entity10 asked how it could be more so , one person responded with , " what if they had a terrorist uncle who lived in the basement with a goat ? " these @entity3 experiences " radicalized " @entity10 , turning him into , as he calls himself in the book , " the jihadist of irony			1
" the more @entity10 experienced hateful or simply ignorant comments about @entity19 , the more he felt compelled to counter the ignorance and bigotry with missiles of satire on behalf of a group of people who after 9/11 did not have the luxury of being both patriotic and critical of @entity19 at the same time : @entity114 @entity49			1
in @entity116 's case , @entity1 agreed to be a part of the documentary he co-directed with @entity119 , " the muslims are coming ! " this film uses comedy to counter @entity124 bigotry			1
@entity1 being in this film was a big deal			2
first , the last comedy film @entity1 had been in was " @entity128			2
" we are talking years ago			0
but more importantly , with @entity1 's participation , the film was able to find the financing it needed			2
so over the next two years as the film was shot and edited , the sheer immersion in a @entity5 - themed project increased @entity116 's connection to @entity19			1
of all the influences @entity1 had on our " conversion , " the one that truly stands out occurred after death threats had been made against " @entity145 " creators @entity143 and @entity144 for depicting an animated version of the @entity147 on their show			1
@entity1 called @entity34 on the phone -- which was the first time @entity1 ever had called him -- and asked , " how would you feel about talking about the issue on the show as @entity5 ? would you be okay with that ? " @entity10 's father 's words came immediately rushing back to him			1
terrified , he thought for a moment and then asked @entity1 , " can i call my mother ? " later that night , as @entity10 was seated across from @entity1 at " @entity3 " desk waiting for the program to begin , @entity1 leaned over and said to @entity10 , " thanks for doing this , i know you were hesitant			1
" @entity10 responded , " it 's just that i 'm not the best muslim and i ca n't speak for all of @entity19			1
" as the show 's theme music began to play , @entity1 whispered to @entity34 , " i know			0
but right now you 're all we 've got			0
" sometimes being all " we 've got " is all you need			0
and sometimes being all " we 've got " pushes you , even subtly , to be better at it			0
that is what @entity1 did to us			0
so today we both have @entity1 to thank , at least in part , for being able to say that we are now more @entity5 - ish than ever !			0

@entity10 , @entity176 : @entity1 made us more connected to our faith
getting hateful comments about @entity19 made @entity10 want to fight ignorance and bigotry
@entity10 , @entity176 : the connection was more to our culture rather than religion
they use humor and irony to help people understand what it means to be a muslim
