-- based on profits , @entity1 is an outstanding company -- in life insurance sales and hit movies such as the " @entity5 " and " @entity7 " franchises			1
but in the industry where @entity1 made its name -- consumer electronics -- the company needs a lifeline as it finishes its fiscal year with a record $ 6.4 billion loss			1
new ceo @entity14 , who took the helm on april 1 , promised thursday to cut 10,000 jobs -- about 6 % of its workforce -- in the next year			1
moreover , @entity14 is refocusing the business away from its once mighty television division to focus on the core businesses of digital imaging , game and mobile products			0
" our entertainment and financial services are poised for future growth , " @entity14 said			0
" our biggest challenge : rebuilding and future growth of our electronics business			1
( that ) wo n't come about by easy fixes or tricks			0
we must tackle it head - on			0
" the company plans to grow its medical instruments division , he said , and reinvest in research and design			0
" we must surprise customers with innovative projects , that represents @entity1 's return to glory			1
" now is the time for @entity1 to change , " he declared , a refrain throughout the hour - long press conference			2
@entity1 faced the same headwinds battling @entity52 the past year			2
the yen reached record highs , eroding profit margins for export - driven companies			2
natural disasters hit balance sheets , with record floods in @entity60 -- a center for offshore electronics production -- doing as much financial damage as the 2011 @entity65 quake and tsunami for some @entity68 firms			1
@entity1 's annus horribilis was further mired by the hacking of its popular @entity71 , compromising the personal data of more than 77 million users			1
but @entity1 's problems predate these recent woes -- the conglomerate has failed to turn a profit for the past four years			1
" if you look at the automobile industry in @entity68 , it did n't suffer as much as the electronics makers , " said @entity78 , research director for @entity79 in @entity80			1
" so you ca n't just blame the exchange rate -- there 's something else wrong here			0
" the problem , analysts say , represents an existential crisis for @entity1 : does it want to be a content company or a gadget maker ? @entity14 's steps to scale down its television operations were long overdue , analysts said			1
" the television business has n't made any more for the last eight years -- any rational manager would have shut that down by now , " said @entity98 , head of @entity68 equities for @entity100			1
" i do n't know how you can run a business that loses that kind of money			0
" the company 's share price under previous ceo sir @entity110 hit a high of 7,150 yen in may 2007 in the wake of the company 's @entity114 release			1
but the price has dropped nearly 80 % in the past five years			0
" my view on a stock is always relative to its price , and for a long time now there have been better stocks and better companies in almost every line of business that @entity1 is in , save possibly for its financial services business , " @entity98 said			2
for the company that revolutionized the electronics world with low - cost televisions and iconic devices such as the @entity132 , the company 's core business is now an albatross around its neck -- outmaneuvered by more nimble companies such as @entity136 and undercut on price by competitors like @entity139			1
" in the case of electronics , the life cycle is much shorter , there have been a lot of new breakthroughs , " @entity140 said			0
" @entity1 did n't make the right choices when it had to , " such as sticking with plasma televisions while @entity139 threw its resources into making lower - cost lcd models , @entity140 added			1
or letting @entity136 and its @entity151 walk away with the portable music market @entity1 created			0
to be sure , @entity1 has taken steps toward returning to profitability			0
the company has also halved the amount of televisions it 's projected to sell in the next year			2
the company bought out partner @entity159 to try to regain a footing in the smartphone market			0
this month , @entity1 partnered with @entity163 and @entity164 to create @entity165 , a government - backed project to create smartphone displays			0
but @entity1 's real problem , analysts say , is the company 's ability to steer its myriad businesses in the same direction			1
" the number one thing is , they need a very strong control tower like @entity139 and @entity136 , " @entity140 said			0
" if you want to move fast , you have a strong control tower			0
" @entity14 acknowledged this in thursday 's press conference , saying the restructured company will be " one @entity1 , one management			2
" consumers and investors will wait see whether this new head of one of @entity68 's iconic companies can succeed where predecessors have failed			2
@entity0 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report			0
