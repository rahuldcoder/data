-- @entity3 's @entity2 title defense suffered a big blow in rainy @entity5 in midweek , and the @entity8 club 's hopes of a fourth successive @entity10 crown were all but ended in similarly wet conditions on home turf on saturday			1
@entity13 moved seven points clear of their archrivals with just four games to play after clinching a tense 2 - 1 victory in the " @entity18 " clash -- @entity3 's first home defeat this season , ending a 54 - game run in all competitions at the @entity24			1
@entity25 came out on top in his battle with @entity28 as his 73rd - minute winner took his league tally this season to 42 -- one more than the @entity31			1
" we 've taken a gigantic step in @entity10 by defeating @entity3 , " @entity13 captain @entity32 told the club 's website			1
" there are still points in play and we must show respect for our opponents , but winning here is taking an important step in the championship			0
" we behaved like a true team			0
@entity25 did an excellent job , but all of us played well from start to finish			0
it was a very important match and we earned a difficult victory			0
" the match was ominously similar to wednesday 's 1 - 0 defeat by @entity51 , as @entity3 dominated possession despite slippery conditions -- but failed to capitalize against a @entity13 side who lost 2 - 1 to @entity56 in the first leg of their @entity2 semifinal			1
@entity18 key to title race ? while the @entity62 club caught @entity3 on the counterattack just before halftime , @entity13 exposed the @entity67 side 's defensive weaknesses as @entity69 midfielder @entity68 scrambled in a 17th - minute opener after the home team failed to clear @entity73 's inswinging corner			1
it was @entity13 's 108th goal in 34 league games this season -- a new record , beating @entity13 ' feat in the 1989 - 90 season			2
@entity3 coach @entity81 brought @entity82 off the bench with just over 20 minutes to go , and the @entity84 forward made an instant impact as he bundled in an equalizer at the second attempt			0
@entity82 replaced @entity89 midfielder @entity88 , who made a record 32nd @entity18 appearance			0
however , the home crowd 's relief was shortlived as @entity25 beat the offside trip to gather @entity95 's fine pass down the right , and the world 's most expensive player netted his 54th goal this season from an acute angle			2
@entity28 has scored 63 in all competitions , but has now not netted in the last three @entity18 matches -- and @entity3 have lost back to back for the first time since 2009			2
@entity13 's former @entity51 coach @entity105 celebrated his second @entity18 victory in 11 clashes , and first in the league , having won the @entity109 last year			1
the 49 - year - old has already won titles in @entity62 , @entity112 and his native @entity113 , and was under big pressure to end @entity3 's dominance this season			1
" i congratulate @entity13 for their victory and also for their league title which i have no doubt they have clinched tonight , " @entity81 told reporters , as he defended his decision to leave @entity119 and @entity120 on the bench			0
" i selected the team which i thought had the best chance to defeat @entity13			2
" @entity13 had held a 10 - point lead just over a month ago , but three draws allowed @entity3 -- who had won 11 games in a row -- to entertain hopes of closing the gap to just one this weekend			1
@entity81 's team still hold a 29 - point lead over third - placed @entity135 , who host @entity136 on sunday			0
in @entity112 's @entity140 , fourth - placed @entity139 's @entity2 hopes were dented by a 0 - 0 draw with mid-table @entity142 on saturday			2
the result left @entity139 two points behind third - placed @entity145 , who play on sunday along with leaders @entity147 and title - chasing deefnding champions @entity149			0
@entity151 moved up to fifth with a 2 - 0 win at home to second - bottom @entity154 .			0

@entity25 's winner in @entity18 puts @entity13 seven points clear
second - placed @entity3 suffer second successive defeat this week
both teams were beaten in midweek @entity2 semifinal first legs
defeat ends @entity3 's 54 - match *unbeaten* run at the @entity24
