@entity0 -- in a move that will further complicate international efforts to get @entity7 peace negotiations restarted , the @entity3 government tuesday approved the construction of 1,100 homes in a southern @entity0 neighborhood that was seized by @entity3 in 1967			1
the @entity3 interior ministry announced that a district planning committee had approved the construction of the housing and that the decision would be open for public objections for the next 60 days			2
the move brought quick condemnation from @entity19 who claim the land @entity3 occupied in @entity0 and the @entity21 after the 1967 war as part of a future @entity19 state			1
@entity19 officials said the action proved that the government of @entity3 prime minister @entity28 was not serious about making peace			1
" he said at the @entity32 he was giving his hand in peace , but actually , he is digging in the land to build more settlements , " said @entity19 negotiator @entity30			2
the @entity3 move also drew international criticism , with @entity39 foreign secretary @entity38 condemning it while @entity42 officials expressed disappointment			1
" settlement expansion is illegal under international law , corrodes trust and undermines the basic principle of land for peace , " @entity38 said in a statement			0
" we call on the government of @entity3 to revoke this decision			0
" @entity55 press secretary @entity54 said the @entity42 was disappointed by @entity3 's announcement , and secretary of state @entity57 called it " counterproductive to our efforts to resume direct negotiations between the parties			1
" last week , the @entity62 -- made up of the @entity42 , the @entity63 , the @entity32 and @entity64 -- called on @entity3 and the @entity19 to resume peace talks within a month and set the end of 2012 as the deadline for their completion			1
the quartet also called on both sides to " to refrain from provocative actions , " a veiled reference to @entity3 settlement building in land @entity3 occupied after 1967			0
@entity30 called @entity3 's move " a slap in the face of the quartet and the whole international community , which is saying ' stop settlements			2
' " in an interview with the daily @entity83 , @entity28 defended @entity3 's right to build in @entity0			2
" we plan in @entity0 , we build in @entity0			0
the same way @entity3 governments have been doing for years			0
" as for possible @entity42 government criticism of the move , @entity28 declared that the @entity42 " know this -- they have followed this a long time			2
there is really nothing new			0
" in the interview , @entity28 also said @entity3 would not initiate another settlement freeze to get talks started again			0
" we already gave at the office , " he said , referring to a 10 - month freeze enacted by his government last year			0
@entity102 president @entity101 is expected to convene a @entity104 leadership meeting thursday to discuss the quartet proposal for the resumption of talks , but @entity28 's comments and the announcement of @entity3 construction on land that @entity19 maintain should form part of their future state is bound to further widen the large gap between the two sides			1
@entity101 has said repeatedly that the @entity19 will not return to negotiations until @entity3 halted all settlement construction and accepted 1967 border lines as a basis for the return to talks			1
@entity3 , for its part , has maintained that negotiations should begin with no pre-conditions .			0
