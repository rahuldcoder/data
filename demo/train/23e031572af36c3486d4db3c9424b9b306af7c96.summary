a raid by @entity1 special operations forces killed @entity3 in @entity27 , @entity6 , on may 2			1
@entity28 , @entity1 attorney for the @entity29 , asked for the change , a request that judge @entity32 granted in a brief order			2
the action came after a thorough analysis confirmed that @entity3 did indeed die after @entity36 raided his compound , according to an affidavit from a top @entity1 government official that was included in the filing			1
the officials noted that facial recognition and photograph analysis confirmed the identity , along with dna testing of the body			1
" the possibility of a mistaken identification is approximately one in 11.8 quadrillion , " the official said			1

the original indictment , filed in secret june 8 , 1998 , accused @entity3 of murder and conspiracy to kill @entity1 , among other charges , after the cab bombings that year at the embassies in @entity21 and @entity23			1
