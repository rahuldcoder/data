for the second time since the @entity4 - led effort to counter @entity5 began , the chairman of the @entity1 , gen. @entity0 , said he would not rule out asking the president to send @entity4 ground troops into @entity8			1
" i 've never been limited in my ability to make a recommendation of any size or sort to the @entity15 , " @entity0 told the @entity9 on thursday , adding that he is always re-evaluating the situation in @entity8			1
@entity0 told the committee that he could envision scenarios in which a @entity4 ground contingent would be necessary in @entity8 , particularly if the coalition moves to retake @entity20 or the western border with @entity22			1
" i 'm not predicting at this point that i would recommend that those forces in @entity20 and along the border would need to be accompanied by @entity4 forces , " cautioned @entity0 , " but we 're certainly considering it			1
" rep. @entity28 , @entity29 , the committee 's chairman , expressed concern about president @entity33 's consistent refusal to consider sending @entity4 ground troops to the region			1
" i will not support sending our military into harm 's way with their arms tied behind their backs , " @entity28 said , adding he would block any congressional authorization that specifically barred sending ground forces			0
and while @entity0 said he would not rule out the need for @entity4 ground troops in the future , he added : " i just do n't foresee a circumstance when it would be in our interest to take this fight on ourselves with a large military contingent			1
" throughout the hearing , @entity0 and defense secretary @entity50 described a mission in @entity8 and @entity22 that will likely be long and fraught with setbacks			1
" as a coalition , and as a nation , we must prepare for a long and difficult struggle , " @entity54 said			0
echoing those sentiments , @entity0 advised @entity4 to " take a long view " of the conflict , even as the @entity4 and its allies have gained ground			1
but members from both parties expressed serious concerns over the administration 's strategy in @entity8 and @entity22			2
while @entity28 and others are calling for more @entity4 involvement in @entity8 and @entity22 , other members are expressing frustrations over the fact that the @entity4 is potentially becoming involved in another protracted foreign war			1
" it looks like we 're going down the same road that [ former defense secretary ] @entity79 told us we had to do , " said rep. @entity75 , a @entity76 congressman from @entity77 who was visibly irritated			0
@entity81 rep. @entity80 of @entity82 , a veteran of the last @entity8 war , expressed similar concerns			0
" i 'm wondering how we can be walking down the same path that we 've walked down over the last decade or more and hope for a different outcome , " she said			0
committee members also called on the administration to seek a new @entity90 , essentially getting @entity92 ' approval to continue @entity4 military actions in the region			2
president @entity33 initially said he did not require such authorization , but has since indicated he would work with @entity92 to secure approval			0
asked about it in the hearing , @entity54 said he did not yet know what specific authorizations the @entity99 would be requesting , but insisted the president would engage members of @entity92 on the issue			0
throughout the hearing , @entity54 and @entity0 reiterated that military action alone will not defeat @entity5 , and that a political solution will need to come together in @entity8 and @entity22			1
but the secretary of defense stopped short of saying the @entity4 would seek the removal of @entity22 president @entity110 , despite @entity112 's reporting on wednesday that the administration was considering a change in strategy on that front			2
" yes , it is a longer - term part of this to find a stable government and leaders in @entity22 to be able to bring some stability to that country " even as the @entity4 focuses on @entity5 in the immediate term , @entity54 said			0
the @entity33 administration has insisted that the operation to fight @entity5 would rely on building partner capacity on the ground , training and equipping moderate @entity22 rebels and supporting the @entity130 and @entity132 fighters			1
but for some committee members , this assurance brought further concerns about whether the @entity4 could rely on those partner groups to take on @entity5			2
the @entity4 has not begun to vet members of the moderate @entity22 opposition , some of whom are more preoccupied with toppling @entity110 than taking on @entity5			0
and the @entity130 , already @entity4 - trained once before at great cost , initially fled in large numbers as @entity5 advanced into northern @entity8			2
" men and women will not fight if they do not have confidence in their leaders , " @entity54 said of the earlier breakdown			0
but the secretary tried to assure committee members that the new @entity8 government , under prime minister @entity151 , would make the changes necessary to strengthen those forces , and both officials said the future of the conflict , on the whole , looks bright			2
still , @entity0 said the campaign to defeat @entity5 will inevitably follow a pattern of " three steps forward , two steps back			0
" " and at every step forward or back , " he added , " we 'll debate about the size of the step			0
