@entity0 -- the @entity3 is upgrading security clearances for 10,000 of its airport personnel , giving them access to " secret " intelligence to help them better detect threats and stop terrorists , the agency said friday			1
to date , the agency has granted access to secret - level classified information to 744 front - line supervisors , managers and behavior - detection officers			1
it now hopes to be able to give that clearance to all 10,000 supervisory personnel in the next two years , it said			0
the change does not involve airport screeners , the people responsible for inspecting people and luggage at airport checkpoints			1
" it 's a natural progression , " @entity3 spokeswoman @entity25 said			1
" it 's the next step in professionalizing our work force			0
what this will do is give them a leg up and a little more detail than what they 're getting in the [ current ] briefing			0
" the change will empower the employees and make sure they have up - to - date and accurate information about intelligence threats , she said			2
the majority of the agency 's headquarters managers already have secret - or higher - level clearances for classified information			2
@entity49 , a senior research fellow at the @entity50 , said it is a good idea to increase the number of aviation security officials with access to intelligence			1
the move could decrease the chance that information will be leaked because employees who are given clearance are trained to treat the information appropriately , he said			0
officers also must undergo additional background checks before receiving the upgraded status , the agency said			0
the @entity3 said personnel granted security clearances are educated about their responsibility to protect classified information , sign a non-disclosure agreement and take annual refresher training			1
under the federal government 's system of classifying information , " secret " clearance is above " restricted " and " confidential " but below " top secret			1
" @entity77 , director of the @entity78 , was enthusiastic about the expanded base of people with access to " secret " intelligence , saying it is particularly needed by behavior detection officers , who look for travelers exhibiting unusual behavior			1
" just think , if we had pulled that @entity91 bomber aside and spoken to him for just a few minutes , he would have never gotten on that plane , " @entity77 said			0
but support for the move is n't universal			0
" our members are screaming because the problem is , as it always has been , that [ airline pilots ] are being left behind , " said @entity96 , president of the @entity97			0
" i 'd much rather have the critical information get to the flight crews " and flight attendants , he said			0
@entity96 said airport security personnel " see passengers for several seconds , and yet they 're not sharing [ information ] with air crews who see them for several hours			1
" he also said the @entity3 has " a very high turnover rate " compared with that of flight crews , so sensitive information will migrate away from the government			2
@entity114 , security chairman for the @entity115 , agreed that flight crews should receive " secret " information , saying terrorists have proved that they can still get on aircraft			2
" you have to strengthen them all the way up to that last line of defense , " @entity114 said .			0

@entity3 says access to " secret " intelligence will help them better detect threats
@entity130 does not apply to airport security screeners
new clearances will be above " confidential " but below " top secret "
