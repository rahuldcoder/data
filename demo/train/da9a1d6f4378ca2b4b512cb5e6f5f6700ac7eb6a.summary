-- @entity1 powered her way to a first @entity4 final in seven years after she brushed aside @entity5 to set up a meeting with @entity7			1
the @entity8 claimed her first ever @entity10 title as a 17 - year - old back in 2004 and recovered from an early wobble against @entity13 wildcard @entity5 to triumph 6 - 4 6 - 3			1
standing in between @entity1 and the fourth major championship of her career will be @entity7 , from the @entity16 , after she beat @entity18 fourth seed @entity19 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 2			1
@entity1 told reporters after her match : " it 's amazing to be back in the final at @entity4 , it 's been a while			1
" i 'm really happy even though i did n't play my best tennis today			0
to be in the final is a great achievement for me but i still feel like i 've got more to do			0
" the final looked a long way off when the fifth seed slumped to 3 - 0 down in the opening set , after a series of untimely double faults handed @entity5 the advantage			1
but when the @entity13 squandered a chance to go into a 4 - 0 lead @entity1 burst into life and took six of the next seven games to secure the first set			2
she then raced into a 5 - 1 lead in the second before @entity5 secured a break of service to give her a lifeline , but it was quickly snuffed out as the @entity8 broke back immediately to secure her place in saturday 's showpiece final			1
@entity7 , who lost in the semifinal stage last year to @entity50 , is the first left - handed player to reach the final since compatriot @entity52 in 1990 , and the 18 - time major champion was watching on from the royal box			2
the eighth seed took a mere 27 minutes to secure the opening set , breaking her opponent 's serve twice and registering six aces on her way to a 6 - 1 success			1
but @entity19 -- the highest seed left in the final four -- recovered her composure and roared back into contention in the second set , securing two breaks to take it 6 - 3			1
that setback only inspired @entity7 to greater heights as she grabbed the initiative with a 3 - 1 lead in the decider and watched as @entity19 served a double fault to hand her victory			1
she told reporters : " i saw @entity52 ( @entity52 ) in the locker room and she wished me good luck			0
i 'm so happy but i do n't really believe i am in the final			0
this is the best day of my life			0
" " i started really well , all match it was about serve so i was happy mine went well in the third set			0
in the beginning it was close but after i broke her , i played well and she was a little bit down i think			0
" she played very well in the second set and it was tough after that but i tried to play it as if it was a normal game and not the @entity4 semifinal			2
" @entity19 acknowledged she was beaten by the better player and said @entity7 is well capable of securing an upset against the favorite @entity1			2
" i probably could have played better but when i had chances she really came up with the good stuff , " she said			0
" i think she can beat anybody any day , because right now she has a really good game			0
she 's really going for it			0
if she 's going to play like this , like she played today , i 'm sure she has all the chances to win the next match			2

@entity1 will play @entity7 in the *ladies* final at @entity4
@entity8 fifth seed @entity1 beats @entity13 @entity5 6 - 4 6 - 3
@entity16 eighth seed @entity7 triumphs 6 - 1 3 - 6 6 - 2 over @entity19
it is @entity1 's first @entity4 final since she won in 2004
