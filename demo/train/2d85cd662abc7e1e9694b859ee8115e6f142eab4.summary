-- the search for @entity2 , a 14 - year - old autistic boy who ran out of his school two weeks ago , focused friday on the @entity5 , a large railroad yard for passenger cars , in @entity7 , @entity8 , according to a source close to the investigation			1
the teenager is fascinated by trains , his family has said			2
the source also gave @entity0 new details about the widespread search for @entity16 , who was last seen on surveillance video running out of @entity18 in @entity7 on the afternoon of october 4			1
three hours after @entity20 went missing , bloodhounds traced his scent to a marshy area near his school , but then lost the trail near the water , the source said			1
one hour after that , the bloodhounds picked up @entity16 's scent again , this time at a subway station nearby , the source said			1
searches of train stations , tracks and tunnels are being conducted at the start of every shift by the @entity37 , @entity30 police commissioner @entity29 said , adding that 50 @entity39 officers and a task force of detectives are working the case			2
transportation officials in @entity30 suspended overnight track maintenance on the city 's transit system last weekend as workers combed the underground network			2
all 468 @entity30 subway stations have been searched , and aviation , harbor and canine officers are mobilized and deployed periodically , the @entity39 said			2
the previous notion that @entity20 did not like water may not be correct , according to the source , who said @entity16 apparently recently attended a class trip on a @entity59 cruise and was fascinated by the water			1
the @entity39 had six divers in nearby water on thursday using sonar , the source said			1
for the first time in the extensive search , police have brought in the assistance of cadaver dogs , the source said			1
the clothing company @entity69 also is now working with the @entity39 and a federal agency , providing them with a shirt matching the one @entity16 was wearing at the time of his disappearance			2
the source said officials will put that shirt into their database to scan video cameras for recognition , similar to facial recognition			1
the @entity80 brought in special cameras extended on poles to search the sewer system in and around the area @entity20 went missing , the source said			1
@entity39 is also working in conjunction with the food delivery company @entity86 to examine its trucks			2
the source said there is a truck depot nearby and @entity16 possibly could have gone into a truck without a driver knowing and left the area			1
@entity30 police patrol cars and search vehicles have been playing a recording of @entity16 's mother calling for him into the streets , @entity93 , director of operations for @entity94 , said thursday			2
" avonte , this is your mother			2
walk toward the lights , " the message repeats			2
the hope is the teen , who is unable to communicate verbally , will hear the sound of his mother 's voice and approach the emergency vehicles			0
the extended efforts of the @entity39 have led to increased awareness among @entity30 residents , with posters and fliers filling the streets , subway alerts and city papers all spreading the same message : have you seen @entity2 ? " i heard the day he first went missing on the news , " said @entity119 , a student at @entity120			1
" since then i 've seen posters at @entity124 and heard announcements there			0
" another @entity30 , @entity127 , said she has seen pleas to help @entity20 in newspapers and on the subway			1
" i was quite surprised by the individual announcement , " @entity131 said , noting that she could n't remember ever hearing a similar announcement for a missing child			1
" i think the @entity39 will eventually find him , " @entity119 said			0
" it 's just a matter of time because everyone in the city is aware of it			0
" @entity143 ( who wished to not be identified by her last name ) agreed with @entity119 but was unsure if the same intense search technique should be used in the future			0
" i wonder if it were more frequent we would become more immune to it , " @entity143 said , suggesting that @entity30 are aware of @entity20 because the search efforts have been so publicized			1
the reward for the safe return of @entity20 grew this week to $ 77,500 , as divers joined an ever growing number of police and rescue officers from several states who have been searching for him nonstop for more than a week			1
@entity16 's mother , @entity160 , told @entity0 's " @entity163 " on thursday that she believes her son is still alive and that someone is probably holding him			0
" my message to my son is that i love him and we 're going to find him			0
you 'll come home to your family			0
and for anyone who has him , please be kind and to let him go , " she said			0
@entity29 said he is not holding the school safety officer who was on duty when the teen ran out of the @entity8 high school responsible for the boy 's disappearance			0
when @entity20 approached the front door of his school the day he disappeared , the safety agent told him to go back upstairs , @entity29 said at a news conference on wednesday			1
surveillance video then showed @entity16 turning and going down another hallway , and exiting the building from a side door , he said			0
surveillance video provided by the police department shows that no supervisor or monitor stopped the 14 - year - old when he ran out			1
" even though he 's 14 , it should n't matter			1
no one should be , you know , allowed to run around the hallways in school			0
and that security guard should have questioned him , " @entity160 said			0
@entity199 , the @entity201 family 's attorney , said it took school officials at least 45 minutes to call police after @entity20 left			1
" i do n't understand how this happens to a special needs child unless there is something in there that failed the family , " he told " @entity163 " on thursday			0
the @entity30 @entity211 issued a statement saying it is working closely with police			0
the school is not commenting			0
the @entity201 family filed a " notice of claim " on october 9 , said @entity199 , marking the first step of a lawsuit against the city of @entity30			2
he declined to give further information about the claim			0
police said @entity16 was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt , black jeans and black sneakers			0
he is 5 feet , 3 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds			0
anyone with information about @entity20 is asked to contact the @entity39 's @entity228 at 800 - 577 - @entity229			1
the public can also submit tips at the @entity228 website , nypdcrimestoppers.com or can text to 274637 ( crimes ) , then enter @entity234			0
@entity0 's @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report			0
