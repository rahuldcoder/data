@entity0 , @entity1 -- what do the @entity4 space missions , laser eye surgery and sustainable cocoa have in common ? these are just some of the historic breakthroughs that @entity11 research labs across the world have helped become a reality over the years			1
but the prestigious tech firm had a glaring omission on their global map			0
@entity17 is now the fastest growing continent in the world , according a recent report from the @entity19			2
and yet @entity11 did n't have a single hub there -- until recently			2
last year , @entity11 opened its 12th research facility in @entity0 , @entity1 's capital , its first in the continent			1
spearheading this innovation center is @entity25 , a @entity26 scientist who has spent more than 20 years overseas working on software answers to real - world problems			1
armed with this international experience , the researcher has now returned to the continent to help create innovative solutions for @entity17 everyday challenges			2
" it 's easy to talk about giving back but when the opportunity presents itself -- such as @entity36 that allows you to create innovations in science and technology to begin to make a proper impact in the lives of more than a billion people -- i do n't know what more can stop anybody , " says @entity25			1
conquering the " new world " as a teenager @entity25 was interested in computer sciences			2
but his country 's lack of infrastructure prompted him to look abroad as a way of " intellectual escape			0
" the bright @entity26 managed to secure a scholarship at the @entity54 in @entity55 and with only a plane ticket and bus fare he set off for , what he called , " the new world			0
" after completing his education in @entity55 , @entity25 moved to the @entity62 where he began his career in software and services research			1
@entity25 went on to work in @entity11 's @entity66 -- an international program where he was responsible for the technical strategy at eight global facilities			1
today , having returned to the continent , he wants to leverage the strong growth of @entity17 's emerging markets and continue @entity11 's longstanding tradition in research breakthroughs			1
" as i build and design i have got to understand that the majority of my people live [ on ] under less than two dollars a day , " he says			0
" [ the ] majority of my people only speak one language -- so think about those things -- that whole holistic view allows technological innovation to be relevant to the community			0
that is what we 're calling @entity88 solutions			0
" " let 's come back " that approach is central to @entity25 's work			1
" all innovators in the continent of @entity17 should be problem centric , " he says			2
" what problems are we trying to solve and ask yourself , at the end , ' who is going to use it ? ' if you ask those two questions then we can begin to talk about sustainability			0
" in recent years the @entity1 government has actively encouraged @entity105 development in the country			2
christened the " @entity109 , " the $ 9.2 billion project known as @entity108 is an ambitious undertaking that could help @entity1 become a technology and innovation hotspot			0
the country 's technological boom has also been spurred by a rise in the number of innovation centers , where young coders and aspiring entrepreneurs join forces , network and work on their trailblazing ideas			0
similar hubs have also mushroomed across the continent in recent years -- from @entity26 to @entity126 and @entity127 to @entity128			0
but while there is a boom in tech spaces across @entity17 , many of the apps created there often fail to take off			1
@entity25 says tech entrepreneurs need to be cautious about starting businesses without any commercial foresight			1
" sustainability of innovation comes from commercial viability , " he says			0
" if you innovate for fun , then we would n't be where we are today and i think that is the kind of ecosystem we see right now			0
" after more than two decades abroad , @entity25 is committed to reverse the continent 's so - called " brain drain , " the exodus of brilliant minds relocating to countries outside @entity17			1
" i am part of the diaspora and i am home , " he says			0
" and i am saying ' let 's come back , there is just so much ' ; the winds of change [ are ] massive -- let 's come back and make a difference , " adds @entity25			2
" there is a tremendous potential for skill of impact when you innovate			1

@entity11 research has opened its 12th research facility in @entity1 's capital , @entity0
running first commercial tech lab in @entity17 is chief scientist @entity25
he calls the bright @entity17 scientists working in the diaspora to come home
" there is a tremendous potential for skill of impact when you innovate , " says @entity25
