@entity0 -- during president @entity4 's three - day swing through the states of @entity6 and @entity7 , he fielded questions at a town hall meeting in @entity10 and visited a high school in @entity12			2
two official events to promote his jobs plan			0
compare that to seven fundraisers he headlined , raising at least $ 8 million for his re-election campaign and the @entity19			1
who paid for the trip ? you did			0
taxpayers are footing the bill for almost the entire trip , which also cost millions of dollars			2
it 's standard practice for presidents , both @entity19 and @entity30 , to go on predominantly fundraising trips with taxpayer 's paying for most of the travel costs			1
do some official @entity36 business on the trip and -- voila ! -- the president 's re-election campaign and party shoulder very little of the cost			1
" usually , a political party only covers a fraction of the costs of presidential travel , usually in the single digit percentages , " says @entity42 with the @entity43 , a nonpartisan nonprofit group against wasteful government spending			1
" most of the money raised really comes at a free cost to the parties			2
they only reimburse for a few hundred thousand dollars , on a given trip , if tax payers are lucky			0
" the price tag on presidential travel is exorbitant			1
@entity58 costs $ 181,757 per flight hour to operate , according to the @entity58			0
there 's a c - 17 military support plane to fly the president 's limousines to his destination , perhaps another if @entity65 will be used during the trip			2
and the personnel : the salary costs of a @entity70 detail and dozens of @entity36 staffers who also required meals , transportation and hotel rooms			0
there are also local security costs like overtime pay for police officers who escort the presidential motorcade or provide security along the travel route			2
there is little transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel			1
a @entity36 spokesman declined to say how the @entity36 and the @entity19 divided the cost of @entity4 's western trip , citing security concerns			1
other administrations have declined to comment on the same grounds			0
a report conducted by the @entity19 - controlled @entity93 while president @entity94 was in the @entity36 concluded taxpayers paid for about 97 % of presidential travel , the @entity30 just 3 %			1
@entity42 says there 's no reason to believe the breakdown is much different with the @entity4 administration or other @entity101			0
" ever since @entity103 's administration , presidential travel has carried with it a lot of controversy over cost as well as politics , " @entity42 says			1
" even @entity108 was cited for having traveled a great deal abroad , when he was having domestic political troubles			0
" in 1995 , president @entity111 attended eight fundraisers in four days on a cross-country swing			0
taxpayers often pay for travel to campaign events that rally support rather than raise money , like @entity94 's dramatic entrance into a baseball stadium in @entity122 @entity121 less than a month before his re-election in 2004			1
call it a perk of the presidency , something a mere candidate does not enjoy			0
" and that 's the point when the parties themselves have to pay for the cost of the pomp and the circumstance , " @entity42 says			2
" the pomp and the circumstance gets a lot smaller , a lot more modest			0

it 's standard practice for presidents , both @entity19 and @entity30
there is little transparency in determining the cost of presidential travel
taxpayers also pay for travel to campaign events that rally support rather than raise money
