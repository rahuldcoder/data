@entity0 -- a @entity0 lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court , claiming he is the father of basketball star @entity5			1
@entity6 alleges that the athlete and his family have been involved in a cover - up to deny paternity by committing fraud and misrepresentation			1
he told @entity17 's " @entity16 " on thursday that he wants " a carefully structured and secure dna test " to prove he 's the @entity15 all - star 's father			1
@entity18 says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity and is seeking $ 4 million in damages			1
an earlier test ruled out the possibility , but he said the test could have been tampered with -- " and there are indications that there was a motivation			0
" @entity18 said he had sex with @entity5 ' mother , @entity29 , after meeting at a @entity0 bar while she was visiting from @entity31 in 1984			1
a few months later , she told him she was pregnant , but did not say whether he was the father			0
@entity18 said his only request was that the child , if a boy , play basketball			1
he said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later , " after being asked whether i had a son , and i then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility			0
" " i came across this set of recollections and in focusing on them , they amplified , " he said			0
in the complaint , filed june 23 , @entity18 says , " i recently have concluded that a comprehensive , sophisticated and well - funded effort might well have been underway for quite some time , perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant @entity5 was in high school , to frustrate identification of his real father , and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me			1
" he stopped short of saying he is certain he is @entity5 ' father			1
" i do n't want to make such a definitive statement in the absence of corroborative evidence " such as @entity59 , he said			0
@entity18 said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire			2
" i have some limitation considerations that caused me to want to file the suit before the end of june , " he said			0
he denied the timing had anything to do with the current @entity5 mania			2
@entity5 is scheduled to announce thursday evening the team he has chosen to play for next season , a deal worth perhaps tens of millions of dollars or more			1
he currently plays for the @entity72			0
he says he was informed by @entity29 months later that she was pregnant			0
he claims she told him the child would be named @entity5 , similar to @entity74 , @entity18 's first and middle names			1
the lawsuit states @entity29 was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter , but @entity18 said she told him she was in her early 20s			1
@entity18 is a solo legal practitioner in the @entity0 , and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf			2
a call to @entity5 ' attorney , @entity81 of @entity72 , @entity31 , was not immediately returned			2
