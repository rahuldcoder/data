-- the highly - fancied @entity2 team and co-hosts @entity4 crashed out of @entity5 on saturday as the @entity6 and @entity7 became the first nations to secure quarterfinal berths			1
@entity2 led @entity10 going into the third and final round of matches , needing just a draw against @entity7 to progress into the last eight			1
however , a superb strike from veteran @entity7 captain @entity17 just before halftime proved enough to send @entity21 's side home			1
" when we left @entity7 , we all said , ' we will give everything when our compatriots are n't having the best of times , ' said @entity17 , referring to @entity7 's economic problems			1
" i believe that this tonight puts a smile on their faces			0
we 're happy we managed to do this for @entity7 , for our country , for @entity33 all over the world			2
" @entity5 : day 9 as it happened the @entity36 had a better goal difference than the @entity33 , who won the tournament in a huge shock in 2004 , but went out on head - to - head record			1
@entity4 needed to win to go through , but a 72nd - minute strike from @entity42 sent the @entity44 top of the table and facing a quarterfinal against the runner - up from @entity48 -- which will be decided on sunday			1
@entity7 1 - 0 @entity2 @entity17 experienced the high of sending his country through to the knockout stage of a major tournament for the first time in eight years , but the 35 - year - old may not get the chance to break his country 's appearance record at @entity5			1
the midfielder will miss the quarterfinal after receiving his second yellow card of the group stages , having been controversially booked for diving when it appeared that he had been fouled in the penalty area in the second half			0
with @entity7 leading 1 - 0 , a second goal would have killed off @entity2 's hopes -- but instead a furious @entity17 missed a nailbiting climax to the match after demanding to be substituted before he was sent off for further remonstrating with @entity71 referee @entity70			1
@entity17 , who matched 2004 captain @entity72 ' mark of 120 caps for @entity7 , repeated his act of scoring at the @entity76 , having done so in the opening match against @entity78 eight years ago			1
he surged through the @entity36 defense after @entity80 failed to deal with a throw - in and fired a low shot past goalkeeper @entity83 in time added on at the end of the first half			0
@entity87 almost made it 2 - 0 with 20 minutes to play , but his curling left - foot free kick bounced to safety off the post			0
after that it was all @entity2 , but @entity93 was twice denied by goalkeeper @entity94			2
it marked a disappointing end to the two - year reign of @entity21 , who will now return to his homeland with a post at @entity102 club @entity101			0
" the other team just defended			0
with all due respect , it was hard to play against them			0
but it 's not that we did n't play well , " @entity21 said			2
" we were undefeated for 16 games but we did n't win today			0
" @entity6 1 - 0 @entity4 @entity4 had high hopes of making the most of home advantage in @entity115 , but could not beat a @entity6 team that bounced back from their opening 4 - 1 crushing by @entity2 to top the group with six points			1
@entity42 followed up his opening goal from the 2 - 1 win over @entity4 with another vital strike			1
the 26 - year - old midfielder , who plays for @entity127 club @entity126 , cut inside to beat goalkeeper @entity128 after being fed by veteran striker @entity129 on the counter attack following good work by @entity132			0
@entity4 poured forward in search of an equalizer , which by itself would not have been enough , but @entity135 cleared a late effort off the line			2
" we started badly and let the occasion get to us a little bit , the home side capitalized on our mistakes , " @entity6 goalkeeper @entity138 said			2
" but with time we got better , we created chances and then scored a deserved goal			0
" the @entity44 will next go to @entity146 on june 21 , where their opponents will likely be @entity78 , @entity150 or @entity151			0
the @entity33 are likely to face unbeaten @entity152 in @entity153			0
@entity4 coach @entity154 is now expected to be replaced , as his contract has ended			2
" we know we had the chance to win but they ( the @entity6 ) played excellent football and they scored a goal , " he told reporters			1
" we had several opportunities in the first half but we did n't take our chances			0
