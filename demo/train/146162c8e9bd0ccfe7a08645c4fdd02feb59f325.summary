and it has plans to hit the world land speed record at 1,000 mph			1
made of titanium , carbon fiber and , like superman , is designed to go faster than a speeding bullet , the @entity9 has been painstakingly put together and tested over the better part of six years			0
in 2016 , the @entity18 - based team plan to take the 42 - foot ( 8.9m ) vehicle to @entity20 , a dry lake bed in @entity22 , for a crack at the record breaking attempt			1
former fighter jet pilot @entity26 ( @entity26 ) wing commander @entity28 said even designing a car that can hold together at these blistering speeds has been a triumph of the engineer 's art. " no rubber , " he told @entity0 from @entity36 headquarters in @entity37 , @entity18			2
" beyond about 450mph it 's really , really hard to keep a tire on - they just get flung off			2
so we have solid aluminum			0
" we 've been through a huge evolution of finding something that 's tough enough that would do the job			0
basically this car goes faster than a speeding bullet , so anything that hits this is like being shot at from a gun			2
" the former jet ace , who has flown combat missions over @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , can lay claim to be the only man to have broken the sound barrier in the air and on land			1
in 1997 , he hit 763 mph or @entity61 in the vehicle @entity62 to become the first man to break the sound barrier on land			1
the @entity36 takes the land speed record a step further in a car that is part jet fighter , part @entity74 racer and part space rocket			1
" a thousand miles an hour at ground level is faster than any jet fighter has ever traveled in history , so there are going to be some major challenges , " @entity28 said			2
besides three engines delivering 135,000 horsepower , the @entity9 is equipped with rocket boosters to deliver the thrust necessary to get it to 1,000 mph			1
" ( the jet engines ) on their own will take us to 600mph or thereabouts , but to get a land speed record , at about 350 miles an hour we turn on a rocket engine to take us all the way through to a 1000mph , " said lead designer @entity83			1
" the rocket is the key -- that 's the difference between 750 mph and 1,000 mph			1
" the bloodhound team scoured the globe to find a desert run that could accommodate a vehicle which , at 1,000 mph , is likely to run out of road in a matter of seconds			1
the requirements were a perfectly flat landscape , at least 12 miles long and two miles wide			0
they eventually selected @entity20 , in @entity104 , @entity22 where @entity9 will cover a mile in 3.6 seconds -- equivalent to 4.5 football pitches laid end to end every second			1
having already set the land speed record , @entity28 is in a good place to describe what it is like in the cockpit of the world 's fastest cars			1
even so , the new challenges presented by @entity9 sometimes leave him lost for words			0
" the best single description i 've ever heard was from the late , great @entity119 who set three world records in the 1960s and got up to almost 600 mph			2
" somebody asked him one day what it was like and he said : ' what is it like to drive a land - speed ( record ) ? to drive a jet car to do 600 miles an hour over the ground ? " and he said : ' it 's a bit like the taste of chocolate			1
if you 've never had a bar of chocolate i am really going to struggle to explain what it is like '			0
" ultimately , he said , the cockpit is place of tremendous @entity143 forces , heat and vibration			0
" in a land - speed car , that 's just a normal day in the office			2
uncomfortable , but that 's what it 's like			0
it 's hugely busy , it 's very hot , it 's very noisy			0
apart from all those things , it should be fairly simple			0
" while the aim of the project is to crack the magic 1,000 mph mark ( the closest yet has been an @entity156 jet fighter which flew just above ground level at 988mph ) , @entity28 said the ultimately the record attempt is about instilling a sense of engineering progress in future generations			1
" this about developing technology			0
this is about finding out new things			0
this is about exploring , " he said			0
" and the story of engineering exploration is about the failures and the challenges , not just about the successes			0

the jet - *propelled* @entity8 aims to be the first car to hit 1,000 mph
rocket boosters , engineers say , will push car through the sound barrier to world record
the team plans to try in 2016 at @entity20 , in @entity104 , @entity22
driver @entity28 already holds the world land speed record of 763 mph , set in 1997
