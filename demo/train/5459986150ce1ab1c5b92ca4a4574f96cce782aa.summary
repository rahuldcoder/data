@entity0 -- a juror wept friday as @entity4 's former partner told a tragic tale of a slip of the lip and the ensuing result -- the strangling death of a 26 - year - old woman , who was killed because she 'd heard too much			1
what made this recitation of deadly details different from the ones that preceded it during reputed mob boss @entity4 's trial in federal court was that the victim had been the girlfriend of the witness			1
" it 's affected me and it 's going to affect me until the day i die , " @entity21 said in the first humanizing testimony the jury had heard in two days of recollections about multiple murders and extortions			1
@entity21 was @entity4 's number - two front man for nearly two decades , when prosecutors say @entity4 reigned terror over @entity0			1
@entity4 is charged with 19 killings in a 32 - count indictment that includes extortion , money laundering , and racketeering in addition to the deaths			2
" he strangled her all the way down to the basement ... when he got to the basement she was dead , " @entity21 told the jury , referring to @entity4 and @entity21 's girlfriend , @entity39			1
a female juror covered her mouth and began shaking , wiping away tears while she repeatedly checked the time , as if longing for the testimony to end			0
shot - by - shot testimony in @entity4 trial makes jurors squirm prosecutors brought up the horrific murder of @entity56 in 1981 just 10 minutes before court ended friday			1
in his testimony , @entity21 said his much younger girlfriend became very upset when he left her birthday party abruptly to meet with @entity4			1
@entity21 said he " inadvertently blurted out " to @entity56 that he and @entity4 were @entity62 informants			1
" i bit my tongue and said we have a connection to @entity67 in the @entity62 and i got to leave , " @entity21 said , referring to his and @entity4 's rogue @entity62 informant - handler			1
@entity67 is serving a 40 year sentence in @entity69 on murder charges connected to information he leaked to @entity4			2
@entity4 then said several times that " he wanted to kill her " because of what @entity56 then knew about the duo 's relationship with @entity67 , @entity21 testified			1
" i said no , of course not , " @entity21 continued			2
" and he ( @entity4 ) explained a whole litany of reasons why @entity67 helped us ... all of us and ( said ) ' you are jeopardizing that			2
' " @entity21 , who testified earlier that @entity67 had tipped them off to indictments , wire taps , and investigations , said it took him a while to come around but he eventually agreed to the slaying of @entity56			1
" i could n't do it ... ( @entity4 ) knew it ... he said , ' i 'll take care of it , i 'll do it , ' " @entity21 told the jurors as they listened intently			1
@entity21 invited @entity56 to a house he had just bought for his parents , and when they walked in the front door , " he ( @entity4 ) grabbed her by the throat and strangled her , " @entity21 said			1
prosecting attornery @entity103 asked : " what did you do ? " @entity21 : " nothing			2
" @entity103 : " why not ? " @entity21 : " that was the plan			2
" at that moment in court , @entity4 -- whose attorneys made it very clear in opening statements that he does not want the death of women on his hands -- stared at his former partner for the first time all day			2
it was only for a few seconds before he turned his head back downward			0
the two , who sparred with expletives at the end of court thursday , virtually ignored each other friday except for that one interlude			0
" i wrapped her up and he ( @entity4 ) went back upstairs " @entity21 went on			1
@entity21 testified that he " cleaned up " and they proceeded to take @entity56 ' body to an area near the @entity131 river where they buried her in a shallow grave			1
the remains of @entity39 were excavated from a tidal marsh in late 2000			2
most of her remains were discovered in plastic bags along with rope around the bags , a @entity138 state forensic anthropologist testified last week			0
almost all of @entity56 ' bones were recovered , according to dr. @entity146			2
because her body was in bags , even some of her hair was preserved			0
the hair , along with pieces of bones , were tested for dna and were positively identified as the remains of @entity56 , according to @entity146			0
@entity4 trial opens window on mob world of cold violence , fierce loyalty @entity56 ' brother , @entity56 , has been a regular at trial since it began in june			1

it brings tears to my eyes but i learned how to deal and fight it , because i need to learn more about it , ' cause you do n't know all it yet			0
" @entity21 pleaded guilty to 10 murders after charges were brought in 2004 and was spared the death penalty after agreeing to testify against @entity4			1
of his relationship with @entity56 , he told the jury : " i loved her , but i was n't in love with her			1
" after court , the attorneys discussed the defense 's amended witness list which had been reduced to 30 on tuesday , from originally over 80 witnesses			0
prosecuting attorney @entity188 argued that at least 15 of the witnesses -- former @entity62 agents -- would be a " waste " of the jury 's time , as they are being called to refute the notion that @entity4 was an informant , something @entity4 has strongly denied			1
@entity188 called these witnesses " irrelevant			0
" defense attorney @entity196 responded : " our witnesses are now down to 30			0
they are relevant to our case and we intend to call them			0
" the defense had mentioned on tuesday that it would shrink its list if alleged extortion victim @entity203 did n't testify because several defense witnesses were intended to challenge @entity203 ' expected testimony			0
