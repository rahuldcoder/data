-- have you heard the news ? because @entity5 ice sheets are melting , the sea level is likely to rise " unstoppably " by at least 10 feet , dooming many coastal towns and displacing millions of people			1
and it 's all going to happenâ € ” within several centuries			1
this is news you can snooze			1
so go ahead and hit that snooze button			1
could we plan for what will happen centuries from now if we wanted to ? should we plan for what will happen ? will there even be people centuries from now ? if there are , do we owe them anything ? the next 200 , 500 years , are not for us to worry about			2
the future is n't what it once was , but their business is n't our business			1
unimaginable technology has always come to the rescue and always will			2
like , we will invent giant , cost - effective floats for @entity33 and all the other cities and towns on the world 's coasts , or something			1
the announcements about the collapsing ice sheets came from two teams of scientists with different approaches , focused on different parts of the @entity5			1
" a large sector of the @entity5 ice sheet has gone into irreversible retreat , " according to @entity48 , a glaciologist at the @entity49 , who led one of the teams			1
" it has passed the point of no return			2
" his team measured shrinkages of 10 to 35 kilometers in several retreating glaciers since the early 1990s			2
those glaciers are also thinning			2
warming air is intensifying the winds that sweep round the @entity5 , but it 's not warming air that is melting the glaciers there			1
those winds are drawing warm waters to the surface			2
the warm waters are eroding the ice			1
causes ? seems to be mainly the warming caused by the greenhouse effects of increasing carbon dioxide from burning gas , oil , and coal			0
but the ozone hole , also human - caused but having nothing to do with greenhouse gases or fossil fuels , might also be intensifying the winds			0
so far , sea level rise worldwide has been caused mainly by the heat - caused expansion of seawater , much more than melting ice			1
but melting land ice will have a big effect on sea level rise			1
@entity87 , leader of the other research team , said that nothing can stop the collapse of the ice sheet , adding , " there 's no stabilization mechanism			1
" but , again , it will be slow			0
@entity95 of the @entity96 was first to predict this way back in 1978			0
he died without seeing the @entity5 glaciers break up			1
and so will we all			0
so , back to bed			0
people 200 years from now ? not our problemo			0
the only wrinkle in that thought is that centuries ago , about 225 years ago to be more precise , some people wrote a @entity106 and @entity107 that affect our lives every day and that we refer to daily to guide us legally and morally			0
those people could have said , " screw it , let 's make money			1
" i think about my debt to them for wanting to be better than that			0
i often wish we wanted to be as good			0
closer to home , closer to now , the @entity119 predicts that in this century , sea levels could rise as much as 3 feet			1
and that is our problem			0
some of us will be alive then			0
many of us will have children who will live to this century 's finish line			1
between then and now , there will likely be more devastating @entity128 - like hurricanes as winds intensified by warmer waters devastate shores			0
while reading about the @entity5 ice melt , i noticed three side articles , and clicked			1
one talked about flooding - related displacement already affecting people in low - lying areas around the world , from the natives of @entity140 to the people of @entity142			0
another speaks of misery caused in @entity145 by rising seas , where 18 million people will be displaced in the next 40 years by rising seawater or having their well - water and farms ruined by salt			0
the third article talked about our dysfunctional @entity154 's new defeat of yet another energy bill			1
@entity157 says , " a bill with strong bipartisan support to make the @entity160 more energy efficient has been blocked in the @entity162			0
" efficiency is bad ; we need wastefulness			0
either we have a moral responsibility to others or we do n't			1
it does n't matter whether they live around the block or in the next state or in the future			1
morally there 's not much difference between a person flooded out by @entity128 and a person flooded out 200 years from now by our collective , willful inaction			1
but some days , i 'm not even sure how willful it is			0
when i was in high school in the 1970s , i learned that we were too dependent on other countries for energy , and that oil and coal are non-renewable and polluting , and that we needed to begin a shift to harnessing clean renewable energy sources			0
the shift to petroleum - based economy had taken a century			0
the shift to clean renewables would be my generation 's most important task			1
a lot has happened but , bottom line , there 's been very little progress			2
technology advanced , but it has n't been embraced			2
it 's been outmaneuvered by denial and inertia backed by entrenched big - energy lobbying and campaign money			2
globally , we 're not exactly coming together to stabilize climate and institutionalize clean energy			0
i think we could do what 's needed			2
but collectively we simply are n't			2
sometimes i do n't see humanity as being capable of fixing the problems we 're creating			2
we 'd have to agree to fix them			0
before that , we 'd have to care			0
we 're not doing enough of any of those things			0
too often , we 're in denial			0
our main solution is that snooze button			1
so , let 's not worry about the people of @entity145 , @entity140 , @entity33 and @entity222 , or the 23rd century			2

scientists say @entity5 's ice land melting ' appears unstoppable '
@entity228 : who cares if sea level rises and wipes out coastal cities ?
he says either we have a moral responsibility to others or we do n't
@entity228 : but given our track record , we might as well hit the snooze button
