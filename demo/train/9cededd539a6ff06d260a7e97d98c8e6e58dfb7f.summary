-- doctors say the discovery of a 4 - year - old carrier of the @entity5 bird flu virus who shows no symptoms of the potentially lethal virus is a worrying development that could make the spread of the infection more difficult to monitor			2
the @entity12 said the boy was detected from a group of close contacts of the first infection in @entity17 and the laboratory results showed the boy was an asymptomatic carrier of the disease			1
the boy emerged after authorities screened 24 poultry owners in @entity25 , @entity26 in @entity27 , taking throat swabs of those in contact with the group			1
the report said the boy 's parents were engaged in poultry and fish trading			1
according to dr. @entity39 - man , associate professor , @entity40 at the @entity41 , while there is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from human to human , medical authorities need to be on the alert			1
" it really depends on whether this @entity5 virus is transmissible between humans ... that key question needs to be answered , " dr. @entity48 told @entity0			0
" so far , we do not know the full spectrum of the clinical presentations of these @entity5 patients			0
" in the beginning , we were only able to detect it because there were some severe cases and some people actually died			2
they are trying enhance the surveillance so that 's we can detect those cases where there is only a mild infection			2
" @entity5 is normally found in birds			0
until last month , it was never known to infect people			0
@entity69 has invited a team of international experts to assess the spread of the @entity5 bird flu virus in the country , the @entity68 said tuesday			0

@entity48 said evidence of human - to - human transmission would put the @entity5 problem into a different category			1
" if it can ( transmit human to human ) , then it 's a very different scenario -- we would not be able to detect asymptomatic carriers and that would be a huge problem , " he said			2
the discovery of the carrier has meant @entity17 has notched up a gear in its monitoring efforts , extending its action from a passive ' syndrome surveillance ' to a more active ' pathogen monitoring '			1
this involves actively seeking out and targeting populations at risk from the disease			0
