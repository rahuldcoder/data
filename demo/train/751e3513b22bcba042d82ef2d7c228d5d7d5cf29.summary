-- all that texting and social networking by teenagers could come back to byte them			2
a new study by the @entity5 links poor health behaviors -- including smoking , drinking and sexual activity -- to hypertexting and hypernetworking			1
the study defines hypertexting as sending more than 120 messages per school day			1
@entity15 is spending more than three hours per school day on social network sites like @entity18 , it said			1
" the startling results of this study suggest that when left unchecked texting and other widely popular methods of staying connected can have dangerous health effects on teenagers , " said @entity19 , lead researcher on the study			1
" this should be a wake - up call for parents to not only help their children stay safe by not texting and driving , but by discouraging excessive use of the cell phone or social websites in general			2
" teenagers are " spending really an excessive amount of time online , " he added later during a @entity0 interview			2
by doing so , they are contributing to " high - tech peer pressure			0
" @entity37 was reported by nearly 20 percent of the @entity39 teens surveyed , according to the study			1
according to the study , teens who are hypertexters are : -- two times more likely to have tried alcohol -- nearly 3.5 times more likely to have had sex -- 40 percent more likely to have tried cigarettes -- 41 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs -- 43 percent more likely to be binge drinkers -- 55 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight -- 90 percent more likely to report four or more sexual partners @entity52 was less pervasive , at 11.5 percent , but still associated with a similar list of maladies , the study found			1
according to the research , these teens are : -- 60 percent more likely to report four or more sexual partners -- 62 percent more likely to have tried cigarettes -- 69 percent more likely to be binge drinkers -- 69 percent more likely to have had sex -- 79 percent more likely to have tried alcohol -- 84 percent more likely to have used illicit drugs -- 94 percent more likely to have been in a physical fight @entity19 noted that minorities , children of parents with less education , and teenagers from homes without a father are more likely to engage in hypertexting and hypernetworking			1
he also cautioned , however , that the study " does not demonstrate cause and effect			1
" " we are not saying texting causes these behaviors , " he stressed			0
" we can recognize that these kinds of connections ... may be facilitating or enabling these kinds of behaviors , but we certainly ca n't think of ( the online connections ) as causing them			0
" nevertheless , researchers say the results of the study are so striking that they are giving rise to a new health risk category for the age group			1
the study is not the first time texting and social networking have come under fire			1
the activities have been blamed for accidents and promoting bad grammar skills			0
in january , federal safety regulators proposed a set of guidelines for states to create laws that would ban text messaging while driving			0
under the proposed guidelines , drivers caught typing on a handheld device while behind the wheel would face a minimum fine of $ 75 and unspecified action against their driving privileges			0
in cases resulting in serious injury or death , a driving while texting offense could be considered a felony			2
a ban on texting behind the wheel has already been enacted in 19 states and the @entity117			0
seven states have banned the use of all handheld devices while driving			0
and educators have long decried electronic forms of communication for gutting written language skills in students , starting with e-mails , expanding to instant messaging and continuing with text messaging and social networking			0
but it should be noted that teachers also complained about poor grammar before the internet came to be			0
@entity0 's @entity134 contributed to this report			2
