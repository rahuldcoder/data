@entity0 , whose work began popping up on @entity8 walls this month , posted a video on his website showing an elderly man -- not the artist -- working at a stall at the park on sunday			1
the selling price for each piece : $ 60			1
the man sat , as people passed by the paintings with barely a glance			1
@entity0 sets @entity8 on race to find street art before vandals according to the video , more than four hours passed before the first sale was made , to a customer who bargained to get two paintings for $ 60			1

he bought four more , @entity0 's video says			1
the total take for eight paintings : $ 420			2
the artist says he 's on a " residency on the streets of @entity8			1
" his website shows photos of a truck he parked in various places around @entity8 after painting the interior with a garden scene			2
paintings on @entity8 walls include one of a dog urinating on a fire hydrant , with a cartoon bubble that says , " you complete me			2
" @entity0 never shows his face			1

devoted fans race to find his latest work in @entity1 , and the phenomenon moved to @entity8 this month			2
late - night tv host @entity70 went so far as to broadly hint that he 'd like for a @entity0 work to show up on his studio wall			1
but do n't look for him in @entity7			1
his website said , " please note : this was a one off			0
the stall will not be there again today			2

" but there 's no proof of it			0
nobody 's gon na call it out			0
no one wants to acknowledge that that could be , " she said			0
" as long as he 's anonymous he 's going to keep making these incredible pieces for the rest of the month , " she said			0
