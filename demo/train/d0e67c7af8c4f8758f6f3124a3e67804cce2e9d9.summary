@entity0 , @entity1 -- a group of international cyclists gathered around in the restaurant of @entity0 's old @entity6 and listened attentively to an orientation by the tour 's chief coordinator			1
he listed what they would need to pack for the daily ride , which included water , snacks , energy bars , patch kits , pumps , cash , cell phones and cameras			2
" and you 'll need butt cream , " @entity22 , 36 , added jokingly , referring to small containers of protective balm designed for cyclists			2
considering the average 12 hours daily ride and the 12,000 - kilometer length of the tour , he was right			1
last week a group of cyclists took to the road on the @entity34 expedition starting from @entity0 , @entity1 , where the @entity35 and the @entity36 meet			1
the four - month road trip will take them through nine countries until they reach @entity41 , @entity42 , on the continent 's southern-most tip. the idea for the expedition came to a former development worker , @entity46 , who had worked in places like @entity48 and @entity1			1
@entity49 wanted to find a way to provide cheap , sustainable transportation solutions to local populations on the continent , and attract attention by organizing a continental bike race			1
" i wanted to start producing bikes for @entity42 that would help kickstart development -- sort of like @entity59 and @entity60 with their bikes , " he said			1
the bike production project did not take off , but the idea of a @entity69 to @entity41 bike race did , and in 2003 , the first @entity34 race took place , setting a @entity66 for the fastest human - powered crossing of @entity42			1
it is run by a @entity73 - based company of the same name , which now sponsors seven global treks , with @entity34 representing its flagship race			1
" this one tends to be the biggest draw , " said @entity22			2
" there is a mystery and magic to it			2
" for the past 11 years , the @entity34 expedition began from @entity69			1
this year , however , matters were different , because of current events			2
" there 's an international travel advisory against traveling to @entity87 right now , " explained @entity22			2
ironically , perhaps , the tour started this year from @entity0			1
it may be better known for its involvement in conflict in regions like @entity93 , but @entity22 described the north of @entity1 as " one of the safest places in the world			2
" " people here are really nice and hospitable , " he added			2
the change in plans made organizers add new routes and destinations to this year 's tour to maintain the tour 's length , including routes passing by the pyramids of @entity110 in @entity1 and the rock churches of @entity112 , in @entity48 , a favorite for many			1
" @entity48 is a classic , " said @entity114 , 29 , a seasoned tour guide			2
" the history and the culture are amazing			0
" in addition to ancient sites in @entity1 and @entity48 , the tour 's highlights include crossing the equator in @entity124 , passing @entity125 and the @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , the dunes of the @entity132 desert and on to @entity133 in @entity41			1
but the trek , of course , is no easy ride			0
there are tremendous obstacles to overcome , including navigational challenges , mechanical problems with the bikes , harsh weather conditions , difficult terrain , possible water shortages , the risk of diseases like malaria , and even predatory animals			2
and then there 's the challenge of having strangers get along for four months			0
" it 's a social experiment , " said @entity152 , giggling			0
but the greatest challenge , @entity22 maintains , is a universal one			0
" the biggest hazard for cyclists is the same everywhere in the world : the automobile , " insists @entity22			0
cyclists of all walks of life , ages and nationalities have joined the tour in the past			0
this year , they come from 13 different countries , with the youngest being 20 and the oldest 73			1
@entity168 , 22 , just graduated from college , and wanted " time off and to take an adventure			0
" on his first tour , @entity168 , whose father is @entity172 and mother is @entity42 , sees the tour as an opportunity to reconnect with the continent			1
" i 've always loved @entity42 , " he said			1
@entity168 is looking forward to some of the tour 's challenges , including the sandstorms of northern @entity1			0
" i would like to experience a haboob , " he said with a smile			0
the tour often brings back alumni and most notable of them is @entity186			0
@entity187 , 73 , a retired real estate agent and a mother of five from @entity189 , joined the first @entity69 to @entity41 tour in 2003			1
it was personal tragedy that brought her to @entity42			1
" my 18 year old daughter was killed in an accident in 2001 , " she said			2
" she had a burning desire to go to @entity42			1
" in 2002 , @entity187 saw an advertisement for @entity34			1
" i said to myself , i want to do this			0
" and there was a category for the leisurely fit , " she added with a laugh			0
@entity187 acknowledged that many thought she would not make it to the end			0
" there was even a bet that i would be the first to go , " she said			0
but she completed the tour , and is now back on her fourth tour , 11 years later			0
while the tour may provide an opportunity for some to take an adventure in @entity42 , the group 's founders are keen on giving back to local communities by donating bikes to individuals or organizations in the continent , supporting projects that promote bicycle awareness and raising funds for cyclists ' favorite charities			1
the @entity227 , the company 's development arm , has teamed up with many @entity42 groups , such as the @entity42 - based @entity231 , to distribute donated bicycles to students and health workers in several countries			1
in @entity243 , for example , @entity236 , a 19 - year - old female student used to walk four miles a day to school and arrive tired , which impacted her concentration in class , and even sometimes missed school			1
" but when i received the bike , all of this was over , " she said			0
" both of my performance and attendance improved			0
" @entity250 , 60 , is a health caregiver in @entity243			0
" i have been able to visit 10 to 15 patients on a daily basis , more than i used to when i had no bike , " he said			0
but perhaps most importantly , the tour has provided its participants with a deeper insight into @entity42			2
" i learned that there is such commonality among humanity regardless of color , " said @entity187			0
" the tour is not life changing , it is life affirming , " she added			0
" it teaches you what your strengths and weakness are			0

the @entity34 is a four - month , 12,000 km cycle race across the length of @entity42
race starts in @entity0 , passes @entity125 and the @entity126 , ends in @entity41
oldest *competitor* is a 73 - year - old @entity189 woman
