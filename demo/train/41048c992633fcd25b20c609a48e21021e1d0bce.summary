-- in august 1974 , editors of the @entity2 contacted the doctor who had developed a new method to save someone from choking -- then a major cause of death in the @entity8			2
his new technique was saving lives across the country , and they wanted to tell him they were publishing a story about it , and were going to name the procedure after him			0
dr. @entity17 says the editors told him they were considering the " @entity19 " or the " @entity20			1
" " i thought ' maneuver ' sounded more appropriate , " he says			2
on tuesday , @entity17 , 94 , released his autobiography , " @entity17 's maneuvers			1
'' in the story about his 70 years in public health , the sometimes controversial thoracic surgeon recounts his early experiments testing the @entity20 on dogs , his life as a surgeon and researcher , and his time in the @entity32 stationed in @entity33 during @entity34 " many people think i came up with the maneuver by accident , " @entity17 says			1
" you know , i happened to fall against someone who was choking , that kind of thing			0
i first seriously considered the problem of choking when i read about the thousands of people who die each year			2
so i set about researching a better way , thinking , perhaps i could make use of air trapped in the chest to propel the object out of the trachea			0
" @entity17 began experimenting on anesthetized dogs and tried to push the air out using different methods			1
he found when he pushed just below the rib cage , the object he had placed in the dog 's throat shot out of its mouth every time			0
and that is mostly what the world knows about @entity17			1
but in his autobiography , the doctor details other inventions and medical theories he is proud to have been a part of			2
in the early 1950s , @entity17 started looking at how to help patients who had lost their ability to swallow due to a damaged esophagus			1
he began replacing the damaged esophagus with a part of the patient 's stomach			0
" people who had n't swallowed for decades -- who would feed themselves through a tube in the stomach -- were able to , for the first time , sit down with their family or go to a restaurant and eat normally , " @entity17 said			1
during the @entity79 , @entity17 invented a chest drain valve that allowed air and fluid to escape from the chest so that the patient 's lung filled with air , helping many wounded soldiers on the battlefield waiting for care			1
then in the 1980s , @entity17 invented the micro-trach transtracheal catheter , which allows people with serious lung conditions to receive oxygen more easily			1
" i would like people to appreciate that ever since i decided to be a doctor i 've wanted to help people , " @entity17 says			1
" i have seen people dying needlessly when in most cases , a simple technique was the solution			0
" but some of @entity17 's ideas have caused controversy in medical circles			1
@entity17 has argued his maneuver can be used for resuscitating drowning victims and for both acute and preventive treatment of asthma			1
the @entity109 does not support using the maneuver for drowning			0
( even for someone who 's choking , the agency 's first - aid procedure recommends first doing five back slaps and then five @entity17 abdominal thrusts			1
) other experts have noted cases where performing the @entity20 on a drowning victim did additional damage			0
as for asthma , medical experts have long questioned the maneuver 's effectiveness as a treatment			0
in an article published in @entity128 in 1997 , doctors noted that asthma is a disease of chronic inflammation ; while the @entity20 may help clear mucous plugs that form in the lungs , it wo n't treat the inflammation that causes an attack			0
only medication can do that			0
in @entity33 , @entity17 teamed up with local doctors to test another one of his theories : that malaria can be used to treat chronic lyme disease , cancer and @entity143			1
put simply , @entity17 believes purposefully injecting patients with the deadly disease and letting it go untreated for a few weeks will strengthen patients ' immune systems			2
the @entity149 opposes malarial therapy , and many medical experts have criticized @entity17 's testing methods , including his testing on human patients			1
@entity17 's son , @entity155 , writes a blog , on which he has spent years trying to draw attention to his father 's " wide - ranging , unseen history of fraud			2
" calling it a " family issue , " @entity17 does n't talk about his son , but says there is evidence to back up all his ideas			2
@entity155 has disputed his father 's account that @entity2 named the medical procedure after him			0
in response @entity0 contacted @entity2 , but the journal was unable to verify or discount either @entity17 's claim			2
@entity17 says there have been cases where individuals used the @entity20 to save a drowning victim or stop an asthma attack , and stands by his own studies that he says show malaria therapy has promise in improving the lives of hiv / aids patients			2
" all i am saying is that , before dismissing my ideas , let 's at least study them to evaluate their efficacy			0
" what is n't up for debate is that choking can be deadly , and the @entity20 has saved many lives			0
@entity17 estimates it has saved the lives of more than 50,000 people			1
" there 's been a lot of attention paid to the @entity20 because it 's so effective , but what i think makes it truly innovative is the fact that it 's accessible to everyone			0
anyone can save the life of a choking person -- even a child can perform the @entity207			0
" " @entity209 '' was published by @entity208 .			0

" many people think i came up with the maneuver by accident , " says dr. @entity17
in fact , the maneuver was developed after testing and experimenting on dogs
@entity17 , 94 , has written a new autobiography
