-- the @entity1 on thursday passed its version of the health care bill , inching the country closer to the biggest expansion of medical coverage since @entity7 was enacted more than four decades ago			1
@entity8 declared victory after the 60 - 39 party line vote , but one of the most complicated tasks is still ahead			0
a conference committee must reconcile the differences -- notably a public option , how to pay for the plan that emerges , and coverage for abortion -- and merge them into one			1
the @entity19 and @entity1 will then have to pass the revised plan before it can be sent to president @entity22 's desk			1
each chamber needs a simple majority vote for final passage			0
although the @entity19 wo n't be in session until january 12 , @entity19 staff will begin working through the differences on the two chambers ' bills , according to several @entity32 aides			2
leaders and committee chairmen will return in early january for health care meetings			0
@entity37 sen. @entity36 said the @entity19 and @entity1 bills are in some ways " irreconcilable			1
" @entity41 chairman @entity40 scoffed at the idea of negotiations			0
" there wo n't be a legitimate conference			0
the @entity19 members are being told to accept whatever the @entity1 bill comes up with , " he said on a conference call			1
but @entity8 and the @entity19 insist the bill that comes out of the conference will represent a huge step forward for health care reform			1
@entity53 , a congressional scholar with the @entity54 , agrees that the final bill will end up looking a lot like what came out of the @entity1			1
" are they dramatically different in some key respects ? yes			0
but you can reconcile two bills by picking one over the other , " @entity53 said			2
" the question that remains is can they get 218 @entity19 @entity8 to swallow the @entity66 , which means basically to swallow hard and accept something that is basically the product of the @entity1 , " he said			2
the @entity19 might be able to make changes around the margins , but that will be it , @entity53 said			2
the biggest difference between the two bills is the public option			1
the @entity19 bill has one ; the @entity1 bill does not			1
the @entity1 bill originally included a government - sponsored plan with the option for states to opt out , but that was dropped as senate majority leader @entity81 tried to secure the votes of moderate @entity8			1
the @entity1 bill instead allows nonprofit private insurers to offer coverage with approval of the @entity86 , which oversees the federal employees ' health plan			1
in asking @entity19 @entity8 to give up the public option , " the argument that is going to be made here to @entity19 @entity8 is , ' do you want a health bill or do you want nothing ? ' " @entity53 said			1
given the reality that there were n't the necessary 60 votes in the @entity1 for a public option , there was n't much discussion among @entity19 leaders about pushing hard for the @entity1 to include one in its bill			1
" they [ the @entity1 ] tried to see if they had support for it			2
that 's the reality , " a top @entity32 leadership aide told @entity0			0
" i think a lot of people are coming to terms with that and i do n't know how productive it would be to bring it out again			0
" another sticking point is coverage for abortion			0
a late compromise in the @entity19 led to the adoption of the @entity122 , which bans most abortion coverage from the public option			1
it would also prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies			0
a similar amendment introduced by sen. @entity131 failed in the @entity1			2
to get @entity131 's vote , a compromise was reached that allows states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in health plans offered in the insurance exchanges			0
individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage with their own money			0
as lawmakers work to merge the bills , there will be no other option than to pick the @entity131 compromise , @entity53 said			1
the real question is whether or not @entity32 rep. @entity152 " tries to lead an insurgent group of pro-life @entity8 away from the bill as a result of a compromise , " he added			0
the @entity19 and @entity1 bills also conflict on how to pay for the plans			1
the @entity19 plan is projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of @entity157 at a cost of more than $ 1 trillion over the next 10 years , according to the nonpartisan @entity159			2
the @entity1 plan is projected to cover 94 percent of @entity157 with an $ 871 billion price tag over the next 10 years , according to the @entity159			2
the @entity19 plan pays for health care reform with a 5.4 percent surtax on incomes for those making over $ 500,000 a year , as well as families earning more than $ 1 million			2
it also includes a 2.5 percent tax on medical devices sold in the @entity157			0
the @entity1 plan increases the @entity7 payroll tax on individuals earning more than $ 200,000 and couples earning more than $ 250,000 from the current 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent			0
the @entity1 bill also imposes a new tax on insurers that provide so - called " @entity178 " health plans valued at more than $ 8,500 for individuals and $ 23,000 for families			1
the 40 percent tax would be on the value of the plan			0
in addition , it imposes a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning salon treatments			0
both bills call for cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from @entity7 and @entity187			0
@entity53 said the funding mechanism is one area where the @entity19 might be able to pull some weight			1
how to handle illegal immigrants could pose another obstacle as lawmakers iron out their differences			0
the @entity19 bill mandates insurance coverage for illegal immigrants and allows illegal immigrants to enroll in the public option and to buy private coverage in the national insurance exchange , but prohibits government subsidies for such private coverage			1
the @entity1 plan exempts illegal immigrants from the health coverage mandate , and prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in the insurance exchanges			0
despite the differences , @entity53 predicts a bill will likely come out of conference quickly , although it wo n't be a smooth process			2
" part of the reason they are going to jump up and scream in outrage is , once you get down to the point where you need every vote , as we saw with the @entity1 example , it 's a great way to extract favors			1
" @entity0 's @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

conference committee must merge @entity19 , @entity1 bills
bills differ on public option , abortion *language* , funding
final bill will look a lot like the @entity1 bill , congressional scholar says
lawmakers might try to extract favors in final negotiations , @entity53 says
