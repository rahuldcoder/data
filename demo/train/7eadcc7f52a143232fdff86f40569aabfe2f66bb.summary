@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's an eerie stillness about the desolate buildings and empty streets of @entity0			1
from the main square , overgrown with brambles and wild grass , the town looks like an ancient ruin lost in a jungle			2
buildings , windows smashed , stand like monolithic giants peering down			0
on one , an unlit neon sign saying " restaurant " clings onto a rooftop			0
from another , a hammer and sickle looms over the scene below			0
i ca n't think of a single place i 've visited that feels so utterly abandoned and lost			0
the order to evacuate @entity0 came too late			0
it had been 36 hours since an explosion in @entity29 at @entity30 , on april 26 , 1986 , had spewed its radioactive debris over the town			1
fearing panic , the then @entity35 authorities , under @entity36 , ordered @entity0 's citizens to continue life as normal			1
so , as the world 's worst nuclear accident wreaked havoc , searing with radiation all in its path , children in this town went to school and sat through lessons			1
when the evacuation did get under way , once the scale of disaster could no longer be denied , residents were told they would be back in a few days			2
they took nothing with them -- just documents , some money and some food for the bus ride			0
even inside the @entity35 , the disgraceful way the situation was handled by the authorities was severely criticized			1
on several occasions since , @entity36 -- remembered for his perestroika and glasnost reforms -- said he believed @entity30 was equally responsible for bringing about the collapse of the @entity35			1
even 25 years on , the problem of @entity30 has far from gone away			1
there is considerable debate over how many people died , and how many are still dying , as a result of the calamity			0
the @entity72 and the @entity73 say 28 emergency workers died of radiation sickness in the immediate aftermath of the disaster			2
about 20 more who received high doses of radiation died of various causes in the following years , and as many as 4,000 cancer deaths are expected as a result of the disaster , according to those @entity86 agencies			2
the @entity87 of @entity1 , which supports survivors of the disaster , says 140,000 people who took part in the cleanup have died in the past quarter - century			1
but it is not clear how many of those fell victim to radiation			0
meanwhile , researchers say that in addition to spikes in certain types of cancers , there is evidence of severe anxiety among survivors			0
@entity1 's government says an area larger than @entity107 was affected , and a 30 - km ( 19 - mile ) radius around the plant remains all but uninhabited			1
and the impact is unlikely to diminish anytime soon			0
nuclear disasters like @entity30 and @entity112 do n't run on a human timeline			2
limited numbers of tourists are allowed into the accident zone for brief visits , despite radiation being well above normal , but scientists say generations may pass before it is entirely safe for people to return .			1

@entity1 city remains a ghost town 25 years after @entity30
tourists are now allowed into the *exclusion* zone
*estimates* of the disaster 's death toll vary *widely*
@entity36 says the disaster contributed to the @entity35 collapse
