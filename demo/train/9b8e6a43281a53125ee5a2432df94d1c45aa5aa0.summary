-- the streets of @entity2 finally look like a tranquil @entity4 town again			0
children can safely go back to school			0
and after @entity9 was laid to rest , residents are honoring his family 's wish for peace			2
but now a different kind of strife looms : the legal battle over whether @entity2 police officer @entity17 was justified in shooting and killing the unarmed teenager			1
here 's what to expect as the case moves forward : a grand jury will weigh the case twelve members of a local grand jury will decide whether to bring charges against @entity17			1
the grand jury started hearing testimony last week , but it could take two months before jurors reach a decision			1
the grand jury must weigh two questions : whether a crime was committed , and whether there is " probable cause " that the accused person -- in this case , @entity17 -- committed the crime			1
so who are these jurors ? the panel consists of nine white members ( six men and three women ) and three black members ( two women and one man ) , the @entity39 administrator said			0
but their proceedings will not be open to the public			0
and that does n't please @entity9 's family			2
" it 's about transparency , " family attorney @entity51 said			2
" this community has a distrust for the local enforcement officials			0
so if you have a secret grand jury proceeding , where nobody knows what the prosecutor presents ... and the grand jury comes back and says we find this ( shooting ) justified , i think that 's going to be very problematic for this community to accept			1
" a high bar for a conviction " it 's very tough to convict an officer -- especially once you put all this information out and the jury pool has been tainted , " @entity70 , a retired chief deputy @entity71 marshal , told @entity0 's @entity73			1
attorney @entity78 put it more bluntly : " i do n't think he can get a conviction , " said @entity78 , who represented the family of @entity81			0
like @entity9 , @entity81 was an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by a white police officer			2
" the grand jury is relegated -- or limited -- to the evidence put before them , and i 'm just not confident that they 're going to put all of the evidence before the grand jury			1
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity91 said that even if @entity9 was trying to get away from the officer , the @entity94 case @entity95 allows the use of deadly force when an alleged felon is trying to flee if " the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others			1
" a high bar for the officer , too but given the number of times @entity9 was shot -- along with newly released audio that may show a pause in rapid gunfire -- @entity17 has a lot of explaining to do			1
" evidence suggests that he was n't fleeing and was facing the officer , " @entity91 said			2
" if that 's true ... the officer has to explain six shots			1
he has to explain a reason for each of those six shots			1
he has to have justifiably been in fear of his life or fear of some imminent serious bodily harm			0
" the officer may also have to explain the audio recording , which was taken by a man near the shooting site and apparently reveals a gap in gunfire , which lasted at least 10 shots			1
@entity0 can not independently verify the authenticity of the tape			0
the civil rights investigation while a local grand jury considers the case , a federal civil rights investigation is also under way			1
proving a civil rights violation in this case requires proving that @entity17 exhibited " racial hostility , " @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity139 said			1
@entity17 is white , and @entity9 was african - american			2
opinion : can peace come to @entity2 ? challenges to returning to the police force @entity17 is on paid administrative leave and would have to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty , @entity149 police chief @entity148 said			2
but it 's possible that @entity17 will not come back			2
" there are many officers that have separated from service after an incident like this , " former @entity155 police commissioner @entity154 told @entity0 's @entity73			0
" they can no longer work in the environment where these incidents occurred			0
" protests will continue while many residents hope to avoid the tear gas and @entity169 cocktails that flew through the night sky last week , more protests are expected tuesday			0
demonstrators will gather at 6 p.m. for a march on @entity173 , said capt. @entity174 of the @entity175			0
and @entity177 will file a class - action lawsuit tuesday on behalf of injured and arrested protesters , the organization said			0
the suit will target @entity149 , @entity2 police and the mayor of @entity2			0
