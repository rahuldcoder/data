in 1995 , @entity0 seemed united beyond expectation , having rallied around an unlikely ambassador for racial change in a highly - fractured country			1
the @entity6 ' triumph at that year 's @entity7 seemed to herald the birth of the @entity9 , with white team captain @entity10 accepting the @entity11 from @entity12 , the first post-apartheid president			1
we seemed invincible , or at least it felt that way at the time			2
i remember every game of that tournament -- every scrum , every try , every drop - goal			2
i also remember how the crowd at our local watering hole -- the place to be to watch the matches - changed			2
what started off as a predominately white audience soon changed until we were shoulder to shoulder with people of all races			2
when we drove the streets of @entity32 after winning the final , honking our horns and singing " shoshaloza " -- which means " go forward " -- we were n't white or black , we were @entity0			1
springboks overpower @entity37 in 12 - try romp at @entity7 it was the first time i can remember really feeling that way , and everyone was hopeful that it would last			1
given the drama of that tournament , and the publicity that followed , it was only natural that rugby became more popular among races other than white			1
@entity49 became the face of what @entity0 rugby could be , and soon there were a number of talented black players getting @entity57 caps			1
but it was n't all smooth sailing			2
for a while there was a quota system -- for white - dominated sports such as rugby and cricket there had to be a certain number of players of color on the squad			2
my reaction to the requirement was similar to most of those around me : we were outraged			2
holders @entity0 scrape past @entity76 in 2011 opener it seemed like a no - win situation : players of color were bound to be treated as second - rate or lacking , regardless of their ability to play			1
the ones that would have made the squad despite the quota system were hurt the most			0
thankfully the practice was done away with , and @entity6 ( @entity88 ) focused more on developing school - age players of color so coaches would have a more representative base from which to select			1
@entity88 president @entity93 points out that the organization sets aside 20 million rand ( $ 2.75 million ) each year with the specific goal of transforming the future of @entity0 rugby to include more players of color			1
clinics have been set up in disadvantaged areas and rugby is more prominent in schools that typically have been soccer - crazy			2
it has , for the most part , worked -- there are more players of color moving up the ranks from schoolboy rugby to professional levels			2
what does n't make sense is that only three players of color made the squad for this @entity7 , two of whom also played in @entity0 's victorious 2007 campaign			1
@entity93 argues that @entity0 rugby is still suffering from the effects of apartheid			1
" this is a multifaceted challenge , " he told @entity123			0
" we 're still plagued by the effects of the past , we still live in predominately separate residential areas			0
there is change , but it 's not quick enough and these issues are something we have to face as a society			0
" @entity93 believes that club rugby remains a problem			2
he maintains that there would be more change if the advantaged clubs opened their doors to players of color			0
the same can be said for provincial rugby			2
@entity93 said provincial teams are completely autonomous from the ruling body			0
they have their own constitutions which @entity88 can not interfere with			0
if provincial teams do n't include players of color in their squads , then the national side is almost forced to do the same because the selection depth just is n't there			0
it 's not that there are n't any good players of color who want to play @entity6 rugby , it 's that there 's a drop - off between school and provincial rugby selection , and the club situation does n't help either			1
more needs to be done to move players up through the ranks and onto the national squad			0
local media recently picked up on a report which said teams could soon be forced to include a certain number of players of color in their team , or face penalties including docked points and / or fines			0
this measure , however , is unlikely to be implemented as the teams themselves would have to vote on it			0
@entity93 doubts it would pass , but recognizes that @entity88 needs the provincial teams to transform faster than they presently are			0
it seems that the racial make - up of the national side is routinely brought into question right before a big tournament , such as the @entity7			1
former @entity88 media adviser and rugby commentator @entity184 believes @entity0 have been " blinkered by success			1
" when the team does well , it 's as if rugby in @entity0 , and the country in general , has changed			1
when the team is doing poorly , everyone 's an analyst and we 're back to 1993			0
@entity184 does n't believe that there 's enough consistency in the transformation effort			0
he criticizes @entity93 for failing to achieve @entity88 's stated goal of seven colored players being included in the squad for this year 's tournament			0
@entity93 has asked for more time to work on the issue , saying society needs to change before the squad will reflect the new @entity0			1
@entity184 is frustrated with the lack of accountability within @entity88			0
he accuses the body of playing politics and avoiding making unpopular decisions			0
@entity93 maintains his hands are tied -- he needs more cooperation from the lower - level teams			0
it seems we 're just running in circles			0
both @entity184 and @entity93 agree that @entity0 is still racially divided			1
@entity184 notes that , as a nation , @entity0 has n't learned how to deal with life post-apartheid			1
it 's still the white elephant in the room			0
it 's not just the players on the field who are mostly white , it 's the spectators too -- match tickets are priced so high that typically only wealthy , usually white , @entity0 can afford to attend			1
@entity93 does n't believe it 's an issue of money , he says it 's a question of trying to get people to mix racially and accept each other			0
to help , @entity88 has announced that next year it will be holding a test match in @entity231 , the country 's largest township			0
moves like that are in the right direction , but it will take time before we have another " @entity240 " moment for @entity239 to recreate			0
to me , a @entity0 now living in the @entity242 , it seems that @entity0 rugby is in a better state than it was @entity246 1995 , but not where it could be			1
we can be proud of the fact that we 're one of only two countries to lift the @entity11 twice , and that we 're still considered a rugby powerhouse			2
but perhaps indicative of how far @entity0 still has to go , popular rugby commentator @entity250 recently resigned from his job at a local radio station after hurling a racial slur at a co-worker , during a team - building retreat , over an unpaid loan			1
@entity250 has apologized profusely but the incident prompted @entity258 , a leading sport channel for whom he was a freelancer , to drop him from the team sent to @entity262 to cover the @entity7			1
it might be that @entity0 need to come together more before the boys on the pitch reflect the make - up of the country , but i 'd like to think that rugby has the ability to be a game - changer off the field			1
it could serve as the example others would follow			0
we do n't need to wait for the rest of society to catch up , we can show them how it 's done and get closer to once again being @entity0 first -- and black or white second .			1

@entity0 seeking to retain @entity7 title in @entity262
@entity6 ' first triumph in 1995 was a big boost for post-apartheid nation
its rugby union is *battling* to make the game more *accessible* for all races
@entity7 is still mainly popular with whites , despite attempts to bring in quotas
