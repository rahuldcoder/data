-- i recently interviewed more than 60 chief executives of very large global companies			2
virtually all of them said that recruiting and promoting general managers with true leadership potential was the key ingredient to their organization 's long - term success			1
but the @entity11 were then quick to admit that this task is much easier said than done			2
time and again , externally recruited " stars , " as well as freshly promoted general managers from within their companies ' ranks , failed to live up to lofty expectations			1
this leads to an important question : why are we bad at picking good leaders ? the short answer is , we focus on all the wrong things , like a candidate 's charm , their stellar résumé or their academic credentials			1
none of this has any bearing on leadership potential			1
and despite claims to the contrary , even a candidate 's past results have little bearing on whether the promoted individual will succeed once promoted			1
want to be a leader ? act like one at best , a " track record " tells only half of the story			1
in a new position , the candidate will have to face new obstacles , deal with a new team , manage more people introduce new products and do it all without a clear road map			2
so what qualities should you focus on before handing out the next big promotion or making big promotion decision ? one thing is certain : you better get it right			1
nothing short of your reputation , and your organization 's success , are at stake			0
let 's cut to the chase			0
there are seven fundamental leadership qualities that the candidate must possess to be effective			1
take just one of these away , and sooner or later , the newly elevated manager will fail			0
having studied the careers of nearly 1,000 executives , over the past decade , it is clear to me that failure results when a leader lacks of one or more of these seven attributes			1
integrity it all starts with integrity			0
like a foundation for any well - constructed house , integrity is the core foundation for leadership effectiveness			0
it is a blend of honesty , consistency and ethics			0
once integrity is squandered or even thrown into doubt , it is very hard for a leader to regain the trust of his or her troops			1
passion yet integrity alone does n't matter without several other key attributes			0
@entity95 , for example , enables a leader to keep moving forward even in tough times			1
@entity101 , the ceo of @entity102 , was ridiculed in 2001 for clinging to a company that many called " @entity104			0
" it is now valued at $ 89 billion			0
@entity101 told me that it was his inner passion that fueled his drive to keep pushing forward even in the darkest days of the dot - com crash , when the company was teetering on the brink of collapse			0
courage courage , another make - it - or - break - it quality , is necessary to make the difficult decisions when facing conflicts and mediating adversity			0
courage springs from a leader 's core values and commitment to a vision			1
vision without a compelling vision or destination , how can a boss effectively persuade people to embark upon a new direction ? visionary leaders inspire employees to imagine a better future and work hard to achieve it			1
@entity135 : how to lead with purpose judgment actually achieving this vision , however , requires judgment			0
good judgment allows the leader to make solid business decisions and choices			1
when i assess an aspiring leader , i want to see whether she can confront a complex new challenge and quickly zero in on the most important issues			1
does she ask good questions ? can she prioritize and make difficult tradeoffs ? does she know where to focus and where not to waste her time and energy ? even when looking at an individual piece of the problem , does she keep the entire chessboard in mind , recognizing the potential unintended consequences of her decisions ? judgment is needed to develop a strategy that will enable the organization to achieve its vision			1
empathy no matter the organization , diversity of its people is the one constant			0
each team member has a different personality , motivation and underlying agenda			0
empathy is the attribute that allows a leader to effectively understand what makes other people tick			1
identifying the fundamental drivers of their bosses , peers and subordinates is critical			0
same goes for getting people aligned and motivated around their common goals			0
outside your specific organization , it is invaluable that a leader be able to quickly and accurately figure out why an important customer seems dissatisfied , even though they say everything is fine			1
if a potential employee does n't have empathy , they have very little chance of getting these , and many other , important constituents on their side			2
lack of empathy is a key reason why otherwise analytically brilliant leaders often come up short			2
emotional intelligence while empathy is externally focused , another key leadership attribute , emotional intelligence , is internally focused			0
an emotionally intelligent leader habitually takes a hard , honest look at himself and accurately discerns his strengths , weaknesses and blind spots			2
putting personal pride aside , he actively solicits the input of others and incorporates the team 's best ideas into the overall action plan			0
without emotional intelligence , hubris sets in , and a leader will overestimate his own ability and alienate others			2
even though the hubris may convince him that he can bite off more than he can chew , subordinates will not be so blind			0
a leader who continuously lets down his or her team wo n't stay in the organization 's good graces for long			2
from my vantage point , a lack of emotional intelligence is probably the top derailer of previously successful managers moving into fundamentally new and ambiguous roles			0
these seven leadership attributes -- integrity , vision , judgment , passion , courage , empathy and emotional intelligence -- are all the hallmarks of great leaders , regardless of industry or geography			2
by gearing any candidate assessment towards these traits -- and away from false predictors of success , like a sparkling personality , a polished résumé or good interview skills -- you will be one big step ahead of the rest of the crowd who are still scratching their heads wondering why they are so bad at picking good leaders			2
