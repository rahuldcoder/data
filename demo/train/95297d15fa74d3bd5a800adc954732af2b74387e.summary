seven - time world champion @entity11 , who finished his career with @entity4 in 2012 , remains in hospital in a medically - induced coma after a skiing accident at the end of december			1
the new @entity4 car -- the first 2014 car out on track tuesday at the @entity20 circuit in @entity21 -- ran with the message " @entity23 , " on its silver livery			1
the @entity5 team , who @entity11 raced for between 1996 and 2006 , also showed their support for their five - time world champion in @entity21			1
on the eve of the first day of winter testing , the team 's crew posed with a pit board showing the message " @entity35 " while the new @entity37 scarlet racer made its track debut in @entity20 with the same words of encouragement			1
@entity5 plan to post 72 messages of support for @entity11 on their website to represent each of his wins with the @entity48 team			1
on tuesday , the team published a note from @entity51 , who won two world championships for @entity5 in the 1970s , which read : " @entity35 , every day i follow your improvements and every day i am close to you			1
i hope i can speak to you very , very soon ! " @entity11 is stable but remains in a coma at the @entity59 hospital as he fights the effects of a serious head injury , sustained in a skiing accident at the @entity64 resort of @entity65 on 29 december			1
his family have said the messages of support have given them strength but they have also asked for privacy from the clamoring media interest in his condition			2
many dedicated motorsport journalists have turned their attention to @entity20 , where 10 of the 11 @entity1 teams are due to trial their new look cars on track and put this season 's major rule changes to the test			2
@entity86 , with the help of new @entity85 teammate @entity84 , unveiled the new @entity87 that he hopes will power him to a fifth straight world title			2

" there 's a lot going on , the technology behind it is very complex			0
" @entity1 has ripped up the rulebook for the 2014 season , which opens with the @entity85 @entity97 on 16 march			0
the 2014 @entity1 rule changes explained the cars are now powered by 1.6 - liter @entity101 turbo engines which also rely on a greater use of hybrid energy -- recovered through braking and from the car 's exhaust gases			2
the unveiling of thinner , lower nose cones and narrower front wings , to comply with new design rules , has also raised eyebrows			0
with so many major changes , @entity87 team boss @entity114 , speaking to the media in @entity21 , warned : " i think it 's dangerous sometimes to be over confident that you have all the elements in place for the start of any season			2
" we 've enjoyed great continuity over the last few years - we 've got a strong driver lineup , we 've got a strong tech lineup , we 've got great strength in depth			0
" but you ca n't take anything for granted - @entity1 , like any sport , can be unpredictable at times			0
" at the end of the opening day of the test , @entity86 had ticked off just three laps in his brand new @entity87 and did not set a fastest time			2
" it was difficult to get an impression of what the new car is like , " @entity86 told reporters			0
" we were n't quite ready this morning and things took a little bit longer than expected			0
it was impossible to get a feeling for it today			0
" @entity143 , the 2009 world champion , did n't get to take his @entity144 out of the garage for a spin after the team 's progress was hampered by electrical issues			1
@entity5 set the fastest time of the day with their returning 2007 world champion , @entity150 , at the helm just outpacing the @entity4 of @entity152 , who set a lap time of one minute 27.80 seconds			1
" from a driving point of view , i did n't feel any amazing difference , although it 's much too early to give an opinion on this , " @entity150 told the @entity5 website			1
" overall , we can say it was a good start			0
" @entity152 was also pleased with his first day at work , despite crashing his mercedes after just 18 laps			0
