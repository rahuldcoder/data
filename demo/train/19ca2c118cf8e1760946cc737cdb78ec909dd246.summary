@entity8 , who is the defending champion at the @entity23 event , lost in the quarterfinals at @entity25 and @entity26 to @entity27 and @entity28 to show rare vulnerability on his favorite surface			2

meanwhile in the women 's @entity74 tournament in @entity19 , @entity72 will play @entity76 of @entity77 in sunday 's final			1
@entity72 , fresh off her @entity79 success , brushed aside @entity80 to advance to the tile match in @entity19 for a second straight year			2
the @entity82 built on a fast start and despite a second set rally from @entity80 was a 6 - 1 6 - 4 winner			0
" it 's great to have these results , over @entity88 in the world today and yesterday beating @entity90 , who is @entity91 in the world			0
these were my goals at the beginning of the season , physically and mentally after a long layoff , " she said			0
by contrast , the other semifinal was a close and grueling affair , with @entity76 eventually prevailing 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 2 in two hours 36 minutes against former @entity102 champion @entity101			0
@entity76 , bidding for her eighth title since last year 's @entity19 tournament , trailed a set and 3 - 1 before winning eight straight games to take a stranglehold on the match			1
