-- the daily toll of gun murders , and the increasing frequency and scale of mass shootings , have finally forced @entity6 to rethink gun policy			1
predictably , emotions are running high on tv talk shows and congressional panels			0
so it 's a good time to remind ourselves that @entity13 -- including gun owners -- actually agree about what to do now , and have for a very long time			1
from requiring criminal background checks on all gun sales to getting military - style assault weapons off our streets , @entity13 understand that it 's entirely possible to respect the rights of law - abiding gun owners and do much more to keep people safe			1
the nation may be politically divided , but on guns there has long been a broad and enduring consensus			2
the only people who seem to disagree are the @entity31 's @entity6 lobbyists			1
what was once a modest gun rights and gun safety organization is long gone			2
today , as @entity37 mayor @entity36 has said , it is principally a marketing organization , and its flagship product is fear			0
opinion : gun extremists ' alternate reality this sad development was on full display during wednesday 's @entity48 hearing on gun violence , where @entity31 executive vice president @entity50 claimed that background checks for gun buyers -- a two - minute process that most gun buyers are happy to undergo -- will become " a universal federal nightmare imposed upon law - abiding people all over the country			1
" as an alternative , @entity50 has suggested that the answer to guns is more guns -- in the hands of almost anyone , in almost every place in @entity13 : every classroom , every daycare center , every movie theater , every shopping mall , every place of worship			1
if more guns in more places is the @entity31 's proposal , we 've run a pretty good pilot project -- and the results are n't good			1
the @entity13 already has more firearms per capita than any other nation , making it the most heavily armed civilian population in the world			1
we have a gun murder rate that is about 15 times higher than other populous , high - income countries			1
this correlation has lost the power to surprise -- except perhaps for @entity50 , who believes " the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun			2
" complete coverage : the gun debate if only it were that simple			2
this is n't just about good guys and bad guys			0
very often , the good guys get shot by bad guys with guns			0
this is about smart policies and dangerous ones			0
gun owners know this , too			1
those like my dad , a former firearms dealer in @entity107 , are mainstream @entity13 with mainstream views on guns			2
that 's why 74 % of @entity31 members and 87 % of @entity113 gun owners believe all gun buyers should get a criminal background check			1
a @entity118 / @entity117 poll released on january 17 found 93 % of those living in households with gun owners and 85 % in households with @entity31 members support background checks			1
they believe we have the right to bear arms , and they believe with rights come responsibilities			0
an instant background check is not too high a price to pay , when we know the current system -- even with big loopholes -- has saved many lives			0
we have the right to go to the movies without being gunned down in our seats			0
we have the right to pray in our houses of worship without being victimized by a mentally unstable young man and his assault weapon			0
more than anything , we have the right to send our kids to school in the morning with the guarantee that they 'll return home in the afternoon			0
opinion : why the @entity31 fights for gun rights until lawmakers stand up to the gun lobby and stand up for the people they represent , the death toll will only continue to rise -- 33 people murdered with guns , every day , everywhere , in the world 's indispensable nation			1
when they do , they 'll have major police organizations , survivors of gun violence , faith leaders , domestic violence opponents , many millions of parents , and more than 850 @entity167 standing with them			0
if it 's electoral retribution they 're worried about , they should look at the last election			0
after investing more millions than ever to defeat president @entity174 and elect pro-gun politicians , the @entity31 had one of the worst success rates of all political groups : a 0.83 % return on a massive investment of its members ' hard - earned money			1
we can pass commonsense gun laws that will save many lives			0
the @entity13 people are demanding it , the president is demanding it , the families of the dead are demanding it			2
it 's time for our leaders to buck the @entity31 's @entity6 lobbyists			1
it 's not as hard as they think			0
