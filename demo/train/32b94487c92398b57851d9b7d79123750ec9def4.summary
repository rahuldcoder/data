-- @entity3 is tapping intently on his smartphone , his slight frame bookended by a dark mop of hair and bright blue sneakers			1
curled into a @entity9 couch , he appears oblivious to the fuss going around him			2
upstairs , a young blogger desperate for face time is stalking the corridors trying to catch him between interviews			0
meetings are running over and a spare room has to be found for the overflow			0
the 18 year old is a phenomenon of the tech world , and a star speaker at this year 's @entity23 conference in @entity24			2
@entity3 created @entity25 , an aggregation app , from his bedroom before selling it to @entity29 for a reported $ 30 million in march			1
he initially explored the idea to help him with his studies , identifying a need to deliver concise and accurate representation of text			0
in a deal that made headlines around the world , @entity29 folded the app into its own , and hired @entity3 as a product manager			1
for @entity3 , @entity25 has created a concept which can be expanded into fields like multimedia , which he 's now exploring at @entity29			1
he 's also fascinated by the popularity of what he calls " ephemerality reacting to human interaction , " as represented by @entity48 , the app in which content vanishes after it 's been viewed			1
for @entity3 , this reflects human biology and could be a natural progression for technology			1
" when we have a conversation , we forget what we say in an hour , in 24 hours , and there is this really nice retention curve , it decreases to i think 5 % , " he says			0
" there are certain kinds of conversations which you do n't necessarily want to be permanent , and it 's an interesting concept			0
" as @entity25 crunches information , apps like @entity48 reflect the transience of human interaction -- concepts which are more intertwined than are immediately obvious , @entity3 says			1
" when i am telling you a story , i do try and summarize it , " he says			0
" i wo n't tell you everything word for word , so again like a lot of these concepts are more intertwined then you think			0
you are taking human behavior , and interaction and distilling them down			2
" but while @entity48 evaporates content , others leave deep data footprints , seemingly setting up a collision of ideas			1
" you have wearables on one side of the spectrum , and that 's almost encouraging permanency by its very nature , this idea of archiving everything and filming everything , " @entity3 says			1
" then you have almost like the antithesis , which are these very ephemeral , disappearing message services , and @entity48 , and @entity98 and group chat ... and i do n't know how they are quite going to collide			1
they are coming from different sides of the spectrum			0
" @entity3 now spends the bulk of his time at @entity29 , although he structures his life to keep order around priorities including continued education and driving lessons			1
his best friends and girlfriend remain the same and as close to @entity3 as before he was catapulted onto the global stage			2
his 18th birthday last month consisted of a surprise dinner with family and friends , a low key celebration for someone who might have been tempted to reach for the finest champagne			0
@entity3 gesticulates rapidly as he articulates ideas on topics that range from linguist theory , philosophy , biology and mathematics			1
but he calls himself a hobbyist ; someone who wants to learn			0
he idolizes figures like @entity129 , whose extraordinary talents allowed him to straddle intellectual and artistic disciplines			0
@entity3 's current intellectual hero is @entity133 , a @entity134 mathematician who , in the late 1800s , proved infinity came in different sizes			2
" i 'm fascinated by this form of maths , because to me trying to understand something as complex and transcendent as infinity actually ends up solving of lot of problems to do with artificial intelligence and knowledge , " @entity3 says			2
then he slips into teen talk , for a second			0
" these figures are just kind of cool , for me anyway , obviously not cool , in like , cool , cool , but cool as in intellectually cool			0

@entity3 , now 18 - years old , sold his app @entity25 to @entity29 for a reported $ 30 million
he is now working for @entity29 as a product manager , as the company continues its *acquisition* drive
he sees a future where apps like @entity48 , where information disappears , as reflecting human biology
that could set up a clash with the heavy *digital* footprint of other apps
