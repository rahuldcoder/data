@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 court convicted 11 @entity5 militants monday of membership in a terrorist group , but acquitted them of a " specific " conspiracy to carry out an attack on @entity11 's metro subway system , as prosecutors alleged			1
the court instead said there was a more general decision by the group , linked to @entity16 , to use explosives against @entity11 's metro , but that a specific date and place had not been determined , nor had a sufficient amount of explosives been assembled , according to a copy of the sentence viewed by @entity2			1
the judges ruled the alleged @entity11 plot had " not advanced sufficiently " to constitute a crime of conspiracy under @entity1 law			1
the alleged plot in january 2008 had raised alarm bells in @entity32 because @entity1 authorities said there were to be a series of attacks , starting with suicide bombings on the @entity11 metro , and then other attacks in @entity1 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 , if successive demands from a @entity42 @entity41 leader and @entity16 were not met			1
the trial against 10 @entity42 men and an @entity51 national was held last month			0
all proclaimed their innocence and many refused to answer prosecutors questions			0
the three - judge panel at the @entity57 ruled on monday that all 11 belonged to a terrorist group			1
two of the 11 also were convicted of possession of explosives , but nine others were acquitted on that charge			0
the 11 face prison terms of eight to 14 years			0
but @entity65 , a private prosecutor representing victims in the case , told @entity2 the sentence sets a precedent in @entity1 because the 11 defendants were convicted for terrorist group membership almost solely on the basis of a key police informant , known as @entity74 to protect his identity			1
@entity74 testified he was selected by the group 's leader to be a suicide bomber , and that he quickly made a secretive call from a bathroom at a @entity11 mosque to warn a friend in @entity45 about an impending terrorist attack			2
hours later , police swooped to make arrests in january 2008 in @entity11			2
the protected witness denied on the stand that he worked for @entity45 or any other secret service			0
defense lawyer @entity91 , on the team representing all 11 defendants , said the sentence lacked judicial merit and he vowed to appeal to @entity1 's @entity94			0
about 30 members of @entity11 's large @entity42 community watched the trial almost daily in a bulletproof basement courtroom at the high - security @entity57 in central @entity0			2
a community leader told @entity2 the defendants were innocent and that the @entity42 community in @entity11 was hardworking and law - abiding			0
more than 300 suspected @entity5 extremists have been arrested in @entity1 since the @entity0 commuter train bombings that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 on march 11 , 2004 , @entity1 's interior minister has said .			2

@entity57 convicts 11 @entity5 militants of belonging to terrorist group , but acquits them of conspiring to attack @entity11 's metro
judges ruled alleged @entity11 plot not advanced to constitute crime of conspiracy
alleged plot in january 2008 raised alarm bells with @entity1 authorities *fearing* series of attacks across @entity32
