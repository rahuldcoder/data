i just think she should be talking about her accomplishments , her achievements , rather than everything else that 's just getting attention and controversy , ' the @entity36 was quoted by the @entity45 's @entity44			1
" if she wants to talk about something personal , maybe she should talk about her relationship and her boyfriend that was married and is getting a divorce and has kids			2

" she 's 16 , why was she that drunk where she does n't remember ? it could have been much worse			0

the following day , @entity3 released a statement on her personal website , saying she was " deeply sorry for what was written in the @entity9 article			1

@entity1 said @entity3 would do well to steer clear of such issues			1
" i obviously have many opinions about different things in life , " she said			0

i 'm sure people want to know more , but yet i try to keep my personal life private			0
" if i speak to my friends , that 's one thing			0
but i do n't go out and try to create things that should n't be really talked about			0
