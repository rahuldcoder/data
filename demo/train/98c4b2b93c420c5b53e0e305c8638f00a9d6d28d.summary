-- @entity1 would make a great stand - up comic , not because he 's the funniest president ever but because he uses jokes the same way many of us comedians do : as a weapon			1
traditionally , the ( intentionally ) funny lines by our presidents have had one thing in common : they were self - deprecating			1
sure , some presidents have used jokes to take jabs at their opponents , but not to the extent of @entity1			1
during his tenure , he has increasingly unleashed biting comedic barbs against his critics and political adversaries			0
these jokes are intended to do more than simply entertain you			0
@entity1 's humor is often delivered the way a comedian dealing with a heckler would do it			1
he tries to undermine his opponents with it and get the crowd -- in this case the public -- on his side			0
i can assure you that having a crowd laugh at your critic / heckler is not only effective in dominating them , it 's also very satisfying			2
let 's look at some of the more typical self - deprecating jokes made by presidents at past @entity50 ' dinners , where press and president unleash their biting wits on one another			1
in 1988 , @entity55 joked about his advanced age by commenting that his staff had claimed that " preparing me for a press conference was like reinventing the wheel			0
i was around when the wheel was invented , and it was easier			0
" president @entity63 , at the @entity62 , mentioned that he was a fan of that night 's comedian , @entity64 : " because , together , we give hope to gray - haired , chunky baby boomers everywhere			2
" and then there was president @entity68			0
there are no words to describe my gratitude for all the material he provided comedians			0
but he could also be intentionally funny at his own expense			0
gallery : president @entity1 : a year in facial expressions at the @entity79 , @entity68 took out a book written about his verbal gaffes and reviewed them with the audience			2
one of the funniest moments was regarding his famous grammatically incorrect line " rarely is the question asked : ' is our children learning ? ' " @entity68 then comically explained , " if they would read it closely , they would see i 'm using the transitive plural tense , so the word ' is ' are correct			0
" now , let 's look at @entity1			1
yes , he has often used self - deprecating humor			1
for example , at the 2011 @entity96 , he joked , " some people now suggest that i 'm too professorial			0
and i 'd like to address that head - on by assigning all of you some reading that will help you draw your own conclusions			0
" but here 's where @entity1 has increasingly taken presidential comedy to a new place			1
at that same event , @entity1 took on two critics point - blank , using cutting humor			1
the first was the thin - skinned @entity112 , who at that time was considering running for president against @entity1 in 2012			1
@entity1 made three sharply barbed jokes at @entity112 's expense			1
one was about how trivial @entity112 's decisions on " @entity116 " were when compared with that of the @entity118			1
the second ridiculed @entity112 for what he would allegedly do to the @entity96 if he won : turn it into a garish - looking hotel and spa			2
and @entity1 mocked @entity112 's obsession with the " birther " issue by joking that , next , " @entity112 " would focus on topics like " did we fake the moon landing ? what really happened in @entity130 ? and where are @entity132 and @entity133 ? " @entity1 then took on actor @entity134 , who had been publicly critical of the president			1
@entity1 quipped , " @entity134 said he was disappointed in my performance			1
well , @entity134 , i just saw ' @entity137 , ' so right back atcha , buddy			2
" at the @entity139 , @entity1 took on his then - opponent @entity140 : " i guess gov. @entity140 is feeling pretty good about things , because he took a few hours off the other day to see ' @entity142			1
' ... it 's a movie about people who court wealthy sponsors and then brutally savage each other until only one contestant is left standing			0
i 'm sure this was a really good change of pace for him			0
" gallery : @entity1 's face all over the place and then at the @entity156 in @entity157 a few weeks before the most recent presidential election , @entity1 mocked @entity140 again : " earlier today , i went shopping at some stores in @entity159			1
i understand gov. @entity140 went shopping for some stores in @entity159			2
" and we even saw it on display again this week when @entity1 joked with @entity165 prime minister @entity164 that he was happy to be in the @entity166 because it 's , " good to get away from @entity168			2
" clearly , @entity169 house speaker @entity169 understood who @entity1 was targeting with this joke , telling @entity0 's @entity172 , " i 'd rather be heckled than ignored			2
" you can dismiss these as simply jokes , but then you are n't grasping how political comedy works			0
these jokes are funny but also have a message embedded within			0
for example , the jokes about @entity140 intentionally furthered the image @entity1 wanted to paint of @entity140 , namely that he was very wealthy and out of touch with the average person			1
the change in presidential humor , i believe , can be traced to the influence of " @entity187			0
" since 1999 , @entity188 has redefined political comedy , using it to entertain , educate and eviscerate			2
@entity1 and his joke - writers have simply embraced this style of political comedy to comically undermine critics			1
like it or not , those seeking the presidency in 2016 better do more than build a network of fundraisers and supporters			0
you 'd better work on your comedic barbs , because @entity204 politics is becoming the country 's toughest room to play			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity209 says @entity1 uses jokes like many comedians do : as weapons
he says presidents often make self - deprecating jokes , but @entity1 's can be barbed , too
he says @entity1 has aimed at @entity112 , @entity140 , @entity134 like a comic leveling a heckler
@entity209 : style draws from @entity188 , which educates , eviscerates
