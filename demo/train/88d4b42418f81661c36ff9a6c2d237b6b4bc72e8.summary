@entity0 -- why did @entity2 have to die ? that 's what people around @entity5 -- its officials , its authorities , its citizens -- asked themselves thursday , a day after the soldier was hit with a car , then hacked to death on a @entity0 street in broad daylight			1
there 's been no indication that the 25 - year - old machine gunner , drummer and father of a 2 - year - old boy knew the men who attacked him with meat cleavers			1
one of them who approached a man filming the gory scene in southeast @entity0 's @entity27 neighborhood suggested @entity2 had been targeted only " because @entity28 are dying daily " at the hands of @entity5 troops like him			1

@entity83 blamed wednesday 's attack not on his friend @entity85 -- who he says is the bloody , cleaver - wielding man shown talking in the video aired by @entity1 affiliate @entity88 -- but on the @entity5 government and predicted there may be more attacks			1
" as long as ( @entity5 ) foreign policy is engaging in violence , they 're only inviting violence in retaliation , " @entity83 told @entity1			1

@entity83 described his friend as a " very caring " man who " just wanted to help everybody			0
" he was also " very vocal " about his feelings that @entity28 were being oppressed , injustices he pinned , in part , on the @entity5 government			1
" i was n't surprised that it happened , " @entity83 said of wednesday 's attack			0
" ... @entity5 is only responsible , the government			1
and i believe all of us , as a public , we are responsible			0
we should condemn ourselves , why we did not do enough to stop these wars going on in @entity166 and @entity167			0
" the @entity27 bloodshed spurred concerns not only about violence by @entity99 extremists but also about attacks targeting @entity28 by people angry about @entity2 's killing			1

and people will break , " said @entity176 , a construction worker who heard shots ring out in @entity27 as police took on @entity2 's attackers			1

" " do n't listen to the @entity208 cover ups , the lies about @entity99 being peaceful , " read another @entity199 tweet thursday			2
political and social commentator @entity210 appealed for " a sense of calm ( and ) perspective " after what he called " a really , really heinous act of , i would say , criminality , ... not terrorism			0
