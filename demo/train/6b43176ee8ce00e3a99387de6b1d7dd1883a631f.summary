-- according to the @entity7 administration , the fact that @entity2 boarded a plane for the @entity4 with potentially exploding underwear was caused by a systemic failure in intelligence			1
in the same way that an auto accident is caused by two cars crashing together			0
saying the system failed is merely describing what happened , and @entity7 's plan will do nothing to address the underlying problem			1
the real problem is what we need to be talking about , not just because it 's at the core of our intelligence crisis , but because it 's the same problem that broke our economy , made health care unaffordable and hobbled the @entity4 auto industry			1
and unless the @entity28 gets smart about dealing with this larger problem , and fast , our skies wo n't be safer any time soon			0
the problem is organizational culture			2
as @entity35 , the late father of modern management , said : " culture eats strategy for breakfast			2
" culture says it 's ok to not think creatively about how a lead might connect to other information			1
culture says that following up on leads eventually is soon enough			2
culture says that doing what 's in our job description is " good enough for government work			1
" @entity7 's plan to fix the intelligence system boils down to integrate the components , clarify roles and responsibilities , add additional steps to the screening process , invest in newer technology , deploy more air marshals and work cooperatively with other governments			1
none of these actions will do one thing to effect people 's relationships with each other and with their work , which is the essence of culture			1
when we go through a @entity68 line in the @entity4 , we 're not blown away by organizational brilliance			0
we see people plodding through the same steps , in the same way , often doing the minimum to not get fired			0
( that 's not to say that all @entity68 cultures are that bad ; a few are quite effective			2
) most people assume that the culture in the intelligence community is better			1
actually , the odds are against it			0
in a study of 24,000 people published in 2008 in tribal leadership , @entity85 , @entity86 and i found that 25 percent of workplace cultures are as stupid as our worst @entity68 experiences			0
these groups express a " my life stinks " view and show almost no innovation , initiative or ownership -- precisely the behaviors necessary to reform our intelligence systems			1
even more frightening , 48 percent of organizational cultures express the view that " i 'm great ( and you 're not ) "			0
people in these workplaces rise to the challenge , but as individuals , not as groups			0
@entity110 performers hoard information , work on outshining each other and act with the real goal of advancing themselves			2
they hoard information , build silos and erect walls between groups			0
so imagine these two cultures -- accounting for about three out of four workplaces -- responding to @entity7 's plan to reform the intelligence system			1
people in " my life stinks " cultures will react by rolling their eyes , making sarcastic jokes and looking at their watches			0
people in " i 'm great " cultures will respond that the problems are easily solved as long as everyone gets behind their plan			0
the problem is , everyone is advancing their own ideas , and ultimately , their own careers			0
( sound like @entity141 ? ) as a consultant who logs almost as many miles as the @entity145 character in " @entity153 " and a scholar of organizational performance , i 've hoped that the @entity28 's reaction would focus on the heart of the problem , that the agencies and organizations that we rely on have stupid workplace cultures			1
i 'm not saying the people involved are stupid			0
i 'm saying the culture makes people stupider than they really are			2
( and while we 're on the subject , " my life stinks " is the dominant culture in the @entity4 auto industry , which is why it failed in the first place			2
and " i 'm great " cultures run @entity166 , which is why greed went unchecked until it became pathological			0
) until we target culture as the issue , all we 're accomplishing with systemic fixes is the illusion of action			1
no amount of @entity7 - style fixes will make a stupid culture any smarter , and remember , culture eats strategy -- and systems -- for breakfast			1
in his press conference , president @entity7 said , " ultimately , the buck stops with me			1
when the system fails , it is my responsibility			0
" the question is : why is no one taking responsibility for the cultures that produce these failures ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

" systemic failure " is not a real expla*nation* of @entity196 near attack , says @entity193
he says *patching* the *nation* 's *security* system is no substitute for a culture change
he says intelligence agencies need a culture of initiative and ownership
@entity193 : president @entity7 's fixes amount to the " illusion of action "
