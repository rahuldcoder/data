two years into the @entity2 conflict , president @entity0 has decided it 's finally time to explain it to the @entity6 people in a speech he will give from the @entity9 on tuesday			1
but from the beginning , president @entity0 's strategy in @entity2 -- if he ever had one -- has been confused			1
years of dithering , red lines that went unanswered , and a failure to persuade our international allies and the @entity6 public to get on board with the president 's nonplan plan , has resulted , not surprisingly , in a confused @entity22			1
on the @entity25 side , sen. @entity23 was against the president 's plan for limited intervention but on wednesday changed his mind			2
sen. @entity30 was for intervention in @entity2 for the past two years , but he can not support @entity0 's plan for military strikes			1
on the @entity40 side , many who have previously defended @entity0 's foreign policy as somehow morally superior to his predecessor for its caution and thoughtfulness now seem delighted to support his new war in @entity2			1
then there are @entity40 who seem a little less fuzzy on their long - held principles and do not support intervening in @entity2			0
@entity0 's own administration seems confused as well			1
secretary of state @entity46 has had to backpedal more than once after contradicting official policy in @entity2 , which is admittedly hard to discern			0
even gen. @entity48 , chairman of the @entity49 , has been an awkward spokesman , spending the better part of the past year telling @entity22 that @entity2 intervention was unwise			0
as @entity56 , a correspondent for the @entity57 puts it , " on tuesday , @entity48 was not much more helpful for the president 's case for war in the @entity55			2
he contradicted president @entity0 's contention from saturday that delays would not affect the @entity2 war plan , confirming the @entity2 military was adjusting to press leaks about an early plan			1
" the confusion is n't merely a consequence of the complicated machinations in @entity2 or the fog of war			0
everything we know now about the @entity2 conflict -- that president @entity72 has been killing his own people , that he possessed chemical weapons , that he had pipelines to @entity76 and @entity77 , and that @entity78 was circling the wagons hoping to exploit the chaos -- we knew in the first week of the conflict two years ago			2
president @entity0 is solely to blame for the confusion			1
his spectacular failure of leadership on the crisis is coming into clearer focus with every passing day			1
it 's possible he just did n't know what to do two years ago , and does n't know what to do now			0
@entity2 is a messy conflict with few good answers			0
but in piecing together the president 's moves in recent months , it 's clear he 's also very much concerned about protecting his own legacy			1
that means spreading the blame around to others			0
first , he made his best effort ( at the 11th hour ) to get international support for a short - term intervention that -- by his own admission -- was not meant to actually change the course of the war			0
i call this the beach house strategy			0
you want to buy a beach house , but ca n't afford it			0
so you go in with a few friends so that when the dishwasher breaks , no one person 's on the hook for it			0
one would hardly call that leadership , and it 's no wonder few wanted to join us in " not changing the course of the war " in @entity2			2
@entity0 does n't want to be responsible for the red lines he set either , apparently			2
he insisted that when it came to @entity72 's use of chemical weapons , " i did n't set a red line ; the world set a red line			1
" reactions to this absurd duck and cover were so immediate that the @entity128 dispatched spokespeople to explain the president 's contradictory remarks			2
while it 's true that international peace accords bar the use of chemical weapons , it 's baffling and shameful that @entity0 does n't proudly and defiantly own red lines against a dictator who would gas innocent children in the streets			2
" you 're damn right that 's my red line " -- would have been a far more impressive and effective message to the rest of the world			1
lastly , it seems clear the president does n't want ownership of his own initial plan for limited strikes in @entity2 merely meant to punish @entity72			2
i ca n't blame him there -- it 's an ill - conceived half - measure that even @entity155 rep. @entity155 likened to being impossibly " part pregnant			0
" after insisting he could go ahead with his plan even without @entity22 , he 's curiously allowing legislators to craft his strategy through resolutions and amendments that significantly alter the scope of his plans for intervention			0
if @entity0 truly believed his plan was the right one , and is prepared to move ahead without @entity22 , then why go through the charade of hearings ? i would venture it 's so that he can later claim that whatever we end up doing in @entity2 was largely the design of @entity23 and other members of @entity22			1
it 's a sad state of affairs			0
with so much at stake -- the stability of the region , the security of our allies , the spread of weapons of mass destruction , 100,000 deaths and @entity77 watching closely -- you 'd hope that the president of the @entity6 would summon the wisdom and courage to take a clear position on @entity2 , and then accept whatever credit or blame follows			0
instead , it seems the president 's primary concern in @entity2 is himself .			1

@entity195 : president @entity0 's strategy in @entity2 has been confused from the start
@entity199 : @entity0 's failure of leadership on the crisis is clearer with every passing day
she says the president sets the red line but then says the world sets the red line
@entity199 : it seems the president 's main concern in @entity2 is himself and his legacy
