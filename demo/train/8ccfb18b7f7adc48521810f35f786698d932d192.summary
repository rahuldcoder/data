@entity0 -- when @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity6 sgt. @entity5 used his city - issued text messaging pager to exchange hundreds of personal messages , some of a " sexually explicit " nature , did he have a right to expect those messages would be kept private ? the @entity14 decided monday that it will determine whether a police officer has a " reasonable expectation " of privacy on his official wireless two - way text - messaging pager			1
the justices accepted a pair of appeals on this free - speech and privacy dispute , and will hear oral arguments in the spring			1
at issue is how far a government employer may go to monitor the private communications of its workers when they believe that the use of such equipment is being abused			2
and the court will explore whether service providers can be held liable for providing those communications without the consent of the sender			0
courts have said that private communications -- even when delivered or transmitted through a public portal -- are generally protected from " unreasonable search and seizure , " such as handwritten letters sent in sealed envelopes through the @entity43			0
the department has a " @entity45 " that gives workers only limited use for personal communications			0
@entity5 signed a statement acknowledging that " use of these tools for personal benefit is a significant violation of @entity54 " and that " users should have no expectation of privacy or confidentiality when using these resources			2
" @entity5 , a @entity60 sergeant , claimed that he was unaware the city 's overall policy applied to the department and said there was an " informal policy [ that ] allowed officers to maintain their privacy in their text messages as long as they paid the overage charges			1
" the city 's contract with @entity72 , now known as @entity73 , allowed for a 25,000 - character limit per month , per device , before overage charges kicked in			2
@entity5 acknowledged that he exceeded the limit at least several times and paid the extra charges out of his personal funds , as required by his bosses			0
both sides agree that @entity5 's supervisor grew " tired of being a bill collector " of his text - happy officers , and the chief of police ordered a review of the pager transcripts for the two officers with the highest overage , one of whom was @entity5			2
officials claimed in court that the review was done only " to determine whether the city 's monthly character limit was insufficient to cover business - related messages			1
" it was only in reading the transcripts voluntarily provided by @entity72 from its electronic archives that the often - racy messages to his wife , his girlfriend and a fellow officer were revealed , prompting an internal department investigation			1
a review of one month found that @entity5 had sent and received 456 personal messages while on duty , an average of 28 per shift , and only three were deemed work - related			1
a federal court judge characterized many of the messages as not " light personal communications , " as defined in the policy as generally acceptable , but words that were , " to say the least , sexually explicit in nature			1
" @entity5 sued the wireless company and the city for invasion of privacy			1
that suit and any possible disciplinary action against the officer has been put on hold pending resolution of the larger legal questions			2
a federal appeals court had ruled for @entity129			2
because " the [ police ] department opted to review the contents of all the messages , work - related and personal , without the consent of @entity129 , we held that the search was excessively intrusive in light of the noninvestigatory object of the search , " wrote the three - judge panel			1
this case deals within the context only of government employees , and legal and technology experts are divided over its application in the private sector , where employees may enjoy less constitutional protection			2
the city of @entity3 is in @entity150 , about 37 miles east of @entity151			0
the case is @entity153 v. @entity5 ( 08 - 1332 )			0
also monday , the @entity14 , as expected , dismissed another challenge from several former @entity156 detainees over their claims of torture and religious discrimination			1
four @entity161 men , all @entity162 and onetime prisoners at the @entity165 military prison in @entity166 , had sued former defense secretary @entity167 and other top @entity169 officials , saying they knew of and condoned physical abuse and denial of rights guaranteed under international law			0
a federal appeals court had rejected a lawsuit -- the second one filed by the men -- saying the officials had immunity from such claims			1
but in june 2008 , the @entity14 allowed @entity156 prisoners to challenge their captivity in federal court , and a year ago , the justices urged the lower court to reconsider its decision against the @entity161 detainees			1
in the government filing this fall , solicitor general @entity186 told the high court to exercise caution in granting what she called " new rights " to detained foreign fighters suing for damages in a military setting			0
the high court , she noted , had previously told lower courts " to pay particular heed to any special factors counseling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation			0
" the prisoners alleged that their captors beat them , confined them in painful stress positions and used dogs to intimidate the @entity162 men during a period from 2002 - 04			0
they also claim being forced to shave their beards and being denied prayer mats and religious texts			0
one foreign fighter suspect also claimed that a military guard threw a copy of the @entity214 in a toilet , a major insult to the @entity218 faith			0
the case is @entity220 ( 09 - 227 ) .			0

@entity14 will hear two appeals regarding messages on government work devices
privacy dispute *centers* on police officer who sent " sexually explicit " messages on the job
police officer sued city and wireless company for invasion of privacy
justices also dismissed claims by former @entity156 detainees
