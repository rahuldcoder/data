-- commentators usually make too much of presidential debates			1
social science data consistently show that there are very few presidential debates that make a huge difference in the dynamics of a campaign -- other than a few exceptions where the race was incredibly narrow , as in 1960 or 2000 , and the performance of candidates had some impact			1
regardless of whether they are game - changers , the presidential debates are still an important part of the broader narrative about each candidate that voters evaluate when they step into the voting booth in november			1
more important than doing well is avoiding mistakes			1
particularly in the current age of @entity23 and nightly political news comedy , any slip - up can become fodder for the 24 - hour news cycle			2
the last thing that a candidate wants to do is provide material for the " @entity32 " comedy writers who are eagerly preparing for the next show			2
the mistakes the presidential candidates have made over the years are numerous			1
poor body language has been a common blunder			1
as much as candidates focus on perfecting the substance of what they say before the cameras , a large number of @entity38 are really most interested to see how they say it			2
in 1960 , the sweat on vice president @entity46 's brow , his pale skin , and his darting eyes conveyed the image of a politician who could not be fully trusted			2
debate coach : @entity52 , @entity53 are top performers in 1992 , president @entity56 's decision to glance at his watch while someone asked a question during a town hall meeting with @entity62 played into the image that he had little interest or patience with @entity38 struggling through the recession			1
vice president @entity68 's continual sighs during his 2000 debate against @entity70 conveyed a level of arrogance that made him more difficult to like			2
in another odd moment , @entity68 walked right up to @entity56 as he answered a question , looking like a schoolyard bully trying to stare down his opponent as he spoke			0
looks are important , but so are words			0
the way in which candidates package their ideas can matter very much			2
though there is always a temptation for candidates to prove that they know their stuff , sometimes too many words can be deadly			2
in 1980 , president @entity86 provided a lengthy and substantive response when asked about health insurance			0
@entity89 simply turned to him and said , " there you go again ! " @entity89 used just those few words to raise questions about whether @entity86 , with all his knowledge , really knew what he was talking about and whether he could be trusted			0
in 1984 , @entity89 's scattered response to a question , where he seemed to have trouble keeping his thoughts together and articulating an answer , raised questions about whether he was too old to be president			0
@entity89 recovered , however , turning the tables on his opponent , @entity104 , in the following debate , when he said , " i want you to know that also i will not make age an issue of this campaign			0
i am not going to exploit , for political purposes , my opponent 's youth and inexperience			0
" the manner in which candidates respond often tells voters a lot about the personality of a candidate			1
in 1988 , @entity121 gov. @entity120 answered with clinical detachment when @entity0 's @entity123 asked whether he would support the death penalty for someone who raped and killed his wife			0
" no , i do n't , @entity123 , and i think you know that i 've opposed the death penalty during all of my life			0
i do n't see any evidence that it 's a deterrent and i think there are more effective ways to deal with violent crime			0
" as he reiterated his opposition to the death penalty , @entity120 seemed to miss the fact that the panel wanted to see him wrestle with this difficult choice			0
the cold response conveyed the image of a politician who lacked warmth or passion			0
opinion : when candidates said ' no ' to debates verbal gaffes also have the capacity to turn a debate into a major campaign headache			1
before his 1976 debate against @entity86 , president @entity149 eagerly prepared to respond to criticism , coming from the right and the left , that his policy of detente with the @entity156 meant that he had essentially accepted the permanence of @entity158			0
when @entity159 responded to a question by saying that there was " no @entity156 domination of @entity163 , and there never will be under a @entity149 administration , " he meant to say that he did n't accept its legitimacy , nor did the people living under @entity170 rule			0
when questioned by a stunned reporter , @entity159 simply repeated his statement			0
not missing a beat , @entity86 pounced on the statement to raise questions about whether @entity159 was capable of handling the duties of the office			0
presidential debates are full of land mines for the candidates			1
even in an age where everything in politics is so scripted and overprepared , the televised debates remain an event where many mistakes are bound to be made			1
with the television cameras focused on everything the candidate does , and the political - analysis - industrial complex ready to pounced on every word and motion , president @entity52 and @entity53 , particularly with the race still so close , must enter with caution and be cognizant of how many of their predecessors have stumbled in this arena			1
for @entity52 , the challenge will be one of appearance , to convey the impression of strong leadership that his critics say he lacks and that independents are still trying to evaluate			1
for @entity53 , he 'll need to avoid the kinds of gaffes that have gotten him into repeated trouble and show , through his answers and demeanor , that he is not simply a creature of @entity38 's one percent			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 : top *priority* for candidates in debates is to avoid mistakes
he says gaffes have the *potential* to change how voters view a candidate
candidates are viewed not only for what they say but for their body language , he says
@entity214 : @entity52 , @entity53 will be under a *microscope* *wednesday* night when the debates begin
