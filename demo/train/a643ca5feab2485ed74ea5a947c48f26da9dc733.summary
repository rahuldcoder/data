@entity0 , @entity1 the embattled police here are testing something no other department in @entity7 has tried , in an effort to prevent another potentially explosive incident in which an officer kills an unarmed civilian			1
@entity0 police are evaluating a new attachment to their guns that could give a suspect a chance to live in an otherwise lethal encounter with police			1
this latest piece of weapons technology is called " @entity25 , " and it 's an orange - colored plastic device mounted on a gun barrel that turns the first fired bullet into a pingpong ball - sized projectile , designed not to kill			1
several officers have been trained on how to use it , but city officials have yet to decide on making the gear a requirement			0
" it 's something we 're testing for ourselves and seeing if this is even something feasible or reasonable to use for law enforcement officers , " mayor @entity31 told @entity2			2
the testing began just a week shy of the six - month anniversary of the killing of unarmed black teenager @entity40 by then - officer @entity41 , who is white and has since quit the force			2
the august police shooting sparked an intense , sometimes violent reaction from @entity0 residents , and demonstrations spread across the country			1
protesters condemned police tactics as brutal and excessive against minorities , citing other police killings of black men , often unarmed			2
the new gun technology is being evaluated as a remedy to the simmering tension between police and community members			1
local officials did n't want to speculate whether the device could have altered the outcome of the @entity63 encounter			2
@entity41 , who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing , told a grand jury that as he sat in his squad car , @entity40 , who was outside the vehicle , punched him in the face			0
@entity41 fired multiple shots at @entity40 , killing him			0
when the gun is fired , the bullet embeds in a golf ball - sized metal bulb , attached at the muzzle			1
the bullet fuses inside the metal sphere , and the unit morphs into a speeding ball			1
impact would be painful , but the projectile could be far less lethal than a naked bullet , the manufacturer said			1
getting hit could break bones and even kill			2
" it 's gon na feel like you had a professional baseball player hit you in the chest with a hammer , so it is going to hurt , " said @entity85 , the ceo of @entity86			1
" there is a possibility that this could kill you , but it is very slight when you compare that to a bullet			1
" his firm spent nine years developing the invention			0
" it was actually created by a retired sheriff officer			0
he did not like the fact that people were being shot when the officers do have time ( to consider options ) but they had no other option in lethal force , " @entity85 said			0
" so this product gives the officer another option in that scenario when it 's not reactive , and they do have the time to put it on , " he said , referring to mounting the device at the end of a gun barrel			1
the device , also called a docking unit , costs $ 45 and has a one - time use			1
it ejects itself from the muzzle after the police gun is fired			1
an officer can return to shooting again in a split second , and the bullets will be direct and unhampered			0
@entity85 describes the technology as one more tool for an officer 's belt			1
it provides an option that could spare the life of a threatening suspect			0
" it 's like an airbag for a bullet			2
so the risk is worth the reward to have an airbag in the car , and the risk is worth the reward if the officer can safely use our technology , " he said			2
the device is n't without controversy			0
it could put an officer 's life in danger , some retired law officers say			0
" our problem is not with the device , our problem is with the concept			0
this device ignores the human factor , " said @entity160 , a retired member of the @entity161 and a consultant on alternatives to lethal force			0
he pointed out that @entity25 would be used in situations that could escalate with little warning , forcing officers to make yet another decision in a critical moment their lives may be on the line			2
" when you 're under a lot of stress , you lose your fine motor skills and , as a result of that , pulling a trigger and thinking are far more complex than most people realize , " @entity160 said			0
@entity85 understands the reluctance on the part of some departments to test the new technology , but he noted how other former law enforcement personnel have been helping develop the device			2
@entity85 said the device is not for use when an officer must make a split - second decision , such as when a suspect pulls a gun			1
rather , it 's to be used when an officer has three or more seconds to decide			0
during that time , an officer can place the attachment on the gun while pointing it at a suspect			0
so far , @entity25 has never been tested on the human body , and it has not been used in real - life situations			1
@entity0 police have trained with the device on their shooting range , but it has n't been taken or used on the streets			1
mayor @entity31 emphasized how his city continues to evaluate the technology			0
" it has n't been used by anyone else , which is why we are doing all of our due diligence , making sure it 's properly tested , that it does not put anyone , especially our law enforcement , in any increased danger , and we 'll just make a decision based on that , " he said			0
@entity2 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0

device mounted on a gun barrel turns a bullet into a golf ball - sized projectile
@entity0 , @entity1 , police are evaluating the latest weapons technology called " @entity25 "
the projectile will still hurt and can even kill upon impact , but it 's designed to stop , not kill
