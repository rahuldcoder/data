@entity0 -- two @entity3 senators ratcheted up the pressure on @entity5 and @entity7 government officials monday to provide answers to the questions now swirling around the release of @entity11 , the @entity12 man convicted in the 1988 bombing of @entity14 , which killed 270 people			1
@entity17 administration officials , meanwhile , took what was described as an " exceptional step " to make clear that they had strongly opposed @entity11 's release			1
a group of senators from @entity0 and @entity23 have repeatedly voiced suspicions that @entity26 authorities released @entity11 as part of a deal allowing oil giant @entity5 to drill off the @entity12 coast			1
@entity5 , a @entity7 corporation , is already dealing with a public relations nightmare as the company responsible for the @entity33 oil disaster			1
@entity34 , @entity35 , is set to lead a @entity37 hearing thursday on the controversy surrounding @entity11 's release			1
several @entity7 officials have declined invitations to testify			2
" the abundance of incredible coincidences " surrounding @entity11 's release demands transparency , @entity34 said monday			1
" a cloud of suspicion " will hang over the issue until all of the relevant questions have been answered			0
@entity34 accused the @entity26 and @entity7 governments of trying to point the finger of blame at each other in the decision to release @entity11			1
they 're " playing a game of diplomatic tennis worthy of @entity55 , " he said			0
sen. @entity57 , @entity58 - @entity0 , said she is concerned that the release was " an example of profits being put above people			0
" the senators need to know if " blood was given for money , " she said			0
" we need to know that justice was served in this case			0
" the two senators were joined by relatives of three of the victims of the bombing			0
" the increasing silence " of authorities in @entity76 and @entity77 leads me to " think one thing : they 're guilty of something , " said @entity79 , who lost her father , brother and sister			0
@entity34 and @entity57 were part of a group of four senators who met for 45 minutes last week with prime minister @entity88 , asking the @entity7 leader for an independent investigation into the release of @entity11 and any possible involvement @entity5 might have had			1
sens. @entity93 of @entity0 and @entity94 of @entity23 also attended			0
most of the bombing victims were @entity3			0
the flight was headed from @entity98 , @entity99 , to @entity0 via @entity76 , @entity100 , when it exploded in the air			0
@entity11 was convicted in the case and sentenced to life in prison			2
the @entity26 government released him on compassionate grounds in august after doctors said he had terminal prostate cancer and just three months to live			2
@entity11 is still alive , however , and news reports in recent days have questioned whether he was as sick as depicted			2
under the @entity110 , @entity26 has its own government that is responsible for most of the day - to - day issues there , including the justice system			0
@entity34 has invited @entity26 justice secretary @entity115 , who made the decision to release @entity11 , to testify before the @entity37			1
@entity117 , the physician who gave the prognosis that led to @entity11 's release , and former @entity7 justice secretary @entity121 also have been asked to attend			1
in an effort to make clear that the @entity17 @entity123 had opposed the release @entity11 , the @entity125 on monday released the text of an august 12 , 2009 , letter sent from @entity128 , the number two official at the @entity129 in @entity7 , to @entity26 first minister @entity130			1
the letter stated that the @entity3 government " maintains its view that in light of the scope of @entity11 's crime , its heinous nature , and its continued and devastating impact on the victims and their families , it would be most appropriate for @entity11 to remain imprisoned for the entirety of his sentence			2
" if @entity11 were released from prison , the @entity3 would strongly oppose allowing him " to travel outside of @entity26 , " @entity128 wrote			2
" we believe that the welcoming reception that @entity11 might receive if he is permitted to travel abroad would be extremely inappropriate			0
" @entity125 spokesman @entity146 said monday that the administration was trying to " avoid the worst possible outcome -- a hero 's welcome for @entity11 in @entity12			2
... unfortunately , the @entity26 government did not heed those views			0
@entity26 authorities instead took two steps we explicitly asked them to avoid : they released @entity11 and they permitted his return to @entity12			2
" at a joint news conference last week , @entity88 and @entity3 president @entity17 blasted the @entity26 decision			0
@entity88 promised that the @entity7 government will cooperate with the @entity3 congressional investigation into the controversy , though he stressed that the decision to release @entity11 was made by the @entity26 government , without any involvement from @entity5			1
@entity17 said that most @entity3 were " surprised , disappointed and angry " about the decision to let @entity11 go			0
@entity5 has said it expressed concern to the @entity7 government in late 2007 about the slow progress of a prisoner transfer agreement that @entity7 and @entity12 were negotiating , saying it could have had a " negative impact " on @entity7 commercial interests			1
but the company has denied involvement in any talks with either the @entity7 or @entity26 governments specifically about @entity11 's release .			1
