-- following the liberal footsteps of @entity2 and @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and the @entity3 passed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this month			1
@entity9 's medical marijuana law failed , but only because as a constitutional amendment it needed 60 % support ; 58 % voted in favor of it			2
in 2016 , another five to 10 states will likely consider legalization -- possibly @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			0
opinion polls show that marijuana legalization now commands majority support across the country			2
do these developments mean that full legalization is inevitable ? not necessarily , but one would hope so			0
marijuana legalization is a policy no - brainer			2
any society that professes to value liberty should leave adults free to consume marijuana			0
moreover , the evidence from states and countries that have decriminalized or medicalized marijuana suggests that policy plays a modest role in limiting use			0
and while marijuana can harm the user or others when consumed inappropriately , the same applies to many legal goods such as alcohol , tobacco , excessive eating or driving a car			2
recent evidence from @entity2 confirms that marijuana 's legal status has minimal impact on marijuana use or the harms allegedly caused by use			1
since commercialization of medical marijuana in 2009 , and since legalization in 2012 , marijuana use , crime , traffic accidents , education and health outcomes have all followed their pre-existing trends rather than increasing or decreasing after policy liberalized			2
the strong claims made by legalization critics are not borne out in the data			0
likewise , some strong claims by legalization advocates -- e.g. , that marijuana tourism would be a major boom to the economy -- have also not materialized			2
the main impact of @entity2 's legalization has been that marijuana users can now purchase and use with less worry about harsh legal ramifications			1
yet despite the compelling case for legalization , and progress toward legalization at the state level , ultimate success is not assured			2
federal law still prohibits marijuana , and existing jurisprudence ( @entity95 2005 ) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition			1
so far , the federal government has mostly taken a hands - off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations , but in january 2017 , the country will have a new president			2
that person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law			1
whether that will happen is hard to forecast			0
if more states legalize marijuana and public opinion continues its support , @entity3 may hesitate to push back			1
but federal prohibition creates problems even if enforcement is nominal : marijuana business can not easily use standard financial institutions and transactions technologies such as credit cards ; physicians may still hesitate to prescribe marijuana ; and medical researchers will still face difficulty in studying marijuana			1
to realize the full potential of legalization , therefore , federal law must change			1
the best approach is to remove marijuana from the list of drugs regulated by the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) , the federal law that governs prohibition			1
standard regulatory and tax policies would still apply to legalized marijuana , and states would probably adopt marijuana - specific regulations similar to those for alcohol ( e.g. , minimum purchase ages )			1
state and federal governments might also impose " sin taxes , " as for alcohol			0
but otherwise marijuana would be just another commodity , as it was before the @entity148			0
a more cautious approach would have @entity150 reschedule marijuana under the @entity131			1
currently , marijuana is in @entity151 , which is reserved for drugs such as heroin and lsd that , according to the @entity131 , have " a high potential for abuse ... no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the @entity159 ... [ and ] a lack of accepted safety for use			1
" hardly anyone believes these conditions apply to marijuana			0
if marijuana were in @entity171 , which states it as " a high potential for abuse ... [ but a ] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the @entity159 , " doctors could legally prescribe it under federal law , as with other @entity166 drugs such as cocaine , methadone and morphine			1
given the broad range of conditions for which marijuana may be useful , including muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis , nausea from cancer chemotherapy , poor appetite and weight loss caused by chronic illness such as @entity190 , chronic pain , stress , seizure disorders and crohn 's disease , doctors would have wide reign to prescribe , making marijuana all but legal as occurs under the broadest state medical marijuana laws , such as @entity18 and @entity2			1
medical science would also face fewer regulatory hurdles to marijuana research			0
this " medicalization " approach , while perhaps politically more feasible than full legalization , has serious drawbacks			0
federal authorities such as the @entity203 could interfere with marijuana prescribing -- as sometimes occurs with opiate prescribing			0
taxing medical marijuana may be harder than taxing recreational marijuana			0
and the medical approach risks a charge of hypocrisy , since it is backdoor legalization			0
but medicalization is still better than full prohibition , since it eliminates the black market			0
for 77 years , the @entity159 has outlawed marijuana , with tragic repercussions and unintended consequences			1
the public and their state governments are on track to rectify this terrible policy			0
here 's hoping @entity150 catches up .			1

@entity4 , @entity5 and @entity3 recently legalized marijuana
@entity227 : state legalization is not enough ; what @entity159 needs is federal legalization
he says federal prohibition is a problem ; doctors and researchers are *afraid* to use it
@entity227 : given marijuana 's potential in medicine , @entity150 should make it legal
