-- according to a recent study by the @entity2 , about one in every four married or cohabitating @entity3 claim they 're so sleep - deprived that they 're often too tired to have sex			1
it 's not surprising why sleep trumps sex : between work , family and social obligations , our need for shuteye often suffers			1
add in problems such as financial stress , health issues and relationship woes , and you can see why sex tends to drop to the bottom of our " to do " list -- if it 's on there at all			1
and when we do finally hit the sheets , many of us are more apt to hold onto our smart phone , tablet or other gadget than our partner 's hand			1
" many of us are multitasking throughout the day for extended periods of time -- constant stimulation that can allow for enriching experiences , " says @entity32 , sex coach and founder of @entity34			0
" however , that can also take its toll on our sex lives			0
" in some cases , though , simple exhaustion is n't the only reason why sex takes a backseat to sleep			1
unless you 've been diagnosed with a health condition that saps energy , such as chronic fatigue syndrome , it 's possible that factors other than a busy lifestyle are at play			0
are men ' sexually fluid ? ' " boredom could be to blame , " @entity58 says			1
" if you think or feel sex is going to be status quo , it will feel like a chore rather than something that 's satisfying			1
" also likely : a low sex drive			1
according to a 2008 study published in the @entity68 , between one - third and one - half of all women will find themselves coping with low sexual desire at some point in their lives			1
and while we 're lacking such strong statistics for men , i and many other experts believe that low libido is increasingly becoming a problem for guys , too			1
although any number of factors could be to blame for these dips in desire , many of the same triggers that make us exhausted -- like stress , anxiety , worry -- are also linked to decreased desire in both men and women			0
some people may confuse a low libido with being too tired for sex ; for others , exhaustion itself seems to trigger a lower sex drive			1
" a lot of women are satisfied with their relationships and enjoy sex once it 's under way but are just too tired and stressed to feel sexual desire , " explains @entity103 , a @entity104 professor of psychology and the author of " a tired woman 's guide to passionate @entity109			1
" the book was shown in a published study of 45 women to significantly increase sexual desire , arousal , satisfaction and overall sexual functioning in those who followed the book 's program			1
fortunately , there 's much you can do to create both the time and energy to make sex a regular part of your routine again			1
try these steps to get back on track : get on a regular sleep schedule it 's the end of a long day , the kids are finally in bed , and all you and your partner want to do is -- well , veg out in front of the tv , or putter around on the @entity143 , or play a few rounds of @entity145			1
says @entity146 , educator and founder of @entity148 , " the average @entity3 spends 2.7 hours a day watching tv , according to the @entity150			2
so you have to ask yourself which is more important to you : your relationship or @entity153 ? " try to stick to a regular bedtime , and devote the last hour or so of your waking time to your partner			2
even if you do nothing more than cuddle , you 're setting a schedule that allows time for more when you 're ready			2
eventually , your mood will follow			0
stay - at - home dads are sexy think outside the box it 's easy to say , " let 's have sex tonight , " early in the day when your energy is still high			2
yet most of us wait until nighttime to get intimate , and by then we 're often too tired to make a move			2
" some people are more aroused during the day than at night , " @entity58 says			0
" make your arousal pattern work with your schedule and that of your partner so you can enjoy physical intimacy			2
" that might mean indulging in morning sex before work or a lunchtime quickie -- whatever works for you			0
make a date think scheduled sex is boring ? not necessarily			2
there 's a common assumption that spontaneous sex is best , but " planned encounters help build anticipation and relieve tension within your relationship , " @entity184 says			2
get a sitter and head out for date night , play hooky from work , or make time for sex when the kids are at a friend 's house , for example			1
adds @entity146 , " scheduling sex is great for someone who loves to make a ' to - do ' list			0
you know you 're not going to sleep until that box is checked off			2
plus , it 'll establish a pattern of healthy sexual behavior			0
they say it takes 21 days to form a habit			0
once that habit is formed , you wo n't want to go to sleep unless you 've had sex			0
" just do it it can be tough to feel aroused when all you want to do it sleep			0
like other forms of exercise , " sex can give you an energetic buzz , " @entity58 says			0
" you just have to be willing to push past the feeling of tiredness to experience the pleasure that will ultimately recharge you			0
" if you shift your schedule so you get enough sleep and reprioritize your day to the essentials , " @entity58 says , " being tired does n't have to be a factor that influences your sex life			1
" and remember , sex begets sex			0
once you get back into the swing of things , you 're likely to start wanting to get -- and stay -- intimate more often			0
when you wake up and smell the coffee , it will smell all the better for having had sex the night before			0
