a massive cleanup effort was underway early sunday at an @entity2 park where hours earlier @entity4 riot police cleared protesters camped out in what has become ground zero in anti-government demonstrations targeting the policies of prime minister @entity10			1
at least 29 people were injured in clashes saturday as police sealed off @entity14 and took @entity15 , @entity2 gov. @entity16 said in remarks carried on @entity4 television stations			1
police pushed protesters onto side streets , where on one street many -- with their faces covered with masks because of tear gas and smoke -- appeared to reorganize			1
chanting " long live @entity14 solidarity , " the demonstrators began moving back toward the square and park			2
in turn , authorities fired tear gas and a water cannon down the street to try to disperse them			1
the move came after police warned demonstrators who have occupied @entity2 's last remaining green space for more than two weeks to depart voluntarily or face being ejected			1
by early sunday morning , most protesters had dispersed and the cleanup was underway , according to @entity43 's @entity42 , who was reporting in the area			1
calls for political reforms the protest that began over @entity10 's plan to turn the park into a mall quickly devolved into large anti-government demonstrations that have seen calls for political reforms			1
what 's driving unrest and protests in @entity4 ? @entity10 , who has been defiant of protest demands , said earlier in the day at a rally with supporters in @entity59 that if protesters did not leave on their own , they would be forced out of @entity15			1
" if it is not emptied , from now on , this country 's security forces will know how to empty that place , " he said			2
a few minutes later , police used loudspeakers to order the protesters out of the park , saying it was their last warning			2
but the demonstration continued as the sun began to set , with hundreds of people packing the square , some of them wearing gas masks , others linking arms in solidarity and anticipation			1
during his speech , @entity10 said the demonstrators were not meeting him halfway			1
" we have reached out with our hands , " he said			2
" however , some people returned their fists in response			2
can you shake hands with those who reach out with a fist ? " and he ridiculed the protesters ' assertions that they are environmentalists , calling them " thugs " instead , and citing their honking of horns as evidence of their insincerity			1
" this is called noise pollution , " he said			0
a dozen of his @entity102 buildings have been damaged and burned , he said , accusing " outsiders " of staging the demonstrations			0
he accused demonstrators of inciting sectarian violence by attacking a woman who was wearing a headscarf , kicking her , dragging her on the ground and snatching away her head cover			2
he accused some demonstrators of having entered a mosque while wearing shoes , drunk alcohol there and written insulting slogans on the walls -- acts forbidden by @entity120 -- but said authorities had been patient			0
@entity10 said the courts will handle such incidents			2
letters from @entity4 , with pride he said he did not understand the concerns about the park , since no contracts have been signed and no construction has begun			0
" there is nothing yet to protest , " he said			0
' every kind of hypocrisy ' @entity10 accused social media for spreading misinformation , the national media of lying and the international media of displaying " every kind of hypocrisy " in its reporting , but he expressed gratitude for the crowd 's support			1
he praised his government 's performance over the past 10 years , citing a rising standard of living , a stock market that has broken records , a quintupling of the central bank 's reserves , plans to build the world 's biggest airport and the construction of a third bridge scheduled to begin carrying traffic in four lanes in either direction over the @entity160 in 2015			0
@entity10 said maintaining the park as a green space was not the real goal of most of the demonstrators , four of whom have been arrested			1
" what is the issue then ? " he asked			0
" it is to take down the @entity102 government			0
" except for a few who are genuinely concerned about the environment , the demonstrators are upset about @entity4 's growing strength , he said , adding that more than 600 of his police had been wounded in the clashes			1
" no one can scare us off , " he said			0
@entity10 delivered his message to a supportive crowd , amid a carnival atmosphere and heavy police security			1
during his comments , some of his supporters waved the red - and - white @entity4 flag as well as the orange , white and blue flag of @entity10 's @entity102			1
the festive mood contrasted sharply with the scene here overnight , when @entity4 riot police sprayed rowdy anti-government demonstrators with water cannon and fired tear gas at them , arresting nearly a dozen people in the third consecutive night of clashes in the capital			1
@entity10 vs. protesters the unrest began nearly 500 kilometers ( 311 miles ) away , in @entity2 , nearly three weeks ago , when a small group of people turned out to protest government plans to bulldoze the city 's @entity15 and to replace it with a shopping mall housed inside a replica of a 19th - century @entity205 barracks			1
protesters said the plans represented a creeping infringement on their rights in a secular society			0
@entity4 was founded after secularists in the early 20th century defeated @entity120 @entity205 forces , and many modern - day secularists frown on @entity205 symbols			0
the protests broadened into an outpouring in the square and throughout the country as security forces cracked down on demonstrators			0
the images , seen worldwide on social media and tv , sparked criticism around the world as well as in @entity4 , a @entity227 member and a @entity229 ally			0
the unrest also signaled political danger for @entity10 , a populist and democratically elected politician serving his third term in office			2
@entity10 has been criticized -- even by his allies -- for using heavy - handed tactics in his governance and for trying to impose changes without first seeking public input			2
the park plan represented the final straw for many @entity4 , who accuse the government of trying to impose its will whenever and wherever it wants			0
on friday , @entity10 met with protesters in @entity59 and then said he would suspend plans to build the mall in @entity2 pending a court decision on the protesters ' objections to its construction			1
if the judicial ruling is not in line with what gezi protesters want , a popular vote will be held			0
@entity10 also agreed to investigate claims of excessive use of force by police during the protests , some of which have turned violent			1
@entity266 , a city planner speaking on behalf of the @entity268 protest movement , thanked @entity10 and his ministers for accepting their demands for a meeting			2
" we will closely follow his promises and the process			0
unfortunately , four people died in the incidents			0
we still feel the pain of their death			0
" despite conciliatory statements from both sides , protesters defied the pleas of their prime minister and remained encamped saturday in the park where the demonstrations started 19 days ago			0
