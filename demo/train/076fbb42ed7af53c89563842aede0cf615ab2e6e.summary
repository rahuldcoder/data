-- as president @entity3 's second - term @entity2 starts to take shape , we can see some of the outlines of what the @entity6 hopes to do in the next four years			1
the major theme is that @entity3 is prepared to defend his turf , tooth and nail			1
this is a cabinet whose strength is defense rather than offense			0
gone are the hopes of bipartisanship			1
now it 's time to really engage the partisan battle			1
@entity3 wo n't be pushing for many watershed changes in the next four years , but he is not going to make it easy for @entity22 to make any deep inroads into what he has accomplished			1
during the last two weeks , the president rolled out his nominations on national security -- sen. @entity29 for secretary of state , sen. @entity30 for secretary of defense , and @entity32 to direct the @entity33			1
he then nominated his chief of staff , @entity34 , to be secretary of the treasury			1
we must be careful not to infer too much from presidential appointments , since these people ultimately serve the interests of the president rather than vice versa -- but still , the identities of the members of the new @entity2 provide important hints			2
this is a team with experience and deep roots in @entity48			2
it is clear that @entity3 , sobered after four brutal years of fighting with @entity22 in @entity51 , realizes that he needs leaders who have clout in @entity51			2
on national security , this is a team with deep experience that can protect the existing policies the administration has adopted			0
@entity3 has selected two @entity60 veterans who are also military veterans , @entity29 and @entity61 , with the hope of using their connections with legislators and their knowledge of the ways and means of the legislative process			1
though @entity32 does n't come from the @entity60 , he is a veteran in national security circles , having worked at the highest levels of intelligence since the 1990s , and someone who @entity3 clearly feels will be effective in protecting his institutional turf should the legislative waters get rough			1
the nominations also send the signal that @entity3 will continue to emphasize the kind of pragmatic hawkish agenda that he has embraced from the start of his presidency			2
since 2009 , @entity3 has generally lived within the policy framework that he inherited from president @entity81			1
he has kept the national security infrastructure in place , followed through with @entity81 's plans on @entity85 and @entity86 ( withdrawing in the first case and increasing troops , then diminishing @entity90 presence in the second case ) , and strategically employed aggressive military power such as drone strikes and assassinations against the leadership of @entity96			0
none of his appointees is a dove			0
@entity29 has frequently authorized the use of military force , including against @entity85			2
@entity61 is a solid @entity22 who supports using troops when necessary			2
@entity32 withdrew his name from consideration for the @entity33 in the first term because of statements he made in support of " enhanced interrogation techniques " against detainees			2
in 2007 , @entity32 had said : " there have been a lot of information that has come out from these interrogation procedures that the agency has in fact used against the real hard - core terrorists			2
" what the three men have in common is not a predilection to being doves but a belief that force should be employed only when absolutely essential and that war must be a tool of last resort			0
this is a vision of internationalism that has guided @entity90 policy for much of the period since @entity131 both @entity29 and @entity61 are combat veterans who have seen the costs of war firsthand , and they thus remain more squeamish about making mistakes than many of the civilian leaders who have sent troops into harm 's way			1
with continued tensions involving countries like @entity144 and @entity145 , this outlook will be an essential brake if pressure to go to war intensifies			0
for all the alleged controversy over the nominations , what is notable about all three is how they are basically supportive of what @entity3 has done in his first four years and , just as important , much of what @entity81 did during his time in office -- outside of going to war in @entity85			0
although foreign policy is always hard to predict , since it depends on what others do to us as much as what we decide , this is a @entity2 that signals continuity rather than dramatic change			0
at @entity166 , the choice of @entity34 sends a slightly different signal			0
as with the national security nominations , @entity34 is someone with a deep record of experience in @entity48 , having served in many roles in the executive and legislative branches since the 1970s			1
his appointment shows a shift in concern from banking to budgets			0
in certain respects , the choice of @entity34 , a veteran of budget wars since the 1990s , signals @entity3 's preparedness to fight @entity22 over spending cuts and the debt ceiling , putting into high office one of his most effective and wily negotiators			1
but @entity34 is also a progressive , someone who believes deeply that the wealthy should pay their fair share of taxes and that @entity189 and @entity190 must be protected			0
this will be one of the biggest issues at the center of the upcoming budget wars , and by selecting @entity34 for this job , @entity3 is sending a clear signal that he does not plan to give ground easily on these programs in the months ahead			1
people who were still hoping for big changes on national security or domestic policy are going to be disappointed			0
at this point , it 's too early to tell what the appointments say about new initiatives that the administration might pursue , such as immigration reform			0
but we do know that the president is not planning to give much ground on the programs that are in place			0
these nominations suggest that the administration is gearing up to fight to defend national security and the major social programs from budget cuts rather than really pushing through big reforms			0
at the same time , @entity3 has selected some of the toughest fighters in @entity48 , suggesting that if @entity22 want big change , they are going to have to mount a pretty heroic effort to get it done			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0

@entity228 : @entity3 's cabinet appointments suggest he 's preparing to battle
he says the president *picked* tough , wily veterans of @entity48
@entity228 : @entity29 , @entity61 , @entity32 , @entity34 are committed to @entity3 's policies
he says hopes for bipartisanship are gone ; now it 's partisan warfare
