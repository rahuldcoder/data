-- @entity1 has talked of ripping out the @entity2 bowling alley and replacing it with a basketball court			1
the former reserve player for @entity7 's 1979 state championship team brings an enthusiasm for pickup basketball games to a place where golf , baseball and football have been the most - discussed sports			1
@entity15 says he 'd pick @entity1 for his squad because he likes the president - elect 's team approach			1
and if he puts hoops in the @entity2 , @entity15 , the retired basketball star and sports broadcaster , wants in			1
" i would love to be the first to go there and play , " said @entity15 , whose record - breaking 2,560 three - pointers with the @entity22 electrified basketball fans			1
@entity25 , 43 , is an @entity26 analyst for @entity27 , which is owned by @entity28 , parent company of @entity0			0
@entity15 and others have said @entity1 's playing style yields clues to the type of president he will be			1
@entity15 , who said he backed @entity1 in the election , spoke monday to @entity0			1
ireport.com : what would you like to ask @entity1 ? @entity0 : do you know @entity1 ? @entity15 : i have never met him personally , but from afar , obviously i admire the man and the courage and the strength , the wisdom			1
i respect how much of a family man he is			0
@entity0 : where does basketball fit in your view of @entity1 ? @entity15 : it seems like he has a regular pickup game , which i like because as a ballplayer , you like to do the same routine			1
... he plays with the same guys , he likes to get a good sweat in			2
... when you get a good workout in , you feel good for the rest of the day			2
it helps clear the mind			0
@entity0 : he 's a left - hander ; he likes to fake right and go to the left ? @entity15 : i 've seen clips of his @entity7 [ high school ] days , when he played in @entity67 , and i saw that @entity69 special with @entity70 when they had that informal game			1
... he is a point guard , and most point guards are right - handed , so it would be definitely be difficult to guard a point guard that was left - handed			0
and in that [ @entity69 ] clip , i loved his decision - making , because it looked like he tried to get everyone involved , until it was game point and it was tied up			0
obviously , the commander in chief decides the game [ @entity1 made the winning shot ] , and i like it			1
i think that trickles down into , you let your colonels , your generals do all the little work , but when it 's time to make the big decision and win the game -- then it 's the commander in chief , top dog , numero uno			2
but i will say this , if i was playing against him in a pickup game , i would definitely force him right because it looks like he loves to go left			0
@entity0 : does he remind you of anyone you played against ? @entity15 : well , it 's funny because you do n't play against a lot of left - handed point guards			1
@entity105 of the @entity106 , a left - handed point guard from @entity107			0
... [ @entity109 ] " @entity108 , i believe he was left - handed as well			0
@entity0 : from what you 've seen , how good a player is @entity1 ? @entity15 : i would not mind picking him up on my squad ; if there were 10 guys and we had to pick , he could definitely be in my squad			1
because he knows what his strength is -- making sure that everyone gets involved , and that 's the kind of point guard i want			2
those are guys like @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , it 's not all about them ; it 's about let 's make sure our team is good			1
he 's going to get the ball to everyone			2
@entity0 : speaking of being commander in chief , what are the lessons that you take away from @entity1 's basketball that you think would be useful ? @entity15 : if you look at his demeanor , he 's very cool ; you have to be cool under pressure			1
you ca n't make hasty decisions			0
you 've got to look at the full picture as a whole and then you assess it			0
and i think from a strategic and a political standpoint , i think that very much sums up mr. @entity1			2
you look at him during the debate and during the campaign , he pretty much never got too high and never got too low ; he just kind of stayed right in the middle			0
when you 're making the decisions that he 's going to be making , for our economy , for @entity154 , @entity155 , you want someone who 's levelheaded who 's going to look at the big picture , who 's going to rely on his @entity160 , which would be the other players			2
you want them to all be on same page , which you want your starting five to be , and then you go out there and execute it			0
@entity0 : you think he 's going to have an impact on the sport of basketball by example ? @entity15 : it 's not just basketball , i think sports in general			1
you know he 's already said yes , " i think we should have a @entity176 " [ playoff system for deciding the nation 's college football championship ] , and i think everyone agrees with him			2
i think his love of basketball is only going to help the high school , collegiate and professional ranks			0
... for sports in general , it 's good to have a person in the @entity2 who 's physically fit , who loves sports but also understands and knows how to run a country			1
@entity0 : in that order ? @entity15 : i do n't know about that order			2
i think i would probably start with running the country first			0
i think what we do is more entertainment and letting people escape			0
i think running the country is a little more important than worrying about the @entity176 title game			0
i think getting jobs is probably first and foremost and getting our economy straight and getting our troops home , i think those are the most important things for the president - elect			0
but if he does find time to get a @entity176 playoff , that would be nice .			0

@entity15 : @entity1 's basketball style offers clues to his *leadership*
he says @entity1 tries to involve the whole team but also will take final shot
@entity15 : @entity1 's interest in sports and fitness is a good example for the @entity221
