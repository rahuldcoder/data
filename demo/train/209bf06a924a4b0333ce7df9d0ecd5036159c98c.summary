would you enjoy social media more without all those pesky 99 - percenters complaining about their mortgage payments and high cable bills ? for a mere $ 9,000 , @entity5 is here to help			1
launched tuesday , @entity5 bills itself as " the online country club for people with more money than time			1
to join , users must pony up $ 9,000 for dues and a membership fee , then another $ 3,000 per year after that			1

" this is 100 % real , and i believe there is a need and an audience for this service , " said @entity24 , @entity5 's founder			1
@entity24 , 48 , a composer and former conductor of the @entity30 , said he had trouble finding people to whom he could relate on other social sites			1
