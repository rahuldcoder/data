a country is suffering from a deep recession , unemployment is increasing , and the government deficit looms larger by the day			2
part of the problem comes from an overvalued , fixed exchange rate			1
anti-government demonstrations are a common occurrence , and riots are increasingly frequent			0
the country seems engulfed by a rising wave of chaos			0
the @entity13 is administering an aid package			2
the government is duly passing austerity package after austerity package , at the behest of foreign creditors , while ignoring the population 's wishes and representatives			0
the country in question ? @entity25 in 2011 ? no , it 's @entity27 in 2001			1
while not every part of the puzzle falls into place , many of the similarities are striking			0
it all started so well			0
for a while , after @entity27 introduced a currency board -- a rigid link with the @entity37 - dollar -- inflation came down , and consumption and growth surged			1
asset prices ballooned , wages went up , and the new prosperity was everywhere -- in swanky restaurants , in the form of gleaming new cars , and in massive public building projects			0
then , suddenly , the dream fell apart overnight			0
in @entity25 , joining the euro -- effectively a way of fixing @entity25 's exchange rate vis - Ã  - vis its @entity53 partners -- also caused a drastic reduction in inflationary expectations			1
lower interest rates fueled a consumption and housing binge ; growth looked good for a few years , and so did tax receipts			0
everyone was spending : firms , consumers and the government			0
in both cases , the rigid exchange rate went hand - in - hand with a dramatic loss in competitiveness			1
both @entity27 and @entity25 continued to import much more than they exported ; for a while , the high life continued , fueled by foreign borrowing that paid for the gap			1
in both @entity25 and @entity27 , there were fudged numbers in the public accounts			1
while the @entity25 case is well known , @entity27 's debt / gdp ratio increased by more than 10 % in four years , from 1994 to 1998			1
at the same time , official central government accounts showed deficits of 1.7 % to 2.2 % -- in an economy that was growing by up to 8 % per year , the debt / gdp ratio should actually have been falling			0
in both cases , the ability to raise taxes was very small , with the government raising no more than 20 % -30 % of gdp			0
when the crisis came , with interest rates moving up sharply in the secondary market for government bonds , the first reaction was denial ; then a wave of austerity measures			0
@entity27 brought back @entity97 , the architect of its @entity99 - like escape from hyperinflation half a decade earlier			2
the @entity25 voted in a new , reforming government under @entity102 , which promptly found so many skeletons in the cupboard that it had to go cap in hand to its @entity53 partners soon after			2
in both cases , the @entity13 ( in the @entity25 case , together with the @entity110 ) kept on lending long after it became clear that the country was insolvent			1
the political pressure was just too great not to do so ; until the end , lenders hoped that the risk premium might one day start to fall , and that a combination of austerity and cheap loans from international institutions would make the problem go away			0
the increasingly hectic political moves over the last week in @entity25 are also reminding many veterans of emerging market crises of the @entity27 case			1
the @entity25 government will surely fall if it loses the referendum ; @entity27 's cabinet became a revolving door for ministers before finally defaulting in chaotic fashion			1
@entity25 shows that all of the eurozone is now potentially subject to wrenching debt crises of the type that were once the prerogative of emerging markets			2
the cause of the problem is often similar -- a pegged exchange rate at an artificial rate , combined with massive debts issued in a foreign currency			1
once the peg failed , @entity27 's banking system imploded ; @entity27 could not touch their savings for years , and the economy collapsed , before rebounding sharply			1
for the @entity150 by the @entity151 , a commodity boom eventually helped to turn the economy around			0
no similar positive shock from foreign demand is going to save the @entity25 -- they simply do not produce enough of a range of goods to benefit			2
whether @entity25 can avoid the wholesale destruction of its banking system is unclear , especially if a " no " vote arrives			1
perhaps @entity102 should make sure there is a helicopter on standby , to rescue him from the presidential palace should he be forced to flee from angry protesters -- as @entity27 president @entity166 was in december 2001 .			2

@entity168 *believes* @entity25 in 2011 is similar to @entity27 in 2001
in both cases , the exchange rate went hand - in - hand with lost competitiveness
the @entity13 continued lending long after it became clear that each country was insolvent
whether @entity25 can avoid the wholesale destruction of its banking system is unclear
