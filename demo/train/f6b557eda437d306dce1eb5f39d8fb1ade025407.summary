@entity0 -- when president @entity3 steps in front of cameras wednesday , he 'll be addressing a nation that 's simultaneously war - weary and ready for more military action against @entity8 ; critical of @entity3 's handling of the crisis yet largely supportive of his commitment to keep combat troops out			1
those currents of public opinion , however convoluted , will shape how @entity3 frames his strategy for " degrading and ultimately defeating " the @entity18 militants in @entity19 and @entity20 , which @entity21 now believe pose a real threat and must be combated			1
here 's what the polling suggests @entity21 are listening for when @entity3 speaks wednesday : what 's your plan ? when @entity3 admitted to reporters his administration lacked a strategy for combating @entity8 in @entity20 , @entity21 largely agreed with him			1
more than two - thirds said in @entity1 's most recent survey the president lacked a clear plan for dealing with the militant jihadists			1
countering that perception will be @entity3 's main challenge on wednesday , and aides say he 'll point to both the ongoing @entity21 effort in @entity19 and new efforts to train and equip local forces as evidence of a clear plot to go after the terrorists			1
he 's open to airstrikes in @entity20 , officials say , and wants a broad coalition of allied countries to back him up			2
that puts him in agreement with the nearly three quarters of @entity21 who say they 're ready for a broader air campaign to defeat isis in @entity19 and @entity20			1
certain specifics of the @entity3 plan , however , may be hard to come by -- on tuesday , the @entity54 said @entity3 would offer neither a timeline for his strategy in defeating @entity8 nor a price tag			2
" i would n't expect something that 's quite that detailed , " press secretary @entity60 said			0
" but the president is very interested in communicating clearly with the @entity21 public about what our priorities are and what our plans include			1
" analysts say whatever strategy @entity3 announces -- be it airstrikes , broader training , or both -- must have a clearly articulated goal			0
" the biggest mistake would be not presenting a strategy that 's decisive , " said retired @entity76 commander @entity75			0
" i think he has to clearly lay out what the objectives are			0
if it 's the destruction of @entity8 , that has significant meaning			0
" @entity3 : @entity21 to " start going on some offense " is @entity8 a threat in the @entity21 ? @entity21 are worried about @entity8 -- two - thirds told @entity1 in a poll the group posed a very or fairly serious threat			1
the @entity54 agrees , saying the @entity91 militants could threaten " core @entity21 interests			0
" but as recently as tuesday , the @entity54 maintained @entity8 had no current plans to attack the @entity21 at home			2
" there is no evidence to indicate that @entity8 right now is actively plotting to hit the homeland , " @entity60 said , using the administration 's name for the terror group			0
" it is important for people to understand that			0
" so without a specific looming threat , @entity21 will want to hear the president 's reasoning for ramping up @entity21 military effort against the group -- particularly after the rhetoric used to begin the last war in @entity19 turned out to be false			1
a majority of @entity21 do say they were upset by the @entity8 beheadings of @entity21 journalists @entity113 and @entity115 , and @entity3 has warned of @entity117 - born foreign fighters who have the potential to return to the @entity21 to stage terror plots			1
the timing of the speech -- on the eve of the september 11 attack anniversary -- will only serve to remind @entity21 of how terrorism can hit at home , even as federal officials maintain there 's no current risk of attacks from @entity8			2
and while terrorism still ranks well below the economy as the issue most important to @entity21 , it is rising in standing			0
just two years ago only 3 % of @entity21 said it was their top issue ; now 14 % say it 's what they care most about			2
analysis : @entity8 threat to @entity21 mostly ' hype ' why not have @entity141 approve ? when @entity3 was last considering airstrikes in @entity20 -- one year ago following president @entity145 's use of chemical weapons on civilians -- he scrapped his plans when it became clear @entity141 was n't on board			1
this time around things are different			0
any action @entity3 announces wednesday night wo n't require authorization from @entity141 , the @entity54 announced , though they 're still looking for support from lawmakers			1
the past 12 months in @entity20 have created a new dynamic			0
it 's now clear @entity145 is n't leaving power , having turned over his chemical weapons to international control			0
the terror groups that @entity3 predicted would gain a foothold in @entity20 have			1
and @entity141 is now closer to midterm elections in which a vote for broad military power could be politically harmful			2
that means the president will use his existing powers to go after the jihadist group which now controls land spanning the border between @entity19 and @entity20			1
the current air campaign in @entity19 relies on @entity3 's ability to order strikes that protect @entity21 interests and help alleviate potential humanitarian crises			1
airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity20 , an option @entity3 is open to , would require those parameters to be broadened -- and that will require some explaining to the @entity21 people			1
@entity1 's poll showed a large majority -- 72 % of @entity21 -- want @entity141 to sign off on new military force against @entity8			1
but even some lawmakers themselves are n't so sure			0
the top democrats in @entity141 -- senate majority leader @entity189 and @entity191 @entity190 -- both said they agreed with the @entity54 decision to forgo @entity141 approval			0
related : @entity194 finds most @entity21 alarmed by @entity8 are @entity21 troops heading in ? the short answer is no. @entity3 , having been elected to office partly on his pledge to draw down the @entity21 combat missions in @entity19 and @entity200 , has adamantly maintained he wo n't be sending @entity21 troops back into war			1
" you also can not , over the long term or even the medium term , deal with this problem by having the @entity21 serially occupy various countries all around the @entity208			2
we do n't have the resources			0
it puts enormous strains on our military			0
and at some point , we leave			0
and then things blow up again , " he told @entity216 last week			0
" we 've got to have a more sustainable strategy , which means the boots on the ground have to be @entity19			2
... and in @entity20 , the boots on the ground have to be @entity20			2
" but there is an asterisk			0
a few hundred @entity21 troops are on the ground in @entity19 to advise and help the military there			1
such cooperation would be extremely difficult in @entity20 , where the president called long ago for the ouster of president @entity145 .			0

president @entity3 will lay out his plan to deal with isis in @entity19 and @entity20
@entity1 's poll suggests @entity21 are alarmed at the *prospect* of a terror attack
but the public does not support putting @entity21 troops on the ground
it is unlikely @entity141 will need to vote to authorize military action
