the overthrow of @entity1 has had a messy and often confused aftermath , as rival groups jostle for a stake in the new @entity5 after four decades of dictatorship			1
but while the realities of @entity5 's new order remain murky , for the country 's @entity9 minority , the task ahead is clear			1
the removal of the old regime has cleared the way for a renaissance of their ancient language and culture that were brutally suppressed under @entity1 's hardline rule			1
known in their native tongue as @entity23 , or " free man , " the @entity21 are the indigenous inhabitants of @entity26 , whose culture predominated in the region prior to the 7th century @entity30 invasion			1
but @entity1 's ideology stressed the unity of all @entity33 under an @entity30 identity , and any efforts at @entity23 cultural expression during his rule were effectively forbidden			1
those among the country 's @entity9 minority -- there is no reliable census data , but most estimates place it at about 10 % of the population -- who attempted to promote their rights or cultural heritage would find themselves persecuted , sometimes even killed			1
berbers were unable to publicly speak or publish books in their language , @entity9 , or display symbols such as the @entity23 flag			1
" you could n't teach it in schools , you did n't have university departments for @entity23 research , or have @entity23 tv stations or radio , " said @entity54 , a @entity55 - based @entity9 activist			1
" even children 's names -- there was a law which banned any names that were not arabic or @entity68			2
they ( the @entity1 regime ) forced you to change your child 's name			2
" @entity54 has personally felt the brunt of the regime 's hostility to @entity9 culture			1
in december 2010 , prior to the revolution , he and his twin brother were arrested in their @entity55 home , on suspicion of " working and collaborating with foreign intelligence			0
" their real crime , according to @entity54 and @entity85 , was advocating for @entity9 cultural rights , evidence of which was found by police in the form of banned @entity23 texts , smuggled from abroad , in their home			2

a riot erupted at the prison and , along with other prisoners , the brothers escaped			0
" we were very lucky , " said @entity54			0
having escaped from prison , @entity54 headed for the @entity106 , a traditional @entity23 stronghold where the @entity9 population would become heavily engaged in fighting with @entity1 's forces , gaining the upper hand more swiftly than their counterparts in the east of the country			1
@entity54 started a media communications center , and set about producing the first ever journal published in @entity9			2
initially a crudely produced newsletter , printed on sheets of @entity118 , " @entity119 " ( " freedom " in @entity9 ) became a more professional publication when @entity54 relocated to the capital following the fall of @entity55			0
written in @entity9 , @entity125 and @entity126 , it has a print run of 3,000 , and a focus on promoting @entity23 culture and language , by reprinting ancient works of poetry , as well as more modern works by writers such as @entity135			1
" @entity119 " is just one element of the flowering of @entity23 culture to have taken place in the wake of @entity1 's downfall			1
tamazight is being taught by cultural associations , can be heard on radio stations , and read on signs written in the @entity147 alphabet at shops and other public places			0
the @entity9 flag -- comprised of blue , green and yellow horizontal stripes , superimposed with a red @entity147 character symbolizing a " free man " -- is displayed proudly , and @entity23 music is performed at festivals around the country			2
" after 40 years of having a complete lack of this kind of expression , there 's a real enthusiasm for it , " said @entity157 , @entity85 's @entity26 researcher			0
" what we see is the @entity23 gathering together and celebrating their culture , having various festivals , making links between towns			2
they 're filling up the space they were denied for several decades			0
" but despite their new - found freedom of cultural expression , some @entity9 activists remain anxious about their community 's position in the new @entity5			1
when an interim government was announced in november without a single @entity23 minister , @entity21 reacted with disappointment			0
fearing their community was being marginalized , a group calling itself the @entity184 announced it was suspending all relations with the @entity186 ( @entity186 )			0

" they used us to progress and make a progress in advance to get @entity5 liberated , " @entity54 said			0
" but once things were liberated , the message has been : ' thank you so much , we used you and that 's it			0
' to us , it 's like a betrayal by the @entity186			0
" in this climate , some @entity21 fear their cultural rights may not receive the constitutional protections they seek			0
@entity5 's interim " constitutional declaration , " drawn up by the @entity186 to provide a framework for the transition to an elected government , pledged that the state would protect the linguistic and cultural rights of " all components " of @entity33 society			1
but while upholding @entity125 as the official language , the declaration stated that @entity5 's other languages " shall be deemed national ones " -- falling short of the level of recognition sought by @entity9 activists			1
@entity54 said @entity9 's " deep - rooted " history as a native language -- which significantly predated @entity125 's arrival in @entity26 -- meant that regarding it as anything less than an official language was illogical			2
@entity21 wanted @entity5 's new leaders to accord @entity9 a similar status to that which it held in @entity236 , where it is estimated more than half of the country 's 32 million people speak @entity9 dialects			1
in 2011 , @entity9 became an official language in @entity236 , taught alongside @entity125 in schools			2
but it remains to be seen what provisions would be contained in the new constitution , to be drafted by a committee chosen by the newly elected congress , said @entity157			0
any broader recognition of @entity33 @entity23 cultural rights would require overcoming greater barriers than the legacy of @entity1 's suppression and scapegoating , said @entity54			1
" our problem is not only the 42 years of the former regime			0
our problem is 1,400 years of @entity30 or @entity259 mentality that has been brought to @entity26 itself			0
it 's a mentality problem , not only with the common people but in the heads of the politicians			0
" he said although there were generally good relations between @entity33 arabs and @entity21 , their rejection of @entity271 ideology and insistence on a distinct @entity23 identity made them a continued target for criticism			0
some political leaders were still inclined to emulate @entity1 by casting suspicion on the @entity9 community for personal gain			2
but @entity54 said although @entity5 's @entity23 renaissance did not enjoy the state support exhibited in @entity236 and @entity281 , he was optimistic the @entity9 culture would continue to flourish			1
" what 's different from @entity281 and @entity236 is that the consciousness of the @entity23 people is stronger in @entity5 , because we 've paid the price , " he said			1
" we have had martyrs who gave their lives to preserve their language , and ensure they are part of the political environment of the new @entity5 for generations to come			2

@entity5 's indigenous @entity9 population had their culture suppressed under @entity1
also known as @entity23 , they could not even give their children @entity9 names
@entity23 culture is blossoming in @entity5
but activists fear that their culture and language will not be protected in the new @entity5
