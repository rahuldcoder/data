-- over the last two years , @entity11 's " @entity10 " has become one of the most popular dramatic series on television due in large part to complex story lines involving morality , survival and human relationships in a post-apocalyptic world			1
it 's also popular because of the fantastic - looking zombies that terrorize the characters each week , thrusting the decision - making process into a very primal , fight - or - flight mentality			1
longtime special effects guru / director @entity17 is the man behind the zombies and has worked on the series since @entity19 , where he 's now a co-executive producer			1
he got his start in the horror business in the mid- ' 80s on @entity23 's " @entity22 " and has since branched out into many other film genres			2
but a television series such as " @entity10 " is a bit different than film work and presents a new set of challenges			1
" i have 25 years ' experience in the genre , so i know what 's been done before , " he says			2
" a lot of the gags we come up with ( on ' @entity10 ' ) are gags that are developed because i 've seen every zombie movie ever made			1
" @entity0 spoke with @entity17 from the set of " @entity10 " in @entity39 , @entity40 , about the show 's popularity , the changing nature of zombie aesthetics and emotional attachment to the undead			1
( the third season of " @entity10 " premieres at 9 p.m. et sunday on @entity11			1
) post-apocalyptic tv is everywhere @entity0 : as someone with such an extensive resume in horror films , what about " @entity10 " makes it so popular ? @entity17 : there ( are ) three really key aspects of the show			1
i 've done a lot of zombie shows and it 's really a delicate balance to have great monsters , great characters and great story			1
( if ) it 's too much of one and not enough of the other , it sort of explodes in your face			2
we really make a concerted effort to make sure everything is balanced , everything is grounded			0
@entity0 : what does it take to make one " @entity10 " zombie ? @entity17 : i have a team of four permanent makeup artists			1
we 've gotten to a point where we 're averaging about an hour and a half per character			1
the extras come into the trailers ; we do n't know who is coming in , and it 's sort of like having a new canvas every single time			1
they all have contact lenses ; they all have custom dentures ; some people we like to make more rotted than others			0
it all depends on the character and what we want to do on that particular day			2
some days , where we only have six or seven walkers , we 're able to take a little bit more time with them , make them particularly decomposed - looking			0
days that we have 60 or 70 , we break it down where we have " hero " makeups , which are features , and " midground " makeups , which are paint jobs , where we paint highlights and shadows on their faces to make them look dead , but they 're not intended to get too close to the camera			0
and we have " deep background			0
" at the beginning of each season , we have what we call " @entity119 , " and what that does is give me an opportunity to audition anywhere from 150 to 200 extras			1
@entity127 grade them on two criteria : look and performance			0
we have a visual aesthetic that is really important to the show and the zombies , that they look thin and gaunt and emaciated			1
we tend to go with thinner people who have a specific kind of bone structure , so when we put prosthetic on them , because makeup is an additive process , it does n't look like we 're building out their face too much			2
the second part of it is performance			2
the actor has to bring it to life			0
it 's very important that our walkers are genuine and authentic			2
@entity0 : has the zombie aesthetic evolved over the course of three seasons ? do you play around with that stuff ? @entity17 : oh yeah , all the time			1
when we did season one , when it was over , i sat down and made a list of what i thought worked successfully in season one and what i thought we could refine			2
season two came up , and we had refined the look of the zombies , the design of the contact lenses , design of the dentures			2
it 's the same with season three			0
this season , we 've used a lot of animatronic puppets , we 've used practical gags to accent the zombie kills			0
every time i watch an episode , i 'm always thinking about how we can refine it , how it can be better			0
@entity0 : there 's a scene in season two where the young girl @entity185 emerges as a zombie from the barn			1
what are some of the conversations ( you ) had when crafting a zombie character that has such an emotional attachment to the group ? @entity17 : it 's challenging , from an emotional standpoint and a story content point			1
... she needed to be recognizable ; she needed to be empathetic - looking			0
that 's one of the things we 've been able to impart on our zombies that has n't really been done in any other show			1
you look at some of these zombies and you feel an emotion for them ; you feel compassion or sadness			0
they 're not just flesh - eating monsters ; ( they ) are a symbol of " what we once were			0
" with ( @entity185 ) , it was critical that she was n't horribly disfigured			0
we had done a face cast of her and done a bunch of test makeups on her			0
we really wanted to be able to " keep her			0
" @entity0 : how much does technology factor into your work these days ? @entity17 : if you look at the original " @entity229 , " those gags were all done practical ; there were no @entity231 ( computer - generated imagery ) effects back then			1
that movie was the benchmark for years for zombie effects			0
... things like shooting zombies in the head , in the old days , that would have been done practical with squibs			0
nowadays , if you have @entity242 ( played by @entity243 ) running down the street , and he has to shoot six zombies , it 's not practical to do a head hit on all six of those zombies and do it in a big wide shot			2
so digital technology allows us in the edit , once the shot is cut together , to determine which zombies we want to accentuate with a head hit on them			0
for me , what 's important is to constantly keep the audience guessing			0
the minute the audience thinks they know how you did it , then you got to switch it up			0
what 's next for ' @entity10 ' ?			1
