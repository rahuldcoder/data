@entity0 , @entity1 -- a loud crack echoes throughout the canopy as two young orangutans come tumbling down , grasping at branches along the way to break their fall			1
they recover and sheepishly scamper back up			2
this is lesson one of jungle school here in the forests of central @entity0 , one of the few places where orangutans are being successfully rehabilitated into the wild			1
" they have to learn that their whole environment is completely different from the cage , " says @entity18 of the @entity19			1
" they have to learn that branches and small trees -- the size of bars in the cage -- do n't carry them any longer			0
" " during the first phase of this jungle training , they are very often falling out of the trees because they use rotten branches			0
" the two youngsters swing awkwardly between the trees			0
on the ground below , their trainers keep a watchful eye and try to coax them toward fruit trees			0
learning to forage is another crucial lesson in survival			0
back in the massive enclosure , the orangutans undergo enrichment exercises to keep their minds occupied and prolong their feeding time			1
scientists say the @entity54 orangutan will be the first great ape to go extinct			2
" the orangutan is an extremely vulnerable species because they have a very slow breeding cycle			1
usually an orangutan stays for around 7 to 9 years with its mother , " @entity18 says			1
" besides natural mortality , if there is only a little increase in mortality over a longer time already it drives an orangutan population to extinction			2
" the numbers of @entity54 orangutans have already dwindled to around 6,000			2
the main reason for that is habitat destruction			0
@entity0 has lost 85 percent of its natural forest , mainly due to palm oil and pulp and paper companies , scientists say			1
the sanctuary , a @entity79 , is just outside the @entity80			0
the lowlands surrounding it are an ideal habitat for orangutans , and it 's where those that have been released are choosing to build their habitats			1
according to the environmental group @entity90 , it 's also home to the endangered @entity54 elephant and a quarter of the critically endangered @entity54 tigers left in the wild			1
but the area , which is not currently protected , is being threatened by pulp and paper companies that want to see the region turned into plantations			1
so far the government has rejected logging permits , but unless this is declared a conservation area , @entity18 and other conservationists fear that could change			1
so far , more than 100 orangutans have been released here , with just over a dozen more in various stages of training			2
@entity18 has lived here since he established the sanctuary seven years ago , dedicating his entire life to this project			1
" it 's like fighting for a member of my family , " he says			2
" i love them because they are smart , smarter than other great apes			0
" but he says the fight is not just about the extinction of a species			0
the orangutan has become the ambassador for the threatened rainforest			2
" if we sacrifice these forests , we may sacrifice our chances for getting medicine for important diseases , " he says			0
" the problem is there is no second chance			0
if you shut down an ecosystem that is hundreds of years old , you ca n't regrow it any longer			0
" so this is the last chance			0

@entity18 says orangutans in @entity0 are threatened by pulp and paper companies
he 's working to *introduce* orangutans back into the wild
" the orangutan is an extremely vulnerable species , " @entity18 says
