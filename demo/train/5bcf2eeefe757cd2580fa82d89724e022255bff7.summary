-- the world 's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment , the @entity1 said friday			1
these two adult frilled - neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in @entity9			0
the @entity1 's latest @entity10 shows terrestrial , freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005 , with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop			1
the index is included in a report called " 2010 and beyond : rising to the @entity20 , " which the @entity1 prepared for an international biodiversity conference in @entity22 later this month			0
" no one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters , and greater effects from global warming , " said @entity1 , director - general of @entity24			0
the @entity10 measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species , which the @entity1 says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends			0
terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35 - year period , the @entity1 said			1
marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period , with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005 , the @entity1 said			1
" many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence , and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world 's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched , " the @entity1 report said			1
freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003			2
the @entity1 said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet , inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species			2
in tropical regions , freshwater species were especially hard - hit ; the index shows they suffered a 35 - percent drop between 1970 and 2000			2
the @entity1 said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003			2
the causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere , such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems , the @entity1 said			0
the dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species ' capacity to replace itself , the @entity1 said			1
@entity85 is also a threat to terrestrial species , according to the report , which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals			0
overharvesting of timber is also a major factor , it said			0
invasive species , whether introduced deliberately or not , are another threat , especially in freshwater ecosystems , where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species , the @entity1 said			1
pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity , it said			1
the @entity1 called on governments attending this month 's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010			0
it wants governments to establish protected areas , particularly those areas important for food security , water supply , medicine , and disaster mitigation , and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020 .			0

the world 's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of humans
@entity1 : terrestrial , freshwater , marine species all under threat
pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing loss of wildlife
