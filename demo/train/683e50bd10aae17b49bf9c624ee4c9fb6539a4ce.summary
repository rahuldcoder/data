to people on the streets of @entity3 , @entity4 , and many around the world who watched it unfold , it seemed like a scene out of another country			1
" they are now firing into the crowd , " a reporter says wednesday night as loud blasts and fiery sparks show tear gas canisters apparently being shot by police			2
" they 're firing rubber bullets , " a reporter with @entity21 is heard saying on video			2
" they 're attacking reporters ; they are attacking civilians			2
they are firing up on the media			0
" @entity3 police chief @entity26 said pepper bullets were used			1
a @entity29 crew also found spent crowd - control stun grenades lying in the street			0
all the details of what happened amid protests over a police officer 's fatal shooting of an unarmed teen have yet to come in			2
multiple law enforcement agencies from the city , county and state levels have been dispatched to calm the protests			1
in the chaos , it was not immediately clear which agencies did what exactly -- though @entity3 mayor @entity45 did say thursday that @entity49 police have been " in charge tactically since sunday			1
@entity4 gov. @entity52 announced thursday the @entity53 will head up security because " at this particular point , the attitudes were n't improving			0
" @entity4 state troopers take over security in @entity3 even if things turn around quickly , though , it wo n't erase the memories from this past week or end the debate about tactics			1
chief among them are decisions like deploying heavily armed officers and using military equipment , which some experts say helped to make a bad situation even worse			1
retired lt. gen. @entity71 knows a thing or two about this kind of thing , having been dispatched to @entity75 in 2005 to lead recovery efforts after @entity77			1
what authorities in @entity3 should have done , he said , is have " front line policemen " to face protesters , not a swat team			1
" the tactics they are using , i do n't know where they learned them from , " @entity71 said thursday on " @entity83			1
" " it appears they may be making them up on the way			0
but this is escalating the situation			0
" 5 things to know about @entity97 's shooting what should police do with unruly protesters ? sen. @entity101 , @entity4 , echoed that view thursday , saying her " constituents are allowed to have peaceful protests , and the police need to respect that right and protect that right			2
" " this kind of response by the police has become the problem instead of the solution , " she added			1
police said they responded with force only after the @entity116 cocktails were thrown at them , and news photos showed some young men in the crowd lighting them			2
yet @entity121 of @entity122 disputes this sequence , saying police started the violence and protesters responded			2
@entity127 , an @entity128 legal analyst , said if there are some protesters who are unruly -- unlike the majority -- then police " need to isolate those people and perhaps respond to them as opposed to firing upon the crowd in general			2
" but the chief said police ca n't possibly go through the crowd and just remove certain individuals			2
" if the crowd is getting violent , and you do n't want to be violent , get out of the crowd , " he said of protesters			0
@entity140 , a former @entity141 police official who now serves as @entity128 's law enforcement analyst , cautioned against rushing to judge police over wednesday night 's fighting			1
" if there were , being thrown , rocks and bottles and @entity116 cocktails , then they had to respond in kind , " he argued			0
but @entity140 also said he has serious questions about the arrest of two journalists inside a @entity153 's by an officer who , according to reports , refused to provide his name			0
" why did the police come in and ask them to leave ? " @entity140 asks			2
if there were a problem , it would be " up to the manager , the general manger of that establishment , to ask them to leave			0
i want to know what department these officers were from			0
and if i ask an officer , ' what is your name and badge number , ' that officer better give it to me			0
" @entity97 shooting , protests highlight racial divide ' in middle america , you do n't need leftover equipment from @entity179 ' critics of the law enforcement response include attorney general @entity182 , who said " the scenes playing out in the streets of @entity3 over the last several nights can not continue			1
" some blame lay with protesters , he said			0
even though " the vast majority ... have been peaceful , " others have been marred by violence , looting and antagonizing of law enforcement			1
yet law enforcement 's aim should be to " reduce tensions , not heighten them , " he said			1
that means respecting " at all times " the rights of those gathered to express sympathy with @entity97 's family as well as the ability of journalists to report the story			0
( two reporters were detained and then released without charges wednesday			0
) " at a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community , i am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message , " @entity182 added			1
throughout the week , authorities in @entity3 have said the armored vehicles and weaponry have been in place to keep the peace			1
yet civil liberty advocates and others disagree , saying the response in @entity3 is symptomatic of larger , disturbing trends in law enforcement			1
in an extensive report issued weeks ago , the @entity224 stated " @entity227 policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized , in large part through federal programs that have armed state and local law enforcement agencies with the weapons and tactics of war , with almost no public discussion or oversight			1
" " militarization of policing encourages officers to adopt a ' warrior ' mentality and think of the people they are supposed to serve as enemies , " the report added			2
rep. @entity243 is among those who do n't think such equipment makes sense in @entity3			1
he told @entity29 he and rep. @entity247 want to personally urge defense secretary @entity248 to institute " very stringent requirements " whenever military equipment is disbursed , including special training of police			1
" i think the heavy equipment probably should go to only cities like @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , where there is always a threat of some kind of a terrorist attack , " @entity243 said			2
" but in @entity263 , you do n't need leftover equipment from @entity179			0
" veterans critical of police response @entity267 , an @entity268 veteran who focuses on security issues for the @entity270 , contends that police sometimes do " need high - powered weaponry " and other tools to go after " up - armored " and heavily armed criminals			1
" it 's really scary , " he says			0
but that does n't mean the way @entity3 police used some of that equipment made sense , he argues			1
videos showed " a bunch of guys on top of an armored personnel carrier , " @entity267 said			0
" when we 're rolling around in @entity289 and there is a threat of being shot , you do n't sit on top of an @entity293			0
" @entity267 says it 's unfair to the military to call what happened in @entity3 evidence of " militarization , " saying @entity227 soldiers are well " trained in escalation of force			1
" the police apparently " had their weapons up and pointed at protesters who are obviously unarmed , " he said			1
in the military , he learned that " your force posture matches the threat			0
you only raise your weapon if there is a threat that requires lethal force			0
" with a pointed weapon , @entity267 said , " you could make a mistake , maybe get startled , put your finger on the trigger and shoot somebody who does n't deserve to be shot			0
" and threatening people unnecessarily can increase the tensions and danger , exacerbating the situation , he says			0
" a crowd kind of has a mind of its own that develops over time , depending on what threat they perceive			0
" @entity267 is n't alone			0
" as someone who studies policing in conflict , what 's going on @entity3 is n't just immoral and probably unconstitutional , it 's ineffective , " @entity268 veteran @entity330 wrote on @entity331			2
@entity330 is now senior editor of @entity337 , which analyzes national security issues			0
his was one of the tweets included in a storify being shared widely online thursday morning , with this line at the top : " the general consensus here : if this is militarization , it 's the s * * * iest , least - trained , least professional military in the world , using weapons far beyond what they need , or what the military would use when doing crowd control			1
" in another , author and former @entity358 logistics officer @entity356 wrote : " our ( @entity360 ) regarding who we could point weapons at in @entity289 was more restrictive than cops in @entity364			0
" a white man 's response to @entity3 complete coverage on the @entity3 shooting and protests			1

*congressman* to call for " very stringent requirements " on disbursed military equipment
some claim the response in @entity3 shows militarization of law enforcement
veterans : police are getting military weapons without the same training and rules
lt. gen. @entity71 : " you 're in trouble " when swat team is called for civil disturbance
