-- just ten miles south of the @entity2 city of @entity3 is a remarkable place carved from salt			1
hidden 1,000 feet ( 305 meters ) underground lies a dimly - lit labyrinth of subterranean chambers , with saline lakes , horses ' stables , a chapel and even a salt - sculpted hall			2
decorated with elaborate sculptures -- the most astounding perhaps being " @entity15 " carved into a rock salt wall -- even the crystals of the chapel 's chandeliers are hewn from salt , dissolved and reconstituted to resemble glass			2
it might sound like something out of a @entity25 novel , but the @entity27 salt mine is not science fiction but one of @entity2 's 13 @entity29 , many of which date back to the medieval period			1
@entity34 's @entity33 ( meticulously reconstructed after 85 % of the capital 's historic center was destroyed during the war ) and @entity39 concentration camp are must - visit spots			1
but beyond them , you can find hundreds of years ' worth of fairytale - like medieval history			1
deeper underground few places capture the imagination like the salt mine at @entity27 , believed to have been completed in 1280			2
tourists can delve into its depths on guided tours			2
" you see a little more than 1 % of the mine on the tourist route , " said @entity50 , a guide for more than 20 years			2
consider that the tourist route is three kilometers ( 1.8 miles ) long and takes three hours to explore			2
" it would take years to see all of the mine , " said @entity50			0
" there are nine levels , with 300 kilometers ( 186 miles ) of tunnels and more than 3,000 chambers			0
" tourists view the mine at just over 300 feet ( 91 meters ) below the surface , but its intricacies continue down for more than double that depth			0
mining here was dangerous work ; there were cave - ins , and occasional methane explosions			0
this accounts for why the miners built the chapel in the 14th century -- they prayed constantly for their safety , and carved religious figures in their spare time			0
( @entity50 estimated " @entity15 " alone would have taken a year to complete			0
) however , the job came with its perks			0
" there was great respect for the miners among the community on the surface , " he noted			0
" and they were given privileges by @entity2 kings			1
for example , each worker was allowed to carry three kilograms of salt to the surface with them each month and sell it			0
@entity93 was ( a valuable ) preservative and was almost as expensive as silver			0
" " vampires " in @entity3 the salt would doubtless have been traded at @entity3 's @entity98 , the largest medieval market square in @entity100 and the site of another intriguing underground voyage			1
in 2005 , an archaeological dig in the square was intended to last six months , but stretched into five years , such was the volume of treasures exhumed			0
the result is @entity108 , a subterranean museum built under the square			0
" the square has risen about four meters since early medieval times , " said @entity111 , an archaeologist at the museum			1
" over the years , the debris from earlier phases ( of the square 's history ) was spread across its surface			0
" read more : @entity3 becomes world center for literature while the entire historical center of @entity3 is a @entity29 site , the 40,000 square meters of @entity98 is its beating heart			1
in the 14th and 15th centuries it was a major center of @entity100 trade , abuzz with merchants selling everything from luxury goods ( such as silks and spices ) to cloth and lead			2
as well as seeing some of those treasures , visitors to the museum can also see reconstructions of burial sites that were discovered during the dig , including what @entity111 called " anti-vampiric burials "			2
" there are a few with tied hands and legs , probably due to the remains of @entity150 beliefs , " he said			0
choosing their religion diversity of belief is a uniting facet of @entity2 's @entity29 heritage sites			1
among the prettiest listed monuments are the wooden churches of @entity159			0
winding through the looming mountains and sprawling fields of this picturesque pocket of south east @entity2 , are 1,500 kilometers ( 932 miles ) of trails that take hikers past striking examples of timber churches in everything from @entity168 to @entity170 styles			1
read more : @entity172 thrive in @entity2 's wild woods " the multicultural history of @entity2 is marked by the variety of houses of worship from different periods , " said @entity174 , of the @entity175			1
she pointed to the 18th and 19th century wooden mosques that can be found in north east @entity2 by way of example			1
indeed , @entity174 revealed that a 14th @entity29 site has been approved -- wooden @entity186 and @entity187 churches , dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries , in the @entity190 mountain range			1
and yet another enduring example of @entity2 's long tradition of religious tolerance is the @entity29 - listed @entity194 in @entity195 and @entity196			1
these 17th century protestant churches were permitted by a @entity168 emperor following the @entity199 , which had sprung from those very religions ' rivalry			0
but maybe what unites these sites most of all is that , whether deep underground or spread throughout the countryside , @entity2 is rich in a tangible cultural landscape .			1

@entity2 has 13 cultural @entity29 world heritage sites
many of them date back to the medieval period
the whole of the historic center of @entity3 is *declared* a heritage site
