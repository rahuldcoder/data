editor 's note : @entity2 is a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to @entity4			1
@entity2 says " @entity6 in @entity7 " tells the real story of his community , for better and for worse			1
@entity10 , @entity11 ( @entity4 ) -- have you ever seen 47 million people hold their breath and hope for the best ? take it from this @entity6 in @entity7 , when many of my compadres heard that @entity4 was putting together a documentary on being " @entity6 in @entity7 , " that 's pretty much what happened			1
for those of us in the @entity6 community who worry that those of us in the media are missing the best and most nuanced stories about @entity7 's largest minority because we 're too busy harping on stereotypes and accentuating the negative -- " i 'll take an order of high school dropouts , with a side of gangbangers and mix in some gardeners and housekeepers " -- there was a concern that @entity4 would blow the assignment			1
at least the cable network had the courage to take it on			2
many of its competitors -- @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , etc. -- still broadcast in black - and - white and have n't grasped the absurdity of producing sunday morning talk shows where journalists and pundits gather for roundtable discussions that touch on @entity6 issues without a single @entity6 at the table			1
having watched the documentary , which airs october 21 - 22 , i can see that it 's time to exhale			1
i can also see that the smartest decision network executives made was putting this project in the very capable hands of my @entity64 classmate , @entity63 -- more commonly known as @entity63			2
the award - winning correspondent -- whose mother is black and @entity6 , and whose father is @entity69 with @entity71 roots -- appears to have understood instantly why many @entity72 are leery of projects like this			2
in a recent essay on @entity4 , @entity63 wrote : " it was clear that the community felt starved for good solid coverage			2
no one asked me to do a snow job			2
just please do n't reduce us to crime , immigration and racial conflicts , they asked			0
folks just did n't want to see their community hurt anymore and were very blunt about it			2
one afternoon i had lunch with @entity90 in @entity91 , " @entity63 wrote			0
" she is a beloved @entity92 actor who has been reduced to the role of the maid or the nanny in scores of movies			0
i asked @entity90 to be a major character in our documentary , and she offered an enormous amount of assistance			0
when i left the table she turned to my producer and said bluntly in @entity105 , " please , just do n't f -- us			0
" in the end , what you see is n't all cotton candy and lemonade -- or , in this case , churros and chocolate			0
there are negative images , peppered throughout stories about dropouts , teenage pregnancy , illegal immigration , crime , depression , etc. but there is also plenty of the positive , and most of the clouds have silver linings			0
along the way , we meet " the @entity130 " -- not one family , but a series of different individuals from throughout the country , all of them named " @entity137			0
" there 's @entity139 , a fourth - generation @entity141 - @entity7 immigrants ' rights activist in @entity142 , who organized a protest against @entity145 sheriff @entity144 , a media hound who rounds up illegal immigrants and is being investigated by the @entity149 over allegations of racially profiling @entity7 - born @entity6 in the process			1
the protest turns into a piñata party when someone hangs a papier - mâché caricature of @entity144 and protesters whack it with sticks			2
there 's also @entity158 , a @entity105 - language tv chef and businesswoman who some consider the " latina @entity161 , " who was told to lose her accent and instead has found her language and culture to be assets that help make her unique and successful as she builds her brand			1
we also meet @entity170 and @entity171 , who moved from @entity172 to @entity173 and now feel disconnected from their culture			0
he 's from @entity176 and she 's from the @entity178 , but their sons think of themselves as @entity7			1
one of them even flunked @entity105 in high school			0
to think that there are still @entity7 out there who think that @entity72 are n't assimilating			1
in fact , conservative commentator @entity185 insists that not only are @entity72 not assimilating at present , but they also never have throughout history			2
following the script laid out by the @entity71 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 who came before them , @entity72 are learning @entity193 , having smaller families , starting businesses , moving to the suburbs , joining the @entity197 and sending their kids to college			0
many of them are just -- like the @entity71 , @entity190 and @entity191 who came before them -- trying to find ways to do all that while still preserving their culture and heritage			0
in the meantime , many of them are in a kind of holding pattern			0
they 're considered too @entity141 or too @entity210 or too @entity211 to be @entity7			1
and yet at the same time , were they to visit their ancestral homelands , they 'd be considered too @entity7 to be @entity141 or @entity210 or @entity211			1
for @entity6 , this is the dickensian era , the best of times and the worst of times			1
they 're being pursued by @entity144 and by @entity220 companies hungry for their slice of an estimated $ 800 billion in annual spending power			0
latinos are being told to learn @entity193 when , for many , the real challenge is preserving their @entity105			1
they are in all 50 states , representing 15 percent of the population now and on track to make up as much as 25 percent by 2032			0
meanwhile , with all the issues out there , some @entity7 still get stuck on the basics of whether they should call us " @entity6 " or " @entity6 " -- or @entity141 , @entity210 , @entity211			1
who cares ? you can call us whatever you want			0
you just ca n't ignore us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2			1

@entity2 : 47 million @entity7 are latino
he says story of their community is told in *detail* in " @entity244 "
he says latinos are assimilating in @entity7 despite challenges
for latino - americans , these are the best and worst of times , he says
