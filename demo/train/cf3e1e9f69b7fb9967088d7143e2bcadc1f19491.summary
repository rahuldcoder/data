-- on tuesday , there will be a vote in @entity3 that may turn out to be the first major skirmish in the 2012 battle for the @entity6			1
at issue is a law known as @entity9			1
the law , passed by the @entity3 legislature at the end of march , restricts the ability of public employees to engage in collective bargaining			1
even before the ink on @entity3 gov. @entity20 's signature on @entity9 had time to dry , public employee unions in @entity3 and their allies began the process of gathering the signatures necessary to invoke a provision in the @entity24 that allows legislation to be placed before the state 's voters			1
within a few months , @entity9 opponents had managed to collect nearly 1 million valid signatures , more than three times what they needed to place the law on the november ballot			1
the campaign to repeal @entity9 , led by a group called " we are @entity3 , " quickly went national			1
for example , @entity36 donated $ 2 million to we are @entity3 , while , the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) and the @entity40 of @entity41 kicked in more than $ 1 million apiece			0
as @entity43 draws near , those who support @entity9 have also attracted out - of - state assistance			1
@entity45 , the group whose legal challenge led to the watershed 2010 @entity49 campaign finance decision , spent $ 100,000 on @entity51 @entity9 commercials			1
why all this national interest in an @entity3 issue ? former house speaker @entity54 was famous for saying that " all politics is local			0
" well , in @entity3 , all politics is also national			0
@entity3 is the quintessential swing state			0
although shrinking in population relative to the rest of the country ( after the 2010 census , the @entity3 state lost two seats in @entity64 ) , @entity3 's electoral vote total is seen by the @entity65 and the @entity66 as being both up - for - grabs , and crucial to putting together an electoral majority			1
it is no accident , therefore , that since becoming president , @entity70 has visited @entity3 more than any other state			2
still , president @entity70 's laser - like focus on @entity3 has yielded little in the way of political support for him or his party			1
during the 2010 midterm election , democrats in @entity3 were swept out of power			2
republicans managed to capture the governor 's mansion and every other statewide office , 13 of the state 's 18 congressional seats ( a gain of 5 seats ) , and a majority in the @entity90 ( they already controlled the @entity91 )			2
@entity81 in @entity3 and nationwide saw in the results of the 2010 elections a mandate to trim back government at all levels			0
taking on public employee unions was a logical step in this plan			0
still , one ca n't ignore the fact that , in seeking to weaken public employee unions , the @entity81 were also taking on the very groups who would be expected to bankroll @entity66 in 2012			1
but if @entity9 was fueled as much by politics as by ideology , the approach may have backfired			2
polls have shown @entity9 to be enormously unpopular			2
even the bill 's supporters are not optimistic that it will survive tuesday 's vote			1
the fear now among @entity81 is not only that @entity9 will be repealed , but that organized labor in @entity3 will emerge from this victory newly energized and better positioned to achieve its goals			1
this will not bode well for the @entity81 in 2012			0
there is a fascinating historical parallel to all of this			0
back in 1958 , business owners in @entity3 got together and placed a proposed constitutional amendment on the state 's ballot that would have made @entity3 a right - to - work state			0
the proposal was soundly defeated , with 60 % of the voters rejecting the measure			0
the voters of @entity3 , however , did not just vote against the amendment ; they also voted against the @entity81 that was seen to have backed the measure			0
in the election of 1958 , the incumbent @entity81 governor , a longtime @entity81 senator and nearly every statewide @entity81 office holder went down in defeat			0
polls showing @entity9 losing by nearly the same margin as the 1958 right - to - work measure ought to be sending chills down the spines of @entity65			2
of course , gov. @entity20 and the other statewide office holders who were elected in 2010 are not on the ballot this tuesday , and in fact will not have to face the voters again until 2014			0
but there will be a @entity81 presidential candidate on the ballot next year			0
it will be interesting to see if history repeats itself			0
since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning @entity3 , it may well be that vote to repeal @entity9 in @entity3 helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in january of 2013			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity162 will vote tuesday on whether to repeal @entity9
@entity160 says the battle over the repeal could be first skirmish in 2012 election
he says unions and @entity66 *mobilized* to repeal law restricting collective bargaining
@entity160 : if the law is repealed , it may *embolden* and *strengthen* @entity70 's allies
