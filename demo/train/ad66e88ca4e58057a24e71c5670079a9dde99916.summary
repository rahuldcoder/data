-- while an art student at @entity4 , @entity2 illustrator @entity1 watched " @entity5 "			1
as with the generations of fans that preceded him , he was struck by the film 's epic quality			2
though the movie is set in the future , @entity1 was reminded of the colorful @entity15 miniatures that illustrated @entity2 literature from the 16th century			1
gallery : cult classics reimagined as @entity15 miniatures " i kept on trying to imagine what ' @entity5 ' would look like if it was placed in the @entity15 era , so i decided it would be good to illustrate it , " he recalls			1
@entity1 soon got hooked on reimagining @entity26 cult classics in the @entity28 tradition			1
for his graduation project , he expanded his portfolio to include antique - style versions of several cult classics , including " @entity33 , " " @entity34 " and an array of @entity37 and @entity38 movies			1
" i guess i just really like movies , " he admits			2
" i just wanted to make fun of them , but not in a mean way			2
" there is an underlying playfulness throughout his illustrations			0
each took a full day or two to complete using a combination of handmade stencils , watercolors and @entity50			0
in his rendition of " @entity53 , " @entity51 shoots down his foes while wearing a fez			0
his " @entity57 " gangsters drive horse and buggies instead of cars and in " @entity62 , " @entity61 rides a bicycle made of wood			0
" the first time i mentioned my project to my teachers , they did n't understand it , " @entity1 admits			1
" they said , ' why do n't you illustrate @entity2 movies ? ' i told them there 's no point			2
i wanted to combine not just the two cultures -- @entity26 and @entity28 -- but the two styles : modern and traditional			0
" they were impressed when they saw the finished product , however , and @entity1 , since graduated , has moved on to display his work ( he 's gearing up for an exhibition in @entity83 , @entity84 at the @entity85 )			1
the project is also far from over			0
" i 'm still working on it , " he admits			0
" i think next i 'll illustrate ' @entity88 ' and ' 2001 : @entity89 , ' or maybe ' @entity90			1
' " gallery : @entity94 epic @entity92 , remade for the digital age interactive : press freedom in the @entity98			0
