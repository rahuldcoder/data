@entity0 , @entity1 -- i dont tlk on th fone			2
i tried to reach my teenage daughter the other day			2
i left a voice mail , sent an e-mail message and finally texted her and told her to check both and call me back			2
seconds later , she texted back one letter : " @entity14 " she is 19 and has been sending and receiving upwards of 3,000 texts per month			0
one month , she hit 7,500 ! she is not unusual at all			0
according to @entity18 , in the first quarter of 2009 , the average @entity16 teen made and received an average of 191 phone calls and sent and received 2,899 text messages per month			1
by the third quarter , the number of texts had jumped to a whopping 3,146 messages per month , which equals more than 10 texts per every waking non-school hour			1
( at the beginning of 2007 , those numbers were 255 phone calls and 435 text messages			1
) preteens sent and received 1,146 texts per month			0
my daughter does n't answer her phone because to her , it is no longer a phone			0
we are in the midst of four distinct generations of @entity16 : @entity42 ( born 1946 - 64 ) , @entity43 ( 1965 - 79 ) , @entity44 ( 1980 - 89 ) and the new @entity45 ( born in the 1990s and beyond and given the " i " designation to represent media such as ipods and the @entity49 but also to reflect the " individualized " nature of their media )			1
until recently , " communicate " meant to talk face - to - face or on the phone			0
but both the @entity44 and the @entity45 have turned the concept of communication upside down			1
the old ways are , well , old			0
it is now all about texting , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 - ing -- pretty much anything but talking live or on the phone			0
i know that this is alarming to many , but quite honestly , people must recognize that this is the way it is now and is going to be -- at least until the next new form of e-communication bursts into our world			1
if you have a teenager ( or even a preteen ) , for example , you must learn how to text , or you two will never " connect			1
" to this generation , it is all about connection , but those connections are , for the most part , electronic			1
it is important to note that although experts agree about the two older generations , not everyone agrees on " defining " the last two generations			1
they are called @entity44 and @entity44 by some and , as far as their demarcation dates , well , that is open to fierce discussion			0
from my research with 3,000 @entity16 , the final two generations are defined not by a letter or by their birth year but by their use of technology and media , their need and ability to multitask , their rapid acceptance of anything new and their view of the meaning of technology			1
all of which lead to differences in personal and work values and often to disharmony in the family , school and the workplace			0
in my research , we query people about daily media activities as well as those they choose during free time			1
we find striking generational differences			0
older teens and net geners spend more than 20 hours per day using media			0
this is accomplished not by not sleeping but with considerable multitasking , which peaks at seven simultaneous activities for older teens			0
setting aside music ( with its omnipresent ear buds ) , preferred media choices differ dramatically across generations : for children , it 's television ; for tweens , it 's video games ; for teens , it 's texting and social networking ; and for @entity138 and gen @entity139 , it 's being online			1
and for boomers , it 's , of course , back to television			1
the roots of these differences lie in the origin and pace of technological change , particularly among the most recent generations			1
net geners were early adopters of the @entity149 , which they came to view as a valuable tool			0
@entity152 , however , are different			0
they know no other world than that of the @entity156 , texting and social networking			1
they were online when they could sit up and sent an e-mail to @entity161 ; they made @entity164 a household name by their early teens			0
they live in their own bedroom " @entity168 , " where new technologies appear and penetrate society in months rather than years			0
although the telephone took 20 years to reach 50 million users , the @entity156 took four years , @entity173 three and @entity164 two , and @entity174 hit 50 million users in one year			0
the @entity45 is driving these consumer trends			0
individuals in this group watch more than 100 @entity174 videos a month , download apps , @entity164 and @entity59 ( now verbs ) , and text the night away			1
they do n't see technology as a tool			2
for them , it is just life			2
these generational differences have tremendous ramifications for the family , education and the workplace			0
parents are upset that their children multitask and yet are perplexed that they can balance all their technology and do well in school			2
teachers struggle to reconcile their need to have students read books , do worksheets and pay attention in class ( unitasking ) while students want multitasking technologies			0
bosses want meetings ( more unitasking ) , goals and progress reports , while their gen x and net gen employees want to do it their way through multitasking and flex time			2
these differences permeate every system and cause parents , teachers and bosses to tear their hair out			0
yet those pesky multitasking kids are the smartest generation ever , with high professional aspirations			2
some may call them narcissistic , but they are really a highly social generation ( albeit with much of the socializing done online ) ; they value family , revere friendship ( some " virtual " ) , consume massive quantities of information ( again , much of it online ) and are the most " communicating " generation yet			1
but to us " old fogies , " it seems like they are just chatting aimlessly , sending brief tweets with funny acronyms that make no sense ( could you decipher the text message at the beginning of this article ? )			2
they text while they walk ( sometimes into trees ) and keep their cell phones on vibrate while they sleep			1
no one really has a choice but to accept their world and learn to adapt			0
the @entity138 and @entity152 will soon be the country 's parents , teachers , bosses and political leaders , and their techie style will become the norm			2
we may not like it , but we have to admit that they are happy , successful and engaged with all their media and technology			1
i may have to text my daughter to get her attention , but i am also bewildered and awed by her mastery of anything new and amazed at how she can balance her media and college and maintain an a average at @entity273			1
watch out for the young ones who are already surfing the @entity277 at 2			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			1

@entity280 says in third quarter of 2009 , average teen had 3,146 text messages
there are four generations now , he says ; oldest use phones , youngest anything but
for young people , electronic communication is not about technology , it 's just life , he says
@entity280 : next generation is highly social , successful and *plugged* in . it 's time to get used to it
