@entity1 , @entity0 -- three attempts to pump mud and 16 tries to stuff solid material into a breached @entity10 oil well failed to stop the flow , top @entity4 executives said saturday , and engineers and executives with the oil giant have decided to " move on to the next option			1
" that option : place a custom - built cap to fit over the " lower marine riser package , " @entity4 chief operation officer @entity17 said			1
@entity4 crews were already at work saturday to ready the materials for that option , he said			1
@entity17 said three separate pumping efforts and 30,000 barrels of mud -- along with what chief executive officer @entity27 described as " 16 different bridging material shots " -- just did n't do the trick			0
" we have not been able to stop the flow , " a somber @entity17 told reporters			2
" ... repeated pumping , we do n't believe , will achieve success , so we will move on to the next option			2
" suttles and other officials said that the " top kill " attempt to stop the flow did so -- but only as long as they were pumping			1
when the pumping stopped , the oil resumed its escape			2
and @entity45 rear adm. @entity45 said that @entity4 would resume using undersea dispersants for the new attempt to trap the oil			1
@entity17 said the lower marine riser package cap " should be able to capture most of the oil " that has fed what is now the largest oil spill in @entity55 history , but he cautioned that the new cap will not provide a " tight mechanical seal			1
" " we 're confident the job will work , but obviously we can not guarantee success at this time , " he said			0
engineers should be ready in about four to seven days to make the fresh attempt , he said			0
@entity62 said officials were " disappointed in today 's announcement , " but noted that the immediate efforts to stop the flow were never intended to be permanent			1
" the real solution , the end state , is a relief well , " she said			2
@entity4 currently is working on two relief wells , but they are not expected to be ready until august , @entity17 said			1
earlier , @entity17 said that @entity4 engineers would try to place a second blowout preventer -- the piece of equipment that failed when the @entity76 exploded on april 20 -- should the lower marine riser package fail			1
the failed blowout preventer is a 48 - foot - tall , 450 - ton apparatus that sits atop the well 5,000 feet underwater			0
@entity17 and @entity62 praised the clean - up efforts , however , in light of the failure of the " top kill " attempt to stop the flow			1
" it 's a tribute to everybody that we only have 107 miles of shoreline oiled and only 32 acres of marsh , " @entity62 said			0
meanwhile , teams in @entity0 were working saturday on a clean - up project aimed at protecting coastal marshes			2
@entity95 president @entity94 has said that machines would suck oil out of marshes saturday after crews determined where to deploy them			1
but @entity94 told @entity2 that @entity4 needed to " step up to the plate tonight to save our wetlands " by using its might to create sand barriers to prevent the oil from moving into the marshes			1
" @entity4 needs to say it will pay to move those dredges and pump that sand berm , " he said			1
" we are gon na die a slow death if we do n't get that berm			0
we 've got to have that barrier island			2
" president @entity115 , who toured the area friday , said federal officials were prepared to authorize moving forward with " a portion of " an idea proposed by local officials , who want the @entity121 to build a " sand boom " offshore to keep the water from getting into the fragile marshlands			1
but @entity94 said the marshes could n't wait and that the effort needed to start immediately to save the @entity0 wetlands			2
government scientists on thursday said as many as 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil were spewing into the ocean every day , making this disaster perhaps twice the size of the @entity134 incident			2
previously , @entity4 officials and government scientists had said 5,000 barrels ( 210,000 gallons ) of crude were flowing out daily			1
" this is clearly an environmental catastrophe , " @entity27 said friday			0
" there 's no two ways about it			0
" in an e-mail message sent out after the announcement saturday , @entity27 said he was " disappointed that this operation did n't work			0
" " the team executed the operation perfectly , and the technology worked without a single hitch , " he said			0
" we remain committed to doing everything we can to make this situation right			0
" @entity115 's visit to the region came under intense political pressure to take control of the situation			0
" we want to stop the leak , we want to contain and clean up the oil and we want to help the people in this region return to their lives and livelihoods as soon as possible , " the president told reporters			1
about 25 percent of the @entity10 exclusive economic zone has been put off limits , according to the @entity166 , and fishermen are worried the gushing oil will take a more serious toll than @entity170 did in 2005			0
" @entity170 was nothing but rain , water and wind			0
it 's gas , " oysterman @entity175 said			0
@entity2 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity4 will try lower marine riser package cap next
new : lower marine riser package cap will capture most , but not all of oil flow
new : officials : only sure option is relief wells , still 2 *months* away
new : parish president wants @entity4 to build sand barrier islands now
workers toil on *beaches* and in marshes to clean up
