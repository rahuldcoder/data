-- my head is still spinning from excitement and disbelief at being chosen for what i know is going to be a life - changing adventure			1
just five weeks ago , i found myself in @entity7 for the @entity9 kickoff weekend			1
as the weekend progressed , i tried to remember every piece of advice we received from the trainers and everyone at @entity0			0
thankfully , the opportunity to spend some time with @entity9 alumni was part of the plan			1
they shared with us the wisdom of their own experiences			0
one bit of advice that i have clung to daily is , " schedule , schedule , schedule ! " i have always overextended myself			1
there are a lot of things that i like to do , and even more that i want to do			0
i also have a hard time saying " no. " getting fit for the family i love after decades of raising three kids and taking care of other family members , my husband and i have found ourselves in a place we have never been before : one with free weekends			1
we are now able to go fishing , boating and camping , attend concerts , visit kids and grandkids , go to movies , go shopping , walk the dogs			0
maybe because it is still a novelty we try to fit all that into just a couple days a week			0
there are a couple of obvious downsides to living this way			0
the first is that my plate generally is n't just full -- it 's spilling over			0
secondly , when i spread myself too thin , the end result is never the quality it would have been if i 'd devoted my full time and energy			1
now , in addition to everything else that i am committed to , i have to fit training for a triathlon into my life			1
the only way i will be successful is if i take seriously the advice to schedule			1
the late and great dr. @entity69 once said , " to become a master of your time , you need to first be aware of your priorities in the larger context of your life			1
" scheduling is not a novel idea or rocket science , but sometimes i just need to hear the right message at the right time in order for it to click in a meaningful way			1
once i looked at the big picture from this perspective , life got a lot less complicated			0
from the very moment i found out i had this once - in - a - lifetime opportunity , i committed to taking full advantage of it , giving it my all			1
the athlete i used to be thankfully for me our coach , @entity92 , is giving us a huge head start			0
each week , she puts our daily workouts on a calendar on the @entity98 website			1
the time of day we do them is up to us , and we can even rearrange the days if need be			2
at the beginning of every week , i compare my work schedule with my training schedule			1
on a day that i need to go to the correctional facility where i work for the 5:45 a.m. roll call , an evening strength training workout makes the most sense			2
on a normal 8 - to - 5 day , i can easily fit in a 5:15 a.m. spinning class or a morning run			2
the pool i swim in does not open until 6 a.m. and is not available in the evenings or weekends			2
so far this has been the biggest scheduling challenge			0
but i have n't missed a workout yet , thanks to @entity116 and a bit of flexibility in my schedule			2
once i see the workout on my calendar , it is not something i should do , or even have to do			2
i can honestly say that i look at it as something that is a priority for me so that i can accomplish my long - term goal of finishing the @entity126 on september 8 ! that does n't mean that i bounce out of bed at 4 a.m. on the days that i go to the local @entity129 for the spinning class , that i have n't wanted to stay in bed on a cold , snowy morning instead of heading across town to do swim drills			1
make your workout go by faster what it does mean is that these types of thoughts are fleeting , and that picturing myself crossing the finish line has helped me to get up , get ready and get started			1
last weekend i did something i still ca n't believe : i actually ran a @entity143			0
and i owe it all to scheduling ! i also owe it to the encouragement and support of my co-warden , @entity148 , and the support of my running partner for the day -- my youngest daughter , @entity151			0
when i shared my news about being on the @entity9 team with @entity148 , he immediately told me about a local @entity143			1
i did n't say it out loud , but my inside voice was telling me that i would not be ready to run 3.2 miles by march 5			0
to be perfectly honest , i was counting on coach april to agree with me when i told her about the race			0
yet a couple of weeks later , that @entity143 was my scheduled training for the day			2
like i said earlier , once it 's on my calendar ... i set two goals for the race			2
the first was to finish , and the second was to run for the entire distance			0
the reason i knew these goals were both attainable is that i had already accomplished them in my scheduled training runs in the weeks before			0
all i can say is , " wow ! " i ca n't wait to see what i can accomplish during the next six months of prioritizing and scheduling ! follow @entity175 on @entity176 @ @entity177			0

schedule workouts into your calendar like a meeting with your boss
prioritizing her *responsibilities* helped @entity187 find time for training
@entity187 plans to cross the finish line with the rest of the @entity9 6 - pack in september
