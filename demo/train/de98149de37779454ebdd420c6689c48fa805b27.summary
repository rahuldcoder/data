-- it was in the majestic surroundings of @entity3 that the original gold - plated superstar of golf secured his first major title			1
the small town of @entity9 to the east of @entity11 that is all set to welcome the modern titans of the game for the 142nd staging of the @entity15 played host to a true pioneer back in 1896			2
@entity18 won a total of six @entity15 titles , a record that still stands , but his achievements in the game stretch far beyond his haul of majors , which was lifted to seven by his 1900 @entity27 triumph			1
not only was he credited with sparking an explosion of interest in the game during his tours of @entity32 at the turn of the @entity34 but he also devised the grip - -- " the overlapping grip " or the " @entity18 overlap " -- that 90 percent of golfers still deploy			1
it is little wonder he is spoken of in such glowing terms by @entity43 @entity42 , who alongside @entity32 legend @entity44 , is just one @entity46 @entity15 triumph behind @entity18 's half - dozen successes			1
" he was the @entity50 of golf , " @entity42 told @entity0 's @entity49 show			1
" to aspire to such a position was sacrilege -- it was way out of my league			0
" it was n't until i passed five that i thought , ' well , it 's possible to equal the great man ' but i did n't do it , regrettably			2
" it must have been inspirational to watch him swing			0
he had the power of a winning champion			0
had someone won seven or even six opens we would n't have had @entity18 as a @entity50			1
" it is perfect it is in stone and concrete that he should be the man who won six			2
it has n't happened before and it is n't likely to happen for many years			0
" i do n't think anyone will reach six because the competition there is today makes it more difficult			0
there are at least 25 players that have a chance of winning any major tournament			0
" @entity18 's prowess on the golf course is indisputable			1
his entry in the @entity84 quotes famed golf writer @entity85 as saying : " i do not think anyone who saw him play in his prime will disagree as to this , that a greater genius is inconceivable			0
" but his legacy stretches far beyond the beauty of the links courses upon which he flourished , securing his first three championships before the turn of the century			0
he became the game 's first international superstar when he traveled to the @entity32 in 1900 , playing 80 exhibition matches around the country , his tour culminating in that @entity27 triumph			1
thousands flocked to see him in action , with many scurrying back to their own courses to try and replicate what they had just seen			0
" there is absolutely no doubt that that the great boom of golf in @entity32 was started by @entity18 , " said @entity106 , former head greenkeeper at @entity107 , where @entity18 learnt the game			1
" the number of people who flooded to see his exhibition matches , the fact that he was asked back again and again prove that			0
" he brought golf into the mainstream for everyone to play and i think that was probably his greatest achievement			0
" and of course he 'll be forever immortalized because of his most famous grip , there 's no getting away from it			0
" @entity18 was born into a working class family in @entity107 , a @entity46 outpost off the coast of @entity129 in @entity130 , and honed his game when the island got its first golf course in 1878			1
both @entity18 and his younger brother started out as caddies and invested hours on practicing their swings , despite their father 's disapproval of the game			1
@entity18 's career blossomed when he left @entity107 for the @entity142 mainland , where his dedication to his craft and insistence on wearing knickerbockers made him stand out from the crowd			1
his victory at @entity3 in 1896 announced his prowess to the world and irked the man he beat -- two - time open champion @entity152			1
" @entity154 was so upset he challenged @entity155 to a home and away match for Â £ 100 , " @entity106 explained			0
" it was a year before they came to play it and @entity18 was two shots up after the first tie at @entity163 where around 10,000 people came to watch			2
" in the second match @entity18 annihilated @entity154 , who went on to become an architect because he knew he was n't going to win anything with @entity18 around			2
" @entity18 was extremely accurate , a straight driver with an immaculate short game			2
it has been said his putting stroke was n't that great but i do n't believe you could win all those tournaments with a weak putting stroke			0
" he had the complete all round game at the height of his powers			0
" @entity18 went on to claim three more open titles before he was struck down by tuberculosis , spending long spells in sanatoriums until 1910			1
yet despite his faltering health , and general lack of fitness , he still came back to win the @entity15 twice more -- in 1911 and 1914			2
according to another graduate of the @entity107 links , former @entity190 star @entity189 , @entity18 's success is made all the more remarkable given his physical frailties			1
" he was never very fit , and when you think about 1914 when he won his last @entity15 , they took him out of hospital two or three weeks before the @entity15 , because he had tuberculosis , " he said			2
" @entity18 was never a very fit man and he had only a few weeks practice , fresh out of hospital and went out and won the @entity15			1
that to me is incredible			0
" @entity18 eventually died in 1937 at the age of 66			2
while illness hampered his career in large parts , it may have also helped prolong it			0
" it 's not very common knowledge , but @entity18 was planning to go to promote the equipment he sponsored , or the sponsors promoted for him , in @entity32 , " @entity189 added			1
" he was going for two or three months as he 'd done before -- they liked him in @entity32 -- but he fell sick , and because of that he did n't travel on the @entity212			2
" @entity18 's haul of six open titles is unlikely to be matched any time soon , but had it not been for @entity216 , it could have been more			1
" he lost six years out of his professional life , " @entity106 added			0
" @entity218 knows how many @entity219 could have won			0
