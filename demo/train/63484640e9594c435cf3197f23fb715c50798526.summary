@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 and other @entity1 cities dealing with record flooding will continue to be threatened by the @entity7 for days to come , even though the water is no longer rising along parts of the river , a @entity4 commander said monday			1
although the river crested in @entity0 early sunday morning , it has only dropped a fraction of an inch since -- leaving crews with the tense , around - the - clock job of constantly inspecting and shoring up emergency levees built to protect critical structures , said lt. col. @entity19 , deputy district engineer for the @entity21 ' @entity20			1
" we 're 99 % complete , but it 's an ongoing fight , " @entity19 said monday			1
the river had crested in @entity0 and appeared to be cresting in the downstream community of @entity26 , @entity19 said			1
the remaining communities along the @entity29 portion of the river -- which begins in @entity31 and loops back into that country downstream of @entity0 -- do not appear threatened , he said			1
overnight , crews had to deal with floodwaters seeping through storm sewer drains and levees , but none of those issues posed major threats , he said			2
workers had to build another ring levee near the @entity42 to protect that critical north - south route through @entity0 from being cut off , @entity19 said			1
@entity45 helicopters also had to drop one - ton sandbags around a school to keep it from flooding			2
the @entity7 crested sunday at @entity0 at nearly 13 feet over flood stage -- below earlier predictions , but still almost 4 feet above an 1881 record , according to the @entity53			1
the river had fallen about 6 inches as of monday morning , according to the weather service , and is predicted to remain above the 1881 record into next week			2
the state was scheduled to open three recovery centers in @entity1 on monday -- two in @entity0 and one in @entity59 -- for residents in the throes of the record - setting floods			1
residents can visit the locations to find out about assistance programs and have their questions answered , gov. @entity67 told reporters			0
but , he said , it is not necessary for residents to visit the centers to register for disaster assistance , which can be done by telephone or online			0
@entity67 said a tour of the area sunday was " sobering , to say the least			0
" a boil - water order , issued as a precaution saturday , remained in effect			0
@entity0 officials told residents that tap water should be boiled for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms			2
@entity86 rep. @entity86 said he had been in touch with officials in @entity89 -- which has authorized @entity91 to grant assistance -- and expressed optimism that the government will work well with residents to overcome the challenges			0
" you 're seeing people at the highest levels working together , putting politics behind them , " said @entity1 's lone congressman			1
many residents of @entity0 who evacuated ahead of the rising water returned to the area sunday against the recommendations of the city officials , hoping to catch a glimpse of their homes , said @entity2 's @entity110			1
@entity110 said when he toured the hardest - hit area by boat , several residents gave him their addresses and asked him to check on their homes			2
everyone was hoping his or her home might be the one that was spared , he said , but he had to bring back bad news			0
" it 's a somber feeling , sitting here , " said resident @entity120			1
he recalled " listening to the sirens go off , and they evacuated us , and coming back the next day and seeing this ... it 's disheartening			1
" but , he said , " we 'll get there			0
" evacuee @entity129 said residents have been helping one another			0
when her family had to evacuate in a hurry , neighbors on both sides pitched in , she said			0
@entity136 has lived in @entity0 his entire life			2
he has sandbagged his home , located just outside the evacuation zone , with the help of neighbors , and said sunday it was dry so far			0
he was , however , very concerned about the water			0
" i flushed my toilet this morning , and the water was red , " he said			0
still , he said he was able to see the positives , when neighbors , relatives and friends bond to get through a disaster the best they can			0
@entity2 's @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			2
