@entity0 -- civil rights leaders marking the 47th anniversary of @entity4 's " @entity8 " speech saturday scorned a nearby @entity7 - led rally , saying it came with no message and with a presumption that @entity4 's famous discourse can be used as a conservative platform			1
the rev. @entity14 and a range of activists spoke at the event , which they called " reclaim the dream , " insisting that @entity4 's vision for @entity21 has not been completely fulfilled			1
" do n't let anyone tell you that they have the right to take their country back			0
it 's our country , too , " said @entity28 , executive director of the @entity29 , making a reference to the @entity32 members attending the @entity7 rally at the @entity34			1
" we will reclaim the dream			0
it was ours from the beginning			0
a dream that we will make reality , " she said at the @entity42 rally in northwest @entity0 people at @entity46 stood shoulder to shoulder , filling half of a high school football field and the track around one half of the field			0
they also filled about five sections of the bleachers			0
many of the speakers made numerous references to what @entity21 was like in 1963 , when @entity4 gave his speech			2
" schools all over @entity21 still were segregated and public accommodations housing was segregated and blacks in the @entity64 did n't have the right to vote			0
the march on @entity0 changed all of that			0
@entity7 's march will change nothing			1
but you ca n't blame @entity7 for his ' march on @entity0 ' envy			2
too bad he does n't have a message to match the place or that is worthy of the march , " said rep. @entity73 , @entity74			2
following the rally , @entity14 linked arms with fellow marchers and walked three miles to the site of the future @entity84 , just a few blocks from the @entity34			1
@entity14 and others could n't resist discussing @entity7 's controversial rally on the @entity88			1
@entity7 , who has a program on @entity90 as well as several radio programs , was criticized for holding his event -- which he called " @entity93 " -- where @entity4 delivered his speech august 28 , 1963			1
civil rights leader the rev. @entity95 told @entity1 that @entity7 was mimicking @entity4 and " humiliating the tradition			1
" @entity7 said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of @entity4 , " the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone 's right to have a dream			1
" " they may have the @entity88 , " countered @entity14 , " but we have the message			2
they may have the platform but we have the dream			0
" " this is our day and we ai n't giving it away , " said @entity14 , who reminded the crowd that much civil rights progress has been seen in the last several decades but more needs to be made			1
@entity14 told @entity1 's @entity116 on saturday night that @entity7 's rally was n't appropriate for a day when people reflect on @entity4 's policy message			1
" whose civil rights agenda did he lay out ? it was a motivational speech , " @entity14 said of @entity7			1
" it might be good , but it 's not civil rights			1
" earlier saturday , @entity14 noted that in 1963 , african - americans had to sit in the back of buses and could n't check into segregated hotels			2
now , he said , people flew in to the event first class and can use public accommodations			0
and most significantly , he noted , the president of the @entity21 is an @entity135			0
@entity14 also said that more progress needs to be made in education , criminal justice and other issues , such as statehood for the @entity74 , which has a large black population			2
" we 're not there yet , " he said			0
education secretary @entity144 , who also spoke at the event , called education " the civil rights issue of our generation			1
" he said it 's time to stop being complacent about education and demand excellence			0
@entity14 said the conservatives who rallied at the @entity34 should ask president @entity153 himself why he led the fight against states ' rights during the @entity156 to hold the union together			1
he urged the people there to read @entity4 's speech and talk to people who endured discrimination in their lives			1
@entity14 warned conservative forces they 'd face a fight in the upcoming elections , and called on people to turn out to vote this year as they did in 2008 , when @entity168 was elected			0
" we 're coming out to fight and we 're not going to let you turn back the clock , " he said			0
other well - known public figures spoke , including @entity174 president and ceo @entity175 , who said , " we will not stand silent as some seek to hijack , as some seek to distort and contort , as some seek to bamboozle and confuse the vision of dr. @entity4 's dream			2
" @entity182 president @entity181 indicated that @entity4 was treated respectfully by the conservatives			2
" i am delighted to know that mr. @entity7 and his colleagues discovered the ' @entity8 ' speech , " he said			2
but , he added , @entity7 needs to travel to @entity182 , the @entity188 college @entity4 attended , to learn what @entity4 studied -- citing , for example , the works of religious thinkers who influenced the late civil rights leader			1
a couple of speakers also noted the passing of @entity198 earlier this year			0
height , a civil rights pioneer , had been chair and president emeritus of the @entity29 and was on the podium with @entity4 during the 1963 speech			1
the " @entity8 " speech -- delivered on the steps of the @entity34 -- served as a symbol of the fight against racial discrimination			0
it was made during the @entity210 , and is considered one of the most pivotal and memorable of @entity21 speeches			0
@entity1 's @entity213 contributed to this report .			0
