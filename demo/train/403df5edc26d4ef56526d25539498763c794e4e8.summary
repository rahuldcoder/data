-- lately it 's hard to tell the difference between a presidential debate and " the @entity4			1
" yeah , i know			2
some of you have been saying this for months			2
but my comment is n't a criticism of the candidates , but the live audience			2
i was hoping this audience " whoop " factor would go away over the long debate season , but it has only grown worse			1
are they serving alcohol at the debates ? it seems like it			2
in last night 's @entity23 presidential debate , held in the @entity24 in @entity25 , the chaotic audience once again played an awkward role in the questions and answers			1
why does this matter ? on these presidential debates , the vocal live audiences have shown themselves to be more disruptive than productive			1
and i 've seen debate judges ( people who should know better ) in intercollegiate tournaments have their decisions influenced by a noisy audience â € ” even judges trained to be impartial and objective			1
in this case , the judges are you , the audience			0
i know everyone believes they ca n't be swayed like this , but it still happens ( even to me , which is one of the reasons i watch the presidential debates alone			1
i do n't want anyone influencing my analysis )			0
there is even a name for it in the literature			0
and it was apparent monday night -- fanboys ( and fangirls ) who were every bit as rabid as a football crowd			0
the only people missing were face - paint girl and shirtless guy			0
( of course , it 's hard to tell on television how much of the crowd participated in the cheering and booing			1
) it was especially annoying because the live audience was booing their disapproval at inappropriate times			0
@entity77 , one of the moderators , was asking @entity79 about his immigration policies when he was interrupted in mid-question			1
@entity77 had begun the question by stating that @entity79 's father was born in @entity84			1
" @entity87 " came the shouts from the audience			0
what ? what in the world were they booing ? i still have no idea			0
it could have been @entity77 , the question , @entity79 's father , or @entity79 's position on immigration			1
then the live audience ganged up on @entity102			0
remember , @entity102 has some of the more unconventional foreign policy positions for a conservative @entity23 audience			1
and @entity102 was not at his best last night ( i 've heard him defend his argument much more effectively ) when explaining his position on the military operation that killed @entity108			0
but the audience mistimed its reaction and used most of its vitriol immediately after @entity102 said the @entity115 people would n't like it if the @entity115 were treated the same way it treated other countries			0
@entity102 reiterated his stance that we should use the golden rule -- do unto others as you would have them do unto you -- when the boos rang out			1
i could n't believe it			0
i was indeed hearing this correctly			0
the crazed audience at the presidential debate actually booed the golden - freaking - rule			1
what 's next ? helping old women cross the street ? " @entity133 ... villain ! " puppies ? " @entity134 ... shame ! " and the audience was equally annoying when applauding			1
remember : cheering should prove nothing to you in a debate except that some candidates are better than others at stacking the live audience with supporters			2
i 'm also beginning to wonder if there is an " applause " sign that lights up so some of the slower audience operatives will remember when to react			0
for their part , the candidates handled the live audience pretty well			0
after all , politicians are used to verbal feedback in public speeches and town hall meetings			0
my advice today is for the general viewing public at home			2
simply keep in mind that the opinions of the live audience are not necessarily reflective of anything , including logic			2
and try to resist being influenced by overzealous fools watching the debate from the cheap seats			1
if this continues , we 're in danger of letting the loud few influence the silent many watching at home			1
i certainly hope we can reverse this trend			0
because i 'd hate to see the next step : measuring presidential debates by audience noise - meters with a needle that moves up and down			2
after all , higher decibel levels must indicate better policies			0
join @entity179 on @entity180 and follow updates on @entity182 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			1

@entity185 : @entity23 presidential debate audiences have gotten more and more *raucous*
he says this matters because the boos and cheers can sway viewers ' opinions
@entity134 came for @entity79 's father being born in @entity84 and for the golden rule
@entity185 : if this keeps up we risk letting the loud few influence the silent many watching at home
