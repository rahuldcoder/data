-- what if browsing the internet felt like playing an arcade game ? that 's the idea behind a new website called @entity6 , which awards points -- and potentially real prizes -- to people just for trolling around online			1
the site , which opened to the public late wednesday and launched at a conference hosted by the blog @entity13 earlier this week , intends to apply the idea of " check - ins " to online media consumption			1
smartphone apps like @entity18 and @entity19 popularized the idea of check - ins , which broadly refers to the act of telling people you 're at a certain location or that you 're doing a certain thing at that moment			1
it 's a concept that 's gone mainstream only recently			2
@entity29 , with its 500 million members , picked up on the idea when it launched its " places " feature in august			1
@entity18 and others let users " check in " to bars , restaurants and parks			1
other apps like @entity40 let people check in while they 're watching movies or reading books			1
now those same mechanics are coming to the internet at large			1
after users install a @entity47 plug - in for @entity6 , the site automatically checks you in each time you visit a new website			1
if it 's your first time on the site , you get 10 points ; if you 've been there before , you get 1 point for each new page you visit within a certain domain			2
those who share a link -- on @entity62 , @entity29 or @entity63 , the bookmarking site -- are awarded with five points			2
people whose links actually drive traffic back to that website get one point for each click			0
the scores reset every two weeks			0
but who cares , right ? what do these points actually mean ? @entity76 , who co-founded @entity6 with business partner @entity77 , says the points create a sense of competition and community among users and could also result in real prizes			1
those who visit a certain site most often are given " @entity92 " status , similar to the " mayor " status people achieve on @entity18 if they frequent a certain venue more often than anyone			0
people who have installed the @entity6 plug - in automatically see who is winning the race to be the biggest fan of that page			1
the also see the faces of other internet heads who happen to be look at the page at that time			1
@entity76 says this creates an ambient feeling of community -- much the way shopping in a crowded store makes a person feel part of a group			0
" when you think about it , browsing the @entity109 is an inherently sterile , isolated experience , but there are people at the same sites you go to , " he said			0
" and it 's not like you 're going to sit there and talk to them while you 're browsing			2
" instead , he added , it 's nice just to know they 're there			2
the site awards digital " patches " to people who complete certain challenges			0
for instance , if a person visits 1,000 different internet domains , he or she is awarded the " browser " patch			2
sharing 100 links gets you the " broadcast " patch , and visiting five social networking sites in one day gets you the " socialite " patch			1
all of this feeds into the competitive spirit of the site , @entity76 said			0
@entity6 does not let users contact each other through the site , but the service links in with peoples ' @entity62 and @entity29 accounts , so users could get in touch that way if they wanted , he said			1
and as for the sites you 'd rather the world not see that you visited ? users can undo check - ins on a particular site and their entire check - in history there will be deleted from @entity6 's servers permanently , @entity76 said			1
the site does not save its users ' entire browsing histories , he said			0
it only lists links that users have shared publicly on @entity29 , @entity62 and @entity63 -- as well as whether a person gained or lost " @entity92 " status on a website			0
as for the real rewards , some stores give freebies or discounts to people who become mayors of locations on @entity18			0
in much the same way , web companies will be able to offer prizes to the people who achieve " @entity92 " status on their sites , @entity76 said			0
for example , a tech - focused website might offer the top user a free @entity183 or a chance to preview an invitation - only site , he said			0
@entity76 believes his plug - in makes the @entity109 more social and fun			0
it 's part of the coming " gamification " of our lives			2
@entity6 only had 700 " alpha " users as of wednesday , before it launched to the public , he said			1
those users had to request invitations to get an " alpha preview " of the new website			0
it 's not the only new site trying to push the idea of website - based check - ins			1
@entity204 , which was a finalist in a contest for innovative startup companies at the @entity209 event this week , aims to work with media companies to develop loyal website users using similar techniques			1
" the @entity215 offers turnkey widgets & an api that allow media sites , publishers , brands , marketers , and community managers to leverage game - based techniques to create highly engaging web experiences , " the site says in an introductory blog post			0
" users are rewarded with real - time achievements and reputation that help publishers achieve specific pre-defined and measurable business goals			0
" @entity231 and @entity13 are among @entity204 's current customers , according to a press release about the company			1
@entity235 is another company trying to sell game - like features to websites			1
it 's unclear , however , how users will react to these new services			0
in a post on the blog @entity245 , @entity242 says that the new sites that are adding " game mechanics " to websites are doing a better job than their predecessors , but that adding games to web browsing can go terribly wrong			2
" bad game mechanics are worse than no game mechanic because of that one jarring moment when your user realizes just how crappy the game mechanic is , " he writes			0
" and it 's at that moment when you have absolutely no control over where their mind wanders off to			0
they are flying free and you 're just a speck on the radar			2
" he adds : " this is going to get nutty , and awesome , very quickly			0

the idea of the " check in " is coming to the internet
the term once referred to the idea of telling friends where you are
now it applies to sharing the websites you 're visiting
@entity6 , @entity204 and @entity235 are among those competing
