-- as many as 175 enemy troops killed , 18 wounds from enemy fire , 38 hours of battle , 48 hours evading the @entity6 troops in the bush -- and one tiger			1
those are the numbers behind sgt. maj. @entity10 , an award he received from president @entity12 in a @entity14 ceremony monday			1
@entity15 of @entity16 , @entity17 , was honored for his actions in @entity20 's @entity19 more than 48 years ago			1
then a 32 - year - old sergeant first class , @entity15 was among a handful of @entity23 working with troops of the @entity25 at @entity26 when the camp was attacked by a large @entity6 and @entity29 force on march 9 , 1966 , according to an @entity31 report			1
" @entity15 rushed through intense enemy fire and manned a mortar position defending the camp , " the @entity31 report says			1
" he continued to mount a defense even while incurring wounds from several direct hits from enemy mortars			0
upon learning that several soldiers were wounded near the center of camp , he temporarily turned the mortar over to another soldier , ran through exploding mortar rounds and dragged several comrades to safety			2
as the hostile fire subsided , @entity15 exposed himself to sporadic sniper fire and carried his wounded comrades to a more secure position			1
" later , under enemy fire , some of it coming from @entity57 allies who had defected to the @entity6 during the battle , @entity15 took wounded troops to an airstrip outside the camp for evacuation and drew enemy fire away from the evacuation aircraft			1
he went outside the camp again to retrieve supplies from an airdrop that fell into a minefield			0
and that was just day one			0
" the bottom line is that it was just not my day to go , " @entity15 said in an @entity31 interview at @entity73 , @entity74 , last week			1
the fighting , and @entity15 ' heroism , continued in the early morning of march 10 when the @entity6 hit the camp with their main attack , according to the @entity31 report			1
" within two hours , sergeant @entity15 was the only defender firing a mortar weapon			1
when all mortar rounds were expended , @entity15 began placing effective rifle fire upon enemy as they infiltrated the camp perimeter and assaulted his position			2
despite receiving additional wounds from enemy rounds exploding on his position , @entity15 fought off relentless waves of attacking @entity6 soldiers , " the @entity31 report says			1
after falling back to a smaller bunker in @entity26 , @entity15 killed more enemy troops with small arms fire , destroyed equipment and classified documents to prevent them from getting into @entity6 hands , and led a group of soldiers in digging their way out of the rear of the bunker and escaping the besieged camp			1
but @entity15 ' ordeal was not over			2
because he was carrying a wounded comrade , he and his small group could n't get to the evacuation helicopters sent to pick up the battle 's survivors			2
the band faded into the jungle , avoiding their @entity6 pursuers for 48 hours			1
and that 's where the tiger comes in			0
" the @entity6 soldiers had us surrounded on a little hilltop and everything started getting kind of quiet , " @entity15 is quoted as saying in an @entity31 report			1
" we could look around and all at once , all we could see were eyes going around us			0
it was a tiger that stalked us that night			0
we were all bloody and in this jungle , the tiger stalked us and the @entity6 soldiers were more afraid of the tiger than they were of us			2
so , they backed off some and we were ( able to escape )			0
" helicopters rescued @entity15 and the rest of his group on march 12			1
the @entity31 says @entity15 killed 135 to 175 enemy soldiers during the @entity132 battle			1
he suffered 18 wounds during the 86 - hour ordeal			2
forty - eight years later , @entity15 does n't cite those numbers but two others			2
" i 'm just a keeper of the medal for those other 16 ( @entity23 troops ) who were in the battle , especially the five who did n't make it , " he told @entity143			2
" i can tell you every man who was there and the five who lost their lives			0
i can tell you how that happened			0
it diminishes , but it does not go away , " @entity15 said			2
and he remembers the @entity57 who stuck by his side			0
" there were about 410 indigenous @entity25 soldiers there with us , and of those , only about 122 survived , and most of those were wounded			0
it was a horrible , horrible battle			0
there was valor on all sides , not only from the @entity23 , but from the @entity25 soldiers also , " he 's quoted as saying in an @entity31 report			0
others to receive honor honored with @entity15 at the @entity14 ceremony was one other soldier , posthumously			1
spc. @entity172 was awarded the @entity173 for his actions in using his body to shield comrades from a grenade blast near @entity178 , @entity20 , in january 1970			1
additionally , the @entity14 has announced one more @entity173 recipient : from the @entity185 , 1st lt. @entity181 , who held out against @entity183 troops during @entity184 on july 3 , 1863 , part of the @entity186			0
