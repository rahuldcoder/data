a few hours before @entity0 addressed an audience of around 6,000 people near @entity3 , the former secretary of state did what few people looking to sell a book would do : she toured a plastics factory			0
@entity10 aides say the event was tied to her family 's foundation -- the @entity15 -- and the fact that its annual meeting will be held in @entity3 later this month			1
but the optics of the event said something different			0
after touring the factory and giving short remarks about the power of @entity23 business -- " i am convinced that @entity23 businesses can compete and win against anybody anywhere if we are at the top of our game , " she said -- @entity10 stepped off the stage and headed to a rope line of eager factory workers and camera - toting employees			2
" let me shake a few more hands , " @entity10 said , a comment reminiscent of refrains made by @entity39 - or @entity40 - bound politicians			2
in the last month , these two facts have been evident : clinton - land wants you to know she has a memoir -- " @entity47 " -- coming out on june 10 and she has become more open about her presidential ambitions			1
@entity10 discusses @entity49 in book and the two have a lot to do with one another			1
instead of surrounding herself with the regular @entity56 flacks and publicists in preparation to sell her book , @entity10 has brought on seasoned campaign veterans and political communicators			1
sources close to @entity10 are talking about " war rooms " and " surrogate operations " instead of book signings			2
@entity10 to take part in @entity69 town hall as book launches " this is a very well orchestrated roll out that is going to make the book have far more impact and , yes , will add to her sense of candidacy , " said @entity71 , a senior political analyst with @entity69 who has deep connections with the @entity73			2
" i think what you will see with her over the next year until she makes a firm decision is an occasional set of events like this that will keep her fresh , allow her to say her piece			0
" ' a very professional operation ' in addition to helping @entity10 , the hypothetical candidate , @entity71 said the book rollout will help her staff			1
" it gives them a sense of what a political campaign feels like , " he said			0
" i do n't think she has made her final call yet , but she is clearly laying the groundwork in a way that suggests a very professional operation			0
" earlier this year , the former senator was also more measured in her remarks and more sheepish when answering questions about 2016			0
in january , @entity10 told an audience in @entity109 that she " was n't thinking about " running and that she has " tried to get other people not to think about it			0
" in @entity112 , she shrugged when asked about 2016 and walked off stage to a chorus of laughs			0
in @entity116 , she commended the way the question was asked , but failed to actually answer it			0
fast - forward to june and @entity10 was more openly talking about the worst - kept - secret in @entity121 : she is thinking about running for president			0
in an interview with @entity124 that was part of the book rollout , @entity10 said she knows she has " a decision to make " on 2016 and that she will " just have to make my own decision about what i think is right for me			1
" in her @entity130 speech on monday -- the one after her campaign style tour of the plastics plant -- @entity10 called the presidency " as much a job as it is a mission " and when asked about how difficult it is to run , she remarked that she " luckily " has " a lot of resilience and a lot of stamina			2
" her rhetoric , too , has started to sound more like a campaign			0
at the end of the speech in @entity130 on monday , @entity10 closed with what sounded like an impassioned plea for support and , if the venue was different , for votes			0
" please join me , " she said , her voice raising over the roaring crowd , " in making some hard choices for @entity23			0
" seasoned hands help communicate message with the stepped up rhetoric has come a more robust inner circle of @entity10 aides to tightly and systematically trickle out information about the book			2
once an operation with just a few press staff and advisers - along with dozens of informal friends and longtime confidants - the @entity10 world has added a few seasoned political hands to help communicate @entity10 's message around the book			1
the @entity10 team brought on @entity170 , a @entity171 spokesman during @entity173 's first term , to coordinate and assist in the response to the book and questions about @entity10 's record at the @entity178			1
it has also tapped @entity180 , a former @entity10 senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns , to coordinate the surrogate operation around the book			1
with the new hires comes what one source called a war room of former diplomats who stand ready to respond to criticism of @entity10 's tenure at the @entity178			2
it is safe to say that @entity10 's book roll out is one of the first to use phrases like war room and surrogate operation			1
one of @entity10 's closest advisers - @entity199 - also briefed a group of @entity202 national security experts and communicators last week on the political scrutiny over the @entity206 terror attack and the themes of @entity10 's book			1
the meeting was tightly controlled by @entity10 's advisers , who told attendees that there would be no leaking what was discussed in the briefing			2
outside groups have also begun to step up their activity around the book			0
correct the @entity218 , a @entity220 messaging and rapid response organization with deep ties to @entity10 , hosted media training for their surrogates in may			0
ready for @entity0 , a @entity226 that is building grassroots support for the former first lady , announced on wednesday that they would follow @entity10 's book tour in " the @entity231 , " a mobile venue for the group to sign up supporters and support the pseudo-campaign			1
the groups that have @entity0 's back leaks and excerpts trickle out as her aides have been planning and preparing , @entity10 has been all over the news			2
she appeared on the @entity244 in may - joking that she was " running ... around the park " -- and details about her book have slowly leaked out on a nearly daily basis			0
the first book excerpts came out in early may , when in honor of @entity251 published a passage of @entity10 's book that was dedicated to her mother			1
then came the book 's author 's note , put out by @entity259 , the book 's publisher			0
shortly after that , the most highly anticipated chapter of @entity10 's book - her recollections and thoughts about @entity206 - was leaked to @entity266			1
the speculation was that @entity10 's staff wanted to get the news out of the way early so that it would n't shadow the rest of the book			1
on thursday , @entity273 reported that @entity10 talks about negotiations for captured soldier @entity276 's release and her differences with @entity173 over arming @entity280 rebels in the book , which it said it had gotten a copy of			1
along the way , locations for @entity10 's book tour were released : @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity121 , @entity289 and @entity290 , to name a few			1
if all of this seems reminiscent of a campaign , that 's because it is			0
seasoned staff , effective surrogate operations and coordinated leaks are what can make or break a political campaign			0
and as is evident with @entity10 's stepped up presence and the slow trickle of news about her campaign , @entity10 's book tour appears to be as much a memoir roll out as it is political tune up .			1

@entity10 events look like something from the campaign trail
she 's become more open about her presidential ambitions , although no decision yet
rollout of her book will help her staff prepare for if she decides to go for it
