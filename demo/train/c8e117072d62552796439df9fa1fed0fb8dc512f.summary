@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's orange harvest is nearing its end as workers in the state of @entity7 pluck late - blooming fruit from the trees			2
the yellow - green oranges will be shipped off to nearby juice factories and then shipped around the globe			0
those exports rake in $ 2 billion for @entity1 , the biggest orange juice exporter in the world , accounting for 85 percent of global exports			1
but now , it is not clear if @entity1 orange juice will be allowed into one of its key markets : the @entity22			1
last week , the @entity23 temporarily halted all orange juice imports after low levels of the unapproved fungicide carbendazim were found in some juice shipments from @entity1			1
more recently , the @entity23 said the juice is safe for consumption			0
growers in @entity7 say they have been using carbendazim for some 20 years and point out that it is allowed -- in low levels -- across @entity33 and @entity34			0
it is also allowed in trace amounts in other food products , like nuts , in the @entity22			2
" we did n't even know that it had been banned in orange juice in the @entity22 in 2009 , " @entity39 , a third generation orange grower , told @entity2			1
@entity43 , also the president of the @entity44 at the @entity45 , says there are alternatives , however			0
in fact , he and other growers already rotate the use of carbendazim with other fungicides and techniques for preventing diseases like black spot , which make the oranges fall from the trees before they are ripe			0
he says @entity1 growers do n't want to lose the @entity22 market , which is their second biggest after @entity33			1
the @entity22 currently buys 15 percent of @entity61 orange juice exports			1
" if we have to , we 'll eliminate this product completely , " he said as he walked , showing off his 60 - acre grove			0
" we want to supply the @entity22 market , we do n't in any way want to lose it			2
we can adapt to the @entity22 system with other products			1
" growers here would take a hit if this latest crop were barred from @entity34			0
global orange juice prices would rise , too			2
but @entity43 says producers can adapt quickly and could produce the next crop carbendazim - free if it were necessary			0
while @entity1 farmers and industry leaders do n't see a threat to consumers ' health , they say the most important thing is that people are n't afraid to drink orange juice .			1
