editor 's note : @entity2 has worked as a staffer for former house speaker @entity4 and other @entity5 in @entity6			1
he is president of @entity7 , a @entity8 - based advocacy firm that has represented clients including @entity10 , @entity11 and the @entity12			1
he formerly was a government relations executive vice president for the @entity13			2
@entity2 says the way to oppose president @entity15 is with new ideas , not with rhetoric			1
( @entity18 ) -- as i watched president @entity15 conduct a town hall meeting in @entity22 , @entity23 , the other day , a chilling realization crossed my mind : i like the guy			1
this might be a surprise coming from a partisan @entity5 who also does some work as a lobbyist			1
( @entity15 seems to dislike my profession with special intensity			1
) but it should n't be			2
there is much to like about him			0
he has a winning smile			2
he is unself - consciously hip			0
he has self - confidence without being overly smug			0
he has married well and has two " perfect " daughters ( his words , not mine )			0
@entity15 also has an inspiring life story , and his election to the highest office in the world represents the best possibilities of the @entity49 dream			1
i also want @entity15 to succeed			1
unlike @entity68 , if @entity15 can get my 401 ( k ) back to life , if he can get health care costs under control , if he can stop pollution , if he can get the manufacturing sector back on its feet , if he can make our country more secure while regaining for @entity49 the moral high ground , if he can find the cure for cancer and bring peace , love and understanding to the world , i am all for it			1
i am also willing to pay a few extra bucks in taxes for that success , if i can get some economic growth in return			0
and i am not alone in my feelings			0
@entity15 's personal approval ratings are still high , and most @entity49 simply love his family			1
internationally , the president 's ratings are off the chart			2
so , how do i square my approval of the president personally with my disapproval of his policies ? how can i like @entity15 but not the @entity15 @entity85 ? for example , i think the president 's budget will lead to inflation or even possible bankruptcy for the nation			1
i understand the difficult choices that he has tried to make , and i understand the desire to get everything done right now			0
but governing is about choosing , and the system ca n't do everything at once			2
i also disagree with his attack on the lobbying profession			0
lobbying the government is protected under the @entity101 , because what lobbyists do is petition their government on behalf of the people			0
are there some lobbyists who are corrupt or crooked ? sure there are			0
but most lobbyists , like most politicians , do it the right way , and they serve a vital function of providing expertise to both the private sector and to the public sector			0
philosophically , i do n't agree with the president			1
he is a collectivist , where i believe more in individual responsibility			0
he is a @entity121 , where i am a supply - sider			0
but i still like him			0
and i think many of my fellow republicans on @entity126 are stuck in the same trap			0
they like the man , but do n't like the policies			1
they hope , for the sake of the country , that he is successful , but have their real doubts that his policies will work			2
and because they are the loyal opposition , they are stuck , in this 24 - hour cable news and talk radio culture , saying things about him that make them seem shrill and out of touch			0
what makes it worse is that , according to the polls , @entity49 have much more faith in @entity15 and the @entity148 now than they do in the @entity5			1
here are some suggestions about how @entity5 can square the circle , how they can express their admiration for the man and even some of the goals of this administration , without rolling over on the policy front : 1 ) accept every social invitation from the president			1
when he invites you to watch the @entity160 , go the @entity85 and watch the @entity160			0
when he wants to buy you a beer , go ahead and buy him a beer back			0
let the public know that you appreciate their appreciation for the president , and that while you might disagree with him on policy , you like hanging out with him on occasion			2
2 ) never miss an opportunity to compliment the president and his family for something they have done that puts @entity49 in a good light			1
if the first lady represents the country well when she meets the @entity23 premier 's wife , or if the president does a good job talking to students overseas , applaud them			2
do n't look for reasons to pick on things that do n't matter			2
3 ) agree with certain policy goals			0
yes , all children should have access to health care			0
yes , we need to have 21st - century schools			0
yes , we should have clean water and clean air			0
yes , we need to create more jobs			0
we may have a different approach , but we agree with the goals to make @entity49 a better place to live			0
4 ) create and then market your own ideas			2
the key to beating @entity15 is not by vilifying him ( in my opinion )			1
the key to beating @entity15 is in coming up with superior ideas to transform the government and to make @entity49 a better place to live			1
republicans should come up with plans that insist on transformational change of the government bureaucracy , that require greater accountability from failing school districts , that target the high costs caused by frivolous medical lawsuits , that highlight job - killing union contracts and that insist on total transparency in government spending			0
reacting to the president 's proposals puts republicans in a tough spot			2
having the president react to our proposals puts him on the defensive			2
some will say that this " play nice " strategy will backfire on @entity5 ; that the only way to beat @entity15 is to stoke fear and attack his character			1
others will accuse me of going soft on a @entity236 who quite clearly does n't share the values of most republicans			2
but i think there is far greater risk for the @entity5 brand in not acknowledging what @entity15 's election means historically , and not appreciating how his example is not only good for @entity148 but for the country at large			1
tearing this president down is not the way for @entity5 to regain a majority coalition , although some pundits and talk show hosts will be tempted to do just that			1
instead , @entity5 should allow themselves to like the president , just as they fight against his policies			1
and as they fight his policies , they should do all that they can to market their own ideas so that the @entity49 people understand that the @entity5 have positive alternatives that will make our country stronger , safer and more prosperous in the future			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : most americans like @entity15 and his family
he says he wants @entity15 to succeed but opposes his policies
@entity2 says the way to oppose @entity15 is not with rhetoric , but with ideas
he says tearing the president down wo n't get the @entity5 a winning coalition
