@entity0 , @entity1 -- the outcome of the election of 2012 is becoming even tougher to predict , since there are many political landmines facing both parties			0
president @entity8 has enjoyed a resurgence in his political standing , with polls showing him ahead of the @entity13 rivals in hypothetical matchups for the general election			1
recent statistics showing an improving economy have bolstered the president 's position , while his budget proposal and increasingly populist rhetoric have generated some excitement within the base of the @entity24			0
on the @entity13 side , @entity25 remains the front - runner , though barely , still enjoying the kind of edge in campaign contributions that is essential to victory			1
yet both candidates , and both parties , are confronting threats that could cause huge swings in the outcome of the election			0
the @entity24 challenges come from outside the party			0
for @entity8 , the biggest threat is @entity40			1
even though leaders have put bailout plans in place and nations have started to grapple with their budget problems , the governments of @entity42 , @entity43 and other nations remain fiscally unstable			0
if any of these countries should default , they could trigger the kind of financial chaos in world markets that could doom @entity8 's re-election bid			1
the problem for the @entity56 is that there are limits to what the @entity59 can do other than watch as @entity40 governments struggle to resolve this collective problem			1
another lurking problem is @entity64			0
as tensions keep escalating with the @entity64 government , and between the @entity70 and @entity64 , the potential for an international crisis is clear			1
if the situation deteriorates , the politics could move in ether direction			0
on the one hand , there could be a rally - around - the - leader effect , bolstering the case for keeping @entity8 in office			1
or it could open the president up to attack from the right if his handling of the crisis is questionable			0
the administration must also wait to see what the @entity87 decides on the president 's health care plan			1
the court is expected to decide by early summer on the constitutionality of mandating that people must have health insurance			1
if it decides that the individual mandate is constitutional , the decision would greatly strengthen the president 's political position			0
but if the @entity87 says this key portion of the plan is unconstitutional , the decision would lend support to republicans who have criticized the president for expanding the role of government			0
even if a negative decision energized the base of the @entity24 , dismantling @entity8 's key policy accomplishment would be devastating to the @entity56			1
@entity13 face huge threats as well			1
continued improvement in the economy would undercut @entity13 criticism about how the president has handled the marketplace			1
but the most difficult threat for the @entity13 comes from within the party			1
republicans are now engaged in a brutal , fratricidal war			0
few anticipated the effect that @entity122 would have in this contest			0
for years , @entity24 were known as the party unable to control its internal feuding			2
republicans typically gave the nomination to the person who had waited patiently in line , while @entity24 acted like a dysfunctional family that was just as eager to destroy itself as they were to take on their @entity13 opponents			2
this year , @entity133 and @entity134 have thrown a wrench into the @entity13 machine			2
although some commentators focus on @entity133 's background as a professor , what is equally important is @entity133 the ruthless politician , who takes no prisoners and persists in battle until he no longer can			0
despite all the warnings that he has faced about the impact of his take - no - prisoners campaign against @entity25 , @entity133 has continued to launch political attacks on the @entity13 front - runner			2
@entity134 has joined him in further wounding the former @entity152 governor			0
@entity25 , once seen as the most electable @entity13 , has seen his image transformed into a flip - flopping , liberal , vulture capitalist who might not even win in his own home state of @entity158			2
the outcome of @entity160 and @entity161 contradicted the claim that he is the candidate who inevitably wins			0
@entity134 and @entity133 have effectively painted @entity25 as the " establishment @entity13 " despite the fact that they have been central to the party 's leadership since the 1990s			1
given the current delegate count , and possible victories by @entity133 in @entity170 and @entity134 in @entity158 , @entity13 could be looking at a messy convention where these battles and tensions play out just before the fall campaign			2
the @entity13 could face the kind of raucous convention that @entity24 suffered through in 1968 when internal divisions brought down the party and gave @entity179 a commanding edge in the general election			1
the situation is so unstable that the notion of a new candidate such as @entity185 or @entity186 entering the mix is no longer impossible -- a throwback to the smoke - filled - room era of party politics where decisions were made at the convention			2
nor can we rule out the chance of a third - party run that would siphon off @entity13 votes			1
the uncertainty of the contest is likely to make for an extremely bruising campaign this fall , one that could leave both sides deeply wounded and generate even more bitter feelings within two parties whose members already detest each other			0
in short , we 're likely to face a campaign where events will continue to create the possibility of huge swings , dramatic twists and turns and rapid changes in the fortunes of all the candidates			2
