editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- cloning has been a controversial issue since @entity22 embryologist @entity21 first made a pair of adorable , genetically identical salamander twins out of a single egg , way back in nineteen - dickety - two			0
from tales of deformed baby animals to abnormally aging sheep , the idea of using science to duplicate and generally screw with our genetic material continues to creep out the public to this day			0
in order to put a heart - stake in this perennial bugaboo , we traveled to @entity37 to visit with dr. @entity38 , a leading researcher and authority on in - vitro fertilization , and the man responsible for the world 's first cloned cat , which currently lives in his back yard			1
having grown up on a dairy farm in @entity46 , @entity38 left for school intending to learn animal husbandry and take over the family business			1
once he commenced his studies , however , he quickly became engaged in the world of assisted reproduction and left the farming industry -- though only partially			0
he is now a director of the @entity54 at @entity55 , where he also works in the @entity56			0
considered a leader in reproductive science , @entity38 was the first scientist to successfully transfer nonhuman embryos resulting in offspring			1
@entity38 is currently working on a project to genetically engineer livestock resistant to disease			1
while some folks may ( and certainly do ) take issue with this endeavor , @entity38 's view is that his work is no different from using selective breeding to produce superior animals			1
@entity38 approaches cloning from the perspective of someone who has worked in agriculture and who knows the hardship of having a bull who ca n't reproduce			1
but now he 's armed with the technology to circumvent the problem			0
see the rest of @entity82 at @entity9 during the visit , we were introduced to a few of his cloned animals : @entity87 , the first of his cloned deer ; @entity90 , a bull created from the 15 - year - old cells of a dead bull who 'd been resistant to brucellosis , a bacterial infection that causes spontaneous abortion in cattle ; and @entity99 , or @entity99 , the world 's first cloned cat , who has successfully given birth to several kittens of her own			1
cloning and genetic tinkering both raise a slew of questions that none of us can answer			2
after shooting this piece , we 're not sure we see any real difference between the " cloning " @entity38 works on and most forms of artificial insemination and selective breeding			2
while the technological aspect allows for quicker and more direct manipulation , at the end of the day , if you can raise a herd of cows resistant to something as nasty as brucellosis , why would n't you do that ? that said , cloning your household pets so that you can have them forever is still pretty silly .			0
