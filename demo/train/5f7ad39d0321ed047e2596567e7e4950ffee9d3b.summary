-- @entity1 took a giant step toward wresting the @entity4 title off @entity5 after @entity6 scored twice in saturday 's 3 - 0 derby victory at the @entity8 , which ended with both teams reduced to 10 men			1
@entity5 's reign stretches back to the 2005 - 06 season , but the second - placed @entity5 -- coached by former @entity1 boss @entity13 -- now trail the @entity1 by five points with seven games to play			1
@entity16 scored the winner against his former team when @entity1 beat @entity5 in november , but his suspension meant that @entity6 led the attack along with fellow @entity22 @entity21			1
and the 21 - year - old gave @entity1 -- whose last league crown came in 2004 -- the lead after only 44 seconds			0
he played a one - two with @entity26 on the edge of the @entity5 area but the veteran midfielder 's attempted return pass went into the path of the onrushing @entity21 , and @entity6 pounced on the loose ball to beat compatriot goalkeeper @entity34			2
@entity34 was almost beaten again seven minutes before halftime , but @entity37 's deflected shot looped onto the top of the bar and to safety			0
@entity5 should have equalized two minutes before the break , but top scorer @entity42 made an uncharacteristic miss as he scuffed his shot wide of the goal			0
his team 's hopes of gaining parity suffered a huge blow nine minutes after the interval when last man @entity51 was sent off for clipping the heels of @entity6 as the forward burst towards @entity34 's goal			2
@entity6 , playing in his first @entity1 derby , doubled the lead in the 62nd minute when he headed home from @entity60 's mishit shot after the right - back was put in space by @entity63			1
@entity1 had the ball in the net for a third time in the 76th minute , but second - half substitute @entity67 -- who replaced @entity26 -- had clearly strayed offside			0
but another goal inevitably came , with substitute @entity69 scoring from the penalty spot after being dragged down by @entity71 -- his third since joining from @entity73 in the january transfer window			1
but the former @entity75 forward ruined his own night by getting booked twice within a minute -- the first for taking his shirt off to celebrate his goal and the second for a poorly - timed tackle on substitute @entity80			0
the result means @entity5 will lose second spot if @entity83 win at home to fifth - placed @entity85 on sunday			2
@entity5 still hold a 64 - 60 advantage in the 176 meetings between the bitter rivals , but must now recover for tuesday 's opening home leg of the @entity91 quarterfinal against @entity93 club @entity92			0
in saturday 's other match , @entity94 moved out of the relegation zone on goal difference above @entity98 with a 3 - 1 win at home to 10th - placed @entity101 .			1

@entity1 move five points clear of second - placed champions @entity5 with 3 - 0 derby win
*striker* @entity6 scores first two goals as @entity5 's @entity51 is sent off
substitute @entity69 nets third from penalty spot but is then booked twice
@entity94 out of the relegation zone on goal difference after a 3 - 1 win at home to @entity101
