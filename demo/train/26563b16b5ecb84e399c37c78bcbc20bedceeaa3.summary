-- days of sipping umbrella drinks have given way to the stench of backed - up sewage , stuffy cabins without power and limited food			0
the @entity9 engine fire shows that the best - laid cruise plans can veer terribly off course			1
sometimes it 's rough waters forcing the ship 's captain to change or skip a port of call at the last minute			0
and then there are the extreme cases of a days - long stranding , or in the case of the @entity22 disaster , the loss of 32 lives			2
when accidents happen , it 's not always clear what the cruise line is required to do next			1
here are five things we 've learned about cruises since the @entity9 's engine room caught fire on sunday : emergency systems are n't designed for a pleasant trip it 's unclear at this point what systems are in play aboard the @entity9 , but we know that generators are supplying power			1
and from passengers ' grim reports , these emergency measures do not a fun vacation make			2
" the emergency generator is sized to provide sufficient power for systems that are necessary for the survivability of the vessel , passengers and crew , " according to marine engineer @entity54 , who is the chair of the engineering technology department at @entity57			1
opinion : dirty secrets below deck the plumbing systems on the ship are powered by electricity , and passenger accounts of sloshing sewage indicate that there 's not enough to operate facilities for more than 4,000 passengers and crew			1
" since the incident happened on sunday , technicians have managed to restore limited power on board to operate some toilets and limited functions in certain areas			0
there is running water , albeit cold water , " @entity9 spokesman @entity77 said via e-mail			2
a @entity83 helicopter delivered an additional generator to the ship on wednesday to supply more power			0
how @entity9 can clean up the pr mess itineraries can change without notice cruise lines may change a ship 's course mid-voyage			1
in the case of an engine fire , that 's a given , but more routine sailings could also change			2
diversions may mean changing a port of call or skipping it altogether , and passengers agree to the unexpected when they purchase tickets			0
the conditions are included in the cruise line 's ticket contract			1
carnival ships can " deviate in any direction or for any purpose from the direct or usual course , and to omit or change any or all port calls , arrival or departure times , with or without notice , for any reason whatsoever , " including mechanical breakdowns , according to the cruise line 's ticket contract			1
while terms and language vary by cruise line , according to @entity124 , senior editor at online cruise community @entity125 , " it 's pretty standard legalese across the industry that aims to protect the line against every contingency			1
" this week @entity9 sister ships @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 all diverted to provide provisions to @entity9			2
however , those diversions did not result in any delayed arrivals or skipped ports of call , @entity77 said			0
tears and big hugs as passengers reunite with families passenger compensation often is not required itinerary changes after a ship departs are considered part of the " proposed voyage , " according to @entity9 's itinerary change policy			1
under the policy , @entity9 is not liable for refunds or damages for post-departure changes			2
but when more than 3,000 passengers are stranded for five days , the cruise line is willing to concede a failed voyage			1
@entity9 passengers will get $ 500 in addition to a full refund for the cruise and most expenses on board , transportation expenses to get home , as well as a credit for another cruise , @entity9 said			1
even in much less dire situations , most cruise lines do offer prorated compensation for cruises that are cut short , @entity124 said			0
" after that , there 's significant variability in compensation , event by event , " he said			0
after a bad cruise , can you cruise into court ? cruise ship inspections vary by ship and country in addition to the regulations of the @entity181 , a @entity182 agency , a ship is subject to the laws of the country whose flag it flies			0
the ship may also be subject to the laws of a country where it stops			0
the @entity9 sails under a @entity191 flag , so authorities there are taking the lead in investigating the incident			2
but because the @entity9 stops in @entity197 ports and carries @entity197 passengers , the @entity83 has some inspection oversight over the vessel			1
the @entity83 issued a certificate of compliance for the @entity9 on may 17 , 2012 , after the ship 's annual inspection			1
the @entity83 and the @entity205 have also launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire			0
in contrast , the @entity22 , which ran aground and sank off the coast of @entity210 in january 2012 , did n't stop in @entity197 ports carrying @entity197 passengers , so it was n't subject to @entity83 regulation			0
why did the rescue take five days ? passengers may have a legal case @entity9 's ticket contract says the cruise line is not " liable to the passenger for damages for emotional distress , mental suffering / anguish or psychological injury of any kind under any circumstances , except when such damages were caused by the negligence of @entity9 and resulted from the same passenger sustaining actual physical injury , or having been at risk of actual physical injury			1
" while no physical injuries have been reported , if a passenger contracted a significant disease , such as hepatitis , from unsanitary conditions on the ship , maritime trial attorney @entity234 ( @entity233 ) @entity232 believes physical injury could be argued			0
" i think that a case can be made that everyone on that ship is at risk of actual physical injury , " he said			0
will passengers file suit and can they win ? yes and yes , @entity232 said			0
@entity9 's contract prohibits a class action suit , but @entity232 said he 's not sure whether it is legally enforceable			1
@entity232 has never filed suit over a cruise ship stranding , but he said these circumstances , particularly the reports of sewage on decks , are exceptional			0
" it 's a public health disaster in the making			0
" my celebration trip on the @entity9 : from joy to misery @entity0 's @entity259 contributed to this report .			2

emergency systems are n't designed to support 4,000 *people* for five days
a cruise line 's ticket contract protects the company from much liability
