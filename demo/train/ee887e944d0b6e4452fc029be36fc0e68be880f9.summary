with demand up due to the poor economy and toy donations down , @entity10 , the @entity1 ' program that distributes @entity3 toys to children in need , is facing one of its toughest years , according to @entity21 , the @entity23 vice president			1

" every kid deserves a present , " said @entity1 sgt. @entity46 of the @entity10 program in @entity11 , @entity12			1
" right now , we 're not sending out as much as we should be			0
" in the @entity53 area , the @entity1 need to find toys for 82,000 children , but " we are tens of thousands of toys behind , " master sgt @entity51 said			2
if they ca n't fill the need and get every child on the list a toy for @entity3 , @entity51 said , " it 's gon na break my heart			0
" last year , the @entity1 were able to raise $ 13,000 in donations from people at @entity67 , a major commuter hub in downtown @entity53 , but this year the @entity1 will be " lucky to get half that , " staff sgt. @entity64 said			2
