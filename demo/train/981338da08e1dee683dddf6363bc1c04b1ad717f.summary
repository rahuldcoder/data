-- @entity1 scored twice against his former club as @entity3 claimed a 2 - 1 derby triumph over bitter rivals @entity5 in the first leg of the @entity8 semifinal on tuesday night			1
the @entity9 forward , who left @entity5 in acrimonious circumstances after rejecting a new contract at the end of last season , scored in either half to give new manager @entity16 victory over @entity18 in his first derby in charge			1
veteran midfielder @entity21 put @entity5 ahead in the 17th minute at @entity3 's @entity22 with his first goal in a @entity25 derby since 1996 , but @entity1 leveled from the penalty spot three minutes before halftime and headed the winner in the 65th minute			1
@entity16 took off the man of the match with just over 10 minutes to play , and @entity3 had to hold on as @entity5 surged forward in search of a second away goal ahead of the second leg at @entity35 on wednesday next week			1
@entity18 field an almost full - strength team for the first time this season in the tournament , which offers a @entity41 place for the winners , but the continued absence of injured first - choice central defenders @entity45 and @entity46 was apparent in both @entity3 goals			2
fullback @entity49 was ruled to have twice pulled back @entity50 , the second time inside the area and with seemingly little contact made , as the @entity3 striker took advantage of his young opponent 's lack of experience			0
@entity1 blasted the ball into the net for his 12th goal in 11 games despite gamesmanship from his former teammates @entity65 and goalkeeper @entity66 , who was booked for delaying the spot - kick			2
@entity68 and @entity69 were then caught out of position as @entity5 failed to properly clear a corner , allowing @entity1 to dive in with a predatory close - range header from @entity75 's clever hooked cross			1
@entity16 , who left @entity77 star @entity76 on the bench after putting him on and then taking him off again during saturday 's defeat by @entity80 , also had an inexperienced defensive line - up as he started with @entity82			0
the 18 - year - old @entity83 made only his third first - team appearance for @entity3 , and could do nothing as goalkeeper @entity87 's reflex save from @entity65 's close - range flick hit his arm and fell into the path of @entity21 , who made no mistake to put @entity5 ahead			1
@entity82 then got in the way of a goal - bound header from central defensive partner @entity95 later in the first half , and looked a distraught figure when he was finally substituted in the 77th minute			0
his replacement @entity99 made a vital contribution as @entity5 peppered the @entity3 goal , clearing @entity5 substitute @entity102 's scuffed shot off the line with given grounded after doing well to deny @entity65			0
given tipped over another @entity65 effort after the @entity106 striker jinked into the penalty area with ease , and winger @entity109 should have put @entity111 's cross into the net in the 87th minute as he appeared to be distracted by a potential collision with a goalpost -- though replays suggested he was offside anyway			0
in time added on , given again got down well to gather a @entity65 shot which looked destined to hit the woodwork as @entity3 held on for a famous win			0
@entity120 take a 1 - 0 lead into the home second leg of their semifinal against @entity125 this wednesday .			2
