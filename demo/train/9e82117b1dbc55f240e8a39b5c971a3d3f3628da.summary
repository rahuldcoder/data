@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 said a lawsuit accusing it and pope @entity5 of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a catholic school in the @entity9 has no merit			1
" while legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims , this is not one of them , " @entity3 lawyer @entity11 said friday			1
" instead , the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack			0
" the lawsuit by an unnamed @entity23 man demands the @entity3 release the names of thousands of @entity26 priests that the suit says have " credible allegations of sexual misconduct " against them			1
the alleged victim , who is now an adult , says he was molested by the rev. @entity33 while a student at @entity35 for the @entity36 , according to the complaint filed in @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			1
" the defendant , [ the ] @entity3 , has known about the widespread problem of childhood sexual abuse committed by its clergy for centuries , but has covered up that abuse and thereby perpetuated the abuse , " the suit says			2
" the case against the @entity3 and its officials is completely without merit , " @entity48 said			0
" most of the complaint rehashes old theories already rejected by @entity9 courts			0
" @entity48 added , " with regard to @entity33 himself , the @entity3 and its officials knew nothing of his crimes until decades after the abuse occurred , and had no role whatsoever in causing plaintiff 's injuries			2
" @entity5 was named as a defendant because he has the ultimate authority to remove priests and because of his involvement in reviewing sex abuse cases when he was cardinal @entity5 , the suit says			1
@entity70 , @entity71 director of the @entity72 , estimated the @entity3 is investigating 4,000 cases of sex abuse by church employees			2
the lawsuit aims to change church policies and practices that conceal sex offenders , @entity70 said			0
" it 's going to protect children , we hope , around the world , " he said , " this is a historic day and hopefully this is going to result in historic changes			0
" @entity88 , a deaf man who said he was sexually assaulted and raped by @entity33 , stood with @entity70 at a news conference thursday			1
he said the priest " may have stolen our bodies , " but higher clerics such as cardinals , archbishops and the pope " stole our voices			1
" @entity88 , who is not a party to the lawsuit , made his comments in sign language and his daughter , @entity101 , interpreted his words			0
@entity33 , who died in 1998 , is believed to have molested up to 200 boys , @entity70 said			2
the lawsuit said the church " knew that there was a high probability that these clerics would sexually molest more children , but sought to protect itself from scandal , sought to keep its income stream going , at the peril of children			0
" @entity33 , it says , was a " top fundraiser and recruiter " for the church and the " @entity3 wanted to retain @entity33 's services			0
" the same @entity121 law firm representing the @entity23 plaintiff also filed suit wednesday on behalf of a @entity125 resident who says he was sexually abused by a priest			1
the suit alleges @entity26 officials in @entity129 , @entity130 , aided and abetted the abuse by moving the priest to different dioceses as allegations piled up against him			2
@entity2 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0
