-- has our generation become the victim of too much information ? that 's something to ponder as you update your @entity9 status , answer your smartphone , glance at the tv and flip through the morning paper , with the radio blaring in the background			2
bestselling author @entity16 has studied information -- from the invention of scripts and alphabets , to talking drums in @entity22 -- for his new book " @entity23 "			1
" @entity26 , " also written by the former reporter and editor for the @entity29 , helped turn the " @entity25 " into a household phrase			1
@entity16 was also short - listed for the @entity30 for his biographies of @entity32 and @entity33			1
@entity0 recently talked to the author about his latest book and the following is an edited transcript			1
@entity0 : for a nonscientist , how would you answer the question , " what is information ? " and how has that definition changed over history ? @entity16 : luckily , we have the @entity45 to help us			1
unluckily , their definition is now pushing 10,000 words ( as i discuss here )			2
the important change -- really , the impetus for my book -- is that there is a scientific definition			1
it is a mathematical quantity , measured in bits and divorced from any notion of meaning			1
that was new as of the middle of the last century , and we can think of it as the official beginning of the information age			2
but we still need a human definition , too ; now more than ever			2
for us , information includes words and sounds and pictures ; paint on cave walls and ink on paper and smoke signals in the air			2
what is information ? information is how we know			2
@entity0 : your book explains the concept of information using examples from around the world , from ancient history to present day			1
did you develop any favorite cultures or figures as you wrote the book ? @entity16 : i 'm probably not supposed to have a favorite person , but i do			1
i kind of fell in love with @entity91 -- the daughter of the poet and a closet mathematician			0
she is a tragic figure , because she died an early and painful death and because she was a person living in the wrong time : a truly brilliant mathematician whose talents could not have been recognized until a century later			0
@entity0 : you say that technology does not define the information age , that it 's the idea of information itself that 's new			2
can you explain the difference ? @entity16 : it 's tempting to think the @entity104 is about the very visible devices that are all around us , on our desks and in our pockets , profoundly changing the pacing and the flavor of our lives , but technology is just technology			1
what matters is communication -- one - to - many and one - to - one			0
we are aware of information as a big , general thing , but that was n't always the case			0
@entity0 : you talk about an " information flood			0
" do we understand information better today than in our past , or is there just more of it to learn and consume ? @entity16 : both			1
when i started writing the book , seven years ago , the initials @entity129 stood for " transmarginal inhibition " or " @entity131 " or " @entity132			0
" i do n't need to tell you what @entity131 means now ; every teenager knows			0
yet it 's a paradox : how can there be too much information when information is what we want , what we value , what we live for ? we feel deluged -- unable to process it all , unable to find knowledge			0
@entity0 : you 've gone from writing about " chaos " to " @entity23 , " these books feel related , like you 've completed a circle			0
agree , disagree ? @entity16 : agree			1
( with perhaps a question mark on the word " completed			0
" ) it was from chaos theorists , 20 years ago , that i first heard the words " information theory			0
" the connections between chaos and information are many and deep			0
one bridge is the notion of complexity itself			0
how do you measure complexity ? it turns out that the complexity of a system is defined ( and this is not a metaphor ; it is mathematically exact ) by the amount of information it contains			0
@entity0 : any thoughts on what you want to tackle next ? @entity16 : a book ! only next time maybe a small one .			1

@entity16 wrote a new book " the information " about history of information
says scientific definition of information is a mathematical quantity , measured in bits
" @entity26 " author also says that for humans , information is how we know something
@entity16 says the actual communication is more important than devices used to communicate
