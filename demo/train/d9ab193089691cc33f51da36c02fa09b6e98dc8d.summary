@entity9 spoke to students and government officials thursday about the power of free markets at the @entity44 , where @entity45 studied law before embarking on the path to revolution			0
" those of us who oppose the embargo are often accused of excusing or ignoring the @entity3 government 's record on human rights and personal freedom , " @entity9 told the crowd			2
" in fact they need to be addressed by our governments in a constructive and ongoing dialogue			0
" @entity9 praised @entity3 government efforts to attract more international investment and allow more of its citizens to work for themselves but said the island had to go further with its economic reforms			0
