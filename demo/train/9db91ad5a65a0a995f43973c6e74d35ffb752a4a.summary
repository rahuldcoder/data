-- after arriving in @entity2 in 1974 , i lived in a small village near @entity4 s for three years			1
it was here that i realized a lack of basic , life - saving information was causing so much unnecessary illness , tragedy and death : two children in the village were lame from polio ; ordinary wounds became infected and led to hospital stays ; there were many cases of measles ; a baby died from dehydration			0
it was also here that i began to understand why development projects have often failed and why they have even disempowered people at the community level			1
to try a different approach , i partnered with the @entity2 villagers to design and implement a basic education program in @entity30 languages , and in 1991 , i set up a nonprofit organization , @entity32 , to continue that work			1
in this program , people who had never been to school were for the first time able to understand why vaccinations are important , how to treat wounds in the village and how to ensure simple diarrhea does not lead to dehydration and death			2
watch an interview with @entity44 it was not until 1996 , however , that we had a real " breakthrough " ( which is incidentally what @entity32 means in the @entity54 language ) when we added a learning module on human rights and responsibilities to our program			1
by providing a framework of human rights by which women , men and adolescents could discuss new information and issues that were important to them , we saw , for the first time , open dialogue around topics that would have been previously regarded as taboo			1
of course , there are things that are difficult for outsiders to accept			0
i have had to live through the sights and stories of little girls going through female genital cutting , which has led to hemorrhage and even death			0
and you feel outrage when seeing this			0
but with outrage alone , you can maybe save one girl , possibly a few girls			0
you need to understand fully and involve villagers to find a culturally relevant strategy that can reach a critical mass of people who can collectively make such practices disappear			1
and , this is not just about the abandonment of female genital cutting , for which @entity32 is perhaps best known -- more than 6,500 communities in the countries where we work have publicly pledged to abandon this practice as well as child / forced marriage			0
this is about a different approach to development			0
it 's about the social change that can happen when people get access to good information using engaging and participatory methods -- in their own language , designed for and with people who have never been to school , and that facilitates their potential to shape a more promising future for their families and community			1
today , we run a three - year comprehensive nonformal education program in eight countries in @entity30 and in 22 national languages			0
our @entity122 covers topics of immediate relevance to those in rural communities			0
we believe that to make any development initiative successful and sustainable , you need a foundation of education that should be delivered in a manner that is inclusive and leads to dialogue , ideas for taking action for change and positive outcomes			2
this inclusive process also embodies what we frequently talk about as " empathy in development " -- something i feel is often forgotten in the world of development			2
people are shocked by certain harmful practices they hear about in developing countries -- and with good intentions , they translate their outrage into telling people , " this is wrong ! " or " stop this immediately ! " but we are talking about systemic change , and it goes deeper than just telling people what to do			1
over the 22 years that we have been working as an organization , we have had many challenges and made many mistakes			0
consequently , we have learned a great many things , and we are still learning			0
so much of what we do today is based on breakthroughs using knowledge we gained through thoughtful and lengthy discussions in classes or sitting under the neem trees or around a fire late into the night			2
we have learned four key elements that we continue to instill in all our programs			0
first , begin with human rights -- empower people to claim their rights to health and well - being with confidence			1
two , start where people are -- have empathy and respect while you understand their history , their language and culture and their priorities			2
three , do not try to force change -- lay the groundwork for dialogue , introduce people to ideas , identify shared values and allow them to decide what the change will be and when they will make it			1
if you start by just fighting what they are doing , you 're going to get resistance			0
finally , and perhaps most crucially , remember the solutions already exist within the communities with which you work			2
as my village father , @entity197 , a wise religious and traditional leader , once told me , " even if you know what the answer is , and you know what is right , you must let people discover it themselves			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity44 .			1

@entity44 says there were signs of *inadequate* health care when she moved to @entity2
she says real breakthroughs came when villagers were part of the process of change
by talking about human rights , people were drawn into the cause , @entity44 says
solutions ca *n't* be imposed from top down ; people must discover them for themselves , she says
