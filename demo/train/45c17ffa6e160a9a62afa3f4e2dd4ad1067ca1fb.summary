-- @entity2 star @entity1 said friday he is already enjoying the new @entity2 attraction at @entity5 theme park in @entity6 -- and he 's already ridden the thrilling dragon roller coaster five times			1
the star spoke to @entity0 on the opening of the park - within - a - park in @entity12 , with @entity14 towering behind him			1
it 's " pretty amazing , i have to say , " @entity1 said of the castle			1
" it does appear to be kind of 700 ( feet ) of rock and castle			0
my personal favorite thing here is the @entity22			0
... it 's been a while since i 've been on a roller coaster that terrifying , but i 've done it five times in the last two days , and i plan to go a couple more times today			0
" another ride , called @entity2 and the @entity29 , features @entity1 and other stars from the cast and simulates parts of the movie , he said			1
the park is perfect for any fans who want to live parts of the fantastical world of @entity2 , he said			1
@entity1 described seeing " @entity42 " when he was 10 and trying to simulate the movie 's surreal martial arts by running off walls up and down his street			1
at the park , he said , " you are just kind of immersed in the world of @entity45 , the village from the movies			2
for any kids out there who were like me when i was a kid ... you can now just come here and live the movie , pretty much , but without all the danger involved			0
" the attraction re-creates various locations , scenes and other elements from the wildly popular book and movie series			1
@entity2 has now beaten out fellow @entity62 celluloid character @entity61 as the top - grossing film series in history			1
widespread industry speculation has it that @entity5 shelled out about $ 265 million for this @entity2 project , although officials are not confirming that number			1
@entity1 , who turns 21 next month , has played the boy wizard since he was 11 years old -- about half his life			1
the final movie in the series finished filming last saturday , and the opening of the park less than a week later is a nice way to punctuate his time in the role , he said			1
" suddenly , at the end of that , we get to come to an amazing park , " he said			0
" and it is amazing			0
when i was first told it was going to be a @entity2 theme park , i was kind of thinking , well , that can go one of two ways			1
i was slightly trepidacious , because when you have been with something for 10 years , you are desperate -- you do n't want anything to take that legacy			0
" and i promise you that i would not be here today if i did not think this place was absolutely phenomenal , which it really , really is			0
" the @entity2 books have been credited with getting children to start reading again			2
@entity1 said that they have " produced a generation of incredibly thorough , analytical , literate kids " and that the books -- written by @entity102 -- will have that as a legacy for decades			2
@entity1 confessed he was n't one of those young fans of the books at first			2
" i was n't a big reader when i was young , " he said			0
" when i got the part , there was a little bit of a deal made of the fact that the part had n't gone to an avid @entity2 fan			2
" after he got the part , however , @entity1 said he started " dutifully " reading the books , and that 's when he " got completely sucked in and obsessed , " like so many other fans			2
" it 's given me a love of literature and books , " he said			0
with @entity2 nearly behind him , @entity1 said he plans to continue acting , but he 'll be selective about the roles he takes			1
" i 'm in a very , very fortunate position where i 've got a job that i absolutely love , and i get paid incredibly well for it , " he said			0
" i 'm kind of amazingly lucky			0
... and i think if you are in a position where you can afford to pick and choose very carefully what other parts you take and what other films or plays you do , i think you kind of have a duty to , because i 'm in a lucky position where i do n't have to do things just for the money			0
so i 'm going to enjoy being selective for the next few years of my career			0
