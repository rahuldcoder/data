-- the son of a man who died from intestinal problems says he now wonders whether his father 's wife might have poisoned him			1
@entity6 is shown at her booking			0
she is charged with hiring a hit man to kill her husband			0
@entity10 , 76 , was charged by @entity12 authorities last month with one count of solicitation of murder in the july 1986 death of @entity17 , one of her five dead spouses since the 1950s			1
since the arrest , authorities have launched an investigation into the deaths of her previous husbands , including @entity25 , her fifth husband			1
@entity6 's son appeared on " @entity27 " on wednesday along with @entity28 , a news editor with the @entity29 in @entity12			1
" it was n't long after my father married her that he started being sick , " @entity6 said			1
he said he learned of his father 's death when he read it in a local newspaper			1
@entity10 has not been charged in connection with that death or her other three husbands			1
" she has only been charged in one state , " her attorney @entity40 said			0
" i want to remind everybody she has only been charged in @entity12 , and obviously , she is presumed to be innocent			0
there is nothing with the other states because there are no charges at this particular time			0
" here is an edited transcript of the show : @entity6 : you know , actually , murder almost never crossed my mind until the @entity17 case came up			0
in fact , we did not know she was married all this time			1
we just thought that she was married one time and she was a widow lady who married my father			1
well , it was n't long after my father married her that he started being sick and everything			1
and he was never sick a day in his life [ before then ]			1
and i figured something was wrong because he put -- such a wedge became between our families that should n't have existed			0
and the longer she was married to him , the less we had to do with him and the more time it seemed like he was sick but she would n't let us know about it			1
in fact , when he did die , i read about it in the newspaper and did n't even know he was dead			2
and when i went to the funeral home , she already had him cremated			2
grace : had him cremated ? @entity6 : correct			2
grace : mr. @entity25 , what was the cause of death of your father ? @entity6 : well , it 's a complicated thing , and i 'm not very good with these technical terms and all			1
but from what the doctors say , it was some type of stomach and bowel and , you know , intestine problem and everything , which i 've been told later by some people that the symptoms that he had could be caused by arsenic poisoning			0
grace : @entity25 , when you first met her , did n't you tell me you believed at that time she was a widow , a one - time widow that married your father ? @entity6 : right			2
we were told that her husband just passed away , and my mother had passed away a couple years before that			0
and we -- you know , we just figured it was a widow and a widower getting married			2
grace : how did she meet your father ? @entity6 : a friend of his went up there to where she had a salon to get haircutting			0
my father , he went to go up there and get his haircut because i think his barber had retired			0
so he went up there to get his haircut , and that 's where he met her			2
grace : and how long after they met did they marry ? @entity6 : you know , i 'm bad with time frame , but i 'd say , i think within a year or something like that [ 1989 ]			0
... @entity28 , news editor : the information i have is based on an investigation that the @entity145 is running , and information there is that the @entity149 's office and the @entity151 sheriff have gathered evidence from witnesses saying that @entity10 solicited to commit murder to her husband , @entity155			1
@entity156 was shot to death in @entity159 home near the back door inside the home			2
he was found by friends or family members -- i believe friendly members sent there by his employers			0
he did n't report to work			0
... and [ they ] discover him there dead , and then the investigation there ensues but did not lead to anything enough to press charges against anyone			0
. @entity28 , what can you tell me about this woman ? what is her background ? @entity28 : she 's a 76 - year - old widow ... and she 's been married four other times			1
she initially was inviting to family members , but then sort of became more of a wedge in the family and has gone from there , got colder and -- with previous family members .			0
