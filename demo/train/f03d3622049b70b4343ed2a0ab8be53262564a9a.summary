-- @entity1 never really had a chance when dealing with issues of race in @entity5			1
from the moment he ran for office , critics questioned whether he was " black enough " or an " angry black man			0
" as the first @entity12 - @entity12 president of the @entity5 , @entity1 is supposed to prove @entity5 is post-racial , be the president of " all of @entity5 " and show a special empathy for african - americans , all while battling institutional racism but not calling it out			0
while these debates are largely philosophical and symbolic , the nationwide protests in the wake of the non-indictments of police officers responsible for killing @entity21 and @entity22 have shown that race can no longer just be an academic subject for presidents and presidential contenders			1
the crowds marching across @entity5 protesting the ugly intersection of racism , law enforcement and economics are some of the largest , most diverse groups of protesters seen in @entity12 history			2
these issues are going to be laid at the doorstep of all serious 2016 contenders			2
so while many are grappling with the events of the last several months , we 're left to wonder : where 's @entity43 ? we all know that , barring some bizarre unforeseen event , @entity44 is running for president in 2016 , and it 's only a matter of time before she announces			1
she will not march smoothly to the nomination ; there are questions about how much she connects with the middle class , her muddled book rollout this spring and of course , for those who still care , " @entity56			0
" but the most serious problem for @entity58 is the perception that she 's an overly cautious politician who is afraid to take tough stances on anything , especially those issues the @entity64 base might be passionate about			1
and nowhere is this more evident than in her almost utter silence on the recent protest marches across the nation			0
@entity43 took almost 19 days before she said anything about the violence and rioting in @entity72 , @entity73 , and that was after @entity64 and pundits called her out for her silence			1
at the time she said : " imagine what we would feel and what we would do if white drivers were three times as likely to be searched by police during a traffic stop as black drivers instead of the other way around			2
if white offenders received prison sentences 10 % longer than black offenders for the same crimes			0
if a third of all white men -- just look at this room and take one - third -- went to prison during their lifetime			0
that is the reality in the lives of so many of our fellow @entity5 in so many of the communities in which they live			0
" which was fine , at the time -- better late than never			2
mind you , she slipped these comments in at a tech conference where the majority of her comments would focus on other issues			1
@entity44 seemed to have learned her lesson after a @entity114 grand jury did not indict officers in the killing of @entity22			1
she only waited two days to say something about the result : " each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in @entity5 , because despite all the progress we 've made together , african - americans , most particularly @entity12 men , are still more likely to be stopped and searched by police , charged with crimes , and sentenced to long prison terms			1
" but again , these comments were tagged onto a speech she was giving at a women 's conference in @entity135 and hardly echoed beyond the walls of the building where she was speaking			2
while @entity140 2016 contender @entity139 can come right out and say police militarization is a problem and that the officer who killed @entity22 should be fired , @entity43 talks about restoring " balance			1
" while former president @entity145 admits that he found the grand jury decision " hard to understand , " @entity44 is backing limited measures , including police body cameras , contained in @entity1 's executive actions resulting from the @entity72 controversy			1
while @entity1 is sitting down to do a serious interview about race , law and justice on @entity155 , @entity44 is doing events with prince @entity157 and @entity158 in @entity114			1
the point is that while other political leaders who hope to lead this country can take the time out to seriously address the longest - running protests in @entity12 history since the @entity165 , @entity43 sandwiches her comments in at the tail end of paid speaking engagements and keeps it moving			1
that seems a little tone - deaf			0
and this is n't the first time @entity44 has shown this penchant for avoiding thorny cultural and racial issues on the not - quite - yet - campaign trail			1
she assiduously avoided addressing race in a town hall interview earlier this year on @entity0			0
and one has to wonder if she would 've said anything about the @entity184 verdict in the killing of @entity186 if she had n't been giving a speech at the convention of @entity189 ( a black sorority ) the night the verdict came in			0
she certainly has n't said much about it since			0
if @entity44 thinks she 's being smart by avoiding thorny race issues on the campaign trail , she 's making a huge mistake			1
maybe @entity44 thinks that whatever support she may lose in the @entity12 - @entity12 vote will be made up for by high turnout among white women			2
the problem with that logic is that these protests from @entity114 to @entity202 to @entity203 , to @entity204 , to @entity205 , @entity206 and even @entity207 are incredibly diverse			0
take a look at the crowds in @entity210 after the @entity22 verdict and you could see white , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity12 , old , young and other demonstrators all carrying signs that read " @entity217			2
" a new @entity220 / @entity219 poll shows that 47 % of @entity5 believe that the justice system applies different standards to blacks and whites			0
in other words , the people out there marching right now are the @entity64 base , with a few independents and libertarians thrown in there for good measure			0
this is the coalition that @entity44 needs to win the presidency , and on the most important issue in decades she 's not only not ' " ready to lead , " she does n't seem to have much to say , and when she does speak on these issues it 's always as an afterthought to some larger message			1
@entity5 is being wracked by nationwide protests and thousands of @entity5 of all colors are questioning the fundamental fairness of the @entity12 justice system			0
boycotts are happening , malls are being shut down and transportation all across @entity5 is being affected by protests during the biggest shopping season of the year , because many @entity5 are unhappy with our justice system			0
no one expects @entity44 to be out in @entity210 marching with the # icantbreathe hashtag plastered across her cheek			2
but if she decides she wants to be serious about being elected president of the @entity5 , she needs to do more and say more than a few throwaway comments in the midst of her busy speaking and fund - raising schedule			0
the foot soldiers for @entity44 's political future are out marching in the cold , marching toward the change they want to see in @entity5			1
@entity44 might want to catch up to them , because if she does n't , i 'm sure @entity139 , @entity267 or @entity268 would be happy to do so			1
join us on @entity271 / @entity270 .			0

@entity273 : @entity43 's supporters are protesting @entity72 , @entity22 verdicts
he says @entity44 's comments on the issues of police and race have been late , *minimal*
others , including @entity139 and @entity267 , have been more forceful
