-- the @entity1 has barred the import of certain seeds from @entity4 after @entity6 fenugreek seeds were linked to deadly outbreaks of @entity8 in @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity12 officials have also ordered that all seeds imported from one particular @entity6 exporter between 2009 and 2011 be withdrawn from sale , tested and destroyed			1
the move follows a @entity18 ( @entity18 ) report released tuesday that concludes one lot of fenugreek seeds imported from @entity4 and used to produce sprouts is the " mostly likely common link " between the outbreaks of @entity8 in @entity9 and @entity10			1
the import ban , which applies to all @entity1 member states , extends to the end of october			2
the contamination of the fenugreek seeds " probably occurred before the seeds left the importer , " the @entity27 cites the @entity18 report as saying			0
that contamination " reflects a production or distribution process which allowed contamination with fecal material of human and / or animal origin			0
where exactly this took place is still an open question , " the @entity18 report said			0
the @entity18 said it was continuing to investigate where the fenugreek seeds from the @entity6 importer may have gone and concludes that the number of @entity1 states that have received " parts of the suspected lots is much larger than previously known			2
" the @entity18 report does not rule out the possibility that more than one lot of seeds may be implicated in the outbreaks			0
" tracing back the origins of the @entity8 0104 contaminations in @entity10 and @entity9 has been a key priority for the @entity1 from day one of the crisis , " @entity53 and consumer commissioner @entity54 said in a statement			2
the commission would continue to monitor the situation closely and would take additional measures if needed , he said			0
the recent @entity12 outbreaks from a strain of @entity8 have led to 48 deaths in @entity10 and one in @entity67 , the @entity18 said , with 4,178 cases reported in @entity1 states , @entity70 and @entity71			1
the outbreak in @entity10 spread in may , and @entity9 authorities reported an outbreak in the @entity76 region on june 24 , the @entity18 said			0
the agency has offered safety advice for consumers			0
" as seeds sold for sprouting are often sold as seed mixes and cross-contamination can not be excluded , it is important that consumers are advised not to grow sprouts for their own consumption , and also not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been cooked thoroughly , " its statement said			1
in 2010 , the @entity1 imported from @entity4 about 49,000 tons of the types of seeds affected by tuesday 's decision , the @entity27 said , with a total value of more than 56 million euros ( $ 81 million )			1
most seeds for sprouting imported by the @entity1 come from @entity95 and @entity96 , it said .			2

new : the @entity1 is banning the import of seeds and beans for sprouting from @entity4
it has also ordered the withdrawal from the *market* of all seeds from one exporter
a total of 4,178 *e.* coli cases have been reported in @entity12 countries , with nearly 50 deaths
consumers are urged not to eat sprouts or sprouted seeds raw , or to grow their own sprouts
