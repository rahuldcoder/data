@entity0 has just directed one of the first feature films ever to be made in @entity3			1
but she wo n't be able to watch it at her local theater , because cinemas are banned in the kingdom			0
the film , called " @entity9 , " after its protagonist , is billed as the first to be filmed entirely in @entity3 with an all - @entity3 cast			1
it is currently in post-production and being touted for worldwide sales at the @entity15			0
@entity16 , 39 , worked for an oil company until the age of 30 , when she decided to give up her job to pursue her passion			2
" when i turned 30 , i really wanted to have a voice , " said @entity16			0
" people do n't listen to women in @entity3 , they just jump to the next man to speak			1
i loved films and just decided to become a filmmaker			0
" she studied film in @entity31 , @entity32 , and has previously made three short films and a documentary			2
she is @entity3 's first female film director , according to the production company			1
the film , written and directed by @entity16 , tells the story of an 11 - year - old girl growing up in traditional society in the suburbs of @entity41 and desperate for a bicycle , which she 's not allowed			1
" i have a niece , she is very bright and always wanted to do things , but her family is traditional and as she grew older wanted her to stay at home like everyone else , " said @entity16			0
" i based the story around her			0
" outdoor activities like riding a bicycle are not allowed for girls			0
it 's not exactly against the law , but she would get into trouble			2
" @entity16 hopes that @entity9 will help to change attitudes to both women and films in @entity3			1
" i hope it will inspire many girls in @entity3 to become filmmakers , " she said			1
" that makes me very proud			0
" people have contacted me with death threats , but that does n't matter to me			0
everyone in the media business in @entity3 receives death threats			1
" also on inside the @entity70 : @entity3 women : pampered or oppressed ? @entity16 , a mother of two young children , was helped to achieve her dreams by her liberal upbringing			1
she said : " my parents both come from provincial small towns , but they always believed in allowing their daughters to do what they wanted			0
there 's a lot of pressure on fathers to stop their daughters doing things , but my father never listened to it			2
" it took @entity16 three years to get the right backing for her film			2
it is a @entity3 / @entity92 co-production , produced by the @entity94 - based @entity93 with backing and support from @entity97 , launched by the @entity3 prince @entity98			1
@entity16 was keen to work with a @entity100 production company to ensure the film would be seen worldwide			1
ironically , it is unlikely to be seen in @entity3 until its later television release			1
" if people from @entity3 want to see it in a theater , they will have to travel to @entity107 , " said @entity16			1
" it 's sad they will have to travel abroad to watch a film that was shot and produced here			1
" while she is in @entity3 , @entity16 only watches movies rented from a dvd shop			1
she has to send her driver to the shop with a list of the titles she wants , because women are not allowed inside			0
she said : " it never put me off watching films , but it made me want to show they ca n't treat us like that			0
" @entity16 said she faced multiple challenges both casting and shooting in a country with such conservative attitudes			0
" casting a woman in @entity3 is almost impossible			2
it 's difficult to find women who are willing to challenge the norms and appear on camera , " she said			2
also on inside the @entity70 : movie star convicted of ' insulting @entity134 ' eventually one of @entity3 's best known television actresses , @entity137 , was chosen for the adult lead role , and at the last minute a young girl was found to play @entity9			1
" casting the girl took a long time , " said @entity16			0
" we could n't advertise for auditions , so it had to be through word of mouth			0
we looked everywhere around the country and it was n't until one week before filming that we found the right girl			0
" during filming too , the mixed @entity3 and @entity92 crew faced resistance			2
" @entity3 is not the easiest place to work : in a lot of the locations people were hostile because people see the camera as something corrupt , " said @entity16			2
" we filmed in some conservative neighborhoods where people were angry that there was a camera			0
" @entity16 said she is a judge in the @entity163 currently being held by @entity97 , but that the films are being shown on television because they are not allowed in movie theaters			1
two years ago , the planned @entity167 was canceled at the last minute on instructions from the interior ministry , according to @entity170			0
the involvement of prince @entity98 , described by @entity172 as @entity3 's richest capitalist and a nephew of @entity175 , in @entity97 is seen as a sign that cinema will eventually become more widely acceptable in the kingdom			1
in 2006 , @entity97 produced a film called @entity180 , then billed as the first @entity3 feature film			1
however , it was actually filmed in @entity182			0
@entity183 said : " it 's good to have people like @entity186 who are progressive and willing to push for it			2
" she added : " there are a lot of kids who want to make films			0
there 's a whole generation using cameras and mobile phones and they are not cut off from the world around them			2
" once films become a reality , movie theaters will become a reality			1
" follow the @entity204 the @entity70 team on @entity206 : presenter @entity208 , producer @entity209 , producer @entity210 @ @entity211 and writer @entity212 @ catrionadavies			0
