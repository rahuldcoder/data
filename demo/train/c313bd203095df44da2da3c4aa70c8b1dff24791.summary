-- a watchdog group meant to guard @entity3 ' right to privacy against overreach by government cyberintelligence has been around for years			1
if that makes you feel safer , consider this : it had no leader until may , and lawmakers delayed for years to fully staff it			2
president @entity14 met with the group for the first time friday over the phone and e-mail record - gathering scandal involving the @entity20			1
the president wants to enlist the group to " structure a national conversation " on government cyberintelligence and civil rights			1
who are the watchdogs ? the group is called the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , and though it was created in 2004 , it does not appear to have been very active			1
it initially answered directly to then - president @entity29 in an advisory role , but later became an independent agency in 2007 following advice from the @entity33 , according to the @entity34			2
why little will happen to change how we snoop five years later , the @entity27 really only existed on paper , a group of conservative libertarians complained			1
in a may 2012 letter to senators from the group -- led by former @entity43 representative @entity42 of @entity44 -- blasted @entity45 for dallying on staffing the board , while lawmakers were already considering cybersecurity legislation			1
what 's next for @entity50 ? " we are deeply troubled by the fact that it has been almost five years since @entity54 enacted legislation to create an independent @entity27 with meaningful oversight authority , and yet the @entity57 has not yet come into existence , " the letter read			1
@entity45 lawmakers had bounced nominations to the @entity27 that @entity14 made in december 2010 back at him , only to have him nominate them again , according to the @entity62			1
@entity63 : @entity64 was lying their mission ? " minimizing any impact on privacy and civil liberties " while the government expands its fight against cyberthreats , the @entity34 posted on its blog a year after floating the nominees			1
it encouraged their swift confirmation			0
officials cite thwarted plots the conservative advocates adamantly backed the liberal president			0
" we implore you to act without further delay to move these nominations forward , " they wrote to senators			0
last month , @entity14 appointed financial and economic attorney @entity84 to chair the board			1
@entity14 wants to expand its duties to include " big data " -- how private companies like @entity91 or @entity92 treat information they collect from their customers , he said in an interview with journalist @entity96 this week			1
nine years after its inception , @entity27 may begin with its task , now that the @entity20 's intelligence activities have been exposed			1
" we discussed with the president our recommendation that every effort be made to publicly provide the legal rationale for the programs in order to enhance the public discussion and debate about the legality and propriety of the country 's counterterrorism efforts , " the group said in a statement after friday 's meeting , noting it would produce a public review of the recently revealed surveillance programs			2
the @entity20 controversy earlier this month , @entity50 , a former employee of a government contractor , leaked to the media that the @entity20 had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the @entity3			2
it also collected information from @entity3 companies on the internet activity of overseas residents , he said			0
the @entity20 and many @entity45 politicians , including the president , have justified the surveillance program , called @entity130 , as necessary to preventing terrorist threats			0
they emphasize that agents are not randomly listening in on phone conversations and only monitoring the internet activity of " non- @entity3 persons			0
" they mine the data to see who may have contact with known or suspected terrorists , the @entity20 said			0
and their work is subject to scrutiny of a court			0
critics complain that the court operates in secrecy , which prevents it from offering a real check to the @entity20 's activities			1
they say that the exposed top - secret program amounts to a gross encroachment by the government upon citizens ' rights to privacy			2
@entity130 has helped thwart more than 50 terrorist acts worldwide , @entity20 director gen. @entity155 has said			0
but @entity0 terror analyst @entity157 does n't think such broad surveillance has helped foil significant plots on @entity3 soil			0
normal police work has done the job in the overwhelming majority of cases			0
@entity130 's supporters and critics are divided between both parties , creating unlikely alliances between @entity169 and @entity43 to defend or condemn @entity130			2
@entity43 @entity34 majority leader @entity170 promised " serious investigations into potential wrongdoing " over the program , while his party colleague , rep. @entity171 , said journalists involved in reporting stories about the surveillance programs should be investigated for violating national security			0
@entity50 has fled to @entity179			0
lawmakers in @entity45 are building a criminal case against him .			0
