editor 's note : business insider is contributing a series of columns to @entity5 that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world			0
( @entity8 ) -- @entity10 's hit @entity11 game " @entity9 " is arguably the most widely played video game in existence			1
what is especially impressive about that is that " @entity9 " is n't any fun			2
we are n't being snobs , saying people should n't like it because it is n't good			0
we 're saying that people do n't like it , but they play it anyway			0
try explaining " @entity9 " to someone who has never played it , and watch their eyes glaze over			1
ask your friends who fill your @entity11 newsfeed with their " @entity9 " accomplishments , and you 'll find that most of them are embarrassed			1
they think the game is stupid and boring , but they just ca n't stop playing			0
so why do so many people play " @entity9 " if it is n't fun ? there are two main reasons : the simplest reason is advertising			1
" @entity9 " is advertised like crazy all over @entity11 , so it 's always in everyone 's face			1
this advertising is incredibly effective , because it is so immediate : you click on the ad , and you 're playing the game			0
" @entity9 's " parent company , @entity10 , is n't the only one advertising " @entity9 , " though			1
users are constantly advertising the game to their friends , too , through " viral " channels on @entity11			2
as you play , the game periodically prompts you to post about your accomplishments on your @entity11 wall			1
these posts , which are generated with a simple click from within the game , appear in all of your friends ' news feeds			0
this encourages your friends to play			0
so @entity10 gets free advertising			2
and because your name is attached to it , your friends think it 's a word - of - mouth recommendation			0
the less obvious reason that millions of people are addicted to " @entity9 " is that there 's a sense of social obligation to play			1
if you do n't play " @entity9 , " your " @entity9 " friends suffer			2
@entity10 makes it your duty to play			1
getting ahead in the game depends on having plenty of @entity11 friends who are also playing			2
if you know any dedicated " @entity9 " players , chances are you 've seen messages from them about it : their farms need help , and you are just the person ! you are letting your friends down if you do n't play			2
all of this puts " @entity9 " in your face , whether you want it there or not			0
this rubs a lot of people the wrong way , but it 's essential to the game 's success			0
@entity11 recently cut back on game developers ' ability to post updates to users ' walls , because people were angry that their newsfeeds were filling up with " @entity9 " spam			1
facebook games immediately began bleeding users			0
because they are n't fun , they need a constant barrage of ads and viral endorsements to keep people engaged			0
of course , none of these three forces compel the average @entity11 user to play " @entity9			1
" but because the number of @entity11 users is so huge -- over 500 million , at last count -- even a small percentage of @entity11 users can make a game like " @entity9 " very popular			1
this formula does n't lead to good games , but it does lead to consistent success			0
" @entity9 " is in a league of its own in terms of users , but as a game , it is almost identical to every other @entity10 game and every game released by its competitors			1
the same game mechanics are copied and put in different contexts			0
whether you 're running a farm , heading up a mafia family or taking care of your fish , the game remains the same			0
@entity10 does n't even have to think up the contexts : most of its games , including " @entity9 , " are nearly exact replicas of its competitors ' offerings			1
all of this makes facebook an extremely odd platform for games			1
on the one hand , it is incredibly successful , generating hundreds of millions of dollars for @entity10 alone			2
on the other hand , it leads to games that could n't work anywhere else			0
@entity10 has made a lot of noise about establishing its own destination site , but none of these games has ever taken off elsewhere , because people wo n't play them without the ads , the viral reminders and the sense of obligation			1
that should be troubling for @entity10			0
for one thing , its business is at the mercy of @entity11 's whim			2
for another , it raises an important question : what if someone finds a way to make fun games work on @entity11 ? copyright Â© 2011 @entity8 .			2

@entity10 's hit @entity11 game " @entity9 " is arguably the most widely played online game
the company makes it your duty to play " @entity9 , " creating a sense of social obligation
@entity11 is an extremely odd platform for games , but it 's successful
