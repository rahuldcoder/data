-- opening statements are set to begin tuesday in the trial of self - help author and speaker @entity3 , who is charged with three counts of reckless manslaughter in the death of three people at an @entity10 sweat lodge			1
the trial stems from a well - publicized incident that took place during a ceremony at a five - day retreat in @entity16 , @entity10 , on october 8 , 2009			0
two people died during the ceremony at @entity19			0
a third died nine days later , and -- authorities allege -- at least 15 others fell ill. @entity3 could face up to 10 years in prison on each count if convicted			1
his attorney has argued that the author is not to blame for the deaths			1
" we do not seek to minimize the tragedy of the sweat lodge deaths , " said a december 2009 letter to prosecutors from defense attorney @entity29			1
" but these deaths were not the result of criminal conduct			2
mr. @entity3 and his team relied on @entity35 to provide a safe environment , warned people of the risks , did not force people to participate , did not prevent them from leaving , and did everything they could to prepare for any problems and to assist when problems arose			1
" prosecutors claim @entity3 , 53 , was reckless and that the lodge -- made of willow trees and branches , and covered with tarpaulins and blankets -- was heated to a perilously high temperature , causing the participants to suffer dehydration and heat stroke			1
@entity3 also encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot , his attorney has said			1
participants signed a release form saying that the retreat activities could include a sweat lodge with enclosed spaces and high temperatures , @entity29 said			1
@entity63 , 38 , of @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66 , 40 , of @entity67 , died on october 8			0
@entity68 , 49 , of @entity69 , @entity70 , died on october 17			0
the sweat lodge ceremony consisted of eight rounds , with each round lasting 10 to 15 minutes			2
while they were not prevented from leaving , participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds			0
in interviews with authorities , some participants recounted feeling distress in the first few rounds			0
later , they told police , people began to pass out , others began to vomit and still others went into shock			0
some were encouraged to lie down in the dirt to seek relief from the heat			0
" ( @entity3 ) knew that people were in trouble , " @entity91 , @entity63 's cousin , told @entity93 's @entity92 on monday			1
" those calls for help were ignored			0
" @entity3 had conducted the @entity98 for six years at a cost of about $ 10,000 to participants			1
the sweat lodge , 5 feet tall and 23 feet wide , was built to accommodate up to 75 people			2
there was a pit in the center where heated rocks were placed			0
@entity3 poured water over them to create steam			2
prosecutors maintain that @entity3 psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they were n't feeling well , contributing to their deaths			1
@entity29 wrote in the 2009 letter that @entity3 " did not lead or pressure participants into making a choice they otherwise would not have made			2
this was a five - day retreat , not a cult			0
the @entity122 ( @entity123 , @entity3 's company ) philosophy is a practical approach to creating a successful life , not a religious practice			2
