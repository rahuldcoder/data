-- assuming you 've got two ears and a heart , chances are you loved @entity8 's star - studded " @entity14 " dance party video — which @entity9 debuted after explaining that @entity11 's skittish @entity10 had abruptly canceled a scheduled appearance on his show			1
but will you still appreciate the video after learning conclusively that it was n't cobbled together in just two days ? if the answer 's " no , " you might want to close this tab right about now			1
if " yes , " read on			0
almost immediately after @entity9 's exuberant clip premiered aug. 6 , internet naysayers began speculating that @entity11 's " cancellation " was nothing more than an elaborate ruse			1
their evidence : the same episode containing the " @entity14 " montage also featured @entity27 performing his hit " @entity29 , " purportedly in @entity11 's place			0
but according to @entity32 , @entity27 's performance was taped july 31 , days before @entity11 supposedly told @entity9 they were out			1
@entity33 picked up the story , wondering if the whole segment could have been a publicity stunt meant to promote the duo 's upcoming appearance on the @entity39			0
( @entity40 owns both @entity41 and @entity42			0
) @entity0 : @entity43 punks us anyway with a star - studded ' get lucky ' dance party @entity9 addressed the @entity33 post on his show aug. 7 , sarcastically " admitting " that the site was right all along			1
" you got me ! " he said , adding that @entity9 had flown in " the disco @entity51 from @entity53 " just to fool everyone — and " to help someone else 's show on another network a month from now			1
" but that was n't his last word on the subject			0
during a recent out - of - character guest spot on comedian @entity64 's podcast , the @entity42 host admitted that many of the @entity11 show 's cameos and @entity27 's performance were filmed in advance			2
he also explained that they had to be — because while @entity11 had agreed to an appearance , they were refusing to perform or be interviewed on the show			0
@entity9 offered to accommodate the taciturn musicians by performing a six - minute monologue framed as interview questions			2
his team also put together a bit in which @entity11 's manager would act as interlocutor : " we had one joke , and i wish we could 've done this joke ... ' @entity64 , can i ask you — how do i even know it 's them in the robot outfits ? how do i even know it 's them ? ' and he goes , ' @entity9 , if it was n't really them , they 'd be doing the song			1
' " @entity0 : music review - ' @entity29 ' alas , nothing seemed to take ; the " robots " were n't happy with a script that focused so much on their lack of performance			0
and as @entity9 continued trying to convince @entity11 to give him something — anything — to work with , he also began filming celebrities dancing to " @entity14 " as a fallback			2
( hearing this should n't be a surprise ; @entity0 noted on aug. 2 that @entity9 had been filming his guests grooving to the song			1
) in the meantime , the show also shot @entity27 doing " @entity29 ; " the plan was always to have @entity27 " save the day " after @entity11 's silent appearance			2
and eventually , @entity11 canceled altogether — leading to the show that ended up airing			0
( @entity118 fact : the dance party footage may have never seen the light of day if @entity122 had n't said " yes " to @entity9			1
