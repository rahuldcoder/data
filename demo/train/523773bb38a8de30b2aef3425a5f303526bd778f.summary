-- the entire first floor had a rust - colored ring 3 feet high where @entity3 had left its mark			1
the damaged furniture had already been tossed , and all that was left was a concrete floor and bare walls			1
our @entity11 " @entity10 " team immediately got to work , ripping out the interior walls and removing the insulation until only wooden beams were standing			1
as the drywall crumbled in our hands , we shoveled it into trash bags in a cloud of white dust , and hauled it off to the curb			0
i spent most of the day dismantling the kitchen , ripping out cabinets and countertops with a crowbar			1
everything was almost new -- installed only six years ago -- but had to go , because it had been soaked by @entity3			1
the homeowner 's 84 - year - old father helped me carry out the heavier appliances			2
nearly two weeks after the storm , the gas stove was still dripping wet as we lugged it to the curb			0
by the time we finished , the entire contents of the first floor were sitting in the street waiting to be hauled away by the heavy equipment making its way through the @entity43 section of @entity44 , @entity45			2
through it all , the owner , @entity46 , stayed remarkably composed as complete strangers took apart his home			2
when we asked how he was able to able to hold it together under such trying circumstances , he shrugged off the question			0
the worst was over , he said ; everything he owned had already been discarded			0
he was channeling all of the energy he had left into the cleanup and rebuilding			1
@entity58 community gives thanks even after @entity3 just a few blocks away , @entity59 -- who had never had so much as a drop of water in his basement in 40 years , until @entity3 -- had just finished cleaning up flood damage with the help of another team of volunteers			1
he showed us how the water had risen almost to the top of the basement stairs , about 9 feet high			0
this @entity74 , my thoughts turn to @entity46 , @entity59 and the thousands of other storm victims in @entity45 and @entity76 who are homeless this holiday season			2
many are living with family members or in shelters and , if they are lucky , will be able to move back after @entity81 's			0
they remind me how thankful i am to be part of an organization that 's making a difference for @entity86 residents still dealing with power outages and putting their homes back together			2
the cleanup we joined in the @entity43 is just one of dozens of @entity93 relief projects			2
every day since the storm , our relief workers have been out in the field offering help to first responders , health care providers and shelter officials			0
@entity11 also has a mobile clinic traveling the streets of @entity45 , providing portable exam rooms for health clinics unable to treat patients due to damaged facilities			1
staying afloat after @entity3 in @entity106 , where some residents have been without power for weeks , our relief workers are going door to door delivering sleeping bags to families without heat			1
and in @entity113 , where thousands of people have been temporarily displaced , we delivered medical aid to a shelter housing hundreds of families			0
when our relief workers arrived , shelter officials were grappling with how to care for a large population with chronic illness			0
about one - third of the shelter dwellers are diabetics and the shelter had no way to safely store insulin , so we bought them a refrigerator			0
we also delivered wheelchairs , medical cots and 1,400 pounds of medical aid -- everything from cough and cold medicines to first aid supplies			0
@entity11 has been responding to disasters all over the world for 30 years , and helping people in crisis is what we do best			1
but this disaster is personal for many of us because it happened in our own backyard			0
we are committed to see the storm victims through the recovery , just as we did in @entity144 and @entity145 after @entity146			0
not everyone can be a relief worker on the front lines of an emergency , but we can all make a difference by supporting organizations like @entity11 that assist the survivors			1
for more on how you can help the victims of @entity3 go to @entity0 / impact .			1
