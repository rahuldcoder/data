@entity0 spoke to @entity1 about the impact of @entity4 ' march through northern @entity5 , and the militant group 's control of some oil fields			1
he explained how they used the oil fields to raise funds , and how it could impact global prices			1
this is an edited version of the conversation			0
how much of @entity5 's oil market do @entity4 control ? @entity4 control just a few marginal fields in @entity5 's north , but they are enough to fund the terrorist group 's self - sufficiency			1
a month ago , the @entity4 -- controlled oil market in @entity5 was reported to be worth $ 1 million a day			1
now , with expansion , further control of oil fields and smuggling routes , the market is believed to be raising at least $ 2 million a day			1
this could fetch them more than $ 730 million a year , enough to sustain the operation beyond @entity5			2
isis have been battling over @entity33 and the refinery is still under siege			0
however , if @entity4 succeed in capturing it , the refinery would be very difficult to operate without capable and technical staff			0
one important factor for the stability of global markets : @entity4 is not yet in the south of @entity5 , where the country 's true oil bounty lies			1
capturing the southern assets of the country would be mission impossible for the group			0
the territory is far from fault lines , and is dominated by @entity50 , which makes dominating the region difficult for the @entity53 militant group			0
what do @entity4 do with the oil they get ? isis smuggle the crude oil and trade it for cash and refined products , at a reduced price			1
they also have their own small and rudimentary refineries in @entity63			0
refined oil is returned to @entity4 for selling locally , in @entity5 and @entity63			1
@entity4 also use the oil in their own warfare			2
@entity4 controls smuggling routes and the crude transported by tankers to @entity71 via @entity73 province , to @entity74 via @entity75 , to @entity76 via @entity77 , to @entity63 's local market and to the @entity5 of @entity5 , where most of it gets refined locally			1
@entity76 has turned a blind eye to this and may continue to do so until they come under pressure from the @entity84 to close down oil black markets in the country 's south			0
@entity4 ' oil will remain limited to these black markets , and the group will have no chance to establish a sophisticated pipeline network			1
fixed distribution networks are complex , require investment and can become targets by the @entity96 and @entity97			0
what is @entity4 ' ultimate aim and how does oil wealth play into it ? at present , @entity4 are trying to establish a self - sufficient state and a capital in what is known as the " sunni triangle " ( west and north @entity5 ) , and oil production will be part of this			1
they want to be self - sufficient , expand their territorial control , recruit more jihadists -- with focus on extremists with foreign passports -- and extend their operations , to eventually launch attacks on @entity118 countries			0
@entity4 declared its caliphate by turning @entity5 and @entity63 into a hub to attract extremists			2
they are aiming to take over the @entity122 as their epicenter to launch attacks globally			0
if this happens , they will be in control of a region that holds 60 % of world 's conventional energy reserves and produces 40 % of global oil and gas production			0
and the only way to do it is by attracting the masses of jihadists and extremists from all over the world to eventually outnumber the locals , which will endanger global security and economies			0
how is @entity4 ' control of some of @entity5 's oil fields impacting the global economy ? in the short to mid-term , the impact will be minimal as @entity5 's south is its dominant producer			1
however , there are enough rich assets in the midlands and the north part of @entity5 that @entity4 could reach out to , a potential capacity that could ramp up to a million barrels a day -- from its current 30,000 barrels a day -- should they seize control the oil - rich city of @entity158 and its surrounding districts			2
if they succeed in controlling those assets , cash inflow could stretch their empire of terrorism beyond imagination			0
but so far , @entity4 oil trading has remained local with buyers in @entity71 , @entity76 , @entity63 and @entity74 via middlemen network and truck owners			2
however , the instability created by @entity5 effectively being broken up would have a ripple impact , in terms of hindering investment prospect in the country			2
in turn , that could prevent @entity5 from reaching its 2020 target of 9 million barrels of oil production per day , which is three times @entity5 's current oil supply and 10 % of global demand .			2

terrorist group @entity4 controls some oil fields in @entity5 , which helps fund its activities
the group is using smuggling routes to get crude into *nearby* countries , and refine it
the refined oil is then sold locally and used to fund @entity4 ' warfare and raise money
the impact on global markets has so far been limited as @entity4 is not in southern @entity5
