-- the president of @entity2 has invited the internationally recognized president of @entity4 , @entity3 , for an official state visit , the @entity6 of @entity2 announced wednesday			1
president @entity8 has discussed the visit with @entity3 , the ministry said in a statement , and the two leaders " agreed that the visit should take place at a mutually convenient time			0
" but it 's not clear when that time may come , since @entity3 is virtually blocked inside the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity4 , by troops sent by @entity19 , who claimed the presidency after the november 28 runoff			2
while an independent electoral commission declared @entity3 the winner , the country 's @entity22 invalidated the results in some provinces and proclaimed that @entity19 , the incumbent president , had won			0

at the time , @entity8 's government called upon all political entities , including the @entity22 of @entity4 , to respect the decision of the @entity44 in declaring @entity3 the rightful winner of the elections			1
" the government of @entity2 is deeply concerned about @entity49 leaders who reject elections results that are not in their favour			1
" such actions not only deny people the right to have leaders of their choice , but also thwart efforts to maintain peace and security on the @entity49 continent , " the statement from the @entity53 says			2

@entity2 officials also vowed not to attend any @entity35 or @entity71 ( @entity71 ) meetings if @entity67 was invited			0
however , the government of @entity2 softened its stance after @entity67 and his rival , @entity74 , formed a national unity government to ease @entity66 's economic and political predicament			1
@entity2 also did not recognise the leadership of @entity78 , after he was sworn in early last year as the transitional president of @entity80			0
