-- lawyer and human rights activist @entity1 has long been an outspoken campaigner for gender justice in @entity4 , a country where half its women are married before the age of 18			1
as the head of the @entity4 chapter of @entity9 in @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , @entity1 is at the forefront of the battle against inequality , traveling around the country to promote education and to stop young girls from giving up on school and marrying in their early teens			1
but the prominent activist , who is herself the mother of a young daughter , is not only concerned with the rights of teenage girls			1
she is also targeting cultural practices that harm older , vulnerable women in @entity4			1
' @entity25 ' one such custom , prevalent in the southern tip of the landlocked country , is " widow cleansing , " a traditional practice in which a widow is expected to have sexual relations , " in order to cleanse her , " explains @entity1			2
" there is a belief that if she does not sleep with someone , the spirit of her dead husband will come and visit upon her and her family will be cursed , " she adds			0
@entity1 says that the practice is not forced upon widows			2
instead , she says , the tradition has become so much part of the culture that widows themselves call for it			2
" it 's a mindset issue , " says @entity1			2
" even the widows , they 've told me , ' i do n't want to die , i do n't want a curse to come to my husband			0
' they cry to be cleansed			0
" read this : married at 13 to man in his 70s @entity1 says the tradition , which involves unprotected sex , thus increasing the chances of hiv infection , has been turned into a business			1
" there are professional cleansers in villages , " says @entity1			2
she says these men charge widows up to $ 50 for their services , in a country where the minimum wage is less than $ 1 per day			0
in recent times , there have been several initiatives by @entity74 , as well as other groups , to try and change the situation			0
one effort is to target the " professional cleansers " in attempt to get them to change their ways			0
" some have actually come out in the open and said : ' i used to be a commercial cleanser , i 'm @entity61 positive , i 've stopped , it 's not fine and i go village by village telling other commercial cleansers to stop this , it 's a risky taboo behavior			2
' " the power of education a daughter of a professor of @entity94 , @entity1 grew up in @entity4 in a relatively privileged family			1
she received her law degree in @entity97 before moving to the @entity98 to focus on gender and development studies			0
@entity1 saw first - hand the difference that education can make to a woman 's life , and that 's why all her efforts to promote gender equality -- from campaigning against child marriage and domestic abuse to protecting widows ' rights through her work as a lawyer -- have been shaped by the transformative power of education			1
" in this country , to get ahead in life , to beat poverty , you need education , " she says			0
read this : ' why women will change world ' " i know the difference between an uneducated woman in @entity4 and a person of education , as i am , and i decided to use my position to uplift others , " adds @entity1			1
" i decided i 'm going to dedicate my life to dealing with injustice , just because i do n't like it when a structure or system puts others in poverty , puts others in a position of inequality , " adds @entity1			2
' the dispossession of widows ' another campaign spearheaded by @entity1 is the fight against the prevalent culture of property grabbing , one of the most deep - rooted forms of discrimination suffered by widows in @entity4			1
@entity1 says that all across the country widows are at risk of having their matrimonial property taken by their late husband 's relatives , often leaving them and their children homeless			1
" the way our family structures are done is that when a man and a woman get married they are not considered related , " says @entity1			0
" a man is still looked at by his family as he is theirs and the woman is looked at by her family as she is theirs			0
" read this : ' @entity171 women a voice , ' say activists @entity1 says this entrenched culture , coupled with a prevalent assumption that women do not have an earning capacity , has condemned many widows to acute poverty			1
" when the husband dies , " says @entity1 , " his people , they come in and say , ' what did our son buy in this house ? where is the stuff ? ' they do n't look at the stuff as belonging to the family			0
" @entity192 fought hard for more than 10 years to advance women 's rights to keep their marital estate , calling for reform in @entity4 's inheritance laws			1
its campaign , which met strong resistance , finally succeeded in 2011 when the country 's parliament voted to make property grabbing an offense and protect the spouse 's and children 's share in the deceased 's assets			0
" a law is a law -- it might not be like it 's working immediately , but it 's got staying power , " says @entity1 , adding that more needs to be done to raise awareness about the reforms and to inform widows of their rights			1
@entity1 says that despite all the difficulties , it is victories like this that make her decision to commit her life in the fight against gender injustice worthwhile			0
" i 've been working on this business for 15 years ; they 've been moments of hope , " she says .			0
