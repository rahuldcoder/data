-- formula one world champion @entity1 looks set to join @entity3 after announcing his shock exit from @entity5 on saturday			1
the @entity6 , who has spent the past six seasons with @entity5 , is being hotly tipped to join the @entity10 racing marque from the start of 2015			2
@entity1 broke the news of his departure in @entity14 ahead of sunday 's @entity16 @entity15 , but has so far remained tight - lipped on his plans			1
but @entity19 racing legend @entity18 believes all roads now point to @entity21 for the @entity6			1
" my logic tells me that @entity1 will now go to @entity3 , " @entity18 said , @entity22 reported			1
" why ? because @entity24 has fallen out of favor there			2
there is new management ( at @entity3 ) , they need some new motivation in the team and , of course , @entity1 is the world champion , @entity6 and in the same style as ( @entity37 ) @entity36 , " added @entity18 , who won two of his three @entity19 world titles with @entity3			1
@entity24 would n't be drawn on the issue when interviewed by journalists following saturday 's qualifying session saying his priority was to help @entity3			1
last month , he said there was " no problem " with him seeing out the remaining two years of his contract with the @entity10 team			0
but @entity18 thinks otherwise and says that the @entity46 would be well served by " some @entity6 thoroughness " that @entity1 could bring			1
@entity3 has yet to comment on the status of either driver while @entity1 himself says an announcement on his future can be expected " very soon			1
" @entity1 's news shocked the @entity19 paddock and will bring to an end a long relationship with the @entity58 - based team , first as a junior racer then @entity60 before moving to @entity5 in 2009			1
in his second season @entity1 clinched the first of his four world titles but the 27 - year - old has struggled this year and currently lies fifth in the standings and trailing his new teammate @entity66			2
the @entity67 is third in the drivers championship , taking the fight to the @entity71 duo of @entity72 and @entity73 who have dominated this year			0
it was with this backdrop that @entity1 made his move			0
" after 15 very enjoyable and successful years with @entity5 , i have decided to leave @entity5 at the end of this year , " @entity1 said in a statement			2
" of course it is a big step and hard to make such a decision			0
the chance to drive in @entity19 , the first win with @entity60 , the four @entity82 wins with @entity5 and many other great memories have bound @entity5 and myself together into a kind of family			2
no one can take these times away from us			0
" musical chairs no sooner had @entity1 announced his impending departure was @entity5 filling the empty cockpit with @entity92 graduating from the @entity60 team after just a single season in @entity19			1
" it 's been our philosophy for several years now to back youth and grow our own talent and that 's what we did with @entity1 , " said @entity5 team principal @entity95			2
" @entity92 's an exciting talent and prospect and it 's an exciting new dawn for @entity5			0
" @entity95 noted that it had been " one hell of a journey " with @entity1 referencing both his and the team 's achievements which amount to four constructors ' titles and 38 grand prix victories			0
" he joined us as a young man and now he 's matured and he 's decided it 's time to move on , it 's his decision , we 're not going to hold him back and it 's an exciting time for us , " @entity95 added			0
" i think he reached a stage in his career where he fancied a new challenge , so that 's his prerogative and like in any relationship , if someone 's heart is not in it , then it 's time to move on			0
" if @entity1 does replace @entity24 at @entity3 then the @entity127 could be on his way back to @entity129			1
@entity24 spent one season with the @entity58 - based team in 2007 before moving on @entity132 then to @entity3 in 2010			1
should he return then either @entity133 or @entity135 rookie @entity134 would have to make way with the smart money on the 34 - year - old @entity138 who is out of contract come the end of the season			0
@entity142 front row meanwhile out on the track , @entity73 pipped teammate @entity72 to pole in qualifying for sunday 's race at @entity14			0
@entity148 driver @entity147 was third quickest with his teammate @entity149 directly behind him in fourth			0
@entity1 scraped into the top ten and will start in ninth place while teammate @entity66 is three places ahead in sixth with @entity24 steering his @entity3 to fifth			1
@entity72 currently leads @entity73 by three points in the drivers ' championship with five races remaining			0
