-- it was a game that featured one of the most expensively assembled casts a @entity5 derby has ever seen			0
quite rightly , it was settled by one of the most valuable forwards in world football			0
@entity11 's second half strike was enough to give @entity12 a closely fought 1 - 0 victory over a @entity15 side that played the majority of this tense match with ten men after @entity19 was sent off late in the first period			1
the result marks a fourth consecutive derby victory for @entity12 and keeps them on the tails of second placed @entity25 in the @entity27 standings			1
" all the games are ( worth ) three points but it 's important to win the derby , " city manager @entity28 told @entity30 after the match			0
" it 's a special moment to win against @entity15			1
" @entity37 's men have struggled in recent weeks , losing to @entity38 and @entity39 in domestic competitions whilst drawing with @entity41 in the @entity42			1
but @entity12 showed admirable grit to shut out their cross-town opponents sunday after coming under real pressure in the closing stages			1
" they ( @entity15 ) played well towards the end , " @entity12 captain @entity47 said			1
" we had most of the chances but you miss a couple and you can seem to lose control of the game			0
" the derby win is massive			0
for a minute , the league does n't matter			0
it is a boost for us and we will do our job again in the @entity42 on wednesday			0
" @entity12 's recent dominance in this fixture now makes the big spending " noisy neighbors " accusation once leveled by former @entity15 manager @entity65 seem a long time ago			1
if anything , the big spending tag is now more apt for @entity15			2
the @entity68 trumped @entity12 and all others in the @entity27 this close season by splashing out over $ 239 million on new talent like @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 to aid new manager @entity79 's assault on the title			1
@entity12 were hardly penny pinchers themselves , however , bringing in the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 at a combined cost of $ 78 million , but were more restrained in the market than in years gone by			2
it was one of the mainstays of the light blues recent triumphs , himself a $ 60 million signing from @entity94 back in 2011 , who would settle this affair			0
@entity11 looked lively all afternoon , testing @entity97 early on with a rasping strike from a tight angle and then forcing the @entity15 keeper into a brave block later in the half			1
when @entity19 was sent off , after picking up a second booking for a lunging tackle on @entity106 that @entity79 later described as " not very smart , " it looked like the lively @entity107 would find more space against @entity15 's depleted back line			1
while that did n't exactly turn out to be the case , as @entity15 still created more than their fair share of chances , he was to prove the difference just after the hour mark			2
@entity116 was expertly played through by @entity117 before cutting the ball back for @entity11 to sweep the ball high beyond @entity97			2
it was a typically smart @entity11 goal , displaying nifty movement to step away from his marker to create the space for the pull back			1
@entity15 reacted by pushing forward despite their numerical disadvantage and came close through efforts from @entity128 and @entity129			2
@entity12 still created chances of their own , however			2
@entity131 cracked the upright after a clever through ball from @entity117 while @entity135 made @entity97 work after shooting from the edge of the box			0
with time running out @entity139 burst through the @entity12 defense and claimed to have been brought down by the covering @entity142			0
referee @entity143 remained unmoved and when the ball broke to @entity72 , the @entity107 's shot was brilliantly saved low down to his right by @entity146			0
it was to be the last clear cut chance of the match as @entity12 closed out to maintain their local dominance .			0

@entity12 defeat @entity15 1 - 0
@entity11 scores only goal of game
@entity15 reduced to ten men in first half as @entity19 sent off
result marks @entity12 's first victory in three matches
