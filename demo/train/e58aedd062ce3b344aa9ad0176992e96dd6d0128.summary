@entity0 , @entity1 -- criminal defendants are expected to make initial appearances in federal courts in @entity6 and @entity0 on friday in connection with what one federal agency calls the largest human smuggling investigation in its history			1
@entity13 and @entity14 authorities arrested dozens of people thursday in what @entity13 officials say is " the culmination of a comprehensive year - long " investigation focusing on shuttle buses operating along the border between @entity1 and @entity14			1
" this operation has dealt a serious blow to the infrastructure of some of @entity1 's most prolific and profitable human smuggling organizations -- organizations that made their money by moving people , " @entity22 , homeland security assistant secretary for @entity23 , said at a news conference thursday afternoon			1
the investigation is called @entity33 because of what officials call the " brazen nature " of the shuttle services , allegedly part of a confederation of illegal immigrant smuggling rings			1
the investigation " included unprecedented cooperation with @entity14 's @entity42 , " and it " ultimately implicated high - level members of human smuggling organizations " in northern @entity14 and the @entity1 cities of @entity6 , @entity0 and @entity47 , @entity23 said			2
eight hundred agents and officers from nine federal and local law enforcement agencies fanned out across @entity1 on thursday , making arrests in the three above cities , plus @entity53 , and shutting down businesses			1
authorities in @entity14 and @entity56 also made arrests			0
@entity23 , which is part of the @entity58 , said owners and employees of five @entity1 commercial shuttle services are among the 47 criminal suspects taken into custody after search and arrest warrants were executed in @entity1			1
@entity14 agents made four criminal arrests , according to @entity68 , @entity23 's @entity70 regional communications director			2
authorities announced two arrests in @entity56 , a location underscoring the national reach of the smuggling operation			2
here 's how the rings operated , federal authorities said : smugglers would help illegal immigrants enter the @entity13 near a border city such as @entity47			1
they would then be transported to @entity0 , where one of the shuttle vans would take them to @entity6			2
once there , they would rendezvous with another vehicle and be taken to a drop house , and they would then be moved to cities all over the @entity13 , authorities said			2
illegal immigrants were allegedly issued phony tickets for shuttle trips , which enabled drivers to claim they were operating legitimate businesses if they were stopped by law enforcement			0
while most of the smuggled people identified in the investigation came from @entity14 and @entity98 , others came from far - flung locations , such as @entity100			0
" the defendants wrongly believed they could operate with impunity by hiding behind the veil of legitimacy these businesses provided			0
using our investigative expertise , we 've dismantled these transnational organizations and literally seized the engines that were driving the criminal enterprise , " @entity22 said			0
the timing of the raids has drawn criticism from immigration rights groups			1
" i think we 're getting absolutely mixed messages , " @entity114 , director of @entity115 , said thursday			1
" i saw that just yesterday , first lady @entity117 said she wants to see immigration reform happen , and then we wake up this morning and we have @entity23 raids intensively throughout the state of @entity1			1
" the first lady visited @entity14 this week , where she met with her counterpart , @entity121			0
@entity23 officials say politics played no role in the operation			0
they say the massive investigation and resulting sweep represent a shift in enforcement strategy			0
for years , law enforcement officials concentrated on busting illegal immigrant drop houses			0
now , federal officials say , they are after the transportation networks that supply the smugglers ' human cargo			0
@entity2 's @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0

operation in @entity33 deals " serious blow " to smugglers , @entity58 official says
eight hundred agents and officers from nine agencies mobilized in @entity1
owners , employees of 5 @entity1 shuttle services are among those taken into custody
saying @entity13 sends " mixed messages , " raids ' timing draws ire of immigration group official
