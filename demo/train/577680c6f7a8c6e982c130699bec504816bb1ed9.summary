@entity0 -- among the political threats wielded by @entity3 in his carnival barker quest for the presidency is that if denied the @entity7 nomination , he would run as an independent			1
as an independent myself , i usually cheer the prospect of any independent campaign			2
it shakes up the arrogant assumption that our elections are wholly owned subsidiaries of the two major parties and their respective special interests			0
but @entity3 has already burned his bridges with most independent voters by choosing to go full birther and pander to the far right wing of the @entity7			1
it 's a shame because in his purely ceo persona , @entity3 could have mounted a semi-credible independent campaign			1
look at what @entity27 was able to accomplish with such an appeal nearly 20 years ago or what mayor @entity30 has done in @entity0 to date			2
an independent candidate running on a proven record of executive leadership , job creation and improving @entity37 competitiveness could be a serious presidential candidate this time around			1
especially because a new @entity41 / @entity40 poll shows that 41 % of @entity37 voters now identify as independents			2
we are the plurality and provide the balance of power in any election			0
independent voters tend to be closer to @entity7 on economic issues and closer to @entity50 on social issues			1
in other words , they are fiscally conservative but socially liberal			0
they hate hyper - partisanship and special - interest gridlock in @entity56 , and they have been deficit hawks since at least the days of @entity27			0
it 's perhaps useful to remember that @entity27 campaigned primarily on reducing the deficit and the debt at a time when @entity37 was struggling to get out of a recession and many people thought that @entity64 was a rising power that would eclipse the @entity37			0
now , many of those same conditions exist , with @entity68 taking the place of @entity64 in the " @entity71 " narrative			0
but crucially , @entity27 was decidedly liberal - to - libertarian in his social beliefs			0
he was avowedly abortion rights and even back then supported gays in the military			0
the ceo candidate is usually liberated from social issue litmus tests by saying that what people do in their private lives does n't affect on - the - job performance			0
a guy such as @entity3 could embody the old libertarian line , " i want the government out of the boardroom and the bedroom			2
but instead , @entity3 has done a 180 - degree reversal on abortion ( like @entity91 before him ) in the hopes of winning the @entity7 nomination , because abortion - rights @entity7 have become an endangered species despite the endurance of " individual freedom " rhetoric			1
( we can get into how @entity101 's wife co-founded @entity102 in the 1930s another time			0
) even worse , he made a strategic decision to pander to the outer reaches of @entity37 politics by embracing thoroughly discredited conspiracy theories to drum up support from the fringe			0
this has succeeded in the short run , compounded by his already high name recognition			0
but it will hurt both @entity3 and the @entity7 in the long run , while nuking any hope he had of appealing to independent voters			1
if @entity3 were to try and run as an independent , he could still win enough votes to poll in the low single digits of the popular vote , as @entity119 did before him			1
but given his super-rich persona -- now added to his opportunistic endorsement of @entity123 -- his votes would come entirely out of the @entity7 nominee 's hide , opening the door for president @entity128 's re-election			1
in contrast , @entity27 's independent campaign won 19 % of the popular vote in 1992 -- coming in second in terms of all - time independent presidential candidacies to @entity137 's @entity136 presidential campaign in 1912			2
they won votes from the vast vital center of the @entity37 electorate			0
@entity3 has debased himself and any ideas he had of a political career with the serial idiocies he 's articulated in this flirtation with a presidential campaign			1
of course , there will be a cadre of political consultants who encourage him to run because they see dollar signs in their eyes , not because they are thinking of the good of the republic			0
this is predictable but pathetic			0
independent voters are now the largest and fastest - growing segment of the electorate			1
at the end of the day , we decide which party will win control of @entity162 or which candidate will win the presidency			2
but a candidate who panders to the extremes and parades his own irresponsibility can not assume that he 'll win independent votes just because he slaps the independent label on a self - funded candidacy			2
a credible independent candidate needs to be a consistent advocate for the principled positions independent voters care about -- reducing the deficit and debt while combating hyper - partisanship			1
@entity3 made a decision to inflame polarization in the pursuit of self - promotion			2
as a result , he sacrificed his right to be taken seriously as well as any claims he had to represent independent voters credibly in the 2012 election			1
