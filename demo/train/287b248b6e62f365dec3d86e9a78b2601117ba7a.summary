@entity0 is taking back statements he made about child pornography and sex offenders			1
in a recent interview with the @entity6 's @entity5 , the lawyer and prolific author of books and @entity11 adaptations such as " @entity12 , " " @entity13 " and " @entity14 " sparked outrage when he expressed his belief that some people who view child pornography online are receiving punishments that do n't match the scale of the crime			1
" we have prisons now filled with guys my age , 60 - year - old white men , in prison , who 've never harmed anybody ( and ) would never touch a child , " @entity0 said during a conversation about high @entity23 prison rates			1
" but they got online one night and started surfing around , probably had too much to drink or whatever , and pushed the wrong buttons and went too far and got into child porn			1
... they deserve some type of punishment , but 10 years in prison ? " there 's so many of them now , sex offenders ... that they put them in the same prison , like they 're a bunch of perverts or something			1
" he then used an old law school friend as an example : " i have no sympathy for a real pedophile			2
but so many of these guys do n't deserve harsh prison sentences			2
a friend of mine , this was 10 years ago , was drinking , and his drinking was out of control			2
and he went to a website , and it was labeled , 16 - year - old wannabe hookers or something , some stupid website			0
and it said 16 - year - old girls			0
so he went there and downloaded some stuff			0
" it was 16 - year - old girls that look 30			0
... he should n't have done it			0
but it was n't 10 - year - old boys , and he did n't touch anything			0
" to @entity0 's recollection , the website his friend visited was actually a sting operation to capture sex offenders			1
he said his friend was then sent to prison for three years			0
those comments and the nature in which @entity0 discussed the very serious issue of child pornography incited a flood of hurt , disappointed and angry reactions from fans			1
" the day that you came out in an interview and said that watchers of child porn get too stiff of a penalty for it ( you said 10 years was too much ) makes you someone that i can not support nor no longer want to read , " a reader named @entity92 shared on @entity0 's facebook page ; another posted that she 's taken her entire @entity0 library to her " burn barrel " with the intent to set the books on fire			1
" how do you think child porn is made ? " a poster named @entity109 asked on @entity0 's page			1
" someone is still getting hurt you imbecile			0
i 'm sad to say that i will never purchase , nor consume , one of your books ever again			0
" after the uproar began , @entity0 issued an apology			2
" anyone who harms a child for profit or pleasure , or who in any way participates in child pornography -- online or otherwise -- should be punished to the fullest extent of the law , " the author said in a statement			2
" my comments made two days ago during an interview with the @entity6 newspaper @entity5 were in no way intended to show sympathy for those convicted of sex crimes , especially the sexual molestation of children			1
i can think of nothing more despicable			0
i regret having made these comments , and apologize to all			2
" that may not be enough for some of his former followers			0
" you clearly said in the interview that people ( like your drunk friend ) who look at child porn do n't deserve severe punishment , " @entity147 user @entity145 posted in response to @entity0			1
" not sure how you can backtrack that statement			0
