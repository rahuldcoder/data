-- in the face of injustice , the @entity1 tells us to " cry aloud , spare not , lift up your voice like a trumpet			0
" @entity9 's @entity8 says the people have a right to assemble and petition their lawmakers for the redress of grievances			1
it is in this spirit that a growing coalition of @entity18 is exercising its moral calling and constitutional right by challenging the shameful leadership of our state government -- even if it means going to jail			1
we do n't take civil disobedience lightly			0
but the avalanche of extreme policies from gov. @entity28 and the @entity29 -- attacking the poor and unemployed , cutting crucial funding from public education and dismantling voting rights -- left us no choice			1
from teenage college students to elderly grandmothers , we are assembling in the @entity37 , week after week , to sing , pray and force politicians to hear our voices			0
after our first nonviolent protest , 17 of us were arrested and jailed			2
the next monday , 30 moral witnesses were carted off in handcuffs , and the next week the number was 49			0
last week , 57 protesters were arrested and jailed			0
still more of us are prepared to put our bodies on the line to oppose the backward , far - right ideological vision taking hold in our state			1
in the first 50 days of this session alone , the @entity29 and @entity28 cut the earned income tax credit for more than 900,000 poor and working people			1
they rejected federal funding to expand @entity54 to cover 500,000 @entity55 without health insurance			2
they slashed state unemployment benefits and rejected federally funded @entity59 to 170,000 laid - off workers			1
this vicious war on the poor will devastate hundreds of thousands of @entity18 who are already suffering			1
and with no checks on the @entity67 hold on the legislature and governorship , these laws are only the beginning			0
piling further indignities on the poor , they also want to require people applying for temporary assistance or benefits to submit to criminal background checks , and force applicants to a job training program for low - income workers to take a drug test , for which they have to pay			1
now the legislature wants to increase and expand taxes on groceries , haircuts and prescription drugs			0
they 're even taking aim at poor children with a bill to lower the income requirement for @entity9 's prekindergarten program , making it off limits to nearly 30,000 children who would have previously qualified			1
perhaps most terrifying is that the politicians who have seized control are trying to rig the state 's election rules , seeking to remain in power far after this legislative session			2
in their kitchen sink approach to voter suppression , they have pushed bills to require strict forms of photo id for voting , repeal same - day registration , cut early voting from 17 days to six and ban early voting on sundays			1
they even want to impose a tax penalty on the parents of students who register to vote at their @entity9 college addresses , and pass the most restrictive felony disenfranchisement law in the country			2
these measures have been carefully crafted to make voting harder for people of color , students , seniors and the working poor			1
@entity28 , house speaker @entity121 and @entity124 president @entity123 @entity122 apparently intend to be the new @entity125 , adopting the same @entity126 of blocking the vote and dividing our state further into haves and have - nots			1
we will not sit idly by as this governor and legislature trample on the most vulnerable in our state without the world knowing about it			2
we will keep going to the @entity37 where their bills are being passed , bearing witness to their ugly , immoral and unconstitutional agenda			0
we will not allow this to happen in the dark			0
this battle is so urgent that dr. @entity143 , a pioneering @entity144 researcher at the @entity145 at @entity146 , was arrested at the @entity29 , despite having completed a 199 - mile ultra-marathon the previous day			2
though physically drained , he still took a stand			0
when @entity152 , an 18 - year - old freshman at @entity153 , decided to participate , her friends and family expressed concerns about her future			0
her courageous response to them : " i 'm doing this so i can have a future			0
" we call on all @entity18 of conscience to join us in using the tools of protest to show the nation the shameful acts taking place here			1
our arrests will not stop us			0
and we will be heard			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the @entity172			2

@entity174 : a coalition of @entity18 challenges shameful state leadership
he says *series* of policies cut funds to education , unemployed , health care ; hurt poor people
he says lawmakers ' moves aim to disenfranchise voters . tax changes target poor
@entity172 : lawmakers splitting state into haves - have nots ; coalition will protest for redress
