-- @entity1 , the millionaire founder of the file - sharing website @entity4 , was released on bail wednesday after a judge said he did n't appear to have enough money to flee			1
under one of the largest anti-piracy crackdowns ever , the @entity9 @entity8 is seeking to have @entity1 , also known as @entity1 , and three co-workers extradited to face charges including conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit copyright infringement			1
last month , @entity9 authorities shut down @entity4 's websites and announced indictments against @entity1 and six other people connected to the site , accusing them of operating an " international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works			1
" they say @entity4 generated more than $ 175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships			0
the @entity32 police arrested @entity1 , a @entity34 citizen who has residency in @entity32 and @entity36 , and the other three at the @entity9 government 's request			1
@entity4 's lawyers have denied the charges , and online activists have rallied to the site 's defense			2
an initial effort by @entity1 's lawyers to obtain bail last month was denied , with the judge at the time concluding that flight risk remained " a real and significant possibility			1
" but on wednesday , district judge @entity50 said that " fresh and new " information had emerged since and that there was no longer " just cause " to keep @entity1 in custody , providing satisfactory bail conditions were imposed			2
in his 13 - page decision , @entity50 noted that : -- @entity4 's chief financial officer has filed an affidavit supporting @entity1 's contention that he has no money to flee ; -- he has only two passports ( one @entity63 and one @entity34 ) , not three , as previously asserted ; -- the @entity9 has extradition treaties with @entity34 and @entity63 ; -- no steps have been taken to re-establish the shuttered business ; -- no new evidence has been uncovered ; -- some of @entity1 's business associates facing the same charges have been granted bail ; -- an extradition hearing likely will not occur before july , an " effectively punitive " period of time , despite the fact that no criminal conduct has been established			1
@entity1 's release on bail comes after the @entity9 authorities added charges and broadened their case against the defendants last week			2
the other charges that the accused face include conspiracy to commit money laundering and criminal copyright infringement			1
@entity1 holds a @entity34 passport and two @entity63 passports , under the names of @entity1 and @entity1			0
prosecutors had said that the multiple passports , as well as bank accounts and credit cards from various countries linked to different names , showed that he presented a flight risk			1
@entity1 " legally changed his name on two occasions and each passport was obtained in his legal name at that time , " the judge wrote			2
" it is the applicant 's understanding that the first @entity63 passport in the name of @entity1 would have been canceled when he applied for a new passport from @entity63 in the name of @entity1			0
suprisingly , no inquiries have been made of the @entity63 authorities to confirm this			0
" in addition , @entity1 " is entitled to hold both his @entity34 passport and his dotcom @entity63 passport , " he said			0
@entity50 said @entity1 , at the time of his arrest , had 59 credit or bank cards under 13 names in his possession , 21 of them still valid			0
but the judge said @entity1 's possession of so many expired cards could indicate no more than " a degree of muddlement " in his financial affairs			2
the 38 - year - old businessman has prior convictions related to computer hacking and insider trading			0
but @entity50 noted that they were " historical , " with some of them dating to his teenage years			0
@entity1 obatined residency status in @entity32 in december 2009			1
he is married to a @entity136 woman with whom he has three children , and his wife is pregnant with twins			0
" the factors against him being a flight risk include that he would live his life as a fugitive , he would be abandoning his expectant wife and three children and he would effectively lose all the considerable assets and bank accounts in a number of countries that have been seized or frozen , " @entity50 wrote			1
" it is submitted that he has a good defense to the charges and that he has every reason to stay and fight for his family 's future and his seized assets			0
" the arrests of @entity1 and his co-workers , along with the closure of @entity4 , prompted an angry reaction from the activist hacking collective @entity161			1
after the prosecution was announced , the group took credit for temporarily crippling the @entity9 @entity8 , @entity165 and entertainment company websites			0
@entity0 's @entity167 and @entity168 contributed to this report			0

@entity1 was arrested last month in @entity32
judge finds no " just cause " to consider him a flight risk
three @entity4 co-workers were arrested with him
