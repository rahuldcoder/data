-- have you picked your jaws up off the floor yet , @entity4 ? if so , well done			0
indeed , it was probably a fairly herculean task considering all the mind - blowing revelations in " @entity10 's " twisty season 3 premiere			1
though several one - on - one scenes took @entity12 away from her trusted gladiators for much of the opener , you can be sure this thick - as - thieves crew will be facing the onslaught together in weeks to come			1
@entity0 talked with three of @entity12 's fixers — @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 — about their reactions to the premiere ( yes , even they were surprised by some things ! ) and what 's to come for @entity27 this year			1
( spoiler alert ! if you have n't seen the premiere , do n't keep reading			1
) ' ncis , ' ' @entity30 , ' ' @entity31 ' : find out what 's next in the @entity33 " it 's handled " picked up right where the season 2 finale left off — with @entity35 ( @entity36 ) under the microscope thanks to her affair with president @entity40 ( @entity39 ) going public			1
trying to cut off that problem at the pass was @entity45 black ops commander @entity44 ( @entity46 ) , a.k.a. @entity12 's dad , who had arranged a convenient international getaway			1
surprising absolutely no one , @entity12 decided to forgo the easy way out and returned to her @entity4 to fix ... herself			0
once @entity12 returned , reformed assassin and personal confidante @entity52 was a natural choice to escort his mentor back into her inner sanctum			0
" it 's a really short but really powerful scene when he 's pulling her out of the limo , " @entity19 says			1
" he 's like her watchdog			1
he 's that guy that 's always thinking about her safety and protecting her and [ making sure ] nothing bad 's going to happen to her [ because ] she 's the one that saved him			1
" but can the gladiators save @entity12 now that she 's in the sights of cold - blooded frenemy — and @entity74 's chief of staff — @entity75 ( @entity76 ) ? even @entity20 , who plays no - nonsense @entity78 employee @entity77 , was shocked when she finally saw one scene in particular play out on film			1
" we were watching the first episode where @entity75 starts the ' kill folder ' [ on @entity85 ] , " the actress remembers			0
" we 'd all forgotten about it [ since the table read ] , and we all just lost our marbles			0
" she adds , " @entity75 can be so evil — just when you think you were going to trust him ! i start to like the guy , and then he does something like that , and i 'm just like , ' you 're dead forever now ... , ' " then she laughs , " at least for another episode			0
" @entity75 is n't the only one who 's out for blood			1
@entity12 's newest acolyte , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , is still practically shaking from the adrenaline boost of her first torture session under @entity52 's tutelage			1
@entity18 admits @entity100 " got a little bit of a taste for [ violence ] in the finale , " but says , " it 's not so much that she wants to go out with a machine gun and start killing people			1
i do n't think she 's psychotic , and that 's not how i 'm playing her			2
the deal is , she has had a lot of really terrible things happen to her in her life and , for the first time in a while , she was in control of the situation and she was excelling at something and she was causing pain on somebody else			0
it 's that sense of control that gives her a high , that forces her to be addicted to that feeling			2
" @entity36 on how she stays grounded amid ' scandal ' craze even @entity18 admits how wild @entity100 's change in character has been			1
" i can not go back and watch the pilot because we 've come such a long way , and such a 180 has happened , and she 's grown so much and changed so much as a person , " she admits			2
" this season is a big mix. @entity138 is always saying , ' oh , that 's @entity100 ! oh , that 's @entity141 ! ' now it 's really combining together			1
" for @entity52 , though , @entity100 's new empowerment spells trouble			2
he considers himself a murder - and - torture addict and now fears he 's enabling @entity146			2
@entity152 previews , " that 's kind of what he 's dealing with in the first few episodes : him having created this monster			2
he knows how seductive it was for him and how caught - up in it he got , in that dark world			0
he 's afraid she 's too far gone now , and he does n't know what to do about it			2
" however @entity52 chooses to confront @entity100 's growing bloodlust , it 's safe to say " @entity146 " — as shippers affectionately refer to the friendship — will never be the same			2
according to @entity19 , that 's not necessarily a bad thing : " their relationship has shifted			1
it 's changed a little bit			2
it 's exciting what 's coming down the pike			0
" @entity20 's character is also facing a relationship in flux with on - and - off lover @entity176 ( @entity177 ) , the newly appointed @entity178 attorney for the @entity179			1
the pair had only a brief encounter in the premiere , with @entity176 telling @entity77 to " return [ his ] calls , " but @entity20 promises , " it 's not over between @entity77 and @entity176			1
the best way to describe it [ is ] , @entity77 and @entity176 have never done normal — they 've never actually been on a proper , normal date			0
there 's definitely an attempt at normal [ in coming episodes that ] will be interesting for fans			0
it 's been interesting to play			0
they really are two people who fit			0
they 're a good match together because they 're both sort of misfits in a way			0
" seeing as the @entity202 " is packed with misfits and machinations , @entity77 and @entity176 's showmance will be in fine company — starting with a @entity52 - heavy episode next week			0
" scandal " returns next thursday at 10 p.m. et on @entity208			0
