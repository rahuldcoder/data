@entity0 -- @entity2 have a @entity4 problem			1
only about 6 % of @entity4 voters agree that the @entity2 is the party most concerned for their interests			1
nearly half choose the @entity7 as the party most concerned for them			0
some @entity2 are advancing a @entity4 solution : nominate a latino for vice president in 2012			1
the name most often mentioned is that of @entity14 , the junior senator from @entity15			1
there 's a lot to admire about @entity14			1
his personal rise from hardscrabble immigrant roots confirms @entity22 ' highest hopes for the country			0
but @entity2 make a big mistake if they imagine that the @entity14 choice will gain them many @entity4 votes			1
@entity14 is the wrong answer to the wrong question			1
here 's the right question : why do @entity30 tilt so heavily @entity7 ? poor people in general tilt @entity7 -- and @entity30 are more likely than other @entity22 to be poor			0
under the @entity34 's newest and most sophisticated measure of poverty , some 28 % of @entity30 count as poor , a higher proportion than among african - americans , 25 % of whom are poor			0
more than one - third of @entity4 voters fear their home could go into foreclosure			1
only 23 % of @entity30 describe their personal finances as " excellent " or " good , " compared to 37 % of the total @entity22 population			0
of @entity30 who are legal residents of the @entity22 , 28 % lack health insurance			0
in the total @entity22 population , only 17 % lack health insurance			0
is it realistic to imagine that a @entity47 - speaker on the national ticket will overcome these hard economic facts ? as glibly as pundits talk about " hispanic voters , " it 's important to remember that a majority of @entity22 hispanics identify themselves -- not as " hispanics " -- but as @entity55 , @entity56 , and so on			2
almost two - thirds of @entity22 @entity4 are @entity55 - @entity22			1
as @entity60 recently pointed out on @entity61 , the values and interests of @entity55 - @entity22 do not align naturally with those of @entity56 like @entity14			2
" thanks to the @entity64 , which was enacted in 1966 -- or four years after @entity14 's grandfather came to the @entity22 -- @entity67 refugees who flee the @entity68 and reach the @entity22 shoreline have a clear path to legal residency and eventual citizenship			2
@entity55 immigrants are n't so fortunate			2
so when @entity67 - @entity22 do what @entity14 has done since arriving in the @entity76 16 months ago and take a hard line against illegal immigration , @entity74 and @entity55 - @entity22 have been known to cringe			2
after all , that 's easy for them to say			0
" under these circumstances , @entity2 should be cautious about assuming that they can sway @entity4 votes with the symbolic politics of a @entity14 nomination			1
what would work better are policy changes and message changes to win back the 9 points worth of @entity4 votes that @entity2 lost between the elections of 2004 and 2008			1
@entity2 tend to assume that immigration is the issue that most moves @entity4 voters			1
if that assumption was ever true , it is not true now			0
latinos were hit hard by the economic crisis that began in 2007			0
they were promised " hope " by @entity97 in 2008			0
those hopes have been largely disappointed			0
but what are @entity2 offering instead ? and to the extent that symbolic politics can sway votes , @entity2 should be looking to groups more receptive to the core @entity2 message than @entity55 - @entity22 are likely to be			1
the @entity107 - @entity22 population is also growing fast , and many @entity107 groups -- @entity109 - @entity22 and @entity110 - @entity22 to name only two -- are gaining their success in small business			0
they are natural targets for @entity2 recruitment			2
in @entity117 , @entity118 , and @entity119 , conservative parties have done well with these immigrant groups			0
in fact , in the federal election of 2010 , @entity119 's conservatives won a plurality of the vote among voters who spoke @entity127 at home			2
for these voters , inclusion does matter			2
symbols of inclusion can work			0
as symbols go , @entity133 gov. @entity132 is a doozy : a brilliant policy mind with an inspirational life story who has run an effective government in corruption - tainted @entity133			1
he can talk data with @entity141 and credibly sit at the kitchen tables of the struggling middle class			0
which leads to this thought : @entity132 for vice president ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			1

@entity149 : some *advocate* @entity2 should run a @entity4 **candidate** for @entity153
he says @entity2 has a problem with @entity4 voters , but *picking* @entity14 wo n't change that
@entity149 says *republicans* are more likely to gain votes with @entity132 as **candidate**
