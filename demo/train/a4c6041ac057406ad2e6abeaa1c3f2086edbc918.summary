stimulus package to spur investment in the country 's creaking infrastructure and shore up ailing investor confidence in the world 's second - largest emerging market economy			1
in the first of what are expected to be a series of announcements in the coming weeks , ms @entity1 said the government would sell concessions in nine highways and 12 railways before moving onto other areas of infrastructure			1
" we are starting with railways and roads but obviously we will take care of airports , ports and waterways , " ms @entity1 told a gathering of politicians and leading businessmen in @entity25 ­ lia			2
@entity2 's economy has slowed to a crawl over the past 12 months as inadequate infrastructure including roads and ports and a shortage of skilled labour has raised costs and stifled industry			1
the economy expanded 7.5 per cent in 2010 , the fastest pace in more than two decades , but last year slowed to 2.7 per cent and this year is expected to grow 2 per cent or less			0
among the initiatives , the government will sell rights for private companies to operate 7,500km of roads and 10,000km of railways			0
the measures would double the capacity of the country 's main highways , transport minister @entity48 said at the event			1

@entity56 would be largely at favourable terms from the state development bank , @entity58			0
@entity59 , senior credit strategist for @entity60 at @entity61 , said the move was a step in the right direction , with infrastructure bottlenecks posing one of the biggest obstacles to faster growth in @entity2			1
but he added : " the easy thing is making the announcements , the harder thing is execution , and the track record not just of @entity2 but of @entity60 countries in general is pretty poor on infrastructure			1
" the cost of exporting a container from @entity2 is more than double that of @entity79 and 1.5 times that of @entity80 while the country 's ports are notorious for delays			1
but other analysts hailed it as the start of a new era for @entity2			2
" with a government willing to make politically difficult decisions ... this downturn may end up being a boon for @entity2 in its quest for global economic status , " @entity88 , the political intelligence agency , said			0
the centre - left coalition government led by ms @entity1 's @entity96 has traditionally been opposed to privatizations			1
but she has proven pragmatic in the face of infrastructure bottlenecks			0
earlier this year , her government awarded projects to redevelop and operate three major airports to private sector - led consortia in a bid to speed up preparations for the soccer @entity107 in 2014 and the @entity108 two years later			0
" since last sunday , we have been an ' @entity108 country ' , " ms @entity1 said on wednesday			2
