-- @entity1 , 71 , of @entity2 , @entity3 , says the post office lost something that could cost her more than just a buzz			1
she could lose her eyesight			0
six metal tins packed with medical marijuana joints -- 1,800 in all -- are in transit somewhere with her name on it			2
that 's enough for up to 10 potent smokes a day for six months			0
it 's a prescription she receives twice a year to treat her glaucoma			2
" i just do n't know what to do , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 says she 's one of four remaining patients getting pot for free as part of a federal government program called @entity23 , developed in the 1980s			1
her attorney says the cannabis is grown in a government lab at the @entity27			0
" it relaxes the eye so whatever excess fluid can get through , " @entity28 said			0
she usually flies back to @entity32 , her former home , to pick up the pot from her eye specialist at the @entity35			0
but this time , the medicine was delayed , and she had to fly home without it			0
her attorney , @entity39 of @entity40 , @entity41 , accepted the pot for her and shipped it as next - day delivery through the @entity44 on march 17			1
it never arrived at @entity1 's @entity3 home			1
" i spent $ 120 for ( shipping ) three cartons , " @entity39 said			2
on monday , @entity49 started calling the postal service			0
he discovered he mislabeled the zip code			1
it was off by one digit and the shipment was sent to the post office in @entity56 , @entity57 , about 850 miles away from @entity2 , @entity3			1
" i called consumer affairs ' lost and found , the complaint and tracking departments , and everyone says that they 're looking , " @entity39 said			1
now , more than a week after the packages were mailed , there has yet to be a whiff of the missing cartons			0
" i find it fascinating that the post office can tell me because of their tracking that it was misrouted and can acknowledge that it went to the wrong place , but they ca n't tell me what happened to it after that , " @entity39 told @entity0			1
" @entity39 said the contents are not marked on the outside of the cartons			2
inside , he included letters explaining why the rolled joints are stacked within the shiny metal tins			0
" as each day goes by and it does n't show up , i just get more confused			0
it 's just very exasperating , " @entity1 said			2
@entity1 has her own website and sometimes lectures on the medical need for marijuana			1
after spending hours on the phone with the postal service , @entity49 sent a letter to the @entity89 on thursday asking for help			0
in the letter , he wrote that he hopes " the @entity89 recognizes it is not in the public interest to have marijuana missing in the @entity100 mails , " and adds the need to " make a record of this loss in order to procure a new prescription			0
" contacted by @entity0 , a @entity44 spokesman said the agency is looking for the lost shipment			1
" she 's not asking for much , " @entity39 said			2
