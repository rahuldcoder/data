-- @entity2 leaders meeting in @entity3 thursday need to send @entity4 an unmistakeable signal that its military intervention in @entity7 will not be tolerated			1
the consequences of failing to act firmly would have a negative impact far beyond the @entity11 's eastern neighborhood			0
one country waiting quietly to see if @entity13 gets away with his de facto land grab in @entity15 is @entity16 , a growing military power locked in a series of territorial disputes with the countries around it			2
there is too much at stake for the lesson that borders can be unilaterally changed by force to be allowed to stand			0
an important starting point is for @entity11 policy makers to understand that @entity4 acted out of weakness rather than strength			1
faced with the loss of a friendly regime in his own back yard , @entity13 lashed out without any real thought for the consequences			1
there are already signs that he realizes he overplayed his hand			0
in his press conference on tuesday , the @entity4 president stressed the limited and temporary nature of his goals , professed friendship towards @entity7 and even expressed sympathy for the protestors who overthrew his @entity7 ally , @entity45			1
the reason for this is clear			0
@entity13 wants to rebuild his influence over @entity7 as a whole and recognizes that the occupation of @entity15 is more likely to unite the country against him			1
a second factor giving him pause for thought will have been the reaction of the markets in weakening the ruble and wiping billions from the value of @entity4 businesses			2
@entity4 's economic difficulties were already beginning to mount before this crisis broke			1
growth is stagnant and likely to remain so			0
little progress has been made in modernizing and diversifying the economy despite years of talking about it			0
net capital outflows from @entity4 run at tens of billions of dollars each year at a time when its investment requirement remains huge			2
@entity4 may find an ally in @entity16 even @entity4 's status as an energy superpower is now challenged by a combination of @entity74 shale gas and @entity11 competition measures against @entity76			1
indeed , the only metric by which @entity4 remains strong is its ability to generate scary headlines in the western media			2
these vulnerabilities give the @entity11 plenty of options for leverage over @entity4 if it chooses to use them			1
one important focus of attention should be on political and economic reform in @entity7 itself			2
stabilizing the situation , providing economic aid and encouraging free elections to choose a new government should be immediate priorities			0
assistance should also be given to help @entity7 realize its goal of energy independence from @entity4			1
work to allow the reverse flow of @entity7 's pipelines to import gas from west to east will increase supply options until measures can be taken to raise domestic production			2
reviving and completing the @entity11 's association agreement with @entity7 will be another important element			2
the aim should not be to shut @entity4 out			2
@entity7 and @entity4 have strong ties of history and culture , a fact still reflected in the preference of most @entity7 for close relations between the two countries			1
the @entity11 should be willing to talk to @entity4 about its interests in the region and the creation of a common economic space provided @entity4 ends its military intervention , restores friendly ties with @entity120 and does n't assume a right of veto over @entity7 's future			1
influence has to be earned not asserted as an attribute of @entity4 greatness			2
if @entity4 wo n't be a good neighbor , the @entity11 should help @entity7 to move on regardless			1
targeted measures aimed at the financial and personal interests of the @entity4 elite will also help to focus minds			0
we know from the @entity135 's furious reaction to the @entity74 magnitsky act that this can be an effective instrument			0
travel bans and asset freezes aimed at @entity4 officials who supported and facilitated the invasion of @entity15 should be combined with a rolling program of money laundering investigations into @entity4 financial assets held in western banks			0
action to restrict flows of western capital , limit technology transfer and toughen visa requirements would also hurt			0
perhaps the most provocative thing western governments could do would be to remind @entity4 of what it potentially stands to lose by undermining the principle of territorial integrity in relations between states			0
@entity4 has been anxious about its own internal cohesion since the break up of the @entity160			0
in addition to concerns about @entity164 and eastern @entity165 , @entity161 faces open revolt in the northern caucasus			0
upgrading diplomatic contacts with non-violent opposition groups from these regions is a message the @entity135 would understand			0
so far the measures @entity2 leaders have been prepared to discuss fall far short of what is required get @entity4 's attention			1
the suspension of trade talks that were in any case going nowhere and even cancellation of the @entity180 come under the heading of gesture diplomacy			1
the @entity184 administration has been much tougher in thinking about the kinds of sanctions that are needed			0
with deeper ties of energy and trade , @entity2 leaders feel they have more to lose and are reluctant to endanger what remains a fragile economic recovery			1
but they risk far more if nothing is done in response to a grave violation of international law			0
only a direct challenge to @entity4 's material and geopolitical interests is likely to have an impact on @entity13 's calculations			1
anything short of that will amount to a wasted day out in @entity3			0

@entity2 leaders are meeting to discuss sanctions against @entity4 over @entity7
@entity210 says @entity13 acted without thought and @entity4 's economy is weak
@entity210 says @entity4 has vulnerabilities @entity2 can leverage -- and should do so
he says gesture diplomacy will not be enough , otherwise the talks will be wasted
