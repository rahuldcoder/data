@entity0 -- @entity2 has launched three astronauts into orbit for the country 's fifth and longest crewed mission in its burgeoning space exploration program			1
the @entity9 spaceship and its launcher , a @entity13 - @entity12 rocket , blasted off from the @entity14 in the @entity15 on tuesday			1
it will dock with the @entity18 space module and the crew will transfer supplies to the space lab , which has been in orbit since september 2011			0
during the 15 - day mission , the crew will master the rendezvous and docking capabilities that are essential for the operation of a manned space platform			2
" the functionality , performance , and coordination of all systems will be evaluated during this mission , " @entity29 , a spokesperson for @entity2 's @entity30 , told a news conference on monday			1
humans in space she added that another main objective of the mission was to test technologies related to the construction of a space station , as @entity2 seeks to establish a long - term human presence in space			1
@entity2 has stepped up the pace of its space program since first sending astronaut @entity48 into orbit in 2003			1
in 2012 , it conducted 18 space launches , according to the @entity51			2
the most recent manned mission last year carried its first female astronaut and was the first to make a manual docking with the space module			2
the crew for this mission will also include a woman , @entity59 , and two male astronauts , @entity61 and @entity62			2
" these longer duration missions and space dockings are essential practice for any kind of long - term , more permanent presence in space or a mission to , say , the moon , " said @entity63 , a research fellow at the @entity65 - based @entity64			2
timeline : @entity2 's race into space growing power @entity2 's march into space underscores the country 's growing financial and military clout and has unsettled some @entity81 observers			1
a 92 - page report on @entity2 military development released by the @entity51 last month highlighted the advances in @entity2 's space capabilities			1
" @entity2 is developing a multi-dimensional program to improve its capabilities to limit or prevent the use of space - based assets by adversaries during times of crisis or conflict , " the report said			1
a spokeswoman for @entity2 's manned space missions said last year the program would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan ( us $ 6.27 billion )			1
the @entity98 closed its space shuttle program in 2011 and is no longer aggressively pursuing manned space exploration , leaving @entity101 and @entity2 as the only two countries in the world capable of independently sending humans into space			1
" in some ways , they have overtaken the @entity98 , at least temporarily , " says the @entity64 's @entity63			0
" of course , the @entity98 , and even more @entity101 , have more experience in manned space			0
@entity2 is not , at this time , capable of reaching the @entity110			0
" " but like the tortoise and the hare , @entity2 is slowly catching up with the @entity98			0
" however , @entity63 says that @entity2 is not engaged in a space race with the @entity98			1
rather : " they have a long - term plan , and they are sticking to it			0
" private space ambitions companies like @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 are scrambling to develop private sector spacecraft and operate in what has previously been the exclusive preserve of sovereign nations			0
@entity2 is not part of the project that maintains the @entity128 ( @entity128 ) , which currently orbits the @entity130 conducting experiments in a range of fields , from physics to astronomy			0
the @entity128 is a joint venture between @entity136 , @entity101 's @entity137 space agency , @entity139 's @entity138 , the @entity140 and the @entity142 @entity141			0
@entity2 views its multi-billion dollar space program as a way to raise prestige both domestically and abroad			1
this is the first high - profile space launch since new leader @entity147 assumed the presidency in march			0
public reaction to the planned mission was mixed , with some users of the @entity154 - like @entity153 platform wishing the astronauts well , while others said the resources were best used on the ground			0
" our country may be lagging behind in other areas , but @entity2 has great achievement in aerospace technology , " said one user with the handle @ @entity161			2
" the government should spend more money to help those of lowest social status , " said another user identified as @ @entity167			0
