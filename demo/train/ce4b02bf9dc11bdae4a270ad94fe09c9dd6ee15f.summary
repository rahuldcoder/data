-- the @entity1 tried mightily to come together			2
last week brought tantalizing hints the nine justices could speak as one on the thorniest of issues -- on cellphone privacy and presidential recess appointments			1
but in the end came a familiar conservative - liberal split on the last , and perhaps most - watched case of the term ending this week			1
that was an @entity14 challenge over religious liberty and reproductive choice			1
when the stakes are highest , especially on cases with a distinct political bent , old habits die hard			1
" there 's no doubt this is a closely divided @entity1			1
that 's been true for decades , and it 's no less true now , " said @entity23 , publisher of @entity24			1
" you have five sold conservative votes in the majority , but @entity30 , who is the least conservative among them , does on occasion switch sides and join his more liberal colleagues			2
there 's a constant battle going on in these ideological fights			1
" all together now from affirmative action , campaign spending , public prayers , and labor union power -- the justices continue to stack their docket with cases spanning a range of constitutional and legal questions			1
what was surprising was how often they agreed to agree			0
two - thirds of the 72 cases fully decided this term were unanimous , the highest percentage in years			1
most were low - profile disputes , but did include : * a shockingly united rebuke of law enforcement discretion to search for incriminating data in cellphones and smartphones , when suspects are first arrested			1
the simple answer : " get a warrant			0
" * a narrowly - drawn defeat for the @entity64 administration on recess appointments , those named to temporarily fill high government positions without @entity69 confirmation			1
@entity70 must define when it 's in recess , not the administration			1
also amazing was that only 14 percent of the court 's decisions were 5 - 4 , with just four of those 10 splits along the liberal - conservative marker			1
but that included four of the most contentious of petitions : * the big one on @entity14 gave some for - profit businesses discretion to deny certain birth control insurance based on religious objections centered around anti-abortion beliefs			1
* allowing civic prayers in local town meetings , even if the ceremonies are predominantly offered by @entity87 citizens			0
* another setback for campaign finance reform , this time giving individual political donors the power to throw more money to more candidates in a federal elections			0
* a defeat for public sector labor unions over dues for non-members			0
the swing vote as usual , @entity30 was the swing vote in the majority in those cases			1
chief justice @entity103 has made no secret of his desire to foster as much unanimity among his benchmates as possible			0
" there are clear benefits to a greater degree of consensus on the court , " he said just months after joining in 2005			2
" unanimity or near unanimity promote clarity and guidance for the lawyers and for the lower courts trying to figure out what the @entity1 meant			0
" the key , said @entity103 is to rule on the narrowest grounds possible , to do only " what 's necessary to decide the case			1
" it has been a most elusive goal , and has attracted a measure of bipartisan criticism			0
ruling narrowly means both sides may have reason to complain about the outcome			2
many legal observers believe the idea of consensus sounds good on paper , but is not practical given the current court 's makeup , and the sharply held views of its members , led by @entity103 himself			1
@entity141 principles will be tested mightily in coming months , as the justices begin preparing for their next term in october and what promises to be a more contentious session			0
same - sex marriage upcoming ? the justices by this time next year could be tackling the constitutionality of same - sex marriages , and whether gay and lesbians have an " equal protection " right to legally wed. federal courts around the country in the past eight months have been all but unanimous those couple do enjoy such a right			1
it seems all but inevitable the justices will have to answer the question , in what could be the defining civil rights ruling of this generation			2
but wait , there is more			0
" not only are the justices likely to get the equal protection question over same sex marriage , " said @entity23			0
" but next term , they are very likely to return to the abortion question , in a case from @entity172 involving restrictions over where clinics can be located			0
and that will be a monumental fight , because @entity177 is never settled in the @entity1			0
" another @entity14 challenge , perhaps over when some @entity179 can get tax breaks and subsidies when buying insurance on the federal health exchange , may also be put on the he docket			1
confidence low a @entity187 survey released monday found @entity179 ' confidence in the @entity1 is at just 30 percent , the lowest since 1973			2
it was as high as 56 percent in the mid- 1980s			0
the numbers reflect an overall drop in confidence in the all branches of government			0
but members of the court hold fast to their belief they operate independently of public opinion , and politics			2
" i do n't think any of my colleagues , on any cases , vote the way they do for political reasons			2
they vote the way they do because they have their own judicial philosophy , " justice @entity206 told @entity0 recently			0
the five mostly conservative justices were named by @entity214 presidents , the four more liberal members by @entity217 presidents			0
that dynamic more than anything explains why the court is perceived -- rightly or wrongly -- as hopelessly divided and ideological			2
social media , the proliferation of partisan legal advocacy groups , and a corrosive political atmosphere in @entity224 all have helped to punch holes in the record and reputation of the @entity229			0
are they completely powerless to change hearts and minds ? the court 's members will tell you they ignore all that outside noise -- or try to -- and focus instead on the work			1
" people think in fixing things , that there 's a magic bullet to every problem			2
it does n't work that way , " justice @entity242 told @entity0 last year			0
" we 're trying to convince			0
and we 're trying to convince ( the public ) what we 're doing is the right thing			0
" what the @entity1 's @entity249 decision means justices strike down abortion clinic buffer zone @entity1 slows @entity254 on emissions , but largely backs its rules			2

there were signs the court could speak with a unanimous voice in key cases
but then came monday 's ruling on @entity14 and *contraception*
there were 10 cases overall where decisions came down 5 - 4
