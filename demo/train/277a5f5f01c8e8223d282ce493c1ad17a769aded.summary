most people expect to fight frigid temperatures and fierce winds as they climb @entity3			1
but a group of three climbers say they faced unexpected adversaries over the weekend while scaling the storied peak : sherpa guides			1
@entity10 authorities say they 're investigating reports that a fight broke out on saturday between the guides and the climbers , nearly 23,000 feet ( 7,000 meters ) up the world 's tallest mountain			1
" if the @entity20 hit the foreign climbers , action will definitely be taken against them , " said @entity17 , a mountaineering official in @entity18			1
the fight started after three professional climbers from @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity25 told the sherpas they wanted to climb on their own , according to @entity8 of @entity27 , the agency that is managing their climb			1
" our clients said the @entity20 manhandled them , " he said			0
a statement posted sunday on the website of @entity23 climber @entity34 gave a harrowing account , claiming that @entity20 attacked him , @entity25 climber @entity37 and @entity24 climber @entity38			2
this account said the fight broke out after @entity40 said the climbers knocked ice onto a sherpa located below them			1
" they became instantly aggressive , " the statement said , " and not only punched and kicked the climbers , but threw many rocks as well			1
" after nearly an hour , the situation calmed down , the statement said			0
" the climbers , who had been pushed away and told to hide , had regrouped and were told that if they were n't gone in one hour that they would all be killed , " the statement said			2
" the climbers packed the bare essentials and made a circuitous route back down to the base of @entity3 in heavily crevassed terrain with no rope on , feeling that given the current situation this was the safest place to be			2
" @entity10 authorities said their investigation into the report was ongoing			1
" the sherpas got angry when hit by the ice and there was a fight , " said @entity65 of the @entity66 , a group representing expedition organizers			1
in addition , he said , the climbers had been instructed not to go up while @entity20 were laying ropes , but they went ahead despite the warning			2
on monday , he said , both sides had a meeting , reconciled and agreed to go ahead with the climb			1
in their statement on sunday , the climbers said no sherpa had come forward with any evidence of injury			1
" the climbers believe that the lead sherpa was tired and cold and felt that his pride had been damaged as the three climbers were moving unroped and much faster to the side of him , " the statement said			1
" whatever the reason may be , there is no reason to instigate vigilante rule and to try and kill three visiting climbers			2
" about 4,000 people have scaled @entity3 since sir @entity98 and sherpa @entity99 first climbed the mountain in 1953			2
according to mountaineering officials , 340 foreign climbers from about 30 expeditions have been given permission to climb @entity3 this year with about the same number of high - altitude sherpas set to assist them			1
the majority of climbers are on commercial expeditions and are aided by @entity20 to reach the summit			0
sherpas from different expeditions put down ropes to the summit and later , other climbers hold on to them to scale the mountain			0

in a @entity128 post , @entity126 described what it called a " shocking scene " on the mountain , sparking debate among readers over whether the @entity20 or the climbers were responsible			0
one post on @entity137 's website described the incident as " an inauspicious start to the spring climbing season on @entity141			0
" in another post , a guide said mistakes were likely made on both sides , but that those responsible for the violence should be prosecuted			0
" @entity3 is a mountain where people pour an incredible amount of passion and money into their efforts			0
this is true for professional and recreational climbers , and for @entity8 who earn most or all of their family 's annual income in these two months on the mountain , " guide @entity159 wrote			0
" the constant pressure to break records , attempt new routes , and be the strongest , whether for personal pride , sponsors , future job offers , or media , can cloud the purity of our climbing here			0
and these pressures can lead to disagreements , arguments , and hurt feelings			0
but none of these pressures should be allowed to lead to violence , or to breaking the essential bonds that tie climbers to each other , " @entity159 added			0
