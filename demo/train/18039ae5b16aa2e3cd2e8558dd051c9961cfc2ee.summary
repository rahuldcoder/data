-- @entity1 and @entity2 , known for their maniacally inventive manipulation of action figures on " @entity6 , " now want the viewing public to have a similar sense of control over a real person			1
their vision arrives in the form of " @entity14 , " a new web series that takes the standard reality format and adds to it an element of interactivity , possibly creating a novel form of entertainment in the process			1
@entity1 and @entity2 are joined in the venture by " the bachelor " director @entity24 , former president of @entity27 , @entity28 , commercial director @entity29 and the full - service video network @entity30			1
the premise of " @entity14 " is simple : for six weeks , the life of an unemployed 20 - something named @entity35 is documented and streamed live on the internet for 18 hours a day			1
the hook is that he 's agreed to relinquish his own free will for that of the collective , meaning viewers can vote on just about everything he does			0
they 'll decide what he eats , where he goes , who he dates , even the frequency and duration of his workouts , all in real time			0
to some , this might sound like an opportunity for a bunch of web - trolling sadists to anonymously mess with a stranger , but @entity1 and @entity2 's intentions seem genuinely benevolent			1
@entity35 's at a cross-roads in his life , does n't have a job , a girlfriend or an abundance of accomplishments , and he 's basically not sure what to do with himself			2
the hope is that viewers will help him figure that out , that the wisdom of the crowd will point him in the right direction			0
it helps that @entity35 's a likable guy , as his success will probably depend on whether or not the voters are pulling for him			2
the show 's essentially a character study , but not only of @entity35			0
it 's the general character of the audience , or people in general , that will be revealed most tellingly , based on how they treat him			0
lastly , it 's worth noting that " @entity14 " is much less filtered than other reality shows			2
nothing much happens at times , but that 's almost preferable to the overly - contrived situations that typify rest of the genre			0
as we watch @entity35 make breakfast , click a mouse or sit in a chair , we 'll be surprised most of all by the fact that we 're still watching , but @entity1 and @entity2 understand that even the most mundane moments can become fascinating from a voyeuristic distance .			1
