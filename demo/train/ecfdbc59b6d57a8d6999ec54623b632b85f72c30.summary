gov. @entity0 has been speaking in @entity2 recently , and he startled quite a number of people in the @entity5 when he talked about " no - go zones " in @entity7 , places where @entity9 law trumps @entity7 law			1
he announced confidently to a group that included a number of @entity7 parliamentarians that the police in the @entity7 do n't dare to tread in these zones , where @entity9 law is widely used			1
" @entity17 establish enclaves and carry out as much of @entity9 law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home , " he said			1
this is the sort of ill - informed fantasy that plays well in certain right - wing circles			0
this probably works for @entity0 back home in @entity29			1
oddly enough , @entity30 got into trouble recently on the " no - go zone " nonsense , too , as when @entity34 , a so - called terrorism expert , explained to the @entity37 masses that @entity38 , a major @entity7 urban center , was populated entirely by @entity17 and that " non-muslims just simply do n't go in			1
" @entity7 prime minister @entity40 correctly labeled him " a complete idiot , " and @entity34 's remark caused a spokesperson for the network to admit that @entity47 " no - go zones " do n't actually exist , not in @entity7 , not in @entity45			1
needless to say , there are places where a lot of @entity47 immigrants live in close proximity , and outsiders might feel uncomfortable walking around			0
the same would be true for parts of @entity56 where you might feel uncomfortable walking around if you were , say , black or white -- it would depend on the neighborhood			0
( an @entity37 colleague of mine recently told me that her sons , in their 20s , often feel threatened in white neighborhoods , and i do n't doubt the truth of this			0
) it 's not unusual for socio - economic , even racial or ethnic , groups to cluster			1
my own grandparents came to the @entity56 as immigrants in 1912 , and they lived for some years in @entity74 ghettos in @entity75			0
most immigrant groups start in ghettos somewhere , and many of them never get out			0
but the question of @entity9 law is interesting			1
unofficial @entity9 courts will be found in @entity45 , here and there			1
but these arbitration bodies do n't trump the legal system of the country where they occur			0
an article in @entity88 noted , in fact , that there have long been rabbinical courts in @entity93 neighborhoods in @entity7 -- not a dissimilar sort of thing			1
there are even places in the @entity56 where @entity98 can work out their disputes in a kind of extrajudicial manner			0
family law , for instance , is often the issue here , and there are cultural values that play into the need for this kind of culturally inflected arbitration			0
that in some @entity47 neighborhoods there might be an accommodation to @entity9 law seems not surprising , and this does n't mean that sooner or later we can expect adulterous women to be stoned to death in @entity38 or thieves to have their hands lopped off in @entity2			1
blasphemy will not soon lead to the gas chamber in @entity45 -- indeed , capital punishment is not legal in any @entity45 country ( or any civilized country , for that matter , except for the @entity56 )			0
getting back to gov. @entity0 , one has to wonder what prompted his ignorant outburst			1
was this a lame attempt to play into the broad public fears of radical @entity133 that have arisen in the wake of the @entity136 killings ? if so , that 's not good enough for a politician with any shred of integrity			2
in my view , @entity0 immediately disqualified himself from ever holding a national political office by making such a bizarre statement , though it has n't stopped any number of @entity37 politicians with bizarre notions from winning major national offices in the past			2
such behavior does , however , embarrass this country in the court of world opinion			0
the @entity7 , and most @entity45 countries , have struggled to accommodate @entity47 immigrants , but they have nevertheless welcomed them in large numbers			2
for the most part , these immigrants have behaved well , despite the fear of their traditions and beliefs that leads to crazy exaggerations by politicians such as @entity0			2
there have been isolated and gruesome incidents of terrorism -- the murder of a @entity7 soldier , @entity170 , in the spring of 2013 comes to mind , or the vicious attacks in @entity2 of july 7 , 2005 , which left 52 dead and over 700 injured			2
the @entity7 have had to confront terror , and they 've done so without vilifying large parts of their own population			2
indeed , they 've been forced to come to terms with what i would call @entity182 -- the old imperial feeling that nobody who is not @entity7 can possibly lead a civilized way of life			2
( as @entity56 , of course , we struggle with our own feelings of exceptionalism , preferring to think that our ways are always the best and truest ways			0
) @entity0 was apparently on a 10 - day " fact finding " mission designed to bolster his credentials for a possible run at the @entity195 in 2016			1
he 's not as stupid as he sounds , in fact			0
( indeed , he was a @entity198 at @entity199 , where he must have learned something			0
) let 's hope that he is a quick study , and that he learns how not to say idiotic things in public that cause a good deal of offense , if not harm , to unsuspecting people , fueling hatred rather than coming to terms .			1

in @entity7 , gov. @entity0 speaks of " no - go zones , " places where @entity9 law *supposedly* trumps @entity7 law
@entity217 says the @entity219 *governor* , on a fact - finding mission , needs to get his facts straight
let 's hope @entity0 learns how not to say idiotic things that cause a good deal of offense or harm , @entity217 says
