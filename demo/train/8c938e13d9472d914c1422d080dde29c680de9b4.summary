@entity0 , @entity1 -- the ancient town of @entity0 has long been a draw for visitors to @entity1 's picturesque west coast			1
home to a fascinating history , it is believed to have been the first @entity11 city and can be dated as far back as 7000 bc. but these days @entity12 ( or @entity0 as it is more commonly known in @entity13 ) dances to a very different tune			0
every summer a 600 strong production crew comes together to put on the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , transforming the @entity18 town into an unlikely haven for music lovers			1
this year 's event witnessed a record number of artists on stage in one night -- a testament to how popular and ambitious the event has become			1
" @entity1 and this particular venue , for those who have experienced it , has a particular aura , " said @entity27 , the festivals producer and artistic director since 2003			1
for @entity27 , the festival is a full time job , which he and his core team spend all year working on without pay			0
it 's this passion and commitment that has allowed them to convince international stars like the @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 to perform at @entity0			1
" artists do talk to each other , so each one who came here over the past 13 years has become our best ambassador			1
" artistic roots @entity16 first began in the 1960s and ran periodically through the next four decades before becoming an annual fixture since 2003			1
the spectacular setting backlit by a 12th - century castle has become the event 's defining feature			2
but putting on the show does n't come without its challenges			0
" we 're in the site that 's 2,500 years old so each time you need to use a hammer , you have to get proper written authorization from the @entity67 and stuff because it 's very much a protected site , " @entity27 said			2
ancient artifacts are n't the only obstacles			0
putting world - renowned artists on show is an expensive business			2
@entity27 describes how this year 's festival will cost between $ 4 million and $ 4.5 million			0
sponsors and public funds take care of $ 1.5 million worth of this cost meaning the extra $ 3 million must be met ticket sales			0
just to break even on expenses , therefore , the event has to sell 40,000 tickets			2
whereas most other festivals rely on ticket sales for a third of their income , in @entity0 they make up 75 % of revenues			0
regional unrest then there 's the difficulty of bringing international musicians and fans to a country that has experienced its fair share of turmoil in recent years			2
visitor numbers have been dipping since the war in neighboring @entity101 began three years ago			2
" we 're relying almost solely on locals ( for ticket sales ) , " @entity27 explained			0
2014 headline act @entity105 , a @entity1 singer and composer , led an ensemble of 160 musicians			1
he spoke of the concerns of his fellow artists on visiting and performing in his country			0
" i always play with large orchestras around the world , " @entity105 said			0
" however , here in @entity1 in these difficult situations to be able to carry out this sort of work is not easy			1
" people come warily because maybe something will happen , an explosion , so it was difficult			0
" fortunately for @entity27 and @entity105 , this year 's event has been a success despite all of the difficulties entailed with staging such a sizable event in this part of the world			1
" we 're achieving our quantitative goals year after year because @entity1 has got a strong middle class and a strong need for cultural events , " @entity27 said but after all the drama and the stress of ensuring everything goes off without a hitch , there is now another pressing concern for the indefatigable organizers			1
how to begin preparing for next year .			0

@entity16 attracts music lovers from across the world
world famous acts like @entity146 and @entity44 have played the event over the years
*instability* in @entity1 and the wider region has caused headaches for the organizers
