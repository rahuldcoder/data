now , both the princess and her husband are under investigation for allegedly diverting public funds earmarked for a non-profit foundation for private use			1
late wednesday , the @entity10 issued a statement saying it was surprised that the judge -- who last year said in an order that there were insufficient grounds to name the princess as a suspect with preliminary charges in the case -- had changed his mind			1
in his 18 - page order wednesday , the judge said that further investigation since last year had led to the decision to bring preliminary charges			2

but the story about the @entity15 's daughter dominated the news in @entity3 and was getting prominent coverage abroad as well			2
finally , the @entity10 opted for its statement late in the day , after the prosecutors announced their move , a senior spokesman told @entity1			0
