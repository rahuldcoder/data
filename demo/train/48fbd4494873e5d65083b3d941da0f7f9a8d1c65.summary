-- if you take the long view - and by " long view " we 're talking 10 days -- there have been three distinct paths the @entity7 could have taken on @entity8			1
first , way back on august 31 , president @entity9 seemed imminently close to a strike on president @entity12 's regime			1
after @entity13 , came a detour toward seeking congressional approval			2
that effort was overwhelmingly met by the public with a " no thanks			2
" then this week , thanks to a remark by secretary of state @entity22 that may or may not have been off the cuff , @entity9 made a sharp turn -- toward diplomacy			1
for now , he 's sticking with option 3			2
@entity9 seeks support for attacking @entity8 while pursuing diplomacy during a prime - time speech to the @entity7 people tuesday , @entity9 pressed the pause button on his hard sell for a military strike , and said he 's waiting to see what kind of viable , verifiable plan @entity34 comes up with for @entity12 to give up his cache of chemical weapons			1
but @entity9 says he 'll keep @entity7 forces ready in case @entity12 's bluffing			1
call it carrot - and - stick diplomacy			2
here 's what 's on @entity9 's to - do list for the coming days			1
make plans send secretary of state @entity22 to @entity48 on thursday to meet with his @entity34 counterpart			2
the hope is that @entity22 and @entity51 can draw up a timeline for @entity8 to hand over all its chemical weapons			1
the bad news : this is a crucial meeting , because the @entity7 and @entity34 have n't always seen eye to eye			2
many of the next steps , a @entity58 official says , depend on what 's agreed upon there			2
the good news : despite a sometimes icy relationship with @entity34 , @entity22 and @entity51 have been able to work well in the past			1
the talks should last two days			0
if a deal is reached , it 's on to the @entity69 next			0
5 key themes from the @entity9 speech keep courting keep wooing a lukewarm @entity72			1
even though @entity9 asked @entity72 to postpone a vote on military action , the @entity58 will push the idea , in case diplomacy fails			1
the bad news : despite bending the ears of 93 senators and more than 350 members of the @entity58 since friday , lawmakers were n't flocking to @entity82			0
a @entity0 tally showed there was growing dissent in both chambers			0
the good news : some are slowly coming around			0
a bipartisan group of eight senators is working on an alternative resolution that , according to @entity93 sen. @entity92 , will include " guidelines , reporting process and benchmarks that have to be met " before letting the @entity7 unleash its military might			2
read the speech set a deadline how long should @entity12 get to comply ? in his speech tuesday night , @entity9 did n't specify			1
the bad news : no one 's quite certain			0
after meeting with @entity9 on tuesday , sen. @entity103 said the president " asked for some time to work things out -- a matter of days into next week			1
" sen. @entity107 said , " i do n't know if he put a specified period on it			0
he thought it could be fairly short			0
" and @entity22 said , " the president will decide what he thinks is the timeframe that he is prepared to live with			0
" the good news : @entity116 rep. @entity115 of @entity117 said he was working on a version of a resolution that would authorize a military response if diplomacy does n't produce an acceptable result in 30 days			2
delegate to the @entity69 @entity9 says this last - ditch diplomacy pitch will give @entity69 inspectors time to issue their report on the august 21 incident			1
the @entity7 and its allies claim that the @entity12 regime used poison gas on rebel strongholds that day , killing more than 1,400 people			0
the bad news : on september 1 , the @entity69 said the report would be complete in two or three weeks			0
later , it said it did n't know how long it 'll take			0
the good news : @entity136 is pushing for a @entity138 resolution that would give @entity8 15 days to declare all its chemical weapons , according to @entity140			1
be wary @entity34 has agreed to play middleman to defuse this crisis			0
@entity8 says it 's on board with @entity34 's offer , and will turn over its chemical weapons stockpiles to international control			1
@entity9 calls this an encouraging sign			1
but , he warned , " it 's too early to tell whether this offer will succeed , and any agreement must verify that the @entity12 regime keeps its commitments			0
" the bad news : it 's unclear whether @entity34 is serious or stalling			0
on tuesday , @entity34 canceled a @entity138 meeting that it had called , and rejected an initial proposal by @entity136 for the framework of a resolution			2
the good news : @entity160			0
maintain pressure the @entity7 military will maintain its " current posture to keep the pressure on @entity12 and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails , " @entity9 said tuesday night			1
this means the aircraft carrier @entity169 that 's in the @entity170 with destroyer ships nearby will stay put			0
the bad news : @entity34 president @entity174 says that has to change			0
" you ca n't really ask @entity8 , or any other country , to disarm unilaterally while military action against it is being contemplated , " @entity174 said in an interview with a @entity34 television network			1
the good news ( according to the @entity7 ) : @entity22 said the looming threat of a strike will prod @entity8 to play nice			1
" nothing focuses the mind like the prospect of a hanging , " he told lawmakers tuesday			0
the bad news ( again ) : a @entity0 / @entity192 poll released monday found 59 % of respondents opposing congressional authorization of military action , while 72 % said @entity7 strikes would achieve no significant goals			1
@entity0 's @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity203 @entity202 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
