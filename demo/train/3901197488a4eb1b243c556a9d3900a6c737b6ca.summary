-- a decade after @entity3 's kidnapping ended , she is sharing intimate details of her 9 - month - long nightmare			2
@entity6 , now 25 and married , spoke to @entity0 's @entity7 monday about her book " my story , " which she said tells 100 % of what happened to her			1
" i did n't just want to go 10 % and sugarcoat the rest , " @entity6 told @entity7			1
" i wanted it to be really what happened and what it was like every single day i was there , because i do n't think i 'm doing anyone any favors by sugarcoating it			1
" her motivation for opening up is the realization that people do n't often acknowledge the " just staggering " fact that one in four girls and one in six boys are sexually abused before age 18			2
" i want to reach out to those survivors and those victims , " @entity6 said			1
" i want them to know that these things do happen , but that does n't mean that we have to be defined by it for the rest of your life			2
you can move forward and you can be happy			2
" abused but alive : lessons for @entity40 's survivors @entity6 's abduction @entity6 's horrific story began on the night of june 5 , 2002 , when @entity43 dragged the 14 - year - old from her bedroom in her family 's @entity47 home			1
" to me , in my bedroom is the ultimate place in safety , " she said			2
" i mean , i felt like that was the safest place in the world for me , so waking up in the middle of the night in my own bedroom having this strange man standing over me , someone i did n't recognize , not only that but having a knife being held to my throat , i was terrified			2
i had grown up in a very happy home and i really did n't know what the definition of fear was until that moment			2
that brought whole new meaning			2
" the street preacher threatened the child unless she left with him quietly , she said			2
" he said ' i have a knife at your neck , do n't make a sound , get up and come with me , ' " @entity6 told @entity7			1
" and then i remember getting up and going with him , and then on the way through my house he bent over to my ear again and said ' if you make any sound , if you do anything that causes any attention or causes someone to come , i not only will kill you , but i will kill anyone who tries to stop me			2
' " @entity6 described the first hours of her ordeal , when she was " praying so hard for an escape			1
" " i kept looking , i kept waiting for something to happen , for some way for me to get away , " she said			0
" i kept looking and it did n't happen			0
when i did n't see an escape route , i thought ' oh , my goodness , i 'm going to be raped and then i 'm going to be murdered , because that 's what happens to all of the other kids i 've ever seen on the news who had been kidnapped			1
" @entity43 forced her to hike with him for hours that morning , away from her home , she said			0
" i remember stopping him and asking him ' well , if you 're going to rape and kill me , could you please do it here ? ' because , in my mind , i wanted my parents to know what had happened to me , " she said			0
" i wanted them to know that i had n't run away , that this was n't my choosing , i was n't upset with them			0
i wanted them to know what had happened to me			0
" @entity43 's response was chilling			0
" i remember he just looked back at me and said , ' oh , i 'm not going to rape and kill you yet			1
' and then we kept going and i remember we got a little further and i stopped him again and i said ' well , do n't you realize what you 're doing , i mean , if you get caught you 'll spend the rest of your life in prison ? ' and he looked at me again and he said , ' well , i know exactly what i 'm doing and i know what the consequences are			0
the only difference is i 'm not going to get caught			0
' " after several hours , they arrived in a mountainside camp where @entity43 's wife , @entity125 , was waiting			0
" i was terrified when i got to the camp , but the scariest thing about the camp was this woman , " she said			0
" i remember she came out and she had on robes and she had on a headdress and she came up to me and she hugged me			0
but this hug was not comforting			0
i mean , if hugs could speak this hug would have said , ' you 're mine , you will do exactly what i tell you to do			0
' " lessons from ' @entity139 ' : never give up nine months of terror the constant sexual abuse by @entity43 began that day			1
" the next nine months , my days consisted of being hungry , of being bored to death because he talked nonstop always about himself , " she said			1
" i mean , talk about self - absorbed			0
and then my days consisted of being raped			1
i mean , not just once , multiple times a day			1
" while @entity6 's story is about hope and survival , the details are filled with despair			1
" every time i thought ' ok , this is rock bottom , ' i mean , my pajamas have been taken away from me and i 'm being forced to wear this nasty robe , the next thing i knew they 'd say , ' we 're going to have you go naked now , ' or i had been forced to drink alcohol , which i had never done before , " she told @entity7			0
" i would throw up and i would pass out and when i 'd wake up i 'd find that my face and my hair was just crusted to the ground in vomit			0
i mean , just every time i thought it could n't get worse , something always happened			0
" @entity6 said she eventually decided she would be a survivor and she would get back to her family			1
@entity6 's rescue on march 12 , 2003 , was followed by second - guessing by people who wondered why she had n't escaped on her own			1
why had she told a detective who talked to her at a library that she was not the kidnapped girl ? in 2011 : judge sentences smart kidnapper to life in prison smart : never judge a victim " you can never judge a child or a victim of any crime on what they should have done , because you were n't there and you do n't know and you have no right just to sit in your armchair at home and say ' well , why did n't you escape ? why did n't you do this ? ' i mean , they just do n't know , " she said			0
i was a little girl			0
and i had seen this man successfully kidnap me , he successfully chained me up , he successfully raped me , he successfully did all of these things			1
what was to say that he would n't kill me when he 'd make those threats to me ? what was to say that he would n't kill my family ? " the second half of @entity6 's interview with @entity7 , in which she reveals details of how she was rescued , will air on @entity0 's " @entity203 " tuesday night			1
