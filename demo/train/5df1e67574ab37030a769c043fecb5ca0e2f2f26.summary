on march 9 , @entity1 attorney general @entity0 , the state 's @entity2 candidate for governor , appeared on a @entity6 television station and was asked a straightforward question			1
would he veto , as gov. @entity8 did last year , the @entity1 version of the @entity10 , a bill that would allowed women to file equal pay claims in state courts ? @entity0 would n't say			1
instead , he smiled and held forth for a few moments about the importance of women being paid the same wages as men			0
the campaign of his @entity22 opponent , state sen. @entity21 , quickly roared to life			2
@entity24 , who shepherded the equal pay bill through the @entity1 legislature , accused @entity0 of dodging the question and demanded a hard answer			1
@entity0 equivocated for 10 days , then said he would veto the bill , handing @entity24 fresh ammo			0
" we need a governor who will fight for economic opportunity for all @entity38 , " @entity24 said at a rally in @entity32 this week , where supporters waved campaign - sponsored signs reading # @entity35			2
" we need a governor who will fight for that regardless of someone 's gender or their race			2
" the equal pay fight has consumed the @entity1 race for a better part of a month now , injecting the @entity24 campaign with fresh energy and a much - needed dose of optimism			1
for the first time in the race , @entity24 is playing offense on a policy issue			2
the flurry of activity in @entity1 has called attention to a key issue for @entity22 candidates this midterm cycle as they try to change the subject from an unpopular president and thorny issues like the @entity65 : wage fairness for women in the workplace			1
" it 's extremely potent , " said @entity22 pollster @entity69			2
" it 's the no. 1 issue that gets single women out to vote , but it also unites men and women			2
" " we were recently conducting focus groups in @entity78 with beefy , 50 - year old , white auto workers , and one guy said , ' if the little lady does n't get paid equally , i have to get overtime , and i ca n't get that anymore , ' " @entity69 said			0
" while that might not be the most feminist articulation of the policy , men are wildly in favor of equal pay			1
" meet 10 visionary women one equal pay statistic has become a well - worn talking point for @entity22 : women earn 77 cents for every dollar a man earns			1
president @entity95 slipped the data point into his 2014 @entity98 speech when he demanded that @entity99 pass the @entity100 , which would strengthen the 1963 @entity101 signed by president @entity102			0
@entity95 called the income disparity between genders an " embarrassment " and proclaimed that " women deserve equal pay for equal work			1
" it was one of his biggest applause lines of the evening			0
@entity111 , @entity114 back @entity112 for @entity116 seats hardly new fodder for democrats the gender pay gap is not attributable to discrimination alone			2
studies show that women often take lower - paying jobs than men , and they work fewer hours			0
still , while pay disparities vary depending on the occupation -- female teachers make 91 cents on the male dollar , for instance -- men generally take home bigger paychecks than women			2
the gender pay issue is hardly new fodder for @entity22 , who have relied on women voters -- especially unmarried women -- to pull them over the finish line in recent elections			1
in the @entity142 governor 's race last fall , democrat @entity139 unleashed a sustained assault on his @entity2 opponent 's views on women 's health issues			2
@entity139 narrowly won the race -- but he won the single women demographic by a staggering 42 - point margin			0
the issue flared during the 2008 presidential campaign , when @entity95 hammered @entity152 and @entity116 @entity2 for blocking the @entity10			2
after @entity95 's victory , the legislation became the first bill he signed as president			0
the fair pay debate surfaced again in 2012 , when @entity95 's re-election campaign hammered @entity159 for dodging a question about whether he would have signed the @entity10			0
like many republicans , @entity159 said he supported the concept of equal pay but questioned whether federal legislation would solve the problem			1
but this year 's midterm election is a different beast			0
with @entity22 turnout expected to tumble in a non-presidential year , party strategists are seizing on equal pay as a way to galvanize the base , raise money and once again paint @entity2 as tone deaf on women 's issues			1
" it 's just an incredibly important issue for women , " said @entity176 , the president of @entity177 , a group that backs @entity22 women candidates			1
" we see it in our polling , but also in everyday life , that it 's an economic hurt for families			0
and right now we have a @entity2 party that is so disinterested in winning over women voters that they are floundering on no - brainer issues like supporting equal pay			1
" @entity176 pointed to a february survey by @entity194 , an @entity177 partner , that showed wide majority support among both men and women for " ending gender discrimination " in the workplace and passing the @entity100			0
poll : @entity2 has a 2014 enthusiasm advantage others trying to make equal pay an issue @entity24 is the most famous @entity206 to make equal pay a centerpiece of her campaign , but smaller - scale efforts are underway in campaigns up and down the ballot , in local and federal races			1
@entity22 @entity116 candidates in @entity2 - leaning states , such as @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 in @entity142 , and @entity218 in @entity219 , have raised the issue in campaign fundraising e-mails and list - building petitions			1
a volley of them were fired off in january , on the five - year anniversary of the @entity10 signing			0
" @entity229 had a chance to be a part of history five years ago , too , " @entity215 wrote in one fundraising e-mail chiding her @entity2 opponent			2
" instead , he did what he 's done for nearly 30 years when called upon to lead : he refused to answer -- failing to stand for @entity216 's women and families by voting against the legislation			0
" by keeping the issue in the news , @entity22 hope to benefit in the long term by showcasing @entity2 presidential hopefuls who oppose equal pay protections			1
one of them , @entity8 , vetoed the equal pay legislation that @entity24 has been touting in the governor 's race			1
this week , @entity8 called the war of words over equal pay " nonsense " -- a remark that @entity22 will almost certainly use against him if he becomes the @entity2 presidential nominee in 2016			1
several likely 2016 @entity2 candidates have come out against equal pay protections , mostly on the grounds that they would encourage lawsuits and cripple the ability of private businesses to set their own pay scales based on merit			1
yet while @entity2 in @entity260 have counseled candidates on how to speak more carefully about women 's health issues like abortion and contraception , there seems to be no messaging playbook when it comes to equal pay			1
in the heat of the last presidential race , @entity270 sen. @entity269 waved off the @entity10 as " an effort to help trial lawyers collect their fees and file lawsuits			0
" @entity216 sen. @entity277 said the @entity100 would interfere with the free market , comparing it to the way the @entity281 set the price of bread			0
on the local level , @entity2 governors like @entity8 have derided state equal pay laws as redundant given the federal protections already on the books			1
@entity292 gov. @entity291 repealed a pay discrimination law in 2012 for much the same reason			0
@entity295 , a former @entity159 campaign adviser who co-founded @entity296 , a firm that advises republicans on how to appeal to women voters , said @entity22 are using equal pay " to distract women from real issues			1
" but @entity301 urged @entity2 candidates to be more sensitive when rebutting the issue			1
" look , women view this as a problem , " she said			0
" when you talk to women , and you see this in focus groups , they feel it 's a problem			0
they have anecdotal experience , they feel it , but they do n't have very specific data			0
our party 's response has been to push back on it and say it 's a not a problem			0
" i have advised clients when you are asked your position on this , your response needs to be , ' duh , of course men and women should be paid the same for equal work ! , ' " @entity301 added			0
" this was settled law back in 1963 , and republicans voted for it			0
our party is not quick enough to push back on the fact that we already have a law in this country that requires equal pay for equal work			2
" democrats unveil agenda to keep @entity116			0
