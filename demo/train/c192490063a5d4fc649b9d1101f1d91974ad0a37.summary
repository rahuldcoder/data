-- it 's @entity3 announcement week , and if you had @entity5 , @entity6 , or @entity7 in your office pool , you 're off to a good start ( the trio will share this year 's @entity11 )			1
as we await news of the rest of the winners , here are some stories about past @entity3 laureates			1
@entity3 winners receive a medal and a cash award			1
@entity22 , winner of the 1995 @entity3 in @entity23 for his work on the theory of " rational expectations , " split his $ 1 million prize with his ex-wife			1
if there were a @entity3 for @entity30 or @entity31 , she should be nominated , based on a clause in their divorce settlement from seven years earlier : " wife shall receive 50 percent of any @entity3			1
" the clause expired on october 31 , 1995			2
had @entity22 won any year after , he would have kept the whole million			1
physicist @entity36 , whose work helped lead to the discovery of nuclear fission , was reportedly nominated for the @entity3 13 times without ever winning ( though nominations are kept secret , so we do n't know for sure )			1
this makes her the dynasty of the @entity3 scene -- that show was nominated for 24 @entity47 but never won			1
other analogies we 'd accept : the @entity49 ( 11 @entity60 nominations in 1985 , no wins ) , the @entity50 or @entity51 ( 4 @entity53 losses each without a victory ) and @entity55 ( three - time @entity57 nominee for president , losing twice to @entity62 and once to @entity63			2
people who refused the prize : @entity66 was awarded the 1973 @entity67 with @entity68 for their roles in brokering a @entity71 cease fire at the @entity72			1
citing the absence of actual peace in @entity71 , @entity66 declined to accept			2
@entity75 waved off the 1964 @entity76			0
his explanation : " it is not the same thing if i sign @entity75 or if i sign @entity75 , @entity3 winner			1
a writer must refuse to allow himself to be transformed into an institution , even if it takes place in the most honorable form			0
" afraid of @entity87 retribution if he traveled to @entity88 to claim his prize , @entity85 declined to accept the @entity90 in @entity91 , which he 'd earned for @entity92			1
the @entity93 refused his refusal			0
" this refusal , of course , in no way alters the validity of the award			0
there remains only for the @entity93 , however , to announce with regret that the presentation of the @entity103 can not take place			0
" @entity85 accepted the prize on behalf of his deceased father in 1989			1
@entity108 poet @entity107 won for @entity91 in 1918			1
he did not accept because he was secretary of the @entity93 , which awards the prize			2
he was given the award posthumously in 1931			0
this was allowed because the nomination was made before @entity107 died -- no candidate may be proposed after death			0

in 2007 , 90 - year - old professor @entity120 became the oldest person to ever win ( one - third of the @entity103 ) ; at 87 , writer @entity122 became the oldest woman ( literature )			0
@entity126 expert @entity125 -- 1993 winner of the @entity127 -- was scheduled to be a defense witness in @entity130 's murder trial			2
however , @entity130 's lawyer @entity131 felt the prosecution 's dna case was already essentially destroyed , and he did n't want @entity125 ' personal life to distract jurors ( he 'd expressed an affinity for lsd			0

@entity0 : 6 people who accidentally found a fortune 8			0
winners without the greatest reputations : @entity182 , who won in 1976 for his research in human slow - virus infections , spent 19 months in jail after pleading guilty in 1997 to charges of child molestation			2
@entity188 won in 1926 after discovering parasitic worms cause cancer -- a breakthrough that turned out to not be true			2

" what consequences will result , " he asked at the time , " when a terrorist with such a background is awarded the world 's most prestigious prize ?

@entity157 's second prize was marred by scandal			1
then a widow , @entity157 had an affair with a married scientist , @entity232 -- a former pupil of @entity233			1
love letters were involved , eventually leading to a duel between @entity232 and the editor of the newspaper that had printed them ( no shots were actually fired			0
) according to @entity3 , when it was suggested that @entity157 not accept the prize , she wrote a shrewd letter , " which pointed out that she had been awarded the prize for her discovery of radium and polonium , and that she could not accept the principle that appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by slander concerning a researcher 's private life			1
singing support -- while there 's no evidence the @entity3 judges can be swayed by theme songs , that has n't stopped @entity262 from composing one for @entity264 prime minister @entity263			1
" @entity268 " includes the lyrics , " @entity263 forever will be / @entity263 is reality / @entity263 forever ! / @entity263 gives us trust			0

the first awards show took place on december 10 , 1901			0
( these things take time to plan			0
) and in case you were wondering just how much of a say @entity269 had in the prize , here 's what he wrote in his will : " the whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way : " the capital shall be invested by my executors in safe securities and shall constitute a fund , the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind			2
the said interest shall be divided into five equal parts , which shall be apportioned as follows : one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics ; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement ; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine ; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency ; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity among nations , for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses			0
" the prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the @entity342 ; that for physiological or medical works by the @entity351 in @entity88 ; that for literature by the @entity93 in @entity88 ; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the @entity348 @entity347			0
