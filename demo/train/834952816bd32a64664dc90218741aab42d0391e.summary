in two operations nearly 3,000 miles apart , @entity1 military forces went after two high - value targets over the weekend			1
and while officials have yet to say whether the operations were coordinated or directly related , they show @entity8 's reach , capability and willingness to pursue alleged terrorists			2
one operation took place saturday in the @entity15 capital of @entity16 , when @entity1 forces captured @entity18 , an @entity19 leader wanted for his role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two @entity1 embassies in @entity23			1
as @entity18 was leaving his house for morning prayers , a group of 10 masked men surprised him , a source close to @entity15 intelligence said			1
citing @entity18 's wife , the source said the @entity19 leader tried to reach into his car to grab his gun -- but the @entity1 forces quickly snatched him			1
in the second raid , a team of @entity35 in southern @entity36 targeted the top leader of @entity39 , which was behind last month 's mall attack in @entity41			1
the @entity35 came under fire and had to withdraw before they could confirm whether they killed their target , a senior @entity1 official said			1
" one could have gone without the other , " said retired lt. col. @entity45 , @entity46 's military analyst			0
" but the fact that they did them both , i think , is a real signal that the @entity1 -- no matter how long it takes -- will go after these targets			2
" the operations were carried out even as polls show @entity1 are skittish about @entity1 military involvement in overseas conflicts			2
this means , @entity45 said , that others who might be in the @entity1 government 's cross hairs could have more reason to worry			1
speaking to reporters at the @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity1 secretary of state @entity64 said the raids ought to make clear that the @entity1 " will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror			1
" " those members of @entity19 and other terrorist organizations literally can run , " he said , " but they ca n't hide			1
" @entity78 tied to @entity1 embassy bombings @entity78 , 49 , has been high on the radar for years			1
he was on the @entity82 's " @entity83 " list , with a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction			0
he is alleged to have played a key role in the august 7 , 1998 , bombings of @entity1 embassies in @entity91 , @entity41 ; and @entity92 , @entity93			1
more than 200 people were killed and another 5,000 wounded in the @entity41 attack ; 11 died in the @entity93 incident			0
@entity78 has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to kill @entity1 nationals , murder , destruction of @entity1 buildings and government property , and destruction of national defense utilities of the @entity1			1
as early as december 2010 , @entity15 authorities told a @entity109 committee that @entity18 was living there , even providing a @entity16 address for him			0
@entity1 officials wanted @entity18 to face trial in an @entity1 court			2
but , counterterrorism analysts told @entity46 , he may not have been apprehended because of the delicate security situation in much of @entity15			0
there , ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the @entity117 -- held considerable sway since the ouster of longtime leader @entity121			0
the saturday operation was conducted with the knowledge of the @entity15 government , said one @entity1 official			2
the @entity126 said the @entity1 military was holding him in a " secure location " outside @entity15			2
" it 's a huge deal to get him , " said @entity46 's @entity130 , who has long been covering @entity19			0
" he 's a big player in @entity19 ( and ) he is in one of the key target areas , the north of @entity23			1
" beyond any psychological impact on the terrorist group , @entity18 's capture could potentially yield a wealth of information about @entity19 's plans and capabilities			0
the terrorist network has shown particular strength of late in @entity23			0
" clearly , he may have useful information about the strength of @entity19 and the @entity147 in @entity15 , " @entity130 said			0
" he is somebody who is senior within @entity19			0
he was well respected , a good operative			0
" @entity39 blamed for @entity41 mall attack @entity39 long has been a target of @entity8 as well : it was designated a foreign terrorist organization in 2008			0
the group is seeking to turn @entity36 into a fundamentalist @entity147 state , though it has carried out attacks in other @entity23 countries as well			1
the attack on @entity91 's @entity157 on september 21 thrust @entity39 into the spotlight once again			2
@entity8 vowed to support @entity41 's government after the bloody raid , which killed at least 67 people			0
the @entity39 raid took place before dawn saturday ( late friday night @entity165 ) in the southern @entity36 port city of @entity167			1
the @entity126 would only say the operation was against a " known @entity39 terrorist			0
" but town residents told @entity46 the " foreign forces " came via speed boat and stormed a house believed to be a hideout for several top militant commanders , including the group 's top leader @entity175 , also known as @entity177			1
a senior @entity1 official said the @entity35 inflicted some @entity39 casualties , and came under fire			1
they made the " prudent decision " to withdraw , and could n't confirm whether they killed their target , the official said			0
@entity185 , an @entity39 spokesman , said at least one @entity39 fighter was killed in the gunfight			2
but no @entity1 personnel were injured or killed , a @entity1 official said			2
in recent months , @entity39 's haven in south - central @entity36 has been been increasingly squeezed as @entity41 forces fight the group from the south and @entity195 forces come down from @entity196			1
at the same time , @entity39 has become even more closely aligned with @entity19			0
the two groups effectively merged last year , said @entity46 national security analyst @entity198			0
" this is a group that has adopted @entity19 's ideology wholesale , " @entity198 said			0
" the reason they attacked the mall was not only because it was @entity41 , but also because it attracted a fair number of @entity207 businessmen and others living in @entity91			0
" ' @entity209 nabbed in native @entity15 after years tied to @entity19 @entity1 officials : @entity35 launch raid on @entity39 leader			1
