-- it 's time mass worker casualties stopped seeming so commonplace			0
in april , a garment factory in @entity4 collapsed , killing more than 1,100 people			1
the previous day , cracks had been spotted in the building 's structure			0
" despite the danger , garment workers were told to report to work , " @entity9 reported			2
and on monday , more than 100 people died in a fire at a poultry factory in northeastern @entity16 , not far from @entity17 -- an area the @entity19 says is known as " the @entity20 of @entity16			1
" sounds wholesome , huh ? all but one of the gates to the burning building were locked during the blaze , trapping people inside , according to state and international media reports			1
what 's arresting is that most @entity16 experts quoted on the disaster expressed little surprise			1
many have compared this week 's fire to a similar one at a toy factory in 1993 , which killed 87 workers			1
in both cases , doors were locked			1
" ( @entity42 ) he lack of proper fire safety equipment , exits and training for workers are all too commonplace in @entity16 's factories , " the @entity39 says in a news release			1
these events should ignite international outrage			0
" what kind of country is this ? " @entity52 asked this week			2
@entity0 reporters found him outside the charred poultry plant			1
his wife was among the dead , and he was " yelling at passing vehicles and demanding answers , " the report says			0
opinion : the bloodshed behind our cheap clothes his screams must not go unheard -- both in @entity16 , a country that seems bent on profit at virtually any expense of human life ; and in the @entity69 , where disasters like these can seem so far away , or so unthinkable , that they do n't register in the public consciousness			1
there are many signs , however , that the @entity16 of today is not the @entity16 of 1993 , when the toy factory fire made headlines			1
it 's more difficult to hide in the age of social media , and @entity16 citizens are becoming more critical of their government			1
that 's clear in @entity52 's response and that of other victims ' family members , who reportedly gathered at the site of the fire to protest and insist on information			1
their questions -- why were the doors locked ? why have n't we been able to see the bodies of our family members ? -- should be answered			2
and i 'll hold out hope they will be , if not by the government than by a crusading citizen			0
the situation reminds me of @entity16 artist @entity102 's project to name the child victims of a 2008 earthquake in southwest @entity16			2
when the @entity16 government would n't release the names , @entity102 set out to gather them independently			2
the result was a fitting tribute to the dead			0
a work of art. in addition to gathering the names , with the help of volunteers , @entity102 created a wall of children 's backpacks in @entity121			0
he called it " remembering			0
" the 9,000 backpacks , viewed from afar , spelled out this sentence , which reportedly was spoken by a family member of a child who was killed in the earthquake			0
" she lived happily for seven years in this world			0
" the 1993 fire in @entity16 also spawned a hero : @entity132			1
according to a post on @entity135 , the woman was 15 when she survived the fire at a toy factory			0
she went on to become " an internationally recognized human rights leader			0
" will someone in @entity16 take up the cause of the new victims ? in @entity4 , too , there are signs the tragedy may lead to safer work conditions , but there is still much progress that needs to be made			1
at least 40 companies , including @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 have signed onto an agreement called the @entity153 in @entity4			2
the document envisions , quite reasonably , a world " in which no worker needs to fear fires , building collapses , or other accidents that could be prevented with reasonable health and safety measures			2
" it requires safety checks and the like			0
so obviously everyone signed that , right ? nope			0
@entity168 and the @entity169 are notable standouts , according to the @entity171 , which is organizing protests of those @entity174 companies			1
@entity168 and @entity169 reportedly are working on standards of their own , which could yield progress but continues to draw criticism			1
instead of following on these issues , @entity174 companies should be leading the charge for enforceable and legally binding measures that will ensure the safety of workers in all countries			2
their unwillingness to do so suggests that maybe they figure these tragedies , and their victims , will be forgotten soon enough			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity193 .			0

more than 100 people died this week at a poultry plant fire in @entity16
the doors reportedly were locked , as has happened before
@entity200 : the world must *decide* these tragedies *finally* are *unacceptable*
he says @entity169 and @entity168 should sign onto a safety accord for @entity4 workers
