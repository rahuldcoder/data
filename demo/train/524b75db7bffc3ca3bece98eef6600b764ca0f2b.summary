president @entity2 will nominate @entity3 -- a @entity4 graduate and former ceo of @entity6 -- to head the @entity7 , a @entity1 official told @entity8 on sunday			1
@entity3 would take over a troubled department			1
the @entity7 , a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full - time employees , is under fire as it deals with allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities			1
the controversy , as @entity8 first reported , involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases			1
@entity23 stepped down as head of the department in may after republicans , @entity20 and veterans ' advocacy groups joined together in calling for his resignation			1
@entity2 went before reporters to make the announcement after meeting with @entity23 , saying the retired army general told him " the @entity7 needs new leadership " to address widespread issues			1
@entity3 's mix of business experience and personal ties to the military and veteran community -- his father also served in @entity39 -- is unusual for the position but may be just what the @entity1 is looking for			1
a statement from the @entity1 touted @entity3 's 33 years at @entity6 and described his as the " perfect person to lead the @entity7 during this important time			1
" " at @entity6 , he oversaw more than 120,000 employees , with operations around the world , selling products in more than 180 countries , in more than 2.5 million stores , reaching more than 5 billion customers , " the statement reads			2
@entity3 was also recognized for his leadership , twice named as the best company for leaders by @entity55 and being named no. 1 in @entity57 's @entity56 , which annually analyzes over 2,200 companies around the world			2
in the @entity60 , @entity3 served as a captain , primarily in the @entity62 and received the meritorious service medal			2
he received a bachelor 's degree in engineering from @entity4 and an @entity66 from the @entity67			2
@entity3 will leave his home in @entity69 , where @entity6 is based , to start the complex process of untangling the @entity7 's many problems			1
" this is definitely a surprising pick			1
@entity3 is not a name that was on anyone 's radar over the last few weeks , " @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity76 ceo and founder , said in a statement			1
" his branding background may prove helpful , because there are few organizations in @entity85 with a worse reputation with its customers than the @entity7 right now			2
" he 's been away from the military for quite a while and will have to move quickly to show he is committed to and understands the post- 9/11 generation of veterans			0
we look forward to hearing from him soon and working together to support our vets , " said @entity73			0
it remains to be seen what kind of reception @entity3 will receive on @entity98 , but members of @entity100 are adamant that change is needed			2
" @entity3 is a good man , a veteran , and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector			2
with those traits , he 's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the @entity7 , " said @entity1 speaker @entity106			0
rep. @entity113 of @entity114 , chairman of the @entity115 , said in a statement to @entity8 that if @entity3 is confirmed by the @entity117 , he would inherit a department " under a specter of corruption that may very well surpass anything in the history of @entity85 government			1
" " he 'll need to root out the culture of dishonesty and fraud that has taken hold within the department and is contributing to all of its most pressing challenges			0
quite simply , those who created the @entity7 scandal will need to be purged from the system , " @entity113 said			0
sen. @entity133 , the independent from @entity135 and chairman of the @entity137 , echoed those sentiments			0
" the @entity7 needs significantly improved transparency and accountability , and it needs an increased number of doctors , nurses and other medical staff so that all eligible veterans get high - quality health care in a timely manner , " @entity133 said in a statement to @entity8			1
" i look forward to meeting with mr. @entity3 next week in order to ascertain his views on these important issues			0
" since @entity23 's resignation , the @entity1 has deepened its investigation into what went wrong at the agency			0
on friday , a @entity1 report said the agency 's health care system is in need of complete overhaul because of unresponsive leadership and a " corrosive culture " that affects the delivery of medical care			0
the report was prepared by @entity165 , who is @entity2 's deputy chief of staff and who the president dispatched to assess the situation at the troubled agency			0
" it is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at @entity7 , " the reports reads			0
" the department must take swift and appropriate accountability actions , " the report said			0
" there must be a recognition of how true accountability works			0
" ' corrosive culture , ' weak leadership cripple @entity7 , report says			0
