@entity1 's new film -- one of the last he completed -- was going to start a new chapter for the " @entity5 " actor , says its director			1
" he had gushed to me about the new offers he was getting from people who 'd seen his performance , " says @entity7 , the first - time director of " hours , " which opens friday			1
" his career was finally going in a direction that he was excited about for the first time in many years			2
" the dramatic film , about a @entity17 man trying to keep his newborn alive in the face of @entity21 's chaos , marked a change of pace for @entity1 after making a name for himself in the " @entity5 " series			1
@entity1 's in practically every frame , agonizing over his baby , mourning his losses , willing himself to continue as his hospital is evacuated and the city is overwhelmed by floodwaters			1
@entity1 died november 30 in a horrific auto accident while riding in a friend 's high - performance sports car			1
his death has inspired shock and sadness as " @entity5 " colleagues remembered his spirit and fans paid tribute to his charity and generosity			2
video : fans honor @entity1 @entity7 , too , was left in shock by @entity1 's death			1
the news reached him over the @entity51 holiday , which he was spending in @entity52 with family			2
he remembers a " kind and patient " video - game fanatic who never pulled rank , even though he was the film 's only name performer and one of its producers			1
" he was just eager to do a great job , and that kind of inspired everybody else to step up their game and make sure they were committing the same way @entity70 was , " @entity7 says			1
the " hours " writer and director , his voice frequently quivering with emotion during a 20 - minute phone interview , talked with @entity76 about working with @entity1 and the making of the film			1
the interview has been edited and condensed : @entity76 : where did the movie idea come from ? @entity7 : it started with ( a ) short story born out of my time in @entity85			1
i knew plenty of people in @entity17 and @entity88 , many of whom who had to evacuate and who were refugees at the @entity92 in @entity85			2
some of my friends told me specific little horror stories about that time			0
and a friend told me about the fears he had as a father -- he was about to have a child -- and the story of ( " hours " protagonist ) @entity101 and his daughter attached to all those personal anecdotes of @entity21 and turned into the story			1
@entity76 : how did @entity1 get involved ? @entity7 : he did n't get involved until we signed him on to play the lead , and that was after about nine months of searching for the right leading man			1
i knew after about 20 minutes into the meeting that he was the guy			0
he had a very personal connection to the character , and he felt he had something to prove -- if to no one else other than himself -- that he could work new muscles with this role			0
@entity76 : @entity1 is in almost every frame			1
how did he deal with that ? @entity7 : it was a great risk doing this kind of movie for both of us , and it required an incredible amount of trust			1
two months before , i flew down to @entity17 ( to ) prep ; he and i agreed to meet two or three times a week and spend a few hours out of the day getting to know each other better			1
sometimes we 'd play video games or card games			0
sometimes we 'd get a bite to eat			0
it was just a case of getting used to each other 's company and our back stories			1
@entity76 : did you tap into his relationship with his daughter , meadow ? @entity7 : yes , to the point i 'd asked him to bring baby pictures of @entity145			1
during some of the scenes where there was just a monologue by him to give to the baby in the incubator , we set the baby photos in the incubator so he could connect with his daughter that way			1
it also meant a lot to him that his father was proud of him , and i knew those were sort of magic words i could tell him during a shoot			2
those words of " your father will be proud of you for this moment , for this scene " really elicited an emotional response from him , and i could tell it was because he 'd always had that in the back of his mind			2
@entity76 : how was he to direct ? @entity7 : he was a real honest performer in that there was n't much of a difference between the character of @entity101 and the person that @entity70 is in real life			0
i found that the more that i could shorten the distance between those two , the greater performance i got out of him			0
@entity70 was a very unique			0
... he 's a unique creature in that he was so kind and patient with everyone			1
he was the best kind of actor you could have in these circumstances			1
he never got impatient with anyone			0
he knew all the names of my crew , and he worked to make sure that his part and his performance helped everybody else			0
@entity76 : did he feel a weight on his shoulders ? @entity7 : he never seemed to balk at that during the shoot			0
he confessed to me later that it did scare him many a night			0
he 'd go home and worry that he was n't doing enough			0
@entity76 : when was the last time you spoke to him ? @entity7 : about a week before the death			0
we had had a press junket for the movie going into that weekend			2
@entity76 : how do you feel ? @entity7 : ( he lets out a long sigh and speaks slowly			0
) well , @entity211 , the truth of it is , i 'm angry			0
and i 've been angry about this for a while			0
this movie was a real turning point for @entity70			2
he had gushed to me about the new offers he was getting from people who 'd seen his performance in " hours , " and his career was finally going in a direction that he was excited about for the first time in many years			2
i told him at the time that that 's what this movie was , that i was just warming him up for bigger and better things			1
( he sighs again ) so the fact that this is his swan song , it , i do n't know -- it makes me mad			0
he does n't get to benefit from all this hard work now			0
@entity76 : it 's a loss			2
@entity76 : it must be very trying to do this without him			0
( laughs in relief ) but at the same time , i know he was so excited for people to see the movie , and i feel like if i shut that down and i do n't make my best effort to help people to see him , then i 'm kind of letting him down , and i ca n't stand that			1
i 'm still very proud of the movie and proud of him and excited to have everybody see it , of course			2
so i can revel in that , and the rest of the time i have to steel my nerves and keep a tissue box handy			0
people we lost in 2013			0
