" you ! you have moto , yes ? " an elderly woman , her craggy face peering out from the folds of her voluminous black chador , demands my attention			0
i 'm in the immigration line at the @entity13 - @entity12 border and my heart is pounding as i wait to be stamped into the @entity15			1
i nod warily , confirming that yes , that is me -- a solo female with a @entity18 passport and a motorcycle			1
i adjust my headscarf , fearing that my interrogator is a member of @entity12 's infamous " morality police , " the hardliners instructed to arrest women for " immodest " behavior			1
she jabs me in the chest			0
" you come with moto ? " she asks again , twisting an imaginary throttle and even adding a few " vroom vroom " sound effects			0
i 'm still not sure if i 'm in trouble but her opinion becomes clear when she grabs my face and gives it an enthusiastic slap , before pulling me in for a rib - crushing hug			0
" very good ! very good ! " she shouts while i gasp for breath among the folds of her chador			0
" i am wishing you all the luck in the world ! " finding the ' real ' @entity12 this enthusiastic welcome sets the scene for my entire journey -- motorcycling 3,000 miles around @entity12 solo and female , from the rugged northwest of the country to the @entity53 and over the remote @entity54 to the fume - choked streets of @entity56			1
my motivation ? curiosity about the huge gulf between how @entity12 is perceived in the @entity60 and what i hear about it from the few people i know who have been there			1
often painted in the media as a terrifying place full of extremists , travelers who return from @entity12 invariably rave about how wonderful and welcoming they found the @entity12 people			1
i wanted to discover the place for myself			0
following some wild times in the capital , where it turns out you can get everything from contraband bacon to booze , i continue through the peaceful @entity77 to the ancient cities of @entity79 , @entity80 and the deserts of the south			0
reports of tourists being arrested for espionage are in the front of my mind when , at one border post , i 'm frogmarched to the police station to be fingerprinted			0
but , of course , a people and its government are two separate entities			2
@entity96 hospitality is legendary and i find myself overwhelmed with generosity and kindness from @entity12 keen to distance themselves from the negative image of their homeland -- from truckers stuffing pomegranates into my panniers to complete strangers insisting on paying for my hotel room and an endless stream of tea			1
challenging too of course , there are a couple of challenging moments , most often involving the police			0
there are different kinds of police in @entity12 and on one occasion in @entity56 a car full of plainclothes revolutionary guards deliberately drives into me			1
on another occasion i 'm assaulted at a remote desert gas station by a pump attendant who is probably on meth ( quite common in the rural areas , i 'm told )			0
shouting , he lunges at me			0
luckily i 'm still sitting on the bike , and after a kick in the right place i ride off as fast as possible			0
but then i 'm out in the desert with very little fuel ... a pretty scary scenario , too			0
in fact , the very act of riding a motorcycle can be daunting in @entity12 as the driving can be insane			1
@entity12 reportedly has the highest rate of road deaths and traffic related accidents in the world , so every morning i feel like i 'm going into battle			1
but the welcome from the people makes up for it manifold			2
curious and curiouser i 'm also a source of intense curiosity myself , especially as @entity12 women are forbidden from riding motorcycles in public			1
foreign travelers are rare in @entity12 and the sight of a @entity18 - registered motorcycle caused much excitement among drivers who would pass me with an inch to spare , blasting their horns while hanging out the window and filming me on their phones			1
as i travel around i 'm passed from stranger to stranger , who quickly become friends , and as a result , find myself mingling with a range of @entity12 society			1
my hosts range from underground filmmakers and the designer - clad elite of @entity56 to a rebel - rousing schoolgirl and @entity12 's celebrated explorer , @entity172 , who motorcycled around the world in the 1950s			1
@entity12 remain warm and fun - loving people			1
some areas off limits @entity178 is n't an entirely free affair though -- travelers must take care not to stray into military areas or near nuclear plants and taking pictures of military or official buildings is a no - no. for my project , i 'd snap them quickly and then be on my way , reminded that the authoritarian streak is never far away			2
vast murals of the @entity191 ( ayatollah @entity192 ) loom over every street corner and everyone i meet has a story of police intimidation , arrests and the oppressive reality of life under the regime			2
in the desert city of @entity202 i 'm invited to stay with an ex-army general and his family			1
he fought in the @entity206 of the 1980s and lost his legs in the conflict			2
i 'm wary of this invitation , wondering what i 'll have in common with an @entity12 veteran , but my concerns are unfounded			2
he 's far from the grizzled war - monger i fear and within moments of meeting he 's cracking jokes and teaching me @entity96 slang			0
the highlight of the trip comes , unexpectedly , as we take the elevator in his apartment block to go out for dinner			0
i 'm learning the @entity96 numbers as we descend each floor and as we count " three , two , one " he announces in @entity227 , " it 's the final countdown ! " we do n't have to say anything			0
the two of us look at each other , laugh and burst into song			2
" @entity234 , @entity233 daa ! " this is the moment i know i 'd been right to ignore the naysayers and to come and seek out the real @entity12			2
neither @entity237 nor @entity60 @entity12 has always prided itself on being " neither @entity237 nor @entity60			2
" geographically it stands between the two cultures , never aligning itself with either , making for the strong sense of @entity96 identity			0
sadly , the popular image of @entity12 today , fueled by the rhetoric of politicians means that the @entity12 people are lumped in with @entity246 extremists and terrorism			1
this could n't be further from the truth			0
my travels unveiled a nation of sophisticated , kindhearted people eager to engage with the wider world			1
if only their government would follow their example .			0

@entity18 travel writer @entity258 motorcycled 3,000 miles through @entity12 on her own
her travels revealed a nation divided between an authoritarian regime and a friendly , welcoming people
breaking into 1980s song " @entity265 " with an ex-army general was one of her highlights
