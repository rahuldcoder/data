-- on wednesday i had the privilege of meeting with @entity3 , a member of the @entity4			0
when he entered the room , @entity3 walked up excitedly to examine a framed document that has hung for years in my offices			0
the document is a list of commitments to the people , signed by dozens of candidates for public office who promised to vote on a specific policy agenda if they were elected to office			1
it 's framed alongside a picture of the candidates who signed and campaigned on it			0
many of them went on to be elected in a historic vote that tossed out a party that had held power since the 1920s			0
@entity3 was looking at a framed copy of the 1996 " contract with the @entity29			0
" that contract was , as the @entity31 reported the next year , " the most widely distributed document in @entity34 history			1
" the @entity34 voters -- with a 91 % turnout -- elected the democratic opposition , which four years earlier had held just six seats			1
with a program of " private property rights , a free press and the encouragement of foreign investment , " they defeated the @entity44 that had ruled since 1921			0
@entity3 , who was elected to @entity4 as an @entity45 in 2012 and is already one of his country 's most popular politicians , recounted emotionally how the contract with the voter was a watershed event in modern @entity34 history			1
the ideas in that document , he told me , " gave us our freedom			0
" @entity34 's peaceful , democratic transition of power from the communists to a republican government was one of the few hopeful stories to come out of the former @entity64 states in the early years after the @entity65			1
it was fitting , but only a coincidence , that @entity3 visited just a few days before the 20th anniversary of the contract with @entity70 , the inspiration for @entity34 's contract with the @entity73			1
on september 27 , 1994 , more than 350 candidates for @entity75 gathered on the steps of the @entity77 to sign a pledge to the @entity70 people , a promise to vote on 10 key reforms if we won a majority in the @entity84			1
that campaign , which i helped organize , earned @entity87 control of the @entity84 for the first time in 40 years			1
the contract was a campaign document			0
it laid out a common - sense program that was designed to earn the support of the broadest possible range of @entity70			2
its assortment of policies included everything from changes to how the @entity84 did business to items on the budget , welfare and tax policy			2
but more than any particular proposal , the important thing about the document was its form : it was a contract , a real commitment to reform and accountability and renewal			2
it sought above all to " restore the bonds of trust between the people and their elected representatives			0
" we knew @entity70 deserved a clear and unambiguous account of what we planned to do , and believed reform required their explicit support -- and that if we broke faith with them , we would n't deserve to hold power			2
so we invited people to vote us out again if we did n't follow through			0
but we did follow through -- in an extraordinary first hundred days that kicked off one of the most productive congresses in @entity70 history			2
in addition to being a campaign document , the @entity89 was a management document that told us how we would govern			2
it led directly or indirectly to all of the achievements that would soon follow , including four straight balanced budgets , welfare reform , and the largest capital gains tax cut in @entity70 history			2
in retrospect , it 's clear that the @entity89 also marked an enduring political realignment			1
when the @entity87 @entity84 majority was sworn in in 1995 , there was only one @entity87 in the @entity84 ( @entity141 from @entity142 ) who had ever served under a majority -- and he had done so as a page			1
two years later , we became the first @entity87 majority that had been reelected since 1928			1
and since the contract , republicans have held the @entity84 for 16 of the past 20 years , and should continue to hold it for the foreseeable future			1
as a detailed commitment to passing specific bills , the @entity89 was the first document of its kind in @entity70 history			1
it has now been replicated in other countries , like @entity155 and @entity34 , not because of its policy content , but because it expressed a hope in the heart of every voter -- an aspiration that , in the case of the @entity77 -- did n't end with the election of 1994 and certainly did not begin there			0
the contract was , quite literally , a renewal of a pre-existing commitment , one that had not been honored			0
it was the commitment that elected representatives of the people remain accountable to the people			0
this social contract is essential to self - government , but too often , our leaders abandon it once they join the political class			1
they forget about who put them there , they contrive to shield themselves from " tough votes , " and they stretch further the restraints on their powers under the law			0
there 's nothing like a visit by a legislator from a place where , for the better part of the last century , lawlessness reigned , to remind you that the contract between the people and their representatives must be constantly renewed and ardently defended .			0

@entity198 says @entity34 was *influenced* by contract with @entity70
he says @entity87 signed @entity89 20 years *ago* ; it helped @entity87 win the @entity84
he says it was detailed commitment to passing specific bills , guided @entity87 in governing
@entity208 : too many leaders abandon ideals of @entity89 once they join the political class
