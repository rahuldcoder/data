the wait is finally over for aviation fanatics wanting to book a flight aboard the @entity4			1
@entity5 , the global launch customer of the @entity4 , accepted delivery of the commercial plane during a ceremony at @entity4 ' headquarters in @entity11 , @entity12 , on monday morning			1
" it is more than a great day for @entity4 , " the manufacturer 's ceo , @entity13 , told a press conference			2
" i would say it was an historic day			0
" the " xwb " in the name means " extra wide body			0
" there are three different iterations of the plane being built : the @entity4 , the @entity27 and the @entity28 , which seat 270 , 314 and 350 passengers , respectively , in three - class seating			1
@entity5 opted for a two - class , 283 - seat configuration in its @entity30 , offering 36 business class seats and 247 in economy class			1
in total , the airline has ordered 80 of the airplanes -- 43 a350 - 900 jetliners and 37 of the longer - fuselage -1000 versions			0
in a statement , the airline said it expects to induct the first eight production aircraft into its fleet before 2015 year - end			2
@entity5 ' new @entity30 will enter into commercial service in january , operating daily flights between its @entity46 hub in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , @entity50			1
minor turbulence delays delivery monday 's @entity4 delivery ceremony was originally supposed to take place on december 12 , but the airline canceled the event just a few days beforehand			1
neither side initially offered an explanation , leaving aviation analysts to speculate on what was behind the hold up			0
@entity5 ceo @entity61 told monday 's press conference that the delay was related to one of its suppliers and was not an issue with @entity4			1
" it 's important to note that the aircraft has been delivered to us one week ahead of schedule , not late , " he said			0
delays are nothing new for @entity5 , which also postponed the delivery of three of its @entity76 superjumbos this year after @entity61 reportedly expressed concerns about the quality of the interior			2
@entity4 chief @entity13 described @entity61 as a " tough customer ... you are demanding , sometimes for us a bit too demanding			2
" he said @entity48 's exacting standards had raised the quality of the final product and would make it easier to sell to other carriers			0
@entity13 also used monday 's event to try to draw a line under recent reports that it might pull the plug on @entity76 production after a fall off in orders			2
he said such speculation was " just crazy ... after all the efforts we have made			0
" " i can tell you the @entity76 will have a brighter future as the market gets bigger			0
" the @entity4 's road to flight the @entity4 is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes @entity4 designed to go head - to - head with rival @entity109 's @entity108 and 777s			1
the project for the new jet began in 2006 and was initially criticized by some in the industry , including airlines , for not really advancing the global aviation scene			0
being publicly lambasted by some of its largest customers -- one aviation executive called it a @entity122 reaction to the @entity108 , while the ceo of @entity124 said the plane just did n't go far enough -- the pressure was on for @entity4 to come up with a game changing plane			1
much of the aircraft we see today is the result of that pressure			0
made from advanced materials , 53 % of the @entity4 frame consists of carbon - fiber reinforced polymer , including @entity4 ' first carbon - fiber fuselage			2
as a result , @entity4 says the plane will burn 25 % less fuel than existing similar size jets			2
the @entity4 is powered by two massive @entity143 engines , though those who have experienced its test flights say it 's remarkable just how quiet the plane actually is			1
@entity4 says passengers will also get a higher quality of air ( replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes ) , wider cabins and 18 - inch - wide seats in economy			0
as of the end of november , @entity4 has received 778 firm @entity4 orders from 41 airlines			1
to meet this demand , @entity4 says it 's ramping up production progressively to reach the planned rate of 10 aircraft per month by 2018			0
the 2014 list prices for the aircraft are : $ 260.9 million for the @entity4 , $ 295.2 million for the @entity30 and $ 340.7 million for the @entity28			1
how to spot an @entity4 ? with the first of nearly 800 @entity168 set to hit the skies , plane spotters will be particularly keen to see the sporty new jet in flight			0
so how will you know when you 're looking at one ? key distinguishing features include a streamlined nose and wrap - around cockpit windows			0
also , located just ahead of the windshield are the jetliner 's nose - mounted pitot tubes , which measure speed , lateral drift and angle of attack during flight , says @entity4			1
but perhaps the most noticeable feature is the plane 's tapered wings , which @entity4 says makes the plane faster , more efficient and quieter			1
these include winglet - type devices -- " sharklets " -- that reduce aerodynamic drag .			0
