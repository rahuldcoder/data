-- something i love about @entity4 politics : a political candidacy can be sunk by a fishing license			1
@entity8 's run for the @entity11 @entity10 nomination from @entity12 suffered a setback after it was discovered that she bought a $ 24 fishing license last year without having lived in the state for a year			1
with surreal seriousness , a spokesman for the @entity17 and @entity18 said of the scandal , " we have an ongoing investigation			0
the law is extremely complicated			0
" a @entity11 strategist living in @entity12 added , " it 's a serious misstep			1
allegedly poaching in a state where being a resident sportsman is , by law , an earned privilege			0
@entity12 people will take this very seriously			1
" will they really ? the primary election between challenger @entity33 and the popular incumbent , sen. @entity35 , is a whole year away , and i struggle to believe that it 'll be lost for want of a fishing license			1
but it is a sign of trouble ahead for @entity33			0
polls show that she 's perceived to be an outsider -- and she 's starting to learn that you can make a big name for yourself in national conservative politics but still fail to get traction at a state level			1
@entity33 's only real , substantive link to @entity12 is through her father , @entity52 , who served for 10 years as a congressman			1
otherwise , she was born in @entity56 , lived much of her life in the @entity59 area , went to college in @entity61 and @entity62 and made her name working for the @entity65 administration			0
not a lot of @entity12 in that cv at all			1
instead , her credentials to represent the state are partly political rather than local			2
@entity33 is a talented administrator and activist -- a strong public speaker who can bring a tea party crowd to its feet			0
the level of respect that she 's engendered speaks to her abilities , but also her links to the national , rather than @entity12 , political establishment			1
when the @entity83 wrote a friendly profile of @entity33 , the @entity85 ( significantly , a scrappy conservative website ) took the big names quoted in support of her and showed up their hyperbole			0
" she was tea party before there was a tea party , " said @entity91 ( that was clever )			0
" she is not just her father 's daughter , " said @entity96 ( what else could she be ? ! )			2
" i was excited about @entity101 ; i 'm more excited about @entity8 , " said @entity102 ( big shoes to fill )			1
the most absurd remark came from @entity91 : " [ @entity33 ] really is a cowgirl through and through , and raised by accident in @entity59			0
babies do n't move wherever they want ; they have to go with their parents			0
" now , @entity91 ought to know that cowgirls are raised , not made , and babies rarely show a preference for one state over another			0
although the image of baby @entity8 in a ten gallon hat crying for @entity12 is a beguiling one			1
so @entity33 has arrived in @entity12 with a lot of national conservative sentiment behind her but precious little local backing			1
that 's reflected in her campaign , which has had a lot more to say about undoing the @entity125 administration than standing up for her state			2
her basic argument is that a ) @entity11 incumbent @entity35 is too nice to @entity125 and @entity129 ) " obstructionism " is " patriotism			1
" perhaps there 's some local right - wing sentiment that agrees @entity35 has been bipartisan once too often , but @entity33 is mistaken if she thinks that her state will vote for someone who pitches herself purely as a " senator no. " that sort of thing gets a big applause at meetings of the @entity141 , but it might it might not be so attractive to @entity12 voters looking for someone to bring home the bacon			1
and do we really want yet another senator who refuses to do business with anyone ? it 's not as if @entity150 is unpopular because it 's too compromising			2
finally , there 's the problem of @entity33 being an all - round anachronism in this age of tea party populism			1
yes , her gender and relative youth make her seem like fresh leadership			0
but her name is a hindrance and deserves to be			0
@entity4 needs to put its political dynasties out to graze : it 's perverse that a republic of free people should keep voting for the scions of the @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 or @entity172			2
the @entity4 is starting to look less like a democracy and more like an aristocracy			0
furthermore , @entity33 's politics are a little old - fashioned , too			2
she might be on the zeitgeist by being for same - sex marriage , but her neoconservative stance on foreign policy is about 10 years out of date			0
the next generation of @entity11 leadership is going to be populist , small state , critical of getting overinvolved overseas , civil libertarian and intensely loyal to its birthplace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : running for @entity10 , @entity8 misstepped over fishing license
he says in her challenge to sen. @entity35 , many see her as outsider to @entity12
he says her connection is mostly through dad ; she 's national figure , not local
@entity191 : her no - compromise conservatism a tough sell
