@entity0 , 29 , has lived in @entity1 for five years , where she works as freelance writer and film maker			1
her blog , @entity5 , keeps tabs on the city 's nightlife and restaurants , and she is also the editor of the @entity1 edition of @entity11			1
@entity0 has lived in @entity1 for five years and says the city has a vibrant arts scene			1
@entity14 : what made you start blogging the city ? @entity0 : when i moved down here i realized there was so much more to the city than just the beach and the hotels			1
there were lots of extravagant condo - building parties at the time -- the type where you 'd go to the construction site , because the building was still in the planning stages , and they 'd throw this lavish catered party with open bar and feather dancers in an effort to get people to buy units			0
we were going to at least three of these events a week and i felt the need to document it			0
so my blog started out as kind of a nightlife , event - driven blog and eventually became a chronicle of my adventures in the city , focused now mostly on my eating adventures			2
@entity14 : what makes @entity1 so special to you ? @entity0 : i think @entity1 is a place of unbridled optimism			1
it 's also a place of great opportunity			1
there 's lots of room here for entrepreneurial spirit and it 's very much encouraged and appreciated			0
just look at how much the city has changed in five years , in terms of the revival of @entity65 and the @entity66 , and the thriving art scene			2
it 's a place that is still evolving identity-wise and i 'm excited to be a part of it			2
@entity14 : is there anything you dislike about the city ? @entity0 : the seasonal aspect of the city can be frustrating -- the way it shuts down in the summer and then revs up in the winter			1
also , the crowding in the winter , when all the seasonal residents come back and suddenly there are no parking spaces , the lines at the grocery store are horrendous and you realize you 're trying to live in a tourist @entity89 and get your errands done when everyone around you is vacationing			0
oh and the drivers -- possibly the worst driving etiquette in the country			0
@entity14 : is @entity1 just about the sun and sand , or is there more to it ? @entity0 : there 's definitely more to this city than the tropical getaway			1
there 's a vibrant art scene , where each month the gallery district is alive with opening receptions and throngs of people interested in getting out and seeing the scene			1
there 's also the internationally renowned @entity110 art fair that comes to town every year putting @entity1 on the cultural map			1
also , food-wise there 's lots of exciting things going on , from an incredibly diverse selection of @entity118 cuisine			1
everything from @entity120 to @entity122 food , to @entity123 , to @entity124 -- there 's a ton of great ethnic food here			2
there 's also a growing high - end dining scene , where a lot of the national trends , like organic , locally sourced cooking , are happening on a very high level			0
@entity14 : could you describe a typical @entity136 's weekend ? @entity0 : a typical weekend would probably entail going to dinner in the @entity66 on friday night , going for a walk or a bike ride along the beach on saturday morning , then lunch on @entity142			2
saturday night there are usually some great djs in town , so it 's worth checking out the @entity65 club scene , or if it 's @entity149 , the galleries in @entity151			2
sunday is spent perusing farmers markets , which are popping up in most neighborhoods , and lazily reading the paper over brunch			0
sunday night is always bingo at the @entity158 hotel , a hipster hangout			0
@entity14 : where do you shop ? @entity0 : i usually head to the @entity163 if i 'm looking to hit a bunch of stores in one fix			0
there 's @entity168 , @entity169 and your typical mall stores , like @entity171 , etc. @entity172 in @entity173 between 10th and 6th is good for @entity174 ( where there 's always a sale ) , @entity177 and the @entity178			0
@entity14 : if @entity1 was a person , what would she or he be like ? @entity0 : attractive , laid back and stylish			1
loves the beach and the sun but is also involved in a personal creative pursuit -- business , fashion , art or nightlife			0
