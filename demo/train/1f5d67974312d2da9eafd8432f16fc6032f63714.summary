as world powers are gathering in @entity3 this week for a final round of nuclear talks with @entity6 , @entity1 diplomats put their chances of a comprehensive deal at 50 percent at best and a breakthrough before the nov. 24 deadline appears highly unlikely			1
while an accord might not be met by next monday 's deadline , diplomats say it is possible to agree on the outline of a deal			1
they say an extension of the talks to resolve the remaining issues and work out the details is the most likely scenario			0
though nobody is talking publicly yet about the prospects for an extension , one senior administration official said a continuation of the talks was far preferable to a total collapse of the process			0
" we are striving for a final deal , but if that does n't happen , do we walk away and throw away all of the progress that has been made over these nine months , " the official asked rhetorically			2
" we just ca n't do that			0
" the parties have been tight - lipped about the details of the negotiations , most of which are highly technical			0
while diplomatic sources say progress has been made on all issues , the main sticking points continue to center around @entity6 's uranium enrichment capacity and the pace at which decades long sanctions against @entity47 would be lifted in exchange for intrusive inspections and curbs on its program			1
a deal would help end decades of mutual mistrust between @entity6 and the @entity57 , paving the way for better relations and potential cooperation			1
but failure could lead to an unwanted military confrontation in a region already wracked by violence , instability and political chaos			0
negotiations are aimed at reconfiguring @entity6 's nuclear program in an effort to extend the time @entity6 would have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon , otherwise known as the " breakout time			1
" experts say at present it could take @entity6 as little as three months			2
the six world powers want to extend that to at least a year , giving the international community time to intervene			0
as the number of outstanding issues has dwindled , the differences over the remaining ones have grown sharper			0
diplomats caution nothing is truly agreed to until everything is hammered out -- comparing the negotiations to a complex " @entity86 " - like puzzle			0
take @entity6 's enrichment program			1
a key component of extending @entity6 's breakout time centers around limiting the amount of enriched uranium @entity6 is able to produce and keep on hand			2
the @entity94 and its allies have demanded major cuts in the amount of centrifuges @entity6 can keep to enrich uranium			1
at the onset of negotiations , @entity6 demanded to keep all 19,000 of its centrifuges , while the @entity94 and its allies wanted to cut the number to as low as 1,500			1
now diplomats say the six world powers are prepared to accept around 4,500 centrifuges			0
that 's still far from the roughly 8 to 10,000 @entity6 seems prepared to accept			0
but that magic number of centrifuges is also dependent on an agreement by @entity6 to reduce its stockpile of already - enriched uranium			1
diplomats say @entity6 has indicated a willingness to ship much of its estimated 28,000 pounds of enriched uranium to @entity113 , where it would be converted into nuclear fuel for civilian usage			1
this would also help to extend @entity6 's breakout time and could unlock the stalemate over how many centrifuges @entity6 can keep			1
another goal is to prevent @entity6 from acquiring enough plutonium to give it a second route a nuclear bomb through its heavy water reactor at @entity125			1
the reactor was under construction , but work stopped in this past january under the interim deal reached between @entity6 and the six world powers			1
if fully operational , the reactor could reprocess fuel into plutonium			0
diplomats say proposals have been introduced to " modify " the plant to prevent plutonium from ever being produced			0
one option under discussion involves converting the plant into a light water reactor which could be used for civilian purposes			0
adding to doubts about a final deal are charges by the @entity145 's nuclear watchdog that @entity6 has not handed over past research on the military dimension of its nuclear program			1
world powers want the @entity150 to conclusively rule on whether @entity6 has worked on designing an atomic bomb			0
@entity6 denies the charges , saying its nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes			1
but a recent @entity150 report , obtained by @entity154 , said that @entity6 has failed to address the suspicions by explaining its activity on high explosives testing and other nuclear activity			1
despite a pledge in may to @entity6 come clean with the @entity150 about the activity , the report said @entity6 " has not provided any explanations that enable the agency to clarify " the outstanding questions			0
@entity6 has demanded an immediate lifting of all sanctions once a deal is struck , while @entity94 and @entity168 diplomats want a gradual lifting of sanctions once @entity6 demonstrates it is adhering to its end of the deal			1
the duration of the deal is also in dispute -- @entity6 wants a settlement of all issues after five years , but world powers are calling for at least ten			2
a senior @entity94 administration official briefing reporters ahead of the talks predicted that neither @entity6 's supreme leader nor the six world powers would reveal their actual bottom line until the eleventh hour			1
" we are at a very , very difficult point in this negotiation , " she said			0
" we all knew that tough decisions -- the toughest decisions -- would not be taken ' til the end , and that is likely to be the case , if they can be taken at all			0
" while an accord might not be within reach by next monday 's deadline , diplomats say it is possible to agree on an outline			2
president @entity198 and @entity6 president @entity199 face domestic political pressure to strike a deal			1
an extension could sharpen opposition both in the @entity94 and in @entity6			1
@entity204 take control of the @entity206 in january and lawmakers have threatened fresh sanctions on @entity6 if a deal is not reached			2
although @entity198 has the power to veto , just the prospect of additional sanctions could drive @entity6 away from the table			0
@entity199 and foreign minister @entity214 , the lead @entity6 negotiator , are under fire from conservatives and lawmakers who were skeptical of the interim deal and have said a final agreement must be ratified by parliament			2
earlier this month 200 @entity6 members of parliament signed a statement demanding that @entity6 negotiators " vigorously defend " the country 's nuclear rights and ensure a " total lifting of sanctions "			2
as the clock ticks down , western diplomats say a deal will hinge on an @entity6 political decision that needs to happen this week			1
" we do n't think any side wants to walk away , " one @entity1 diplomat said			0
" but we need to make the @entity6 understand that , yes , we want a deal and we are prepared to work hard at getting one , but not at any cost			2
there are red lines we ca n't cross , and if there is n't enough progress by next week , what will change ? " @entity6 , too , is making clear it has red lines			2
arriving in @entity3 for the talks , @entity214 said a deal hinged on the political will of the @entity57 , making clear @entity6 would " be resisting excessive demands " in the final negotiating sessions			1
" we are here to find a solution that respects the @entity6 nation 's rights and removes the legitimate concerns of the international community , " he said			0
despite the posturing on both sides , diplomats did not rule out the potential for a surprise eleventh hour deal , just as negotiators announced an interim deal to continue negotiations in the final hours of talks last year			2
" @entity266 rabbits got pulled of small hats last time , " one @entity1 diplomat said			0
" i would never say never			0

talks between @entity1 diplomats and @entity6 regarding its nuclear program are showing progress
the talks have a deadline for a deal of monday that appears unlikely to be met
one issue remains is how many centrifuges is @entity6 allowed to keep
both the @entity94 and @entity6 are facing political *headwinds* from home
