-- there 's a reason why @entity4 officials are so confident it was @entity5 that sent signals to a satellite many hours after the plane disappeared from radar march 8			1
that 's because @entity0 has learned signals from commercial aircraft to @entity13 satellites always include a code confirming the identity of the plane			1
an @entity13 official , while declining to discuss specifics of flight 370 , tells @entity0 the satellite system is highly reliable , that each signal to an aircraft is met by a return signal and that those signals always contains a code verifying the identity of the aircraft			1
it is " virtually impossible " to change an aircraft 's identifying code or to confuse one aircraft with another , the @entity13 official said			1
further , after a satellite link is established at the beginning of a plane 's flight , it makes automatic , periodic checks until the end of the flight -- helping investigators determine the duration of the flight , if not its location			1
that could explain why @entity4 authorities now say they have a " high degree of confidence " that @entity5 continued flying well after it disappeared from civilian radar screens			1
map it : what happened to flight 370 ? government officials now believe the plane continued flying until at least 8:11 a.m. -- almost seven hours after disappearing from radar at 1:21 a.m. @entity4 officials , citing " satellite information " but giving scant details , this weekend refocused the search for the missing @entity58 , moving attention to massive arcs on both sides of the equator			1
@entity4 authorities believe someone disabled several communications systems , perhaps to conceal the plane 's location			1
one of those systems was a digital data system known as @entity69 , which uses the satellite to relay messages to the ground			0
but while it is possible for someone in the cockpit to turn off @entity69 , the system 's powered antenna remained on , receiving and responding to hourly checks from a ground station , via the satellite			2
@entity13 technicians continue to help , the company said			1
" our experts have been pulled into the investigation			0
we 've had people in @entity86 , " said @entity13 subject expert @entity84			2
" we are putting everything into this to assist the investigation as best we can , because it seems there 's no other data set			0
" how @entity13 works @entity13 , which is prohibited from discussing details of the @entity5 investigation , was able to provide @entity0 with a detailed explanation about how its system works			1
the @entity96 - based satellite communications company owns and operates 10 satellites , all in geostationary orbit some 22,200 miles above the equator			1
since a single satellite can see one - third of the @entity103 , multiple satellites are needed to provide seamless coverage and provide redundancy and reliability , the company said			1
among other services , @entity13 provides satellite communications for the @entity69 , the acronym for @entity110 and @entity111			1
it 's a digital datalink for short messages between an aircraft and an airline operations center , air traffic controllers and others			2
@entity69 can be used to send messages and data of all types , including text messages from pilots to dispatchers , or automatically generated data on the health of the plane			0
when a plane is over land , @entity69 messages typically are sent via vhf radio			0
but when a plane is in remote regions , or over water and out of range of @entity130 , the signal is seamlessly switched to satellite			2
" the pilot does n't have to do anything , " @entity84 said			0
at its most fundamental , the satellite is a simple relay , transferring signals from ground stations to the aircraft , and back again , not unlike a cell phone tower , @entity84 said			1
' handshakes ' help determine location when an aircraft powers up , the airplane automatically sends a signal logging onto the communications network			2
thereafter , the ground station sends " polling signals " to the satellite , which relays them to the aircraft			1
when the aircraft responds , it is known as a " handshake			0
" the information relayed during the handshake is very limited , but it contains a unique identifying code to identify the aircraft			1
the purpose of the hourly " handshakes " is to allow the satellite to know the approximate location of the aircraft so that it can efficiently relay any messages			2
for this , the satellite needs to know the angle of the aircraft from the satellite			2
an aircraft directly under the satellite would be at a 90 degree angle to the satellite ; an aircraft at the poles would be at 0 degrees			2
in the case of @entity176 370 , authorities have said , the last message sent was at 40 degrees			0
accident investigators , with the help of satellite experts , have used that information to determine the possible location of the plane			0
" we 're trying to get up to speed on what that means and how to interpret it , " one @entity185 official told reporters			0
" it 's sort of a new technology for us			0
" " we have never had to use satellite handshaking as the best possible source of information , " the official said			0
a completed handshake also suggests the plane was operational because the plane needs electrical power to send the return signal			0
a plane 's return signal is an acknowledgment that , " yes , i 'm still here , " @entity84 said			0
in the case of flight 370 , the " last successful handshake occurred somewhere along that circle , " the @entity185 official said			0
" a lot of that semicircle is over land ; a lot of it is over water , " he said			0
" we are trying to figure out how we can use that information to give us an idea of what the last known location of the airplane might have been			0

@entity96 - based satellite communications company @entity13 talks to @entity0
@entity225 says signals from aircraft to @entity13 satellites always include an @entity230 code
it is " virtually impossible " to change an aircraft 's identifying code , official says
this could explain why @entity4 is sure plane continued flying long after radar contact was lost
