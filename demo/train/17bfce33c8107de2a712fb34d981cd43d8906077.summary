-- here 's a glimpse , dear reader , into the private @entity4 musings of your humble correspondent			1
" i love the ship and dam signs			2
i 'm going to help out @entity9			0
" " well , i will never be			0
" " puts the competition in a @entity12 tie			0
" " ewoks are small , feral teddy bears who can paint a picture			0
" " @entity17 , the internets			0
" ok ... maybe those would be his musings if he was an opium - fueled beat poet who , apparently , thinks too much about " @entity22			0
" but they 're just the sort of status updates that are captivating millions of @entity4 users this week , thanks to a new tool dreamed up during a caffeine - enhanced hacking binge at @entity30			1
" what would i say ? " is a simple concept			0
you go to the website and give it permission to access your @entity4 profile			1
it will then suggest random new status updates for you , stitched together from random words and phrases you 've posted to @entity4 in the past			1
keep obsessively clicking " @entity44 , " and the jumble of phrases pulled from your past status updates will create existential poetry			1
" we drank a lot of coffee and @entity54 and thought of fun things we could program that we could actually complete in a day and a half , " @entity57 , part of the seven - member team that created the site , told the @entity62			2
the effort was part of a hackathon last weekend at @entity30			1
all of the team members ( apart from a @entity68 named @entity69 ) are @entity30 graduate - school students			1
" this was just for fun , " @entity57 said			0
" we never thought we would get further than showing this off at the @entity74 and to our friends on @entity4			1
" but soon , the app , which lets users post the results of their random generations straight to @entity4 , had gone viral on the social network			1
it was n't long before they were being shared on @entity83 , too			2
" all of my what - would - i - say statuses are either highly accurate , inappropriate , or make me sound like i 'm drunk and / or ca n't @entity87 , " one user wrote			2
the simple little tool is oddly fascinating			0
on top of the serendipity of mashing together words that , occasionally , form something better than the original posts , each refresh sparks a moment of nostalgia as you try to remember your original updates			2
of course , that sort of @entity101 rabbit hole has its dangers			0
" i found myself quickly tired of the ones that other people were sharing , and drawn back to my own , sure that they were funnier or contained more depth , " @entity105 wrote in the @entity62 piece			0
" narcissism and nostalgia are two of the driving forces of @entity4 's popularity , and this new app combines both quite neatly			1

@entity4 app " what would i say ? " randomly generates status updates that are like *bizarre* poetry
the app was the result of a weekend hackathon at @entity30
users can post their random results straight to @entity4
grad students who created it say they did n't expect it to *spread* so *widely*
