-- @entity2 's longtime singing competition " @entity3 " is embroiled in a lawsuit brought by 10 @entity6 former contestants who say they were unfairly dismissed from the show because of their race			1
their complaint was filed thursday in @entity10 for the @entity11 , alleging that " @entity3 " producers unlawfully acquired information about contestants ' criminal backgrounds for both black and white contestants but then used whatever they found solely against black finalists			1
if the arrest records of white " idol " finalists were made public , the suit alleges that they conversely were " championed as models of redemption			1
" the suit accuses the producers of using criminal background checks to " systematically disqualify and publicly humiliate " black " idol " finalists as a ratings ploy , perpetuating stereotypes along the way			1
it contends that while there " were three times as many @entity34 ( or non-black ) contestants featured on ' @entity3 ' " since it began in 2002 , " there has never been a single @entity34 ( or non-black ) contestant disqualified " from the series			1
@entity2 and " @entity3 " production company @entity41 have so far declined @entity0 's request for comment			1
the 10 plaintiffs include @entity45 ( season 2 ) , @entity47 ( season 2 ) , @entity48 ( season 2 ) , @entity49 ( season 3 ) , @entity50 and @entity51 ( season 5 ) , @entity52 ( season 6 ) , @entity53 ( season 6 ) , @entity54 ( season 8 ) and @entity56 ( season 9 )			1
each former contestant is seeking $ 25 million in damages for " economic injuries , lost business opportunities and / or lost earning potential " following their dismissal from " idol			1
" their attorney , @entity64 , said the exit of season 11 contestant @entity66 inspired him to take the case			2
in 2012 , @entity66 was disqualified from " idol " for allegedly concealing " multiple crimes and outstanding police warrants , " but @entity66 is n't a part of the current lawsuit			2
in an interview with @entity0 , @entity66 said he had a " really good experience " as a contestant , although he disagrees with the way he was kicked off the show			0
" i think that they handled ( the situation ) the way they wanted to handle the situation			0
do i agree with it ? of course not			0
i would love to have been on the show to be able to compete , " @entity66 said			0
" but you know i take the highs and the lows , the good and the bad			0
" when he was asked to be a part of the lawsuit , @entity66 said he declined			2
" i 'm grateful for the whole experience			0
you know , the good parts , the bad parts -- it all made me who i am , and it helped enhance and cultivate me as a person ( and ) as a musician , as an artist , as a performer			0
i 'm just moving forward			0
" during the 12 seasons of " @entity3 , " four @entity6 - @entity6 contestants have won : @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 ( who is biracial ) and @entity106			2
