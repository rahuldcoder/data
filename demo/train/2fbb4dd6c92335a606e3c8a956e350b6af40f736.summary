-- warm waters off @entity3 are to blame in the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds on the coast , government authorities say			1
the @entity7 for the @entity8 reported earlier this week that since february the @entity3 coast has had an abundance of warm water as a result of marine currents throughout the world 's oceans			1
the warm water has altered the marine ecosystem , it said			0
the warm water has led fish such as anchovy and other species that live in surface waters to migrate to deeper water toward the south			1
as a result , pelicans and other birds that feed from the surface of the water died of starvation			2
" if these oceanographic conditions persist , it is likely that its impact will spread to other areas of the ( @entity3 ) coast even during the fall , which could make the numbers increase and affect other marine species " said the report			2
the ministry of environment said seafood is still safe to eat , and encouraged everyone to continue to support local fishermen , according to state - run @entity44 news agency			1
" @entity50 resources are fully guaranteed , so we promote consumption and discard the speculation that some people or institutions disseminated irresponsibly , " said the deputy minister for strategic development of natural resources , @entity48			0

" the health alert does not prohibit admission to the beaches , but people are advised to avoid contact with the remains of pelicans , dolphins and other animals that are stranded , " he said			2
officials in @entity3 continue to search for the culprit in the death of almost 900 dolphins since the beginning of the year			0
the health ministry is awaiting final results from molecular analysis looking for the morbillivirus , which previously has been linked to dolphin deaths .			0
