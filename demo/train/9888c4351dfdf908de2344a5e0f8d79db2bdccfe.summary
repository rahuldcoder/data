-- let 's face it , if you 're on holiday in @entity5 you 'll want to be based near the beach , which , fortunately , is where the city 's most glamorous hotels are located			2
@entity9 is known for its @entity11 hotels , like @entity12 , left			1
@entity9 is known for its distinctive @entity11 hotels , mostly built in the 1920s and 30s and often painted in bright pastel colors			1
@entity9 's @entity11 originals have been protected since the 1970s , and many have since been renovated to the highest specifications			1
@entity19 is home to more than its fair share of boutique hotels			2
the @entity12 ( 1685 @entity19 , doubles from $ 400 ) dates back to the 1940s and is crowned with streamlined fins that are pure @entity11			1
it has been re-imagined by @entity26 , with a white , minimal @entity28 - designed interior that is sophisticated and hip			1
the @entity12 's @entity30 is one of the best places in town for a poolside cocktail			0
the @entity34 ( 1901 @entity19 , doubles from $ 300 ) is another @entity26 revival of a @entity11 hotel and , if anything , it 's even cooler than @entity12			2
rooms are high - tech , welcoming and often occupied by visiting celebrities			0
the attached sushi restaurant @entity42 is top notch and the stylish @entity44 , with its four bars and tropical gardens , is one of the city 's hottest nightspots			0
do you have a favorite hotel or place to stay in @entity5 ? if you 've just won the lottery , you 'll want to stay at the @entity54 ( 2001 @entity19 , doubles from $ 785 )			0
another conversion of an @entity11 hotel , albeit augmented by a 40 - storey tower , the @entity55 adds tasteful @entity60 influences			1
its cool , dark interior is a refreshingly tasteful oasis among the @entity9 excess , and is both unashamedly luxurious and frighteningly expensive			1
back in the real world , @entity65 ( 40 @entity66 , @entity67 , doubles from $ 250 ) is a little stranded in its @entity70 locale , but is great value			2
the real draw is the superb spa , with its infinity pool and open - air mud lounge			1
but this is no austere health retreat ; it 's relaxing and fun , and all the better for it			0
this is @entity5 after all ... a cheaper , quirkier option is @entity81 ( 826 @entity82 , doubles from $ 200 )			0
owned by @entity86 fashion label @entity84 , this is a colorful , kitschy place , with individually themed rooms , such as the ornate and floral ' @entity89 ' room			0
the hotel 's @entity90 has an outstanding wine list and is surprisingly good value			0
away from the beach altogether , the @entity95 ( 1200 @entity96 , doubles from $ 310 ) , over in @entity97 , is an absolute gem			1
the rooms are n't exceptional but the building is a beauty , modeled on the @entity103 bell tower in @entity104 , with ornate @entity106 - inspired touches			0
@entity107 was a big fan back in the 1920s and these days there 's a massive pool , an 18 - hole golf course and rumors of resident ghosts ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
