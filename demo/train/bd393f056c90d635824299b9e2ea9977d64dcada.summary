the @entity3 ordered nine companies to stop selling unapproved drugs marketed for pain relief			1
the @entity3 's warning letters notified the companies they may be subject to legal action if they do not stop manufacturing and distributing " prescription unapproved products " that include high - concentrate morphine sulfate oral solutions and immediate - release tablets containing morphine sulfate , hydromorphone or oxycodone			2
this action does not include oxycodone capsules			0
all of these drugs are used for pain relief and are forms of previously approved medications			2
the agency says this is not a recall , but is instead a warning to manufacturers			0
the companies have 60 days to pull these pain - relief drugs from the market			1
distributors have 90 days to stop shipping them			0
if these drugs are not off the market by those deadlines , a company could face seizure of the narcotics and legal action			0
" we estimate there are several hundred unapproved drugs out there , " said @entity45 , director of the office of compliance within the @entity3 's @entity48			1
" we will continue to take aggressive action against those firms that do not have the required @entity3 approval for their drugs			0
today 's warning letters are another demonstration of our commitment to remove illegal , unproved drugs from the market			0
" although the @entity3 does not know whether these drugs are unsafe , it has not approved them so can not certify that the products are 100 percent safe and effective			1
" consumers have a right to expect that their drugs meet the @entity3 's safety and effectiveness standards , " said dr. @entity65 , director of the @entity48			0
" doctors and patients are often unaware that not all drugs on the market are backed by @entity3 approval			1
it is a high priority for the @entity3 to remove these products from the market because they may be unsafe , ineffective , inappropriately labeled , or of poor quality			1
" the @entity3 believes @entity79 have access to plenty of legal narcotics for pain relief and removing these unapproved drugs will not create a shortage			1
consumers who may be concerned that they are taking any unapproved drug products should refer to the @entity3 's @entity89 web page , which includes a list of manufacturers of these products			2
those who find they are taking unapproved drugs should see their health care professionals for treatment options			2
