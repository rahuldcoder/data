-- a @entity2 - run detention center housing 3,000 people will move to @entity5 control under a crucial agreement signed friday that smooths the way toward a larger agreement on the @entity2 ' future role in the country			1
the agreement , which calls for the gradual transfer of power from @entity2 forces to @entity5 over six months , removes one key sticking point from negotiations over a broader agreement on the role of the @entity2 in @entity5 after foreign combat troops withdraw in 2014			1
negotiations over the wide - ranging strategic agreement have been going on for more than a year , with little progress			0
tensions between the two countries , made worse by the february burning of qurans by @entity2 troops at @entity27 , have complicated the talks			1
in november , a loya jirga , or grand assembly of @entity5 elders , endorsed the continued presence of @entity2 forces after combat operations , but only if the countries could agree on the transfer of prisoners , an end to night raids and eliminating immunity for @entity2 troops accused of committing crimes in @entity5			1
@entity2 and @entity5 officials have already begun talks on the other major issue gumming up the larger agreement : night raids by @entity2 special operations forces , according to @entity2 and @entity5 officials who jointly briefed reporters			1
" the signing of this memorandum is an important step forward in our @entity56 negotiations and very much in keeping with both the @entity59 's recommendations and the desires of president ( @entity62 ) @entity61 , " said @entity2 gen. @entity50 , commander of the @entity51			1
@entity61 has repeatedly called for the end of @entity2 oversight of detention facilities in the country			2
on friday , his spokesman , @entity67 , called the agreement " big progress			0
" " things are happening as we wanted , " @entity67 said			0
@entity2 ambassador @entity72 said the memorandum of understanding , or @entity75 , demonstrates the @entity2 ' commitment to @entity5 sovereignty and its partnership with @entity5 , despite ups and downs in the tense relationship between the two countries			1
" we have had our challenges , and there will be challenges ahead as we continue negotiations on the framework for our strategic partnership , but this mou marks an important step forward , " he said			0
the agreement calls for the @entity2 to transfer all of the approximately 3,000 @entity5 citizens currently held under @entity2 guard at the @entity94 detention facility near @entity27 to @entity5 authorities within six months			1
the first 500 detainees would be transferred within 45 days , according to the agreement			0
transferred detainees will eventually be moved to new facilities being built in @entity94 and @entity100 , but until then will be moved from the @entity2 side of @entity94 to the @entity5 side of the center			1
although detainees would be held by @entity5 , @entity2 forces would remain at @entity94 in a " technical advisory and logistical support " role , the officials who briefed reporters said			1
@entity5 commanders also would not have the authority to release detainees on their own , according to agreement			2
any request to release a prisoner would have to be agreed to by a joint committee headed by the @entity51 commander and the @entity5 defense minister , according to the agreement			2
the deal does not apply to about 50 @entity123 prisoners being held at @entity94			0
the officer currently responsible for prison protection , identified by @entity128 spokesman gen. @entity127 as gen. @entity129 , will take over the @entity94 facility , which is the successor to one demolished in 2009 after allegations of abuse			0
that facility , called the @entity135 , was the site of abusive interrogation that ended in the deaths of two detainees in 2002 , according to @entity140 , which has described abusive treatment of detainees at the facility as common			0
while the new center has not seen that level of scandal , @entity140 and other groups have continued to challenge conditions of detention at the facility , including seeking access to @entity2 courts for those held at @entity94			2
the group also complained in 2010 about allegations of abuse , including isolation , sleep deprivation and exposure to extreme temperatures , at a screening facility at @entity27			0
the @entity27 base was also the site of the recent @entity164 burnings that set off a wave of protests and violence targeting @entity169 troops			2
the @entity171 holy books had been seized from a detainee center and allegedly contained militant annotations			0
@entity2 president @entity174 apologized for the incident , saying it was inadvertent .			0

@entity2 and @entity5 reach deal to transfer detainees
the deal removes one *hurdle* to a larger deal on the @entity2 role after 2014
that 's when combat troops are *scheduled* to leave the country
the @entity2 is holding more than 3,000 detainees at the @entity27
