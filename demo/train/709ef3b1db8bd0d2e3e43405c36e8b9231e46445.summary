-- @entity1 became the eighth @entity3 state to allow same - sex marriage thursday as gov. @entity5 signed legislation he said secures the " human dignity " of all residents , including gay and lesbian couples			1
a standing - room crowd in the @entity13 cheered @entity5 as he emerged from his office to sign the legislation , flanked by @entity2 @entity17 president @entity16 and @entity19 speaker @entity18			0

six states and the @entity25 already issue same - sex marriage licenses -- @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			1
five states -- @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage			0
