the law on assisted suicide in @entity2 is n't clear , according to a paper published in the journal @entity5 on august 20			1
that 's why , the authors say , people from other countries are traveling to the state of @entity11 for the " sole purpose of committing suicide			2
" they 're called suicide tourists			0
between 2008 and 2012 , 611 " tourists " came to @entity2 for assisted suicide , according to the published analysis			1
they arrived from 31 countries around the world , though the majority were from @entity21 and the @entity22			0
" in the @entity22 , at least , ' going to @entity2 ' has become a euphemism for ( assisted suicide ) , " the study authors write			1
" six right - to - die organizations assist in approximately 600 cases of suicide per year ; some 150 - 200 of which are suicide tourists			0
" this published paper is the result of a pilot study completed for a larger project on assisted suicide in @entity2 being done by experts at the @entity35 in @entity11			1
of the 611 assisted suicides identified during the four - year study period , just over 58 % were women			2
the patients ' ages ranged from 23 to 97 , researchers found , but the average age was 69			0
close to half of the patients had a neurological disease			0
others stated they had cancer , rheumatic disease or cardiovascular disease			0
many had more than one condition			0
in all but four cases , the assisted suicides were done using sodium pentobarbital			0
a fatal dose of this drug causes the patient to slip into a deep coma , according to @entity59 , a @entity2 right - to - die organization that was involved in most of the identified @entity61 pentobarbital paralyzes the patient 's respiratory system , causing him or her to stop breathing			0
the total number of suicide tourism cases dropped from 123 in 2008 to 86 in 2009			1
but the number of cases doubled between 2009 and 2012 , to 172			0
assisted suicide laws around the globe are in flux as countries debate the pros and cons of allowing doctors to help terminally ill patients , or patients in a lot of pain , die			1
in @entity2 , the study authors write , there are no rules to regulate under which conditions someone can receive assisted suicide , though medical professional codes allow it in certain circumstances			1
in @entity21 , there is no formal legal language in the criminal code about assisted suicide , but doctors are not ethically allowed to help someone commit suicide -- and can be held criminally responsible for not helping a patient if they witness him or her going unconscious			1
in the @entity22 , @entity98 and @entity99 , assisted suicide is illegal , though recent cases have been presented to high courts			1
" if @entity2 is happy to continue providing the facility then , however intellectually dishonest it may be to allow her to siphon of all our own @entity111 pain , fear , angst and debate , is it likely to do less harm overall than introducing any conceivable assisted suicide law into @entity111 , " medical lawyer @entity102 wrote in a commentary accompanying the new journal study			1
an international survey of 12 @entity118 countries found the majority of people favor legalizing assisted suicide , according to the study authors			1
this seems to match opinion in the @entity124 , where four states -- @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 -- allow assisted suicide			1
opinion : suicide does n't set you free but others have argued that legalizing assisted suicide is not addressing the real issue , which is the need for better palliative care , and that assisted suicide laws would put vulnerable populations at risk			2
@entity140 of @entity141 , in an editorial accompanying the new study , writes that advocates for assisted suicide often have a friend or relative who experienced a long , painful death			2
" so the issue , " she writes , " may be a need to provide good end - of - life care			0
" " we need to start asking questions such as : is it appropriate to give antibiotics to a terminally ill patient who develops a chest infection ? it is possible that a tendency to carry on with curative treatment even in those clearly dying explains the general public 's support for ( assisted suicide )			2
" @entity140 cites data from @entity127 that suggests regulations put in place when assisted suicide was legalized are not always followed			2
" @entity165 is important , " she writes			0
" but it could be that , in matters of life and death , you can not create freedom for the few without taking away adequate safeguards for the many			0
