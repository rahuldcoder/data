less than a year ago , @entity0 , an evangelical pastor , was flying high			1
his hometown @entity1 were in the @entity2 , and the brash pastor scored a big , faith - fueled interview with five of the team 's top players , including quarterback @entity7			0
but in a remarkably fast fall from grace , @entity0 resigned tuesday as pastor of @entity10 , a congregation he founded 18 years ago and turned into a force in the mostly secular @entity12			1
in a statement , @entity14 ' board of overseers said @entity0 had n't committed any acts of " immorality , illegality or heresy " -- sins that have felled many a powerful pastor			1
instead , the board said , @entity0 is guilty of " arrogance , responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech , and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner			1
" @entity0 was not asked to leave , the board added , saying they were " surprised " to receive his resignation letter			1
in that letter , obtained by @entity33 , @entity0 says : " recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for @entity10			1
" the 43 - year - old pastor acknowledged that , " there are many things i have confessed and repented of , privately and publicly , as you are well aware			0
specifically , i have confessed to past pride , anger and a domineering spirit			0
" before his resignation , a number of @entity50 leaders fled the church , saying that @entity0 was not fit for leadership			1
he has also been accused of plagiarism and using a complex scheme to pad book sales			0
the pastor has apologized and said " mistakes were made			0
" the broader beef with @entity0 , though , seemed to be his more - macho - than - thou approach to fellow @entity63			1
according to @entity65 , the pastor had trolled online discussion forums under the pseudonym " @entity68 , " and lambasted the supposed rise of " male lesbians ; " " feman , " ( men who act like women , in his definition ) ; and " men who allow their wives to nag at them			0
" " while the discussion board itself was a bad idea , " @entity0 said in a letter obtained by @entity65 , " my decision to attack critics who were posting there ( i did so by posting under the character ' @entity68 ' ) was an even worse idea			1
" even before that revelation , @entity0 was highly controversial and almost comically outspoken			2
he once said that mainstream @entity63 had turned @entity88 into a " @entity89 , hippie , queer @entity91 , " and a " neutered and limp - wristed popular @entity92 of pop culture that ... would never talk about sin or send anyone to hell			0
" in a book he wrote with his wife in 2012 , @entity0 delved into serious detail about his sex life , leaving some reviewers , and almost as many @entity63 , a bit uncomfortable			2
for all that , though -- or maybe , because of all that -- @entity0 was pretty successful by many measures			2
he built @entity10 into a mini-empire , with 15 satellite locations and even a couple of universities			2
his books and sermons were read and heard by millions			0
in his resignation letter , @entity0 hints that his pastoral career is n't dead yet			0
" my journey , at age 43 , is far from over , " he writes , " i believe ( @entity117 ) has brought me a long way from some days i am not very proud of , and is making me more like him every day			0

@entity120 resigns from @entity10 , which he founded 18 years ago
@entity0 's congregation became force in mostly secular @entity12
@entity10 board said he was guilty of " arrogance , " " quick temper , " " harsh speech "
