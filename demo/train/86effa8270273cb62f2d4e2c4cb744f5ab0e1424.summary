@entity0 , @entity1 -- it was classic @entity4			1
it was sen. @entity6 's big night but before her speech even began , former president @entity4 reached out in his box and firmly embraced a young @entity11 - @entity10 man			1
@entity4 gripped the young man tightly ; to millions watching on television , it was clear he could feel @entity16 's pain			1
as he sat down for his wife 's headlining address , @entity4 's silent embrace of the 25 - year - old son of recently deceased @entity22 rep. @entity21 resonated loudly			1
rep. @entity21 , of course , was a solid and loyal @entity4 supporter , standing by the @entity25 even when many other black leaders were shifting their support to @entity28			1
then , in her speech , sen. @entity4 herself took a moment to mention @entity21 and her son			1
" steadfast in her beliefs , a fighter of uncommon grace , she was an inspiration to me and to us all , " @entity4 said			1
" our heart goes out to @entity21 's son , @entity38 " the public moment of recognition was the result of years of friendship			1
" i remember the first time president @entity4 ran for office [ in 1992 ] , " @entity16 told @entity2			2
" he came to @entity44			0
i must have been 8 years old			2
" my mother got the chance to meet him			0
... they have been best of friends ever since , " he said			0
and , perhaps , it was also a reminder that if you stand by the @entity25 , the @entity25 will stand by you			0
@entity21 endorsed @entity6 for president in april 2007 but with sen. @entity28 's success during the primaries , many @entity11 - @entity10 superdelegates came under pressure to back @entity28 instead			1
@entity21 , however , held steadfast even as others in her position switched their allegiance			2
" i 'm going to be with her until she says , ' @entity21 , i 'm no longer in this fight			2
you 're free to do something else , ' " @entity21 told @entity2 's @entity64 in march			1
" in politics , all you have is your word , " she added			0
she passed that same sense of commitment on to her son			2
" if you give somebody your word , you 're going to go ahead and do it , " @entity16 said the day after @entity6 's address to the @entity74			2
" otherwise , it 's not worth anything			0
" " the same goes in politics , " he added			0
" if you do n't have your word , you do n't really have anything to stand on in politics			0
so , that 's one thing i did learn [ from my mother ] at a very early age			0
" when sen. @entity4 asked @entity16 to sit with her husband during what was perhaps her most important speech to date , he agreed			2
" she always said that if you do n't stick by somebody in the bad times , you never know how good the good times are going to be , " @entity16 said , explaining his mother 's view of loyalty			0
@entity21 , 58 , died suddenly a week ago of a brain aneurysm			1
she was in her fifth term in the @entity100 and was the first @entity11 - @entity10 woman to represent @entity22 in the @entity100			0
what would @entity21 have thought of sen. @entity4 's call tuesday for @entity104 to unify behind @entity28 ? " she would 've been standing up , hooting and hollering saying , ' wow			1
that 's exactly what we needed			0
way to be a team player , ' " @entity16 said			0
in what some political analysts were calling the first speech of her second campaign for president , @entity6 did her part on stage			0
and , in the box , her husband held on tightly to the son of an old friend Â­ and sent a message of his own that may resonate as an important moment in the long - term resurrection of the @entity4 brand in @entity10 politics .			1
