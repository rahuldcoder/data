@entity0 , @entity1 -- with the wingspan of a jumbo jet and a scooter - sized engine , the @entity3 is a one of a kind			1
thanks to nearly 12,000 solar cells and four electrically - powered propellers , it 's the first aircraft in the world that can fly without any fuel -- day or night			1
the 63 - meter wide , 1,600 kilogram plane is already a record breaker , staying in the air for 26 unbroken hours in 2010			1
but it 's about more than just flying , says pilot @entity20			2
" we want to show what can be done with these technologies , " @entity20 said			0
" we can keep our quality of life but reduce our energy consumptions , reduce our dependency on oil and nuclear energy			2
" the idea for @entity3 came from @entity31 , the first man to travel non-stop around the world in a balloon			1
" we almost failed ( because of ) lack of fuel , " @entity31 said of his epic journey back in 1999			0
" at that moment , i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world it would be with no fuel at all			2
and that 's how the vision of solar impulse was born , " he said			2
but it was n't until he met @entity20 seven years ago that he began to fulfill that promise			0
with a budget of $ 134 million at their disposal , the @entity3 team have the sponsors and the support to realize their goal of flying around the world without fuel in 2014 -- a first in aviation history			1
" everything we do is new			0
each time it 's a pioneering step , " @entity31 said			0
" when the @entity59 did that first flight in 1903 , it took 25 years for @entity61 to cross the @entity62			0
( it then took ) another 25 years to have 100 passengers flying over the @entity62			0
" with fair winds behind them , @entity31 and @entity20 are confident that the future of solar flying is bright and that @entity3 will soar into the record books , securing their place in aviation history as 21st century pioneers of flight .			1

the @entity3 is a unique aircraft which uses solar energy
63 - meter wide wingspan is *similar* to *dimensions* of a jumbo jet
@entity1 team plan to fly non-stop around the globe in 2014
