-- since december 2010 , i have lived with death threats because i have documented and revealed corruption at the highest levels in the @entity6 government			1
my family has been attacked , i have to live with bodyguards and some of my sources have been killed or are in jail			0
but my case is just one of many			0
a large number of journalists and human rights activists -- as well as those who denounce corruption in @entity6 -- receive similar threats or have been killed			1
and the biggest danger is not in fact the drug cartels , but rather the government and business officials that work for them and fear exposure			1
my new book " @entity25 " is the result of five grueling years of research			2
over this time i gradually became immersed in a shadowy world full of traps , lies , betrayals , and contradictions			0
the data i present is backed up by numerous legal documents , and the testimony of many who witnessed the events first - hand			0
i met people involved in the @entity6 drug cartels and spoke to police and army officers , @entity45 government officials , professional hit men , and priests -- figures who know the drug trade inside out			1
from this i found complicity at the heart of @entity6 government , business , police and drug cartels			1

and things are getting worse			0
between january and july this year it is estimated that 10,000 people in @entity6 have died at the hands of the drug cartels			1
read more : @entity6 reports more than 26,000 missing the business of producing , trafficking and selling illicit drugs has become increasingly attractive to people around the world -- a lucrative market considering that consumption is increasing globally			1
@entity6 is now the world 's second largest cultivator of opium poppy and , according to the @entity80 , in 2007 was the largest foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine to the @entity45 market			1
the story of how @entity86 -- a man widely considered as the most powerful drug trafficker in the world -- became a great drug baron , the king of betrayal and bribery , and the boss of top federal police commanders , is intimately linked to a process of decay in @entity6 where two factors are constant : corruption , and an unbridled ambition for money and power			1

through dozens of statements given by cooks , laundry workers , inmates , detention officers , and prison police commanders it was confirmed to me that in 2001 @entity86 did not escape from @entity117 in that famous laundry cart : instead , high - ranking officials took him out , disguised as a policeman			0
semi-illiterate peasants like @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity86 would not have got far without the collusion of businessmen , politicians , and policemen , and all those who exercise everyday power from behind a false halo of legality			0
read more : are @entity134 , @entity135 ignoring @entity6 's drug war ? we see their faces all the time , not in the mug shots of most wanted felons put out by the attorney general 's office , but in the front - page stories , business sections , and society columns of the main papers			1
all these are the true godfathers of @entity148 , the true lords of the drug world			2
currently , all the old rules governing relations between the drug barons and the centers of economic and political power have broken down			0
the drug traffickers impose their own law			1
the businessmen who launder their money are their partners , while some local and federal officials are viewed as employees to be paid off in advance , for example by financing their political campaigns			0
the culture of terror encouraged by the criminal gangs through their grotesque violence produces a paralyzing fear at all levels of society			0
finishing this book demanded a constant battle against such fear			0
they have tried to convince us that the drug barons and their cronies are immovable and untouchable , but this book offers a modest demonstration of the contrary			0
as citizens or as journalists , we must never allow the state and the authorities to give up on their duty to provide security , and simply hand the country over to an outlaw network made up of drug traffickers , businessmen , and politicians			1
since its publication in @entity6 , " @entity25 " has sold more than 200,000 copies -- astounding in a country with high levels of poverty and incredibly low levels of literacy compared to the @entity45 - @entity202 book - buying market it seems to me that the tide of public opinion is changing in @entity6 ; people no longer accept the view that the @entity6 government are at war with the drug cartels			1
the levels of violence , murder , trafficking , child pornography and kidnapping in @entity6 at the moment is simply catastrophic			2
in line with the increase in drug consumption across the world , the cocaine business has become more powerful than anyone could have imagined			0
the money created from this has allowed drug cartel criminals to buy whatever they want -- whether that is people , governments , police , land or impunity			2
this corruption spreads across the world ; @entity202 has become on the biggest importers of @entity6 's trafficked drugs			1
it is important that people in @entity238 , @entity239 or @entity240 understand that when they buy a gram of cocaine they have blood on their hands			0
the world needs to work with @entity6 to combat this 21st - century form of warfare ; fight against drug trafficking and organized crime has to be global			2
* in response to @entity0 's request for comment on this article , the @entity251 to the @entity252 said the @entity6 government was fully committed to upholding the rule of law			1
" president @entity260 prioritizes a @entity6 in peace as the first national goal , " the embassy said			2
" @entity263 has been raised to the level of @entity265 , and is underpinned by a multidimensional security focus that puts the wellbeing of citizens and the forefront of its concerns , by emphasizing prevention and the reduction of crime			0
" this new focus is not only designed to enforce the law and , if need be , for the @entity265 to make use of force in order to guarantee safety , but also to counteract the vulnerabilities created by consumption and violence through the implementation of social programs			0
" read more : @entity286 -- stop ' war on drugs ' the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291 .			2

@entity291 says she has lived with death threats since revealing corruption in @entity6
she says @entity6 's drug traffickers impose their own law , encouraging terror
@entity6 's *narcotics* industry is estimated to have cost more than 60,000 lives in six years
@entity303 argues that people no longer view the government as being at war with the cartels
