@entity0 -- for six years , @entity2 worked as a commercial lawyer for a leading @entity5 law firm , complete with its long hours and fat pay check			1
but after she had her first child eight years ago she felt she had no choice but to swap the lifestyle for that of a stay - at - home mom			2
" i gave it up because i knew i could n't be a city lawyer and spend time with my kids , " she said			1
" after that i discounted myself because i knew that if i had been out of law for a few years , who was going to be interested in me ? " today , @entity2 is helping to run a company that allows highly qualified former city lawyers to work flexibly from home to fit in with family commitments			1
run by an all - woman core team , @entity26 , has around 100 lawyers and 250 legal translators on its books			2
the company was founded in 2010 by @entity31 and @entity32 in an attempt to harness the talents that are lost to the legal profession when women leave after having children			1
the exodus from the profession is stark			0
according to the @entity41 , there were 25,786 women solicitors in the @entity43 aged 26 - 35 last year , but only 17,524 aged 36 - 45 , and 9,622 aged 46 - 55			1
@entity31 said : " at the starting point in their careers , 70 % of lawyers are women , but at partner level just 12 % are women			0
" i had seen all these talented people dropping out of the profession around me and had the idea to go back and find out what all these women were doing			0
" these women feel they have been forgotten and their skills do n't matter anymore			2
" she added : " we have built a business around a skillset that has not been tapped into			0
we have fantastic lawyers of @entity63 caliber who can deliver results			0
" we are using people that have disappeared from the market			0
i 'm keen to challenge the idea that professional women with children should be given work out of sympathy rather than be seen as a fantastic business proposition			0
" also on leading women : why women will impact global economy as much as @entity77 @entity78 works as a legal outsourcing company , taking on support work for law firms and in - house legal departments			1
it then distributes the work to the lawyers on its books , who choose how many hours they want to work			2
@entity90 , the company 's marketing director , said : " this is not a compromise on the part of the lawyer or the client			0
the client is getting ' top brain ' for their money and the lawyers are totally committed			1
" the idea has been popular with some top names in the legal profession , who are keen to see the gender imbalance redressed			1
@entity107 , one of only a handful of women @entity109 in the @entity43 , has agreed to become chairwoman of @entity113 's advisory board when she retires from her job as group company secretary at @entity116 next year			2
she said : " there 's a hole in the market for somebody like @entity78 to tap a pool of talent that is otherwise being wasted			0
nobody else is doing that			0
" @entity107 said everyone in her own team of 100 lawyers at @entity116 was offered flexible working , but that was rare in private law firms			2
" most of their staff are willing to flog themselves to death , so ( the firms do n't worry ) if they lose a few good people , " she said			0
" if law firms used a bit of creativity in helping women get back after a career break , it would be a huge benefit to everybody			1
" also on leading women : $ 800 million biotech business started in a garage @entity147 , president of the @entity43 @entity41 , said : " the situation will only change if the legal sector takes resolute action by investing in specific career development support for women , improving support around maternity transition and addressing the lack of flexible working practices which continues to hinder women 's career development			1
" while the vast majority of lawyers on @entity78 's books are women , the firm also welcomes men who want flexible working			1
the lawyers were on average earning $ 160,000 ( Â £ 100,000 ) before their career breaks , and are now paid an equivalent hourly rate			1
" what do we want to say to our daughters ? " said @entity32 , co-founder of @entity113			0
" that law is a great profession until you have children ? "			0

in the @entity43 , the legal profession loses a huge number of women after career breaks
city lawyer mothers feel they ca n't balance long hours with child *rearing*
firm offers flexible home working for former high - *flying* lawyers
clients benefit from " top brain " lawyers otherwise out of work , says firm
