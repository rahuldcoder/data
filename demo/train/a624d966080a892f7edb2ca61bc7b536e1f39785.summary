-- people have always known that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive			1
what is surprising , now that we have the data to compare societies , is how clear the effects of inequality are			2
a wide range of social problems are worse in societies with bigger income differences between rich and poor			1
these include physical and mental illness , violence , low math and literacy scores among young people , lower levels of trust and weaker community life , poorer child well - being , more drug abuse , lower social mobility and higher rates of imprisonment and teenage births			1
the differences in performance of more and less equal societies is often enormous : most of these problems are between twice and ten times as common in countries like the @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , which have large income differences compared to countries with smaller income differences like the @entity34 or @entity41			1
for example , taking high , medium and low inequality countries , the homicide rate in the @entity35 in 2009 was 50 per million population compared with 18 in @entity46 and 5 in @entity41			1
the police , prisons and public services needed to defend ourselves against these problems are expensive and often not very effective			0
but the underlying causal processes are fairly clear			0
the problems that get worse when there is more inequality are all problems that become more common lower down the social ladder within each society			1
@entity58 : what explains trust and morality greater income inequality seems to amplify and intensify the effects of social status differentiation -- bigger material differences creating bigger social distances			1
so the most common trigger to violence seems to be people feeling disrespected and looked down on			0
although social class imprints its effects on us from earliest childhood onward , greater inequality makes these effects more marked			1
but inequality does not harm the poor alone			0
the effects are so large because almost everyone is affected			0
the benefits of greater inequality are biggest at the bottom of society , but a number of studies suggest that a large majority -- perhaps 90 % or 95 % -- of the population benefits from greater equality			2
we can not say what happens to the superrich because they are a fraction of 1 % of the population and we do not have separate data on their health , violence or drug use			0
because position in the hierarchy has always been important to well - being , we have an inherited sensitivity to social status that works rather like ranking systems among some monkeys			1
however , human beings have lived in every kind of society from the most egalitarian ( such as the hunting and gathering societies of human prehistory ) to the most tyrannical dictatorships			0
where there is more equality we use more cooperative social strategies , but where there is more inequality , people feel they have to fend for themselves and competition for status becomes more important			1
@entity58 : how we read each other 's minds crucially important is the quality of social relationships			2
because members of the same species have the same needs , they can , all too easily , be each other 's worst rivals -- fighting for food , nesting sites , territories , sexual partners and so on			0
but human beings , as well as having the potential to be each other 's most feared rivals and competitors , also have the opposite potential : we can be each other 's best sources of cooperation , assistance , help , learning and love			2
depending on our social relationships , other people can be the best -- or the worst			2
of paramount importance in our social development was to avoid conflict and competition for basic necessities			0
that is why we eat together			0
it is also what the religious symbolism of communion is about			0
whether society has great inequality and a strong status hierarchy , whether there is a strong sense of superiority and inferiority , tells us whether we are in the same boat together and depend on cooperation and reciprocity , or whether we have to fend for ourselves in a dog - eat - dog society			1
what matters is not simply adults ' recognition of inequality and social status ; it is also a matter of how the parental experience of adversity is passed on to children to affect their early development			1
the sensitive period in early childhood that shapes development exists in many different species			0
its function is to enable the young to adapt to the kind of environment they will have to deal with			0
among human beings , that is primarily a matter of adapting to the social environment : are you growing up in a world where you will have to fight for what you can get , watch your back and learn not to trust others because we are all rivals , or are you growing up in a world where you will depend on cooperation , reciprocity and mutuality ? * * if you want a fuller picture of how we are affected by inequality or would like to use our slides or read answers to various " frequently asked questions , " please go to www.equalitytrust.org.uk			1
a more detailed but readable presentation of the evidence can be found in our book , " @entity211 , " which i wrote with @entity213 , who is , like me , an epidemiologist			0
( note : in @entity214 a " spirit level " is simply the tool used by carpenters and builders that most @entity35 's call a " level			2
" ) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : evidence *confirms* that inequality causes social problems
social ills in @entity35 , @entity36 can be up to 10 times greater than in more equal countries
when there 's more inequality , people become *desperate* for higher social status , he says
@entity224 : children trained either for world of *constant* struggle or for cooperation
