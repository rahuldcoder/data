-- twelve months ago , @entity2 's president @entity1 gave his people a bizarre @entity5 present : he announced the immediate removal of fuel subsidies			1
the controversial measure meant that , quite suddenly , citizens were to pay as much as three times the usual price for gasoline			0
they filled the nation 's streets in protest			0
the coalition was broad : young and old , female and male , poor and ( some ) rich			0
their action , often spontaneous but orchestrated by labor leaders , amounted to a fierce rebuke to @entity1 's administration			0
the government 's unilateral decision was a recipe for new levels of extreme hardship for the poor , taxed already by low wages , ballooning unemployment , a high cost of living , shambling infrastructure -- and the @entity33 greed of the elite class			0
the protesters quickly adopted the banner of " @entity37			1
" they were animated by a global movement of activists standing up against what they saw as economic exploitation and corruption perpetrated by @entity44 governments , often with the tacit encouragement of powerful corporations			1
however , " @entity37 " was different from other " @entity48 " movements			1
there was a good reason for this			0
@entity2 's activist voice had gone silent for too long			1
the country 's streets had not felt the pounding of mass protests since the mid- 90s , when a coalition of student activists , labor leaders , political activists , lawyers , doctors , academics , artisans and other civil society groups meshed into a powerful pro-democracy movement to drive the military from power			1
in fact , last january 's " @entity37 " protests were largely heralded and led by young people who were born in the early and mid- 90s -- a generation that has come to view and use social media as its primary means of activism , social mores and political empowerment			1
in january 2012 , that mass movement put the bloated @entity2 government in the crosshairs			1
it 's believed to be @entity2 's biggest ever national mass protest			1
apart from its sheer size , the movement managed to endure for days and weeks			2
and , in some ways , it set some impressive , unthinkable marks			0
for instance , some considered it unimaginable that @entity2 ( often portrayed as too " happy , " too timid and cowardly , too polarized along ethno - religious lines ) would unite behind a common cause			1
also , it was unthinkable that a mass uprising would start from the nation 's capital of @entity97 , considered a fortress of the ruling interests			2
yet , an intrepid former legislator , @entity100 , sparked the protests with a petition drive that ignited a nationwide uprising			2
see also : why @entity2 are no longer content with ' suffering and smiling ' in a country factionalized along ethnic and religious lines , the movement defied all odds			1
in @entity112 , for example , a radical fiery @entity109 preacher , @entity108 of the @entity110 , anchored the protests			2
in @entity114 , the protests were led by @entity115 , a veteran activist and @entity117 of the @entity118			2
his religious faith did n't faze young @entity109 protesters determined to fight for their rights			2
in some parts of the country , the protests seemed far less organized			2
it was difficult to determine who was in charge in of them			0
there was also another novel aspect of the movement			2
@entity2 across the world also joined the protests to a degree never - before seen			1
in rally after rally , in the @entity134 , the @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 , they made their voices heard			0
in @entity141 , @entity2 staged four different actions			1
the most dramatic was a showdown with a @entity2 minister sent by the @entity1 administration to calm the tempers of @entity2 who felt justifiably insulted by the ill - advised removal of oil subsidies			1
her so - called " @entity154 " meeting at a five - star hotel in @entity153 was effectively shut down , and the minister disgraced			0
nigerians in @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 , @entity162 , were soon protesting at the country 's embassies demanding change			0
but the biggest surprise was the protest movement 's peaceful nature , especially at a time when the nation was gripped by violent militant groups and armed criminal gangs			2
despite provocation by the security agencies and police , the protests were mostly civil and peaceful			2
the only deaths and injuries recorded in @entity179 , @entity112 , @entity180 , @entity97 and @entity114 were reportedly inflicted by the police and soldiers unleashed on hapless citizens			0
see also : opinion : @entity2 is a sinking ship - do n't desert it but a year later , it 's difficult to argue that the movement achieved its goal			1
for its size , its failure to compel any serious measures to curb the culture of impunity and corruption in @entity2 is significant			1
so , what went wrong ? why did the movement crumble in its cradle ? these questions perplexed several traditional activist groups and @entity201 who were busy attending meetings with the government to seek an amicable resolution to the crisis			2
one major reason for the quick collapse was the movement 's lack of a central command structure			2
to some extent , it was a leaderless , but not rudderless affair			0
as the publisher of @entity216 , i witnessed the crystallization of a citizen journalist movement			2
many citizens wrote and posted reports of the mass protests			1
they did n't wait around for their stories to be told in distorting sound bites by the foreign media or twisted by a mostly compromised local media			0
these citizen reporters sent photos , videos and texts			0
they tweeted , texted and analyzed every minute of the struggle from all over the country and the world , bringing the integrity of their witness to bear			0
saharareporters kept up its side of the bargain ; we published the " field " reports in a timely manner			0
see also : @entity244 : unrest in @entity2 for a moment , many @entity2 hoped that the " @entity48 " movement would transition into the first @entity246 ( or @entity247 )			1
a year later , the conclusion is sobering			0
it is clear that " @entity37 " failed to metamorphose into a genuine , sustained mass movement			1
the central labor unions that were initially trusted to lead the movement capitulated quickly under the weight of accusations that they were conniving to overthrow the government			2
the @entity2 army , notorious for its legacy of intervening to protect the country 's corrupt status quo , was deployed to quell the protests			1
on the bright side , the @entity2 people , especially the younger generation , got a taste of people power			1
i have no doubt that they can -- and will -- exercise that power again			0
few as they were , some immediate gains testified to the power of the mass uprising			2
after two national addresses , a brow - beaten president @entity1 rolled back fuel prices and reinstated some fuel subsidy			0
and he made a commitment -- far from realized -- to identify and punish profiteers from fuel subsidy scams			0
for @entity2 , one lesson is that they possess a latent power capable of bringing change -- if only the people will it			1
there are also important lessons about opportunists and saboteurs			0
it was n't hard to see their trails during and after the mass protests			1
the protests had hardly died down when some of the labor leaders found their way into plush government committees			0
others formed themselves into " stakeholders " and began earnestly to jostle for government patronage even as the issues that sparked the protests had not been addressed			0
even so , i believe the awareness created about the pervasive corruption in the oil sector made a difference			0
but it was not the issue			0
after all , @entity2 already knew government officials and their corporate accomplices were stealing			1
" @entity37 " simply washed the carcass of the whale of corruption ashore			1
the eventual revelation by a parliamentary committee that a grand sum of $ 6.8 billion had been stolen through subsidy scams is a yet unresolved scandal			0
@entity2 suspect , with good reason , that their top government officials are in no hurry to unmask the gluttonous embezzlers of fuel subsidies			1
in fact , the impression is that the culprits , law enforcement officials , and the judges have all retired to their usual zone of criminal complicity and comfort			0
no one will be punished			0
as the people of @entity2 still hanker for their @entity335 " @entity334 , " the " @entity48 " movement can re-emerge at any time to take @entity2 by storm			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity339 .			1

in january 2012 , @entity2 protested the removal of fuel subsidies
protests united @entity2 , often divided along ethnic and religious lines , says @entity339
but " @entity37 " failed to become a genuine , sustained mass movement , he argues
@entity339 says @entity2 still hanker for their " @entity350 "
