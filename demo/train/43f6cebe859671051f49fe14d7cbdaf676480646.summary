-- lawyers for @entity3 bombing suspect @entity2 asked a federal court thursday to strike his alleged " betrayal " of the @entity9 as an aggravating factor for seeking the death penalty against him			1
a defense motion accused prosecutors of trying to use the suspect 's foreign birth and immigration to imply that @entity2 is " more blameworthy , and more deserving of severe punishment " than a native - born person who commits the identical crime			1
" the ' betrayal ' factor has no legally permissible role in this case , and can only serve to promote invidious discrimination based on national origin and immigration status , " the defense motion said			0
the @entity2 family originally came from @entity26 , a war - torn corner of southwestern @entity29 where @entity31 guerrillas have been battling government forces for a decade and a half			2
@entity2 and his older brother @entity34 were born in @entity35			0
@entity2 had become an @entity9 citizen , while @entity34 's application was still pending when the bombing occurred			1
@entity2 , 20 , is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race , along with @entity34 , who was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed @entity43			1
the city marked the anniversary of the attacks on april 15 , pausing to remember the three people who died and the more than 200 who were wounded , many of whom lost limbs			0
the trial is set for early november , with the government seeking the death penalty			1
defense lawyers are expected to argue that the younger @entity2 was under the " domination and control " of his brother			2
" resentment of @entity2 's immigration status and history is perhaps natural , given the nature of the crimes charged , and it is surely very widespread , " @entity2 's lawyers said in the motion			2
" but the fact that he had only recently become a citizen , standing alone , does not increase his moral or legal guilt , and it should not be permitted			0
" in the notice to seek the death penalty , prosecutors said : " @entity2 received asylum from the @entity9 ; obtained citizenship and enjoyed the freedoms of a @entity9 citizen ; and then betrayed his allegiance to the @entity9 by killing and maiming people in the @entity9			1
" on wednesday , federal prosecutors filed court papers asking that the family visits of the jailed suspect be monitored to ensure they are not used to convey hidden messages , according to court documents			2
prosecutors said @entity2 's conversations with his mother , now in the @entity29 republic of @entity88 , have raised the possibility that the defendant might use social visits " to communicate with third parties			1
" in phone calls with him , his mother twice mentioned that she had contact with close friends of @entity34 , according to prosecutors			0
in a hearing last month , @entity9 district judge @entity98 appeared to side with the defense argument that visits between @entity2 and his sisters should not be monitored by the @entity102			1
defense lawyer @entity103 argued that letting federal agents monitor the conversations intruded on the defense			0
" the decision to take the most casual remarks , an ironic comment , and provide it to the prosecution ... becomes ammunition on the death penalty , " @entity103 said			2
if the charges against @entity2 are true , he said , " this is about a family , " and lawyers should be allowed to observe the relationship between the siblings without interference			0
in wednesday 's court filing , assistant u.s. attorney @entity121 said some of @entity2 's telephone conversations while in prison " have raised the possibility he might seek to use social visits to communicate with third parties			1
" @entity98 has said he would make a decision after considering the prosecution 's response			0
separately , @entity2 's defense team expressed concern about its ability to be " adequately prepared " for the november 3 trial date			1
in another motion , defense attorneys said they need more information from the government 's investigation into the explosive device and other forensic evidence			0
" it can not be ignored that the aggressive timeline for bringing this complicated and multifaceted case to trial dramatically compresses the time available for the defense to adequately prepare for trial , " attorneys @entity143 and @entity103 wrote .			0
