@entity0 rubs his chin with his forefinger ; his face obscured by a blue baseball cap			0
we sit together in the back of a taxi beside a frigid river near @entity10 's bleak northeastern border with @entity11			1
he 's traveling with @entity10 smuggling gangs or " snakeheads			1
" they fed and clothed him when he escaped			0
@entity0 speaks in staccato sentences			0
" i was a soldier , " he says , " i did something on the base and i had to flee			0
" @entity0 wo n't say what he did and we ca n't give his real name for his own safety			0
he wants to protect his wife and child in @entity11			2
whatever the reason , it compelled him to flee like thousands before him			0
@entity28 officials , human rights activists and smugglers say @entity11 refugees face a daunting journey to reach asylum in @entity34			1
and crossing into @entity10 is often the easiest part of the whole process			2
" we all know how to escape to @entity10			1
a lot people in @entity11 know how to do it , " says @entity0			2
underground network for years , an established underground network got refugees like @entity0 out			0
charities and @entity34 evangelical groups ran a kind of underground railroad for @entity11 out of @entity47 , a booming border city in @entity10			1
but in recent years , the @entity10 government has tightened border controls and clamped down on these groups			1
now refugees must depend on snakeheads			0
" they have to operate in the shadows , " says @entity53 , the @entity54 of the @entity55 for @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , " because if they come out of @entity11 and get noticed , they will be sent home			2
" @entity10 has a uniform policy of sending refugees back to the autocratic regime they fled			1
in fact , @entity10 does n't refer to fleeing @entity11 as refugees at all			1
they call them " illegal economic migrants			0
" last month @entity70 , the @entity34 news agency , reported that 11 @entity11 defectors were arrested by @entity10 police as they tried to enter @entity73 , which borders southern @entity10			1
one was just seven years old			0
if the @entity11 are caught and sent back , experts say , they face a litany of human rights abuses			2
" persons who are forcibly repatriated from @entity10 are commonly subjected to torture , arbitrary detention , summary execution , forced abortion and other forms of sexual violence , " states a damning @entity28 report on the @entity81 situation in @entity11			1
the report calls on @entity10 to give the @entity91 agency ( @entity90 ) access to fleeing @entity11 , something that @entity10 currently does n't allow			1
" @entity10 is , frankly , shamelessly violating its international obligations , " says @entity94 of @entity95 , " @entity10 has ratified the refugee convention and should be treating these people who are fleeing from @entity11 as refugees			1
" fear of @entity11 influx in a written submission to the @entity28 , @entity10 rejected the " unfounded allegations " relating to @entity10 in the @entity28 @entity106 's report into @entity11 , and hinted that the research was politicized			1
@entity10 did not allow the @entity28 commission to investigate the situation inside @entity10			2
@entity94 says @entity10 fears an influx of @entity11 into the country if it eases its rules for defectors			1
the @entity113 fears any instability in @entity11 or within its own borders , so the argument holds weight			2
because of @entity10 's policy , the passage to @entity119 is a daunting one			2
" from @entity11 , people have to take advantage of smuggling rings to get out			2
there are pre-established ways for safe passage , " says @entity53 of @entity57 , " a steady stream of people are making the journey			0
" he says that @entity11 will often try to travel in small groups			2
according to @entity95 , @entity11 will switch cars regularly and make the journey by land from the border to @entity135			1
travel by rail or air is impossible because they have no paperwork			0
but last year , the @entity135 government alarmed human rights groups when they sent back a group of young defectors to @entity11 via @entity10			1
if @entity11 make it through the border into @entity10 , and somehow manage to evade @entity10 security authorities for thousands of miles , they must then sneak through @entity135 territory , and make their way into @entity151			1
" @entity151 is the promised land , " says @entity94 , because @entity11 found there are deported to @entity34			1
" @entity151 considers that @entity11 can be sent to @entity34 since the @entity34 constitution sets out that all @entity11 are citizens of the @entity34 , " he says			1
yet when they arrive in @entity34 , @entity94 says the story is not over			0
the smugglers have to be paid			0
@entity34 's government provides " start - up money " for defectors , which as the name suggests , is cash to help them settle			1
but many end up using it to pay off their debts to smugglers and brokers			0
@entity94 says if they ca n't pay , the smuggling can turn into human trafficking			0
but @entity0 is only at the very start of this long journey			0
he says the @entity10 smugglers have clothed and fed him and he hopes to meet us in @entity119 one day			0
despite all of the risks he 's determined to make it			0
" if there is a time in the future , let 's meet and talk , " he says			0
opinion : moment of truth for @entity11 over human rights			0

@entity186 's @entity185 spends time with recent defector from @entity11
he tells of the *harrowing* escape into @entity10 , only the start of his journey to @entity34
defectors forced to use smuggling gangs to escape the regime , as @entity10 will send them back
@entity151 is " the promised land , " as authorities will send them on to @entity34
