-- evocative , unusual and perhaps a little disquieting , @entity2 's photos of @entity3 can inspire a variety of reactions			1
from coasts to rivers and lakesides , her seemingly semi-submerged photographs frame water and land as if taken by a castaway catching sight of shore , presenting a unique perspective of the country			1
since 2001 @entity2 has been using an all - weather film camera to take the series of photos that were first grouped under the title " @entity21 and @entity21 in the water			1
" using an all - weather film camera she has traveled across @entity3 in all seasons , wearing a bathing suit in summer or fishing waders in winter months , and sometime taking to a boat or canoe to capture the shots			1
" after much trial and error , i realized that it was better to give a sense of the water in the foreground , and gradually i took more photographs positioned as though the lens was put partially in the water , " @entity2 told @entity0 via email			1
" when i first started shooting this series , i imagined shooting all the way around @entity3 from the sea			1
but as i progressed , i felt this framework is not necessary for me , so i shoot both in @entity3 and other places			1
" her latest book " ever after " is a continuation of that first series and saw travel across the world shooting in new locations			2
but her singular views of @entity3 are perhaps the most captivating			2
the commingling of the natural and the man - made is a consistent theme for @entity2			2
" ( in @entity3 ) nature exists within reach of people , " she said			2
" you 'll find old and new buildings or billboards and other artificial things randomly mixed along with nature			0
the natural and man - made are constructing landscapes while permeating each other			0
" but as the tsunami of 2011 illustrated to devastating effect , the natural and human worlds do not exist in harmony			2
the catastrophe also had a significant impact on @entity2 and her photography			0
" after seeing the images of the 3/11 tsunami , knowing the scope of the disaster , it was a time when i questioned whether i could continue to shoot in the same manner as before , " she said			1
" since i began the series i had been thinking that both ' fear ' and ' consolation ' are in my photographs in the state of being suspended in mid-air , unable to go up or down			0
but after 3/11 , i felt like the pendulum had swung to the ' fear ' side			0
" the only answer i could find was to continue to take photographs			0
in last few years , i 'm continuing to shoot in the sea but i have more occasions to shoot in rivers and lakes in ( the ) last few years than before			0
" @entity0 's @entity97 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
