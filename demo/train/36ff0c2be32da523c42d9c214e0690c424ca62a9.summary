@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity4 tourists strolling in the sun - drenched squares in the @entity8 town of @entity0 , @entity1 is a pocket of hospitality in a world that has largely closed its doors to them			1
in @entity1 , that all changed last year when the former @entity15 republic lifted its visa requirements for @entity4 and the tourists started flowing in			1
while the numbers are still modest , @entity1 government statistics show a tripling of @entity4 tourists so far this year with visitors now in the tens of thousands			1
" when i describe the possibilities , the potential , they are very eager , and they will come , they 're very interested to come more , " says @entity24 , an @entity25 now living in @entity1			0
" @entity1 is very near to @entity4 , it is very easy to get a bus or a flight to come here ... without needing a visa , " gushed one @entity4 visitor as she took in the historical sites in @entity0			1
but there is more to this relationship than attracting sun - seeking tourists			0
" desperately seeking a way out of its energy and economic dependence on @entity48 , @entity1 considers @entity4 as an alternative supplier of energy , and both sides have renewed their drive for an energy partnership , " writes @entity42 of @entity43 in a recent diplomatic journal			2
last month , a few dozen @entity4 business leaders arrived in @entity1 to seek investment opportunities in transport , agriculture and construction			1
and as well as having an active @entity4 embassy in the @entity1 capital @entity61 , @entity4 recently opened a consulate here in @entity0			2
in fact , @entity4 fits into @entity1 's aggressive strategy to court foreign direct investment however and wherever it can			1
" interest towards our country as a place for investment and trade has been quite high			0
in 2012 we 've already held investment seminars practically in all counties of gulf region , " says @entity73 , first deputy director at the @entity74			0
this is a delicate relationship though as @entity1 continues to seek membership in both the @entity80 and @entity81 and remains one of the strongest @entity84 allies in the region			0
neither @entity4 nor @entity1 was eager to discuss the growing relationship beyond published statements and for good reason			2
@entity1 does not want to be seen as skirting @entity90 - sponsored sanctions against @entity4			1
@entity4 business people we spoke to here would not disclose how sanctions were handled in @entity1 except to say that the sanctions pose hurdles in all countries in which they try to do business			2
in fact , @entity1 has been a shrewd geopolitical player especially since it now believes it is no longer a @entity90 policy priority in the region			1
" @entity1 's current policy toward @entity4 is not irrational			0
closer relations with @entity4 , despite extremely tense relations between @entity104 and @entity105 , is an indication of @entity61 's disillusionment with what it sees as the @entity110 's weakening interest in @entity1 , as well as its desire to expand its room for maneuvering , politically and economically , " writes @entity42			1
for now , the @entity90 continues to claim that @entity4 is becoming more isolated financially and diplomatically			0
that may be true in many places around the world , but not here in @entity1			0
@entity2 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity2 retains full editorial control over all of its reports .			0

@entity4 *increasingly* see @entity1 as an attractive tourism *destination*
@entity1 keen to attract investment from the region
*experts* *suggest* @entity1 wants to court @entity4 but not *damage* @entity90 relations
