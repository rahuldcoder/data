pushing her meal cart into the hospital room , a research assistant hands out tall glasses of reddish - pink liquid , along with a gentle warning : " remember , you guys have to finish all your kool - aid			0
" one by one , young volunteers chug down their drinks , each carefully calibrated to contain a mix of water , flavoring and a precisely calibrated solution of high fructose corn syrup : 55 % fructose , 45 % glucose			1
the participants are part of an ongoing study run by @entity22 , a nutritional biologist at the @entity23			0
volunteers agree to spend several weeks as lab rats : their food carefully measured , their bodies subjected to a steady dose of scans and blood tests			0
at first , each volunteer receives meals with no added sugars			0
but then , the sweetened drinks start showing up			1
for the final two weeks of the study , volunteers drank three of the sweet concoctions daily -- about 500 calories of added sugar , or 25 % of all calories for the adult women in the study			1
within just two weeks , their blood chemistry was out of whack			0
in one striking change , the volunteers had elevated levels of ldl cholesterol , a risk factor for heart disease			0
while force - feeding junk food may sound extreme , this controlled diet is not so far from the real world			0
a 20 - ounce regular soda contains 227 calories , according to the @entity56 @entity55 ( @entity55 )			1
that single drink is more than 10 % of the total calories an adult woman needs to maintain a healthy weight , according to @entity55 diet guidelines			1
meanwhile , about 1 in 4 @entity56 gets at least 200 calories a day from sugary drinks			1
these numbers , along with work like @entity66 's , gives ammunition to doctors and public health officials who say soda should be treated as public health enemy no. 1			1
" soft drinks and sugar - containing beverages are the low hanging fruit in public health today , " says dr. @entity72 , director of the @entity73 , at @entity74 in @entity75			1
" many children are consuming 300 calories per day or more , just in sugar - containing beverages			1
compare the challenge of giving up three glasses of sugary beverages , versus getting them to do two hours of moderate physical activity			2
" " if you switch from @entity94 to water , that 's easy , " says @entity88 , a professor at the @entity89 and a recent president of the @entity91			0
" you do n't have to make big complicated changes in how you cook , and shop , and all that			0
and the number of calories you can save , can be substantial			2
" related story : are sugar substitutes worse than the real thing ? some in the soft drink business say their product has been unfairly singled out			1
" consumption of added sugars is going down , " says @entity106 , vice-president of @entity107 for the @entity108			2
" @entity112 consumption has declined , even as obesity has increased			1
to say that sugar is solely responsible for obesity , does n't make sense			2
" @entity94 has adapted to meet consumer demand , says @entity118 , the company 's vice president and chief scientific regulatory officer			0
more than ever , she says , those consumers choose low - sugar products			0
today , @entity123 and @entity124 make up 41 % of @entity94 's @entity126 soda sales , up from 32 % a decade ago			2
" our products are part of a balanced , sensible diet , and they can be enjoyed as a valuable part of any meal , including snacks , " says @entity118			0
buried in the flood of horror stories about @entity56 's obesity crisis , are a few hopeful signs			1
not only is sugar consumption going down , but obesity rates among girls and women have actually stayed flat since 1999 , according to @entity142 , a scientist with the @entity143 ( @entity143 )			1
for boys and men , those levels have increased only modestly since around 2006 , @entity142 says			2
coincidentally or not , the leveling off of obesity coincides with a drop in the amount of soda that @entity56 consume			1
consumption of soda -- both regular and diet -- has fallen by 17.3 % since 1998 , according to @entity155			1
@entity156 : how i kicked my @entity94 habit of course soda is n't the only concern			2
an 8 - ounce glass of fruit punch or apple juice has nearly 130 calories			2
the same glass of chocolate milk has more than 200 -- a solid 20 percent of all recommended daily calories			1
overall , added sugars -- which includes both natural sugar , and high fructose corn syrup -- make up about a sixth of all calories taken in , according to @entity55 figures			2
somewhat more than a third of those sugars come from soda and other drinks			1
that 's why most people who take a hard look at @entity126 diets say that cutting out sweetened drinks , is the first step for anyone struggling with weight or diabetes			1
" if we create the assumption that doing one thing will reduce the epidemic [ of obesity ] , we 're making a mistake , " says dr. @entity187 , director of the @entity143 's @entity188 , @entity189 , and @entity190			2
" but within the dietary side , we have to focus on where the biggest action is			0
" the action , says @entity187 and others , lies with sugar and its close cousin , high - fructose corn syrup ( @entity204 )			0
most sweet drinks , including nearly all soda in the @entity56 , use @entity204			1
not everyone agrees they 're equivalent			0
while most studies show that table sugar and @entity204 play an equal role in weight gain , some research suggests that @entity204 -- which usually contains 10 % more fructose than sucrose -- is more likely to change the body 's metabolism , in ways that can increase risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes			0
but most scientists say the differences are subtle			0
that includes even @entity66 , whose work has focused on comparing the effects of fructose and other sugars			0
in terms of advising patients or making public health policy , she says , there is n't much difference			0
" i think we really , at this point , need to treat them all alike			0
" " are sweetened drinks the only reason we have epidemics of obesity and diabetes ? no , they 're not , " says @entity243 , the past @entity91 president			1
" but sometimes the easy answer , is the answer			0

about 1 in 4 @entity56 gets at least 200 calories a day from sugary drinks
although soda consumption has declined , @entity56 obesity has increased
many *experts* say cutting sweetened drinks would fight obesity or diabetes
soft drink *industry* says their product has been unfairly singled out
