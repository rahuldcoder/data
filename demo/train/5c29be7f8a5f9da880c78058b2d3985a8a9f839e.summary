-- pope @entity1 used to beat himself with a belt and sleep on a bare floor to bring himself closer to @entity5 , a book published wednesday says			1
the late pope had a particular belt for self - flagellation and brought it with him to his summer residence , according to the book , " why he is a @entity11 : the true story of @entity1 " " as some members of his own entourage were able to hear with their own ears , both in @entity19 and in the @entity20 , @entity1 flagellated himself , " the book says , using the name the pope was given at birth			1
" in the closet , among the cloaks , a particular pant - belt hung from a hook , which he utilized as a whip and one which he always had brought to @entity28 , " the book says			1
the book was written by a @entity20 insider , @entity29 , with @entity31 journalist @entity30 of the @entity32			1
@entity29 is head of the @entity20 committee investigating whether @entity1 should be declared a saint			1
the evil albino monk in @entity37 's " the @entity36 " may be the best - known example of self - flagellation these days , but the practice is not unusual in @entity41 -- or nearly as extreme as it is shown in the movie			1
" when members or former members [ of @entity45 ] see the monk go at it in the movie , they just burst out laughing , it 's so nutty , " said the rev. @entity43 , a priest of the @entity45 sect			0
in actual @entity32 self - flagellation , " there is no blood , no injury , nothing to harm a person 's health , nothing traumatic			1
if it caused any harm , the @entity63 would not allow it , " he wrote on @entity45 's web site when the movie came out in 2006			1
" this voluntarily accepted discomfort is a way of joining oneself to @entity5 and the sufferings he voluntarily accepted in order to redeem us from sin			0
' the @entity36 's ' masochist monk , who loves pain for its own sake , has nothing to do with real @entity77 mortification , " @entity43 said			0
@entity78 is among famous @entity79 who self - flagellated in some way , @entity43 said			2
@entity79 are not alone in choosing to inflict pain on themselves for religion reasons			0
some @entity83 lash themselves until they bleed when marking the mourning period of @entity85 , while fasting is practiced by people in several religions , including @entity89 on @entity90 , the day of atonement			2
@entity92 , a journalist who worked for @entity93 when @entity1 was pope , pointed out that the pontiff wrote an apostolic letter -- essentially a papal position paper -- on suffering in 1984			1
" @entity5 did not conceal from his listeners the need for suffering			2
he said very clearly : ' if any man would come after me ... let him take up his cross daily , ' " the pope wrote , quoting the @entity103			2
@entity5 , the pope wrote , " suffered in place of man and for man			2
every man has his own share in the redemption			0
each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the redemption was accomplished			2
" in bringing about the redemption through suffering , @entity5 has also raised human suffering to the level of the redemption			0
thus each man , in his suffering , can also become a sharer in the redemptive suffering of @entity5 , " says the letter , @entity123 , on the @entity124			1
" @entity1 was a product of a very @entity41 , " said @entity92 , who now writes on religion for @entity126			1
" he was a very disciplined man and a very rigorous man in his personal spirituality , " he said			0
the authors of the new book clearly approve of any whipping the pope did of himself , he added			0
" even though it 's going to weird people out , it 's obviously seen by his postulators as a sign of his holiness , " he said , using the technical term for the person who investigates a person 's qualifications for sainthood			0
he said the idea is not as bizarre as it might sound to contemporary ears			0
" the idea of fasting , renouncing something , giving up your @entity151 latte so you can send money to @entity154 -- you ca n't simply look down your nose at it without rejecting a lot of other ideas about self - sacrifice , " he said			1
the authors of the book based it on interviews with 114 " witnesses " and access to unedited documents in the @entity20 's archives , according to the publisher , @entity167			0
the book is available only in @entity31 , but the publisher is having it translated into @entity19 and other languages .			0
