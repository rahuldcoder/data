@entity0 -- in @entity0 , where huge protests are now in their fourth day , the angry protesters in @entity3 are reclaiming the pro-democracy revolution they started january 25			1
since it took control of the management of the transitional process , the @entity6 -- appointed by the former president , @entity7 -- has been following a three - sided strategy to contain and even frustrate the persistent demands for handing over power to a civilian authority and establishing an effective democratic system			2
the military council is breaking the revolutionary will of the protesters by arresting many and putting them in military courts ( 12,000 civilians so far ) ; deliberately humiliating them ( torturing many and exposing female protesters to virginity tests ) ; making ordinary people feel disillusioned and even hate the revolution by failing to take tough measures against anarchy and restore law and order ; and finally , encouraging fragmentation and discord among the country 's political actors			1
like @entity7 , the military council has adopted the policy of " me or anarchy			2
" over the past few months , @entity38 have used enormous demonstrations to press their demands , starting with insisting on dismissing the government that @entity7 had appointed before he was ousted , purging the security forces and cleaning the @entity43 , trying @entity7 and those responsible for the death of more than 800 peaceful protesters and the injury of thousands , and setting a clear and specific timetable for handing over power to civilians			1
the military council has been reluctant to respond , and when it has , it has completely emptied these demands of any meaningful effect			2
indeed , it appointed a new @entity53 in march but deprived it of any effective authority			0
it changed the name of the state security force while maintaining its old structure and savage practices , and it reluctantly put @entity7 and some of his aides before trial , but none has been indicted , and the process has been incredibly slow			0
with parliamentary elections set to begin on november 28 , the military council wanted to secure its position in the transitional process and threw a wrench in the form of a draft of supra - constitutional principles that , if it were to be agreed upon by the major political forces , would grant the military council a special status in the new political process			1
it would make the council sovereign above all other state institutions , including the parliament			0
the proposed principles would prevent civilian control or overseeing powers over any of the military 's affairs , grant the military veto powers over the laws and strip the elected parliament of some of its authority			1
the document revealed the military council 's insecurity about the results of the coming elections and the fear that @entity96 might win a majority			2
it also engendered a deep state of polarization among the country 's political forces			0
many liberals and secularists supported the document , while @entity96 parties and youth movements rejected it and organized a massive demonstration friday under the name " the friday of @entity110			0
" several youth and grass - roots movements joined the demonstrations and continued with sit - ins , insisting on a specific timeframe for transitioning authority			0
the security forces brutally cracked down on the protesters , igniting further clashes over the past few days			1
to many protesters , what @entity38 is witnessing is " phase two " of the january revolution			1
one can not ignore the striking similarities between the two phases , particularly the snail - paced responses of the military council and @entity7 and the unjustifiable use of force against unarmed civilians			0
i was in @entity3 on saturday when army soldiers clamped down on thousands of peaceful protesters , killing two in their initial thrust and savagely beating many of them			0
this excessive use of force was a major factor contributing to the fall of @entity7			0
the military council also repeats another fatal mistake by responding too late with too little , leading protesters to raise the ceiling of their demands			1
what started as protests calling for protecting democracy and a timetable for transferring power under the management of the military council has become firm demands for ending the rule of the council and the military generals			1
despite this revolutionary situation , and perhaps because of it , @entity38 has great hopes in transitioning to democracy			1
several steps need to be taken			0
the military council needs to bring to justice those responsible for the death and injury of peaceful protesters , including the immediate dismissal of the minister of interior and his aides			2
a new national salvation government has to be formed of credible public figures to manage the transitional process -- writing a new constitution , restoring order and reviving the country 's economy			0
finally , sticking to a clear road map that allows timely legislative elections to be held under the immediate supervision of the newly formed government , followed by presidential elections , would position @entity38 on a stable path toward democratic transition			1
the military council might try to exploit this precarious situation to impose martial law and postpone or even cancel the parliamentary elections			0
this will prove counterproductive and , in fact , disastrous because @entity38 will then have nothing to lose and will continue with their revolution to end military rule and earn their democracy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			2
