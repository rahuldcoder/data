-- @entity1 knew there was only one way to give his supercharged , alcohol - injected @entity7 - engined hot rod more power : put a jet engine in the trunk			1
" it started as a hobby and turned into a monster , " said @entity1 , the motor madman behind what might be the wildest 1939 @entity13 ever built			1
he 's an inventor and defense department contractor , and the idea of goosing the @entity13 's ability to turn heads and shred tires came when he bought a used gas turbine engine			2
" i got hooked on the simplicity and power that this thing produced , and i decided one day i want to put it in a car			2
" luckily for us , he did			0
the @entity29 -- @entity1 has copyrighted the name -- fires up this weekend at the @entity31 , and @entity1 plans to attempt a land speed record in the near future			1
in the meantime , he 's tooling around @entity35 , @entity36 , in what he says is the ultimate sleeper when the jet engine 's tucked away in the trunk			1
most people say " @entity46 car " and assume he 's got the obligatory small - block @entity43 engine under the hood			1
" i can drive it up to the store and get a gallon of milk if i want to , " he told @entity47			0
the car is an amalgamation of the @entity53 , with a @entity55 engine , @entity43 drivetrain and @entity13 body			1
@entity1 says the jet engine was probably used as an @entity59 and weighs 110 pounds			1
he claims the car is street legal so long as the jet stays stowed			2
he fires it up from time to time to show off , and he plans to run it flat - out at the @entity64			1
" we want to be the fastest street legal car in the world , " he said			2
he 's got some intense competition			0
the @entity69 tops out at 253 mph and the @entity70 does 255			0
and then there 's @entity72 , that crazy @entity73 that does zero to 60 in under a second			0
record , schmecord -- we just want to see the video			0
" i 'm more than certain the car will go over 300 , " @entity1 said			1
" we 've still got a ways to go [ before @entity64 ] , but not a long way			2
we 'll have to experiment in some wind tunnels and end up with a spoiler on the back to keep the front end on the ground			0
" sadly , @entity1 wo n't be behind the wheel during the car 's test run			1
" i turned 61 last sunday			0
i just do n't think i 'm going to be able to handle it [ without ] the reflexes i had 20 or 30 years ago , " he said			0
" i know several people who would be more than interested			0
" so do we , and we even suggested @entity1 give the job to fellow jet - junkie @entity93			1
after jumping from a plane with a pulse jet strapped to his chest , we suspect @entity93 would welcome the opportunity to stay on the ground			0
