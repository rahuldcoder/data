-- @entity2 's new superyacht hotel is so enormous that when it first arrived in the city , authorities had to lower the water level by five meters just to fit it under a bridge			1
they even took the mast off the whopping vessel so it could squeeze underneath a motorway , with a gasp - inducing five centimeters to spare			2
the mast has now been reattached -- not that this five - storey floating hotel is going anywhere soon -- it does n't even have an engine			1
" it took two weeks to tow it here from @entity23 , " explains @entity16 , @entity18 events and sales manager , during a tour of the 102 - meter - long boat			1
" to install an engine would have cost another Â £ 25 million ( $ 44 million ) , so it was built without one on purpose			2
" float your boat the swanky superyacht now sits on the banks of east @entity2 's @entity30 , and come late august it hopes to open its 136 rooms to the public , costing between $ 300 and $ 1,600 per night			1
originally floating in conjunction with a luxury spa hotel in @entity23 , the vessel was given a refurbishment and tugged to the @entity38 -- at a total cost of $ 67 million			1
" you can not refer to these rooms as simply cabins , " says @entity16 , opening the door to one of the top - of - the - range executive suites , featuring its own sauna and a balcony big enough for 20 people			2
" not everybody can afford to go cruising on a superyacht , so this is a way of giving them a taste of how it could be			0
" stepping inside the plush lobby i 'm greeted with a golden staircase , the twinkling light from the water outside reflected on its buffered surface			0
" a lot of people say it reminds them of the @entity57 , " says @entity16			0
" we 've had quite a few requests from clients for titanic - themed events , " she adds , without a hint of irony			0
space race in a place with some of the most expensive property prices in the world , the @entity70 has turned its gaze to @entity2 's many waterways -- and it 's not the first @entity77 city in the company 's sights			1
the company opened its $ 200 million @entity82 hotel earlier this year , moored in the tiny territory located off the southern tip of @entity85			1
there are also plans for another five - star ship in @entity89			1
" i think it is definitely the future of design , because there are so many cities with large marinas and rivers that could be used as well , " said @entity16			0
" you can see it especially in central @entity2 , where we are running out of space in terms of building new hotels			2
" the @entity2 berth has been leased for the next 15 years , with views of looming skyscrapers , and the low roar of airplanes from nearby @entity107 overhead			2
step out onto the decking and it almost feels as though the planes are about to land right on board , and @entity112 is quick to point out the double - glazed windows render it silent inside			0
the hotel itself is attached to the land by two huge supporting arms , and connected to the electricity and sewerage mains			0
" you can not feel any movement , maybe eight millimeters , but it 's impossible to feel seasick , " says @entity16 , as we take in the view from the third - storey deck , the summer glare bouncing off the water			1
energized @entity128 ? decades ago , this part of @entity2 was a very different place			1
what was once one of the busiest ports in the world had become a deserted wasteland by 1980			0
so much so that the grim image of a ruined city was the perfect setting for @entity141 's 1987 @entity140 war film " @entity142			0
" it was n't until the @entity144 redeveloped the site towards the end of the decade -- including the financial hub of @entity149 -- that the area was reborn			0
" this superyacht hotel creates a new set of symbols for the area -- in terms of the wealth it represents , it 's a huge change , " said @entity151 , senior curator at the @entity152			1
" now it 's all about service and luxury , so it 's a very different idea of the @entity164			0
much like @entity2 itself has moved from an industry economy to a service - based economy			2
" gazing across the skyline from the sunlit deck of the multimillion - dollar superyacht hotel , the @entity128 of old feels very far away indeed			1
