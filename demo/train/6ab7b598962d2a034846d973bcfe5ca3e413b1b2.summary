-- could a floating dome that can house up to 10,000 people be a model for future living ? @entity6 architect @entity5 thinks so -- and his prototype design , called " @entity8 , " bears more than a passing resemblance to the classic children 's toy , the @entity12			1
@entity5 believes his @entity13 , designed to be constructed from timber , steel and high - strength @entity17 plastic , could be adapted for all kinds of environments and put to a number of different uses , including emergency housing -- its prefabricated structure should allow it to be constructed quickly -- and hotels			1
he 's even suggested a variation with a honeycomb - style hull that can float			2
after completing a masters degree looking at non-polluting settlements , @entity5 decided to pursue that theme with his architecture firm @entity30 and design a modern building that would be in harmony with the environment			1
he says that he took a holistic approach to the problems of providing power to @entity8 , working with colleague @entity37 on energy solutions to keep it in balance with the environment			0
a wind power generator that runs through the center of the building would provide power while the outer surface would be covered with transparent solar panels			1
if the @entity13 was built on water , as @entity5 suggests , he says it could also utilize thermal water energy			1
" the form of a dome promotes the formation of turbulences of air , strengthening the work of wind generators , " wrote @entity5 in an email to @entity0			0
" inside the building , the dome form promotes accumulation of warm air in the top part of a building , " he continued			0
" this heat will be transformed to other kinds of energy and collects also in thermal accumulators			0
" while still on the drawing board , @entity5 believes @entity8 could be used for many purposes from apartments to offices and hotels , and be built on different scales to house between 50 and 10,000 people			0
the way in which the @entity13 could be assembled from ready - made structures would reduce the cost of construction , suggests @entity5 , who estimates that it would be comparable to the cost of energy - efficient " green " buildings			2
" lightweight materials , such as coating film , light design of the foundation , no insulation due to the presence of the buffer zone , reduce the weight structures , which would lead to cheaper construction , " he said .			0

the @entity13 is designed to be a *multi-use* environmentally *friendly* building
@entity6 architect believes it would be a building in balance with *nature*
uses transparent solar cells on outer surface and central wind generator
one version of design could float on water
