-- now , this just may be the best entertainment news of the summer			2
it has nothing to do with movie blockbusters			2
they 're coming , as they always do when the weather gets warm : the mass - produced , mind - deadening barrage of predictable sequels , computer - generated explosions and space battles , dreary comedies about groups of wacky buddies , and high - decibel car chase after high - decibel car chase			2
which is what makes what happened on a recent saturday afternoon in @entity21 , @entity22 , population 2,897 , so delightful			2
a one - day musical theater production was presented that had taken three months to write , rehearse and produce			1
it took place along an eight - mile stretch of the @entity29			1
more than 200 people attended			2
and that entire audience was in canoes			1
for three hours , they paddled from scene to scene			2
" the river was the real star of the show , " said @entity36 , 33 , of @entity37 , @entity22 , who wrote the play and the music for it , and who co-directed it with his producing partner , @entity41 , 29			1
he said that their intention was to honor and salute the concept of community and place : to provide for their audience an afternoon of entertainment that they could n't possibly find anywhere else			1
in dreaming up the idea and getting it done -- putting the audience in those canoes , and having them paddle to each of the six scenes in the play along the eight miles of water -- @entity36 and @entity41 may have displayed more sheer ingenuity and grin - inducing creativity than you 'll find in any dozen movie - multiplex blockbusters in the months ahead			1
the play was called " with the @entity71 , " and it told the story of how three western @entity29 communities , in the late 1800s , competed to become the county seat			1
the @entity29 , though , was without question the leading character , " with its slow meanders and brutally carved banks , with its fish jumping , turtles sunbathing , eagles soaring , and pelicans taxiing , " in @entity36 's words			1
there was a cast of 34 , all volunteer amateur actors , and a crew of nearly 100			0
the scenes took place in six locales along the river ranging from an island to a small bluff overlooking the water ; from a campground on the water 's edge to a beautiful meadow			1
the audience would paddle up in their canoes ( there were 18 10 - person canoes , plus smaller canoes that just sort of tagged along ) ; the audience would sit right there in those canoes and watch the actors play the scene on the shore			1
then some of the actors would race ahead in cars to the next location so that they would arrive before the canoes did			0
" for me , this was 100 % about the celebration of community , " @entity41 told me			2
" we keep being told that , all over the country , the traditional sense of community is being fragmented , is disappearing			1
that 's why it felt so good to put such a tremendous amount of work into something so ephemeral			2
something magical that is there for one day only			0
" she and @entity36 are new at this ; they have formed a theater company in @entity37 they call @entity134 , in the hopes of presenting community - specific shows like this around the nation			1
they received some financial underwriting for the @entity21 endeavor from @entity22 organizations devoted to the betterment of life along the river , but on the subject of making enough money doing this to support themselves , " we 're still kind of trying to figure that out , " @entity36 said with a laugh			2
like the rest of us , @entity36 has sat in movie theaters and witnessed that annoying glow as people in row after row check their cellphone screens for messages even while the film is playing			0
he said one of the nicest parts of the @entity165 ( that 's what he and @entity41 called it ) afternoon was that " i did n't see anyone yakking in their canoes -- i did n't see them on the phone			0
they seemed like they did n't want to be anywhere else in the world than where they were at that moment			0
" no professional theater critics attended the production , but outdoors writer @entity182 of the @entity183 in nearby @entity184 , @entity22 , watched the entire show from a canoe			1
i asked him what he thought , both of the day and of the performance			0
" it was great , " he said			0
" it really did work			0
" there was something i kept thinking about as i spoke with @entity36 and @entity41 , and i hoped they would n't be offended if i brought it up , because i meant it as a compliment			0
one of my favorite movies is " @entity204 , " @entity202 's sardonic yet ultimately hopeful 1997 comedy about the fictional small town of @entity204 , @entity205 , and its against - all - odds attempt to put on a one - day musical for the town 's 150th birthday			1
what happened in @entity21 felt a little like guffman - with - paddles , and i wanted to know if that had occurred to @entity213 and @entity41			0
" ' @entity214 ' is my battle cry , " @entity41 said			0
" not the comical elements in it , but the sweetness			0
" the importance of making the effort			0
the sense of sincerity , of caring for a community			1
" that 's what fuels me			0
getting people excited about where they 're from			0
reminding them of why it matters			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			1

@entity233 : a theater troupe put on a play at various spots along 8 miles of @entity29
he says audience travels to scenes by canoe , pulls up to bank to watch from the river
he says creators of play want to deliver a sense of place to audiences
@entity233 : like " @entity204 , " play celebrates community sweetly , sincerely
