-- every morning , while i open granola bars and pass them to my children in the back seat , i feel a familiar pang of guilt reminding me that a good mother would have made them scrambled eggs and toast			1
a good mother would have the time and the money to structure their day in a way that fosters healthy growth and development			1
maybe we would meet a friend for playtime at the museum and lunch ? that 's what i would do if i were a good mother			2
sometimes my son wakes up in a pee - soaked bed and i just wipe him down with a wet wipe because giving him a shower will take five precious minutes i just do n't have			1
there are other shortcuts i 've taken in the interest of time : sending my daughter to school in my socks because she does n't have any that are clean ; digging a toy out from under the seat of the car for show - and - tell because i forgot to pack one			1
the same script plays in my head every morning : " it 's just temporary			2
we just need to get through this week , this month , the summer , this school year , " and then : " they wo n't wait for you			2
their childhood is now and they are not getting what they need			2
you are n't giving them what they need			2
they need you , and you 're not there			2
" i always wanted to be a stay - at - home mom , and most of what i know about parenting and young children i learned in college , where i earned a bachelor 's degree in human development			1
working full - time while my kids burned the hours in a day care was on my list of things that " i will never do			1
" i had worked in day care centers			0
i have seen the runny noses and tired eyes of a kid getting picked up from day care after a nine - hour day			1
" why have kids if you do n't want to raise them ? " i often judgmentally wondered to myself about those parents			1
" ca n't you see how much they need you ? " i had other " never will dos " and " will dos " rigidly etched onto my brain -- a guide i 'd created to build the perfect childhood for my babies			0
for the most part , i was able to stick to the plan for the first couple of years			1
aside from being a little too broke in the very beginning to afford an suv or a @entity89 membership , my early mommy years were just as i hoped they would be			1
soon , my husband made more money and mommy life got even better			0
my kids went to part - time preschool for a few hours in the morning and spent the afternoons riding their trikes in the street of a nice quiet neighborhood filled with kids and other stay - at - home moms			1
they helped me shop for organic groceries that i would bring home to make a dinner from scratch			1
i taught them to swim in our pool , taught my daughter to read and my son to count			0
my mommy life was perfect			0
there were definitely tantrums and messes , but i was very happy with most of the pieces of my life			0
in all this perfection , i failed to notice that for my ( then ) husband , things were n't so perfect			0
when our babies were 2 and 4 , he decided he 'd had enough			1
he asked for a divorce and moved into an apartment in the city			0
suddenly i found myself jobless and alone with two small children in a big , beautiful house with a " @entity129 " sign in the front yard			0
their father is still present in their lives , but this was not how things were supposed to go			0
the years that followed were a blur of exhaustion , anxiety and guilt			1
i moved those children three times in two years			1
slowly , i was building a career that would give us pieces of our lives back , but it was a hard time for all of us			1
tears would run down my cheeks each time i watched my daughter bravely march into a new school and again at the end of the day when my son would squeal and run to me after a nine - hour stretch at day care			1
their resilience was absolutely dumbfounding			0
they adapted to each change with a strength that i will never fully understand			0
play dates with neighborhood friends were few and far between			0
our dinners now were mostly from the drive - through in the car on the way home , just in time to get in bed only to start all over again in the morning			1
there were days i gave a dose of @entity172 and crossed my fingers that the tail end of a fever would n't come back at school			0
it was certainly a far cry from homemade chicken noodle soup , ice cream , and a movie marathon that the same fever would have required just the year before			0
our journey has not ended yet , but now that we 've settled , the ride is less bumpy			1
we have lived in the same house for two years			2
we have a network of friends and we 're back in our old neighborhood			0
my kids have a lot of people who love and care for them			2
i finally earn enough money to live in a nice neighborhood and send my kids to good schools			1
we have a routine and we all feel like we 're on solid ground			0
my house feels like a happy home			2
but the guilt keeps coming because this is ground i never wanted them to stand on			2
i wanted them to have a daddy who comes home and wrestles with them or takes them out for doughnuts to give their mommy a break			2
i wanted them to walk home from school to find their mom in the house and snacks on the counter			1
i wanted to read to the class on friday afternoons and volunteer to host girl scout meetings			0
i did n't want to have my face buried in my @entity219 while pretending to watch " @entity220 : friendship is @entity222 " with my daughter			0
i did n't want be a stranger to the other moms at school , and i did n't want to throw chicken nuggets at them when i just did n't have it in me to make dinner			0
what i do n't yet know is whether i am mourning my loss or theirs			0
i know i have to make peace with my choices , with our fate and with the childhood that they will experience , but i 'm not there yet			0
