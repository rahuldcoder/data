this was the miracle of @entity2			1
in 1999 , it was the @entity4 who stunned the @entity7 team as they overhauled a four - point deficit to win at @entity9			1
on sunday , @entity7 inflicted an identical comeback on @entity11 's @entity4 as @entity12 held his nerve to hole the most dramatic of putts and ensure a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 point victory for @entity17 's team			1
playing in the blue and white outfits made famous by the legendary @entity20 , @entity7 's players produced a performance that the late @entity22 would have been proud of despite trailing 10 - 6 heading into the final day in @entity23			1
" it 's very hard to describe my emotions , " @entity7 captain @entity17 told reporters			1
" when i saw we had a chance this afternoon coming down the stretch , i was very emotional , i started thinking about the possibility of winning			0
" the boys have been unbelievable			0
i started thinking about my friend @entity20 and this one is for him			0
" i have never experienced anything like this			0
this event is so special			0
" while the @entity4 had dominated the first two days of the competition , they simply had no answer to a @entity7 team determined to honor @entity20 ' memory			2
@entity4 close in on @entity42 glory despite late @entity44 heroics @entity17 's players struggled to keep up with the @entity4 in the fourballs and the foursomes , but they raced out of the traps from the very first tee shot of the singles matches			1
led by @entity51 , who comprehensively saw off @entity52 in the opening game , @entity7 rode on the crest of a wave with @entity56 @entity44 , who won four of his matches , at the center of the charge			1
@entity42 revolutionaries : @entity20 and @entity61 @entity44 , a wildcard pick by captain @entity17 , justified his selection as he saw off @entity66 champion @entity67 2 & 1			2
" @entity61 said to us at the start of the week , @entity42 is what memories and dreams are made of , and he 's been awesome , " explained an emotional @entity44			1
" and last night in that team room was buzzing			0
we were n't four down			0
we just knew we had a chance and do you know what ? this is history right here			0
" i 'm going to enjoy it , with the best team i 've ever seen , and the best captain i 've ever seen , and everyone else , because this right here is special			0
" @entity89 's @entity88 , playing in the @entity42 for the first time since @entity9 13 years ago , claimed @entity7 's second point of the day , thrashing @entity93 playoff winner @entity91 5 & 3			1
with the momentum firmly behind @entity7 , world no. 1 @entity94 edged out impressive rookie @entity96 2 & 1 before @entity44 brought @entity7 level			1
big - hitter @entity98 got the first point of the day for the @entity4 following a 3 & 2 win over the equally powerful @entity101 of @entity102			2
while that victory was met with loud cheers , the joy was short lived as @entity56 's @entity106 showed nerves of steel over the final three holes to see off four - time major winner @entity110			2
@entity111 was trailing going into the 17th , but holed a stunning putt to level before sneaking beyond @entity110 at the last for a 2 up victory			1
the @entity4 moved ahead once again to lead 12 - 11 following @entity116 's 2 & 1 win over northern irishman @entity117 , who struggled for form throughout			2
but @entity7 refused to give up and former world no. 1 @entity119 holed his putt on the 16th hole to secure a 3 & 2 win over @entity123 and round off a difficult week on a high note			1
there was further drama as experienced @entity4 @entity127 lost out to @entity129 @entity42 veteran @entity128			2
@entity127 thought he had won the match on the 16th and began to celebrate as his ball circled the lip of the cup -- only to agonizingly roll out			0
@entity134 backs @entity94 to roar over @entity135 the consistent @entity136 , a winner of three points from four matches , saw off @entity139 to make it 13 - 13 as the tension increased			1
with two matches remaining on the course both teams sensed victory but it was @entity7 which held its nerve			1
@entity147 's @entity12 took a one - shot lead on the 17th and then produced the defining moment of the 39th @entity42 -- holing the crucial putt on the last to defeat @entity152 and ensure the @entity4 could not reach the winning target of 14 1/2 points			1
that left @entity7 on 14 points and @entity158 @entity157 secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14 - time major winner @entity135			1
" they played very , very well , " said @entity4 captain @entity163 " they holed putts when they had to			0
we never got that big chip in or that big shot , maybe it just was n't our week			0
" the @entity7 played with class and i congratulate them			2
we never took this for granted			0
we had a lot of guys who got beat today , i do n't know if they played badly but they did n't win			0
" there 's probably a lot i 'd change now we did n't win			0
it 'll be disappointing when we think about how well we played and did n't win			0
it 's not good for us , but it 's good for golf this @entity42			2
