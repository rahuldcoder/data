-- " @entity1 " revealed its top 10 last night , but after the lights dimmed on the live show , the new crop of contestants and the judges had a chance to speak to the press about the big night and preview the competition to come			1
so what did we learn ? here are some highlights : 1			2
@entity13 thinks @entity14 could upset the @entity15 of the girl since the early audition rounds , producers and judges have said the girls have a strong chance of breaking the male - winner streak			1
but while @entity13 notes the strength of the female lot , he 's not counting out the boys , especially @entity27			1
" there are some really good girls singers , but when you see a guy like @entity32 [ @entity33 ] or even more so @entity14 and the way he connects with an audience — he comes out and sings and they go crazy			1
they love him and the votes have really reflected that , " @entity13 told reporters			2
so could @entity27 be the one to upset what 's been referred to by some as the @entity15 ? " he certainly could be , " says @entity13			1
" but i love that there 's a few in here who could do that if they get the right song and the stars line up			1
i hate that [ that 's the case ] for them			1
it 's like — you might be the best football team ever , but if you do n't have the game on @entity56 day that you need , you do n't win			1
but you could [ have ] won the day before if you 'd played the day before			2
this show is like that			1
" meanwhile , @entity27 admits that his " @entity60 " performance may have not been his best showing : " yeah , i was a hot mess with my song tonight			2
i did n't get a chance to rehearse it			1
therefore , i walked on stage and found out i have to sing , i was like , ' @entity66 ! uh-oh			2
' so from now on , i just want to get comfortable with performing			0
" ' @entity1 ' : here 's your @entity68 2			1
that reveal was awkward for the contestants , too			1
@entity73 recapper @entity72 was n't a fan of the awkwardly formatted top 10 reveal show , saying it lacked suspense and tension for the home audience			1
but backstage , the biggest problem was an overload of emotions			0
" i think that was the ugliest walk i 've ever made because i was in the middle of crying and laughing and just thinking of what 's going on back home right now , " @entity83 joked			1
" but it was great			0
" @entity90 - speaking singer @entity89 also admitted to being a little overwhelmed after the big moment			1
" i got a little woozy , and @entity93 had to shake me , ' @entity89 , @entity89 , you have to go on stage			0
' and the moment the doors open on stage , i just walked out , and i had to put my face in my hands			0
i just could n't look			0
it was unbelievable that all those people were clapping for me because they voted for me , " he said			0
" it was just confirmation of , ' @entity89 , you 're here to sing			0
you were born to sing			0
we need you to do this			0
' so it was like , ' alright			0
i have to do it now			0
a change will do you good speaking of @entity112 , who has made it a point to show off his @entity90 skills during his performances thus far , he 's going to skip the @entity90 twist next week in an effort to keep his offerings fresh			1
" i 'm not going to make it predictable ; i want to catch them by surprise			0
if you make it predictable , you will get voted off			0
but i definitely think there will be more coming , just not right now			0
we 're going to take a break , " he said			0
" i might [ eventually ] do a whole @entity90 song , too , but i do n't know yet			1
it 's all up in the air right now			1
" @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 in ' @entity135 ' 4			0
even contestants fear the @entity137 @entity139 's side eyes are n't the only scary thing about this season of @entity1			1
as contestants prepare to head into the more intense rounds of competition , @entity139 's razor - sharp tongue and bluntness have some of them sweating			1
" she 's always so honest — but it 's so necessary , " @entity33 told us , after confessing @entity139 was the judge whose critiques he 's most fearing			1
" i can always count on her when it comes to honesty			0
" country singer @entity154 echoed the statement , saying despite being @entity139 's beloved " @entity156 , " she does n't consider herself safe			1
" even though i know @entity137 loves me , i always know that she 's looking for that certain thing that makes her love me			2
so when she does n't see it , i know she 's going to bring it up and she 's going to say , ' what happened ? i did n't see what i wanted to see , ' " said @entity161			2
" she 's also so unpredictable			2
i never know what she 's going to do			2
so , yeah , i 'm probably most apprehensive about her			0
. to @entity165 while we 're talking about @entity161 , it 's worth bringing up that this blond country singer is well aware of the comparisons being drawn to that other blonde country singer from @entity1 , and while flattering , she said she has no plans to cover a @entity173 song			2
" i 'm trying to stay as far away from the @entity173 songs as i can because @entity165 is incredible , " she said			0
" i do n't want to be compared to @entity165 — but of course i 'm going to be because i 'm blonde and country			0
but our styles are so different , and that 's the good thing about it			2
@entity180 has room for another blonde			0
" one blonde singer 's music she definitely wants a chance to tackle , however ? " i hope to perform a @entity188 song at some point , " she said			1
