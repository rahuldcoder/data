-- a vintage car collection , exotic birds and a gaudy palace ; former @entity5 president @entity4 was seemingly living the high life even as his country 's economy stalled			1
now , as economic growth goes into reverse , @entity5 is in desperate need of financial help			1
the question is whether the country 's lawmakers will do what they must to persuade the world that there wo n't be a repeat of @entity4 's gaudy lifestyle			1
last month , anti-corruption protesters in @entity5 surrounded the @entity23 parliament building waving gold - painted loaves of bread			1
the demonstration was aimed at persuading lawmakers to pass strong anti-corruption legislation that would prohibit political leaders like @entity4 from living gilded lifestyles funded by state coffers			1
sadly , lawmakers balked , and the legislation failed by eight votes as too many members of parliament abstained			2
the vote was a significant setback to president @entity40 , who had promised to clean up corruption in his presidential campaign			0
but more importantly , the vote was a blow against efforts to revive @entity5 's economy as the legislation is a prerequisite to securing the next vital tranche of the $ 17 billion multilateral loan package from the @entity50 , the @entity51 and the @entity52			1
the cash is urgently needed if @entity5 is to shore up both its economy and its borders			1
true , a ceasefire has brought with it a lull in the fighting between government forces and @entity61 rebels			0
but clashes have continued even as @entity63 continues to turn the screws with its own set of sanctions			0
the problem for @entity5 is that @entity4 's lifestyle -- allegedly funded through sweetheart deals and shady companies -- has left the international community wary of handing money over to the government without some guarantee that the rule of law will apply to those handling the funds			1
after all , @entity5 ranked 144th out of 177 countries in the 2013 @entity79 , with a score that indicated rampant corruption			1
the failure of last month 's vote leaves @entity40 with two more chances before a parliamentary election later this month to push through the required legislation -- on october 7 and october 14			2
the laws being tabled are a strong set of regulations that organizations including @entity5 have helped draft ( and indeed have been advocating for years ) , including the creation of a dedicated @entity93 with investigatory powers to centralize what is now dealt with by an ad hoc group of offices that fail to share information and work together			2
in addition , the proposals include a time - bound , three - year @entity101 that sets goals for implementing laws , as well as a law that would make it possible to try those suspected of corruption even if they are not in @entity5			1
( the absence of such legislation is thwarting the prosecution and the return of assets allegedly stolen by @entity4 , who has fled to @entity63			0
) so what is stopping lawmakers getting behind these common sense rules ? one sticking point likely scaring politicians is that from the new parliament onward there would be mandatory public registries of lawmakers ' assets , so - called asset declarations , and a public list of any potential conflicts of interests			0
asset declarations , particularly if they are monitored by civil society , can help raise a red flag if politicians are living beyond their means : a tried and tested tool in the fight against corruption that is particularly effective if you can compare year - on - year wealth accumulation			2
it 's perhaps no wonder , then , that a parliament filled with politicians who profited from @entity4 's term in office would not be happy with these new laws , and although @entity40 thought he had amassed the votes to get them passed in september , enough abstained to scupper his plans			0
but there is still some cause for optimism			0
with parliamentary elections just three weeks away , many of those former members of @entity4 's party ( the @entity150 ) who have not fled have allied themselves with other parties to keep their seats , and can be expected to try to distance themselves from the corruption that toppled the government			2
@entity40 must therefore clearly tie the future economic success of a @entity158 to the electoral fortunes of the candidates			0
if they vote against the legislation this week , international support may wane , the development loans could be delayed and economic recovery stall			0
@entity40 must clearly explain this likely chain of events to the public so politicians are convinced that if they are seen as opposing the fight against corruption , they will not attract voters -- voters who have taken to the streets to voice their displeasure over the issue			0
the map of @entity177 politics is about to be redrawn			0
the question is whether lawmakers will seize this opportunity to pass a strong set of anti-corruption laws that will show parliament is committed to ruling the country for the people , not for themselves			1
the country 's future depends on it .			0
