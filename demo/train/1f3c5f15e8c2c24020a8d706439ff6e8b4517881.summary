while veterans in recent years were dying as they waited for care at @entity0 hospitals , the @entity0 has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on controversial projects across the country , according to government reports and members of @entity10			1
critics say budget overruns and construction delays on several projects are burning money that could have been used to help more veterans access timely health care , with one lawmaker even comparing the elaborate projects to the @entity20			1
for example , a massive construction project near @entity22 mired with problems ran hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and ended up in court over design and contract issues , according to court documents			2
the joint venture building the medical center near @entity22 , @entity32 , estimated the total project would cost more than $ 1 billion -- almost double the contractual estimate of $ 583 million			1
@entity32 took the matter to court , saying the @entity0 never provided a design for the medical center that could be built for its budget			1
the court sided with the builder , allowing @entity32 to walk away from the project earlier this month			0
@entity32 and the @entity0 subsequently reached an agreement to resume construction			2
judges with the @entity43 said the total cost of the medical center remains unknown but will be " significantly in excess " of the @entity0 's original budget			1
various forms of @entity0 mismanagement and changes in the medical center 's design contributed to cost overruns and construction delays , according to court documents			1
during court proceedings , private contractors criticized the @entity0 for including expensive , non-health - related projects within the medical center 's design , such as an estimated $ 82.6 million , three - story glass concourse that would connect different parts of the facility , which included a " zigzag " wall to block the sun. " all of this was aesthetics , " @entity66 , a private construction manager on the project , said at a court hearing in may			1
" nobody was interested in cleaning up the aesthetics so that we could improve or add to the patient care			0
" the @entity0 and contractor @entity32 resumed construction on the medical center monday , but only after the @entity0 paid the contractor $ 157 million in owed costs			1
" this is n't about building a medical center , but about building a facility where @entity0 can provide high - quality health care to the more than 390,000 @entity86 veterans who have served our nation , " @entity0 deputy secretary @entity81 said last week			1
@entity90 official : ' conflicting direction ' caused cost overruns a 2013 report by the @entity90 found that delays and mismanagement contributed to a total cost increase of $ 1.5 billion at @entity0 construction projects in @entity22 , @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			1
the report said that an average construction delay of 35 months at each project contributed to the cost increases , such as in @entity98 , where construction was delayed more than six years			1
those delays were blamed on changes in local veterans ' needs and shifting @entity0 policies , according to the @entity90			2
@entity111 , the @entity90 director of infrastructure issues at the time of the investigation , told @entity1 " conflicting direction " from the @entity0 has repeatedly caused cost overruns on different projects			1
as an example , @entity118 said va managers have told contractors to wait for equipment before designing specific hospital rooms , but @entity0 's central office or other va managers have ordered contractors to proceed with designs anyway			2
these contradictions have caused unnecessary work and extra costs , she said			0
rep. @entity132 , @entity86 , whose district includes the va project near @entity22 , said the agency should be stripped of its authority to oversee major construction projects			1
" this is money that is not going to the care of veterans , " @entity140 , himself a veteran , told @entity1 , adding that some of these medical centers are given unnecessarily elaborate designs , like " @entity144			2
" @entity140 said the construction problems are deeply rooted in the @entity0 's culture , since these projects have had consistent delays and cost overruns despite different @entity0 managers overseeing construction on different sites			1
at a hearing before the @entity157 in april , a top @entity0 construction official , @entity158 , admitted there have been challenges but said the @entity0 has improved its construction process by better defining costs , adding staff and using an online tool to track design changes , along with other reforms			0
" @entity0 is moving toward its goal of improving and streamlining our processes to increase access to our veterans and their families , " @entity158 said in his testimony			0
the @entity90 report additionally found in 2014 that the rent the @entity0 paid for 31 leased outpatient facilities increased by a total of $ 34.5 million primarily due to @entity0 delays and project changes , among other issues			2
the va will have to pay these extra costs annually for each of the properties ' 20 - year leases , according to the @entity90 's report			0
additionally , the @entity0 's @entity186 found the @entity0 could inappropriately handle $ 795 million worth of service contracts in the next five years if its contract management processes do not change , according to a report released this year			2
wind turbine debacle one of the @entity0 's green energy initiatives has also been a source of spending controversy			0
the @entity0 hired the firm @entity194 to build an energy - saving wind turbine in 2009 at the @entity196 in @entity197 , @entity198 -- for a price of $ 2.3 million			0
the project was completed in 2011 , but it was shut down the same year due to oil leaks , and although a litany of repairs was ordered , a variety of technical issues caused the turbine to sit idle for years			0
in october of this year , the @entity0 terminated its contract with @entity194 , the company overseeing the turbine , and said it will seek to recover the wasted costs			0
a 2014 report released by sen. @entity212 , @entity213 , argues the @entity0 has misused or mismanaged billions of dollars on initiatives ranging from lavish employee trips and conferences to faulty it systems and call centers that handle just a few calls a day , among other programs			0
some of the specific expenses @entity212 highlighted as wasteful include $ 489 million spent on " office makeovers " in less than five years , $ 5 million spent on unused computer software between 2006 and 2011 , and even $ 50,000 spent on the production of a parody of the movie " @entity227			0
" @entity212 's report also criticized the @entity0 for maintaining and renovating unused buildings , such as a historic monkey house on the property of the va medical center in @entity233 , @entity234			1
" even a small amount of waste in the way @entity0 has contracted for each facility could easily mean over a billion dollars in taxpayer dollars lost that could have paid for veterans ' essential medical care , " @entity212 's report said			1
congressman : management is the problem , not money the @entity0 's budget has grown from about $ 114 billion in 2010 to about $ 154 billion in 2014 , but a @entity1 investigation found veterans were dying while waiting for care despite this increase in funding			1
a @entity0 internal audit this year found extreme delays in patient care and scheduling issues were systemic throughout the department			2
@entity0 secretary @entity257 resigned as a result			0
rep. @entity259 , @entity260 , chairman of the @entity261 , told @entity1 delays in care at @entity0 hospitals can not be attributed to lack of money since @entity0 has left hundreds of millions in health care funding unspent each fiscal year since 2010			2
" @entity0 does n't have a money problem , it has a management problem , " @entity259 said , explaining that @entity10 has repeatedly passed legislation to increase @entity0 resources , yet problems have persisted			0
in august , president @entity272 signed into law a bill that provided the @entity0 with an additional $ 16 billion to hire more @entity0 doctors and nurses , open mobile clinics and enable more veterans to obtain private medical care			1
a @entity0 audit released in december showed more than 13,000 appointments still had wait times longer than 120 days			0
secretary @entity283 , who began leading the @entity0 this summer , has vowed to reform the agency and uphold patient care as its top priority			0
" i 'm convinced that our comprehensive reforms will enable us to better meet the needs of our veterans because we will be looking at everything we do through their eyes			0
we owe them nothing less , " @entity283 said in a november press release .			0

@entity0 critics say project cost overruns and construction delays are burning money
@entity22 medical center 's estimated cost nearly doubled , to more than $ 1 billion
delays averaging nearly 3 years at 4 sites contributed to $ 1.5 billion in cost increases
