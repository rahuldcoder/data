-- @entity2 health officials have issued a warning to anyone who may have been in the vicinity of a particular woman at the end of march : you may have been exposed to measles , a highly contagious and potentially fatal respiratory disease			1
privacy laws prevent them from showing you the woman 's picture or telling you her name , so they 're trying another tack : they 're telling you where she 's been			1
the @entity17 posted where she was virtually every hour of the day between march 26 , when she became contagious , and march 29 , so that you can determine whether you are at risk and possibly need medical attention			0
" i 've seen it happen pretty regularly when it comes to significant infectious disease circumstances , " agency spokesman @entity23 said tuesday when asked whether this was a unique approach to quelling a public health crisis before it starts			2
" what 's unique is the extent of the schedule this person had while ill , " he told @entity0			1
the 20 - something @entity34 woman did n't seem to be slowed a bit by the infectious disease			1
she kept a schedule that would be the envy of any healthy bon vivant			2
on friday , march 28 , for example , after working from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the at the @entity51 ( home of the " world 's best scones " according to its website " ) , she made a stop at @entity41 and spirits before checking into the @entity43 in downtown @entity44 at 7:15 p.m. she then took in the @entity46 concert at @entity47 -- about a 20 - minute walk from the hotel -- until midnight			1
she kept the party going at a place called @entity59 until 3 a.m. before finally heading back to her hotel			0
the next day was spent traipsing around like an energetic tourist : lunch in @entity64 , then south to @entity65 to take in the @entity67 car museum and a visit to a place called the @entity70 before bellying up at @entity71 and eatery in @entity73			0
measles is so highly contagious that you can get it by simply walking into a room where someone with it had been hours before -- which is why her attending the concert is a concern			1
" this was n't a local bar , " @entity23 said			0
" it was a major concert at a major venue			2
" even though most people in @entity2 are vaccinated -- 96 % statewide by 6th grade -- @entity47 holds 15,000 people for concerts , signifying the potential for exposure , given some concertgoers may have been from out of state			2
" it 's a serious illness , " said @entity23			0
" @entity95 has a way of finding those who are not vaccinated			1
" there have been no linked reported cases thus far , according to @entity100			0
" it 's still early			0
" the department says the woman became contagious with measles on march 26 after visiting a local family member with measles linked to an outbreak in @entity108			1
@entity109 , the health authority in @entity108 , confirms 375 cases of measles as of april 8			1
@entity100 would not pinpoint when the woman was diagnosed , only that it occurred between march 29 and april 2 , when the agency posted her schedule online			1
" anyone who was in those locations at the listed times should find out if they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously , " the agency said			2
those who are n't and " develop an illness with fever or unexplained rash should consult a health care professional immediately			0
" as for the patient , @entity100 says that she is recovering			0
@entity0 's @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
