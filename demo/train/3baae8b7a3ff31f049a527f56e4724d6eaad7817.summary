-- @entity1 was looking forward to watching hockey games at the @entity3 with her three kids this year			1
now , she 's scrambling to cancel their plane tickets because @entity7 just does n't seem safe			1
growing security concerns surrounding the @entity9 , she says , made her rethink the family vacation plans she made months ago			1
" we wanted to do it to be a cultural learning experience for the kids , " she says , " and now that 's not worth the risk			1
" it 's a worry many people are weighing as warnings about the possibility of terrorists targeting the @entity7 games grew this week			1
athletes say they 're still eager to compete in the @entity9 , which are less than three weeks away			1
organizers say they 're confident officials have a handle on the situation			0
and @entity30 's leaders say they 've stepped up security around the area in a " @entity33 " that attackers wo n't penetrate			1
but those reassurances have n't stopped serious concerns about safety among spectators , competitors and security analysts			1
@entity42 travel fears after decades of hearing about the @entity3 from afar as her husband helped cover them for a @entity48 - @entity47 television network , @entity1 decided this was the year for the family to fly from @entity51 , to @entity7 and join him			1
she started worrying when she learned about last month 's terrorist attacks in @entity53 , @entity30 , which killed more than 30 people , but she tried to tamp down her concerns			2
a @entity57 travel alert earlier this month convinced her that the situation was serious			2
the wording of the alert , which calls large - scale public events like the @entity3 " an attractive target for terrorists , " and mentions previous attacks in @entity30 was strong enough to make @entity1 decide to back out			1
" it 's an official voice telling you that yes , your fears are right			1
... ok , it 's not just me			2
there 's another voice , a voice with some gravitas saying , ' be careful out there			2
' " and the potential security threats seem to be mounting , @entity1 said			2
" it has n't stopped , " she said			0
" over the past couple of days , it 's continuing			2
" so while news reports surged this week about new threats to the games , a wanted terror suspect on the loose and warships readying to evacuate @entity84 citizens if necessary , @entity1 has been canceling plane tickets			2
taking her kids to @entity7 , she said , is out of the question			1
" we fear not only for their safety , but also the repercussions that it would have if they were in the part of the world that experienced something horrible ... and just the logistics of getting out of there , " she said			2
security concerns like @entity1 's are cited by some as a reason for sluggish @entity3 ticket sales -- though vendors in the @entity84 told @entity0 that demand is " at expected levels " and that last - minute sales will likely surge in @entity30			1
organizers in @entity30 said last week that around 30 % of available tickets still had n't been purchased , the @entity30 @entity108 news agency reported			0
if those seats remain unsold , @entity30 president @entity111 suggested volunteers might fill the remaining spots in the stands			0
' i 'm definitely going to be vigilant ' @entity47 @entity117 said he has no plans to give up his tickets , but he 's worried about security , too			1
he was watching tv with his mother in @entity123 when news broke of last month 's bombing at the @entity53 train station , a transit hub 400 miles way from @entity7			1
" she looked at me and she said , ' you 're not going to @entity7			1
i lost your father , i 'm not losing one of my kids			1
' " but @entity117 said he did n't cancel his trip , despite his mother 's concerns			1
he regularly travels around the world on business trips and knows that there 's no predicting danger			2
" anything can happen on a plane or train or automobile			0
i do n't live by that , " he said			0
" for sure , i 'm worried			2
it 's obviously a concern			0
but you know what , i 'm definitely going to be vigilant , and keep my eyes open around me , and be aware of my surroundings			2
" in the meantime , he 's looking forward to staying on a cruise ship docked alongside the coastal city and picking up his spectator pass so he can take in as many events as he can			0
as part of the stepped up security measures for this year 's games , @entity30 required visitors to provide photos , passport information and ticket numbers in advance to receive the passes			2
that , @entity117 said , shows how serious they are about keeping the @entity9 safe			2
" i 'm probably 95 % excited and nervous , and maybe 5 % scared , " he said			0
" i think once we get there , i think that kind of fear will start to recede			0
i think you really have to hit the ground running and see			0
" coach : athletes must ' try and fight through ' fears @entity175 , who won a gold medal in figure skating in the @entity178 and will be attending this year 's games as a commentator for @entity181 , said she feels safe , despite the warnings			1
" you ca n't take this lightly			0
but at the same time , being at the @entity3 , i have never experienced security that high			1
so hopefully that will put these athletes at ease , " she told @entity0 monday			0
" i 'm hoping that the atmosphere is not overshadowed by this			1
" @entity193 coach @entity192 , who will serve as assistant coach for @entity47 's men 's hockey team , told @entity197 this week that he 's determined to push forward			0
" there 's no doubt that what 's happened lately is certainly -- ( terrorists are ) trying to obviously shake us and probably in a lot of cases they are succeeding			2
but ... we have to try and fight through that , " he said			0
" at the same time , you have to hope that the people in charge are doing the best they can			0
there 's never any guarantees in this life and you 'd like to make it as safe as possible			0
that 's basically all i can say , because my job is to go there and help coach a team and hope that the people in charge of that are going to do the best job they can and make it a successful @entity3			1
" security has also become a top concern for journalists covering the @entity3 this year , said @entity181 special correspondent @entity226 , who will be cohosting the network 's coverage of the opening ceremony			1
" we had a lot of conversations at @entity233 about it and ( @entity181 ) sports , and after a certain point , it 's a bit of a leap of faith , you know , " she told @entity0 's " @entity239			0
" " you hope that the security is there			0
i hope that they ( the @entity30 ) share information more than they have with the @entity84 right now , that 's kind of a rough point			0
and you know , they talk about that ' @entity33 , ' and i hope it 's there			0
" analysts : @entity7 faces unique risk the @entity3 are expected to bring 6,000 athletes from 85 countries to @entity7			1
and throngs of spectators are expected to watch from the stands , with nearly 40,000 security officers standing guard			0
it 's nothing new to worry about security at the @entity3 or any major sporting event			1
and authorities have vowed for months that safety is a top priority			0
but the situation is different in @entity7 , some security experts say , particularly with recent terrorist attacks elsewhere in the country			1
" the threats have been backed up with incidents , with attacks , " said @entity270 , a former crisis response agent for the @entity272 who was at the @entity274 and @entity275			0
" the percentage of something happening from here on is probably high			0
it can happen two days before the @entity3 start , or it can happen today , so that really escalates the intensity of the security apparatus			1
" terror analysts say @entity7 is uniquely at risk because @entity288 militant hotbeds are within the country -- leaving the @entity3 closer than ever to danger			1
" this group does not have to fly in from the @entity293 or @entity294 or @entity295 or some remote location , " former @entity272 assistant director @entity291 said			0
" they are already in the neighborhood			0
" @entity0 's @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .			0
