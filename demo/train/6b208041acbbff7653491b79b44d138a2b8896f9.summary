-- negotiators for @entity2 and six world powers completed the first day of discussions on @entity2 's nuclear program monday in @entity6			1
this third round of talks , called after two previous rounds of discussions yielded little result , was marked by " serious and constructive " discussions , @entity2 's semi-official @entity7 quoted deputy chief negotiator @entity14 as saying			2
an @entity16 official described the meeting as an " intense and tough exchange of views			1
" western powers fear that @entity2 may be trying to build nuclear weapons , despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
the @entity25 has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop @entity2 from producing nuclear arms			1
the @entity16 official , who was not authorized to speak to the media due to the sensitivity of the talks , said @entity2 responded to proposals brought up at the last round of talks in @entity35 , " but , in doing so , brought up lots of questions and well - known positions , including past grievances			1
" @entity2 rejected calls during earlier talks for it not to enrich uranium to the point that it can be used for weapons , while the international powers refused @entity47 's demand for an immediate end to sanctions weighing on its economy			1
@entity2 's leaders also continued to take a firm line outside of the negotiations			0
on monday , @entity2 supreme leader ayatollah @entity55 said the country has been the object of " non-stop conspiracies of all the world powers			0
" " but the efforts of all the hegemonic powers to push the @entity2 nation out of the scene will definitely and surely remain futile again this time , " he said			2
exclusive : @entity65 's president warns " time is out " for @entity2 if the negotiations in @entity6 unravel , the potential consequences for the @entity68 and the rest of the world could be grave			1
@entity65 , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over @entity47 's hostility toward the jewish state , has said it may attack @entity2 to try to stop @entity47 from developing nuclear weapons			1
and @entity2 's strategic position near crucial oil shipping routes means the escalation of tensions could put further pressure on the fragile global economy			0
after the previous round of negotiations in @entity35 last month , which ran beyond the original schedule , @entity16 foreign policy chief @entity82 offered a glimmer of hope for the @entity6 talks			1
" it 's clear that we both want to make progress , " she said at the time			0
@entity2 's top negotiator , @entity92 , struck a nuanced position after the @entity35 talks , asserting @entity2 's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy but also saying that progress had been made during the meeting			1
sanctions imposed on @entity2 by the @entity100 , the @entity101 and the @entity16 were one of the key stumbling blocks			1
the sanctions appear to be inflicting considerable damage on the @entity2 economy			0
and because 80 % of @entity2 's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports , an embargo by the @entity16 set to go into effect in july will add further pressure			2
@entity92 said that the removal of " hostile measures " would increase cooperation			0
" the current strategy of pressure could make the talks come to an end , " he warned			0
@entity2 has previously threatened to close the @entity117 , a vital oil shipping lane , over the sanctions issue			2
but @entity101 secretary of state @entity120 insisted the sanctions will remain in place			0
" @entity2 now has the choice to make , " she said			0
" will it meet its international obligations and give the world confidence about its intentions , or not			0
" the six world powers made @entity2 an offer for stopping its processing of medium - enriched uranium , @entity16 officials said			2
the proposal also called for @entity47 to prove its nuclear program is being used for peaceful purposes as it claims , and comply with @entity136 resolutions , according to a @entity138 official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions			2
@entity2 's counterproposal included five areas of nuclear and non-nuclear cooperation , according to the state - run @entity148			0
adding to the complexity of the situation , a @entity100 report released just after the @entity35 talks said that inspectors had found a high level of enriched uranium in @entity2			1
the @entity100 's @entity157 asked @entity2 to explain the presence of particles of enrichment levels of up to 27 % , found in an analysis of environmental samples taken in february at the @entity164 fuel enrichment plant near the city of @entity166			0
the previous highest level had been 20 % , typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors , but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90 % enrichment required to build nuclear weapons			1
@entity2 said in response that the production of such particles " above the target value " may happen for " technical reasons beyond the operator 's control			0
" @entity2 's @entity180 to leave politics , newspaper reports @entity0 's @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
