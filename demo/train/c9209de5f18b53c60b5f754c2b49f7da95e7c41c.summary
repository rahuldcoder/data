-- a day after violent protests erupted in the restive city of @entity5 , security forces opened fire at protesters in the coastal city of @entity9 , witnesses said			1
anti-government demonstrations in @entity9 had started peacefully before several people were wounded in a hail of gunfire as security forces tightened their control on access to the city , witnesses said			1
however , presidential spokeswoman @entity19 told state media that an unidentified group of gunmen opened fire at citizens and security forces			1
although the group allegedly entered @entity9 " breaking and burning shops , " security forces did not return fire , @entity26 told @entity31 , the country 's official news agency			1
the gunmen killed two security force officers and one demonstrator , she said , blaming the clashes on those attempting to " meddle " in the security and stability of the country			2
" the right to peaceful demonstration is guaranteed to any citizen in @entity44 , " @entity26 said			1
" but what is happening is an attempt to ignite an internal strife in the country and to target the security and stability of the nation and the lives of its citizens			1
" @entity0 could not independently confirm the accounts as the @entity44 government has yet to grant access to the country			1
meanwhile , in the southern city of @entity5 where dozens of people were killed in violent clashes earlier this week , hundreds of @entity44 demonstrated peacefully without security forces present , a witness said			1
the protest also served as a funeral site for throngs of mourners to remember those who died in earlier demonstrations , the witness said			0
friday was marred with reports of casualties in the southern cities of @entity71 and @entity5 where government security forces allegedly opened fire on protesters			1
in @entity5 , dozens were shot in the head and neck and hundreds more were wounded on friday when snipers on rooftops began firing into the crowd , according to a doctor in @entity5 who declined to be named for security reasons			2
the protesters , who were not carrying weapons , chanted , " we need our freedom , we need democracy , " the doctor said			0
in the neighboring city of @entity71 , at least 20 others were killed and more than 60 people wounded friday after government security forces began shooting at demonstrators , the doctor in @entity5 told @entity0			1

women chanted , " we will sacrifice our blood , our lives for you martyrs " as they walked , the witness said			0
presidential spokeswoman @entity26 again blamed " a group of gunmen and smugglers " who allegedly seized police weapons and began shooting			2
their actions compelled security guards to fire back in defense of their post , she said			2
@entity44 state television later broadcast the apparent confessions of foreign nationals arrested in @entity44 , including an @entity122 with @entity124 citizenship who worked in @entity44 , according to @entity31			1
" the @entity122 man said he was receiving e-mails from external forces asking him to send pictures and video clips from @entity44 , " the agency reported , noting that the man had recently vsited @entity133 through @entity134			1
by saturday , security forces had left the city , leaving @entity71 to the @entity44 military			1
the army has since surrounded the city and restricted access to it			0
some residents are anticipating a food shortage as a result of what some describe as a blockade			0
but chants of " @entity150 , @entity44 , and the @entity151 only " seemed to indicate that at least some residents were encouraged by the army 's presence , the witness said			2
one soldier said " they would shoot themselves before they would shoot ( the protesters ) , " the witness added			0
meanwhile , international concern over the escalating violence continued			2
" the situation in @entity44 has worsened considerably over the past week , with the use of live ammunition and tear gas by the authorities having resulted in a total of at least 37 people being killed in @entity5 , including two children , " @entity162 , a spokesman for the office of the @entity164 , said friday			2

there were many casualties in @entity5 , said @entity183 , who asked that his full name not be reported due to security concerns			2
" thousands gathered and moved to the governor 's building in @entity5 , and there they burned a large picture of @entity193 , and then they toppled a statue of @entity195 in the center of the square , " @entity183 said , referring to the current president and his late father , the former president			0
" after that , armed men came out from the roof of the officers ' club in front of the governor 's office and started firing at the crowd , " he said			0
@entity207 , a political dissident , said dozens of people appeared to have been killed or wounded in clashes with security forces in the square , but he could not be precise on the totals			1
earlier friday , thousands attended an anti-government demonstration in the town , according to @entity216 , a political activist in @entity5			0
there , people ridiculed recent government pronouncements of reforms and an assertion by government spokeswoman @entity26 that the country 's president had ordered " no live bullets " would be used against demonstrators			0
one witness said the people chanted , " @entity19 , we do not want your bread , we want dignity ! " he said an " overwhelming number " of protesters showed up in @entity5 to support " martyrs , " people killed in recent clashes			0
" the whole of the city was out in the street to bury the dead and demand that those responsible be tried for their crimes against the people of @entity5 , " the witness said			0
" we broke the barrier of fear today and the security forces could not touch us			1
" the witness said the security forces had withdrawn from the center of the city and did n't interfere with the demonstrations , which are stoked by a range of political and economic grievances			1

on friday , state television showed what it said were pro-government demonstrations in @entity285 and @entity286			0
the state - run @entity31 said its correspondent in @entity5 " reported that the crowds in the spontaneous popular rallies chanted national slogans highly lauding president @entity195 's generous decrees and decisions , pledging their loyalty to his excellency and their unity under his leadership in the face of any conspiracy against @entity44			1
" however , video also emerged of protests in @entity302 , where the government violently suppressed an uprising in 1982			0
