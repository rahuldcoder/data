-- the implementation of the @entity2 is not going well			0
first , the volume of people showing up to @entity5 on october 1 completely crashed the site			0
then , it turned out the data being passed up and back was completely corrupt			0
then , millions of @entity10 began discovering that plans they " liked " were being canceled , and they were being told it was because of the @entity2			0
president @entity13 announced an administrative fix to this problem on thursday : an extension that allows insurers to keep people on health care plans that the @entity2 would not have allowed			1
the cancellations had posed a real problem for the @entity13 administration , because they flew in the face of what many believe is a core promise of health care reform : that you could keep your policy if you liked it			1
millions are finding out this is n't true			0
those of us who have been in the weeds of health policy have known this for a long time			1
the @entity2 changes the way insurance is regulated			1
it declares that many services are now mandatory			0
this included a lot of preventive care , as well as maternity care			2
any policies that do n't provide these services will no longer be offered			2
other policies had very low annual or lifetime limits			2
these , too , have to go away			0
anyone who had one will need to find a new policy			0
it 's very likely that newer policies , with more robust benefits , will be more expensive			1
that will make many people unhappy			0
we can argue that the new policies are still a good deal , or that much of that cost will be defrayed by subsidies , or that future protections to both beneficiaries and their families are worth the added cost , but that 's somewhat beside the point			1
many people feel like they were told they could keep their insurance , and now they think they have been lied to			2
@entity13 knows the law is in trouble			1
many @entity69 feel like they took hard votes and stuck their necks out to support the law , and now that there 's a perception that the executive branch has dropped the ball , their support is not as strong			2
there are a number of bills and fixes being debated			0
that wo n't be easy , though			2
that 's in part because no insurance plan sticks around forever			1
plans change from year to year , premiums change from year to year , coverage changes from year to year , and deductibles , copays , and co-insurance change from year to year			0
it has never been the case that you could be guaranteed that your plan would exist -- as it does today -- for as long as you would like			0
i 've had plans i 've liked canceled many times in my 10 years working at my current job			0
one bill being put forth in the @entity102 would allow insurers to continue to offer plans that have been discontinued due to the @entity2			0
the problem with that is that many insurance companies do n't want to continue to offer those plans indefinitely			1
they do n't make sense financially			0
therefore , passing this law wo n't stop millions of @entity10 from getting cancellation notices anyway			0
a different bill in the @entity112 would force insurance companies to continue to offer those plans or leave the state entirely			1
if you thought the @entity2 was a government takeover before , this bill is much , much worse			0
it would compel insurance companies to comply with a whole new host of potentially unprofitable regulations			1
the truth of the matter is there is no easy solution here			2
disrupting the current system is n't a bug of health care reform ; it 's a feature			1
it 's what was supposed to happen			2
all reform will do so			0
even @entity134 proposals , like sen. @entity138 's when he was running for president , to change the health insurance tax deduction , would have completely upended the employer - sponsored health insurance system			1
then - sen. @entity13 attacked him savagely for just that back in 2008			1
it 's fine for president @entity142 and others to just " demand " this be fixed			2
unfortunately , it ca n't be , at least not easily and not cheaply			0
letting healthy people keep these plans ( because most of those in the @entity150 individual market are healthier ) and stay out of the exchanges will raise the premiums for everyone else , and thus the amount the government will have to pay in subsidies			1
forcing insurance companies to continue to offer old plans in a new marketplace could wind up hurting their bottom line significantly			1
@entity13 's administrative fix , much like the @entity102 bill , allow plans offered this year to remain in place if people want them			1
but that will just shift blame to the insurance companies when they cancel them			1
for many of the reasons above , they wo n't want to keep them going			0
the real problem here , and one that few are addressing , is that the old health care system is n't that good			1
we wanted to change it			0
doing so means that it , well , changes			0
if we liked our old health care system , we could keep it			1
but we did n't , and so at some point we 're going to have to accept a new one			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 : @entity13 's *quick* " fix " on insurance cancellations puts off needed changes
he says @entity150 mandates *adequate* care ; policies without it must go away
he says " fix " just shifts blame to the insurance companies when they cancel policies
@entity183 : to fix broken health care , we must accept changes . there are no easy answers
