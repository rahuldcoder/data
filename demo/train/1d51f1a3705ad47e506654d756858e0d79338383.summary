farmers ' frequent use of antibiotics to help their livestock grow is contributing to the rise of dangerous antibiotic - resistant bacteria , according to the @entity6			1
on wednesday , the government agency announced a new plan to phase out the use of certain antibiotics in the food production industry			1
" it is important to use these drugs only when medically necessary , " the @entity6 said on its website			1
" governments around the world consider antimicrobial - resistant bacteria a major threat to public health			1
" many of the antibiotics used in animals are also used to treat humans when they get sick			2
illnesses caused by bacteria are more likely to be fatal if overuse has made the germs resistant to medication , the @entity6 says			1
an @entity6 report released in april showed that 81 % of all the raw ground turkey the agency tested was contaminated with antibiotic - resistant bacteria			1
and turkey was n't the only problem -- antibiotic - resistant bacteria were found in about 69 % of pork chops , 55 % of ground beef and 39 % of chicken			1
antibiotics are used in livestock to prevent disease , but they are also used as a protectant and to aid growth			0
about 29.9 million pounds of antibiotics were sold in 2011 for meat and poultry production , compared with the 7.7 million pounds sold for human use , according to the @entity45			0
" antibiotic use in animals is out of hand , " said dr. @entity46 , a veterinarian and senior officer for the @entity48 on @entity49 and @entity50 , a project aimed at phasing out overuse of antibiotics in food production			1
" we feed antibiotics to sick animals , which is completely appropriate , but we also put antibiotics in their feed and in their water to help them grow faster and to compensate for unhygienic conditions			2
if you have to keep the animals healthy with drugs , i would argue you need to re-examine the system			2
you do n't take antibiotics preventively when you go out into the world			0
" what government tests found in your meat the @entity6 will now begin working to address how farmers are using these drugs to enhance animals ' growth or reduce the amount of feed they have to use			1
its plan also explains how animal pharmaceutical companies can voluntarily revise their drug labels to remove animal production as an approved use , effectively making it illegal to use the drugs for growth enhancement			0
under the plan , therapeutic uses of animal antibiotics would require veterinary oversight , meaning antibiotics could be used in food - producing animals only under a veterinarian 's orders to treat , prevent or control disease			1
" with these changes , there will be fewer approved uses , and the remaining uses will be under tighter control , " said @entity98 , deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine at the @entity6			2
companies have 90 days to let the @entity6 know if they intend to participate and three years to make the changes			2
in a statement , the @entity109 said it and its member companies support the policy and will continue to work with the @entity6 to implement it			2
" we are in favor of maintaining the important therapeutic uses of disease treatment , disease control and disease prevention , and believe that phasing out sub-therapeutic uses will increase consumer confidence that antibiotics are being used wisely to protect animal health and thereby human health , " the organization said			0
the @entity124 also said it welcomed the move			0
what 's in your holiday poultry ? " @entity124 strongly supports the prudent and judicious use of antibiotics in food animal production under the care of a veterinarian , as defined by the @entity134 , which is consistent with protecting both animal and public health , ensuring the ability to medically treat animals , and maintaining the highest standard of animal welfare practices , " the group said , adding the @entity6 proposal " adheres to these principles			1
" but the @entity144 , a non-profit environmental advocacy group , bashed the @entity6 's plan , saying it fails to require any change in the use of antibiotics			1
" @entity6 's policy is an early holiday gift to industry , " @entity144 health attorney @entity149 said in a statement			2
" it is a hollow gesture that does little to tackle a widely recognized threat to human health			0
@entity6 has essentially followed a voluntary approach for more than 35 years , but use of these drugs to raise animals has increased			1
" the @entity161 noted in a statement the proposal " requires the drug companies who profit from sales of their drugs to initiate the process			0
the good news is the agency has pledged to evaluate levels of compliance and inform the public after 90 days if the drug industry is cooperating with the relabeling effort			0
" " no one is advocating that sick animals should not be treated , " the @entity161 said			0
" but just as our kids see a doctor to get antibiotics , farmers should call a veterinarian , who can assess whether and when treatment with an antibiotic is appropriate			0
this simple step could save antibiotics as treatment options for future generations of consumers and farmers			0
" currently , federal law tracks only how many antibiotics are sold ; it does not mandate data collection on how many animals are given the drugs or how much			1
without that information , it is hard to know where antibiotics are used			0
@entity98 said the @entity6 still has the ability to take regulatory action against specific products if it 's needed to protect the public 's health			0
this plan is the @entity6 's latest move targeting food production and quality			1
last month , the agency took a step toward potentially eliminating most trans fats from the food supply			0
