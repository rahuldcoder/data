-- whether it 's through film , tv or pages of a book , you may have flown a tardis with a time lord , walked on the moon with @entity10 , survived the @entity11 , and perhaps even fallen in love with a character of the likes of @entity16 's mr. @entity15			1
but faithful fans are n't leaving their love for their interests at home			1
instead , they 're setting course to destinations where their geeky passions come alive			2
from the sweeping emerald landscapes of @entity26 where one can wander the trails of the cinematic middle - earth of " @entity29 " to @entity30 for the ultimate " @entity32 " experience , devotees are seizing the chance to experience their fandom up close and personal			1
for @entity38 @entity37 , a book report in fourth grade would start a lifelong love affair with @entity41 's world			1
though our " muggle " world may not have magical potions to ensnare the senses , potterheads like her can apparate ( or take a plane or car ) to @entity50 , an enchanting theme park inside @entity52 fit for any wizard			2
complete with a snow - capped @entity55 , a @entity56 and recognizable shops including @entity58 and @entity59 , fans can immerse themselves in magic that has been lifted from the series			1
" @entity41 's books are so rich in detail , taking a pilgrimage like this was like looking directly into her imagination , " @entity37 says			2
" i think i scared nearby small children with my level of excitement			2
it was like stepping into one of the books , which is any fan 's dream come true			2
" for many nerds , a pilgrimage goes beyond simple sightseeing and becomes a rite of passage			2
most of the readers who shared stories of their nerdy pilgrimages with @entity0 felt their experiences cemented their love for their respective passions			2
the object of @entity89 's veneration is tucked away in @entity90 , @entity91			1
designed by legendary anime filmmaker @entity93 , renowned for movies like " @entity95 " and " @entity96 , " the whimsical @entity92 is the perfect place to see @entity93 's animations come to life			1
with a playful interior , the museum houses detailed models , artful storyboards and several exhibits that invite @entity92 admirers to pause and savor			2
" the experience was very meaningful because it was a chance to see the behind - the - scenes and creative process of a major animation studio whose work i have so admired , " @entity89 says			1
" to have visited the museum felt like reaching a certain pinnacle as a fan and i felt extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to do so			2
" it 's these pinnacle experiences that become the driving force behind a pilgrimage , but each full - hearted adventurer has a unique motivation for wanting to take one			1
if you 're a literary nerd like @entity126 , not only do you fall in love with imagined characters who sit on your bookshelf , but you also fall in love with the minds that have penned them to life			1
" you realize that it was n't the characters that so captivated your thoughts , but rather , it was the author who created them who you were in love with all along , " @entity126 said in a @entity135			1
wanting to explore the world of @entity144 novelist @entity16 , @entity126 set off from her home in @entity146 to the charming @entity148 countryside -- the place of inspiration for stories that would become timeless novels like " @entity153 " and " @entity154			1
" @entity16 fans can take a stroll through the 17th - century cottage , now a museum , where the author spent the last eight years of her life in the village of @entity162			1
" you get a clearer picture of how she lived and how she might have formed her characterizations by the way her environment shaped her , " @entity126 said			0
" i could n't believe that i was actually walking in the footsteps of history			0
sometimes i had to stop and say to myself , ' @entity16 actually walked this path			0
' " undertaking a pilgrimage may not be for everyone , but it certainly offers enthusiasts the opportunity to not just imagine how things may be , but to see things as they really are			0
for a @entity179 like @entity180 , what better place to come face - to - face with the " @entity32 " universe than @entity183 , an interactive journey that takes fans behind - the - scenes of the iconic show			1
on @entity191 in @entity192 , @entity30 , the attraction showcases sets and an incredible collection of artifacts and costumes that span the 50 - year history of " @entity32			1
" " i 've been a ' @entity32 ' fan since childhood , so approximately 40 years			0
seeing all the sights was astounding , " he says			0
" it was a fantastic day			0
not only the exhibition , but also getting the chance to visit many of the external filming locations in the area			0
" though gaining a deeper connection to the show was a rewarding experience for @entity180 , he said going with a worthy companion , his son , made for a more meaningful one			0
" my son is 9 years old and a huge fan of the latest regeneration of the doctor , " he said			0
" getting to share a visit with him to many of the props , costumes and sets made this an unforgettable experience			0
" the beauty of these trips is in memories that last long after the experience			0
the journey is almost always so brimming with heartfelt emotion and zeal that it resists being reduced to a typical set of vacation snapshots			0
and there 's certainly nothing typical about finding yourself at the doorstep of a @entity239 - hole home			1
with countless " @entity29 " tours available , @entity26 has quickly become a place of pilgrimage for " @entity29 " fanatics			0
drawing new energy with the release of " @entity239 : an @entity251 " in december , @entity245 are flocking to spectacular locations like @entity247 , where @entity248 filmed his @entity250 winning trilogy			0
" now i can say that i have seen middle - earth , " said @entity252 , who took a @entity254 movie set tour to see the stunning fantasyland for himself			1
" i never stopped taking shots from every angle of the place			0
it was an amazing experience , " he said			0
" it was more than what i expected because our tour guide even told us some secrets on how @entity248 filmed the movies			0
" as most nerds know , being homesick for a place you 've never been to is not an unfamiliar feeling			0
in fact , it 's that longing that breathes life into a pilgrimage			1
in the book " @entity239 , " @entity277 writes about @entity279 : " then something @entity281 woke up inside him and he wished to go and see the great mountains , and hear the pine trees and the waterfalls , and explore the caves , and wear a sword instead of a walking - stick			1
" perhaps there 's a @entity281 wanderlust that begs to be awakened in us all .			0
