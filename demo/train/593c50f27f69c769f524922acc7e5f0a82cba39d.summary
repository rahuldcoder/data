editor 's note : @entity2 is an ethnographer , social media consultant and blogger based in @entity5 , @entity6			1
her personal blog is conversations with @entity2			1
she has contributed to building several communities on the @entity10 , such as @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			2
@entity2 says social networks channeled the sadness and rage of the attacks into action			1
@entity5 , @entity6 ( @entity21 ) -- i celebrated my 42nd birthday on november 26			1
we were thinking of stepping out for a coffee at the @entity27 hotel that night when a friend called to say there was a terrorist attack in town			2
my first reaction was to switch on the tv and simultaneously go online to @entity34			1
there was a lot of confusion , anger and sadness as we witnessed together parts of our city go up in flames -- icons and symbols that stand for the @entity5 i grew up in			1
i live about 8 kilometers from the scenes of the attacks			1
many of us did n't sleep much that night			2
some of us have worked together during disasters like the tsunamis and @entity50 , and we used our influence and experience to get the word out			2
our updates and conversations on @entity34 kept us connected			1
@entity34 is a social tool where social networking meets blogging			1
many have referred to it as microblogging , as each post -- or " tweet " -- you make is restricted to 140 characters			2
we did n't feel alone anymore or scared			2
fellow tweeters worldwide were experiencing and sharing in our pain and our anger during the prolonged siege			1
the morning after , a friend and fellow blogger in the @entity72 asked me how i was coping with it all			2
her question was whether i found myself working it through intellectually or emotionally			2
my answer was that there was anger			2
and i was not alone in feeling it			0
blogging and @entity34 allowed me to channel this anger			1
we were busy trying to source authentic news and information around lists of injured and deceased , hospitals requiring blood , and helping folks abroad and in other cities in @entity6 connect with their friends and family			1
some of the little things that touched me were people all over the world just volunteering time , love and attention through hugs and words of solace			0
one example : we had a list of injured people -- an illegible fax -- and after tweeting that we needed help transcribing it , we were flooded with offers to help from all over the world			0
others abroad were busy proclaiming that they would run to @entity6 and not from it			0
here are just a few of the tweets : i ca n't say do n't be sad , but do n't be overwhelmed with sadness			1
know that there 's still more love than hate			0
there are more good and decent people in the world than hateful ones			0
even if that 's hard to see today			0
overwhelmed by the kind and touching emails that my clients have sent since yesterday			0
all affirm faith in @entity6 and @entity6			0
i join you and all the brave people of @entity6 ! from nyc , we pray for you and thank you for your courage in reporting to the rest of the world			0
it has greatly helped many just feelings of solidarity with all of you in @entity5 we all are			1
. : ( # mumbai so sorry for you and your fellow peace loving @entity6 sadness is not the word but anger that should be vented out before we subside into our own daily life these spontaneous responses bring home so strongly that what we are dealing with is not just @entity5 's problem or @entity6 's problem alone			1
this could never have happened without the social web			1
it is taking many new people forward on journeys that before they would n't have even contemplated			0
on monday , a bunch of us met at @entity160 , one of the sites attacked last week , and lighted some candles and had a beer			0
many of us are being asked how people can contribute to help families affected , and today we meet with non-governmental organizations to try to work out how we can harness this amazing energy online into raising funds for those affected by the attacks in the short term			1
we 've been speaking to activist groups on different continents about how we could pool the community and our learnings to make a difference			0
the " we " i speak of is not an organization but a loosely joined community			0
we are bonded , and i truly believe that in the face of utter horror , wherever it might occur , we have a strong pillar in this emotional connection we feel as equal human beings and not in our narrow identities prescribed by nationality or religion or race or gender			0
this is an evolving revolution sparked by how people are using social tools on the @entity195			1
of course , as with any social system , there will always be those who wish to perpetuate the politics of religion , of division and hate			2
we see this on the @entity195 , too			0
the dilemma is , do we engage with them , and can we ? there is no doubt we are being violated in every way , by politics , by religion , by a complete breakdown of security			0
and yet , i find i do not want to have that discourse or feed these divisions			0
it feels like a violation of my own person			0
leave that to the politicians			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
