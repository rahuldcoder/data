-- @entity1 was , at heart , a storyteller			1
in that dramatic , @entity5 voice , he sang songs -- about prisons , about trains , about loneliness and hurt and truth -- and made them his own , sounding as if he 'd lived them himself			1
" @entity14 , " " @entity15 , " " @entity16 " -- whether @entity1 wrote them or not , he made you believe			1
" that was his chief strength , " says @entity18 , the author of a new cash biography , " @entity1 : the life			1
" " he was always best when he tried to tell his own story , or something he cared about			2
" the thing about being a storyteller , of course , is that stories are often embellished			1
despite being the subject of scores of articles -- and having written two autobiographies himself -- the tales of his life often varied , depending on the time , the setting and the tale - teller			1
this is not to diminish @entity1 's faith and character , but it proved a challenge in writing a biography , says @entity18 , a longtime music reporter who interviewed cash several times and witnessed the famed 1968 @entity48 concert			1
" the surprising thing to me was how much you had to check what @entity51 said			2
he would often exaggerate or dramatize what happened , " he says			2
" it would be a germ of truth , but he would make it into something more interesting to convey that truth			1
" moreover , @entity1 's complete story was mostly hidden			1
when @entity18 asked cash manager @entity63 how much of the @entity1 story had been told , @entity63 replied , " about 20 %			1
" " @entity1 : a life " attempts to clear the air			1
@entity67 , a few of the fascinating stories from @entity1 's colorful life : 1			1
his name was actually @entity1			1
his mother wanted to name him @entity51 , after her father			2
his father wanted to name him @entity74 , after himself			2
so the two settled on " @entity76 " cash did n't adopt the name " @entity51 " until he was in his teens			1
he , ah , borrowed a lot of what became " @entity14			1
" cash was fascinated by prison songs , and more to the point , by loneliness			1
( he never served hard time himself , though he did a few nights in local jails			2
) for his signature hit , he was inspired by a prison documentary he saw in the @entity90 and a @entity92 song called " @entity93			2
" the @entity92 song has a similar structure , a similar melody and many of the same lines , but what cash added was his distinctive directness -- " i shot a man in @entity101 just to watch him die " is all cash -- and that uptempo chicka - chicka rhythm			2
he never denied using @entity105 ' song			2
" he will tell you in a minute that he stole the song , " his longtime bassist , @entity106 , told @entity18			0
" but he made it a more interesting song			0
" ( @entity1 did , though , end up paying @entity92 $ 75,000			1
the chicka - chicka sound was an accident			0
cash 's songs are noted for their distinctive rhythmic clicking sound , one that echoes the trains he liked to write about so much			2
you can thank the amateurishness of early cash practices with @entity106 and @entity121 , the @entity122			2
" they were literally going from one note to the next like someone typing in a halting hunt - and - peck style , " writes @entity18			0
" they just could n't get beyond that simple , primitive sound			0
... it was just about the only way they could play			0
he and @entity133 had the same manager			0
try @entity136 , originally a dj at a @entity138 radio station			0
@entity136 was a friend of @entity140 ' @entity139 -- the two later founded a management firm -- and handled @entity133 for about 18 months until @entity135 came into the picture in 1955			0
@entity136 let @entity135 take over @entity133 's management and took on @entity1 and other @entity140 musicians			1
but lightning struck him twice : cash struck up a friendship with @entity148 , a @entity149 booking agent , who became @entity136 's management partner -- and then @entity1 's sole manager			1
" all of a sudden @entity148 comes in and ( @entity136 's ) thinking , ' this ca n't happen twice , ' and he takes him away , " says @entity18			0
cash later left @entity148 for @entity153 , who guided his career until the 1970s			2
he did n't start wearing black for " the poor and beaten down			0
" that may have become true , as he sings in " @entity158 " -- cash always had sympathy for the downtrodden -- but the original reason was simply because he liked it			1
" i 'm comfortable in it , " he told @entity163 in 2002			0
and why not ? fashionistas will tell you : @entity167 is stylish and hides a host of sins			0
he was a champion hotel room destroyer			0
wrecking hotel rooms is now associated with the excesses of rock stars -- @entity174 was a particularly bad boy -- but @entity1 was so adept at it that he knew exactly what the furnishings cost			1
@entity18 quotes @entity178 -- admittedly a pretty good tale - spinner himself -- who once got in an argument with @entity1 and went on a spree			1
with each item @entity178 broke , @entity1 named the price			1
@entity178 was then sent a bill by management			0
" all of @entity1 's predicted costs were accurate right down to the penny , " @entity18 writes			1
the @entity190 suicide attempt ? probably did n't happen			0
this story has become part of cash lore			2
hooked on drugs , miserable over his divorce , @entity1 crawled into @entity122 's @entity190 in 1967 and waited to die			1
instead , he found @entity196 and decided to quit drugs			0
but , @entity18 discovered , " @entity190 was underwater in the fall of 1967			0
" and @entity1 did n't get clean immediately ; he was still taking pills at the 1968 @entity48 concert months later			1
the tale had a point , though			0
" the story dramatized the feelings of helplessness and recovery , " writes @entity18			0
there are more cash - @entity207 duets out there			2
the two sang together on @entity207 's " @entity210 , " which appeared on @entity207 's " @entity211			0
" but producer @entity212 recorded several songs at the february 1969 session , including @entity1 's " @entity215 " and " @entity216 , " as well as some @entity218 tunes			1
though it has popped up on bootlegs , the music has never been officially released			0
" i do n't understand why @entity221 does n't release that album , " @entity18 says			0
" it might have confused fans at that time , but today , as a historical document , it 's just amazing			0
he should n't be filed under " country			0
" no offense to the denizens of @entity230 , but @entity1 was bigger than country music			1
" he never wanted to go to @entity232			0
he wanted to separate himself , " says @entity18			2
" he was n't aiming for that hit on the jukebox			0
he was as interested in gospel music and folk music and blues as he was probably in country music , and when rock ' n ' roll comes along he incorporates part of that			0
" @entity1 , he continues , " had a very wide vision			1
i never realized until i started writing the book and researching how strong an artist he was			0
he wanted to record the music he wanted to record , and that was pretty amazing			0

@entity1 is the subject of a new biography
cash had truth in his voice , but he was master storyteller
challenge for biographer to separate facts from *fiction*
