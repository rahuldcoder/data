-- some voters are still pining for @entity2 to pick a dream running mate who 's likely out of reach -- a candidate who has said she wo n't run			1
" gov. @entity2 , if you 're watching , please pick @entity10 , " said @entity6 , a @entity2 supporter in @entity7 , @entity8			1
" she 's going to help you with your expertise and foreign affairs , and she has all the experience you 're looking for			2
i think she will help swing the election your way when it comes time			0
i think she 'll add that excitement that your campaign needs			0
" @entity0 asked @entity20 across the political spectrum to weigh in on who would best fill out @entity2 's ticket			1
among the dozens of responses , @entity24 , the former secretary of state under @entity25 , was the most popular pick			1
sen. @entity34 of @entity35 , rep. @entity32 of @entity33 , sen. @entity28 of @entity29 and former @entity31 gov. @entity30 were among other popular choices			1
rating @entity2 's possible running mates @entity24 , who some see as a @entity40 @entity39 , has made it pretty clear she 's not interested in the job of vice president : " i can not imagine myself running for office , " she told @entity0 's " @entity45 " in january			1
" not because politics are so tough , but it 's just not me			2
" @entity24 reiterated on @entity48 last month , " there is no way that i will do this because it 's really not me			2
gov. @entity2 needs to find someone who wants to run with him			2
there are many people who will do it very , very well			0
" still , voters seem to be calling out her name as they wait for @entity2 's expected vp announcement			1
" she 's so experienced in the government , she 's extremely intelligent , she 's a woman and she 's @entity65 , " said @entity61 from @entity62 , @entity8			2
" all of these qualities could help @entity2 beat @entity67 , and to me , that 's the main goal			2
" a @entity2 - @entity24 ticket would restore " hope to @entity72 , " said @entity73 of @entity74 , @entity75			0
" @entity2 and @entity24 would bring back prosperity , enthusiasm and complement each other in bringing @entity72 back to the great country we once were , " @entity73 said			0
" @entity24 is not a career politician ; she left @entity82 when her time was up and never , ever looked back			0
this makes a statement to the character of this lady			0
" @entity88 , 16 , concedes that @entity24 would complement @entity2 on foreign affairs but said , " if that 's the point , you can just reappoint her as secretary of state			0
that 's what secretary of state is for			0
" the teen from @entity97 , @entity33 , said he thinks his home state can offer the perfect running mate for @entity2			0
" i 'd pick @entity33 rep. @entity32 , " he said , " because he 's a safe , yet daring pick and is young but is still experienced , so he could , from on @entity103 , step into the presidency			1
" @entity88 said that despite @entity32 being in his early 40s , he has a lot of experience , as he has been in the @entity107 since 1999			1
add in that @entity32 is from @entity33 and that he could appeal to both tea party and establishment @entity40 figures , @entity88 said			1
speaking of certain states being key , @entity29 is another one that may be important for @entity2			0
@entity113 , a college student in @entity114 , @entity29 , argues that @entity28 is the man for the job			1
" whoever wins @entity29 can pretty much guarantee the presidency , " he said			0
" @entity28 is a pretty popular senator in the state			1
he won his last election by a landslide , and he still remains pretty popular , especially in his home county of @entity122			0
" @entity113 supports president @entity67 but said @entity2 should also pick @entity28 because " he is a proven attack dog , and he has foreign policy credentials			1
" some said they thought loyalty to @entity2 should play a larger role than credentials in his selection			0
the smartest choice would be former @entity31 gov. @entity30 , according to left - leaning independent @entity132			1
" you have a guy with executive experience , he has some foreign policy experience , he 's been incredibly loyal to the @entity2 campaign , " said the free - lancer from @entity134			0
" he 's not super exciting , but he 's not going to overshadow the candidate either			0
" adding excitement to @entity2 's campaign was a common refrain sung by most ireporters , but there was disagreement as to which candidate would bring forth the energy			0
@entity34 would be up to the challenge , but he could also be " a true jewel to the @entity2 campaign , " said @entity152			1
" i believe he would excite young people to vote @entity40 more , and sen. @entity34 would bring a great wealth of knowledge to the @entity2 campaign for cultural diversity , " the @entity154 , native said			1
" he 'll just be a great access for minorities in the @entity40			2
" @entity162 said he would also like @entity34 to run alongside @entity2 , mostly because the senator holds strong conservative values			1
" i think @entity34 is very articulate , intelligent , great personality , charismatic and most of all , very conservative , " said the @entity165 , @entity166 , resident			2
" he will make @entity169 look like a dunce in debates			0

@entity0 asked @entity20 to weigh in on who they think would make the best @entity40 vp pick
@entity10 was the most popular pick among @entity20 , but she 's said she wo n't run
@entity34 , @entity32 , @entity28 and @entity30 were among the other top choices
