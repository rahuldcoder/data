@entity44 has leverage that may have affected @entity24 's decision last month to backpedal on the @entity12 talks because @entity4 supplies @entity1 with natural gas			1
the @entity12 is also pressuring @entity24 to free his chief political opponent , @entity167 , who has languished in jail for two years after being convicted of abuse of power in 2011			2
