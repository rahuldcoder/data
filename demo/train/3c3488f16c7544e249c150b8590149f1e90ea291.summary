whether they 're hanging inside prestigious art hotspots , such as the @entity4 in @entity5 , or in the houses of @entity7 and @entity8 , the thought - provoking creations of @entity1 have captivated audiences across the world			1
aged just 31 , @entity12 - born @entity11 is one of the fastest - rising talents in the contemporary african art scene			1
his arresting body of work is increasingly defined by the use of mixed media , as @entity11 combines paintings and drawings with videos and photographs to address issues such as democracy and xenophobia			1
but for some , @entity11 is much more than an artist			1
he has been described as a poet , an activist and a cultural philosopher who uses his striking -- and at times dark -- creations to tackle the political and social issues that are close to his heart			1
" you ca n't escape politics , " explains @entity11 , who lives and works in @entity36			1
" everything 's political in the sense like how we 're socialized			2

he stirred up controversy during the build - up to @entity12 's violent and disputed 2008 elections with a series of controversial depictions of president @entity56			1
@entity11 's posters , which showed @entity56 in flames with horns on his head , raised the ire of @entity12 's ruling elite and got @entity11 into trouble			1
the young artist says he was threatened with arrest and has been living in self - imposed exile ever since			2
although he knew the implications of criticizing one of @entity36 's most feared strongmen , @entity11 remained unfazed			1
he describes the hardships that many of his countrymen were suffering amid a deepening economic crisis in the once - prosperous southern @entity36 country			2
" @entity75 has always played an important role in telling these stories , " he explains			2
" whether it 's through painting or posters ; whether it mirrors a thought or it mirrors an idea ; whether it mirrors a conversation that should be had			2
i thought that , in that instance , it was possible to do that in one image			2
" the series of posters galvanized @entity12 living in @entity36 to speak out against what was happening in their country			1
inspired by @entity92 street artist @entity91 , @entity11 also used stencils and spray paint to create outdoor murals depicting the fear of elections in @entity12 and xenophobic attacks in @entity36			1

" with every generation you always want to be the generation that contributed something , " he says			0
" i always say if there 's a vacancy in history , you should apply for it ... so for me it was that -- the poster boy thing sort of came as a result of that but then for me it was like i wanted to do something , i thought that was important			0
" but the recent defacing of a controversial painting of @entity36 president @entity128 and violent demonstrations in @entity130 over what some have branded religiously offensive art have many questioning whether artistic expression is being suppressed in parts of the continent			0
@entity11 sees it as the re-emergence of artistic activism			1
he says that this is something the world needs more of			0
" it is very important for the average person to have a voice out there , " he says			0
" so it 's more important now than ever			0
" @entity11 's latest installation , " @entity149 , " is currently being shown in one of the world 's most esteemed art displays : the @entity153 13 in @entity154 , @entity155			1
for " @entity149 , " he combined a series of narrative mediums to make art accessible to a new generation of @entity160 -- a group he says no one tries to talk to			0
" we 're almost kind of left to our own devices and we 're raised by @entity165 , or we 're raised by @entity166 " he says			0
" they are like our pseudo family , these sort of multimedia spaces , like bloggers have become brothers and sisters to random people			0
" through his art , @entity11 says , he wants to spark a conversation with the youth of the continent			2
" being able to find a way to communicate with people -- and beyond just writing within a blog space or within live tv -- if it 's in some way engaging to them , i think you have sort of started a conversation with them because it 's within a language they understand			0
so it makes the communication easier			0
" being born a year after @entity12 's independence , @entity11 is part of what is known as the " born - free generation " on the @entity36 continent			1
he says that some young @entity160 are beginning to realize the influence and power they hold			0
" they underestimate their capabilities and abilities to be able participants in change and the direction of politics , " he says			0
" some are starting to see that and acknowledge that			0
we are in a position where we can change or contribute something			0
we are in a position where , as a ' born - free generation , ' we wo n't be forgotten			0
