eighty - one years after the death of his creator , sir @entity8 , and more than 100 years since the last original story , the world 's greatest detective returns in a new novel , " @entity11			1
" the novel may be the peak of what 's been recent @entity1 renaissance , including " @entity1 , " a successful , modern adaptation for the @entity17			1
there 's also a @entity21 film starring @entity22 and @entity23 which re-imagines @entity1 and @entity3 as steampunk action heroes , it was a hit with movie - goers , even spawning a sequel this holiday			1
bookstore shelves are loaded with tributes , pastiches , spinoffs and repackaged versions of the " sacred 60 , " sir @entity8 's 56 original short stories and 4 novels , but " @entity11 " stands apart			1
it 's the first new @entity1 novel authorized and written with the endorsement of the @entity8 estate			1
picking up the @entity40 pipe is @entity41 , a bestselling novelist and television producer from @entity43			0
@entity41 penned the extremely popular , @entity45 series , about a teenage super-spy			0
he 's also written and produced several popular television dramas , including " @entity48 , " and " @entity49 " both seen on @entity50			2
@entity41 says he did n't tinker much with @entity8 's creation , hoping to preserve the flavor and tone of the original stories while giving the new novel a modern sensibility and pace			1
" @entity11 " is set in 1890 , a @entity58 shrouded in fog and shadow , where @entity62 cabs still roam the streets			2
@entity3 now lives in a retirement home , @entity1 is dead a year			1
@entity3 recounts one of their earlier cases , so shocking ; the pages of its telling have stayed in his solicitor 's safe for 100 years			1
now , the usual cast of characters is reunited ; mrs. @entity74 , @entity75 , the @entity76 , @entity1 ' brother @entity77 , even the evil @entity78			2
there 's a train robbery , a prison break , a carnival freak show , a high - speed chase by horse drawn carriage and a criminal gang that leaves a strip of white silk as their calling card			0
once again , the game is afoot			0
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity41 about continuing the @entity1 canon ; the following is an edited transcript			2
@entity0 : how long have you been a fan of @entity1 ? do you remember reading your first @entity1 story ? @entity41 : i was given a complete collection of @entity1 short stories and the four novels when i was 16			1
i remember reading " @entity102 " first and loving it			0
the book has a wonderful story with the tentacles of imperial @entity106 spreading all the way to suburban @entity58			0
it has great characters , a macabre murder and a terrific chase down the @entity112			0
from that moment , i was hooked			0
@entity0 : this is the first time the @entity8 estate has authorized a new @entity1 novel , how did you get involved ? @entity41 : an agent approached me , but in the end i had very little to do with the estate			1
it was important to me that i should be allowed to work on my own so nobody gave me notes , i did n't have to show my manuscript to the estate , i was n't told what i could or could n't do			0
to be fair to the estate , they put their complete trust in me and i hope i 've repaid it			0
@entity0 : with so many fans worldwide , how daunting a challenge was this ? @entity41 : to be honest , i would n't have accepted the assignment if i did n't think i could do it and in the end i found the process , if not exactly easy , then remarkably stress - free			0
in fact , i loved every minute of the writing			0
it was a huge privilege to inhabit 221b @entity136 for four months in the company of two great literary figures			0
@entity0 : much about " @entity11 " has been kept top secret until now			2
what can you tell us about the book ? @entity41 : it 's set in the winter of 1890 , in @entity58 and begins with an art dealer who believes he is being followed			0
he has come into contact with a vicious @entity149 gang and it seems that one of their number is out for revenge			0
but very soon the story spirals out of control and @entity1 finds himself drawn into a much wider and deadlier conspiracy that could destroy the entire fabric of @entity43 society			1
@entity0 : do you have a favorite @entity1 story ? @entity41 : " @entity164 " is my favorite story			1
it has no murder and very few characters but it 's wonderfully ingenious and shows @entity1 at his best			1
" @entity11 " starts three days after " @entity164 " ends			2
@entity0 : why do you think @entity1 has remained arguably the world 's most popular detective for more than 100 years ? @entity41 : well , he was the first , the father of all modern detectives			1
but i think what makes him so unforgettable is his relationship with @entity3			2
he is austere , irritating , aloof			0
@entity3 is warm , loyal , affable			2
together , they have the greatest friendship in literature			0
@entity0 : you have a hugely successful career in books , film & tv , how big an impact did the @entity1 stories have on you as a writer ? @entity41 : it 's probably true to say that they helped to steer me towards murder mystery			1
i always had a love of puzzles , illusions , magic			0
@entity1 pressed all the right buttons			2
