the @entity1 administration hopes to transfer dozens of detainees from @entity4 in the next six months as part of a stepped - up effort to reduce the population there , according to a @entity10 official			1
as many as five detainees are expected to be moved from the detention facility in the next few days , with several more transfers anticipated in early 2015 , the official said on condition of anonymity			1
the news comes less than a week after the @entity10 announced it had repatriated four detainees from @entity4 to @entity18 , leaving 132 detainees at the @entity10 naval base in southeastern @entity21			1
president @entity1 hinted at the intensified effort in an exclusive interview on @entity2 's " @entity24 " on sunday , saying , " i 'm going to be doing everything i can to close it			1
" " it is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world , the fact that these folks are being held , " @entity1 said			1
" it is contrary to our values and it is wildly expensive			0
we 're spending millions for each individual there			0
and we have drawn down the population there significantly			0
" once a detainee is deemed no longer a risk , they are either transferred back to their country of origin , or a third country that is willing to take them			0
sixty - four of the 132 remaining detainees have been ruled eligible for transfer			2
of the 64 eligible , 54 are from @entity51			0
but the @entity10 is not willing , at this point , to send them back to @entity51 because of concerns that the government -- under pressure from @entity57 and @entity58 militants -- can not ensure they do not join @entity57 elements there			0
the administration for the last several months has been trying to find a country that will take the @entity51 and provide security and human rights assurances for them			0
the official said there are ongoing talks to try to find countries to take all 64 detainees approved for transfer			2
an additional 20 detainees from @entity51 still are considered too dangerous to be transferred , as are several detainees accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks , including @entity77			2
the number of remaining detainees is down significantly from the nearly 800 that had been held there after @entity4 was repurposed to hold detainees from the @entity10 ' war on terror			1
the administration of then - president @entity86 claimed that , since @entity88 detainees were n't held on @entity10 soil , they could be considered " enemy combatants " and be denied some legal protections			1
almost all of the 800 detainees were held without charges			1
this legal limbo , as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment , spurred criticism of the facility popularly known as @entity88			0
@entity1 pledged to shut it down as part of his 2008 campaign , but saw his plans thwarted by opposition from @entity106 , which among other things prevented him from transferring remaining detainees to @entity10 prisons .			2

as many as 5 detainees are expected to be moved in the next few days , official says
news comes less than a week after 4 detainees were repatriated to @entity18
president @entity1 tells @entity2 he 's " going to be doing everything i can to close it . "
