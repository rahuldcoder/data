@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 , @entity1 is a small , picturesque town of just 18,400 inhabitants			1
the last time there was a royal visit here was a generation ago , in 1953 , when @entity8 and prince @entity9 came just after the @entity8 's coronation			1
locals still talk about that moment in local history , but now they have the next chapter			2
excitement about this weekend 's visit by @entity17 and @entity18 was on full display in the pretty high street			1
every other shop had been decorated with bunting and royal paraphernalia			2
it was as if everyone had rummaged through their drawers looking for anything royal or just @entity29 - related and turned it into a display			1
there was mannequin wearing a @entity35 flag apron and a tea cozy on her head ; tea caddies , tea cups , tea pots ; umbrellas , ornamental @entity44 phone boxes and buses			2
there was even a tattered guidebook from @entity48			2
acoustic @entity50 wave the night before the visit , excitement reached fever pitch			0
people started camping outside the town hall			1
by dawn saturday , the pavements were lined with well - wishers			1
people had come from as far away as @entity1 's capital , @entity60			1
by lunchtime , the population of the town had doubled			1
when we approached them with our camera , they cheered -- in fact if anything happened , they cheered			0
one teenager said she was a republican but had come here because of her mother who was a big royal fan			0
both got in the spirit of things with matching tiara hair grips			0
there 's always an eery calm before the royals actually turn up			1
the roads are cleared , security is locked down and then there is a pause before you hear -- then see -- police outriders			0
suddenly , the royal limo is right there before you			0
it 's inverted " @entity91 fever , " mums and daughters -- but with the mums shouting			1
in @entity0 , the royal convoy did a loop through the town and there was an acoustic @entity50 wave as the cheers followed them			1
as the couple pulled up at the town hall and got out , the cheers erupted into screams ... then a huge boo , which was odd			1
turns out a van had blocked the crowd 's view but was quickly moved on , allowing the screams to resume			1
@entity111 has n't been to @entity1 before and she wanted to meet as many people as possible , so " walkabouts " have been built into the schedule			1
@entity115 to royalist at the @entity119 , after meeting dignitaries and paying their respects at the war memorial , @entity17 and @entity18 crossed the road to the now heaving crowds			1
" i was here at half past two in the morning , " said one lady			0
" but this was an opportunity that i was not prepared to let go by any means of the imagination			0
i was going to be here come whatever			0
" after less than an hour , the royal visit was over			0
i spotted the royalist mother with her republican daughter			0
" how did you cope ? " i asked			0
" i know you were quite excited beforehand			0
" " i was , i went all gooey , " she said			2
" completely lost it but the good news is , i think i have converted my daughter to a royalist			0
" i put that to the daughter who said : " @entity138			0
" " that 's all it takes ? " i asked and she said ; " yep			2
" this royal tour must be sending shudders through the spine of the @entity1 republican movement			0
but we wo n't know what real impact it has had until the whirlwind is over , the window displays are back in the drawers and @entity1 have had a proper chance to consider whether the @entity157 are people they like to see -- or would like to reign .			2

the @entity17 and @entity18 and @entity160 are visiting @entity161 and @entity162

by lunchtime , the town 's population had doubled as people gathered to see them
there were scenes of screaming and one well - wisher described going " all gooey "
