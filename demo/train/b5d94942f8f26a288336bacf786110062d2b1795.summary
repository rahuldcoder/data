" there was never a malicious attempt to ' block ' the kids from talking with her , " @entity2 said			1
" we simply worried that a call home would first entail , or lead to , conversations with individuals we are in dispute with and that would , therefore , increase pressure on @entity151 -- and pressure was what a doctor said she did n't need			0
