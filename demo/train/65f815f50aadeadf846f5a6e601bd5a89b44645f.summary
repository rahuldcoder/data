@entity0 -- an avalanche , such as the one that killed at least eight climbers in @entity6 this weekend , is known in mountaineering circles as an objective hazard -- a risk that you can not control and one all climbers must accept			1
but with @entity12 playing host to some 231 mountaineers from 25 teams this season -- an unusually large number for the world 's eighth largest peak -- the natural disaster is likely to revive concerns about whether the @entity23 mountains favored by commercial expeditions are becoming too crowded			1
the avalanche was triggered by a huge piece of ice that fell from a glacier			2
it destroyed some 25 tents at one camp and survivors spoke of being swept hundreds of meters down the mountainside			0

" the devastation of the avalanche was certainly magnified by the number of people that were in its way , " he told @entity1			0
@entity53 , the former head of the @entity54 , said that avalanches on this scale were relatively rare on @entity12 , which was regarded as one of the easier 8,000m peaks to surmount			1
he said the accident was not connected to the number of climbers			1
" such avalanches are hard to predict			0
it all depends on the snow fall and how warm the ground is			0
" read more : @entity66 strikes climbers in @entity6 the problem of over-crowding is most stark at @entity70 , the world 's highest peak , which attracts hundreds of climbers each year eager to take a shot at the 8,848m ( 29,029 ft ) summit			1
in may this year , climbers spoke of " traffic jams " as more than 150 climbers waited their turn to summit the mountain during a window of good weather			1
the consequences were deadly as some climbers ' air supplies began to run out and frost bite began to set in			1
six climbers died in the space of two days			2
@entity90 , a @entity91 woman who made a successful summit on may 20 , said there were bodies attached to fixed lines and she had to walk around them			0
" there was a couple who were still alive , " she told @entity91 's @entity97			2
" our sherpa helped one of the people but a couple were so far gone they did n't even know we were there			0
it was the most horrendous thing to see			0
" a total of 10 climbers died on @entity70 in april and may , making it the third deadliest spring season on record after 12 people perished in 1996 and 11 in 2006			1
@entity45 , who spent april and may at @entity112 , attributes the high death toll to thrill - seeking amateurs , who are actively courted by cut - price outfitters			0
" if you really want to climb one of these mountains , you can pay someone to take you regardless of your experience level , " he said			0
" in the past 10 years , it 's gone from almost unheard of to happening more often			2
" @entity6 has eight of the 14 highest peaks in the world and tourism is a big earner for the landlocked country 's economy			1
september marks the beginning of the fall climbing season , which runs through november			0
unlike the spring season , which comes after a dry winter , the fall season follows the wet monsoon , coating the mountains in a lot more snow			0
this attracts mountaineer skiers like @entity139 , who survived sunday 's avalanche			2
the extreme sports celebrity had planned to ski down the mountain without the aid of oxygen			0
