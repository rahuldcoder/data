@entity0 , @entity1 -- the uptick in violence in @entity5 has prompted fears among @entity5 leaders and international powers that the tensions between @entity10 and @entity11 could escalate further and threaten to burst into full - blown sectarian war			1
who 's killing whom ? in some instances it 's @entity5 security forces clashing with gunmen			1
in others cases it seems to be pure sectarian violence targeting the civilian population in easy to reach targets to cause maximum damage ; to reignite divisions that never fully disappeared			0
why is this violence escalating ? after the @entity28 military withdrawal , sectarianism began to re-emerge with a vengeance , plus @entity30 in @entity5 and various other groups are trying to re-establish themselves and there is fallout from what 's happening in neighboring @entity35			2
for those closely following what has been happening in @entity5 , this is not a surprise			0
to a certain degree the @entity5 government and other parties have been trying to dial back these tensions , but some steps taken by the @entity5 government serve only to aggravate them			2
tensions are higher now than they have been for years			0
@entity5 's underlying problems have never been adequately addressed			0
there is a growing discontent within the @entity52 minority and a growing number demonstrations against the predominantly @entity11 government			2
and it 's all being aggravated by what 's happening in @entity35			0
what is the @entity58 ? there have been long tribal ties between @entity5 's @entity52 heartland and tribes in @entity35			1
those tribes feel they are being oppressed by @entity11 whether it 's the government in @entity5 or the @entity64 sect of @entity11 to which @entity35 's president @entity65 belongs			1
in some ways both nations are proxy battlefields for a longtime power struggle between @entity70 , with its @entity52 majority , and @entity11 - ruled @entity72 and their respective allies			1
at the same time @entity5 's @entity52 population has its own legitimate reasons for demonstrating against the government which have nothing to do with what is happening in @entity35			2
that being said , the conflict in @entity35 is throwing more fuel into an already burning fire			0
what is the state of the @entity5 security forces ? despite all the training they received from the @entity28 military they are still largely not properly trained to deal with the multi-layered challenges they face			1
additionally , @entity5 security forces are viewed by some as abusing their power ; viewed not as a national force protecting the country but as a force protecting the @entity11 government			1
and it does n't help that when driving through @entity101 you see @entity11 paraphernalia on the security checkpoints			0
there have been accusations of security forces targeting the @entity52 population			2
groups like @entity109 accused the @entity5 security forces of abusing their power and using too much force to quell @entity52 protests			1
what are the dynamics between @entity5 's @entity52 populations ? to simplify an incredibly complex situation some @entity10 enjoyed a number of advantages under @entity118 , which have completely slipped away during the rise of the @entity11 - led government			1
to @entity5 's detriment , the government from the onset was built upon religious identity -- sectarianism -- and has failed to develop into a nationalistic entity			0
@entity5 , which over the last decades has seen itself ripped apart , has yet to forge its own identity as a nation			0
today the country is -- as the @entity131 representative to @entity5 recently put it -- at a crossroads .			0

latest violence has led to fears of sectarian war in @entity5
@entity10 are feeling *marginalized* by @entity11 - led government
outside groups have accused @entity5 security forces of abusing their power
*historical* @entity52 ties to @entity35 adds to their feeling of oppression
