@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 gov. @entity3 announced tuesday he would not run for re-election next year and instead will seek the seat being vacated by retiring @entity7 sen. @entity6			1
gov. @entity3 appeared alongside sen. @entity9 , left , during the 2008 presidential campaign			1
@entity3 , who unsuccessfully ran for the @entity11 in 1998 , was immediately endorsed by the @entity11 @entity7 campaign arm , which hopes to avoid a bruising primary fight			1
former state house speaker @entity14 declared his intention last week to seek the @entity7 @entity11 nomination			1
" our country is facing the most profound public policy questions in our lifetime -- questions relating to the economy , taxes , healthcare , the environment and national security , " @entity3 said in a statement released by his campaign			1
" the answers to these questions will have a lasting impact on the country we love and the nation we will leave to our children and grandchildren			0
" he added in the statement : " here in @entity1 , we 've shown that when we put people first and work together , much can be accomplished , and i intend to bring that same approach to @entity37			0
that is why , after thoughtful consideration with my wife @entity40 , i have decided to run for the @entity11			0
" a @entity41 released last month showed @entity3 with a commanding 54 percent to 8 percent lead over @entity14 in the @entity7 primary			1
but the poll also found that more people overall , and @entity7 specifically , would rather see @entity3 run for re-election as governor than seek the @entity11 seat			1
should @entity3 backers persuade @entity14 to abandon his bid , it would help national republicans focus money and resources on other races in 2010			2
the @entity7 needs to win back seats they lost in 2008 to help weaken the @entity58 hold on the @entity11			2
@entity61 sen. @entity60 's decision to change his political affiliation from @entity7 to @entity63 and the increasing likelihood that @entity63 @entity65 will eventually be named the next senator from @entity67 means that president @entity68 will have enough @entity58 votes -- in theory -- for a filibuster - proof majority in the @entity11			2
last week , the @entity11 @entity7 was dealt a setback when former @entity61 gov. @entity73 , a popular @entity7 , decided not to challenge @entity60			1
but news that @entity3 would enter a @entity11 race was welcomed by @entity77 sen. @entity76 , who is chairman of the @entity78			0
" while i believe @entity14 has a very bright future within the @entity7 , @entity3 is the best candidate in 2010 to ensure that we maintain the checks and balances that @entity84 deserve in the @entity11 , " @entity76 said in a statement			1
" governor @entity3 is a dedicated public servant and a dynamic leader , and the @entity78 will provide our full support to ensure that he is elected the next @entity11 from @entity1			1
" @entity14 used a short blast on @entity89 to chastise the @entity78 for siding with @entity3 in the primary			0
" disappointed @entity7 senate comm endorses @entity3 on day 1 , " @entity14 wrote			1
" remember that reform must always come from the outside			0
status quo wo n't change itself			0
" @entity7 rep. @entity95 , who had been considering a @entity11 bid , instead said he would run for another term in the @entity98 and endorsed @entity3			1
anticipating his entry into the @entity11 race , the @entity99 last month aired its first television ad of the 2010 elections -- a small buy in the @entity0 tv market -- that accused @entity3 of running away from the state 's economic problems			2
@entity1 @entity58 echoed that line of criticism tuesday shortly after @entity3 declared his candidacy			2
" by running for @entity11 , @entity3 has cut and run on the @entity1 , once again taking the easy way out , avoiding responsibility and leaving the hard work of facing @entity1 's problems to the next governor , " @entity112 chair @entity111 said			1
" at a time when @entity1 needs real leadership , unfortunately @entity3 is running from the mess he created , which is why @entity84 are going to send @entity3 into retirement come @entity122			0
" still , @entity3 remains very popular in the state that he has led since he was elected governor in 2006			2
his approval rating is at 66 percent , according to the @entity41			0
while it had been speculated for weeks that @entity3 would run for the @entity11 , the governor told reporters tuesday that he made his final decision this past weekend to run for @entity6 's seat			1
with conservatives and centrists battling for control of the @entity7 , the upcoming primary contest in @entity1 will be closely watched nationally			0
@entity3 is considered a centrist , while @entity14 is trying to appeal to conservatives in the party			0
when asked to talk about his primary with @entity14 and the future direction of the @entity7 , @entity3 instead spoke about bipartisanship			2
" well , i think what 's important to bear in mind is that we do things a little bit differently here in @entity1 , and that 's another reason that i run for the @entity11 , " @entity3 told reporters at a news conference			1
" we work together to solve problems and do what 's right for the people of our state			0
the people are the boss			0
and i think regardless of party , we have to work together to get things done			0
and that 's what i 'd like to take to @entity37 " rep. @entity159 , @entity161 mayor @entity160 and state sen. @entity162 are all seeking the @entity58 @entity11 nomination			0
@entity2 's @entity164 and @entity165 contributed to this report .			0
