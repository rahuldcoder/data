@entity0 -- citing security concerns , the @entity2 has revoked the visas it recently issued to three @entity6 students who were awarded @entity8 scholarships to study in the @entity9			1
@entity10 , who advocates freedom of movement for @entity13 , says their access to education is restricted			1
it marks the second time in two months that the @entity9 has gone back on its offer to the @entity13 students to take part in the @entity9 government - sponsored scholarship program			1
the three students who had their visas revoked were sent a letter from the @entity27 in @entity0 , dated august 4			0
" the @entity2 has revoked your nonimmigrant visa " because " information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the @entity9 and ineligible to receive a visa under @entity32 ( a ) ( 3 ) of the @entity33 , which prohibits issuance of a visa to aliens for security and related grounds , " the letter said			2
the letter did not elaborate on what the security concerns were			2
a @entity2 official told @entity1 that the agency could not disclose any information about the reason for the visa revocation , but that the students would be allowed to reapply for a visa at some point in the future			2
the three students are among seven @entity6 - based @entity8 scholars who made headlines when in may the @entity2 sent them e-mail notifications saying their scholarships could not be completed because the @entity55 government would not issue them exit visas from @entity6			1
@entity2 spokesman @entity57 admitted that the @entity9 authorities had not taken up the matter with @entity55 until after the matter became public			2
the scholarships were only reinstated after secretary of state @entity62 expressed her unhappiness with the situation and the @entity2 spokesman admitted that a " faulty decision - making process " led to the communication			0
according to @entity10 , the executive - director of @entity69 , an @entity55 non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of movement for @entity13 and has been working closely with the students , four of the seven @entity8 students were cleared for travel out of @entity6 by @entity55 , but the remaining three were prevented from leaving @entity6 by the @entity55 government , citing security concerns			1
in an unusual move , the @entity27 in @entity0 processed the remaining three students ' visa applications with mobile fingerprinting equipment at the @entity55 - @entity6 border and granted the visas three weeks later at the end of july			1
@entity10 said on tuesday that one of the three students , @entity85 , had already left @entity6 for the @entity9 and upon arrival at the airport in @entity88 was informed that his visa had been revoked and was sent back to @entity90 , @entity91 , with instructions to return to @entity6			0
the other two @entity8 students remain in @entity6			0
@entity10 said that while the situation of the three students is one of " tremendous concern , " it only underscores what she says is the larger problem of lack of access to higher education for hundreds of @entity6 students who have been accepted into universities outside of @entity6 but are prevented from leaving due to @entity55 restrictions			1
@entity10 said that " alongside the few students denied visas for procedural , technical , or undisclosed security reasons , there are hundreds of students with valid visas in danger of losing their places at foreign universities because @entity55 refuses to even consider their requests to leave @entity6			1
" denying talented young people their right to access education does not contribute to building a better future in the region , " @entity10 said			0
@entity55 government officials have long maintained that its restrictions on allowing students to travel outside of @entity6 are based only on security considerations			1
" we do act to facilitate students wishing to study at @entity130 universities where they are exposed to liberal and democratic values , " an @entity55 government official said on tuesday			0
but , the official said , @entity55 distinguishes between students wanting to study in the @entity134 and those wanting to study in places like @entity137 , @entity138 or @entity139 or the @entity140			0
in the case of the @entity140 , the official said @entity143 could use this as a way of strengthening its activist base in the @entity140 , which would be detrimental to @entity55 's security			0
" there is no reason why we should do that , " the @entity55 official said			0
on the matter of the three students , the official said : " the process of @entity55 - @entity9 contacts on the matter did not cease , and more specific information was provided			0
