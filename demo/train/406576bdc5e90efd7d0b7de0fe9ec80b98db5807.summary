-- inspectors overseeing the destruction of @entity6 's chemical weapons have visited 21 of the 23 sites they want to inspect by a friday deadline , but security concerns have prevented visits to the remaining two , the world 's chemical weapons watchdog said monday			1
" efforts ... to ensure the conditions necessary for safe access to those sites will continue , " the @entity11 said in a statement released monday			0
@entity11 spokesman @entity17 added that the two remaining sites are in areas contested by government forces and opposition militants -- part of a conflict that has raged in the country since 2011			0
a joint @entity11 - @entity26 team is overseeing @entity6 's efforts to destroy its chemical weapons , which the country agreed to do earlier this year under international pressure			1
the @entity32 resolution gives @entity6 until mid- 2014 to destroy that arsenal , and charges inspectors with completing their initial inspections of all @entity6 chemical weapons and storage facilities by november 1			1
but @entity6 's civil war presents inspectors with significant challenges , including having to cross front lines and move through areas controlled by rebels			1
the @entity11 previously has said that cooperation by rebels , in the form of temporary cease - fires to allow inspectors safe passage , would be key if deadlines are to be met			0
@entity17 said monday that the @entity26 is negotiating for the inspectors ' safe passage to the two remaining sites			2
the inspectors will be deployed as soon as their safety is guaranteed , he said			0
monday 's statement by the @entity11 came a day after the group said @entity6 met its sunday deadline for submitting a plan to get rid of the chemical weapons			1
@entity59 disclosed the 23 sites earlier this year			0
on august 21 a chemical attack outside @entity59 led the @entity62 and its allies to call for military intervention in @entity6 's civil war -- a situation that was defused in mid-september , when @entity59 agreed to a @entity62 - @entity67 plan to give up its chemical weapons stockpile			1
but the @entity6 opposition has protested that the @entity6 government has done nothing to stop the killing of civilians using conventional weapons			0
according to the @entity26 , more than 100,000 people have died in the @entity6 conflict			2
it began in march 2011 when government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the @entity81 movement and has morphed into a full - blown civil war			2
a proposed conference in @entity84 , @entity85 , between @entity6 government officials and opposition leaders , intended to broker an end to the war , has been delayed several times , but is tentatively scheduled for the end of november .			0
