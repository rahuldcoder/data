-- @entity2 ' latest album is supposed to be intimate , but it 's left a number of critics cold			1
the 32 - year - old singer 's eighth record , " @entity5 , " was officially released on tuesday after streaming on @entity7 for the past week			1
as early reactions indicated , " @entity5 " is n't quite as warm and inviting as @entity2 has made it sound			1
" i poured my heart and soul into this album , " @entity2 told her fans in an open letter on her website			1
" i know i keep telling you it is my most personal record yet , but it 's true and i 'm really proud of that			0
i have been through a lot in the past few years and it has really inspired me to dig deeper and write songs that i think everyone can relate to			0
" yet to @entity25 , which gave the album a b + grade , " @entity5 " " tells you virtually bupkus about her struggles over the years			2
but in just 10 tidy songs , it brings us closer than ever before to that distant dreamer			0
" the @entity31 was n't as gentle in its review , finding that the ironic lack of intimacy on " @entity5 " makes the disc " instantly forgettable			2
" " the result is n't remotely personal , does n't venture much beyond the usual @entity2 themes -- fame is confusing , sex is fun , i am a totally normal person with the same worries as you , let 's dance -- and will do nothing to reassure anyone that the once familiar , pre- 2007 @entity2 is in there anywhere , " the review says			2
the @entity48 agrees , dismissing " @entity5 " as @entity2 ' " most disappointing release yet , a snoozefest of shallow mid-tempos and limp club tracks that chase trends rather than invent them			1
and the glimpses into @entity2 , the artist , are , frankly , neither interesting nor informative			0
" the @entity56 warns that " whatever unique skills @entity2 once had -- what were they again , anyway ? -- ' @entity5 ' suggests she better prepare herself for the reality that she 's losing them fast			1
... there 's very little beneath the album 's many cliches to suggest insight , let alone the unfiltered honesty of autobiography			0
" that said , if you 're a fan of post- 2007 @entity2 , which includes the smash album " @entity72 , " then " @entity5 " might be your cup of dance - pop tea			1
@entity75 gave @entity2 ' effort three - and - a - half stars , appraising " @entity5 " as continuing " the roll she 's been on in recent years			1
... like her excellent late - summer electro - sleaze hit , ' @entity80 * * * h , ' ' @entity5 ' adds up the high price of stardom			0
it 's a concept album about the loneliness of pop life -- with a high - profile broken engagement behind her , @entity2 gets personal and drops her most bummed - out music ever			2
" @entity91 , too , was able to see the heart underneath the driving beat			0
" most of the tracks sound like a wild night out , " the network said in an early review			0
but added " it 's when you dig under all the reverb and @entity101 beats that you hear that ' @entity5 ' really is coming from her heart -- one beating at 500 miles an hour			0

@entity2 ' eighth *studio* album was released on *december* 3
the record , " @entity5 , " is intended to be more intimate
yet some critics have found the disc to be *impenetrable*
