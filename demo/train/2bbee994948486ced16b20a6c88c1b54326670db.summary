-- the streak of light that blazed across southwestern @entity6 skies and stoked burning curiosity across the social media landscape was probably a tiny and bright meteor known as a fireball , a @entity2 spokeswoman said thursday			1
@entity11 , spokeswoman at @entity2 's @entity12 , called it a rarely seen and exciting treat for the legions of people who glanced to the heavens on wednesday night			1
law enforcement and media in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 were fielding calls of the reported sighting			1
it quickly became a hot topic on a number of social media websites with most asking , " did you see it ? what was that ? " " for all the millions of people that called , they can scratch that off their bucket list			1
they are very lucky to see a fireball , " @entity11 said			1
@entity11 told @entity0 the object eyeballed in the sky on wednesday night was probably the size of a baseball or a basketball , based on descriptions reported to police and across the internet			1
the fireball was a tiny chunk of an asteroid that became a meteor when it hit the atmosphere , @entity11 said			1
while it probably incinerated before it reached ground , it 's not impossible that a pebble - sized meteorite survived the trip			2
@entity11 said such small objects pose no danger but noted that scientists are regularly keeping their eyes on asteroids that could cause issues			2
" fireballs are actually extremely common , " she said			2
" they happen every day somewhere over our globe			2
" many officials initially theorized the object was a meteor			1
lt. @entity71 of the @entity72 in @entity73 was trying to guess what the strange light was and said he believes " it was a meteorite travelling from north to south across @entity77			1
he said the 911 call center received a flood of calls , but there were no reports of impact or damage			1
" people are , indeed , reporting they saw a light head from west to east across the sky			2
we got reports from @entity90 and the @entity91 about callers seeing the light			0
it is reasonable to say that it may be a meteor , " @entity94 , a meteorologist with the @entity95 , told @entity0 affiliate @entity96			0
there were no reports of aircraft incidents across @entity103 , @entity104 , a @entity91 , spokesman said			0
@entity2 officials have announced the now - defunct @entity107 is expected to fall back to @entity108 in the coming weeks , but that is expected to happen in a week to 10 days , @entity2 spokesman @entity105 said			0
fireballs generally go unnoticed because they whiz over oceans and uninhabited regions , according to the @entity113			0
also , the society said , " those that occur at night also stand little chance of being detected due to the relatively low numbers of persons out to notice them			0
" but they can grab attention when they streak during the evening hours above a highly populated area			0
the society says " the brighter the fireball , the more rare is the event			0
" @entity11 said , " we think everybody should have the opportunity to see a fireball			0
" @entity0 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
