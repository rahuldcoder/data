-- standing atop a craggy , coastal outcrop on the outskirts of @entity4 , @entity1 checks his footing before adopting a statuesque pose reminiscent of a @entity9 warrior			1
with chest puffed out and a javelin at his side , the 35 - year - old 's stance has a classical feel , but with a distinctly modern twist			1
in the dying light of a frigid november day in the @entity21 capital , the jagged silhouette of a carbon fiber running blade can be made out before its tip trails into the inky murk beneath			1
the prosthetic limb has helped @entity1 become one of the most successful para-athletes of recent times propelling him to the top of the podium in the javelin over the last two seasons			1
at the 2013 world championships in @entity33 , @entity34 , he took gold and repeated the feat earlier this year at the @entity37 with a winning throw of 50.74 meters competing in the @entity40 class -- a category for athletes who have suffered amputations above the knee			2
" i just love everything about the javelin , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity46			1
" it 's just the feeling when you hit the sweet spot -- when you 're throwing a perfect throw , there 's nothing that compares to that ... it 's the perfect feeling			2
" like most @entity58 competitors , @entity1 has had plenty thrown at him during his life			1
a talented handball player in his youth , @entity1 looked to be heading for the professional ranks when , on the cusp of adulthood , his life took an abrupt and tragic turn			1
" i was 18 years old when i started feeling little bits of pain in my leg			2
and then the pain got worse , and worse , and worse , " he explains			2
a period of agonizing limbo involving hospital visits , tests and scans came to a horrifying conclusion with a diagnosis of bone cancer			1
he embarked upon a course of chemotherapy but after five months of treatment the tumor showed no signs of shrinking and the decision was made to amputate his left leg above the knee in 1999			1
he was 19 years old			0
" i just thought to myself : ' now the professional sports dream that i have is out the window			2
' so i had to do something else , " he says			0
@entity1 exchanged the fast - paced action of the handball court for more gentle pursuits like golf and fishing			1
understandably , given his circumstances , he lost interest in keeping fit and piled on the pounds during his 20s			0
but when he took a job in r&d at the @entity21 prosthetics company @entity102 in 2009 , it was n't long before his competitive spark was reignited and his sporting career resumed with a flourish			1
based in @entity4 , @entity102 has forged a global reputation as a leading manufacturer and developer of prosthetic knees , legs and feet			1
their carbon fiber running blades were famously worn by the @entity113 and dozens of other para-athletes around the world use their equipment today			1
" @entity102 has been my inspiration for the things i am doing today			1
to be able to be around and talk to the biggest names in @entity58 sports made me want to do it			2
i have a lot to thank them for , " he said			0
" to be able to run again at the level i am doing , it 's just unbelievable			0
this is one of the best inventions ever , " he says pointing down to his carbon fiber blade			0
at first , @entity1 used it exclusively for sprinting , competing in the 100m , before also taking up the long jump , but his true calling came a little later , more by happy accident than choice			1
" i was warming up for the long jump and i saw a javelin lying on the grass			2
so i picked it up , tried one throw and that was my thing			0
the old handball shoulder was back , " he said , noting the similarity in the throwing techniques of the two sports			1
" it 's pretty much the same rhythm			0
in the javelin , you ( have a ) fast approach until you stop and throw and it 's just the same thing in handball			1
" his first ever throw surpassed the @entity156 qualifying standard by six meters , and he currently has a personal best of 51.83 meters -- just under a meter off the world record held by @entity162 thrower @entity161			0
it 's a distance that 's well within his reach , the @entity21 reckons			1
" i 've been doing this almost three years and i 've got so much inside that i want to get out before i stop			0
i want to be the first amputee to throw over 60m , " he says			0
at this time of year , particularly in @entity21 's long , drawn out winters , it 's more about knuckling down to training than record attempts with @entity1 focusing on his technique and keeping the body strong			1
" you have to train every single muscle in your body to be able to cope with what you are doing			0
i am amputated on the left side ... so i have to train that little bit harder to make these muscle groups a little bit stronger			2
" next year promises to be another banner year with @entity1 looking to defend his world crown in @entity182 , @entity183			2
but 2016 is already on his mind when @entity185 will host the 15th @entity186			0
" my future dreams are to make the grand slam -- to be world champion , @entity191 champion and @entity193 champion			0
" i want to be the best , always			0
there 's nothing else that i 'm thinking about			0
i want to be the guy that everyone wants to beat			0
" whatever the future holds , @entity1 hopes to continue being the living embodiment of his life motto			2
" never give up , " he says			0
" you can always do something			0
