-- pressure is mounting on republicans to address spreading public protests against @entity4			1
how they answer could shape the political landscape from here to the november elections			0
@entity2 have n't had to pay much attention to @entity10 till now -- they could afford to sniff that the crowds in @entity12 looked more like @entity13 than @entity4			1
but as demonstrations have sprung up across the @entity16 and @entity17 , reverberating through social media and gaining more serious attention from mainstream media , politicians must pay more attention			2
president @entity22 and fellow @entity23 have already leapt to the support of protesters			2
the cries of frustration and anger from the streets dovetail perfectly with the president 's own shift leftward , populist stance , efforts to blame the rich for @entity16 's economic woes , and demands that they pay higher taxes			1
so perfect is the fit that some conservatives suspect that @entity23 partisans are quietly fueling the protests			2
there are legitimate questions as to whether the president is ill serving the national interest by whipping up antagonism toward the wealthy , especially the financial services industry			0
until recently , many influential @entity23 ( such as sen. @entity48 ) joined @entity2 in believing that @entity4 , serving as the financial capital of the world , was one of the nation 's top assets			1
yes , it became too greedy and reckless and needed tougher government scrutiny , but its vitality should be preserved			0
soon after taking office , @entity22 summoned bankers and told them he was all that was standing between them and people with pitchforks			0
today , many in @entity64 believe the president has now taken up a pitchfork himself			0
what impact this alienation will have on voting behavior remains uncertain , but clearly , the president and his team believe it will help them in 2012			0
what better way to change the storyline for the elections ? @entity4 demonstrations start second month that raises the question : how will @entity2 rise to the challenge ? how will they frame the argument about the protesters and their underlying issues ? some in the @entity2 hope the protesters will disappear with the first frost , taking the controversy with them			1
perhaps that will happen : they are not as well - organized nor do they have as clear an agenda as the tea partiers , so they may not be able to sustain themselves			0
even if the protesters melt away , however , it appears they have already achieved an important goal : they have put income inequality on the national agenda			1
yawning gaps between the top 1 % versus the other 99 % have been simmering as a political issue for a long time , stretching back before the @entity100			1
but most middle - class @entity16 have n't seriously objected , whether because their sense of their current income was skewed , or because they expected they 'd strike it rich one day themselves			1
( one poll from 2000 showed that no less than 19 % considered themselves in the top 1 % -- and another 20 % on top of that expected they would be soon			1
) all that has changed now			0
most @entity16 feel stuck , they think their kids will be worse off than they are , and they are increasingly angry			1
a @entity115 poll this week found that by 54 % to 23 % , the public approves of protests on @entity4 and beyond ; by contrast , opinion about the tea party now runs 33 % negative versus 27 % positive			1
so the @entity2 likely ca n't duck addressing inequality			1
@entity123 last week voiced sympathy for those protesting who are truly suffering			0
but one would think that @entity2 candidates would go well beyond and frankly recognize , as @entity128 and some other @entity2 have , that massive inequality and a lack of upward mobility are destructive to a democracy			1
perhaps they do n't agree , but if so , they are living in a darker past than we all thought			0
the evidence of yawning inequalities is now plentiful			0
here are just a few factoids : -- between 1977 and 2007 , the top 1 % earners ' share of national income jumped from roughly 9 % to 23.5 % , a level only bested once in our history -- in 1928			1
-- the ceo - to - worker pay ratio has also skyrocketed : at the start of the 1980s , @entity146 made roughly 40 times as much as bottom - rung workers ; by 2010 , they took home between 300 and 400 times as much			0
-- the divergence is even greater among the super-rich : the top 0.1 % ( roughly 150,000 families ) now make roughly 10 % of the nation 's total income -- so they 're pulling away even from the rest of the rich themselves			1
these stats are jarring , but they 're not enough			0
if poor @entity16 had a nickel for every statistic that 's been trotted out to diagnose the issue in the past year , we would n't have to worry about income inequality anymore			1
the hard question -- now put to the @entity2 free marketers , who have owned the political dialogue of late -- is what to do to narrow the inequality gap			1
presumably -- and this is a logical position -- @entity2 candidates would oppose lowering the ceiling on the rich , preferring to lift the floor for everyone else			2
but that is easier said than done			0
first of all , even our most optimistic economists are not projecting anything above fairly modest growth over the next few years -- no game changers there			0
but moreover , to fall back on the single mantra of more growth as the elixir simply does n't hack it anymore : in the new normal , a rising tide does n't lift all boats			1
with massive structural changes like globalization and technology reorienting the economy , many -- particularly in rich , developed countries like our own -- find themselves mired in the mud , while others have super-duper motors that let them run off into the sunset			0
so , what 's a good @entity2 to do to lift floors ? @entity197 forbid , some forms of government intervention may actually be necessary			2
that 's , at least , what @entity200 concluded			0
he became a champion of an earned income tax credit , helping to raise the income of people willing to work for meager wages			2
@entity208 expanded the @entity200 program and it proved a powerful tool in closing the inequality gap in the mid- 90s			2
if @entity200 and @entity208 could agree on a successful tactic to help more families enter the middle class , ca n't today 's @entity2 come up with imaginative new approaches ? the issue , as most of us agree , is not really inequality so much as it is mobility , or opportunity			2
the vast majority of @entity16 -- and the presidential hopefuls on stage are certainly among them -- do n't want to live in a society where everyone is held equally low ; they want to live in a society where everyone has a fair opportunity to climb high			2
that 's a moral issue as much as economic one , and our political leaders are ultimately judged not just by the way they lift the gdp , but by the way they lift the moral life of their country			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

writers : @entity2 has ignored occupy @entity4 so far , but it has to tackle those issues
@entity23 have taken on the populist notion of income inequality , they say
@entity16 getting more angry with huge gap between the top 1 % versus the 99 % , they say
writers : @entity2 must address inequality , face reality that rising tide no longer lifts all boats
