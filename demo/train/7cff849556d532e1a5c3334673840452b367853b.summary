@entity1 , @entity0 -- lawyers representing @entity5 members in a jailbreak case that includes former @entity0 president @entity7 called saturday for the judges to be changed			1
as has been the case in previous proceedings , @entity7 appeared in the courtroom from inside a soundproof glass box , a requirement he rejected last sunday as a " farce			1
" he and a number of leaders of the @entity5 , which continues to back him , were present in the courtroom where they face prison - break charges stemming from the january 2011 uprising			0
on saturday , one of the defense lawyers said the glass enclosure should either be removed or the defendants should be given a sign language expert -- and time to learn sign language -- before proceedings continue so they can communicate with their lawyers in private , as the law requires they be allowed to do			1
the three - judge panel 's refusal led to the request that they be changed			1
typically , another judge or panel would look into the demand for change , though it was not clear saturday which judicial district would do so			2
judge @entity40 adjourned the case until monday			0
" the glass dock is to humiliate the defendants , " @entity42 , the lead attorney , said sunday			1
" this is unprecedented in the world			0
" a glitch in the sound system that had allegedly made it difficult for defendants sunday to hear what was going on in the courtroom appeared to have been repaired by saturday			2
during saturday 's proceeding , defense lawyer @entity53 filed a complaint against what he described as crimes committed by the military leaders of last year 's coup , in which the nation 's first democratically elected president was deposed			2
as @entity53 ticked off the coup leaders ' alleged crimes -- among them obstruction of the constitution and staging the coup -- @entity7 added " and for killing over 3,000 people " in sit - ins			1
@entity53 continued , " and for the ongoing killings in the face of peaceful protests			0
" he called for an investigation into the crimes " to stop the ongoing bloodshed			0
" another defense lawyer , @entity76 , called for the case against @entity7 and the others to be dismissed " because it was borne out of the womb of the counterrevolution that happened on july 3			1
" that was a reference to @entity7 's removal last year from the presidency and by gen. @entity84			1
most of the leaders of the january 25 , 2011 , revolution that toppled longtime strongman @entity90 and led to @entity7 's election the following year , especially @entity92 , " have been thrown into prison with fictitious evidence , " @entity76 said			1
he called the continuing legal wrangling an attempt to uproot the @entity5 and to " uphold the foundation of the counterrevolution and military dictatorship			0
" but the prosecution objected to the arguments , describing them as political and irrelevant to the case			0
the defense attorneys ' arguments were all about " the country , the political scene and targeted messages , " the prosecutor said			0
" the prosecution has no right to object , " responded defense attorney @entity108 , who requested that the judges overseeing the case be changed			2
it is his right to say things that the prosecutor may not understand , but which could prove useful later in the case , he said			0
@entity7 himself was allowed to speak twice			1
" farces take place in your presence , " he said in remarks directed to the judge that were referring to a recording leaked to the news media of what he had thought was a private conversation between him and his lawyer			0
he maintained that he remains the country 's legitimate president and called upon the people of @entity0 to continue " their peaceful revolution			2
" " people are aware of the truth behind the coup , " @entity7 said			1
@entity7 repeated his earlier assertion that the court proceeding was unconstitutional , describing it in @entity140 as " null and void			1
" @entity7 has been charged with inciting the killings of political opponents and organizing a 2011 jailbreak by members of his then - banned @entity5			1
@entity7 , the former head of the @entity5 's political arm , won office in 2012			2
shortly after he was elected , he resigned from the @entity5 and its @entity148 in an effort to show he would represent all @entity0			0
but he was ousted in a coup a year later amid widespread protests against his rule , with opponents accusing him of pursuing an @entity92 agenda and excluding other factions from the government			0
@entity7 and other @entity5 leaders were rounded up after the coup			1
the @entity5 had long been suppressed during the 29 - year rule of @entity90			0
but it emerged as the most powerful political force in @entity0 after the popular revolt that toppled @entity90 in 2011			0
rights groups and other pundits say the military - backed government that replaced @entity7 has returned to the authoritarian practices of @entity90 , if not worse .			2

glass enclosure should be removed or defendants allowed to learn sign language , lawyers say
the judges ' refusal of that request led to the lawyers ' demand that they be removed
" people are aware of the truth behind the coup , " @entity7 says
