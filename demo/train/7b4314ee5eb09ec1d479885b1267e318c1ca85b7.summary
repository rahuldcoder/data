@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 , @entity3 , now known as the " kissing congressman " after the married father of five was caught on surveillance tape making out with a staffer who is also married , says his affair , despite his @entity10 conservative political platform , will not sideline his new political career			1
he said he will run for reelection unless " an outcry " of opposition persuades him not to			2
the fate of cheating politicians is a mixed bag			2
some survive and some do n't			1
@entity21 and numerous other members of @entity23 did not , forced to resign or not seek reelection			0
but this story is n't about them			1
it 's about the women who are the other half of politicians ' extramarital affairs			1
and in many instances , when high - profile politicians cheat , their mistresses have a harder time recovering			0
here 's a look at where some of them are now : @entity39 : the latest " other woman " in a political affair is the staffer caught kissing @entity2			1

years later , @entity49 is still " trying " to live a normal life			1
after a brief stint in the spotlight after @entity20 's impeachment , the former @entity55 intern has lived in relative obscurity			1
@entity60 : one - time vice presidential nominee @entity62 has moved on since his 2008 affair with @entity64 broke up his marriage , sunk his presidential campaign and bore a child			0
he recently started practicing law again			0
@entity64 , on the other hand , has not had the same good fortune			0
she recently released an updated version of the book about the affair in which she apologizes for her behavior -- that included writing a book that " hurt more people			0
" @entity79 : she was involved with former @entity81 sen. @entity80			0
both @entity79 and her husband , @entity82 , worked for @entity80			0
after he fired them in 2008 , while the affair was going on , he paid them nearly $ 100,000 and found lobbying work for @entity87			0
@entity80 resigned from his @entity89 post three weeks before an ethics report was to be released and has gone back to his life as a veterinarian in @entity93 , where he said he has been " humbled			2
" " i used to own this practice , now i 'm working for somebody			2
that 's sometimes a very healthy thing to happen in life , " @entity80 told @entity1 's @entity96 last year			1
as for @entity87 , the @entity100 reported in 2011 that she filed for bankruptcy , left @entity93 and moved to @entity103 to work for a @entity10 organization			0
but not all affairs end badly for the woman involved : @entity107 : she is the @entity109 woman with whom former @entity111 governor @entity110 was with when he disappeared for four days in 2011			2
