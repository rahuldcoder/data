-- many said he only left @entity2 for the money			0
after all , he reportedly earns more than $ 300,000 a week in @entity4			2
why else would you leave the world 's most successful club ? @entity8 , however , insists that he came to @entity9 in 2010 for one reason -- to make history			1
he could be proved right on sunday , when @entity9 's expensively - assembled squad have the chance to win a first @entity14 in 44 years			1
such a success is but a small part of the dream held by the @entity21 club 's @entity19 owners , and @entity8 -- who last season ended @entity9 's 35 - year wait for a trophy by scoring the only goal of the @entity27 final -- is a key figure in their master plan			1
" when @entity9 wanted to sign me from @entity2 , they were thinking about bringing a good player to try to add to the club and make history in four years , " the @entity33 international told @entity0			1
" i think this is very interesting for me and for the club because i think they 've made the right choice			0
we gained a couple of fantastic players , this year we 're doing fantastically well			0
we have one more game , a very difficult game against @entity46 , although we hope we will win this game because it is very important			0
" " @entity52 " perhaps does not do justice to sunday 's home match against a @entity46 team battling to avoid relegation			0
@entity9 top the table from defending champions and fierce local rivals @entity56 by goal difference alone			2
if both teams have the same result this weekend then it will be the closest finish to an @entity4 season since @entity63 pipped @entity64 to the title in 1989 on number of goals scored			1
but perhaps even more crucially , it will tip the balance of power away from @entity56 -- a club seeking a record - extending 20th league crown			2
" if you want to make history you have to win , " @entity8 said			1
" last year we did it when we won the @entity27 , and this year with the signings we have i think we have to win something for this club			2
" the fans were amazing this year , incredible , and they helped us a lot in difficult moments and good moments , so i think we 've done everything for them			0
if we can win this title i think it will be for the fans and for the club			1
" @entity9 thrashed @entity56 6 - 1 at @entity88 in october as @entity90 's men led the table by five points , but @entity94 's side bounced back to move eight points clear at the top with six games to go			1
@entity9 struggled in the wake of @entity100 's fallout with @entity90 , a controversy that saw the club 's former captain and top scorer go missing for three months			1
just as crucially , @entity8 was away for six weeks at the @entity105 , depriving @entity9 's midfield of its driving force			1
add to that the on and off - field indiscretions of @entity109 , and it appeared that @entity9 's stars were shooting themselves in the foot			1
" sometimes it 's difficult because when you have an important , quality player like that and they make something wrong , sometimes it 's difficult because football is a game for all the group , " @entity8 said			1
" it 's 11 players , 45 players who live together , you see each other more than you see your family , and you have to be careful because when one of your teammates is wrong it can affect almost all the other players			0
" but i think this year we dealt with everything			0
@entity100 is a fantastic player who we always hoped would come back because he is a really important player for us			2
yeah he made a mistake but he 's apologized to everyone and he 's showed to the fans he 's there to fight for his friends for the title			2
" @entity90 has been criticized for his management methods since coming to @entity4 from @entity143 champions @entity142 in mid- 2009 , but @entity8 credits him for inspiring belief that the title race was not over			1
" when i was coming to @entity9 , it was @entity90 taking me there			2
he believes in me ... when i was playing with @entity147 he sent someone to look at me because last time he wanted to bring me to @entity142 because he was there , " @entity8 said			0
" i think the key was when @entity90 started making a speech in the dressing room and said , ' guys we do n't have to give up because the @entity21 is like that and maybe they can drop some points and we can come back			0
we have to believe to the end because we 're in the most competitive competition in the world and most importantly we have to keep going , keep winning and maybe we 'll be close to them			0
' " i think @entity90 was totally right because we never gave up and we continued to fight to the final , and now we have the same points , it 's unbelievable			0
" next season @entity9 will play in the @entity164 for the second successive time			0
their introduction this season will always be remembered for @entity100 's clash with @entity90 in @entity169 , which precipitated a group - stage exit from @entity172 's premier club tournament			1
@entity8 has already held that trophy aloft , in 2009 when @entity2 completed a treble of trophies also including the @entity177 league and cup crowns			0
" the @entity164 is one of the biggest competitions in the world , it 's very tough and all the best teams in the world play in this competition , " @entity8 said			1
" yes i 've already won it but i 've said i came to @entity9 to make history and most importantly i have to keep working hard and make me believe i can be part of history at this amazing club			1
" it 's going to be tough but i think we 're on a good way to being a big team			0
" @entity195 won @entity9 's group and went on to reach the may 19 final , which will be held at the @entity200 team 's home stadium			1
@entity4 will be represented by @entity201 , who overcame considerable odds to beat defending champions @entity2 in the semis			0
" it 's going to be tough because @entity195 is a fantastic team			0
two years ago they lost ( the final ) against @entity142 , but i think @entity201 are doing extremely well , they are fighting together , " @entity8 said			2
" it 's going to be tough for them because @entity195 have not stopped winning			0
but i hope an @entity4 team can win and the guys can say the @entity21 is one of the toughest competitions in the world			2
