" we believe this is a direct response ( to the argument ) from ms. @entity13 , " he said			1

" however , he said , " this was n't a hardened criminal			0
this was a young lady in trouble , in trouble in more ways than she realized			0

she drove them to the river while " trying to find a way to discard the bodies , " he said			2
" she just wanted to get rid of the children , as sad as it may be , " @entity19 said			2
authorities do not know how long the boys had been dead before they went into the water , he said			1

she said she was at home around the time @entity13 told authorities she lost control of her car			1

" i do n't believe she woke up and said , ' i 'm going to the @entity148 to get rid of my children , ' " he said			0
" of course , that has n't been determined			0
i believe she was just angry , upset and for some reason found the boat ramp , but mind you the children were deceased ... so ( she was ) trying to find a way to discard the bodies			1
" the father of the two children has not been found , @entity19 said			1
@entity13 " was more or less being mother and father for the children , " he said			1

she stuck to that story for nine days , issuing tearful pleas for her sons ' return on national media outlets , before confessing to authorities			0

never in trouble with our boss			0
she left because she chose to			0
