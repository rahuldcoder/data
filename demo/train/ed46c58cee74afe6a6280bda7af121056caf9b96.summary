@entity2 student leaders will meet with @entity2 government representatives tuesday , the first time the two sides have met since pro-democracy protesters took to the streets of the city more than three weeks ago			1
but while the talks present the best chance for a peaceful resolution to the chaotic demonstrations that have convulsed the city and divided its residents , they are unlikely to yield major concessions given that the government and protest leaders remain poles apart			1
" the start of talks is not an end in itself , " said @entity18 , a former senior government official			1
" only the government can break the current impasse			0
it must show the leadership that has been totally lacking in the past three weeks , by coming to the table with proposals that offer genuine and substantial reform			0
" but this seems unlikely			0
@entity29 unlikely to budge @entity2 chief executive @entity30 has said repeatedly that he would not step down -- a key demand of protesters			1
nor , @entity30 has said , is @entity29 unlikely to budge on its prescription for electoral reform in the city and offer the kind of democracy protesters are seeking			2
even the moderator of the talks , @entity40 president @entity39 , warned not to expect too much : " i 'm not going to speculate at all about whether there will be a resolution , " he said on monday , adding that this would not be the only round of talks			2
five representatives from the @entity49 including @entity50 , the group 's secretary general , and his deputy @entity52 will meet with chief secretary @entity53 , @entity2 's second in command , justice secretary @entity56 and three other senior government officials or advisers			1
the talks begin at 6 p.m. local time and will be broadcast live from the @entity61 in an event that will likely have the city 's seven million residents gripped			1
some say they will hold viewing parties and the talks will be live - streamed to crowds on big screens set up in some areas -- including @entity71 , a busy commercial district that has seen some of the most violent confrontations between demonstrators , police and residents that oppose the protests			2
poor ca n't be trusted ? on monday , @entity30 offered a controversial defense of @entity29 's plan for elections in the financial capital , telling foreign media that an open nomination process would give the city 's poorest residents greater influence over the political system			0
" you have to take care of all the sectors in @entity2 as much as you can , " he said , according to the @entity89			0
" and if it 's entirely a numbers game and numeric representation , then obviously you would be talking to half of the people in @entity2 who earn less than $ 1,800 a month			2
" then you would end up with that kind of politics and policies			0
" his comments are likely to rankle the protesters and their sympathizers given @entity2 's yawning wealth gap and a widespread perception that the current system of government is stacked against ordinary citizens			1
wiggle room one possible concession the government could make to immediately defuse tensions would be to re-open @entity113 -- a fenced off courtyard outside central government headquarters that students stormed at the end of september , triggering the unprecedented protests			2
there is also still some possibility of give - and - take on electoral reform , such as allowing more democrats on the nomination committee or by promising to introduce greater democracy in elections slated in 2022			0
the framework proposed for the election of the city 's next leader in 2017 will allow registered voters to select their leader , although candidates must be approved by a committee that critics say will be stacked with @entity29 loyalists and not be representative of @entity2			1
currently , the chief executive is elected by a specially - appointed 1,200 - member election committee			0
however , even if the talks yield concrete concessions , there is no guarantee that the protesters on the streets will go home			1
there are several protest groups and it 's not always clear who calls the shots or whether @entity2 's young protesters will listen			1
" i would want @entity30 to step down and for the government to show that they are sincere , " protester @entity152 told @entity1			0
@entity1 's @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity159 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
