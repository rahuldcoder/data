@entity0 please be more like sheep			1
believe it or not , that 's the @entity5 message for the people of @entity0 from the city 's leader @entity7			1
" in the coming year , i hope that all people in @entity0 will take inspiration from the sheep 's character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for @entity0 's future , " he said			1
@entity0 's leader is hoping his flock wo n't rock the boat after one very tumultuous year			1
for 79 days in late 2014 , student - led protests for democratic open elections took over major streets in the heart of the city			2
it was the biggest political challenge to @entity25 since the 1989 @entity27 protests			0
and while the @entity29 , so named after umbrellas were used to shield protesters from the tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police , is no longer blocking the roads , @entity0 's young protesters have vowed to return in force in the @entity37			1
" i believe within this year they will have a new act , they will have occupy action or civil disobedience again , " says @entity38 , the teenage face of the occupy protests and co-founder of the student activist group @entity42			1
" and occupy action will be happening more often in the future			0
" as pledged in their " we 'll be back " slogans at the end of the protest in december , the demonstrators plan to return and will once again rely on the civil disobedience tactics that eventually turned public opinion against them			1
" it 's the only way i see now that will actually give pressure to the government because you are actually blocking the roads , causing some problems and some trouble to the government , " says student activist @entity56 of @entity57			1
" it will increase the ruling cost of the government so that they will have to react			0
" young people have been at the forefront of the democracy movement in @entity0 , where they face a growing shortage of university places , disappointing job prospects , and a widening wealth gap			1
but they -- and the pro-democracy legislators who have joined their protest -- insist the reason for their protest is both economic and political			0
" the livelihood issue of the people of @entity0 is very much affected by the political structure which completely swings over to the upper class and the elite , " says @entity81 , a pro-democracy lawmaker and former student activist who was detained during the @entity27 uprising			1
" for young people in @entity0 , if you want to climb that so - called ladder of mobility , you have to be politically ... correct and that is horrible			1
" since the handover from @entity95 in 1997 , @entity0 has been governed under @entity97 's principle of " one country , two systems " -- giving it rights and freedoms unseen in the mainland			2
but @entity0 's student protesters want more			2
they want the right to vote on candidates for chief executive who are independent of @entity25			0
" it 's not like the @entity97 government owes us anything , " says @entity56			0
" we have the right to have these things			0
we have the right to have democracy -- true democracy -- and universal suffrage because this is a human right			0
" creating ' a miracle ' idealistic words			0
and her teenage ally is not shy to admit the challenges ahead			0
" fighting for true universal suffrage in @entity0 is trying turn something impossible to possible , " concedes @entity38			2
" under the democracy movement , every activist is trying to create a miracle			0
" in the early days of the @entity29 , @entity56 posted an earnest online appeal to " please help @entity0			1
" the clip quickly went viral , reaching more than a million views			0
after making the cover of @entity132 's international edition , @entity38 was included in the magazine 's annual list of most influential teenagers			0
their struggle for democracy was also mentioned this week in an @entity140 acceptance speech , as musician @entity141 linked the @entity143 civil rights movement to occupy @entity0			1
such global attention is coveted by the territory 's pro-democracy activists			2
" what we need is international public opinion to keep a watch on @entity97 , so that they should leave @entity0 alone , " says @entity81			2
" we in @entity0 , we have nothing			2
we do n't have arms , we do n't have anything to protect ourselves			0
we have just the people			0
" and people in @entity0 are nothing like sheep , especially its young activists			1
they are dauntless and determined to have a say in @entity0 's political destiny .			2

in his @entity5 message @entity0 leader @entity7 urged *residents* to be more accommodating , like sheep
but activists behind the pro-democracy @entity29 have vowed to return to the streets
they tell @entity1 they see civil disobedience tactics as the only way to put pressure on the government
