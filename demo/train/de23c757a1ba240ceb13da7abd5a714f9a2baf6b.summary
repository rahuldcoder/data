@entity1 , @entity0 -- thousands of protesters spilled into the streets of @entity0 on tuesday , an unprecedented display of anti-government rage inspired in part by the tumult in the nearby @entity10 nation of @entity11			1

two demonstrators died in the eastern city of @entity21 , and one policeman was killed in @entity1 , it said			0

demonstrators threw rocks at police , and police hurled rocks back			0
tear - gas canisters were shot at demonstrators , and the protesters threw them back			2
protest organizers said they hope to capture the regional momentum for political change set by @entity11 , who 10 days ago forced the collapse of @entity48 @entity47 's 23 - year rule			1
the grievances were foreshadowed by several @entity0 who set themselves or tried to set themselves on fire this month , mirroring the self - immolation of a @entity11 man whose action spurred the uprising there			1
the @entity11 uprising was the most successful revolt in the region since 1979 , but it is anybody 's guess whether uprisings will spread to other @entity63 - speaking lands			1
@entity64 , a @entity65 historian at the @entity66 , says @entity11 is different from other @entity68 nations			1
@entity11 , he said , is the " most secular country in the @entity68 world			1
" its traditions have favored women 's rights , and its @entity73 influence is negligible			1
the @entity74 and other governments are monitoring the demonstrations in @entity1 and elsewhere closely			0
@entity74 secretary of state @entity77 urged all people to " exercise restraint " and supported " the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people			2
" " but our assessment is that the @entity0 government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the @entity0 people , " she said			1
to highlight the role of police corruption , the protest organizers in @entity0 picked january 25 -- @entity94 and a national holiday -- to hold protests			1
the protests started off small , but they grew as people came to the center of the city from bridges over the @entity102			2
police were restrained and at times were seemingly outnumbered by the protesters , who sang the national anthem and inched forward to express their ire toward the government			2
witnesses said large groups of plainclothes police were heading to @entity29			2
protesters had been expressing their anger over the rising cost of living , failed economic policies and corruption , but all those concerns were distilled into one overriding demand : the resignation of president @entity120 , in power for three decades			2
the outpouring included young and old , @entity123 and @entity124 , students , workers and businesspeople			0
" we breathe corruption in the air , " said one demonstrator , who along with others said their children have no future			0
at its peak there were perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 people in @entity29 , but that crowd later dwindled to about 5,000 to 8,000			0
the main road in front of parliament , @entity142 , was closed to traffic			0
the square is two blocks from parliament			0
" @entity0 have the right to express themselves , " @entity147 spokesman @entity146 said of the protests			1
the @entity24 called on demonstrators to follow the law and avoid threatening the safety of bystanders , the public and private property			0
social media have been all - important in mobilizing and organizing protests			0
but bloggers and others in @entity0 reported problems with electronic communication later in the day			2
activists ca n't access their cell phones or text messages , and opposition websites ca n't be accessed			0
@entity167 was blocked in @entity0 about 11 a.m. et , the company said			2
there were other demonstrations in @entity1 suburbs of @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
one man said @entity0 is not @entity11 , it 's @entity176 under @entity177 , a reference to the late and much - reviled communist leader			1
the front to defend @entity181 , an alliance of lawyers who helped organize the events , said that about 200 demonstrators were in the southern city of @entity187 , 2,000 in the eastern city of @entity189 and about 3,000 in the northern city of @entity191			0
the @entity0 government did not issue permits for tuesday 's planned protests			1
in an interview released tuesday with state - run @entity198 newspaper , interior minister @entity195 warned that " the security agencies are able to stop any attempt to attend " the demonstrations and called the efforts of the " youth staging street protests ineffective			2
" by early tuesday morning , more than 90,000 people throughout the country had pledged to participate in the @entity207 event " we are all @entity212 , " named after an @entity209 activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police			0
the @entity207 group demands raising the minimum wage , firing the interior minister , creating two - term presidential term limits and scrapping existing emergency laws that the group says " resulted in police control " over the people and the nation			0
@entity222 released a statement monday " urging the @entity0 authorities not to crack down " on the planned nationwide demonstration			1
the banned @entity226 , the biggest organized opposition to @entity120 's regime , had stated it would not have an official presence at tuesday 's protests , but some of its members " have reportedly been summoned and threatened with arrest and detention " if they attend and protest , @entity222 said			1
opposition leader and @entity238 laureate @entity237 posted statements supporting the protests on his @entity167 account			0
he also created a video statement addressing policemen that was released monday on @entity244			0
" i sympathize with you because sometimes you are asked to do things that you do not want to do , " @entity237 said			0
" one day , i hope that you will regain your role as the protectors of the people ; rather than protectors of ... fraud elections			2
i am sure that every one of you deep inside is looking forward to the day that his role will again be with the people and a part of them , rather than against them , " he said			0
public sentiment against state security forces has grown recently with alleged videos of police brutality shown on the internet			1
a recent report from @entity264 said the problem is " epidemic , " and " in most cases , officials torture detainees to obtain information and coerce confessions , occasionally leading to death in custody			0
" some other human rights groups , such as the @entity275 , have drawn a comparison between @entity0 and @entity11 under @entity47 , in terms of the level of government corruption and police brutality			1
@entity195 , the @entity0 interior minister , dismissed any such comparisons , calling it " propaganda " that had been rejected by politicians as " intellectual immaturity			2
" but one woman , identified only as @entity288 , who planned to attend the tuesday protests , disagreed			0
she wrote in an online post , " i hope the ( @entity11 - style ) revolution will be taught in history			1
and that @entity0 will learn in school later about the january 25th revolution			1
