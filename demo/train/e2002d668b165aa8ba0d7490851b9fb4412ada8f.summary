-- one of the most debilitating medical conditions in @entity2 is n't fatal			1
in fact , it 's easily curable			2
the culprit is small , but its impact is big			2
the chigoe flea , more commonly known as a jigger , typically burrows itself into the feet and hands			2
it prevents millions of children from attending school , stops farmers from working their land , and makes walking all but unbearable			1
@entity17 businessman @entity16 had jiggers as a kid , and he remembers how he was stigmatized by his classmates , for in his school , the parasite singled you out as poor			1
" i almost dropped out of primary school because of the effects , because i could not stand the way my classmates laughed at me and used to harass me			1
they would step on me , and i did n't have shoes , " he recalls			2
luckily , @entity16 's family owned cattle , and had a cattle dip -- a bath filled with insecticide -- which they used to treat the cows			1
@entity16 cured himself by dipping his hands and feet in the water			1
he was able to continue his studies , and went on to attend university in @entity41			2
after successfully launching a number of businesses , @entity16 returned to his home village in @entity45 , where he decided to give back to his community			1
at first , he simply donated food and clothes , but soon he realized the adverse effect jiggers was having on his fellow villagers			2
" i was shocked when i visited some of the homes and saw that some kids had never gone to school , that men and women were n't going to their farms			2
they were disabled because of the jigger menace			0
" @entity16 set up the @entity59 , which treats victims of jiggers throughout @entity17			1
originally , the trust signed up four families			0
today , 2.6 million @entity17 are registered with the group			1
the banana solution @entity16 saw how jiggers entrenches families deeper into poverty			1
as a solution , he set up a banana farm on a stretch of land donated by his aunt			0
jigger survivors can join the farm , and are given free materials , from seeds to fertilizer , to enrich their land back home			0
" every member has to duplicate what we are doing on their own particular farm , " he says			0
" we provide them with seedlings to plant in the communal farm , and give them seedlings to plant in their own individual farm ... it 's like a learning center where every member of the community can learn more on how to do bananas			0
" @entity16 has expanded the entrepreneurial side of his trust to include chicken and rabbit farming , as well as bee keeping			1
the rural ambulance in his attempt to eradicate jiggers from his home country , @entity16 realized how difficult it can be for many living in rural communities to seek medical attention			1
he heard stories of people brought to hospitals in sacks and wheelbarrows			0
he even heard about a boy who broke his back in a motorcycle accident while he was being transported to a medical facility for a fractured arm			0
" the fact is , most people who live at the bottom of poverty do n't have mobile phones , they do n't have radios or tv sets , they have no channel of communication			0
they might not even know what kind of a dispensary or hospital is near them , " he notes			0
it was then that he developed the ambulance @entity133 -- or village ambulance			0
it 's basically a detachable bed -- complete with a medical and maternity kit -- that hooks onto a motorbike			0
" you can have a hospital , but are people able to visit ? are they able to walk ? are they able to call ? are they able to even have information on those types of facilities ? let 's not have a very beautiful hospital where people are not able to get access			0
