-- @entity1 had killed before			1
the first time , presumably , was in 1980			2
then about 40 years old , @entity1 struck his grandmother with a hammer			1
a year later , he was convicted of first - degree manslaughter in her death			0
flash forward to before dawn monday , in @entity8 , @entity9 , a town of about 43,000 people located 10 miles east of @entity13			2
that 's when and where , police chief @entity15 said , @entity1 presumably set his and his sister 's home ablaze , lugged weapons up a hill , then waited			1
when local firefighters arrived at the scene , @entity1 fired and killed again			1
' chaos ' : gunman ambushes , kills 2 firefighters authorities have n't given a motive for the latest violence , which left two firefighters dead and two other firefighters and an off - duty police officer from a nearby town wounded			1
and they ca n't ask the shooter , who was found dead of a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the head around 11 a.m. , about six hours after first calls about the fire came in			1
but the @entity8 police chief has his own idea about why this happened			0
" just looking at the history , obviously this is an individual who had a lot of problems , to kill his grandmother , " @entity15 said			2
" and i 'm sure there were ... mental health issues involved			0
" after his 1981 manslaughter conviction , @entity1 was given an indeterminate sentence , said @entity53 district attorney @entity52			2
he ended up spending nearly 18 years behind bars until his release in 1998			1
through 2006 , @entity1 was on supervised parole , during which time @entity52 said she was n't aware of any events suggesting he had gotten into further trouble			1
nor , @entity15 said , had police had any " contact with him criminally " in the recent past			0
by then , @entity1 was living in a home in @entity8 , likely with his sister , who was still unaccounted for monday afternoon			1
their mother had died sometime in the past year , according to @entity15			0
he 'd accumulated weapons , bringing " several different types " with him before the shootings , the police chief said			0
it is not known how he obtained these firearms , but ex-felons are not allowed to possess weapons			0
but because @entity1 had them , two families are in mourning			2
many of his former neighbors are homeless , because having a gunman on the loose slowed fire crews ' efforts to corral a blaze that eventually destroyed seven homes			0
this is a day where people are getting together to celebrate a holiday , " lt. gov. @entity85 told reporters in @entity8			0
" this tragedy is just unthinkable and unspeakable			0
