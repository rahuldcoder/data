-- a man opens fire in a national park , killing a ranger who was attempting to stop him after he blew through a vehicle checkpoint			1
a second man is suspected in the stabbing deaths of four homeless men in @entity9			1
both men , @entity12 military veterans , served in @entity13 -- and both , according to authorities and those who knew them , returned home changed men after their combat service			1
@entity19 vet could face death penalty a coincidence -- two recent high - profile cases ? or a sign of an increase in hostile behavior as @entity12 troops complete their withdrawal from @entity13 , similar to that seen when @entity12 troops returned home from the @entity31 ? " you 're going to see this more and more over the next 10 years , " said @entity32 , founder of the @entity33 , who has been working with veterans since 1970			1
" ... there 's a percentage that come back , depending on how much trauma and how much killing they 're involved in , they 're going to act out			1
" @entity42 , a ranger at @entity44 's @entity43 , was shot to death on @entity46			1
police believe @entity43 , who served in @entity13 from 2007 to 2009 , was responsible for the shooting			1
after a manhunt , authorities found @entity53 ' body face down in a creek in the park			2
according to court documents obtained by @entity0 affiliate @entity59 , the woman with whom @entity53 was in a custody dispute said she believed he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his deployment			2
@entity53 was emotionally unstable , vindictive and anger - prone , the woman said , and owned many knives and guns			2
the woman said she was frightened to be in the same state with him , the documents said			2
in @entity9 , former @entity70 cpl. @entity69 is accused of stabbing four homeless men to death			1
according to the military , @entity69 was deployed to @entity13 during 2008			2
a friend of his , who asked to be identified only as @entity75 , told @entity0 monday that " something happened " after @entity69 returned from @entity13			2
" he was a little bit more serious			2
it seemed like there was something on his mind , " @entity75 said			2
" he seemed really depressed and down , and things in his life were n't looking that well			2
" his father , @entity86 , told the @entity87 that upon his return , his son began talking about things that " did n't make any sense , " like the @entity91			2
it 's important to note , experts said , that the two cases represent the extreme end of a spectrum of behavior signifying difficulties faced by returning troops , and some experience little difficulty , if any			1
" what we do n't want to do is stigmatize veterans by saying they 're walking time bombs , " said @entity102 , chief clinical officer for the @entity105 , @entity106 and a former @entity104 colonel			1
" but study after study has highlighted the struggles faced by troops returning home , including substance abuse , relationship problems , aggression or depression , she and others noted			1
some may have trouble sitting still in college classes , @entity122 said			0
others may react with aggression at a perceived threat , such as being pulled over for a traffic violation , @entity32 said			0
still others have trouble riding in or driving vehicles because they are used to the threat of @entity131 ( improvised explosive devices ) , or may react aggressively to a sudden move , even one by their spouse , he said			0
" it 's embedded in ( the service member ) to do that , " @entity32 said			0
" it looks brutal , it is brutal , it 's horrible , it 's heinous , but they switch on like that because they have n't been switched off			0
" suicide is also a growing problem			0
the @entity104 reported a record - high number of suicides in july 2011 , with the deaths of 33 active - and reserve - component service members categorized as suicides			0
while homicides by former troops are n't tracked , many of the dynamics leading to suicidal behavior are similar to those seen in murder - suicides or homicides , @entity122 said			1
the @entity12 @entity162 and others have made strides in addressing @entity165 in veterans , the experts said			1
other groups and resources , such as the @entity169 , are also available			0
but many veterans have trouble seeking help , said @entity173 , an associate professor of psychiatry at @entity175 who works with returning service members			1
" @entity177 , " he said			0
every veteran he works with in his clinic is married , he said			0
" it 's because their wives are the ones who helped bring them in			0
" " i 'm not seeing everybody out there , " he said			0
" i 'm not seeing a random sampling of all the returning vets			1
i 'm seeing the ones who make it in , and they make it in largely through the auspices of a loved one who helps get them over that hump			1
... the heroes in my clinic are the wives who 've learned to adjust and adapt			0
" absent that support , some vets may not take that step , he said			1
one of @entity165 's fundamental features , @entity173 noted , is a lack of trust : in one 's self , in others , in humans , " that the world will give them a fair shake			0
... there is this tremendous hurdle for them to overcome to get treatment			0
" @entity173 and @entity32 noted that people who are trained killers can have trouble switching out of that role after returning home			1
they come home " full of war energy ... and it 's hard for them to have a relationship with anybody other than somebody in your unit , " @entity32 said			1
" your unit is removed			0
you 're now around a touchy - feely wife or girlfriend that you do n't understand			0
" combat veterans who may have killed or witnessed the deaths of women and children are plagued by guilt , which affects relationships with their own families , he said			1
@entity32 said a significant effort to deprogram soldiers should be made before they leave the military			0
while the @entity70 do have a program , he said , many troops do n't listen ; those who do have said it 's " oversimplified			0
" issues such as employment , education and housing must also be examined as part of an overall effort to support veterans , @entity122 said			1
" the @entity162 and the military can only do so much , " @entity122 said			0
" it really takes a nationwide effort and a local community effort ... this is an issue that 's not going to go away			0
it 's going to be with us for 10 , 20 , 30 years			0

veterans are accused of homicides in @entity105 and @entity9
violence by returning veterans may be on the rise , experts say
some may experience relationship difficulties or struggle with substance abuse
loved ones can be key in *encouraging* vets to seek help
