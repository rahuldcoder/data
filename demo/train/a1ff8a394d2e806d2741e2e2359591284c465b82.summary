" i was hiding behind a water tank in the front yard and saw them killing my father and brother and [ taking ] away my mother and sister			0
i do n't know anything about them since , " says @entity8 , a 14 - year - old @entity9 girl			1
" they put us in trucks and drove us to a big building , before transferring us to a hall across the road , " explains @entity12 , 19 and also @entity9			2
" then their seniors came and started condemning our religion and asking us to convert to @entity22 ... they separated me along with other young ones and ordered us to stay there while taking away the elderly women			1
" the man i was given to raped me several times and then left me in the room on my own			0
i was shaking from pain and fear in that hot room , my entire body sweating			0
suddenly , another man came and did what he wanted to do despite me crying and begging him , kissing his foot to leave me alone ... " @entity38 and @entity12 ( not their real names ) now live with their relatives in newly - established displaced persons camps in @entity42 's @entity41			2
they are among thousands of @entity9 women abducted by jihadists during their attack on the @entity48 district on 2 august 2014			1
since then , one hundred girls and women have managed to escape their jailers and rejoin their community			2
according to our field work , which has involved interviews with witnesses and survivors , and based on other reports which have reached us , more than 2,500 @entity9 girls and women were abducted during the attack			1
women sold ' like cattle ' the extent of the @entity66 brutality toward those women is unknown			0
we do know from witness statements and testimonies by survivors that they have been systematically separated by age and physical appearance , forced to convert to @entity22 , and subjected to different forms of physical and sexual violence , including rape and sex slavery			1
the jihadists themselves have confirmed these acts through their media outlets , such as the @entity82 website @entity83 , saying the acts were established aspects of @entity86 , because they view @entity9 as heretics who should face conversion or die			1
according to the spokesman for the @entity42 @entity94 , @entity95 , the abducted @entity9 women " were taken as spoils of war and exposed at a market for sale "			1
the enslaved women have been treated like cattle -- complete with price tags -- and trafficked in markets in @entity101 in @entity42 , and @entity102 in @entity103			1
their " prices " have varied between $ 25 and $ 1,000			0
they were " cheaply sold " and mainly given to youngsters as a way to encourage them to join @entity66			0
those women who resisted were killed , and some committed suicide			0
these forms of violence are used as war strategies by the jihadists to subjugate the entire community , to inculcate fear , to undermine community and family structures , and to pollute the bloodline of the population			1
severe psychological trauma local authorities , in coordination with community leaders and activists , have been working on strategies to rescue and care for the enslaved women			2
these include negotiation with @entity131 tribal leaders in the areas under @entity66 control to help free the women and ensure their safe return to their families , raising awareness , and preventive and protective measures to help survivors reintegrate into their family and community structures			2
the rescue strategies consist of large efforts to liberate the abducted women ; so far , around 100 have reached @entity48 , where they now live in overflowing cities and towns , mainly in @entity41 and @entity149 governorates			2
officials and humanitarian organizations have been busy providing aid and care facilities via a health team of doctors and social workers , but they face a challenge : the level of need is much higher than that local authorities are equipped to deal with			0
in addition to physical wounds , the women have suffered severe psychological trauma			2
the situation is distressing and requires an urgent need for explicit psychological as well as gynecological treatment			0
the international community should take the case seriously and address intervention strategies with urgent implementation measures			1
since the @entity66 attack , the @entity9 community has been subjected to horrendous crimes , including murder , the destruction of their homes , arrest and kidnapping , enforced disappearance as well as displacement , torture and sexual slavery , and desecration of their holy shrines			1
as @entity189 and @entity9 , they are condemned as heretics and devil worshippers			0
acts of genocide these acts are categorized as crimes against humanity by the @entity197 , but they are also acts of genocide : they consist of a systematic , intentional and well planned operation to eliminate an entire group because of its ethnic and religious identity			0
the international community should mobilize resources and establish a fact - finding commission of experts to investigate and collect evidence from eye - witnesses , highlighting sexual violence against women			1
such timely data and documentation should facilitate not only the prosecution of those responsible , but also the international recognition of these acts as genocide			0
the process should also include support mechanisms for healing , reparation , compensation , preserving memories and the reintegration of these women into normal life , including much needed post-trauma support for victims and families after their release			0
the @entity231 is overwhelmed by the plight of refugees and @entity234 , with more than 1.5 million people living in camps and others still sheltering in community halls or being hosted by the local population or their relatives			0
the @entity243 authorities are willing to cooperate with international agencies with the aim of providing all necessary aid to these populations , facilitating the prosecution of those responsible and the international recognition of the acts carried out against @entity9 as genocide			1
