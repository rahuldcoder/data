as millions of @entity1 gather in their homes for the holidays , there will be those who will congregate in a different kind of home			1
an abode common to other parts of the world now proliferates across @entity1 : tent cities			1
the total number of homeless people residing in tents and makeshift homes is unknown			1
many of these communities are small and hidden from public view , while others claim hundreds of residents and are sprinkled through major urban areas			1
some , like those tucked under roadways , are temporary and relocate frequently			0
their conditions are vile , unsanitary and fail to provide refuge from storms and winds			0
then there are communities , such as @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , that have a more sustained presence			1
the 13 - year - old " ecovillage " set up by homeless people is hygienic and self - sufficient			1
preliminary findings by @entity36 show that tent cities have been documented in almost every state , and they 're growing			1
a report released by the @entity41 , for example , found that homelessness and hunger rates are rising , culminating in 47 million @entity1 living below the poverty line			1
a fledgling economic recovery , high unemployment and contracting government services are largely to blame			0
so is the paucity -- or paradox -- of affordable housing			0
while homelessness is increasing , more than 10 % of homes in @entity1 are empty			1
emergency services , meanwhile , are n't filling the void			0
homeless families and single adults are routinely turned away by shelter homes because of lack of bed space			2
tent cities are an organic , last resort response to crushing economic circumstances			1
yet , rather than ameliorating the conditions that give rise to these communities , many states and municipalities are cracking down			1
while some encampments are legally sanctioned or permitted to operate on church grounds , officials routinely invoke prohibitions against public camping and sleeping to disband these encampments , leaving tenants languishing out in the cold			0
epithets suggesting that homeless people are mentally ill , lazy , criminal , violent or some combination thereof only fuels the fire			2
these accusations are largely urban myth			0
most homeless people do not suffer from mental illness or drug abuse			2
many homeless people have jobs but simply ca n't afford housing			2
some tent cities , for example , cater to local economies , and many of their residents are gainfully employed			1
homeless people also tend to be the victims of countless hate crimes , even though they are a protected class under numerous state hate crime statutes			2
lost in this shameful rhetoric is the fact that the right to housing is a bedrock of international law and protected by @entity1 law			1
some courts have held that tearing down camps when no alternative is available amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and a deprivation of property without due process of law			0
that we can even stroll through our cities while some of the residents languish in squalor is hard to believe			2
a few decades ago , tent cities would have been unimaginable			1
in 1964 , a group of researchers famously roamed the parks of @entity122 and found only one homeless man			2
fifty years later , homelessness in @entity122 has reached a record high			0
the same can be said for much of @entity1 : @entity126 has doubled since the 1980s			1
those who declare that we 're close to ending poverty just need to look around and see the victims of the @entity131			0
tent cities are an ugly reminder of @entity1 's growing income inequalities			1
yet , in the absence of meaningful economic reform , these self - reliant communities must not be dismantled			2
nor should they be forgotten			0
for in sanctioning them , we risk capitulating to the epidemic of poverty and shifting our public policy from eliminating poverty to accommodating it			0
this is already happening in other parts of the world			0
in @entity152 , @entity151 , for example , slums freckle the landscape like skyscrapers			0
but sprouting from the dilapidation are antennas and electrical wires			0
some of the housing units have electricity , cable programming and mail delivery			0
and so the discussion no longer concerns extricating human beings from the slums but making the slums more habitable			0
we must not succumb to @entity1 's great divide			1
doing so is n't just a repudiation of the downtrodden ; it 's a stain on our national consciousness .			0

@entity174 : as @entity1 go home for the holidays , some homeless go to tent cities
@entity174 : tent cities , either makeshift or more permanent , proliferate across @entity1
he says instead of helping the homeless , states are cracking down on these communities
@entity174 : tent cities are a reminder of @entity1 's growing income inequalities
