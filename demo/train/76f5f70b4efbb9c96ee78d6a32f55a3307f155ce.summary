@entity0 -- @entity3 leaders will propose cutting more spending to balance the amount of additional disaster relief money in a short - term government spending measure defeated earlier by the @entity9 , two @entity3 sources told @entity1 on thursday			1
the additional spending cut , called an offset , would be roughly $ 100 million from a @entity12 loan program linked to the solar panel firm @entity14 , which recently collapsed , said the sources -- a @entity3 aide and a @entity3 member of @entity18 -- who spoke on condition of not being identified			1
the plan , which faces sharp @entity22 opposition , could pave the way for a partial government shutdown when the current fiscal year ends on september 30 if it is not resolved			1
debate on the measure began late thursday night , with a vote set for that night or early on friday morning			0
the @entity22 - controlled @entity29 wo n't take action until at least friday , having already adjourned for the day			1
senate majority leader @entity31 blasted it as " not an honest effort at compromise , " criticizing its @entity35 supporters of moving " even further towards the @entity36 ( and insisting ) on holding out on @entity37 who have suffered devastating losses			1
" " it fails to provide the relief that our fellow @entity37 need as they struggle to rebuild their lives in the wake of floods , wildfires and hurricanes , and it will be rejected by the @entity29 , " said the @entity40 @entity39 , warning the @entity42 could " run out of money as soon as monday			1
" the move was intended to persuade the 48 republicans who voted against the @entity3 measure wednesday night to change their minds , according to the @entity3 aide			1
language in a proposed amendment to the @entity29 bill , for instance , would rescind " the unobligated balances remaining " for the energy loan program			1
democrats in the @entity9 and @entity29 said thursday they oppose any offsets to counter the emergency spending for natural disasters , and the @entity3 strategy sets up a another budget showdown in @entity18 -- this time over the short - term spending measure that would fund the government for the first seven weeks of the new fiscal year , which begins october 1			1
on thursday night , senior @entity29 @entity22 leadership aide said the party 's caucus is united against @entity3 - tailored versions of the measure			1
" we are looking for a real attempt to compromise , not just an attempt to appease their own people , " the aide said			2
house speaker @entity81 , @entity82 , earlier insisted to reporters that an agreement would be reached and the spending measure passed to prevent a possible partial government shutdown			0
" there is no threat of a government shutdown			0
let 's just get this out there , " @entity81 said			0
in addition to the disagreement over offsets , the @entity22 - controlled @entity29 differs with the @entity9 on how much emergency money the measure would provide for disaster relief in the wake of @entity100 , @entity101 , wildfires and tornadoes this year			1
failure by @entity18 to pass the measure would mean a partial government shutdown at midnight next friday			0
however , the political fallout of such an impasse with a public already angered by congressional stalemate as an election year approaches makes a shutdown unlikely			0
" what we 've been trying to avoid are these constant scrums we have over government functioning the way it should , " @entity31 , @entity116 , told reporters earlier thursday			1
speaking before news of the additional offset provision added by @entity122 , @entity31 proclaimed himself " cautiously optimistic " an agreement would be reached			1
with @entity18 scheduled to begin a week - long recess on friday that would run through the end of the fiscal year , leaders began considering the possible necessity of delaying the break to complete work on the short - term spending measure			2
@entity31 said the @entity29 is " ready to stay in @entity0 next week			1
" and in a message to @entity9 members , @entity133 's office said " members are advised that a weekend session is now possible			0
" asked about the possibility of a weekend session , @entity81 said thursday : " i surely hope not			0
" the @entity9 vote wednesday was 195 " yea " and 230 " nay , " with 48 republicans joining all but a handful of minority @entity143 in opposing the short - term spending plan			1
most of republicans who voted " no " were conservatives who believed the overall spending level in the measure is too high			0
the failed vote was a second rebuke of @entity81 and the @entity9 @entity3 leadership by members elected to @entity18 last year with the support of the conservative tea party movement to give the @entity3 majority control			1
during the debt ceiling debate in july , @entity81 had to withdraw his own plan for deficit reduction at one point when it became clear he lacked sufficient support within his caucus to get it passed			0
this time , the speaker threatened members with pulling them from committee assignments if they failed to support the continuing resolution on wednesday , according to a @entity3 source who attended the @entity3 conference meeting			2
the source , speaking on condition of not being identified , said @entity81 " cracked the whip " at the wednesday morning meeting and told @entity122 bluntly they needed to back the measure or he 'd go to the steering committee and start pulling committee assignments for members who did n't vote for it			0
the @entity3 steering committee approves member committee assignments			2
on thursday , @entity81 shrugged off the defeat as the price of trying to get legislation through the democratic process			0
" i have no fear in allowing the @entity9 to work its will , " he said , adding : " does it make my life a little more difficult ? yes it does			0
" rep. @entity190 of @entity191 , a conservative freshman @entity3 who opposed the resolution , said removing the offset provision -- as @entity143 want -- would be " more problematic for me and probably for more of the caucus			1
" asked if he was concerned about @entity81 's threat to take away committee posts , @entity190 said : " it 's far less of a concern than going back home and not being able to explain my vote			0
" the @entity3 - based amendments relate to a federal loan program meant to promote alternate energy and also boost the economy			1
it is the same program that funded @entity14 , which declared bankruptcy late last month despite receiving a $ 535 million federal guarantee in 2009			2
the energy department is facing a september 30 deadline to give 14 companies final approval for loan guarantees totaling more than $ 9 billion			2
the continuing resolution , which would fund government agencies through november 18 , would allocate fewer resources to the @entity42 and the @entity216 for disaster response than approved by the @entity29 last week			1
additional funds are needed because the string of disasters this year has depleted the @entity42 and @entity216 coffers supporting recovery and rebuilding efforts			0
the @entity9 measure included a total of $ 3.6 billion in disaster relief money -- $ 1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $ 2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year that begins october 1			2
in addition , @entity9 @entity3 leaders insist that the $ 1 billion in immediate disaster funding be offset with $ 1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel - efficient cars			1
earlier this month , president @entity239 asked @entity18 for a total of $ 5.1 billion in additional disaster aid , $ 500 million of which was for immediate relief			0
last week , the @entity29 passed a measure with bipartisan support that would provide $ 6.9 billion for @entity42 and other federal agencies , to be used both for immediate disaster relief as well as in the new fiscal year			1
the @entity29 version required no spending offsets			2
rep. @entity251 of @entity252 , the no. 2 @entity253 , said his party would support the @entity9 measure if the offset provision were removed , as did rep. @entity257 of @entity0 , the ranking @entity39 on the @entity258			1
on the @entity29 side , @entity31 indicated possible acceptance of the @entity9 proposal minus the offset , known as " pay - for " in legislative parlance			1
asked if the amount of disaster funding in the @entity9 version is sufficient , @entity31 said : " the answer is no , it 's not sufficient , but if they get rid of pay - for , we 'll take a look at that			1
" during floor debate on the measure , @entity251 and other @entity143 complained that any kind of offset would be unprecedented for emergency funding to help @entity37 in need			1
" even if they had the best offset in the world , i still think it 's wrong " to require equivalent spending cuts when getting money to disaster victims , said @entity9 minority leader @entity275 , @entity276			2
conservative @entity35 argued that the nation 's expanding deficits require as much spending restraint as possible			0
" we 're trying to effect change in a way that we spend taxpayer dollars			0
that 's what this whole thing is about , " @entity133 , @entity289 , said wednesday night			0
" no one is denying anyone disaster aid if they need it , and we 're trying to be responsible and to do the right thing			0
" however , the inability of @entity133 and the rest of the @entity3 leadership to push through the resolution showed the unstable politics at play			2
democrats were nearly united in opposing the plan , meaning the @entity35 could n't afford the 48 defections from their ranks			0
for @entity81 , voting against the @entity3 resolution amounted , in essence , to " voting to spend more money " in the end , he said thursday			2
to @entity251 , the defeat of the @entity3 measure in the @entity9 " says that we are continuing to struggle to do things in a bipartisan fashion			2
" if @entity35 " expect our votes , they have to work with us , " he said			0
" they ca n't just give us something and say ... their way or the highway			0
" " they 've shown that they ca n't govern , " rep. @entity323 , @entity116 - @entity324 , said of the @entity122			0
" we could work this out with them in the spirit of bipartisanship , but they can not work it out with themselves			0
" @entity1 's @entity330 and @entity331 contributed to this report .			0

new : majority leader @entity31 says the @entity3 - backed bill " will be rejected by the @entity29 "
new : the @entity29 is " ready to stay in @entity0 next week , " he adds
a @entity22 aide says @entity143 are united against an offset to the bill
the added offset would cut a federal loan fund linked to a bankrupt solar energy firm
