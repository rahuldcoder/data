@entity0 led the procession solemnly , silently			1
yet there was noise all around him -- and all for him			0
one day earlier , @entity0 -- the sergeant - at - arms of @entity6 's @entity5 -- was credited with gunning down an armed man who 'd stormed in minutes after killing a @entity6 soldier standing guard at a nearby veterans memorial			1
parliamentarians responded thursday by saluting @entity0 with a spirited standing ovation as he walked , in front of the line , as part of his ceremonial duties to usher the start of a new session			2
their fervent applause was interrupted only by occasional cheers and pounding of benches			0
yet @entity0 , carrying a ceremonial sword and dressed in traditional attire , nodded gently to acknowledge the ovation but did n't address the crowd			2
the only time he spoke , and the only hint of a smile , came when prime minister @entity30 walked back to the sergeant - at - arms seat in the back of the hall -- at which point the two shook hands and @entity0 whispered a few words in @entity30 's ear			1
the sergeant - at - arms did offer remarks -- his first since the shootings -- later in a written statement			1
he said he was " very touched " by the attention over his role in ending the attack , while adding that he has " the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of members , employees and visitors " to @entity49			0
" yesterday , during extraordinary circumstances , security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage			0
i am grateful and proud to be part of this team , " he said			0
@entity60 commissioner @entity59 said thursday that @entity61 traded gunshots with an officer before heading down a hall towards @entity49 , where @entity0 and others engaged him			1
" i understood that the suspect and mr. @entity0 were behind pillars and exchanging fire , " @entity59 said			2
" the suspect repositioned himself to get a better shot at mr. @entity0 ... we heard ( a ) multitude of shots , and that mr. @entity0 did shoot			2
" how do you characterize what the 58 - year - old @entity0 did that day ? members of @entity49 , the media and the public resoundingly settled on one word : hero			1
as parliamentarian @entity87 tweeted , " mps and @entity83 staff owe their safety , even lives , to @entity85 at @entity86			0
" had a ceremonial and law enforcement role @entity0 is n't a stranger to the spotlight , although he 's typically on the edge of it			1
when world leaders come through @entity94 , he is often right beside them at the @entity5			2
photo after photo from the past few years show him , a handful of @entity6 politicians and the international figures -- from @entity101 prime minister @entity100 to @entity103 chancellor @entity102 to @entity105 president @entity104 -- on hand			2
this is all part of the ceremonial duties of sergeant - at - arms , a position that 's been occupied by only 10 people since its inception in 1867			1
@entity0 , for instance , is sometimes charged with carrying a special sword in the commission of his duties			2
yet , for all the pomp and circumstance , @entity0 is above all a man of the law			2
that speaks to his bigger role at the @entity5 as its top law enforcement officer , charged with overseeing security on the grounds and safeguarding various officials			0
to put what he did wednesday in perspective , consider this : he was like a police chief or sheriff who takes out his weapon and ends a violent attack			0
on the one hand , @entity0 is n't new to law enforcement , having spent 28 years with the @entity60			0
yet despite all that time , his brother believes that wednesday was the first time @entity0 ever exchanged gunfire with anyone			1
" for it now to happen at @entity49 ... is unbelievable , " @entity140 told @entity141			0
" we 're just relieved he 's ok			0
" who was the gunman ? reporter who knows @entity0 calls him ' an utmost professional ' @entity140 describes his brother as " an exemplary individual who , throughout ... his career , put his country and his community first			1
" that includes all his years with @entity6 's national police force , including a high - profile stint in the province of @entity154 during a tense time there			1
" he was always cool under pressure ; he was always respectful and accommodating , " @entity156 , a former @entity157 journalist who is now the @entity159 's @entity158 news editor , told @entity141			0
@entity156 remembers @entity0 , from the time she met him in the 2000s , as " a stand - up guy ( who is ) well - trained			1
" asked about his exploits wednesday , @entity156 said , " it 's not surprising at all			0
because ( @entity0 ) is an utmost professional			0
" @entity0 left the @entity60 to become the @entity5 ' security director , the @entity157 reported			1
he became sergeant - at - arms in 2006 , where he has impressed many with his demeanor as much as his professionalism			1
tweeted @entity173 , a parliamentarian from @entity174 : " @entity85 at arms @entity0 - nicest guy you 'll ever meet			1
i am lucky to call him a friend			0
" today he is also our hero and we are 4evr grateful			0

police official : @entity0 exchanged gunshots from behind a pillar
brother : this was the first time @entity0 exchanged gunfire over a long career
he became sergeant - at - arms for @entity6 's @entity5 in 2006
one *legislator* calls him the " nicest guy you 'll ever meet " and " our hero "
