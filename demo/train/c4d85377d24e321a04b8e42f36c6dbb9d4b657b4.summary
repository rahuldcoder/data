the death of a 14 - year - old shot by police just blocks from his school is the latest flashpoint as political tensions mount in @entity8 and pockets of anti-government protests erupt throughout the country			1
@entity12 , a high school student , was killed tuesday when he got caught between protesters and national police in the western city of @entity16			1
a police officer fatally shot @entity12 , officials say			1
the government and the opposition alike have condemned the teen 's killing , but @entity8 's recent history of violence and sharp political polarization hang over this shooting			1
already protesters opposed to president @entity29 's government are pointing to the teen 's death as a fresh rallying cry			1
and @entity29 has blamed protesters for the violence that led to the shooting			2
a year ago , @entity16 was the birthplace of anti-government protests that spread nationwide			1
the standoffs between security forces and protesters lingered for weeks and became violent , with more than 40 deaths , according to the government			2
three witnesses at tuesday 's protest said that @entity12 was not a protester and had inadvertently come across the confrontation after leaving school			1
@entity46 , the slain teen 's mother , told @entity48 her son was walking four blocks from his school when a riot broke out around him			1
the protesters -- mostly students from a nearby university -- were running from police at the moment that @entity12 walked into the area , according to the witnesses , who spoke with @entity0 en @entity59			1
the teen tried to protect himself by ducking under a car but suffered a direct shot from an officer 's firearm , the witnesses said			2
@entity0 has not independently confirmed how the shooting unfolded			2
the governor of the state of @entity68 , where @entity16 is located , declined to comment on his government 's version of events			0
the teen 's death sparked several protests around the country wednesday			1
in @entity78 , demonstrators outside the justice ministry held up notebooks smeared with red paint to symbolize the blood of the country 's youth they say has been spilled			0
this is what we , the students , have -- ideas , " protester @entity85 said			0
" we say to mr. @entity29 , ' are you afraid of the students ? these are our weapons : a notebook , pens , thoughts and ideology			0
' " the @entity8 government responded quickly to the killing , detaining and identifying the national police officer who shot the teen			1
the interior ministry named @entity102 , 23 , as the shooter			0
attorney general @entity104 announced wednesday that @entity105 is formally charged with intentional homicide , and that nine protesters were also arrested in @entity16			0
interior minister @entity109 , speaking on state television , vowed that the officer would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law			0
she appealed for calm , asking students to remember the 43 deaths recorded in clashes last year			1
the police has been reformed since then , she said , calling the national police force a " protector of human rights			1
" " this is an isolated incident that does not represent the behavior of the new , humanist police , " @entity109 said			1
to protesters , and to the family of the slain teen , these comments seem to be insincere , or outright lies			0
@entity130 , the father of the slain teen , told @entity0 en @entity59 's @entity132 that he wants the full weight of the law to be applied to the officer but is not comforted by the government 's actions			0
the officer 's quick confession might be part of a strategy to get a lenient sentence , @entity130 said			0
he is afraid the justice system will go easy on @entity105 because he is a police officer			2
" this was a murder ; this was a homicide committed by this man , and he should pay with the full weight of the law , " he said			0
the father also questioned the government 's claims of what kind of projectile killed his son			2
the interior minister said @entity105 shot @entity12 with a shotgun loaded with rubber pellets			0
@entity130 said that if the weapon was indeed a shotgun , it was loaded with lead pellets , not rubber			0
the coroner 's report said that a firearm caused the fatal wound , without detailing whether it was rubber or lead pellets , the father said			0
the government also said that police provided first aid to the injured teen , something that witnesses deny			2
@entity130 pleaded for police to " be guardians " while on duty , saying he hopes another child wo n't become a victim			2
the fury over tuesday 's shooting echoes the arguments made by pro- and anti-government groups in the past			1
@entity29 framed the boy 's death around the actions of the protesters in @entity16			2
he described a group of " hooded youths " who were " being violent , " beating police and pelting officers with rocks before police responded with force			2
critics of the government turned to one of their most powerful tools -- social media -- to accuse the security forces of abuses and to share photos they say back their allegations			0
tweets were tagged with # @entity205 , # @entity206 and # @entity207 , literally accusing the president of killing students			0
government supporters tweeted under the banner # @entity211 , or " complete support for @entity29			0
" all this turmoil comes during an economic crisis in oil - rich @entity8			1
@entity8 have endured years of shortages of basic goods , products and services			1
consumers have to stand in line for hours for staples such as milk , chicken and cornmeal			0
even toilet paper and condoms are scarce			0
@entity8 's currency , the bolivar , is overvalued			1
the official exchange rate is 6.3 per dollar , but dollars are being exchanged in the black market at 190 - to - 1 creating all kinds of problems for foreign companies , including @entity237 ones			2
