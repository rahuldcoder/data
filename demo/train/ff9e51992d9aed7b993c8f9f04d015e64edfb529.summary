-- @entity2 president @entity1 is meeting this week with president @entity3 in @entity4 amid increasing ambivalence in the @entity6 about what to do about the war in @entity2			1
@entity6 are tired of the war			0
too much blood and treasure has been spent			0
the @entity11 is grappling with troop numbers for 2013 and with the nature and scope of any @entity6 mission after 2014			2
with the persisting corruption and poor governance of the @entity2 government and @entity1 's fear that the @entity6 is preparing to abandon him , the relationship between @entity17 and @entity4 has steadily deteriorated			1
as the @entity6 radically reduces its mission in @entity2 , it will leave behind a stalled and perilous security situation and a likely severe economic downturn			1
many @entity2 expect a collapse into civil war , and few see their political system as legitimate			0
@entity1 and @entity3 face thorny issues such as the stalled negotiations with the @entity31			1
recently , @entity17 has persuaded @entity32 to release some @entity31 prisoners to jump - start the negotiations , relegating the @entity6 to the back seat			2
much to the displeasure of the @entity38 , the @entity2 government also plans to release several hundred @entity31 - linked prisoners , although any real momentum in the negotiations is yet to take place			2
@entity6 may remove all triips from @entity2 after 2014 @entity4 needs to be careful that negotiations are structured in a way that enhances @entity2 's stability and is not merely a fig leaf for @entity6 and @entity49 troop departure			1
countering terrorism will be an important @entity6 interest after 2014			2
the @entity31 may have soured on @entity52 , but fully breaking with the terror group is not in the @entity31 's best interest			0
if negotiations give the insurgents de facto control of parts of the country , the @entity31 will at best play it both ways : with the jihadists and with the @entity6			1
negotiations of a status - of - forces agreement after 2014 will also be on the table between @entity1 and @entity3			1
immunity of @entity6 soldiers from @entity2 prosecution and control over detainees previously have been major sticking points , and any @entity2 release of @entity31 - linked prisoners will complicate that discussion			1
@entity1 has seemed determined to secure commitments from @entity4 to deliver military enablers until @entity2 support forces have built up			1
the @entity77 have improved but can not function without international enablers -- in areas such as air support , medevac , intelligence and logistical assets and maintenance -- for several years to come			0
but @entity4 has signaled that it is contemplating very small troop levels after 2014 , as low as 3,000			2
@entity0 reports that withdrawing all troops might even be considered			0
everyone is hedging their bets in light of the transition uncertainties and the real possibility of a major security meltdown after 2014			0
@entity2 army commanders are leaking intelligence and weapons to insurgents ; @entity2 families are sending one son to join the army , one to the @entity31 and one to the local warlord 's militia			1
with @entity2 president 's visit , nations ' post- 2014 future takes shape patronage networks pervade the @entity2 forces , and a crucial question is whether they can avoid splintering along ethnic and patronage lines after 2014			1
if security forces do fall apart , the chances of @entity31 control of large portions of the country and a civil war are much greater			0
@entity3 can use the summit to announce concrete measures -- such as providing enablers -- to demonstrate @entity6 commitment to heading off a security meltdown			1
the @entity6 and international security forces also need to strongly focus on countering the rifts within the @entity2 army			1
assisting the @entity2 army after 2014 is important			2
but even with better security , it is doubtful that @entity2 can be stable without improvements in its government			0
@entity2 's political system is preoccupied with the 2014 elections			0
corruption , serious crime , land theft and other usurpation of resources , nepotism , a lack of rule of law and exclusionary patronage networks afflict governance			0
@entity2 crave accountability and justice and resent the current mafia - like rule			0
whether the 2014 elections will usher in better leaders or trigger violent conflict is another huge question mark			0
emphasizing good governance , not sacrificing it to short - term military expediencies by embracing thuggish government officials , is as important as leaving @entity2 in a measured and unrushed way -- one that does n't jeopardize the fledgling institutional and security capacity that the country has managed to build up			2
@entity6 likely to keep thousands of troops in @entity2 after @entity49 forces leave @entity1 has been deaf and blind to the reality that reducing corruption , improving governance and allowing for a more pluralistic political system are essential for @entity2 's stability			1
his visit provides an opportunity to deliver the message again -- and strongly			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

@entity2 president @entity1 meeting with president @entity3 in @entity4 this week
@entity170 : @entity2 politics are corrupt ; army not ready for 2014 troop *pullout*
she says @entity31 , insurgents , splintered army , corrupt officials are all *jockeying* for power
@entity6 needs to commit to helping @entity2 security , she says , and insist corruption be wiped out
