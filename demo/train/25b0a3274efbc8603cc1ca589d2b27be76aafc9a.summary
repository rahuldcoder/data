-- in the years before penicillin came into wide use in the 1940s , medicine could n't do very much for many of the sickest patients			1
a hospital could keep you warm and provide food and nursing care , but as surgeon and writer @entity11 pointed out , in many cases the patient would do no better than if he or she had stayed home			1
in those days , doctors who mastered the few techniques that could make a difference , such as setting fractures and treating certain kinds of heart conditions , were seemingly all - powerful , @entity11 told the @entity24 conference in march			1
" a doctor could kind of know it all and do it all , " he said in an interview with @entity0 following his talk			0
doctors were rewarded for being cowboys , for being daring and self sufficient			0
today , the world of medicine promises and provides much more -- cures and care for many of the worst health problems people have			1
but doctors can no longer know everything and do everything			0
as medical knowledge has exploded , doctors increasingly must specialize in a field to absorb all the relevant information to treat a certain kind of illness			2
and a patient who goes to a hospital often winds up being treated and cared for by as many as 15 doctors , nurses and therapists , @entity11 said			1
the result ? " well , it 's been a disaster , " he said			0
" we have 40 percent of coronary artery disease patients who receive incomplete or inappropriate care , we have 2 million people pick up infections in hospitals because one of those people on that team failed to follow basic hygiene practices			2
" watch @entity11 's @entity68 " holding on to our streak of autonomy , each of us , we end up losing the patient in between , " he said			1
@entity11 , a surgeon at @entity73 in @entity74 , also is a researcher at @entity75 and a writer at @entity77			2
today doctors are still often rewarded and trained as cowboys , but @entity11 says what we really need are doctors who can function as members of a team , the way those in an auto racing pit crew work together to get vehicles back in the race			1
@entity68 : trial , error and the @entity92 complex @entity11 has been a pioneer in advocating the use of checklists by medical teams working together in surgery or on other procedures			1
" we 've had checklists in medicine for people we considered the lowest on the totem pole , but the idea that the surgeon would have to follow a checklist is anathema , " @entity11 said			1
but in fact , he added , " when checklists have been used to make sure even the best , most specialized doctors do n't miss key steps in providing care ... we 're finding that carefully designed checklists cut death rates in half in surgeries , that they can eliminate certain kinds of infections and that they can slash costs			1
" @entity11 has found reason to question the assumption that the most expensive care must be the best care			1
" what we 're discovering is that the best care , the places getting the best results , are often among the least expensive , " he said			2
in those places , doctors and nurses providing care function like teams			2
" we are going through a dramatic change where it 's no longer about what your doctor knows , it 's about what a team of doctors , nurses and others are able to do together			1
" @entity68 : doctors make mistakes -- can we talk about that ? these days @entity11 brings a checklist with him into the operating room			2
at first , it was a bit of a shock for him			0
" i did it reluctantly			0
i have been someone who believes , you know , do i need a checklist ? no ... but i did n't want to be a hypocrite			0
i was bringing them to @entity153 and @entity154 , so i started using a checklist myself			0
so that meant before the patient went to sleep we would do a series of checks -- not just , ' do we have the right person and the right side of the body ? ' but also , ' do we have a plan for what happens if this is a high - blood - loss case ? ' " before the incision , we 'd introduce ourselves by name because it would turn out often that you would have a team of people working together for the first time who may not know each other very well			0
" we discuss the plan in detail , and in doing these things i found from the very beginning that we were catching problems that we were missing otherwise			0
the anesthesiologist or the nurse was noticing things that i had missed			0
" i have not gotten through a week of surgery in three years using this kind of checklist without it catching something that was a danger for the patient or would have made the care better			0

@entity11 : @entity189 developed around the idea of the " cowboy " doctor
he says today 's doctors do n't know it all ; they have to specialize and be part of a team
he says strong teams in medicine get the best results and provide care more *cheaply*
@entity11 : today 's doctor should interact as if he were part of an auto racing pit crew
