the burgeoning field of 3 - d printing got a big boost tuesday night when president @entity3 highlighted it as something that could fuel new high - tech jobs in the @entity6			1
the shout - out in @entity3 's @entity9 address was perhaps the biggest public endorsement so far of a technology that has its roots in the 1970s , but has recently begun to boom on two fronts -- as an increasingly accessible consumer product and an industrial one that advocates say could change the face of manufacturing			1
@entity3 spoke about the @entity19 , a public - private partnership established in the hard - hit manufacturing city of @entity22 , @entity23 , last year to research how cutting - edge @entity25 printing technology can be moved from the research phase to day - to - day use			1
" a once - shuttered warehouse is now a state - of - the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3 - d printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything , " @entity3 said			1
the process of @entity25 ( also known by the clunkier " additive manufacturing " moniker ) uses computer - created digital models to create real - world objects -- everything from simple chess pieces to more complex objects such as functioning clocks			0
the printers follow the shape of the model by stacking layer upon layer of material to make the objects			0
@entity3 announced plans for three more manufacturing hubs where businesses will partner with the departments of @entity55 " to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high - tech jobs			1
" " and i ask this @entity60 to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made in @entity6 , " @entity3 said			2
@entity65 , the director of @entity19 , said the organization was " tremendously honored " to be mentioned by the president in such a high - profile speech			1
" it is rewarding to know that @entity19 's efforts to promote innovation and entrepreneurialism within the additive manufacturing sector is highly recognized and supported , " he said in a statement on the partnership 's website			0
while primarily a novelty among the tech - obsessed , 3 - d printing been used successfully for a variety of tasks , from making jewelry or medical supplies to larger projects in industrial design and engineering			1
a @entity87 architect has even announced plans to print an entire innovative building , piece by piece			0
that 's an outlier to be sure , but one that could signal things to come			0
three - dimensional printing has entered the public consciousness enough for @entity60 to be considering legislation banning people from making guns using the technology			0
a weapon made with a 3 - d printer could theoretically be formed from plastic , making it undetectable by traditional security measures			1
no one is known to have created an entire working firearm with a @entity25 printer , although usable parts of one reportedly have been printed			0
@entity111 , the most prominent maker of @entity25 printers that the public can buy , has cracked down on printed guns by enforcing terms on its website that prevent users from sharing blueprints for firearms			0
it 's also @entity111 that 's been at the forefront of of the move to put 3 - d printers in the hands of the general public			1
one of the biggest obstacles has been cost			0
but the company 's @entity127 desktop printer is now selling at a relatively accessible $ 2,200 , roughly the equivalent of a basic @entity132 @entity131 computer			2
@entity111 was listed this week as one of tech blog @entity135 's top 10 most innovative consumer tech companies with the likes of @entity132 , @entity138 and @entity139			0
ceo @entity140 said wednesday that the company 's goals are in line with those voiced tuesday by @entity3			2
" we created @entity111 to help innovators iterate faster , more affordably and ( to help them ) invent more , " @entity140 said			0
" we 're proud to be recognized by the president in his @entity9 address and we 're going to do our part to get it done			1
" while some consumers may have new visions of @entity25 printers in their garages , @entity3 was speaking mostly of the technology 's industrial potential			1
he pitched it as a way to prod what he called an encouraging recent trend : the return of tech - industry and other manufacturing jobs to the @entity6 @entity132 has announced it will begin manufacturing some of its imacs in the @entity6 this year , a fact @entity3 noted in his speech			2
@entity168 , the world 's second - largest pc maker , is starting a production line in @entity171 , and @entity172 is spending a whopping $ 5 billion to build an @entity174 plant to make its processors			2
analysts have said that as regulations and wages increase in places like @entity181 , and as @entity6 workers gain expertise in tech manufacturing , it will increasingly make more sense for @entity6 companies to keep their plants closer to home .			0

@entity3 's @entity9 address puts focus on *emerging* 3 - d printer field
president calls for 15 innovation centers like one promoting the printers in @entity23
consumers can buy 3 - d printers for the price of a high - end desktop
they 're being used to make everything from jewelry to buildings
