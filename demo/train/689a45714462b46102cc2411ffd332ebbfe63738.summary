-- along with " @entity1 , " " the purge : anarchy " may be one of the summer 's sequels that actually improves on the original			1
the follow - up to 2013 's horror flick " @entity9 , " " anarchy " raises the stakes just enough to get critics ' attention			1
as with its predecessor , the thriller is set in a near future when the @entity18 government allows for a 12 - hour " purge " : a time period when the populace can do all the awful , horrible stuff they want with no consequences			2
yep , that includes murder			0
though the first film was written from the perspective of a wealthy family barricaded in their home , the sequel shifts to where the action is : the violence outside			0
written and directed by @entity36 , who also oversaw " @entity9 , " " anarchy " follows a group of five individuals who find themselves stuck in the middle of the chaos , not wanting to maim anyone but just to stay alive			1
the result , says the @entity43 ' @entity42 , is a " satisfyingly creepy , blunt , down - and - dirty thriller , one of those follow - ups that improves on the original			0
" the @entity49 agreed , writing in its review that " ' @entity9 : anarchy ' efficiently exploits its high - concept premise while delivering far more visceral thrills than its predecessor			1
like it or not , a new franchise seems to have been born			0
" @entity56 would put " the purge : anarchy " directly into the " b - movie " category , noting that while " the film is rutted with plot holes , lapses in logic and tin - eared dialogue , " the " jarring action and outlandish premise of a lawless free - for - all are somehow riveting and inane in almost equal measures			2
" about those plot holes : one of the most obvious to the @entity69 is the movie 's concept that the annual purge has turned into something more akin to " @entity74 , " where the upper - class target the less fortunate for fun and the government uses the 12 - hour killing spree as an opportunity to weed those deemed undesirable out of society			2
it might make for a fun horror flick , but the logic does n't add up , the paper critiques			0
" this , of course , makes no economic sense , since killing your own workers is an even stupider business strategy than underpaying them -- and a sure - fire path to the poorhouse , " the @entity69 review says			0
" the film defies one of the fundamental rules of capitalism : exploitation of the proletariat may be well and good , but do n't execute them all			0
" story troubles aside , " @entity9 : anarchy " is expected to do fairly well at the box office on opening weekend			1
with $ 2.61 million in the bag from thursday night showings , predictions are circling a box office haul of about $ 30 million come monday .			1

" the purge : anarchy " is the sequel to 2013 's " @entity9 "
the horror movie has received decent reviews
*analysts* predict it could earn up to $ 30 million its opening weekend
