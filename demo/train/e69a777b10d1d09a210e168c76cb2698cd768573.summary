the $ 4 trillion budget president @entity1 sent @entity2 on monday is his blueprint for reviving " middle class opportunity			1
" liberals are thrilled by the redistributive thrust of the president 's budget -- it would hit affluent @entity10 with a battery of new tax hikes , totaling $ 2 trillion over the next decade , and use the proceeds to finance substantial tax cuts for low and middle income families			1
however , this has , of course , scandalized tax - averse congressional @entity18 , who echo @entity20 chairman @entity19 in denouncing the @entity1 budget as an exercise in " envy economics			1
" given the partisan stalemate in @entity26 , many pundits therefore view the @entity28 budget as a purely political statement intended to frame the 2016 presidential debate			1
next , the @entity2 will produce a conservative alternative , and each side will spend the next two years accusing the other of waging class warfare			2
except that the federal government actually does need a budget , especially one that reinforces the economy 's gathering momentum			1
the one thing both parties seem to agree on is that reversing middle class stagnation is the nation 's top priority			2
what @entity10 needs more than anything else is a long stretch of robust economic growth , something we have not seen since the 1990s , when both the growth and unemployment rates averaged about 4 percent a year			0
it 's true that stronger growth alone ultimately may not suffice to restore mass upward mobility			0
in the absence of real wealth creation , however , a politics of redistribution can only sustain a fleeting illusion of shared prosperity			0
although it does n't go far enough in this direction , the @entity1 budget does contain some important growth - enhancing features			1
for example , it proposes to spend $ 478 billion to repair and modernize @entity10 's aging roads , airports and other infrastructure over the next six years			0
this initiative would be funded by a one - time , 14 % tax on offshore profits , which the @entity28 considers more likely to attract @entity2 support than raising the gas tax			0
the @entity1 budget also calls for a 6 % increase in federal r&d funding , especially for biomedical research			1
public investment that replenishes @entity10 's depleted stock of physical and knowledge capital is crucial to putting the @entity10 economy back on a high - growth path			0
in addition , the president wants funding for seven more manufacturing institutes that enlist companies , governments and universities to put @entity10 in the vanguard of advanced manufacturing , including 3 - d printing			1
there 's also more money for career training and on - the - job apprenticeships , as well as an intriguing @entity96 aimed at spurring enterprise in impoverished communities			0
also good for the economy is @entity1 's call to ease the sequester 's suffocating grip on discretionary spending			1
his budget would raise next year 's spending cap by $ 74 billion , to be divided equally between defense and domestic spending			1
this would reduce the fiscal drag produced by deep cutbacks in current spending -- an untimely dose of austerity that the @entity114 says shaved more than a point off the economy 's growth rate			0
it would also pit penny pinching republicans against @entity10 military leaders and @entity2 hawks , led by @entity124 chairman @entity123 , who warns that the caps are weakening the nation 's defense			0
the controversial centerpiece of the president 's budget is a grab bag of big tax changes that take from the rich to give to , well , everyone else			1
these include a minimum tax on millionaires ; a higher capital gains tax ( including on inherited wealth ) ; and limits on the value of itemized deductions claimed by the wealthy			0
there 's also a new tax on the nation 's 100 largest banks			0
surging revenues would pay for an array of costly tax breaks for families with modest incomes , including a tax credit for second earners , an expansion of the @entity154 for workers without children and a tripling of the child tax credit			0
but while there 's no doubt the overall effect would be to make federal taxes more progressive , it would also make the code even more insanely complicated			0
unfortunately , @entity1 's budget stops short of a comprehensive tax reform that would close loopholes for both individuals and corporations and use the added revenues to reduce rates for all taxpayers			1
most economists believe that junking , or at least limiting , a host of special preferences and tax breaks would reduce economic distortions , promote more efficient use of capital , and generally make federal taxes fairer and simpler			0
nonetheless , the president 's proposals for reforming business taxes could be more appealing to @entity18			2
the budget proposes to cut the top corporate rate from 35 % to 28 % , which would help @entity10 businesses compete globally			2
president @entity1 also calls for a new 19 % minimum tax on global profits , which would reduce the risk that @entity10 companies would have to pay tax twice on those profits			1
finally , the @entity1 budget does disappointingly little to reorient @entity10 fiscal policy around investment and growth			1
as @entity199 , a veteran fiscal analyst writes in his invaluable book , " @entity201 , " decisions made by dead or retired politicians have radically constrained contemporary lawmakers ' freedom of action			2
for most of @entity10 history , politicians could spend or cut taxes confident in the knowledge that economic growth would make budget deficits temporary and create fiscal space for new initiatives			2
but now , says @entity199 , the cost of maintaining the government 's cumulative commitments exceeds expected revenues			0
@entity2 , in short , is wearing fiscal handcuffs			0
lawmakers ca n't launch fresh initiatives to tackle contemporary problems without either piling on new debt or reneging on old commitments ( to spend more , or tax less )			0
what 's more , as the nation ages , more of our resources are channeled into automatic , formula - driven spending on current consumption -- mainly through @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 -- leaving fewer dollars to invest in children and families or future economic growth			2
no one expects president @entity1 to solve this problem unilaterally , especially with a @entity18 so addled by anti-government populism that it ca n't distinguish between consumption spending and genuine economic and social investment			1
but neither can @entity10 afford a federal budget so paralyzed by old promises and interest group gridlock that it is essentially a blueprint for national decline			2
that 's why progressives need a strategy for reclaiming their fiscal freedom -- and the ability to invest in @entity10 's future .			1
