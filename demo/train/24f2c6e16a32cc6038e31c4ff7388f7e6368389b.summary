-- you 'll flip head over heels for this summer 's bumper crop of new roller coasters			1
" it 's going to be a crazy good year , " says @entity5 , an economist and volunteer public relations director for @entity7 , an international group with 5,000 members			2
along with a couple of petrifying new record - breakers ( highest , fastest and other superlatives go with coasters like tracks and inversions ) , @entity11 amusement parks are also investing in new technologies and family friendly thrill rides			0
" in the ' 70s , parks were pulling out their kiddie rides to make room for the teen - drawing bigger , faster , stomach - tightening rides , " @entity5 says			0
" this summer , there are plenty of those , but we 're also seeing a nice balance in the major installments			2
" here are 10 top new roller coasters you 'll be screaming about for a long time : @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 this new wooden coaster that debuts may 24 breaks three -- count ' em , three -- world records			1
it has the longest drop , the steepest drop and goes faster than any other wooden coaster			1
it also flips riders head over heels in two inversions that could make the inevitable air - time and 180 - degree zero - g roll seem kinda tame			0
daredevil riders , with bated breath , have been keeping tabs on construction via the @entity53 on the park 's @entity55 site			2
sixflags.com / greatamerica bells and whistles : length : 3,100 feet @entity60 : 165 feet insanity : a 180 - foot vertical drop that plunges 85 degrees into an underground tunnel best places to experience @entity66 culture @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 like the mythological creature whose screams break glass , this new $ 24 million coaster with the same name is sure to terrify anyone who gets near			1
@entity77 , which opened april 18 , is billed as the longest inverted coaster in the world			1
and , yes , inverted means upside down			2
it also has a curved drop , a dive loop , a zero - g roll , a batwing , an outside loop spiral and an inline - roll			0
after months of watching a live videocam of the purple coaster 's death - defying construction , eager fans have already raised some $ 65,000 for a @entity92 charity supporting kids with life - threatening illnesses by signing up for the two - hour marathon the night before the park officially opens for 2014			1
visitkingsisland.com / banshee bells and whistles : length : 4,124 feet @entity101 : 170 feet insanity : seven inversions and a 170 - foot heartline finale @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 ever since october 1901 , when a 63 - year - old @entity110 school teacher survived a plunge down @entity112 in a wooden barrel , daredevils have been dreaming up schemes to ride down the 167 - foot monster waterfall			1
on may 23 , @entity106 is unveiling a waterslide / hypercoaster that 's actually several feet taller			1
and while it 's illegal to mount an expedition down @entity112 these days ( park officials did n't particularly enjoy dealing with mangled bodies ) , anyone with the guts to climb the 264 stairs can make the 17 - story drop on the @entity125 , which means insane in @entity126			1
the new attraction will be the world 's tallest water slide			1
@entity130 bells and whistles : length : straight down with a second five - story slope @entity134 : 17 stories insanity : taller than @entity112 , 40 % taller and 20 % faster than its closest competitor @entity138 at @entity139 , @entity140 living up to its name , this hair - raising new coaster that opened february 18 has a turn that banks to the outside , an unheard of gravity - defying feature , even among coaster collectors			1
eleven - year - old @entity150 of @entity151 , @entity152 , who won a contest to be one of the first four passengers , said , " i was out of my seat more than i was in it			0
the first drop was so crazy i accidentally said a bad word			0
" do n't worry , @entity150 , with each car 's built - in sound system playing cheesy hip - hop and rock , your mother probably did n't hear			2
adventuredome.com / elloco / bells and whistles : length : 1,300 feet @entity170 : 90 feet insanity : it banks outside at a 45 - degree angle , about 44 degrees further than the average comfort zone			0
the @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 just when you thought it was safe to go back to @entity177 , a new $ 10 million steel thunderbolt is opening on the site of the original wooden thunderbolt that terrified thrill seekers from the 1920s through the ' 80s			1
if you saw " @entity188 , " it was the coaster under which @entity190 's fictional character grew up			1
thunderbolt 2.0 is the park 's first to be built since the famous , still - in - operation @entity193			1
@entity194 , opening in may , starts with a jaw - dropping 90 - degree vertical drop , followed by a 100 - foot vertical loop , an 80 - foot , zero - g roll , a 112 - degree over-banked turn and a custom heartline dive			0
@entity201 bells and whistles : length : 2,233 feet @entity205 : 115 feet insanity : a 90 - degree plunge flying @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 most parks would have given up years ago			0
but this family - owned amusement park was so determined to recreate the legendary wooden coaster that @entity216 barnstorming pilot @entity215 brought to @entity11 in the 1920s that it spent 7Â½ years melding its old - school thrills ( read , laxer safety standards ) with today 's high - tech safety regulations			1
judging by the stunned reaction from riders in last october 's sneak preview / soft opening , it was well worth every trip back to the old drawing board			2
on april 26 , the park opens for @entity230 ' much - anticipated full debut season			0
@entity231 bells and whistles : length : 1,200 feet @entity235 : 50 feet insanity : you 're in a wooden chute without any tracks making very tight turns			0
@entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 @entity244 herself was there to cut the ribbon on this new coaster that debuted march 22			2
although it 's classified in coaster parlance as a " family ride " -- and indeed riders need only be 39 inches tall to board the splashy red fire trucks -- this innovative new ride includes explosions , fireworks , more twists than an @entity259 novel and enough special effects that it could get nominated for that category in next year 's @entity262			1
@entity263 bells and whistles : length : 2,427 feet speed : 34.5 mph height : 12 stories insanity : once @entity270 explodes , you ride backwards all the way to the station			0
@entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 after a five - year hiatus and a $ 50 million renovation , this amusement park , formerly a part of the @entity279 brand , debuts may 24 with the new steel @entity283			0
joining @entity284 and @entity285 , the @entity286 that were originally called the @entity287 until the rock group of the same name threatened to sue , @entity283 has a sleek new car design that sends riders on a negative force camelback that will have them screaming , " @entity293 ! " @entity294 bells and whistles : length : 2,500 feet @entity205 : 100 feet insanity : an 80 - degree , near - vertical drop @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 you might be tempted to sniff at the stats ( it is , after all , an all - ages coaster ) , but this new steel coaster at @entity300 's @entity308 does a lot more than defy @entity311 's laws			1
according to @entity313 , the ride 's creative director , this roller coaster - plus has music and interactive elements , goes outside through a forest and inside through the dwarf 's mine and is unlike any ride @entity300 has ever seen			2
@entity321 bells and whistles : vultures : 2 dwarfs : 7 jewels : diamonds , emeralds , rubies and more insanity : the car 's platform rocks back and forth			2
@entity334 - @entity333 , @entity335 , @entity336 @entity270 ? bad ? not so much			0
but when you figure that the @entity333 customer base is 12 and under ( oh yeah , and their parents ) , a brand new wooden roller coaster that catches air is pretty extreme			0
and because @entity344 ' numerous twists and turns are built into such a tight space and because it moves at a surprisingly frenetic pace , @entity5 , of @entity7 , claims this new dinosaur - led coaster packs an impressive wallop			0
with 100 inches of snow in @entity336 this year , fingers are crossed that @entity353 , the dinosaur , and his team will be ready to rock and roll by the park 's opening on may 24			0
@entity358 bells and whistles : length : 1,242 feet speed : 35 mph height : 40 feet insanity : 12 moments of airtime			0
