-- can a handful of ancient copper coins from a once - opulent but now abandoned corner of @entity4 change what we know about @entity8 history ? a team of researchers is on a mission to find out			1
with its glittering wealth , busy harbor and coral stone buildings , the island of @entity13 rose to become the premier commercial post of coastal @entity4 around the 1300s , controlling much of the @entity20 trade with the continent 's hinterland			1
situated in present - day southern @entity24 , during its heyday @entity23 hosted traders from as far away as @entity27 , who would exchange gold , ivory and iron from southern @entity4 's interior for @entity33 pottery and @entity20 textiles as well as perfumes , porcelains and spices from the @entity38			1
but the @entity23 's heyday came to a crashing end in the early 1500s with the arrival of the @entity43 who sacked the city in their bid to dominate the trade routes between eastern @entity4 and @entity48			1
from then on , @entity23 never managed to recover its greatness			0
with its trading network gradually eclipsing , the once flourishing city started to decline in importance			0
it was eventually deserted in the 19th century , its crumbling , @entity54 - protected ruins offering today a glimpse of its glorious past			0
but interest in this nearly forgotten @entity4 city has resurfaced lately thanks to the mystery surrounding a remarkable discovery thousands of miles away , in a long - abandoned , remote chain of small islands near @entity8 's @entity65			1
astonishing discovery back in 1944 , an @entity8 soldier named @entity68 was assigned to one of the uninhabited but strategically positioned @entity70 to man a radar station			1
one day , whilst fishing on the beach during his spare time , he discovered nine coins buried in the sand			2
@entity68 stored them in a tin until 1979 , when he wondered if they might be worth something and sent them to be identified			0
four of the coins were found to belong to the @entity82 , with one of them being from the late 17th century			2
but the rest of them were identified as originating from @entity13 , believed to date back to the 1100s			1
the sultanate started minting its own currency in the 11th century			0
read this : the dark history of @entity91 " it 's a very fascinating discovery , " says @entity92 , an @entity93 anthropologist			0
" @entity23 coins have only ever been found outside of the @entity13 region on two occasions , " he explains			1
" a single coin was found in the ruins of great @entity100 and one coin was found in the @entity33 , in what is now @entity103 , but nowhere else			0
and yet , here is this handful of them in northern @entity8 , this is the astonishing thing			2
" re-write history ? according to history textbooks , @entity109 explorers arrived in @entity8 from @entity111 at least 60,000 years ago			2
the first @entity112 widely known to have set foot on the continent was @entity116 navigator @entity115 in 1606 , more than 160 years before captain @entity117 arrived at @entity8 's south - eastern coast to claim the territory for the @entity121 empire			1
so how did the five coins from distant @entity23 wind up in the isolated @entity70 ? was a shipwreck involved ? could it be that the @entity43 , who had looted @entity23 in 1505 , reached the @entity8 shores with coins from @entity4 in their possession ? or was it that @entity131 sailors , renowned as expert navigators all across the sea route between @entity27 and @entity4 , were hired by traders from the @entity38 to navigate their dhows ? these are the kind of questions that @entity92 now hopes to answer as he bids to unravel the mystery of how the coins , which are currently stored in @entity141 's @entity140 , were found in this part of the world			1
" we have five separate hypotheses we 're looking to test about how these coins got there , each one quite different from the other , " says @entity92			0
on july 15 , he will lead an eight - member team of archaeologists , historians and scientists to the area where @entity68 discovered the coins			0
read this : @entity4 roots of the human family tree " this is an initial survey ; if we find something then we 'll prepare for a more detailed and focused exploration in specific areas , " says the @entity8 professor			1
" we are interested in a more accurate portrayal of @entity8 history that is currently allowed in textbooks			0
" the team will embark on its quest for answers equipped with a nearly 70 - year - old map on which @entity68 had marked with an x the spot where he found the coins			2
@entity92 , who was sent the map before @entity68 's death in 1991 , says he first tried to mount an expedition to the @entity70 in the early 1990s but at the time he 'd failed to gather funding			0
" in 1992 there was a very limited interest for such a venture , " he says			0
" but we maintained an interest in the @entity23 connection because it was such a famous place in its day -- from the 1100s to the 1300s it was the most prominent port in the entire east @entity4 coast , bigger than @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187			1
" " if you bought these coins in a shop in @entity13 , you could probably get them for a few dollars , " says @entity92			2
" but in northern @entity8 , these are priceless in terms of their historical value			0
