-- a boiling primary battle in @entity2 headed to a runoff early wednesday as two @entity4 running for @entity5 failed to reach the 50 % threshold to clinch the @entity4 nomination			1
though lt. gov. @entity9 led the crowded field of candidates , he narrowly failed to cross the 50 % mark required to secure the nomination and avoid a july 31 runoff			1
@entity9 's challenger in the runoff will be @entity18 favorite @entity17 , a former solicitor general with strong support from national groups and high - profile conservative leaders			1
with 99.6 % of precincts counted , @entity9 held 48 % of the vote to 30 % for @entity17			1
other contenders in tuesday 's primary included former @entity27 mayor @entity26 and @entity29 broadcaster @entity28			0
neither candidate will forge ahead to compete in the runoff			0
the @entity2 race is particularly important because the balance of power in the @entity5 could shift in 2012			0
it is also another test in the staying power and influence of tea party groups and their political strategy to focus more on congressional races than on the presidential campaign			0
the race , held to replace retiring sen. @entity43 , has seen a @entity2 - sized level of spending , as well			2
according to @entity47 reports , more than $ 31.6 million had been dumped in the @entity4 primary as of may 9 , with more than half coming from @entity9 's team			1
while @entity17 's campaign has spent more than $ 4 million , the underdog has been boosted by a surge of outside spending			1
the fiscal conservative organization @entity54 has spent more than $ 2 million , and the tea party oriented @entity56 has also been heavy on the ground in get - out - the - vote efforts on behalf of @entity17			1
members of the @entity60 , a leading arm of the grass - roots movement , have traversed the state by bus in support of @entity17			2
adding to his rising star power , the former solicitor general landed endorsements from former @entity4 presidential candidate @entity68 and tea party stalwart @entity69 , two big voices in the conservative movement			0
@entity9 , meanwhile , touts his support from 2008 presidential candidate and former @entity76 gov. @entity75			1
@entity2 gov. @entity77 has also been vocal for his no. 2			0
in a recent commercial , @entity77 urged voters to turn out for @entity9 , insisting he was the true conservative in the race			1
given that @entity77 and @entity9 have worked together for almost a decade , some political observers characterize the race as a possible referendum on @entity77 , the state 's longest - serving governor in history			1
but @entity77 brushed off the idea on friday , telling @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity89 that while national conservatives may be making noise in the race against @entity9 , the local movement will stand for the lieutenant governor			1
" there 's , you know , people who come from out of state and make their endorsements known , " @entity77 said			0
" but @entity2 conservatives are lining up behind @entity9			2
" @entity9 opponents criticize the candidate as being part of the @entity4 establishment and having too many years in government under his belt			2
before becoming lieutenant governor , @entity9 served as @entity108 in the late ' 90s			2
hitting back , @entity9 points to his private sector experience as the co-founder of @entity111 , an energy company based in @entity112			2
he also boasts his role in pushing for socially conservative legislation in the state , including a recent bill that requires women to see a sonogram and go through a 24 - hour waiting period before having an abortion			0
@entity9 has attacked @entity17 , who is of @entity122 descent , as a supporter of amnesty and a member of the @entity126 and the @entity127			1
@entity17 has also been on the defense over criticism that he works for a firm representing a @entity132 company being sued for patent violations			2
the candidate has repeatedly shot down both claims , arguing he has long been an opponent of illegal immigration and saying he is not the lead lawyer in the patent lawsuit			0
the @entity126 also fired back against @entity9 's latest ad , saying @entity17 has never had any position with the group and faulted the ad as dishonest			1
" the @entity126 support using free market and limited government principles to strengthen border security , restore a functional legal immigration system , and promote patriotic assimilation			0
if @entity9 wants to deceitfully lump us in with leftist organizations that actually do promote amnesty , then all he is accomplishing is demonstrating to @entity2 voters how intellectually shallow he is , " @entity148 , the organization 's president , said in a statement			0
on the @entity158 side , former state rep. @entity155 and political operative @entity156 are competing for their party 's nomination			0
@entity2 has not elected a @entity162 to the @entity5 in more than two decades			0
political handicappers @entity163 and @entity165 both rate the open seat as safe for @entity4 .			0

lt. gov. @entity9 fails to get 50 % of primary vote
that forces a runoff with @entity18 favorite @entity17
@entity174 reports put spending in the hotly contended race at $ 31.6 million
