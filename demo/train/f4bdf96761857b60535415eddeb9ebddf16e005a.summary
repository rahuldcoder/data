@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity6 town north of @entity0 that has been surrounded by @entity8 for more than two months came under heavy attack on monday , local police and residents said			1
at about 9 a.m. , a suicide bomber in a seized military humvee struck a dirt berm that was built as part of the defenses around the southern part of @entity16			1
the bombing cleared the way for a second suicide bomber in another @entity11 to drive into the center of the town and strike the market area			1
at least nine people were killed and more than 70 others were wounded in the two bombings			0
. @entity26 , a resident of @entity16 and a local journalist , explained the situation to @entity2 from inside the town			2
he said @entity8 seized the town in june , but on june 18 , the @entity33 tribe , along with the local police , pushed @entity8 out of the southern part of the town and took control of the area , while @entity8 remained in control of the northern part			1
since june , @entity26 said , the southern part of @entity16 has been besieged and under constant attack by @entity8			1
local officials have counted 72 attacks , including hundreds of mortar and artillery shell strikes			0
the attack on monday , he said , was the worst since the @entity8 offensive began			2
on july 16 , he said , @entity8 blew up a vital bridge connecting @entity16 to the predominantly @entity52 town of @entity53 about 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) to the west			1
@entity55 said the bridge was a lifeline for the town and even though @entity53 is a @entity52 town , its local officials and residents have supported and assisted residents of @entity16 throughout the siege			1
he described a dire humanitarian situation in the part of @entity16 that has no medical care and having to move people to @entity53 for treatment there			2
the destruction of the bridge has forced them to use small boats to move the injured and get supplies , which has been very difficult , he said			0
@entity55 said the people of his town and its police force are determined to continue the fight , with women and young boys taking up arms to defend their home			0
" we lived through a bitter experience in 2006 under these people			0
they did not distinguish between security forces and civilians			0
they massacred people then and they will do it again			0
... we will not allow them to enter the town			0
@entity90 will continue its resistance until the last breath , over our dead bodies will they enter this town			0
" @entity55 's wife and 16 - year - old daughter were wounded when an artillery shell hit close to their home last week			0
he said local officials have repeatedly asked for government support but have received only " empty promises			1
" " in the name of humanity we call on president @entity108 , who says they are the protectors of humanity -- where are your planes , your missiles ? " " why this terrorism , why are our children being killed , our homes destroyed ? we call on the @entity118 people to pressure their government to help us			2
" a number of people in the room with him also said they want the @entity118 to help them , saying even if it 's @entity118 troops , " we welcome them			2
" they accused the @entity1 government of a double standard , apparently a reference to the fact that about a week ago , @entity1 troops broke the @entity8 siege in the town of @entity135 , which is predominantly @entity52 .			1
