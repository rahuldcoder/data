@entity1 's conflict erupted in march 2011 when president @entity5 's @entity4 minority - dominated government launched a crackdown against a predominantly @entity8 protest movement that grew into an uprising with an armed resistance			1
one year later , what is the situation , and what may happen next ? how did the unrest start ? the spark began in the southern @entity1 city of @entity17 with the arrests of at least 15 children for painting anti-government graffiti			1
outrage over the arrests and the government 's humiliating and violent reactions to their complaints emboldened the opposition and helped it spread			2
by mid-march protests were occurring across @entity1			1
how @entity1 's unrest unfolded the government launched a full - scale siege on @entity17 april 25 , with other towns , including @entity32 -- the country 's third - largest city -- following			1
@entity35 arrests unfolded and tales of torture spread across the country			0
the protest movement grew and solidified			0
@entity40 , director of the @entity41 , believes " it 's conceivable that if the events did n't happen in @entity17 , " the uprising " might not have occurred			2
" but the deep - seated political and economic reasons underlining @entity1 discontent was an omen			1
protest in @entity1 was " going to happen " at some point , @entity40 said			1
initially , protesters wanted basic reforms , more freedoms , a multi-party political system and an end to emergency law			1
the regime introduced some reforms , but they were too little , too late			2
protesters now want the @entity5 regime out and true democratic elections			1
@entity60 has been in power since 2000 ; his father , @entity62 , ruled @entity1 for three decades			1
read @entity5 : president defined by violence what is happening now ? the 12 - month - old conflict shows no sign of abating			1
more than 8,000 people have now been killed , including many women and children , the @entity69 said this month			1
opposition activists put the toll at more than 9,000			0
thousands more have been arrested or have disappeared , while about 30,000 @entity1 have fled to neighboring countries			1
@entity77 can not independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in @entity1 because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists			1
but reports from inside @entity1 indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking @entity5 's ouster			1
@entity60 's regime routinely insists " armed terrorist groups " are behind the bloodshed in @entity1			1
and the rebels ' tactics seem to be changing too			0
videos show that jihad appears to have come to @entity1 with attacks on government forces that closely resemble jihadist tactics that are the hallmark of @entity100			1
how has @entity5 survived ? many analysts admit they under - estimated the @entity1 leader 's powers of survival			1
" @entity60 proved us wrong on multiple grounds and is far more durable than we thought , " @entity105 , professor of international relations at the @entity107 , told @entity77			0
" he 's not only weathered the offensive and absorbed the shocks , but he 's gone on the attack to try to crush the armed wing of the uprising			2
" unlike former @entity116 and @entity117 leaders , @entity118 and @entity119 , who were both deposed after uprisings in their countries , @entity60 has adapted to the situation in his , @entity105 said , and is in no immediate danger			0
" his security apparatus has held its ground , and there have been few defections from the top elite in the military and security services			0
" so the momentum the @entity1 rebels had during the @entity133 has slowed			1
one reason was because of the assumption that the regime would not use the level of force it has , said @entity140 , lecturer in international relations at @entity142			0
" @entity143 had to fabricate the existence of an armed opposition in @entity1 , but the emergence of such groups gave the regime pretext to crack down so heavily			1
" what external factors are in play ? the @entity1 regime has come under international pressure to stop the crackdown -- the @entity69 , the @entity154 , the @entity155 and some members of the @entity157 have called for president @entity5 to step down -- but so far there has been little action			1
many @entity162 countries have imposed sanctions , but the @entity164 has failed to agree on a resolution calling for @entity5 to go			1
@entity167 and @entity162 diplomats voiced their support for a draft resolution calling for a halt to the crackdown , but representatives from @entity172 and @entity173 vetoed it in october			0
@entity172 -- which , like @entity173 , is one of the five veto - wielding permanent members of the @entity164 -- has said it is concerned about a @entity1 civil war and does not want @entity5 ousted			1
it has proposed its own draft resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both @entity5 and the opposition			1
@entity1 's neighbors are concerned about an influx of refugees			1
@entity187 's @entity186 called for @entity5 to step down , the @entity157 suspended @entity1 's membership , and @entity189 , one of @entity1 's largest trading partners , imposed sanctions and threatened to cut off @entity1 's electricity			1
but crucially @entity196 's @entity195 leadership remains loyal to @entity5 , who is an @entity4 , an offshoot of @entity195 that is in a minority in @entity1			1
" @entity1 is caught in the middle of a regional crisis , " said @entity105			2
" on the one hand there 's @entity196 and on the other , @entity202 and the @entity203 countries			0
one must also never under - estimate the lengths that @entity172 will go to in standing behind the regime			0
" with videos posted on social media providing much impetus for the uprising , @entity211 's help is vital , analysts say			2
" @entity196 is now supplying crucial intelligence on rebels who are posting @entity219 videos as well as finance , " said @entity140			0
" @entity172 and @entity173 are also providing diplomatic cover -- so we can see how @entity5 has deftly repositioned his international alliances to stay in power			2
" is there any prospect of military intervention ? last year , the @entity164 voted to impose a no - fly zone in @entity117 and use " all necessary measures " to protect its people from @entity119			0
but there is no such appetite for similar action against @entity1			2
" the @entity173 and @entity172 are dead set against ( intervention ) , " said @entity77 's @entity234 in a recent blog post			0
" so it could n't happen through the @entity69			0
there would be effectively a kind of unilateral or @entity243 operation with no international legitimacy			0
" and while there are calls for robust military intervention , that could be the worst possible thing to do , according to @entity249 , who runs the international affairs program at the @entity251 in @entity252			0
" i think foreign military intervention would probably be catastrophic , and to hear @entity154 suggest this is to think back what they did in @entity257 and what an extraordinary catastrophe that has been , " @entity249 said on " @entity258			0
" experts point out that while the opposition groups in @entity117 were relatively united and organized , the same can not be said for rebels in @entity1			2
@entity60 also continues to hold a vice-like grip on the country 's security apparatus , and has the support of the army , one that is much stronger , better equipped and more unified than the one in @entity117			0
geography must also be taken into account when considering intervention in @entity1			2
@entity117 was relatively easy last year : most targets were near the @entity275 coast and @entity243 air bases in @entity277			0
but @entity1 has a much smaller coastline than @entity117 ( roughly 119 miles vs. 1,110 miles ) , and neighboring countries probably wo n't be so accommodating for supplies , troops or anything else needed in a possible mission			2
is the opposition united ? weapons are flowing in , refugees are fleeing , but there seems little in the way of an organized @entity1 opposition with which to work			2
and while @entity292 neighbors such as @entity202 and @entity293 want @entity5 's removal , this seems more of an opportunistic @entity296 strategy			1
among the resistance forces are apparently some radical @entity8 fighters , perhaps @entity100 itself , and others whose ascension to power would likely cause a further crisis , with millions of @entity303 and other religious minorities fleeing from the region			0
the failure of opposition groups to unite is the main reason the uprising has stalled , analysts say			0
" if i was the opposition , i 'd look to the longer term , " said @entity105			0
" they 've presented a narrative to the outside world that @entity5 's days are numbered			1
they 've spent time trying to get military intervention but not enough on unifying themselves into a cohesive group			0
they believe they 're going to win in the end but at the moment they 're divided both in and outside @entity1			2
" the opposition has failed so far to win the support of wider sections of @entity1 society , most observers believe			2
" the rebels have n't proved a credible force either politically or militarily , " said @entity140			0
" the regime is easily a match for them on the battlefield , but crucially the @entity8 merchant classes in cities like @entity339 have remained neutral			0
" what might happen next ? the conflict is likely to continue with neither side able to deliver a knockout blow			0
analysts believe @entity5 is secure in the short - term with regional backing from @entity196 and wider diplomatic cover from @entity172 and @entity173			1
but even if it defeats the opposition , @entity140 said it is unclear how the regime can repackage itself			0
" it 's very difficult to see how the opposition is going to topple @entity5 , but one must ask if he has alienated his core constituents so much that he can not rule by consent ? " he asked			1
and the longer the conflict continues , the more fundamentalist @entity358 elements will get involved , analysts say			0
" if it goes on some @entity1 will turn to jihadi - style tactics , " said @entity105			2
" i would n't be surprised if it eventually goes the way of @entity257 although it 's important to stress that the bulk of the armed response now is local @entity1 , not @entity100			1
" in a recent blog posting , @entity234 pointed out that @entity5 drew an unfortunate lesson from the @entity133 : " do n't waiver ; do n't make concessions ; do n't show weakness			2
in @entity5 's eyes , @entity116 's @entity118 vacillated in his response to protests and ended up in prison			1
@entity117 's @entity119 was n't ruthless enough and ended up dead			0
@entity60 has chosen to be brutal			0
" however he said in the longer term @entity5 's position is weak			1
for this reason , @entity234 said : " the government will not be able to fully suppress this revolt			0
the opposition will prove unable to completely overturn the government			0
the stalemate could go on for a long , long time			0

protests across @entity1 began on march 15 , 2011 after children 's arrest for graffiti
@entity389 initially wanted reform ; now it wants regime out and democratic elections
more than 8,000 people have been killed , including many women and children
analysts say president @entity5 is safe in short term but less so further *ahead*
