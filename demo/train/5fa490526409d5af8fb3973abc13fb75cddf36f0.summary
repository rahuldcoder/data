-- perhaps somebody forgot to tell @entity2 that the @entity3 were last week			1
@entity2 's extraordinary post-match performance wednesday managed to combine the good , the bad and the ugly as the @entity8 manager launched a scathing attack on his employers and club 's supporters before revealing he will quit at the end of this season			1
here was @entity2 , the victim			2
here was the man in the middle of one of football 's most high - pressure jobs being circled by an army of critics			2
perhaps the adrenaline kicked in			0
perhaps he had just had enough			0
it was fight or flight			0
now he will await his fate , with the @entity29 club 's billionaire owner @entity27 -- who has employed nine managers in 10 years -- expected to take note			1
foreign owners in @entity34 football : the good the bad and the ugly since @entity2 walked into @entity37 last november , the former @entity36 boss has been a sitting duck			2
protests , placards , songs about former managers from the stands -- even the most genial of men would have found their patience challenged			0
replacing a @entity8 favorite and @entity47 - winning manager in @entity49 was never going to be easy , but for @entity2 , it has been a losing battle			1
out of the @entity47 , beaten in the country 's third cup competition by @entity54 and 19 points off the league leader , @entity8 's season is in danger of collapsing			1
contrast that with the fact that the @entity62 were third and four points behind then leader @entity58 when @entity49 was given his marching orders			0
the @entity64 is not seen as salvation -- not at least by those who sit in the stands with their thumbs pointed downwards in @entity2 's direction			1
more woe for @entity8 boss @entity2 then there 's the speculation surrounding alleged disagreements with key players and the constant scrutiny of his side 's failings , and it 's easy to see why @entity2 has found life in west @entity81 so difficult			1
not even wednesday 's 2 - 0 win over second division @entity83 in the @entity84 -- which earned a quarterfinal clash with @entity86 -- could please the traveling @entity8 fans , who once again voiced their displeasure at the man they call the " interim manager			1
" " i have been in charge in football for 26 years , " he told reporters			0
" i have won the @entity47 , won the @entity95 , the @entity84 , the @entity96 , the @entity98 league twice , nine trophies , all the trophies you can win at club level			1
" a group of fans , they are not doing any favors for the team when they are singing and wasting time preparing banners			2
" @entity2 takes over @entity8 while @entity2 accepted the post until the end of the season , he hit out at the use of the term " interim manager " and the club 's insistence on using the title			1
" it 's because someone made a mistake , " he added			2
" they put my title " interim manager " and i will leave at the end of the season , so they ( the fans ) do n't need to waste time with me			1
" they have to concentrate on supporting the team , that 's what they have to do			0
in the end , they are not doing any favors to the club , to the rest of the fans and to the players			1
" every game they continue singing and they continue preparing banners , they are wasting time			0
what they have to do is support the team			0
" if we can not achieve what we expect to achieve , that is to be in the top four and be in the @entity47 for next year , i will leave			0
they will stay in the @entity64			0
" i am the manager			0
i will manage the players and i will make decisions			0
i will leave anyway -- i 'm interim , as they say -- so they 're wasting their time			2
" how much longer @entity2 will have on screen in his current role is up for debate , but this is one performance his critics wo n't forget .			2
