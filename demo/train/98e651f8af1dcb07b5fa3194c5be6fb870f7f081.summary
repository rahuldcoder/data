-- president @entity1 spared few from his zingers at saturday 's @entity4 -- including himself			1
he stepped to the podium as @entity7 's " @entity6 " played as an introduction and told the audience , " @entity10 warned you about this -- second term , baby			2
" his advisers were " a little worried about the new rap entrance music , " and suggested that he kick off his speech with jokes at his own expense to " take himself down a peg			0
" but , the president responded , " after 4Â½ years , how many pegs are there left ? " @entity1 went for it anyway , joking about his appearance -- " these days i look in the mirror and i got ta admit : i 'm not the strapping young @entity34 socialist that i used to be , " he said -- and his recent " rookie mistakes , " one of which being his remark about @entity30 attorney general @entity29			1
at a fundraiser for the @entity37 in @entity30 , @entity1 called @entity38 the country 's " best - looking attorney general			1
" " as you can imagine , i got in trouble when i got back home , " @entity1 said			1
" who knew ( attorney general ) @entity46 was so sensitive ? " then there was his pitiful basketball score at the @entity4 @entity49 , and the kerfuffle over @entity51 and @entity53 © 's trip to @entity54			1
" maybe i have lost a step , but some things are beyond my control , " he said			0
" for example , this whole controversy about @entity51 going to @entity54			1
i got 99 problems , and now @entity51 's one			1
" the second term can take its toll , he went on , quipping that he 's tried taking inspiration from his wife , @entity66 -- but bangs do n't really work on the commander - in - chief , as photos displayed on the screen proved			0
he 's also been advised to take a page from @entity73 ' performance in 1995 's " the @entity75 president			2
" @entity1 asked @entity73 , who was in the audience , " what 's your secret ? could it be that you were an actor in an @entity83 liberal fantasy ? might that have something to do with it ? i do n't know			1
" while he was airing out his frustrations , the president acknowledged the political bickering in @entity89			2
" it 's simple : we need to make progress on some important issues , " he said			0
" take the sequester : republicans fell in love with this thing			0
and now they ca n't stop talking about how much they hate it -- it 's like we 're trapped in a @entity104 album			2
" the press was also included in his standup routine			0
the @entity108 , whose depiction of @entity111 in its tv miniseries " @entity112 " left viewers claiming that it resembled the president , was n't in attendance , likely because of that incident , @entity1 said			1
" of course , that never kept @entity118 from showing up -- they actually thought the comparison was not fair to @entity111 , " he joked			0
to @entity0 , he said he admired the " commitment to cover all sides of the story , just in case one of them happens to be accurate , " while he commended the " nice change of pace " at @entity122			0
the network now has his former political adviser @entity129 working for them , whereas " @entity122 used to work for @entity129			0
" although he kept the audience laughing , the president made sure to address the tragedies that have happened over the past few weeks			1
" these have been some hard days for too many of our citizens , " he said , closing out his speech			0
" as we gather here tonight , our thoughts are not far from the people of @entity146 , the people of @entity139 , @entity140 , and the families in the @entity142 who are coping with some terrible floods			1
so we 've had some difficult days			0
" yet through the efforts of first and all those who helped those during their time of need , " even when the days seem darkest , we have seen humanity shine at its brightest			0
" as the invited guests arrived at saturday 's dinner , they were curious about the tone @entity1 would strike in light of the headlines			1
but with @entity161 ' late - night talk show host @entity162 tasked with leading the night 's ceremony , at least a little comedy was a certainty			1
the " @entity166 " comedian said when his role was announced in february that guests could expect " ( two ) minutes of jokes , then 40 minutes on public employee pension reform			0
" @entity162 first hosted the @entity4 in 1995			1
@entity1 , who attended the gala for the fifth time saturday , has also become a pro at landing some of the night 's biggest punchlines			1
the president quipped at last year 's dinner , which was hosted by @entity178 's @entity177 , that his hair had grayed so much since taking office he was just a few years out from looking like @entity181			2
the @entity183 gala , also known as the " nerd prom , " sees @entity186 's newsmakers stroll a red carpet that 's also filled with press and stars from across entertainment			1
attendees included fashion influencers like @entity194 editor - in - chief @entity193 , and sports stars like @entity197 champ @entity196 and @entity199 sophomore @entity198 , who suffered a horrific leg break during an @entity202 game last month			0
there were also enough famous faces to have the night mistaken for an awards ceremony			0
@entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 and @entity214 were all in attendance			0
with the president being a professed fan of @entity219 's " homeland , " perhaps it was n't surprising to see stars @entity220 and @entity222 there as well			2
some of the night 's best lines actually came from @entity225 , who participated in a comedic video billed as " secret footage " showing how the @entity228 comes together			1
@entity225 , as his " @entity230 " character , majority whip @entity229 , wheeled and dealed with both press and politicians			1
" @entity186 and @entity233 : some new faces , some old faces , and some new faces on old faces			1
and i do sympathize , @entity166 , and not just for that backstabbing @entity240 , but having to host			0
it must be so hard to write jokes about a town that already is one , " @entity225 said in the spoof			1
" @entity246 , republicans , the @entity4 , @entity89 -- you all came together to make this spoof			0
that 's what real bipartisanship looks like			0
i may lie , cheat and intimidate to get what i want , but at least i get the job done			0
so i hope some of you were taking notes			0
" @entity162 's routine was well - received , as he closed the night by riffing on the " nerd prom " theme , pointing out how much the event resembled a high school cafeteria			2
with so many stars there on shows that draw their drama from the @entity183 , @entity162 did an imaginary casting for a " major tv miniseries about the power players in @entity186			1
" vice president @entity269 would be played by @entity270 , while speaker of the house @entity271 would be played by " tan mom			2
" when @entity162 focused his humor on the president , he nailed him on his jobs strategy : " as you all know , the president is hard at work creating jobs			1
since he was first elected , the number of popes has doubled			0
the number of ' @entity285 ' hosts has tripled			0
" but the comedian also took a moment for reflection as he brought up the @entity289 , thanking the president " for visiting that great city and helping those people begin to heal			2
" the dinner , which raises money for journalism scholarships , was first established in 1920 with the intent to increase communication between the president and the press			2
it was a men - only event until 1962 , when president @entity302 said he would n't attend unless women were invited as well .			2
