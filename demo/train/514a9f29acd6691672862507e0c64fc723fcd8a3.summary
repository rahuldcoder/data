two days past 18 he was waiting for the bus in his @entity3 green ... those are the first two lines from one of the most powerful songs i have ever heard , " traveling soldier			2
" if you do n't know it , i encourage you to look it up -- unless you 're one of those folks who still hates the group that made the song popular , in which case , its beauty might be lost on you			0
it was 10 years ago this week -- as the country was barreling toward war with @entity21 -- that @entity22 , lead singer of the @entity23 , stood in front of a packed house in @entity26 and said : " just so you know , we 're on the good side with y'all			1
we do not want this war , this violence			2
and we 're ashamed the president of the @entity33 is from @entity34			0
" it did n't matter that the evidence to invade @entity21 was questionable or that @entity22 later apologized			1
the damage was done , and one of the most popular acts in the country became its most hated			0
its music was banned from radio , cds were trashed by bulldozers , and one band member 's home was vandalized			0
@entity22 introduced " soldier " with a call for peace , but she would soon find that the group needed metal detectors installed at entrances to shows on its stateside tour because of death threats			0
it was a classic case of freedom of speech meeting the irrational repercussions of that speech			0
" soldier " is not only their last no. 1 , it 's still their last single to chart in the top 30			0
officially , they 've been on hiatus since 2006 , but @entity22 , who is planning on releasing a solo cd in may , recently said , " i just do n't feel like it 's the @entity23 ' time			1
" for anyone who appreciates great music , this admission should be vexing			0
prior to @entity22 ' 2003 comments , the group 's previous two cds had sold at least 10 million copies each , and they were singing the @entity79 at the @entity80			1
in two years , they had won eight @entity82 , including the male - dominated @entity84 category in 2000			2
but they did n't reach that level of popularity because of sexy outfits and auto - tuned vocals			0
if anything , @entity91 and company should be viewed as prophets , not pariahs , considering that the weapons of mass destruction the @entity96 administration led the country to believe @entity100 was housing were never found			1
or that since 2006 , the majority of @entity33 have felt the invasion was a mistake to begin with			2
and yet , despite all that we now know , the @entity23 remain ostracized in the world they came from , as if they were the ones who presented false information to the @entity112 @entity111 ; as if they waged a war @entity114 's right - hand man now says " can not be justified " ; as if the misguided attack were their fault			1
before the group was set to do an interview with @entity119 in late april 2003 -- with hopes of stopping the public relations bleeding -- they questioned why they needed to grovel and beg for @entity96 's forgiveness			0
in a scene from the 2006 documentary " @entity23 : @entity127 , " their own pr rep explains , " he 's got sky - high approval			1
the war could n't be going better			2
by the time this interview airs ... the looting will be done ; the rebuilding of @entity21 will be started			1
... two weeks from now , it 's going to be even a more positive situation			0
" soon after , @entity96 delivered a victory speech on the deck of an aircraft carrier , underneath a banner that read " @entity141			0
" the war was n't declared over until eight years later			1
and somehow , folks remain mad at the @entity23			1
last week , in marking the 10 - year anniversary of @entity22 ' comments , @entity144 asked fans whether the @entity23 should be forgiven , and more than a third of responders said " no. " which probably explains why their next performances are in @entity152 .			1

@entity154 : 10 years ago , @entity23 ' comments on @entity156 drew *denunciations*
he says *history* *vindicated* them . many decry @entity21 war ; weapons of mass destruction not found
he says many still denounce them , as though they were *responsible* for war mistake
