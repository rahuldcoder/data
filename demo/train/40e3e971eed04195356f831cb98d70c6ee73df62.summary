-- months after rescuers found them struggling and covered in oil , 33 endangered and threatened young sea turtles are finally going home to the @entity5			1
scientists from the @entity9 , the @entity6 and the @entity7 freed the turtles thursday in waters about 40 miles southwest of @entity12 , @entity13			1
this marked the latest mass release of turtles since about 500 were rescued in the weeks and months after the massive months - long oil spill			1
" we were able to release these turtles because they 're now healthy , and we 're seeing recovery in the surface habitats of the @entity5 , " @entity9 administrator @entity18 said in a news release			1
the spill began after an april 20 explosion on the offshore drilling platform @entity27 that killed 11 men			2
two days later , the platform sank and oil started gushing into the @entity5			1
in early august , owner @entity31 used cement and mud to plug the damaged @entity5 well			2
officials formally declared an end to the oil spill disaster on september 19 , though considerable efforts remained to clean up area waters and revive wildlife affected by the spill			1
earlier this month , @entity9 reopened federal waters off the @entity13 coast to fishing			0
thursday 's release marked another milestone in the area 's recovery , according to those involved			0
" returning this group of sea turtles to their home waters is ... a sign that @entity13 is on the path towards recovery , " said @entity50 , an assistant secretary for @entity13 's office of fisheries			2
the 33 turtles had been rescued more than three months ago by federal officials and state wildlife authorities from @entity13 , @entity62 and @entity63 , as well as the @entity64 and the @entity65			1
they were rehabilitated at the @entity7 in @entity67			0
they included green , @entity70 's ridley and hawksbill sea turtles , which are classified as endangered species			0
there also were loggerheads , which are a threatened species			0
with 270 turtles having been cleaned , nursed back to health and released , there are more than 200 still in rehabilitation sites around the area			0
scientists did extensive aerial and shipboard tests earlier this week on the waters near the release point , making sure the sargassum algae was clean			2
young turtles thrive in such areas , which provide protection from predators and ample food , including small crabs , snails and other creatures			0
" six months ago , it was nearly impossible to imagine this day would ever come , " said @entity94 , the @entity7 's ceo and president .			0

the turtles were among 500 rescued after the *mammoth* months - long oil spill
they are now healthy , and the habitat is recovering , scientist say
*experts* say the release is further *evidence* that the @entity5 waters are recovering
