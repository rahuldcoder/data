-- during the @entity2 in @entity3 , which will end with sunday 's closing ceremony , there have been many memorable moments : the triumph of @entity7			1
the dazzling talent of @entity9			2
the countless displays of lustrous skills honed by the world 's finest young athletes over years of arduous practice			1
but one of the most lasting memories may be the one provided by an 86 - year - old woman who was not exactly an obscure footnote to history when the @entity2 began			1
@entity22 , in her now - famous @entity21 scene , was a highlight , if not the highlight , of the opening ceremony			1
her deadpan grace was something that many an accomplished actor would envy			2
with four words , delivered to an enormous global audience , she , with an implied smiling wink , humanized herself and embodied winning warmth			0
the filmed scene will always be a hallmark of the @entity35 ( the stunt double jumping out of the helicopter -- who would have imagined that she would have approved it ? )			0
these vastly entertaining television olympics really began with those four words from her : " good evening , mr. @entity21			1
" as the queen turned from her writing desk to greet @entity21 , played by the current @entity21 actor @entity46 , her calm tone of voice reminded me of the lovely scene in the movie " @entity53 , " in which @entity54 , playing @entity22 , says to @entity56 , the actor playing @entity57 : " yes , well , you are my 10th prime minister , mr. @entity57			1
my first , of course , was @entity60			0
" @entity35 legacy : trust the @entity62 to get it right in greeting @entity46 in the @entity35 scene , the real queen , in that utterly polite but manifestly unimpressed voice , could just as well have been saying : " yes , well , you are my seventh @entity21 , mr. @entity46			1
my first , of course , was @entity69			0
" ( for those of you who are already thinking that there have been only six feature - film bonds -- @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity46 -- you are leaving out @entity78 , who played @entity21 in a less - than - officially - authorized " @entity79 " in 1967			1
and there have been other @entity81 in various radio and television productions			0
) @entity22 has been around for them all			2
in fact , she was already wearing the crown when , in 1953 , @entity87 published his first @entity21 novel , " @entity79			2
" the films that were inspired by @entity87 's books have been a strong , hugely popular and endlessly lucrative franchise , but there is a case to be made that the novels are even better			2
just reading the opening words of " @entity79 " is a lesson in beautiful scene - setting , the flawless introduction of a brand - new character : " the scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating at three in the morning			0
then the soul - erosion produced by high gambling -- a compost of greed and fear and nervous tension -- becomes unbearable and the senses awake and revolt from it			0
" @entity21 suddenly knew that he was tired			2
he always knew when his body or his mind had had enough and he always acted on that knowledge			0
this helped him to avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes			0
... " opinion : @entity35 have redefined how @entity62 sees itself the novels still read thrillingly today ( here 's a tip : the best of them is " @entity125 " ) , but there is no question that when the movies came along , they overshadowed @entity87 's ink - on - paper volumes			2
this @entity131 year commemorating @entity22 's 60 - year reign is also the 50th anniversary of the @entity21 films , starting with " @entity135 , " and the series is receiving renewed attention			1
in the 1980s i spent a day with @entity73 -- he was filming " @entity141 " with @entity139 and @entity140 -- as he left the set to go to several appointments with doctors			0
it turned out that for all his daring exploits in the @entity21 movies , he was deathly afraid of needles ( as a child he had seen from eye - level and inches away a girl from his class in @entity154 getting inoculated during a diphtheria outbreak , and " the fear of needles has been with me ever since			2
" ) of @entity87 's @entity21 novels , @entity69 said : " to tell you the truth , i never read them all			1
" of the ones he did read , he said , " i was never all that crazy about the books			0
" but the author himself ? " i liked @entity87 , " @entity69 said			0
" he was erudite -- and a real snob			0
being a genuine snob can be quite healthy			0
at least you know who you 're dealing with			0
" we got along rather well , surprisingly			0
we had both been in the @entity172 -- although he was a commander and i was an able - bodied seaman			0
" by the time @entity46 was born in 1968 , @entity73 had already starred in five @entity21 films			1
@entity69 told me that he approved of the idea of new generations of actors playing @entity21 as the years went by -- " the guy should be young			1
or at least under 50 " -- and so it was @entity46 , as the @entity181 , who co-starred with the queen in the @entity35 film			1
to look at @entity46 's face after the queen turns and sees him -- " good evening , mr. @entity181 " -- is to see @entity46 the man , not just @entity46 the actor			1
he knows just how indelible a moment this is in his own life			0
he 's doing a scene with @entity22 -- and she is the reveal , not him			1
in the @entity21 movies , it 's the @entity21 character who , sometimes literally , always symbolically , makes the turn , and reveals to the audience who he is : " @entity21			1
" but in the @entity35 film , the queen , as @entity46 clearly and delightedly understands , is the actor the audience 's eyes are fastened upon			1
not bad , at 86			0
and , as enduring @entity2 moments go , gold			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : one of the most memorable @entity2 moments was *n't* in a sporting event
he says the video of @entity22 and @entity21 actor @entity46 was striking
this year *celebrates* the queen 's 60th anniversary on the throne and @entity21 's 50 years in films
