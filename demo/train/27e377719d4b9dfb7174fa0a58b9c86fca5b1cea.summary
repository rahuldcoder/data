-- who is # @entity2 ? @entity2 , @entity2 for short , is a @entity3 soccer star			1
he sent @entity4 into meltdown on monday when he joined @entity6 on a one - year loan from @entity8 , swapping the @entity9 for a considerably higher tax bill and a city where it rains 53 % of the year			1
aged 28 , he scores goals			0
during spells with @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity8 , he 's earned a reputation as one of @entity21 's finest strikers			1
monday was @entity24 football 's " transfer deadline day , " the last opportunity for the continent 's top teams to sign new players			2
imagine @entity29 draft day , only with no structure and more chaos			0
good news for @entity6 , then ? yes and no. @entity2 is good enough to improve any team , but @entity6 hardly needed another attacking player			1
last week it paid @entity37 nearly $ 100m to sign @entity38 , a forward - thinking addition to a squad that already included the likes of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			2
throw @entity2 into the mix and @entity6 manager @entity46 is spoiled for choice at the front of his line - up , but it 's at the rear where his team is exposed			1
@entity6 is yet to win this season and recently suffered a humiliating 4 - 0 defeat to third division team @entity55 in the @entity56			1
simply put , @entity6 signing @entity2 is like buying a really nice sweater but forgetting to put on your trousers			1
wait , you said @entity3			0
where was he at the @entity63 ? the man nicknamed " @entity2 " ( @entity65 ) missed @entity3 's run to the quarterfinals of @entity68 2014 with a knee injury he picked up in january			1
the whole country was praying their star striker would be fit for selection , so much so that @entity3 president @entity74 even visited @entity2 in hospital , but sadly it was n't to be			2
in his absence , @entity78 ( pronounced " ham - ez " ) @entity76 scored six goals as @entity3 swaggered its way into the last eight before defeat to hosts @entity68			0
a new star was born , and @entity76 is now strutting his stuff at @entity37 having also left @entity8			2
did @entity2 not fancy joining " ham - ez " in @entity17 ? funny you should mention that			1
on saturday a @entity4 sent from @entity2 's official account said ( a rough translation ) " @entity92 , a dream come true			1
" but @entity2 swiftly denied sending the tweet , saying his profile had been compromised			2
@entity97 hackers ... who is the middle man in the transfer ? uber agent @entity101 , who is seemingly doing his utmost to keep the @entity104 economy afloat			0
as well as @entity2 and @entity76 , @entity101 brokered the deal to bring @entity106 to @entity107 and @entity108 to @entity109			2
where can i find his @entity4 account ? @ @entity2 is his official @entity4 handle			0
he 's also on @entity113 and if you head over there you 'll find proof he 's also pretty handy with a baseball bat			0
he 's a big guy ... yep , with hair like @entity120			0
but he 's spoken for			0
his wife is @entity123 singer / songwriter @entity122			0
his dad @entity124 was also a professional footballer , playing in @entity3 , and he thinks his son is going all the way to the top			0
" @entity2 will lead @entity8 to the @entity130 , " said @entity2 's entirely impartial father when his son first signed for the @entity9 team in 2013			1
" every team he plays for he makes better and he wins a title			0
" his dad was right			0
@entity8 did qualify for the @entity130 , even if @entity2 missed most of last season through injury			1
now @entity2 junior has a similar mission to help @entity6 qualify for @entity21 's top competition			1
the @entity140 club is n't in @entity21 after an awful season under @entity143 's successor @entity142 , who was subsequently sacked .			0

@entity2 joins @entity6 on a one - year loan from @entity8
@entity2 will be counted on to help *kickstart* @entity6 's season
but some will be *surprised* that @entity6 did not sign a central *defender*
@entity6 has *amassed* two points from its opening three league *games*
