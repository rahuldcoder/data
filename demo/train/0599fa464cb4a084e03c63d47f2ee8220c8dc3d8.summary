and that 's what fellow conservatives had to say sunday about @entity6 gov. @entity5 and her decision to step down with 18 months left in her term			1
@entity6 gov. @entity5 announced friday that she will step down this month			1
@entity9 left it to @entity12 and conservative voices to assess what friday 's unexpected announcement by @entity5 means for her and a possible run for the 2012 @entity12 presidential nomination			1
for example , vice president @entity17 called it a personal decision , offering no analysis of why she did it			0
by contrast , those on the political right acknowledged that they did n't know what to make of it			0
@entity30 , the " architect " of @entity32 's successful presidential campaigns , said the resignation left many of @entity5 's fellow republicans " a little perplexed			1
" " it 's a risky strategy , " @entity30 told " @entity37			0
" " @entity43 , " was the pronouncement by @entity39 sen. @entity39 of @entity40 , and conservative columnist @entity41 said @entity5 was declaring herself a quitter			1
@entity5 , who was sen. @entity44 's vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election , said she already knew she would not seek a second term and decided against being a lame duck governor for the next 18 months			1
she also complained that too much time and too many taxpayer dollars were going toward fighting ethics investigations and that the mainstream media were continuing with unfair attacks on her and her family			0
some analysts believe that @entity5 will seek the 2012 @entity12 presidential nomination and that her resignation is intended to free her to prepare			1
@entity30 , whom @entity32 dubbed " the architect " for managing his successful presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2004 , said stepping down now wo n't lessen the media spotlight on @entity5			1
in fact , he said , leaving the governor 's office takes away her platform for controlling her agenda and message			0
" the media , if she wants to run for president , is going to be following her for the next 3½ years , " said @entity30 , who called the move unclear and therefore a potentially harmful strategy for a politician			2
" effective strategies in politics are ones that are so clear and obvious that people can grasp			0
... it 's not clear what she 's doing and why			0
" ireport.com : share thoughts on @entity5 stepping down @entity39 told the @entity82 program " @entity84 " that he had " no insight into why she did it			2
" " i would think , if you want to run for president -- and i 'm not sure that 's got anything to do with what she 's doing -- that the forum of a governorship would be a better forum than just being a private citizen , " the veteran senator said			2
@entity41 told the @entity96 program " @entity99 " that he had " no idea why she did this			2
" " the one that rings most hollow is , she does n't want to put @entity6 through the terror of [ her ] being a lame - duck governor , " @entity41 said			1
" if she is just weary of it , one can understand that			0
still , she made a contract with [ voters ] to serve out her term			0
and she said , in her own words , she now is a quitter			0
" @entity12 sen. @entity111 of @entity6 criticized @entity5 's decision as abandoning the state 's voters			1
@entity5 defeated @entity111 's father the gubernatorial election in 2006			1
but @entity6 lt. gov. @entity117 , also on the @entity37 program , said sunday that @entity111 's statement disappointed him because it failed to recognize all that @entity5 has accomplished in her 2½ years in office			1
" she does n't need a title to effect change and bring some hope to people who need it , " said @entity117 , a @entity12 who stands to become governor when @entity5 steps down this month			1
ireport.com : conservative says @entity5 decision " not a smart move " @entity5 had no public appearances sunday , but she encouraged her followers via @entity135 to ignore the pundits			1
" critics are spinning , so hang in there as they feed false info on the right decision made as i enter last yr in office to not run again , " her @entity135 message said			2
in an @entity145 message to supporters , @entity5 said she was leaving office for a " higher calling			2
" " how sad that @entity151 and the media will never understand ; it 's about country , " @entity5 said in a statement attributed to her on her @entity150 page			1
" and though it 's honorable for countless others to leave their positions for a higher calling and without finishing a term , of course we know by now , for some reason a different standard applies for the decisions i make			0
but every @entity164 understands what it takes to make a decision because it 's right for all , including your family			0
" @entity5 said her administration had " accomplished more during this one term than most governors do in two			1
" " we have accomplished so much , and there 's much more to do , but my family and i determined after prayerful consideration that sacrificing my title helps @entity6 most , " she said			2
" and once i decided not to run for re-election , my decision was that much easier			2
i 've never been one to waste time or resources			0
" ireport.com : " no solid explanation " from @entity5 former @entity184 gov. @entity183 , who ran unsuccessfully for the @entity12 presidential nomination in 2008 , noted that @entity5 will remain in the media spotlight regardless of whether she is governor			1
" the challenge that she 's going to have is that there will be people who will say , ' look , if they chased you out of this , it wo n't get any easier at other levels , ' " @entity183 said			0
" it could be a brilliant strategy			0
the point is , we do n't know			0
" @entity183 called a presidential campaign " brutal " and said a @entity12 primary will ratchet up the pressure on @entity5			2
" when your opponents within your own team spend millions of dollars to redefine you , it 's very , very difficult , " @entity183 said			0
