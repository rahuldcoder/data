-- last june , @entity1 stunned fans when he revealed in a press release that he was suffering from alzheimer 's disease			1
it was not an easy decision to go public with his private struggle , but his family felt it was a decision that needed to be made			1
" the main thing we were concerned about was during shows he would forget a line or get a little confused , " says @entity1 's daughter , @entity10			1
" people would think , ' is he drunk ? ' is he doing drugs again ? ' so we did n't want people to get the wrong impression			1
" but an interesting thing happened after the @entity22 's announcement			2
instead of fading off into the sunset like a forgotten icon , the 75 - year - old entertainer has been catapulted back into the spotlight -- and the music industry ca n't seem to shower him with enough accolades			2
in november , he was the subject of a star - studded tribute at the @entity32 show , and on sunday night , he 'll pick up a @entity33 at the @entity34			1
behind the scenes , it 's been somewhat of a standoff between the @entity32 and the @entity38 , with each telecast vying for bragging rights to have @entity1 perform			1
but there 's nothing like the pull of the @entity38 -- especially when you 're a five - time @entity38 winner			1
at the @entity32 , @entity1 beamed from the audience while @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 serenaded him with his biggest hits , but the @entity38 will be a different story			1
@entity1 himself will take center stage for " rhinestone cowboy , " flanked by @entity55 , @entity56 and his own band -- which features three of his grown children			1
it 'll be his first live television performance since the @entity22 's diagnosis , and thus , it will also be a bit of a cliffhanger			1
last fall , @entity1 released his final album , " @entity64 , " then hit the road on what he 's calling his farewell tour			1
most of the time , he sails through his set like the charismatic veteran he is			2
three teleprompters at the foot of the stage enable him to read his lyrics , and when he flubs a line here or there , he usually laughs it off			2
but there are rare moments when he 'll become a little disoriented , and that 's when it helps that he 's surrounded by family on stage			2
@entity84 keeps things steady on drums , while his brother , @entity87 , plays guitar nearby			2
their younger sister , @entity10 , stands protectively to @entity1 's left , on keyboards , banjo and violin			1
" he looks at me sometimes if he is confused , and i just smile at him			2
i just try to make him feel like he is surrounded by people that love him on stage , " says @entity10			2
while most people with @entity22 's drift in and out of lucidity without fanfare , you know exactly when @entity1 has hit a rough patch			1
he 'll be playing a song on guitar that he 's played a gazillion times , like " @entity107 , " then all of a sudden hit a bad chord or forget the lyrics			2
it 's like a light switch			2
in concert , fans are happy to fill in the gaps when he has a senior moment , singing his lyrics back at him until he finds his way again			2
@entity1 's wife , @entity119 , watches serenely from the soundboard , knowing full - well that these incidents will occur from time to time			1
but the whole family has made peace with it , including @entity1			1
he tells @entity0 , " i am content with it			1
do n't cry over spilt milk			2
get up and be a man and do what you have got to do			2
" @entity0 recently sat down with @entity129 and @entity119 at their home in @entity131 , in a room overlooking the @entity134 coast			1
several guitars were on display within arm 's reach			2
others laid in cases in the entryway , ready to head out on the road			2
in another room , platinum and gold records lined the walls , documenting the success of " @entity107 , " " @entity149 " and " rhinestone cowboy			2
" clearly , music has been good to @entity1 , and @entity1 has been good for music			1
now , music is helping him cope with life			1
@entity0 : how does it feel to be receiving a @entity156 at the @entity38 ? @entity1 : i am flattered			1
all i wanted to do every since i could remember was play my guitar and sing			2
@entity0 : you came out to @entity160 in 1958 to be a guitarist			1
did you ever see yourself becoming a big star ? @entity1 : i never really thought of it ! i 'm a musician first			1
so when i got the job playing guitar with the session players , i said , " yay , i can play			2
" i was a little scared			2
i was a little nervous , but when i got in with @entity167 , i realized that i could cut it out here , and could do it			0
i played with the @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , the @entity174 , the @entity175			0
@entity0 : you 're known as a great guitar player , but did you ever take a formal lesson ? @entity1 : no. i can read a chord chart , but i could n't read a note chart			1
@entity0 : are you nervous about taking the stage these days ? @entity1 : i realize you are going to make mistakes through life			1
just do n't make any bad ones , you know			0
like all of my records are perfect records , but i did make mistakes on them			0
i would rather do live than any kind of lip - synching or something like that			0
i do n't like to lip - synch			0
@entity0 : what has been the reaction from fans ? @entity198 : boy , were we pleasantly surprised			1
they have been more than understanding			0
they have really just been rooting him on			0
glen : i do n't see myself any different , though			0
@entity119 : i actually think he is better than he was a year ago			1
i think that being out and performing all the time has something to do with it			0
music seems to be really good therapy for him			0
i do n't know if it is the vibrations			0
maybe they stimulate the brain			0
of course he is on some medications today that i think have been helping , too			0
so we are blessed to be living in a time when there are some treatments			0
there is no cure , but there are things that can help , and they are helping			0
glen : what did they diagnose me as ? @entity119 : @entity22 's			1
what is @entity22 's ? @entity119 : you start losing your memory and your ability to reason			1
glen : i just take it as it comes , you know			0
i know that i have a problem with that , but it does n't bother me			0
if you 're going to have it handed to you , you have got to take it , anyway			0
so that is the way i look at it			0
@entity0 : you went down to @entity245 for the @entity32 in november			1
seemed like you knew a lot of people there			0
glen : what is his name -- the one who married that long - legged girl ? @entity119 : @entity47			1
glen : yeah , @entity47			0
he is probably the best guitar player in @entity245			0
they are two of his favorites			0
glen : just incredible players			0
@entity0 : the two of you have been married nearly 30 years			1
did you really meet on a blind date ? @entity119 : i was dancing with the @entity261 at @entity262			1
glen : they had a bunch lined up and i thought , " i 'll take that one there			0
" no , i 'm kidding			0
@entity0 : was it love at first sight ? @entity119 , at that time , he was kind of a hell - raiser			1
@entity119 : i really did n't know anything about that , because i was a dancer , and i just had my head into @entity274 and i did n't read the tabloids			1
but i knew he was a singer			1
and then i went to one of his concerts -- " oh my goodness , i remember that song			0
" he had a lot of hits			0
so then i got a little more intimidated , but i really just did n't know much about him			0
@entity0 : @entity129 , did @entity119 change your life ? glen : yes , she did change my life in many ways			1
before i met her , i did n't know where i was at , or where i was going			0
and after i met her , i knew where i was going , and i knew where to wanted to go			0
do everything according to @entity294 , and be nice , and treat other people the way you would like to be treated			0
we both go on that bit of advice there			0
@entity0 : you 've had your ups and downs			1
glen : i was forgiven for being a dummy , literally			0
i have been through so many changes			0
the first part of my career , everything was not in place			0
@entity0 : do you pray every morning ? glen : sometimes i do , sometimes i do n't			1
@entity0 : what do you ask for ? glen : mainly thanks			1
thank you , @entity315 , for letting me get up this morning			0
let me have a good day			0
and if you do n't , i will come up there and get you ! and he laughs at that .			0
