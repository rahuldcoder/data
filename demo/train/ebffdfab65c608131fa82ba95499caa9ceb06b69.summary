-- it 's the staple of almost every kung fu action film ever made : the hero is targeted for revenge after teaching the deadly and closely guarded secrets of the martial art to outsiders and , even worse , foreigners			1
but ask @entity10 -- the 73 - year - old practitioner of the 300 - year - old kung fu style known as @entity13 -- and he will tell you that making the martial art accessible to foreigners is the only way to save it from extinction			1
the son of a student to @entity23 , one of the legends of the fighting style and the subject of countless films , @entity20 ( sifu is a @entity29 term that means ' master ' ) says the fighting art may be growing fast overseas , but struggles in the region where it was born			1
to counter the decline , he has co-authored the world 's first @entity36 - language manual on the ancient kung fu style that he has taught for 60 years and has been his family 's trademark for more than three generations			1
called @entity43 : @entity44 , the manual outlines scores of moves and stances that were hitherto only taught and transmitted orally			2
while there are dozens of fighting styles in kung fu ( the northern styles represented by fast , high kicks and rapid , fluid movements ) , @entity13 is a southern @entity56 fighting art characterised by strong stances and fast footwork			1
one practitioner famously destroyed the bamboo planks in a demonstration platform simply by shifting his feet in the ' hard stances ' of @entity13			2
@entity20 , meanwhile , teaches a steady stream of foreigners the ancient fighting art in the cramped living room of his tiny apartment on the 7th floor of a tenement block in @entity72 's @entity71			0
in terms of @entity72 kung fu , it 's about as traditional as it gets , right down to the name ' @entity78 ' which translates as ' @entity79 ' ; a name unchanged from the days when kung fu masters , so used to treating the training accidents of their students , were the first stop for neighborhood trauma injuries and broken bones			1
using a spear against his sword - wielding son @entity89 , @entity20 is a blur of threshing weapons amid the armchairs , ornaments and computer printers in his urban home			0
" training in a small area like this is very good for control , " he says in a space so cramped it looks like two men having a knife fight in a telephone booth			0
for his long - standing foreign students -- @entity13 teachers from @entity106 , the @entity107 and @entity108 -- the turn of fighting speed still draws a gasp of admiration			1
" many students in @entity106 like traditional kung fu and especially this style which is the origin of the martial art , " said @entity113 , who runs an academy in @entity115 but perfects the art in @entity20 's living room on trips to @entity72			1
@entity123 , who teaches @entity13 in @entity124 , @entity107 , says his students are drawn as much by the eastern philosophy associated with the martial art as they are by learning a fighting style			1
" it 's very popular in the @entity107 -- people there are really looking for something more than fighting arts			0
they want to train their bodies and their minds -- this style is really very good for that , " he said			0
while there may be more dedicated practitioners overseas than in @entity72 , @entity20 's co-author @entity139 , who also studies the @entity13 style , said that the form remains a potent cultural symbol in @entity72			1
" it 's rooted in a very specific @entity72 identity as well , " @entity139 said			0
both he and @entity20 believe the style is so important as a cultural symbol , the government should recognize it as part of @entity72 's intangible cultural heritage			0
@entity139 , who has studied the interaction between the media , entertainment and the martial arts , says that @entity157 sometimes gives a lopsided view of @entity56 martial arts , focusing on various personalities such as @entity161 , @entity162 's famous teacher , to the exclusion of all other equally famous teachers and styles			2
despite this , he says its popularization in film sometimes unconsciously transmits positive aspects of kung fu culture			2
" besides the fighting , one of the reasons that @entity162 has been such a global celebrity until to today is because a lot of messages strike a chord and resonate among the marginalized , " @entity139 says			0
" why would , for instance , a @entity179 community in the @entity180 look on @entity162 as a hero ? because embedded in these films are messages of righteousness			0
of someone who is disadvantaged but through dedication to kung fu can become empowered and through his own empowerment help the rest of the community			2
" this is very positive and i would say the @entity162 path represents one of the best interactions between film and martial arts -- it 's something we do n't often see these days			0
" while foreigners may be beating a path to the kung fu clinic 's door , local interest in @entity72 is only just gaining ground after a long hiatus			2
@entity20 says modern distractions like videogames are sapping young people of the ability to focus on demanding martial art forms like @entity13 which can require learning as many as 300 movements in a single set			1
" these days pupils ca n't stand any hardship			0
they say practicing is tiring and they give up easily , " he says .			0

masters of a southern @entity56 style of kung fu have published the first manual in @entity36
the style known as @entity13 *emphasises* strong foundation stances and footwork
@entity10 is a direct *descendant* of kung fu legend @entity23
he says the manual will help save the martial art - which has more foreign practitioners - from extinction
