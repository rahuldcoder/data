-- on a stormy january night in 1992 , out in the @entity4 , 29,000 plastic yellow ducks , blue turtles and green frogs fell from a cargo ship and were lost at sea			1
for the past 21 years , these durable plastic bath toys have been floating around the world , passing the site where the @entity10 sank , landing in @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 and even spending years frozen in an @entity15 ice pack			1
originally sealed in a 40 - foot steel shipping container , rough seas and huge waves knocked the bath toys overboard , along with several other containers that sank straight to the ocean floor			1

the @entity27 , whose members represent 90 % of the world 's container ship capacity , say that figure is grossly exaggerated and estimate that on average no more than 350 containers are lost annually			1
due to severe weather and high seas , accidents or incorrect stowage , there are now shipping containers littering the seabed all around the world			2
many float on the surface for months , some rupture and release their goods , but most eventually sink to the bottom -- creating deep - sea stepping stones between ports across the globe			0
oceanographer and self - confessed beachcomber @entity52 says , " usually container ships lose containers when the ship starts rolling side - to - side at more than a 55 - degree - angle			1
you have to imagine a couple of dozen containers falling overboard together			2
when they start banging together , it 's a very , very violent episode			0
" approximately 90 % of worldwide cargo travels by sea -- an overwhelming percentage			2
while often overlooked , shipping containers have transformed global trade , easily moving between truck , train and ship			1

according to @entity89 , @entity90 and senior associate at international law firm @entity92 , " there is no international convention which places an obligation on shipping companies to report losses of containers at sea			2
" however , a report will likely be required if the loss of the container is considered to be a marine accident , presents a danger to navigation , or if discharge of the contents of the container is such that it breaches the @entity102			0
in june of this year , a five - year - old container ship , the @entity103 broke its back in heavy weather and split apart off the coast of @entity108			1
there were no casualties but all 7,000 containers , reportedly carrying consumer electronics and clothes , were lost after the ship caught fire and subsequently sank -- a catastrophic event that cost insurers between $ 300 - 400 million in claims			2
over the years , a great wealth of unusual items has washed up on beaches around the world			0
in 2006 , beachcombers scavenging the @entity124 of @entity125 were greeted by thousands of sealed bags of @entity128 tortilla chips that floated onto the beach , dry and still in an edible condition			0
during a storm in 1990 , a large wave washed 21 shipping containers into the @entity4			1
60,000 @entity136 shoes -- en route from @entity138 to the @entity139 -- splashed into the waves			0
over the next year , hundreds of shoes -- from hiking boots to children 's shoes -- were discovered on the beaches of the @entity146 , western @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149			0

for the last 21 years , @entity52 has been tracking the ducks , frogs and turtles from @entity162 , where they first landed , all the way to @entity165 and @entity166			2
having patiently recorded the date and location of each sighting , he has been able to learn an enormous amount about the ocean 's conveyor belt			0
while @entity52 says only 3 % of findings are reported , the last sighting he is aware of was a frog in august of this year			0
today , he believes there are only a few hundred left ... still at the mercy of the winds and surface currents			0
once the tale of the tub toys is over , @entity52 says he still has plenty of other container spills to help him track the currents -- 34,000 hockey gloves and 5 million @entity187 pieces were dropped in the ocean 16 years ago , for example			1
" it 's a strange thing to be living on a planet and not know what 's in 70 % of it , " @entity52 says			0
" you literally never know what 's going to wash up onto shore			0

a container of plastic ducks , frogs and *beavers* broke free from a cargo ship and fell into the @entity4 in 1992
the durable bath toys have been floating around ever since *providing* *insights* into the flow of ocean currents
some estimates suggest as many as 10,000 containers fall into the ocean every year
