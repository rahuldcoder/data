@entity0 is in a bind over binders			2
the @entity4 presidential nominee is being challenged about the details of hiring women for top government positions when he won election as governor of @entity11 in 2002 , giving a possible late boost to efforts by president @entity15 's campaign to strengthen its support among female voters			1
less than three weeks before @entity21 , the battle for the women 's vote -- a demographic @entity15 won easily in 2008 and needs again this year to secure re-election -- appeared to be tightening			1
then comments by @entity0 in tuesday 's second of three presidential debates raised questions about what actually happened when he was governor and provided an opening for @entity15 's team to challenge whether he understands the role of women in the workplace and the economy			1
did @entity0 lose ground with women ? " i had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men , " @entity0 said at the debate in answer to a question about equal pay for women			1
" and i went to my staff , and i said , ' how come all the people for these jobs are all men ? ' they said , ' well , these are the people that have the qualifications			0
' and i said , ' well , gosh , ca n't we find some women that are also qualified ? ' " that led to a " concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members " of his cabinet , he continued , saying : " i went to a number of women 's groups and said , ' can you help us find folks ? ' and they brought us whole binders full of women			0
" @entity0 added that a university study later concluded that @entity11 under his leadership " had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in @entity73			1
" the " binders full of women " reference prompted a huge response on social media , becoming the third - fastest rising @entity81 search during the debate and getting a @entity84 hashtag , a series of memes on @entity87 and a @entity89 page with more than 8,000 members by thursday morning			0
with the attention came attempts by @entity15 and other @entity93 to gain political advantage			0
" we do n't have to order up some binders to find qualified , talented , driven young women who can learn and excel , " @entity15 told a campaign event thursday in @entity96			2
he quickly pivoted to the first bill he signed into law -- the @entity102 -- by saying he wanted new women graduates " to receive equal pay for equal work			1
" on wednesday , vice president @entity106 characterized @entity0 's perspective on women as a " 1950s time warp " in keeping with the @entity15 campaign 's efforts to focus the debate on women 's issues to topics involving personal choice , such as abortion and contraceptives , as well as equal opportunity			1
at a campaign stop on thursday in @entity121 , @entity106 repeated his warning that a @entity0 presidency was certain to bring more conservative @entity125 justices who would overturn the @entity128 ruling that legalized abortion			0
a @entity132 / @entity131 poll of registered voters in 12 swing states found that more women considered abortion the most important election issue over jobs and the economy			2
@entity0 's team frames its pitch to women voters as an economic choice , arguing that high unemployment and sluggish growth under @entity15 particularly hurt women and families			1
" this president has failed @entity73 's women , " @entity0 told a campaign event wednesday in @entity149			1
" as i go across the country and ask women what can i do to help , what they speak about day in and day out is help me find a good job , or a good job for my spouse			0
and help my kid , make sure my children have a bright future , better schools and better job opportunities			0
that 's what the women of @entity73 are concerned about and the answers are coming from us and not from @entity15			2
" asked thursday about boosting jobs for women , @entity0 's running mate -- conservative @entity170 chairman @entity169 of @entity171 -- launched a lengthy response with a succinct summation : " get the economy growing			1
" @entity15 " took his eye off the ball of growing the economy , and as a result , the poverty rate among women is at a 17 - year high , " @entity169 told a campaign event in @entity178			0
" over 5 million women have just left the work force			0
fewer women are working today than when he took office			0
and so of the people who have been hit the hardest , it 's women			0
" @entity193 says no to another run meanwhile , disputes arose about @entity0 's account of what he did in @entity11			1
@entity198 , a @entity93 local official in @entity199 , @entity11 , who was executive director of the @entity201 from 2004 to 2008 , took exception to @entity0 's statement that he initiated the search for qualified women for his cabinet			1
a program her group oversaw provided @entity0 's transition team in 2002 with resumes of qualified women , @entity198 told a conference call with reporters wednesday			1
" @entity0 did not request those , " @entity198 said , explaining that the program called @entity216 approached @entity0 and his @entity93 opponent before the election to get their commitment for hiring women to state positions in proportion to the female population			1
" then after the election , our group approached the @entity0 transition team with the resumes , or the so - called binders full of women			2
" she also cited a study that showed @entity0 initially hired 14 women among 33 appointments to his cabinet -- 42 % of the total -- but by the end of his four - year term , the number of women in his administration was 25 % , lower than the previous or subsequent governors			0
" at the time @entity0 paid lip service to the public about hiring more women in senior positions , and treated it like a quota , " @entity198 said			2
" but like with so many other things that are @entity0 , the facts did not match the rhetoric			0
" @entity198 and @entity253 , the woman for whom the equal pay legislation was named , told reporters that @entity169 voted against the measure and @entity0 also opposes it			1
@entity0 has yet to clearly state his position on the law that strengthens the ability of women to sue employers over unequal pay			2
@entity263 , a staff writer for the @entity264 in @entity265 , told @entity266 on wednesday that @entity0 also had issues involving judicial appointees , noting 17 of the first 19 judges he appointed were men			0
" after some unfavorable press about that , he began appointing more women , " @entity263 said			0
by comparison , the @entity15 @entity274 had women holding just under 40 % of jobs paying $ 75,000 or more in 2011			0
@entity15 also chose women for his two @entity125 justice appointments -- @entity280 and @entity281 -- and made the fair pay act named for @entity253 his administration 's first new law			1
@entity253 said the law bearing her name " has caused a lot of employers , a lot of large employers , to look at their procedures and their process , and to look at all employees and their staffers to see if everybody 's being treated equitably and fairly			0
" @entity4 surrogates for @entity0 sought to play down the magnitude of the flap over his debate comments			2
@entity149 gov. @entity301 told @entity266 on thursday that the " binders full of women " response was good for " a laugh or two , " but was n't the main issue of what he called " a serious campaign			0
" " despite all the rhetoric and all the attempts of the @entity15 administration to separate men from women over social issues -- largely contrived , i think -- what men and women care about in this election is the economy , getting us back to work and getting us out of debt , " @entity301 said			2
" @entity0 's point was that he actually affirmatively went out to make sure that he had great , competent , qualified women in his cabinet			1
" citing a @entity131 poll that showed @entity0 catching up with @entity15 among women voters in an aberration from other polling so far , @entity301 said : " i 'm glad the @entity15 administration is having fun with it , but the point is that this race is now clearly going in the way of @entity0 because he 's a serious candidate			1
