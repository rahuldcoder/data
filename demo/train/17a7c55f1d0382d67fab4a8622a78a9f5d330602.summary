" we believe technology will actually change the economics of this part of the world -- will change the culture of this part of the world -- and it will have a political impact , " said @entity14 , @entity9 's country manager in @entity3			2
" we believe it is absolutely the right time to give people hopes and dreams -- not to be rich and famous , but hopes and dreams to be helpful			0
" on monday , @entity9 employees plan to start a tour of @entity3 in a bus that 's emblazoned with the @entity9 logo			1
