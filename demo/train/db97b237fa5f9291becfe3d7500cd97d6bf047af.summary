@entity0 -- ending a decade - long campaign led by @entity5 lawmakers , the @entity2 wednesday approved and sent to president @entity6 a measure to reduce the disparity in penalties between use of crack and powder cocaine			1
under a 25 - year - old law , mandatory minimum sentences involving crack cocaine -- a drug more commonly used by blacks than whites -- led to far more severe penalties than for offenses involving powder cocaine , generally preferred by whites			1
" @entity26 will reduce sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine from 100 - to - 1 to 18 - to - 1 , " said congressman @entity23 , @entity24 , who applauded the passage			1
@entity23 said the crack mandatory sentences had pushed the number of drug offenders in federal prisons from fewer than 5,000 in 1980 to nearly 100,000 in 2009			1
the law drops the five - year mandatory sentence for first time offenders , and for repeat offenders with less than 28 grams of crack			1
current law sets the mandatory sentence for conviction at five grams			2
support for reducing the disparity with powder cocaine offenders increased with reports beginning in 2002 by the @entity43 calling for @entity44 to change the crack cocaine law			1
the commission is independent agency in the judicial branch that develops national sentencing policy for the federal courts			0
the @entity2 measure , passed on a voice vote with bipartisan support , follows passage by the @entity54 in march			0
president @entity6 and attorney general @entity56 had both pressed for passage of the law			0
" this day was long in coming , " said @entity56			0
he said the bill will " go a long way toward ensuring that our sentencing laws are tough , consistent , and fair			0
" members of the @entity65 had led the battle for passage for 10 years			0
@entity56 also singled out key @entity68 including sens. @entity69 , @entity70 , and @entity71 , @entity73 - @entity72 , who had joined with @entity74			0
@entity23 tipped his hat to @entity2 @entity68 members @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 , @entity82 , for their support			2
not all @entity68 joined the majority , however			0
the top @entity68 on the @entity86 @entity85 , @entity82 , argued vigorously shortly before passage that to reduce the crack cocaine penalties would be a serious mistake			1
" reducing the penalties for crack cocaine could expose our neighborhoods to the same violence and addiction that caused @entity44 to act in the first place , " @entity85 said			1
" crack cocaine is associated with a greater degree of violence than most other drugs			2
and more than any other drug , the majority of crack defendants have prior criminal convictions , " @entity85 said			2
the @entity2 is expected to schedule a presidential signing ceremony within a month .			0
