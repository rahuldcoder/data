-- here is what the election next year is about : the fence - sitters , the independent voters			1
at this point , there is not much president @entity7 can say that will win over conservatives , and given the current @entity11 field , he does n't have to worry too much about losing liberals			2
but what can he say to convince the middle to give him four more years ? well , he could start by , to paraphrase @entity15 , giving them something to talk about			2
vice president @entity18 ? now that 's a talker			2
of course if @entity11 do something silly like saddle themselves with @entity25 or another polarizing figure , whose politics or past makes the nominee too unappealing to us independents , then there wo n't be a need for such a change at the top			0
however , if a moderate does make it out of the @entity11 , and @entity7 looks to be in a dogfight , i ca n't think of a ticket that would generate more wattage than @entity7 - @entity38 ' 12			1
would the move be characterized by critics as an obvious ploy to attract women ? well , yeah			0
and to a degree they 'll be right : after all , this is politics			0
but the critics would have to tread lightly , because @entity38 would likely be at least as accomplished , and probably more so , than any other person on either ballot			1
this would not be @entity7 pulling a @entity50 , selecting someone who is n't qualified in hopes of injecting fresh blood into a struggling campaign			1
if @entity38 had to take over the presidency , i think many people on both sides can agree that scenario would be much more desirable than one in which @entity61 was running the show			1
in fact , comparing @entity38 's pedigree to @entity61 's or @entity11 presidential candidate @entity65 's is like comparing an oak tree to a handful of seaweed			1
if @entity38 was robbed before , she would receive recompense in 2012 , and by 2016 be in an even stronger position to be the first female president than she was in 2008			1
@entity7 selecting @entity38 as his running mate in 2008 , after a sometimes biting primary season , would have rung hollow			1
now , after she 's spent four years working with him as secretary of state , an executive partnership would be accepted as authentic			0
this fall she said she had no interest in running for public office , which is not the same as saying she wo n't run			0
the reason why she was even approached with the question is because a fall @entity85 poll found 34 % of @entity86 believe the country would 've been better if she 'd been in charge			0
former vice president @entity90 said he thought @entity38 was going to win the @entity92 nomination and that " she 's probably the most competent person they 've got in their @entity95 , " and he suggested she should run against @entity7 in another primary			1
of course @entity90 was pushing his new book and probably trying to sow dissent , but he did echo what most everyone in @entity102 knows -- @entity38 brings gravitas few people possess			2
if those who rallied around her presidential bid were to rally behind her for the vice-presidential nod , it 's hard to imagine who in the @entity11 field could match what she would bring			2
part of the reason that @entity7 is vulnerable is not simply that the economy is struggling and republicans are fired up to defeat him			2
it 's because his base does not appear to be fired up for him to win			0
quite a few high - profile supporters have expressed disappointment			0
quite a few low - profile supporters have expressed buyer 's remorse -- not for picking @entity7 over @entity50 but for selecting @entity7 over @entity38			1
putting her name on the ticket as vice president would give @entity7 something @entity129 never brought to the table -- buzz			1
that 's no knock on @entity129			0
ok , it is , but i 'm sure he knows he ca n't draw a crowd like @entity18			0
sure , we 're 11 months away , and given that @entity138 is the sixth @entity11 front - runner in less than a year -- including two with reality tv shows -- a lot can still happen			0
but there is no denying that the electricity @entity7 generated during the 2007 - 08 campaign is simply not there this time			1
some of his supporters are disappointed with the compromises he 's made since taking office			0
others are frustrated he has n't done more to help their specific community or interest group			0
and while the economy is improving , the recovery numbers are way too pedestrian to be used as an inspiring talking point for voters sitting on the fence			0
back in 2008 , political strategists on both sides of the aisle could offer a litany of reasons why @entity7 defeated @entity50 -- from the @entity11 candidate being framed as an extension of @entity164 , to @entity7 's charisma and an electorate excited by the opportunity to rewrite history			1
but a year from now , there wo n't be as many variables explaining why @entity7 won re-election			2
in fact , the rationale could likely summed up in one word : @entity18			0
@entity7 's one - time foe is now his ace in the hole			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180 .			2

@entity180 : an @entity7 - @entity38 re-election ticket would give new life to campaign
he says @entity38 , accomplished politician , could lure independent and women voters
he says the vice presidency would position her for a presidential run in 2016
@entity180 : @entity7 's former foe could be his ace in the hole
