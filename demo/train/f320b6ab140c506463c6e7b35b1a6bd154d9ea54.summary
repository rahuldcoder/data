@entity0 says she has n't decided yet when she 'll end her life , but it 's a decision she 's still determined to make			1
" i still feel good enough and i still have enough joy and i still laugh and smile with my family and friends enough that it does n't seem like the right time right now , " @entity3 says in a video released to @entity5 on wednesday			1
" but it will come , because i feel myself getting sicker			2
it 's happening each week			2
" @entity3 says she has @entity14 glioblastoma multiforme , an aggressive form of terminal brain cancer			1
in april , she says , doctors gave her six months to live			2
the 29 - year - old @entity21 woman 's story spread rapidly on social media after she revealed her plans to take medication to end her life			1
a video explaining her choice has garnered more than 8.8 million views on @entity29			1
and she 's become a prominent spokeswoman for the " death with dignity " movement , which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms			1
she 's also become a lightning rod for criticism from people who oppose that approach			0
in her latest statement , a nearly six - minute video produced and released by end - of - life choice advocacy group @entity43 , @entity3 acknowledges that some have been skeptical about her story			1
" when people criticize me for not waiting longer , or , you know , whatever they 've decided is best for me , it hurts , " she says , " because really , i risk it every day , every day that i wake up			1
" @entity43 spokesman @entity52 declined @entity5 's request to speak with @entity3 's doctors , saying they " prefer to remain anonymous for now because opponents of death with dignity sometimes harass doctors who write aid - in - dying prescriptions			1
" @entity3 says her health has been getting worse			0
she describes a recent " terrifying " day when she had two seizures and found herself unable to say her husband 's name			0
" i think sometimes people look at me and they think			0
' well you do n't look as sick as you say you are , ' which hurts to hear , because when i 'm having a seizure and i ca n't speak afterwards , i certainly feel as sick as i am , " she says , her voice cracking as she tears up			1
when she first started speaking out about her decision , @entity3 said she planned to take the medication she 'd been prescribed in early november			1
in her latest video , she says she 's still waiting to see how her symptoms progress before deciding on a date			1
but taking too long to make that choice is now one of her greatest fears , @entity3 says in the video			1
" the worst thing that could happen to me is that i wait too long because i 'm trying to seize each day , " she says , " but i somehow have my autonomy taken away from me by my disease because of the nature of my cancer			1
" national campaign @entity43 says the latest video , which was recorded on october 13 and 14 , is part of a campaign " to expand access to death with dignity in @entity98 and other states nationwide			1
" @entity3 was living in @entity98 when doctors diagnosed her with brain cancer			1
" we had to uproot from @entity98 to @entity21 , because @entity21 is one of only five states where death with dignity is authorized , " she said in an opinion column she wrote for @entity5 earlier this month			0
@entity21 , @entity108 and @entity109 have " death with dignity " laws that allow terminally ill , mentally competent residents to voluntarily request and receive prescription drugs to hasten their death			0
judicial decisions in @entity116 and @entity117 authorize doctors to prescribe fatal drug doses in such circumstances , although the rulings have n't become state law			1
now , changing that has become part of @entity3 's mission			0
" my goal , of course , is to influence this policy for positive change			0
and i would like to see all @entity132 have access to the same health care rights , " she says in her latest video			1
but she says she 's also focused on simpler goals			0
" they mostly do boil down to my family and friends and making sure they all know how important they are to me and how much i love them , " she says			0
family supports her decision the video also includes statements from @entity3 's family			1
her mother , @entity147 , says she supports her daughter			0
" it 's not my job to tell her how to live , and it 's not my job to tell her how to die , " she says			0
" it 's my job to love her through it			0
" her husband , @entity157 , says they 're taking things day by day			0
" that 's the only way to get through this			0
you take away all of the material stuff , all the nonsense that we all seem to latch onto as a society , " he says , " and you realize that those moments are really what matter			0
" last week , @entity3 visited the @entity171 -- a trip she described as the last item on her bucket list			0
photos on her website showed her and her husband standing on the edge of the canyon , hugging and kissing			0
in the video , @entity3 says she 's hoping her mother and husband will be able to bounce back after her death			1
" i understand everyone needs to grieve , but i want him to be happy , so i want him to have a family , " she says			0
" and i know that might sound weird , but there 's no part of me that wants him to live out the rest of his life just missing his wife , so i hope he moves on and becomes a father			2
" debate over ' death with dignity ' the so - called " death with dignity " movement is opposed by many religious and right - to - life groups , which consider it assisted suicide			1
and @entity3 's decision has drawn criticism from some religious leaders			0
" we believe she 's made in the image of @entity214 , we believe that @entity214 determined when she would be born and @entity214 should determine when she 's going to die , " @entity208 , pastor of @entity209 of @entity210 , told @entity5 's @entity211 earlier this month			0
and when i read the story , i prayed for the woman and her family			0
i ca n't imagine the agony for a decision like this			2
but i do n't think that necessarily we 're saying the right things about death			2
" what if @entity3 had showed a gun in her video , instead of a pill bottle , he asked			2
@entity229 , a @entity230 seminarian who says he was also diagnosed with incurable brain cancer , criticized @entity3 's choice			1
" a diagnosis of terminal cancer uproots one 's whole life , and the decision to pursue physician - assisted suicide seeks to grasp at an ounce of control in the midst of turmoil , " he wrote in a column posted on the @entity234 of @entity236 's website			1
" it is an understandable temptation to take this course of action , but that is all that it is -- a temptation to avoid an important reality of life			2
" but polls have shown that most @entity132 support having a say in how they die , especially if the process is described not as doctors helping a patient " commit suicide " but as ending a patient 's life " by some painless means			2
" " i think there is something of a movement here , " @entity263 , professor of bioethics at @entity266 's @entity265 , told @entity5 's @entity267 earlier this month			0
" when you push @entity132 to say , ' do you want choice on this matter ? ' i think a lot of them are going to say yes			0
" @entity263 said @entity3 's first video speaking out about her decision raised some concerns			2
" i would n't want her to feel pressure that she had to do it because she just told us all she was going to , " he said			2
@entity3 has stressed that she is n't suicidal			2
" if all my dreams came true , i would somehow survive this , " she says in her latest video , " but most likely , i wo n't			1
