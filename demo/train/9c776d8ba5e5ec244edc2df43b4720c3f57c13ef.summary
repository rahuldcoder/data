-- there is an old @entity3 proverb : " if you want to walk fast , walk alone			2
but if you want to walk far , walk together			0
" that was the guiding principle behind the @entity6 on @entity7 this week in @entity8 , the capital of @entity9			1
this is the fourth such annual conference -- and the first to be held on @entity3 soil			2
the roundtable brought together @entity14 and @entity3 health ministry officials , academics , members of the private sector , and representatives of such international organizations as the @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity25 entities			1
over two days , we tackled such topics as malaria , @entity29 , reproductive health , and schistosomiasis â € ” health issues that @entity14 has largely brought under control but remain major health challenges in @entity3			1
@entity14 and the countries of @entity3 have much to unite them			1
we fought to free ourselves from colonialism ; we view health as a key building block for economic development ; and we are learning to build upon traditional economic development models that have allowed our societies to make progress			2
sharing these values and history , we are pioneering a new @entity47 - to - @entity47 model based on mutual interests and respect			2
to be sure , there is a long history of @entity14 and @entity3 collaboration on health			1
in the 1960s , @entity14 began sending medical teams to the continent			2
more recently , @entity14 has built hospitals and medical centers in many @entity3 countries			1
@entity14 has also provided medical training to @entity3 health professionals and is building capacity in other ways , such as providing scholarships to train health experts			1
going forward , we all foresee a stronger collaboration			0
many @entity3 countries could benefit from low - cost , high - quality @entity14 - made health products			1
@entity14 has made enormous strides in the manufacture of drugs , vaccines and other health products			1
it is the world 's largest producer of the active ingredients for malaria treatments and antiretroviral drugs against hiv / aids			0
@entity14 also makes implantable contraceptive devices that provide women with birth control for several years			0
@entity14 also makes simple and inexpensive rings allowing men to be circumcised , which can greatly reduce the risk of contracting @entity88 , without undergoing surgery			0
@entity14 can also provide refrigeration equipment and logistical support for the " cold chains " needed to safely deliver many vaccines to remote communities			0
all these have great relevance to @entity3			0
but collaboration is a two - way street			0
participants at the meeting shared lessons learned in delivering health services to their people			0
many countries , including @entity9 and @entity105 , have made enormous gains in preventing mother - to - child transmission of @entity88 , even in rural areas			1
@entity14 can learn much from this progress as it provides services to its remote communities			0
the relationship between @entity14 and @entity3 has of course been long and complex , and not without misunderstandings			1
@entity14 investment in @entity3 has gained global attention because of its scale			2
@entity14 - built roads , buildings , dams , airports , hospitals and railways are visible across the continent			1
so , too , are the tensions that have on occasion emerged due to different styles of management and communication			0
this is why these face - to - face meetings are so valuable			0
they pave the way for our long walk together			0
we are also grateful so many international organizations are joining us for this journey			0
they bring a wealth of experience working in both @entity3 and @entity14 and can help bridge many technical gaps that @entity47 - to - @entity47 collaboration can not address			1
the results of this partnership will be sustainable , @entity3 - owned solutions to many of the continent 's greatest health challenges			1
of course , we still have far to walk before all people with @entity29 , malaria and @entity152 receive the treatments and dignity they deserve ; before all children are immunized ; before all women have access to safe and effective contraception ; and before neglected tropical diseases are eradicated forever			0
but , i am encouraged that we are walking together , and in the right direction			0
it 's only fair , since i opened with an @entity3 proverb , to close with a @entity14 saying : " numerous grains of earth make a mountain ; numerous drops of water form an ocean			2
" as long as we keep advancing @entity14 - @entity3 cooperation , we will build those mountains , fill those oceans and provide all of our people with the sustainable health solutions they deserve .			1
