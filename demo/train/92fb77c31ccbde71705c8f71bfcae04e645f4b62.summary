-- champions @entity1 began the defense of their @entity5 title with a hard fought 1 - 0 win against @entity7 in @entity8 on tuesday			1
playing their first qualifier in @entity11 , the 2010 @entity5 winners had to wait until the 86th minute before striker @entity12 finally broke down a stubborn @entity7 side			0
for much of the game , the home team , who hit the post early in the second half , defended with 10 men behind the ball against a side who retained their @entity24 crown in july			0
goalkeeper @entity26 had proved an immovable barrier but after he was replaced due to injury late in the second half , substitute @entity25 teed up @entity12 to sweep home			0
the win maintains @entity1 's two - year unbeaten run in competitive matches , which stretches back to their 1 - 0 loss against @entity35 in their opening game at the @entity37 in @entity38			1
@entity1 are second in their group , three points behind 1998 champions @entity43 , who won their second match in four days when overcoming a second - half wobble to beat @entity47 3 - 1 in @entity48 , with goals from @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52			1
in @entity54 , @entity53 suffered a scare when trailing @entity56 for long periods before @entity58 scored a late penalty to earn a 1 - 1 draw , after @entity61 had curled home in the first half			1
@entity53 captain @entity64 was sent off for a second yellow card shortly after @entity58 's penalty , as a first competitive game at @entity68 for coach @entity69 lacked the feelgood factor that has accompanied local sportsmen in @entity54 in recent weeks during the @entity72 and @entity73			1
@entity69 's predecessor @entity74 enjoyed a more fruitful evening as his new @entity76 side won 4 - 0 in @entity77 while their next opponents -- and main @entity79 rivals @entity80 -- needed late goals from @entity82 and @entity83 to add gloss to a labored 3 - 0 win over @entity86 in @entity87			2
@entity90 , the runners - up at this year 's @entity89 , were another leading nation who struggled to overcome less fancied opponents , as a stoppage - time own goal helped the four time world champions to a 2 - 0 win over islanders @entity98			2
one of tuesday 's more intriguing games took place in @entity101 , where hosts @entity35 beat @entity102 2 - 0 to go top of @entity104 build - up to the game had been dominated by the issue of players with @entity110 heritage , with six starting the match for @entity102 and three more for @entity35 -- midfield trio @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity115 star @entity114			0
born to ethnic @entity117 parents from @entity110 , @entity114 was constantly booed by the sizable away support until the @entity120 player silenced them when opening the scoring after 23 minutes			0
elsewhere , big guns @entity122 maintained their 100 % start in @entity126 when beating @entity127 2 - 1 in @entity128 , while @entity129 stunned @entity131 rivals @entity130 with a 6 - 1 win in @entity133 but the night 's biggest winners were @entity135 , who won 6 - 0 in @entity137 .			0

@entity1 win 1 - 0 in @entity7 thanks to 86th minute strike from @entity12
@entity53 are held 1 - 1 at @entity68 by @entity56 as captain @entity64 is sent off
@entity43 , @entity80 and @entity90 make hard work of beating @entity47 , @entity86 and @entity98
