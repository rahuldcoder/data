@entity1 's military declared thursday that it has taken control of the country in a coup			1
two days earlier , the military declared martial law , saying the aim was to calm tensions			1
what 's fueling the situation in @entity1 ? what could happen next ? and why should you be paying attention ? here 's a guide to understanding the country 's fast - moving crisis : what 's the latest ? details are sketchy , but @entity1 's military chief announced thursday in a national address that the armed forces had taken control of the country after rival factions were unable to reach an agreement to govern			1
on tuesday , the military declared martial law without consulting the country 's interim prime minister , who was serving in a caretaker status after former prime minister @entity31 -- also a caretaker -- was ousted by @entity1 's @entity32			1
an aide to interim prime minister @entity34 described tuesday 's move by the military as " half a coup d'etat			1
" there 's been no reaction from @entity34 's camp so far			0
the country remains under martial law , which among other things includes restrictions on where protesters can gather , what tv and radio broadcasters can air and social media posts , according to the @entity48			1
@entity1 wakes up to military rule : what it means how did things get to this point ? @entity1 's politics have been in turmoil for years , driven in large part by a schism between populists , many of them rural and poor , and a largely urban middle class and elite in @entity61 partial to the nation 's royal establishment			1
the current disruption has its roots in the 2006 military ouster of billionaire prime minister @entity67 , who built a strong political base with populist policies that appealed to rural villagers in @entity1 's north			1
@entity67 's removal led to a broad - based opposition movement that came to a head with widespread demonstrations in parts of @entity61 in 2010			0
the military violently suppressed the protests , resulting in some 90 deaths			0
a year later @entity67 's sister , @entity31 , rode a wave of opposition votes into power			0
in 2013 , @entity31 proposed legislation that would have granted amnesty to @entity67 and others			0
the move set off a new wave of protests and anger -- this time among @entity61 's urban elites and middle class sometimes known as " @entity94 " -- who want an end to the involvement of @entity67 's family in @entity1 politics for good			1
in may , @entity1 's @entity32 removed @entity31 and nine cabinet ministers from office , saying she had violated the @entity102 by reassigning a senior security official in 2011			1
populists known as " @entity105 " saw her ouster as a " judicial coup " and have been protesting what they consider a bias by many of the country 's institutions against their side			2
things escalated last week when three @entity116 protesters died and 23 were injured after gunmen opened fire on a protest camp			0
the violence prompted an ominous warning from the army chief that troops would have to step in if the situation did n't calm down			2
what 's next ? before the coup , the army chief , gen. @entity126 , said the next step would be bringing " rival parties to talk in peace			1
" it was n't immediately clear if such negotiation is still on the table , or if the military has other plans			0
previously , @entity136 , a political science professor at @entity137 in @entity61 , said the military was in a precarious situation			2
" they have to be evenhanded , " he said at the time			0
" if it 's seen as favoring one side or the other side , then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military , " he said			0
has anything like this ever happened before in @entity1 ? @entity1 is no stranger to military coups			2
including thursday 's coup , the military has attempted 19 coups in 80 years ; 12 have been successful			2
before thursday , the last one was in 2006 when the military sent tanks onto the streets before ousting @entity67			0
soldiers , selfies and martial law why should i care about this ? @entity1 's political instability could have an impact beyond the country 's borders			1
" known as the ' @entity167 , ' @entity1 has risen to become a vital manufacturing and assembly hub of hard - disk drives and automobiles for @entity173 and @entity174 firms , " the @entity164 said in a december analysis of the political crisis			1
the months of protests have already hurt @entity1 's economy and run the risk of making the country less attractive to investors and governments looking to strike up deals , analysts said			1
" a reputation for perpetual political unrest would definitely hurt @entity1 's competitiveness and attractiveness to foreign investment in the future , " the analysis said			1
a recent report from the @entity192 @entity191 noted that " @entity61 's reliability as a partner , and its ability to be a regional leader , are uncertain			0
" " a stable @entity1 is strategically important to the @entity192 , both because of its status as a @entity192 treaty ally and as an anchor for mainland @entity200 , " the report said			2
" @entity192 policymakers are faced with how to deal with an unraveling democracy and how to respond to profound concerns about the civilian - military balance in @entity1 society			2
how does it compare to what we 've seen in other countries ? around the world , we 've heard a lot about coups recently			0
in @entity215 , some troops have been arguing that increasing military power that 's rallying behind a renegade local general is n't anything about which to worry			0
but the @entity215 government and the military command in @entity221 reacted with alarm , saying that they did n't order retired gen. @entity224 's deadly attacks against @entity226 militants last week , and that the operation -- which they conceded included some @entity215 soldiers -- amounted to a coup			2
in february , @entity232 's president claimed a coup had forced him from office , while lawmakers said they were following the will of the people when parliament voted to oust him and hold new elections			0
a military coup in @entity242 last year ousted president @entity243 from office and placed an interim leader in power			0
a debate surged afterward about whether a coup was an appropriate term to use for the ouster .			0

@entity252 declares coup as @entity1 remains under martial law
it 's *unclear* what will happen next ; army had sought political dialogue
the *volatile* political situation has affected @entity1 's economy
