-- @entity1 and @entity2 may be counting the hours until their wedding this saturday , but the day will be bittersweet			1
the couple 's 2 - year - old son , @entity5 , is dying			1
though @entity5 was given just weeks to live , the couple , from @entity8 , @entity9 , about 40 minutes from @entity10 , plans to honor him as their best man			1
the pictures show a sweet , young boy , deeply loved by his family			0
his mother , @entity16 , spoke to @entity0			0
" me and @entity2 wanted to have a nice wedding next july , " she said			1
" there 's no way i can get married and not have @entity5 in our family photos			1
" and certainly , @entity5 will shine in his fine wedding suit			1
with 120 to 130 wedding guests , there will be plenty to celebrate			0
@entity16 often talks about how @entity5 's a fighter who 's always stayed strong			1
born on october 22 , 2010 , he weighed just 3 pounds			0
eating troubles kept @entity5 in the hospital , but he kept fighting , kept growing , and was soon home with his parents and his two older sisters			1
@entity16 originally hoped to call him @entity2 , after his dad , but @entity2 disagreed			0
so one day , while leafing through a baby naming book , @entity2 stumbled onto " @entity5 , " and it felt perfect to them both			2
and for his first year , he grew , he was healthy , and he made his family unspeakably happy			2
even today , as his life nears an end , @entity16 struggles to find words to say what an amazing little boy he is			0
just after @entity5 's first birthday , @entity16 noticed that he was n't feeling well again , and his lips and fingernails had turned white			1
over the course of a month , she took @entity5 to the pediatrician four times before the head pediatrician tended to him			1
when he did , he quickly called 911			0
@entity16 says @entity5 shocked doctors at the @entity10 children 's hospital			1
his leukemia had progressed so far , they were surprised he was still alive			0
@entity52 was started right away , taking an extraordinary toll on his body			0
@entity2 and @entity16 learned more devastating news shortly after : @entity5 has a genetic disorder called @entity58 anemia , which most frequently results in death , most commonly from cancer , between the ages of 25 and 30			2
but @entity5 fought hard , just like he had done as a newborn			2
he landed in the @entity63 but pulled through , and by july 13 , 2012 , doctors were prepared to give him a blood stem cell transplant			0
after his stem cell treatment , he was free of leukemia for nine months , eating and acting like any other child			0
life started to feel normal for @entity5 's family , but @entity16 's gut feeling returned when she saw @entity5 acting strange again			1
it was cancer again : a mass the size of an orange on @entity5 's larger and better - functioning kidney			1
doctors had no choice but to remove the kidney , just a week before @entity81 of this year			2
life gained a long - sought - after normalcy for @entity5 and the family , except for the twice - weekly visits to a clinic for his chemotherapy			1
the therapy , though not a perfect solution for @entity5 , would hopefully prevent a recurrence of the cancer , despite being a lower dose than average			2
@entity5 's life continued to improve			1
" he was eating bowl after bowl " of spaghetti , " it was a wonderful feeling , " @entity16 says			0
but then he started getting fevers , then throwing up			0
his left side swelled as the mass returned , where the kidney once was			0
" i thought he was doing so well ... it 's like you take two steps forward , 15 back , " @entity16 says			0
the doctors told @entity5 's family that they could only do more harm than good			1
and in june , as the family 's fortunes continued to fail , the @entity113 gave them a trip to @entity116			2
but after just four hours there , @entity5 was back in the hospital			2
eight days of torture ensued , as he had developed an infection and eventually needed to be flown home to @entity8			0
finally , on july 26 , doctors gave @entity5 one to two weeks to live			1
but the wedding that @entity2 and @entity16 planned for next year certainly could n't happen without him			1
so with the help of friends and family , it has been moved to saturday , not in a banquet hall , but in the family 's backyard " because it may make @entity5 uncomfortable " to be in strange surroundings with so much noise			1
his once big , beautiful curls are no longer atop his head , but his handsome suit will be pressed as @entity5 will be by his dad 's side on the wedding day			1
@entity16 does n't refer to it as the end for @entity5 , but as the start of his " journey			2
" she is " a different person			0
i 'm a better person ; he 's made me a strong person			0
" the strength is in her voice , in her resolve to have her son in her wedding , and she 's thankful for it			2
" he has brought so much joy into our lives			0
i could n't have asked for a better son .			0

doctors say @entity5 , 2 , has less than a month to live
his parents wanted him to be their best man in a wedding they *'d* planned for next year
@entity5 's *diagnosis* moved the wedding to saturday
