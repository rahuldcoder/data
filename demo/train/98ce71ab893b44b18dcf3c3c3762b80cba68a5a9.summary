if you use @entity1 , and i know you do , you may have noticed a little banner popping up at the top of the page announcing : " we 're changing our privacy policy and terms			1
" it gives you the choice to " learn more " or , another option , the one i 'm betting most people followed , to " dismiss			0
" who wants to read about what @entity1 plans to do with all that information it has about us ? @entity18 , too , clicked " @entity19			1
" that 's because the very idea of considering what @entity1 knows about me can give me heartburn			1
and if that happens , i may want to @entity1 " heartburn , " and then i 'll wonder if my insurance company will find out that i was searching " heartburn , " or , worse , that one day i will apply for a new insurance company and the side effects of having considered what @entity1 knows will result in a denial of coverage			2
when @entity1 announced its new policy , lovingly explaining its reason as " our desire to create one beautifully simple and intuitive experience across @entity1 , " the authorities in @entity34 immediately told the @entity40 leviathan to put off its march 1 start date until @entity43 officials had a chance to review @entity1 's new quest for beauty and simplicity			1
@entity34 , it turns out , are much less trusting of invasions of our electronic privacy than @entity53 are			1
@entity53 have an intense aversion to government intrusion			2
if the @entity60 wanted to examine @entity1 searches , the left and the right would come together -- the @entity56 , @entity57 , liberals and libertarians would raise their fists together to fight for freedom of privacy			1
the @entity67 would join in , as it did in the case of gps surveillance , and conclude the people have a right to privacy , a right against any " unreasonable search , " as the @entity73 says			0
but in the case of @entity1 's latest move to consolidate user 's data , however , most @entity53 paid little attention			1
@entity79 : we 're losing control of our digital privacy if @entity53 -- or people anywhere -- decided to take up @entity1 's offer to check out its new policy , they would discover something so troubling , so frightening , really , that it would override the national tendency to leave companies alone to make money how they see fit			1
at least in the case of companies such as @entity1 -- and now @entity93 -- which know more about us than even our closest friends			1
here 's what @entity1 knows about you , what it stores right there on its servers , waiting for a hacker : @entity1 has every e-mail you ever sent or received on @entity105			1
it has every search you ever made , the contents of every chat you ever had over @entity110			0
it holds a record of every telephone conversation you had using @entity114 , it knows every @entity115 you 've set up			0
it has your @entity117 with all content going back as far as you 've used it , including everything you 've done every day since then			0
it knows your contact list with all the information you may have included about yourself and the people you know			0
it has your @entity128 pictures , your news page configuration , indicating what topics you 're most interested in			0
if you ever used @entity1 while logged in to your account to search for a person , a symptom , a medical side effect , a political idea ; if you ever gossiped using one of @entity1 's services , all of this is on @entity1 's servers			1
and thanks to the magic of @entity1 's algorithms , it is easy to sift through the information because @entity1 search works like a charm			1
@entity1 can even track searches on your computer when you 're not logged in for up to six months			2
@entity93 has even more interesting stuff : your pictures , your comments , your likes , your friends , your un-friends			2
@entity157 : we must avoid @entity93 's ' creepy ' cult of transparency you 've done it , said it , clicked it , searched it , googled it			1
you can never undo it or unclick it			0
unless the people demand that government order a stop to it			0
the @entity175 has a new privacy proposal known as the " right to be forgotten			0
" it would allow internet users in 27 countries of the @entity43 to demand @entity40 companies delete their personal data			0
@entity1 's famous motto is " do no evil			1
" i wo n't accuse @entity1 of deliberately doing evil			2
it has done much to improve our lives			0
it makes no secret of the fact that it seeks to make profits , which it richly deserves			0
i do believe , however , that it deliberately tries to deceive us when it claims the new privacy policy seeks " to provide you with as much transparency and choice as possible			1
" i followed the instructions and with some difficulty eventually downloaded pages upon pages of personal material about myself from @entity1			2
what i was looking for was a simple , shall we say beautiful , button telling @entity1 not to save anything i do n't explicitly want it to save			2
but there was no such button			0
@entity1 , like @entity93 , owns trillions if not quadrillions - plus bits of information			1
they mine it , use it to sell ads , algorithm it			0
but my real fear is not @entity1			2
my real fear is that computer technology has turned into an arms race between good guys and bad guys			0
@entity1 may see itself as a jaunty white hat wearer , valiantly protecting all our information			1
and it may be doing it to the best of its ability			0
but hackers are hard at work all the time			0
@entity1 and @entity93 are profiting from our private information in ways most of us do n't quite understand or would approve			1
but hackers may do even worse , as we have already seen in many cases around the world			0
hackers have already unlocked and put on the web reams of credit card information , private documents and all sorts of personal e-mails			2
imagine your e-mails and chats on the web for anyone to read			0
online hoarding of our private information is not something we can afford to " dismiss			1
" the only effective way to change the ways of these giant corporations -- and the smaller ones following the same practices -- is by pushing the government to make those practices illegal			0
we can start by following @entity34 's example			1
the obvious , ethical , default setting should affirm that our private information belongs to us and nobody else -- not to @entity1 , not to @entity93			1
we should call for laws that require them to change their terms of service so users have the option of giving or denying permission to them on holding personal data in storage			0
follow @entity271 on @entity272 join the conversation on @entity93			2

@entity1 recently changed its privacy policy to consolidate user 's data
@entity281 : if @entity53 paid more attention , they would be troubled by the new policy
@entity284 : our private information belongs to us and nobody else -- not to @entity1 , not to @entity93
she says we should follow @entity34 's example and call for changes in law
