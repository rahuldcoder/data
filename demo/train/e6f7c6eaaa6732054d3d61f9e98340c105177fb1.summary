look out @entity0 , one of the world 's fastest motor sports wants to steal your fans			1
we 're talking about air racing , where powerful , small planes compete on a looped path in the air , reaching speeds between 200 - 500 mph			1
this thrilling sport is just as fast as @entity0 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
but with the added vertical dimension , the action seriously amps up			0
in @entity19 terms , it 's @entity20 - meets - @entity21 - meets - @entity22			1
it 's not quite the " podracers " that raced in " @entity26 , " but it 's pretty intense			1
picture these planes streaking across the landscape at only 80 feet above the ground			0
that 's about the same height as a seven - story building			1
some people might go one step further and call it nuts			1
it 's been going on since @entity37 hosted the first air race in 1909			1
in the @entity40 , races started a year later and gained momentum in the 1920s , drawing pilots , thrill seekers and aviation enthusiasts			1
related story : excitement , speed key to air racing appeal three years ago , a deadly plane crash at the @entity51 raised new safety questions about the sport			1
now , insiders say these events are safer and poised for growth			1
this weekend , some of the world 's best air racers are competing in an international air race series owned by @entity61 at the @entity62 , a few miles north of the @entity63			1
in @entity61 's version of air racing , planes rocket around a loop one at a time			1
the pilot who can complete the course in the least amount of time wins			0
@entity61 is holding races this year in @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity40 and the @entity75			1
it 's " very analogous to dogfighting , " says race director @entity78 , referring to the deadly midair combat ballet between two fighter planes			1
" it 's the exact same skill set			1
" @entity78 knows what he 's talking about			2
he 's a retired captain and former instructor at the @entity85 's famous fighter pilot school , unofficially known as @entity20			2
and it shows -- right down to the way he talks			2
this former f - 14 tomcat driver loves to talk about " angle of attack , " " proficiency level " and " pulling @entity89			0
" it is those @entity94 forces that are so important to surviving this sport			0
when these planes make breathtaking turns , they 're being radically pulled and pushed in ways that can challenge the structure of the aircraft and the health of the pilot			0
some pilots report pulling as many as @entity105 during races , equivalent to 10 times the force of gravity			2
the pilots are " flying extremely aggressive , in very tight locations , " @entity78 says			0
for most sports fans , " it 's not something you 've ever seen before			2
" the planes fly so low that spectators who sit in the grandstand nosebleed seats will actually be able to look down on the planes as they shoot by			0
the course includes inflatable , 82 - foot pylons			0
pilots are supposed to fly between these pylons			0
they 're not supposed to hit them			0
but sometimes -- traveling at 230 mph -- it happens			2
" when you hit them under a humongous amount of @entity89 , then it can be a little bit exciting , " says pilot @entity125			0
" basically you slice through , like a hot knife through butter			0
just , boom -- and you 're through it			2
" the pilots are racing against time , but it 's hard to keep an eye on the clock while you 're twisting and turning through the gates			1
@entity125 says his @entity140 aircraft does n't have any kind of special " head - up " display in front of the windshield that would let him keep his eyes forward while watching his time			0
widely described as one of the world 's greatest stunt pilots and racing aviators , @entity125 won @entity61 's @entity154 championship in 2004 and 2006			1
flying comes so naturally to this guy that he says he feels like his plane 's " wings are nothing but an extension of my arms			2
" the key to winning , pilots say , is pulling through the turns fast -- but not so fast that you lose speed			2
it 's a delicate balance that @entity78 says good fighter pilots share with champion air racers			1
nonetheless , that does n't mean you have to be an ex-fighter jockey to excel			0
@entity125 has never flown in the military			0
he graduated to air racing after piloting @entity176 737s for @entity177			1
before that , " i loved motocross as a kid , " @entity125 said			0
" i was always a speed junky			0
" the @entity61 series launched in 2003 , but by the end of the decade rising speeds and scary aerobatics were making race organizers nervous			1
so , beginning in 2011 , they put the series on pause to regroup			0
this year it 's back with new safety restrictions limiting how low pilots can fly and banning certain trick maneuvers			2
the rules surrounding air races differ			1
in the @entity40 , one of the oldest events is the national championship in @entity199 , where multiple planes race each other around a circuit			1
the first pilot across the finish line wins			0
the 2011 crash at @entity199 raised serious questions about safety			2
during a six - lap race , a modified @entity209 - era @entity208 flying at about 500 mph went out of control and collided with an airport ramp in the spectator seating area			0
the pilot and 10 people were killed and 64 others were hurt			2
investigators blamed " deteriorated " parts that contributed to fatigue cracks that led to the crash			2
related story : speed , worn parts contributed to @entity199 crash the tragedy led to new @entity226 rules requiring all air racing organizations to go through a standardized safety accreditation process			1
" they check the capability , skill set and training of the pilots , " says @entity78			0
they also monitor aircraft maintenance and the mechanics who work on the planes			0
" they really look at the full scope of your operation			0
" the 2011 @entity199 crash was believed to be the first in the 50 - year history of the event to kill spectators			2
last month , during a @entity199 qualifying race , a former champion was killed when his experimental @entity251 gp - 5 aircraft crashed , away from spectator seating , bringing the total deaths at @entity199 events to 20 since the races began in 1964			1
@entity61 boasts zero deaths in the 11 years since the series began , and only one pilot injury from a crash into a river during an @entity262 practice run in 2010			1
" our record shows that we 've been doing a good job -- knock on wood , " @entity78 says			2
" it 's actually safer than some of these other sports that are out there			1
" a newcomer to the sport might assume racing with other planes -- as they do in @entity199 -- would be more dangerous than racing one at a time			1
not necessarily , says @entity275 , president of the @entity276 , an industry trade organization			0
" i would n't say one is inherently safer than the other , " @entity275 says			2
" they each have a different set of safety challenges and they 've addressed them for the most part pretty successfully			0
the @entity199 planes are in some cases older ... but the @entity61 pilots participate in pretty aggressive aerobatics			1
" its strongest supporters believe @entity40 air racing can one day rival the popularity of @entity0			1
last year 's @entity293 drew nearly 70 million unique tv viewers in the @entity40 , according to @entity0			1
in 2009 , the @entity295 was televised in more than 180 countries , reaching more than 300 million viewers , @entity61 says , although it 's unclear how many viewers actually watched			1
the potential for growth is there , says @entity125			0
" i think in this country we love racing , " he says			0
" some people wonder if the sport is easy enough to understand			0
but it 's still a race			0
and the one thing we do understand is , the fastest ... is going to win			0

three years after a deadly crash , experts say air racing is safer and poised for growth
air racing has been around since the early 20th *century* , but few people have seen one
