@entity2 - backed @entity1 senate candidate @entity0 is weighing whether to challenge the results of his surprising @entity5 runoff loss to veteran incumbent @entity6			1
but @entity0 contends @entity6 's tactic of courting @entity9 support in a crossover primary was misplaced in a @entity5 election even though state law permits it			1
in a statement , @entity0 said the move was " unbecoming			1
" " in the case of yesterday 's election , we must be absolutely certain that our @entity5 primary was won by @entity5 voters , " he said			1
" in the coming days , our team will look into the irregularities to determine whether a challenge is warranted			2
" @entity9 turning out for @entity6 is just the tip of the iceberg in an already bizarre race marred by name - calling , mudslinging , allegations of cheating and a break - in at a nursing home where the senator 's bedridden wife lives			1
@entity6 was one of two longtime members of @entity35 who went into tuesday with their political fates hanging in the balance appear to have survived intra-party challenges			1
in a high - profile @entity42 primary , @entity40 rep. @entity39 emerged victorious in what he says is his last race , posting a second straight narrow win over the same opponent he faced two years ago when he barely kept his seat in the @entity49			1
" i want each one of you to go home and know that this was your victory , " he told supporters			2
" this is your congressman and you can rest assured that all i will be doing is thinking about you and bringing these resources home			0
" but @entity39 's challenger , state sen. @entity57 , was n't conceding on wednesday			1
5 things we learned from tuesday 's primaries @entity9 come out in @entity5 contest @entity1 has no recount provisions in its election laws			1
the only challenge to election results must go through the courts			2
@entity1 law allows anyone to vote in the runoff , meaning @entity9 could go to the polls as long as they had n't voted in the @entity9 primary and did n't plan to vote for their party 's candidate in the general election			1
by @entity78 's count , about 61,000 more people voted tuesday than in the primary two weeks ago			2
@entity6 's backers turned to @entity9 , especially @entity80 , who make up 37 % of the state 's population			1
they actively reminded voters of the senator 's work to secure federal funds for programs such as @entity88 and certain medical centers in the state			0
@entity91 , who helps run the @entity94 group @entity1 conservatives with his uncle , former gov. @entity95 , said he was proud that his organization was active in the effort to court @entity9 voters			1
" it just makes sense that you would talk to folks who are n't just like you			0
i think that 's a healthy thing			0
i think most people in @entity40 think that 's a good thing , " he said , arguing that the strategy could be helpful for other @entity5 nationwide , especially as the @entity5 works to rebrand its image			1
@entity95 also dismissed @entity0 's criticism of the strategy , saying his comments were " hogwash			1
" " i 'm afraid he 's wrong , " @entity95 said			0
" people have a right to vote and i 'm damn proud to have asked them for their support			2
" conservative groups supportive of @entity0 dispatched volunteers to observe poll workers to see if they were turning away those who already showed up in the @entity9 primary			1
but those efforts mobilized groups such as the @entity122 , which sent out its own volunteers to look for any signs of voter intimidation or interference			0
in his victory speech , @entity6 seemed to at least wink at the crossover voters , thanking supporters for getting them and his supporters to the polls			1
" you are the ones who helped reach all the voters , make sure that they knew that they were important to this election because it 's a group effort , it 's not a solo , " he told a victory celebration in @entity134			2
" and so we all have a right to be proud of our state tonight			0
thank you for this wonderful honor and wonderful challenge that lies ahead			2
" @entity0 outpolled @entity6 by about 1,400 votes in the june 3 primary but was forced into a runoff when he failed to cross the 50 % threshold to win outright			1
2014 midterm elections @entity39 's last dance ? @entity39 had said win or lose this race was his last campaign			1
the @entity157 veteran was trying to keep from getting pushed out of office by @entity57 , who came within about 1,100 votes of ousting @entity39 in the @entity9 primary two years ago			1
@entity39 , the former chairman of the tax - writing @entity161 , was forced to step down from that post in 2010 , and the @entity49 censured him for ethics violations later that year			1
just as damaging for @entity39 was the redrawing of @entity42 's 13th @entity165 after the 2010 election -- from a @entity168 - based , @entity80 - @entity80 - dominated district to one that now has a @entity171 majority , thanks to shedding parts of @entity168 and adding other neighborhoods in northern @entity175 and parts of the @entity177			1
@entity39 , the " @entity178 " and a founding member of the @entity180 , said he did n't put up much of a fight in 2012			2
" i did n't have a campaign last time			0
when he told me he was running , i was in @entity184 with a viral infection in my spine			0
" @entity57 said early wednesday he was n't giving in until all the votes were counted			0
he was down by 1,800 votes , with 99 % of the precincts counted , according to @entity191 numbers			0
" as we learned in 2012 , every single vote needs to be counted in this race			2
given the thousands of votes outstanding , the people of @entity175 and the @entity177 deserve a full accounting of every vote to achieve a complete and accurate tally in this race , " @entity57 said in a statement			2
tea party vs. establishment battle with a twist rep. @entity205 easily won @entity208 's @entity5 @entity207 primary in a race to succeed retiring @entity5 sen. @entity210			1
he defeated former state house speaker @entity211			0
@entity210 's announcement in january that he would step down at the end of the year -- with two years left in his term -- sparked a competitive primary in @entity208 to replace the conservative senator			1
there were seven candidates in the race , but the contest turned into a battle between the two front - runners : @entity223 and @entity211			0
for a party looking for more diversity , the 36 - year old @entity211 , who was the youngest speaker ever of the @entity49 , was an attractive choice			0
he 's part @entity227 and @entity80			0
he was backed by such tea party heroes as sen. @entity229 of @entity230 and former @entity232 gov. @entity231			0
and some national anti-establishment organizations pumped big bucks into the race in support of @entity211			0
but many local tea party groups kept their distance , with some questioning @entity211 's outsider credentials			0
in fact , @entity211 's no stranger to politics			0
he worked for @entity5 rep. @entity5 of @entity208 and former rep. @entity242 before launching his political career			1
@entity205 , who has risen through the ranks to become @entity246 chairman -- the fifth - ranking @entity49 @entity5 -- in two terms in @entity35 , was criticized by many on the right for his vote to raise the debt ceiling			1
but labeling the baptist minister with strong social conservative backing as an establishment candidate was a hard case to make			0
" the job is clear , " @entity205 repeated throughout his victory speech , ticking off a number of @entity5 positions on how to fix the economy , including repealing @entity260 , cutting down on environmental regulation and limiting federal spending			1
" i was a member of the class of 2010 in the @entity265			0
it was that class that moved @entity267 back to flying coach again , " he said			0
" if we win in november , i pray we can do this same thing for @entity229 ( @entity272 ) @entity271			0
" conceding the race , @entity211 said : " tonight this campaign is over , but our cause remains and our cause continues			0
" we must get rid of @entity271			0
that means we have to send @entity5 to the @entity207 , and that @entity5 is @entity205			1
" other races on our radar @entity78 projects that @entity281 lt. gov. @entity280 will win the state 's @entity9 gubernatorial primary			0
the two - term lieutenant governor faced off in an ugly primary battle against state attorney general @entity286 and state lawmaker @entity287			1
in a state dominated by @entity9 , @entity280 will now be considered the favorite in the general election to succeed term - limited @entity9 gov. @entity291			2
@entity280 was backed by @entity291 , a potential 2016 @entity9 presidential candidate , as well as former president @entity293			0
@entity280 will go on to face @entity5 @entity294 in the general election			2
if he wins in november , @entity280 would become the third african - american elected governor in @entity40 history			2
â € ¢ in @entity299 , @entity78 projects that former rep. @entity301 will win the @entity5 primary for governor , topping anti-immigration firebrand @entity304 , a former congressman and presidential hopeful , and two other candidates			1
@entity301 will face @entity9 gov. @entity309 in november			0
â € ¢ and in @entity311 , @entity5 businessman @entity310 won the special general election to replace embattled former rep. @entity313			1
@entity310 easily defeated democrat april @entity314 and two other candidates in the race for the state 's 19th @entity165			0
the heavily @entity5 district runs along @entity311 's @entity320 coast from @entity321 and @entity322 south to @entity323 and @entity324			2
@entity310 will serve out the remainder of @entity313 's term , which runs through the end of the year			0
there will be an august primary ahead of november 's general election			0
@entity313 , a fellow @entity5 , was arrested last year for cocaine possession , and he resigned from @entity35 in january .			2
