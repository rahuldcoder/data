-- @entity2 's 411 service will shut down for good on friday , but that does n't mean the end of free calls to business numbers			1
launched in 2007 , @entity7 was a free voice recognition search service for business listings drawn from the @entity11 directory			2
you 'd dial 800 - @entity7 ( or 877 - @entity7 ) , speak a search request ( business name or category ) into your phone , and @entity2 would list results in audio			2
when you selected a result , @entity2 would place the call -- which meant if the number was long - distance , the call would be free to you			1
according to @entity24 , some cost - conscious callers would call @entity7 to place free calls to business numbers -- using it like a " friends and family number			1
" i found this especially useful when calling tech support or customer service numbers -- which often , surprisingly , are n't toll - free			0
but , even without the @entity2 service , there 's still another way to get around charges for calls to business numbers			0
@entity40 's @entity39 suite of search tools offers a nearly identical service , called @entity39			0
according to this audio demo , it works almost like placing a normal 411 call through your phone company -- only without the hefty charges most phone companies levy for this service			0
@entity24 notes it takes 24 hours to update friends - and - family numbers with your phone provider , so this service is useful when you unexpectedly need to call a long - distance business number			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity57 .			0
