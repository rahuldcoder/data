it might sound like a @entity3 movie , but tennis authorities in @entity5 are hoping that the @entity7 format , which debuted monday with an exhibition match between world no. 2 @entity11 and former @entity12 and @entity14 champ @entity13 , could " revolutionize " the sport			1
that contest ended in the @entity19 star 's favor , beating his old friend and rival 4 - 3 2 - 3 3 - 4 4 - 0 4 - 3 at @entity23 's @entity22			1
this new version of tennis , which marks some of the most significant rule changes in the sport 's history , consists of the best - of - three sets with quick changeovers and sudden - death playoffs to prevent tiebreaks from dragging on			1
the first player to four games wins the set			0
" playing @entity11 in this new format will be an exciting challenge for both of us and a lot of fun , " said @entity13 ahead of the match			1
" it 's a fantastic innovation for tennis , and one that i hope will take off			0
" the @entity5 roadshow will decamp to @entity48 next , with @entity50 superstar @entity49 taking on three opponents in separate matches wednesday			1
first he 'll line up against former @entity14 finalist @entity53 before taking on current @entity14 junior champion @entity54 , finally playing a best - of - five match against compatriot @entity56			1
new game , new rules billed as tennis ' answer to cricket 's tv - friendly @entity62 , the two formats share more than just a catchy approach to branding			1
both take a fast - paced approach to sports that , for the uninitiated , could be considered soporific			2
@entity71 traditionally takes five days to play a test -- international -- match , and men 's singles tennis can last for hours , or in some rare cases , days			0
players will also have to hurry during end - changes , as there are no seating breaks and they get a scant 90 seconds to sit in between sets			2
a couple of more fundamental rule changes , including the removal of the service let rule -- that requires a server to retake their service if the ball hits the net cord -- and the removal of the advantage point			0
in @entity7 , the receiving player gets to choose which side the serve -- for a sudden death " power " point -- is directed to at deuce			0
faster , glitzier tennis @entity7 promises to provide some of the extravagance and glamor that , the majors aside , some evidently feel is missing from the sport			2
proponents hope that the truncated timeframe -- each set is supposed to last no more than 15 minutes , with games typically not lasting for much longer than an hour -- will allow for a greater number of people to find the time to play tennis			2
" the new format is a game changer and is set to revolutionize the game of tennis , particularly at club and social levels , " @entity115 ' s chief executive officer @entity114 said			2
" @entity122 today is precious and this new fast format is perfect for any player who wants to fit their tennis matches into a busy lifestyle			1
" @entity115 high performance coach @entity132 added : " our long term objective in creating a product like @entity7 tennis is to attract more people to the sport , and get more people to play tennis			0
" there 's no plan to replace traditional tennis , this is a great complementary product that is entertaining for fans and fun to play			0
" it 's not the only innovation that the sport is toying with			0
the @entity151 , " the first city - based professional league in the world , played across four countries , " debuted in november in 2014 .			0

new , quicker format debuts in @entity23
shorter matches , new time - *saving* rules and shorter changeover times promise to jazz up the sport
