-- yesterday , @entity1 disappeared from the @entity2			0
its replacement , simply titled @entity5 , is now available			2
this comes a little more than a month after @entity5 acquired @entity7 from its creator , @entity8			1
in addition to being free , the app now carries the distinction of being " version 3.0			1
" if you were expecting a big update and @entity16 support alongside the new name , brace yourselves ; @entity7 -- er -- @entity5 has remained relatively unchanged from its prior release			1
that 's not a bad thing ; as we reported in our original reviews of @entity23 and @entity7 2.1 , @entity7 is one of the best @entity5 experiences for any platform and , in our opinion , was the winning app on the @entity28 by a wide margin			1
that said , check out some of the new features and tweaks that you can find in the newly rebranded app : you can use @entity5 without an account			2
spy on your friends without having to actually use @entity5			0
you can sign up for a @entity5 account within the app itself , complete with @entity41			2
the " more " tab has been reorganized and popular actions have been moved to the main action bar			0
in acquiring @entity7 , @entity5 raised the ire of its developer community , who worried about what this means for their own applications now and in the future			1
@entity5 has argued that it needs to have an official client to improve basic user experience			0
earlier this month , @entity5 for @entity57 was released and @entity58 launched its own @entity5 application for the @entity60			2
this means that the three hottest smartphone platforms all have official @entity5 clients			0
if you never used @entity7 , we highly recommend downloading @entity5 for @entity28			1
it 's just a great application and now that it 's free , there 's really no excuse not to give it a try			0
