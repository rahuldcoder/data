@entity0 -- the @entity3 address is held in the @entity6 @entity5 chamber , where lawmakers , @entity9 officials and @entity11 justices crowd the floor			1
dignitaries and other invited guests pack the balcony			1
still more stand along the back and down the aisles			1
the hall is smaller than imagined			2
the din ahead of the annual event is broken when the main doors to the ornate room swing open and the sergeant at arms booms : " mr. speaker , the @entity26			1
" dating to @entity0 , there are few ceremonial moments like it in @entity0 , and the historic moment has never been lost on @entity31			2
the address -- or the floor of @entity34 -- has been a character , title or storyline in several films and tv shows over the years			1
remember the final scene in the movie @entity42 ? or the opening of @entity44 , season two of " @entity45 ? " but you wo n't find the actual @entity3 in the 1948 @entity48 movie called , well , " @entity3			1
" some appearances of the @entity3 addresses or dramatic speeches before @entity34 include : " @entity3 " ( 1948 ) one would think that a movie named " @entity3 " would include an actual @entity3 address			1
maybe director @entity48 was our nation 's first ironic hipster			2
either way , the film does deal with the politics of running for president and @entity62 apologizes to the woman he loves and to the @entity6 people through a radio address			1
" @entity42 " ( 1993 ) in the 1993 film , the @entity26 falls into a coma after an embarrassing incident			2
so @entity5 insiders scramble to look for someone who looks like him and keep up the charade			2
played by @entity73 , @entity42 is an average @entity74 -- honest and kind -- who wants to actually help people			2
but the political powers want him gone and accuse him of corruption			2
in the key scene , @entity42 faces a joint session of @entity34 and the @entity6 people to address the accusations			1
after that speech , he 's not the president anymore			2
" the @entity6 president " ( 1995 ) while many would 've thought the climatic speech in this @entity87 - directed film featured @entity89 as president speaking before the joint session of @entity34 , the most dramatic and most quotable part of the movie was when @entity89 , as president @entity94 , spoke to a packed @entity5 briefing room			1
@entity89 defends his relationship with @entity98 's character and in the process , talked about gun control and climate control			2
" @entity45 " -- season 2 , episode 13 ( 1999 ) played by @entity105 , @entity104 was the ideal president			0
his speeches were both passionate and pragmatic			0
in the episode " @entity111 , " he speaks before the @entity6 people while dealing with a hostage situation in @entity110			0
the entire episode was built around the speech			0
melodramatic walk - and - talks ? check			0
an @entity117 - induced speechwriting masterpiece ? well , almost			0
" @entity118 " ( 2000 ) @entity119 plays a shrewd president @entity120 and in the pivotal speech of this 2000 drama , he goes before @entity34 during the @entity3 address to speak out against sexism , challenging them to confirm the first female vice president			1
it 's a moving speech near the end of the movie , and you 'd be surprised how it turned out			0
" @entity131 " ( 2003 ) sure , many of us would love @entity134 as our president			0
in the 2003 comedy " @entity131 , " @entity134 runs for president and as expected , strikes a chord with the @entity6 people before hitting a few speed - bumps along the way			0
in the big scene , his character , @entity143 alderman @entity142 stops arguing with his opponent and instead speaks directly to the @entity6 people , touching on issues of foreign policy , crime , and even the pseudo-imperialism of @entity6 exceptionalism			0
but alas , while the setting looks like the chambers of @entity34 and the @entity3 , it 's not			1
" xxx : @entity3 " ( 2005 ) this 2005 movie starring rapper @entity156 is chock - filled with loud guns , loud hip - hop and really bad acting			1
but the actual @entity3 address does show up in this film , although it 's where terrorists kidnap the president			1
" commander - in - chief " -- season 1 , episode 1 ( 2005 ) we have had the first @entity171 president , the first @entity173 - @entity6 president and , yet , we still have n't had the first woman president			0
on the small screen , @entity175 played the part as president @entity178 in 2005			0
in the opening episode of this @entity181 drama , the first woman president goes before @entity34 and talks of hope and aspirations and of @entity6 being a force for good across the globe			0
" @entity3 " ( 2008 ) another head - fake			1
despite the title , there is no actual @entity3 here , either			1
just a series of sketches performed by the experienced comedian @entity192 , where she skewers @entity6 culture			0
watching this 2008 comedy series on @entity197 , though , was probably more fun than watching an actual @entity3			1
" w " ( 2008 ) of all the movies on the list , this one clearly feels the most surreal			1
an @entity202 creation , it 's hard to judge whether the movie is actually a biography of @entity205 as young collegian and as president			0
@entity208 does a fine job of portraying the 43rd president			0
in the film , @entity208 convinces the country to go to war with @entity214			0
interestingly , the speech that @entity208 gives in the movie is an actual speech given by @entity205 while persuading the country to go to war , with the song " @entity220 " in the background and actual footage of real audience reaction weaved into the movie .			0
