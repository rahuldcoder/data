@entity0 , @entity1 -- after 10 days of mourning and thousands of emotional eulogies and speeches , @entity1 finally buried its most famous son , @entity6 , on sunday at his rural village of @entity8 in the @entity9			1
speaking at the funeral , @entity11 , @entity6 's close comrade and a man he spent 26 of his 27 years in prison with , brought tears to the 4,500 assembled dignitaries and the nation when he concluded his eulogy : " when @entity21 [ @entity20 , another @entity22 trialist with whom the two were imprisoned ] died i lost a father			1
now i have lost a brother			0
my life is in a void and i do n't know who to turn to			0
" today the country blinks the tears away from its eyes and confronts its own void : @entity6 is gone , and what now ? @entity1 is a country adrift			1
despite the admirable peace and stability of the past 20 years , storm clouds are looming for the nation today led by president @entity38 , @entity6 's third successor			1
@entity6 's passing will not herald any shock new direction , but his funeral took place against the backdrop of massive political and economic disappointment , most powerfully demonstrated by the booing of @entity38 -- for traditional @entity47 an unprecedented break with culture -- at @entity6 's memorial service at the @entity51 on december 10			1
the spat over the apparent failure by government to make proper arrangements for @entity57 laureate archbishop @entity56 -- a fierce @entity38 critic -- to attend @entity6 's funeral added to perceptions that a small coterie of arrogant , out - of - touch leaders around @entity38 were at the helm of the country			1
in the same week , @entity65 published a notorious new secrecy law ( the @entity67 ) which will criminalize whistleblowers and journalists for exposing stories such as the spending of zar208 - million ( $ 20m ) of taxpayer funds on @entity38 's rural palace in his home village , @entity75			2
@entity38 ascended to power in 2009 with promises of jobs for the poor , but unemployment has stubbornly hovered at 25 %			0
about 52.8 % of young people under 34 are on the streets			0
the economy is in trouble , with growth forecasts cut again and again over the past four years			2
third quarter growth was an anaemic 0.7 % , and full - year gdp growth is forecast at 1.9 % by most economists , while the rest of @entity1 's peers such as @entity91 forge ahead at growth rates of about 5.6 %			1
perceptions of corruption are on the rise , says the non-governmental organization @entity96			0
the country slipped three places in @entity100 's corruption index this year to 72nd out of 177 countries			2
@entity102 , @entity6 's successor who was removed from the presidency by @entity38 in 2008 , said last week that there was increasing frustration among ordinary people about the direction the country was taking			1
" so when they look at some of the things that are happening ...			0
when they see this corruption in the country , which seems to be increasing at all levels of government , the people are aggrieved			0
they are saying but this is not what freedom was for , " he said			0
the 10 - day period of @entity6 's mourning amplified @entity102 's words			1
' fake interpreter ' scandal the now internationally notorious " fake interpreter " at @entity6 's memorial , for example , has extensive links with the ruling @entity127 : he is employed at a company owned by the party 's religious desk chief			1
the man is not proficient in sign language			0
he is also schizophrenic -- and he stood a meter from some of the world 's most powerful leaders , including @entity141 president @entity140			2
not a single person has been sanctioned for hiring him , seven days after the scandal broke			0
ordinary @entity1 inured to corruption told me last week that they have no doubt that his hiring was corruptly influenced			2
apart from shining a harsh new light on our current leaders ' failings , though , there is an added silver lining to @entity6 's death			1
members of the ruling @entity127 and society are now asking questions about the current crop of leaders ' ability to get @entity1 out of its current slump			1
as @entity6 was buried , the big political question is whether @entity38 's presidency -- wracked by scandal and presiding over a protest for services such as water and electricity every second day -- would survive after he was booed in front of the international media and more than 91 heads of states and dignitaries			2
@entity38 has a firm grip on his party 's machinery ( he was re-elected with 74 % of the votes at the party conference in december 2012 ) , but he is increasingly seen as a liability by party insiders			0
a snap poll by @entity1 's largest weekend newspaper , the @entity183 , published on the day of @entity6 's funeral , shows that 51 % of registered @entity127 voters believe @entity38 should resign following widespread coverage of the use of taxpayers money to build his rural palace			1
@entity1 's fifth democratic elections will be held in the next six months , and although analysts expect the @entity127 to win without much trouble , few expect the party to hold on to its huge majority			1
from its current 65.9 % the @entity127 's support could fall to less than 60 % according to one group			2
is @entity1 about to descend into racial conflagration because @entity6 is gone , though ? doomsayers have beaten this drum many times before in the past 19 years , even when @entity6 left government in 1999			1
it has not come to pass , and is a scenario that is unlikely			0
the real challenges for @entity1 today are poverty , inequality and unemployment			0
@entity38 's presidency has failed to implement necessary structural changes -- the @entity127 is in alliance with the powerful trade union federation @entity211 and kowtows to it on labour policy , leading to government paralysis -- to create jobs and economic growth			2
education is poor -- last year the government failed to deliver textbooks to some pupils for up to nine months			0
the young are ubiquitous on the streets and they are now being attracted in significant numbers by the young , former @entity127 radical @entity225 's breakaway party @entity224			2
it advocates @entity229 - style nationalization and land grabs			0
it is highly unlikely that these challenges will unseat @entity6 's @entity127 from power - yet			1
however , with @entity6 gone and the halo of the liberation era slowly slipping away , coupled with revulsion in many quarters of the rampant corruption and stasis of the current regime , a change is coming			0
for many here , that change will come with the 2019 national elections			0
in the meantime , @entity1 will have a noisy election in 2014 , remain on an unremarkable growth path and fail to live up to the promise it showed when @entity6 became president in 1994			1
it is a path that the unemployed young , standing at the fence outside the largesse enjoyed by their leaders , may one day want to tilt at unless something is done , urgently , to improve their lives .			0

after @entity6 's death , @entity1 is a country adrift , says *justice* @entity260
despite the peace and stability of the past 20 years , storm clouds are looming
spats over memorial , funeral led to *accusations* country 's leaders are out - of - touch
next election *planned* for 2014 ; @entity127 likely to retain power but may lose massive majority
