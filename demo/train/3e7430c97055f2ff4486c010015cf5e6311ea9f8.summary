@entity24 , editorial director of print and @entity27 books at @entity0 , said the list was created through taxing months of deliberation among her team , though no mathematical algorithms were used			1
" one of our tasks was to have books that do n't feel like homework : ' eat your vegetables ' books , " @entity32 said			2
" there was nothing in there except ' i loved this book when i was 12 for this reason			0
' we lobbied each other			0
" the books are not ranked but rather are listed alphabetically to represent that " no book is more important than another , " she added			2
some books that unanimously made the cut are children 's books like " @entity54 " by @entity55 and " unbroken , " a nonfiction book about @entity57 by " @entity59 " author @entity58			1
fan favorites like the first installments of the " @entity62 , " " @entity63 " and " @entity64 " series made the cut			0
the list also features just one of the no. 1 @entity69 , @entity72 's " @entity71			2
" " we tried to make sure that we had a pretty good balance of fiction and nonfiction , " @entity32 said			0
" in terms of the demographic of the writers , we never sat down and said ' we need more women ' or ' we need more books from different cultural groups or countries			0
' but overall , when i eyeball that list , it seems to have a lot of variation			0
" the book most hotly debated by the editorial team was @entity92 's dystopian novel " 1984			0
" " it was n't so much ' is " 1984 " a great book ? ' but ' should we put " 1984 " or " @entity95 " ? should we put " @entity64 " or " @entity98 " ? ' on a 100 book list , you probably ca n't put both , " @entity32 said			1
" we tried to find books that were iconic and that would lead to other books			0
" the list leaves off classics like " @entity105 " and " @entity106 , " though some editors argued for their inclusion			0
