-- @entity1 stands on a tower balcony in nighttime @entity3 , peering down at the dizzying lights hundreds of feet below			2
the distant rumble of city traffic rises up from the streets			0
a gust of wind brushes her hair			0
@entity1 smiles while swiveling her head in all directions to take in the view			0
" that was cool , " she said a few minutes later			0
" i want to go back to @entity3			0
" that 's because @entity1 was never physically in @entity3			0
the @entity17 , @entity18 , woman was 4,000 miles away in an @entity20 hotel lobby , wearing a headset and trying out a demonstration of new technology that can place people in exotic virtual settings almost anywhere on the planet			2
it 's all part of a new experiment by @entity30 , the global hotel chain , to let guests sample virtual destinations with the @entity33 , a headset whose high - definition , 3 - d display immerses wearers in a lifelike interactive world			1
" we really want to appeal to the next generation of travelers , " said @entity38 , director of global brand marketing for @entity30			1
virtual travel is in its infancy and a long way from being mainstream			1
but the travel industry is intrigued by its potential , which goes far beyond @entity49 or online " virtual tours " of hotels and resorts			1
the idea is not that virtual travel will replace real - world travel , because nobody in the industry would go for that			1
instead , the travel industry hopes that people who sample virtual snippets of alluring vacations -- say , rafting the @entity63 or hiking the @entity64 -- will be persuaded to splurge on the real thing			1
behind the @entity33 driving this trend are next - generation systems such as the @entity33 and @entity69 's @entity68 , which promise a leap forward in virtual - reality technology			1
the much - hyped @entity33 headset looks like something a skier or scuba diver might wear and fits snugly over the wearer 's face , paired with headphones			1
its crisp 3d display immerses you in an interactive world -- a medieval village or a tropical jungle -- which you sometimes can navigate with the help of a game controller			2
the goggles come packed with a 100 - degree field of view , extending beyond viewers ' peripheral vision			0
they have an accelerometer , gyroscope and compass to track the position of your head and sync the visuals to the direction where you are looking -- allowing @entity100 to improve on the sometimes jerky visuals of other virtual - reality systems			1
the @entity33 was designed to enhance video gaming			1
but @entity104 paid $ 2 billion for its maker , @entity105 , in march , seeing the device as a potential future communication platform			2
one developer for the @entity33 is excited about the technology 's long - term potential to tranform travel			1
" i could go for a run in the morning in some exotic beach and in the evening stroll the streets of some city ... i could be a virtual storm chaser close to a tornado and even travel deep in the ocean , " the developer wrote in an online forum			2
" in fact these experiences will be so real , without risk , and of course cheap that i might actually have second thoughts about traveling ... @entity125 without the cold ... jungles without the heat and bugs ... and people who will provide ( this ) content will make millions			0
" virtual journeying consumer versions of the @entity33 and @entity68 -- which works in much the same way -- are n't expected on the market until 2015 at the earliest			1
but that has n't stopped the travel industry from tinkering with prototypes			1
@entity138 , the international travel agency , announced a trial program in august that will allow customers at one of its stores in @entity145 to don @entity146 and experience a flight on one of its airplanes or tour a @entity152 resort			2
and @entity30 has been touring @entity154 cities this fall with its " @entity155 , " a booth that invites visitors to climb inside , strap on an @entity33 and take a virtual tour of @entity160 in @entity161 and @entity162 in @entity3			1
viewers watch a 90 - second video produced by @entity165 , the @entity167 creative studio that has done visual effects for " gravity " and other movies			0
to make the experiences feel more lifelike , fans in the booths blow soft breezes while misters recreate the feel of ocean spray			0
whether such virtual - reality glimpses inspire someone to take a real trip remains to be seen			2
but visitors to the booths on a recent weekday in @entity20 came away impressed			0
" that was truly amazing			0
it reminded me of something from ' @entity190 , ' " said @entity185 of @entity186 , @entity187			0
" @entity3 has always been a dream destination of mine			0
and just to get a feel for a place -- it was much more than i imagined			0

the travel industry is letting customers " sample " potential trips through virtual reality
guests wear headsets such as the @entity33 and are immersed in a virtual world
