@entity0 is unquestionably the world 's best golfer after a 2014 in which he soared to the top of the world rankings and charged to two major triumphs			1
the @entity7 's success has earned him legions of fans around the globe , so we asked our followers on social media to send us their questions for one of the world 's most famous athletes			1
and they did n't disappoint , quizzing @entity0 on everything from deadly animals to his beloved @entity21 ... @entity0 : " no you 're consciously thinking of your swing all the time			1
there 's a certain way i like to see myself swing the club , and i do a lot of technical work on the video with my coach @entity31 on off weeks and make sure that we 've got into the right positions for me			1
so constantly thinking of my swing and i 'm making sure it 's in the right place			1
" @entity0 : " i think i 'm most looking forward to playing @entity37 in the @entity38			1
there 's a lot of great events that are coming up , actually			2
i 've got the @entity38 at @entity42 , the @entity43 at @entity44			0
2015 is shaping up to be a pretty special year for golf			2
" have you played much in @entity47 ? when will he play in @entity47 ? @entity49 , @entity50 @entity0 : " i 've played a few times in @entity47			1
i 've played the @entity52 a couple of times			0
i played the @entity54 once			0
i played @entity55 for two days			0
i got sick and pulled out after two days			0
i 'd like to make it down again			0
it 's a beautiful part of the world and i really enjoyed my time down there , apart from getting sick at @entity55			1
but hopefully it wo n't be too long before i 'm back down there			0
" can you do better than @entity62 ? @entity0 , can you do better than @entity62 ? he was a hero in this game			1
@entity64 , @entity50 @entity0 : " it 's going to be a very difficult thing to do			1
fourteen majors , obviously , which is his benchmark			0
and 80 odd @entity70 tour wins and everything else that he 's accomplished			2
he 's had a phenomenal career			2
i 'll keep chipping away at it tournament by tournament and see how i go , but i think if you asked anyone if anyone had half of the career that @entity62 has -- has had so far -- they 'd be very , very happy			0
" did you ever encounter a dangerous animal on the course ? @entity85 @entity84 , @entity50 @entity0 : " yes , there 's been a few			1
where we play at the @entity91 , there 's a few alligators and snakes floating around			2
i 've come across a couple of black mambas down there ( in @entity47			0
) and there 's always a couple of snakes			2
and i think there was maybe a -- is it an adder ? a black otter , they 're pretty dangerous as well			0
there are alligators in @entity107 and stuff too			0
but that 's really been it			2
" @entity0 : " @entity110			1
it has to be @entity110 from back home and one of the best players that ever lived , i think			0
