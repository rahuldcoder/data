-- it is the much - anticipated book many in football have been waiting for , while others have feared its publication			0
@entity6 's autobiography offered the tantalizing prospect of lifting the lid on life as the manager of one of the world 's biggest football clubs -- @entity14			1
@entity6 retired after 27 years at @entity15 in may , giving him time to reflect on a career which has seen the @entity19 clash with the great and the good of world football			1
if you do n't have the time to sift through @entity6 's 400 - page memoir , do n't worry			1
@entity0 is here to help , with the 10 things you ca n't afford to miss from " @entity6 : my autobiography			1
" @entity6 on @entity29 : @entity6 and the @entity14 staff were impressed with @entity29 from a young age			1
" this was a man playing in under - age football , " the @entity33 's scouting reports told him when he was a schoolboy playing for rival club @entity34			0
@entity14 attempted to sign @entity29 at the ages of 14 and 16 , but on both occasions the young striker turned the @entity15 club down , with the forward 's commitment to @entity34 being such that the club was " in his blood , " according to @entity6			1
" a remarkable raw talent , " is how @entity6 describes the player he finally signed in 2004 , but he also labels @entity29 as " not the quickest learner			1
" @entity6 also did n't take kindly to @entity29 's suggestions as to which players @entity14 might sign			1
playmaker @entity53 is currently delighting @entity55 fans with his sparkling form			0
and according to @entity6 , the @entity57 was a player @entity29 thought @entity14 should have bought in 2010 , before he joined @entity59 from @entity60			1
@entity6 told @entity29 in no uncertain terms that it was " none of his business who we should have gone for			1
" @entity6 on @entity67 : @entity67 played for @entity14 between 1993 and 2005 , acting as @entity6 's general and captain out on the pitch			1
" he was the most influential presence in the dressing room in the time we worked together , " says @entity6			2
" @entity67 took a lot of the onus off me in making sure the dressing room was operating at a high level of motivation			0
" but @entity67 was fiercely critical of players who he deemed were n't committed to the @entity14 cause and as his relationship with the club fractured , it would be his undoing			1
the @entity84 lambasted some of the team 's younger players during an interview with @entity14 's @entity90 television channel			1
" the hardest part of his body is his tongue , " says @entity91			0
" he had the most savage tongue you can imagine			0
" @entity67 left @entity14 to sign for boyhood club @entity97 , where he played 10 games before retiring in june 2006			2
@entity6 on @entity100 : both @entity6 and @entity100 bowed out of football at the end of the 2012 - 13 season , with the former saying " he went out at @entity106 much as i did at @entity14 : on his own terms			1
" @entity100 left @entity14 to join @entity59 in 2003 and @entity6 details how the relationship between the two had deteriorated			1
after a 2 - 0 defeat to @entity55 in february 2003 , @entity6 kicked a boot which flew towards @entity100 and struck him just about his left eye			2
it marked @entity114 of @entity100 's @entity14 career			2
@entity6 suggests @entity100 became distracted by the media storm which follows him wherever he goes			2
" his eye was off the ball , " says @entity6			2
" a shame , because he could still have been at @entity14 when i left			2
" @entity6 does praise the former @entity123 captain 's tenacity and longevity , but wonders whether @entity100 might live to regret swapping @entity126 football for @entity127 and the @entity128 in 2007			1
" at some point in his life , he may feel the urge to say : i made a mistake			0
" ferguson on @entity135 / @entity134 affair : one of the great controversies of @entity6 's latter years at @entity14 is the racism row which erupted between @entity134 and @entity135 , of the club 's great rivals @entity138			1
@entity135 was hit with an eight - game ban in december 2011 for racially abusing @entity134 , with @entity6 highly critical of how then @entity138 manager @entity141 handled the affair			2
@entity135 refused to shake @entity134 's hand ahead of a match later on in the 2011 - 12 season , an act which drew @entity6 's ire			1
" a club of @entity138 's stature should have done something about that , but he played in the game all the same , " recalls @entity6			2
" i called @entity135 a ' disgrace to @entity138 ' and said they would be wise to ' get rid ' of him			0
" blog : can brain power improve footballers ? ferguson on @entity123 job : the passionate @entity19 reveals he was twice offered the chance to manage the @entity123 national team , in 1999 and 2001			1
but it was not a job he entertained accepting for one minute			0
" there was no way i could contemplate taking the @entity123 job , " he says			2
" can you imagine me doing that ? a scotsman ? " i always joked that i would take the position and relegate them : make them the 150th rated country in the world , with @entity175 149			0
" @entity6 on @entity176 : he is in no doubt that @entity176 was " the most gifted player i managed			2
" " he surpassed all the other great ones ( players ) i coached at @entity14			2
and i had many , " says @entity6 of the @entity182 star			0
@entity176 joined @entity59 for a then world record fee of Â £ 80 million pounds in 2009 , a transfer which @entity6 describes as " a clever move by them			1
" " it was a way for @entity189 , their president , to say to the world ' we are @entity59 , we are the biggest of the lot			0
' " it marked the end of a two - year pursuit of @entity176 by @entity59			0
@entity189 's predecessor as @entity59 president @entity197 made a bid to sign the explosive forward in 2008 which irked @entity6 , with the @entity33 telling @entity176 " i 'd rather shoot you than sell you to that guy now			2
" a year later , @entity176 was unveiled in the @entity204 capital			0
@entity6 on @entity205 : in 2009 and 2011 , @entity6 saw his @entity14 team lose to @entity205 in @entity208 finals			1
@entity205 's style of play was unrivaled in @entity6 's eyes and he describes the @entity213 team as " the best team ever to line up against my @entity14 sides			1
" @entity6 reserves special praise for @entity217 , the four - time @entity218 winner who was to become @entity205 's talisman			2
" the group of world - beaters who formed around @entity217 were formidable , " declares @entity6			0
" i felt no envy towards those great sides			0
regrets yes , when we lost to them , but jealousy , no. " @entity6 on @entity228 : @entity6 first announced his intention to retire in 2001 , saying he would sever all ties with @entity14 in may 2002			1
eventually he performed a u-turn and signed a new contract with the club and the rest , as they say , is history			0
but for a large part of the 2001 - 02 season , @entity14 's board were trying to identify a successor to @entity6			1
the man they had in mind , according to @entity6 , was then @entity123 manager @entity228			1
" the head - hunters were due to meet a candidate to succeed me the following week , " explains @entity6			0
" @entity228 was to be the new @entity14 manager , i believe ... i remember asking @entity246 one day : " @entity246 , what 's @entity228 got ? ' but @entity246 could shed no light			1
" @entity6 on @entity249 : when @entity249 was unveiled as @entity251 manager in 2004 , @entity6 suspected he could be a serious rival to @entity14 in the pursuit of major honors			1
" @entity249 was fresh in town , working for an employer with stacks of money , and with hype clearing his path , " @entity6 says of the manager who arrived at @entity251 after guiding an unfancied @entity256 team to @entity208 glory in 2004			2
" ( @entity251 ) were much better organized than before			0
i did n't win a game at @entity265 after @entity249 arrived			0
" @entity249 rejoined @entity251 earlier this year , after winning an @entity267 league , cup and @entity208 treble with @entity270 in 2010 and a @entity204 title with @entity59 in 2012			0

@entity6 felt the pain of a crushing defeat , but it was his wife @entity285 who was inconsolable			0
" @entity285 said , ' that was the worst day of my life			0
i ca n't take much more of this			0
' " i felt pretty ragged myself , but i could see the distress in my wife			0
' @entity285 , ' i began , ' we have a great life , and we 've had a fantastic period of success			0
' ' i know , ' she said			0
' but i 'm not going out			0
there are too many @entity272 fans in the village			0
' " @entity285 need not have worried			0
