@entity0 , @entity1 the days pass one after the other in @entity0 , @entity1 , without bringing any real answer about @entity5			1
for a year and half , @entity5 's family in this idyllic town has lived with the knowledge that the @entity11 militant group @entity10 is holding the 26 - year - old @entity13 aid worker			1
publicly , they kept silent about her plight , with her captors threatening to execute her if the family spoke out			2
but on friday , @entity10 claimed that @entity5 had been killed in a building that was hit during a @entity21 airstrike on @entity22 , the militants ' de facto capital in @entity25			1
" friday was a dark day , " said @entity26 , a longtime friend of the family			1
" punched a hole through you			0
" but @entity10 offered no proof to back up its claim , other than an image of a building in rubble			1
the @entity36 are holding out hope that she 's still alive , imploring the militant group to contact them			0
" we have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately , " her parents , @entity46 and @entity47 , said in a statement friday			0
" you told us that you treated @entity5 as your guest , " they said			1
" as your guest her safety and well - being remains your responsibility			0
" @entity21 is openly disputing @entity10 ' claim about @entity5 's fate			1
" what we know about this terrorist organization is that they are liars when it comes to these things , " said @entity21 government spokesman @entity55			1
he questioned the extremist group 's ability to identify @entity21 warplanes flying at high altitudes			1
but in @entity0 , @entity5 's family are staying out of the claims and counterclaims of what happened			1
" at this time , they just want contact through the original channels , " said @entity26			0
" this is such a fluid situation , going hour to hour , " he told @entity2			2
some observers have questioned why no militants died in the collapsed building , and why , if the building had just been struck , there was no smoke from smoldering debris			2
but others say they fear @entity10 may have killed her previously and been waiting for an opportunity to announce the death			1
@entity21 says it believes the militants killed one of its fighter pilots weeks before they released a video of him being burned to death			1
@entity10 has made a big show of its barbaric killings of international hostages , including three @entity13 , two @entity95 and two @entity97 citizens			1
the militants had threatened to kill @entity5 last summer			1
they set a deadline of august 13 , for a ransom of nearly $ 7 million to be paid to prevent her execution , according to a source close to the family			2
@entity13 officials are investigating the theory that she may have died weeks or months ago and that @entity10 was possibly ashamed to announce that they had killed a woman			1
but retired @entity110 lt. col. @entity109 says it 's plausible a hostage may have been inadvertently killed in @entity25			2
" we all know that intelligence ... in @entity25 is not as good as we have in @entity115 now , " @entity109 said			0
" so it is plausible , and it could be unfortunate			0
but sometimes ... that happens in these wars			0
" like some of the other @entity10 hostages , @entity5 went to the @entity122 to help the flood of refugees affected by @entity25 's grinding civil war			1
since her teenage years , she had thrown herself into international causes			0
in high school , her local paper showed her marching through town as part of the @entity132 coalition , lobbying members of @entity134 and staging silent protests against the genocide in western @entity137			0
as a student at @entity139 , @entity5 was president of a group called stand , a student - led movement to end mass atrocities			2
after graduating , she joined aid agencies that took her to @entity146 , @entity147 and the @entity149 territories			0
she came home briefly in 2011 , volunteering at a women 's shelter and an @entity153 clinic			0
but she could n't ignore the unfolding crisis in @entity25			0
" i am in solidarity with the @entity25 people			0
i reject the brutality and killing that the @entity25 authorities are committing against the @entity25 people , " she said in a video posted online			0
in 2012 , @entity5 went to @entity25 with the @entity160 and @entity162 humanitarian agency			2
she fell into the hands of hostage takers in august 2013 in @entity165 , @entity25 , her family said , after leaving a @entity168 hospital			0
her family heard nothing until 10 months later , when @entity10 got in touch with its ransom demand			1
" you have no control			0
you have to abide by the rules , " @entity26 said of the situation			0
" it was a living hell , and it has been a living hell for the family , and it is today			1
" @entity2 's @entity178 contributed from @entity0 , and @entity179 wrote from @entity180			2
@entity2 's @entity181 and @entity182 contributed to this report .			2

" it has been a living hell , " a longtime friend of the family tells @entity2
@entity10 claims @entity5 , an @entity13 woman , was killed in a @entity21 airstrike
her family asks the militants , who previously demanded a ransom , to get in touch
