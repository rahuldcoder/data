@entity0 -- former @entity3 ceo @entity2 has hit back at @entity5 lawmakers who suggested he misled them over concerns voiced by the country 's financial regulators			1
@entity1 can also reveal that those very same regulators will now be called to testify next week alongside a key @entity3 executive , who @entity2 said had mistakenly told traders to lower their submissions to the @entity13			1
@entity14 , chairman of the @entity16 watchdog , has been been called to the @entity17 monday afternoon with the head of the @entity16 's bank supervisory body @entity19 , the man famous for warning @entity3 of failings in its culture			1
@entity14 and @entity19 will appear after panel members take a pre-arranged briefing from the @entity26 governor @entity25			2
@entity27 is slated to present the central bank 's quarterly update on the @entity5 economy and interest rates			1
however , sources say the discussions are likely to focus heavily on the issue of @entity35 after @entity25 's deputy @entity36 refuted suggestions he leaned on @entity3 to lower its rate submissions			1
@entity39 , former barclays chief operating officer , will also give evidence monday , in what is likely to be the most keenly watched testimony of all			2
@entity2 's right - hand man also quit last week after the bank was fined a record Â £ 290 million ( us $ 449 million ) for fixing the interest rate floor upon which trillions of dollars worth of financial contracts are based			1
diamond gives up $ 31 million bonuses @entity39 will come in for questioning about claims he misread an email from @entity2 asking him to lower @entity35 submissions following a conversation between @entity2 and @entity36			1
questions also remain about whether or not @entity2 was aware of correspondence between the @entity16 and @entity3 about the bank 's alleged use of financial structures " at the aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules			1
" at the time of writing , four out of the 13 lawmakers on the committee charged with investigating the libor scandal said they would like to see @entity2 be recalled to clarify his earlier statements			2
inside @entity3 : morale at all time low in a letter obtained by @entity1 from @entity2 to @entity5 @entity17 chairman @entity73 dated july 10 , the 60 - year - old @entity71 - born banker seemed keen to get a second chance to speak			1
@entity2 said the comments made at the hearing had had " a terribly unfair impact " upon his reputation , a reputation which @entity2 said was " of paramount concern to me			1
" he added : ' i look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so			0
" yet those close to the parliamentary body say it is unlikely @entity2 will have a second chance to put on a polished appearance because the committee is due to be reshuffled next week			2
" it 's not the complexities of this that are the problem			0
it 's the evidence that 's the problem , " said one unnamed member			0
" also time is working against us			0
" another doubted @entity2 would become embroiled in the @entity99 's recently launched @entity35 probe , even if sources at @entity3 confirmed to @entity1 they are bound by @entity2 's contract to cover his legal costs , should he face any			1
all the while diamond has waived his right to Â £ 20 million ( us $ 31 million ) in deferred compensation and bonus payments , walking away instead with a tenth of that amount			1
@entity109 mp , a lawmaker and member of the committee that interrogated diamond last week , said : " you only give up your job and your pay if you 've got no cards to play			0
" this has never been how @entity2 has ever operated			2
" @entity119 's letter to @entity17 chairman @entity73 july 10 , 2012 dear mr @entity73 , having watched the @entity17 's session today i was dismayed that you and some of your fellow @entity17 members appear to have suggested that i was less than candid with the @entity17 last week			0
any such suggestion would be totally unfair and unfounded			0
the focus of your concern appears to relate to correspondence between @entity130			0
@entity14 and @entity131 in april 2012			2
the questions asked of me , however , concerned the period of promotion in september 2010 and the board meeting i attended in february 2012			0
as the letters of april 2012 make clear , those letters followed an april meeting between @entity130			0
@entity14 and @entity131 , which i did not attend			2
i was not asked about the april 2012 meeting nor was i asked about , nor shown , the follow up letter to that april meeting at our session			0
i trust this addresses any concerns you may have had			0
the comments made at today 's hearing have had a terribly unfair impact upon my reputation , which is of paramount concern to me			1
i look forward to discussing this issue with you further if you wish to do so			0
yours sincerely , @entity156 ( signature )			0
