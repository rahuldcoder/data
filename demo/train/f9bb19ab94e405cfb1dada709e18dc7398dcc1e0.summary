-- " you press the button , we do the rest			2
" so @entity5 promised back in 1888 when founder @entity6 introduced the company 's first camera			1
but that 's the problem , is n't it ? we do n't need anybody to do " the rest " nowadays			1
we do n't need film processing			1
we do n't need film , for that matter			1
we do n't even need the cameras			1
we can just pull out our phones and get a perfectly adequate snapshot -- one without the sharpness and detail of a good 35 - millimeter image , perhaps , but we live in an age of " good enough			2
" after all , those mp3 files on your @entity25 are no match for @entity29 quality , either			2
it 's that age of convenience that @entity6 helped usher in with his once - ubiquitous company			1
but now convenience and technology have taken their toll : on thursday , the venerable @entity39 , @entity38 - based firm filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy			1
these days , its most coveted assets are its patents for digital imaging -- including , ironically , some used in smartphones			0
" it made photography commonplace , from the @entity51 ( camera ) through its many variations , " says @entity46 , who teaches visual and cultural studies at the @entity48			1
the " democratization " of photography even helped turn the form into art , as experts sought to bracket off the snapshots of everyday amateurs from the aspiring work of aficionados , she adds			1
@entity63 : @entity65 collection looks back at midcentury @entity66 @entity5 was a pioneer in other ways			1
it was a relentless advertiser , promoting its products in a range of ways , making " @entity5 " a synonym for photography			1
@entity6 " was marketing a product and a process			0
that was his genius , " says @entity76			0
" it was bigger than just saying , ' hey , buy my brand			0
' it was ' invest in this way of doing things			0
' " @entity5 's advertising deliberately tapped into a powerful vein of nostalgia , a concept that became as ingrained as the silver - halide crystals that form the photographic image			1
@entity5 shrewdly exploited that feeling with its ad campaigns , which used songs such as the @entity93 - sung " the @entity92 " to yank consumers ' heartstrings			1
an episode of " @entity99 " paid homage to @entity5 's power , as ' 60s adman @entity102 pumped up the company 's carousel slide projector by pointing out , " this device is n't a spaceship			1
it 's a time machine			0
" a forward - looking firm unfortunately for @entity5 , nostalgia does not boost stock prices			1
companies are n't forever , even ones that people think of fondly			1
@entity112 used to define the @entity113 ; now the name refers to a struggling tv series that wishes to invoke the @entity113			0
@entity116 was once a common presence on @entity66 's @entity118 ; now it has been superseded by @entity119 and @entity120 , and its only remnant is the footwear store a subsidiary created in 1974 : @entity124			0
and @entity5 ? @entity125 wrote a song , " @entity65 , " using film 's rich colors as a metaphor for memory -- nostalgia , again			1
@entity132 : @entity5 moments remembered by the 1970s , @entity5 was responsible for 90 % of film and 85 % of camera sales in the @entity66 , according to @entity136			1
but for almost a generation , the company strained to keep up in a rapidly evolving tech market that 's a step removed from the chemicals - and - paper space it dominated			2
instead of @entity142 and @entity143 ( another firm that has been trying to reinvent itself ) , its rivals became @entity145 and @entity146 and @entity147			0
despite its tech know - how , @entity5 was n't quite nimble enough to keep up			1
its executives " suffered from a mentality of perfect products , rather than the high - tech mindset of make it , launch it , fix it , " @entity150 's @entity149 told @entity136			0
still , as the company seeks to reorganize , it 's worth remembering how much of a forward - looking firm @entity5 was			1
@entity6 , a former insurance company messenger boy and bank clerk , was inspired to go into the business after a trip to the @entity164			2
as his biography on the @entity5 website observes , " the camera was as big as a microwave oven and needed a heavy tripod			1
... there were chemicals , glass tanks , a heavy plate holder , and a jug of water			0
the complete outfit ' was a pack - horse load , ' as ( @entity6 ) described it			0
" photography was ripe for change			2
it was n't a mass business yet , as @entity182 writes in an excellent @entity184 essay about " the triumph of @entity186			2
" when the first @entity5 camera was introduced , the average middle - class family may have owned 10 photographs -- total			1
photography was a craft generally handled by professionals who knew how to deal with those giant cameras , fragile glass plates , careful exposure times and dangerous chemicals			1
he made photography casual : the early @entity5 cameras -- which cost $ 25 , a sizable sum at the time -- were loaded with 100 exposures , and the later @entity51 , which cost $ 1 , allowed for easy reloading			1
he anticipated the growth of leisure time , and made his product central to its use			2
" snapshots were a kind of social media : they were designed to be shared in once - ubiquitous albums of yesteryear , " @entity182 writes			0
years later , the vacation slide show , an excuse for gathering the neighbors to witness your trip to @entity220 , became the butt of jokes for the same reason			0
@entity6 was also a benevolent mogul , giving his employees medical care , paying them good wages and supporting high culture in his western @entity38 community			0
his name is all over the area , on such institutions as the @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 , the latter a photography museum			2
the digital present almost 3,000 miles away , there 's another monument to @entity5 : @entity241 's @entity240 , home of the @entity243			1
but even in the movie capital , the use of film is in decline			0
movie houses are changing over to digital projection , and even big - name directors such as @entity251 and @entity252 have shot their features in high - definition digital formats			0
amateurs , of course , have been indulging in digital for years			0
processing film takes money and -- perhaps more importantly -- time			0
now everything can be transferred from a camera to a computer as quickly as popping in a usb drive			0
anticipation is as long gone from the process as @entity267 booths			0
" my kids ' relationship to photography is completely different , " says @entity76			2
" they think you take pictures with a phone			0
" and prints ? almost never			0
indeed , there 's an impermanence to it all now			0
as one commenter to the @entity184 story pointed out , " the pictures last , even if the cameras did n't : i have family photographs from the 19th century			2
i ( wonder ) if , in 100 years , people will have the digital images from the late 20th ? ' oh , yeah , they were on that computer that died and we never got the files off of it			0
' " still , @entity5 's not dead yet			1
there 's the intellectual property , for starters ; analysts believe the patents may be worth $ 3 billion , according to @entity297 , more than the company itself			2
there 's the name , which is instantly recognizable			0
and there are the people : even though the company has cut thousands of jobs , much of its generally well - educated workforce has stayed in the area , many starting tech - related businesses			2
psychologically , @entity39 is taking the company 's bankruptcy pretty hard , says @entity76 , but the community is also hopeful			1
an editorial in the @entity313 suggests that the city 's economic climate is improving , and @entity76 points out that " we never had a real - estate bubble , so it never burst			0
" but it 's difficult , she adds , not to feel sad about the bankruptcy of a legendary name			2
" it feels like it marks the end of a major era , even though it 's easier to take photos now			0
the idea of democratization is everywhere , " she says			0
" but this bankruptcy strikes a nerve for a lot of people			2
it 's farewell to a certain version of the past , and with that is this idea of nostalgia and what @entity5 so successfully sold to the @entity66 public			1

@entity5 , *longtime* photography giant , filed for bankruptcy thursday
company made photography commonplace , which helped lead to its demise
@entity348 has taken over ; @entity5 has n't been able to compete
@entity344 was pioneer in advertising , particularly in evoking nostalgia
