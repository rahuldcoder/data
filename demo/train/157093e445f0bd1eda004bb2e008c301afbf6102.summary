-- every college applicant knows about the " hardship essay , " which asks a teenager to write about overcoming an obstacle			1
here 's a suggested approach : " being a high school senior unnerved by college applications was tough enough until i tried to fill out the @entity9 and the site froze , then refused to accept my writing and rejected my teachers ' recommendations			1
college application season turned into a nightmare this month as the @entity9 site crashed just as hundreds of thousands of early applicants got to work			1
this debacle could have been avoided			2
more important , it underscores the problems of using a single site to apply to a dozen or more colleges			1
the @entity9 , which started in 1975 , has been a great tool for students who want to apply efficiently to several colleges			1
but like everything on the high end of college admissions , it 's gotten way out of hand			1
and now the great crash of ' 13			0
guidance counselors talked of students almost in tears			2
tech - savvy parents said they jumped in to struggle with clickable images that could n't be clicked , uploads that would n't upload and paragraph breaks that were broken			2
the nonprofit @entity9 organization , which serves more than 500 colleges , blames the problems on a software upgrade ( maybe created by the same folks who gave us the software for @entity48 's new health insurance ? )			1
this excuse , in a business that revolves around unforgiving deadlines , is akin to high school kids stating that the dog ate their homework			0
surely the @entity9 executives tested this software ? surely they knew they were dealing with stressed - out students who get nervous when the system simply slows down a bit ? the @entity9 gurus did n't do themselves any favors with their tweets in the past few days : -- " aware some users are experiencing problems with the @entity66 previews			1
" ( duh , as many students would say			2
) -- " we are aware of the login issues users are experiencing			0
taking steps to address the problem as quickly as possible			0
" ( thanks for this october 14 message , but some campuses had october 15 deadlines for early apps			0
) -- " we 've implemented changes to clarify processes surrounding print preview ... " ( please use @entity80 to put this in @entity82			0
) as someone who taught high school @entity82 , then spent years coaching applicants , i ca n't believe that sentence comes from one of the most prominent organizations in higher ed. i drill my students to write clearly			2
implemented changes to clarify processes ? i grade that " @entity94 " @entity97 , the @entity98 at @entity99 and several other colleges with october 15 deadlines gave students an extra week , and those with november 1 deadlines are talking about extending them , too			1
others are trying an alternative , the @entity107			0
applicants pass around tips : you can upload better from a @entity111 than a pc			0
you can insert paragraph breaks into an essay , but it takes several steps			0
while researching " acceptance , " a book about a wonderful guidance counselor named @entity121 ( or @entity122 ) , i saw plenty of unnecessary angst in the college process			1
in too many communities , someone seems to have decided there are 40 or so acceptable campuses			0
going anywhere else is seen as losing the education lottery			0
@entity122 , who now works as an independent consultant for applicants , says last week he had a student who was determined to apply to 23 schools			0
@entity122 told the student that was too many , but the parents overruled him			2
besides ensuring this student will have to write more than 30 or 40 essays , that means nearly $ 2,000 in application fees			2
and for the past few weeks , even those students who did their work ahead of time have been encountering one problem after another			1
" kids are overwhelmingly stressed to begin with , and finding a common app that wo n't accept their essays is devastating , " @entity122 told me in between his appointments with frustrated high school seniors on @entity151 , @entity152			1
he was surprised last month when he attended an admissions conference in @entity157 and heard that the @entity9 folks conceded their program could n't count words in essays that were uploaded			0
" an essay has to be a cut - and - paste to have a word count ? " @entity122 said			0
" i find that hard to believe in 2013			0
" there might be an upside to this storm			0
it 's forcing parents and students to have a conversation about the pressure to get into the " right " college , and even the more basic pressure to get into college			1
for several years , i 've given speeches at high schools , churches and synagogues			0
( here 's a sign of the stress in the @entity185 : i was even asked to speak at an elementary school			0
) i urge 12th - graders to consider a gap year , combining working , going to community college and doing public service			1
grow up , i say , and take a year to find your passions and to give back to the taxpayers who have done a lot for you			2
parents in high - pressure communities usually dismiss that idea			2
i 'm secretly hoping for more delays with the @entity9 if kids ca n't apply to college now , they ca n't go next year			1
and that means they 'll be forced to take a gap year , which likely will be the best preparation for college of which anyone can dream			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity211 : the common app site crashed , leaving students and parents *frantic*
he says the group , which serves about 500 colleges , blames a software upgrade
he says application process is out of hand ; students too stressed about college
@entity209 : this is a good time for seniors to consider a " gap year " before college
