" but the consequences are not clear			0
" while authorities have not said what will become of the @entity1 weapons , the @entity3 crew may finally be heading home			1

that ship , the @entity65 , could also be returned to @entity3 after repairs are made			0
according to the @entity8 statement , the crew rendered the ship inoperable during the struggle to keep customs authorities from boarding it			0
