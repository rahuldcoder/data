-- @entity1 is the embodiment of the @entity2 -- and what is increasingly a @entity5 dream			0
originally from @entity6 in eastern @entity7 , he moved to @entity8 as a teenager			0
after earning degrees from @entity12 universities -- @entity13 and @entity14 -- he secured a comfortable job in a bucolic town in @entity17			0
now he is helping others in @entity7 follow his path , where the desire for elite @entity22 education is alive and well			1
in the last decade , mainland @entity5 have reshaped the international student body at @entity22 colleges and universities , notably at @entity12 institutions			1
in the 2009 - 2010 academic year , @entity7 surpassed traditional " study abroad " heavyweights like @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , to lead international enrollment across @entity22 higher education , according to the @entity34			1
the @entity22 - based institute 's most recent figures reveal that mainland @entity5 students increased 23 % to more than 723,000 in the 2010 - 11 academic year			1
a rising generation of affluent students while @entity5 students traditionally went abroad when they failed to secure a place at a top - tier local university , the best students are now forgoing elite @entity5 universities to study in the @entity22 , according to @entity1 , now academic director of @entity47 , an admissions consultancy in @entity48			1
many @entity5 are seeking a higher quality of education that will train them to become independent and creative , he said , and they see the world 's top - ranked universities are in the @entity22			1
@entity7 's economic reforms and " opening - up " that began in 1978 under @entity57 gave rise to the first major generation of students , who were generally reliant on scholarships to study in the @entity22 , according to @entity62 , an assistant professor at the @entity64 's @entity63			2
coinciding with @entity7 's rapid economic growth , a distinctive second generation emerged in the mid- 1990s comprising much more affluent students , @entity62 said			0
" there is a great increase in the phenomenon because ( mainland @entity5 ) do n't rely on scholarships anymore			2
" starting early at boarding schools the factors driving mainland @entity5 to study in the @entity22 come into play much earlier , @entity1 said , noting an influx of foreign @entity5 students into private @entity22 secondary schools , starting around 2005			1
@entity5 parents send their children to private @entity22 high schools as a " strategic decision " to strengthen their candidacy for elite @entity22 universities , @entity1 said			1
a growing number also want their children to lead happier lives rather than have them consumed by preparing for the " gaokao " in @entity7 -- the one - time , high - stakes national university entrance examination that is the sole determinant of admission			0
" the goal of education in mainland @entity7 is to prepare you to take the gaokao			0
in @entity7 , you would put the gaokao in the center ... whereas ... in @entity22 education , you put the student in the center , and everything else serves the best interests of the student			2
it 's not exclusively about ( getting into ) college			0
" while @entity22 boarding schools desire @entity5 students both for their dollars and diversity , they walk a " very fine line ... when it comes to recruiting @entity5 students , " said @entity1 , who assisted with admissions during his tenure teaching at @entity17 's @entity112			1
boarding schools typically admit four to five students of any foreign nationality per grade level , with international students comprising up to 20 % of the overall student body , @entity1 said			1
with about 100 students for each of the four grade levels , this means admitting a maximum of 20 mainland chinese , or five percent of the student body			0
" a school could easily fill itself with all @entity5 students , but no school 's going to do that ... it 's a double - edged sword -- if you have too many @entity5 , then the @entity5 will stop coming to your school , and also , @entity22 will stop coming to your school			1
" driving international enrollment at @entity22 universities by virtue of their size , @entity22 universities can accept a much higher number of @entity5 students than boarding schools			1
since 1999 , @entity7 was the second leading place of origin for international students at @entity140 , trailing only @entity29			0
its student numbers steadily increased to lead @entity140 's international enrollment since the last academic year , with 686 students currently enrolled ( nearly 16 % of the international student body			1
) @entity7 similarly dominates international enrollment at other @entity12 schools , including @entity147 and @entity148			1
" international students are seen very favorably as whole , as a way to diversify and really become a global institution , " said @entity149 , a lecturer at @entity151 's @entity150 and a specialist in higher education admissions policy			2
" also economically -- it 's very advantageous for elite schools to admit international students because the bulk of them can pay full tuition , " she added			0
as such , there is " a lot of favoritism " toward such students , as financial aid budgets have been cut over the last decade , she said			0
limits to international enrollment at @entity22 universities but while mainland @entity5 students dominate international enrollment , they comprise a small fraction of the overall student body			1
this is even more the case at the undergraduate level , as most international students are graduates			0
@entity140 has " no quotas or limits for international students , " according to @entity140 spokesperson @entity176			0
" all students are considered in the same pool for all places in the incoming class , regardless of citizenship or the school they attend			0
" @entity186 said she has not come across evidence of undergraduate quotas for international students but found it was standard practice for top - ranked schools to assess them as a separate pool rather than with the entire pool of applicants			0
some @entity22 colleges and universities aim to recruit an undergraduate cohort with around 10 % international students , according to @entity200 , founder of the @entity203 - based @entity202 consultancy , adding that the percentage depends on the strength of the applicant pool			2
bringing @entity22 education to @entity7 as @entity22 campuses can not fully support the demand from @entity7 , @entity1 sees an opportunity in bringing international education to @entity7 , beginning at the secondary level			1
the trend can already be seen in @entity22 universities establishing local degree - granting branches			0
next september , @entity216 will welcome its first undergraduate cohort at its new @entity219 campus			0
" instead of sending @entity5 students to secondary schools in @entity22 or other foreign countries , we want to bring international curriculum into @entity7 so they do n't need to travel outside the country , " @entity1 said			1
he helps local high schools incorporate international systems , such as the @entity228 and a-levels , alongside @entity5 curriculum			2
students at these " @entity5 versions of international schools " are typically @entity5 nationals , who are restricted by government policy from attending full - fledged international schools , which cater to expatriates			2
" my dream is to see international schools in @entity7 accessible to @entity5 citizens and other nationalities together in the same school , " @entity1 said			2
" that 's the future			0
