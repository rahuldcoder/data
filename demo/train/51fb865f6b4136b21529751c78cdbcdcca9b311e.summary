-- a man serving eight years for vehicular homicide because of a fatal crash involving his @entity4 is hoping for exoneration amid concerns over unintended acceleration in some of @entity4 's vehicles			1
@entity9 has always maintained his innocence in the 2006 crash			1
then 29 years old , he was driving home from sunday services with his pregnant wife , father , daughter , brother and niece in his 1996 @entity4			1
@entity9 told investigators that he pumped the brakes as he exited i - 94 in @entity22 , @entity23 , and approached an intersection , his lawyer , @entity19 , said			1
but @entity26 prosecutors claimed @entity9 had his foot on the gas as he approached cars waiting at a red light			2
the car was moving at between 70 and 90 mph when it struck two other vehicles			2
@entity33 , 33 , and his 10 - year - old son , @entity34 , were killed instantly			1
another passenger , 6 - year - old @entity35 , was left paraplegic			1
she testified in a wheelchair at @entity9 's trial and later died from her injuries			1
two mechanical engineers examined the car before trial on behalf of the state and the defense , @entity26 attorney @entity40 said			2
both concluded the brakes were operating and there were no problems with the acceleration , she said			0
although the throttle was found set open at 15 percent , which is unusual , the abnormality was attributed at the time to damage from the crash , she said			0
" bottom line , two experts -- one for each side -- said there was nothing wrong with the car , " she said			2
a jury convicted @entity9 of criminal vehicular homicide and he was sentenced to eight years in prison			1
but he continues to maintain his innocence			0
" i know that lives were lost that day , but i did everything within my power to try to stop that vehicle , " @entity9 said in a recent prison interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity66			1
" i never intended for this to happen			0
" the 1996 @entity4 is not a part of @entity4 's recall			1
relatives of the victims , who asked the judge to give him the maximum sentence , now support him , said @entity79 , a @entity80 lawyer who is preparing a lawsuit against @entity4 on the family 's behalf			2
" i am passionate about getting him out and suing @entity4 , " @entity79 told @entity0			2
he said the family feels " betrayed " by the evidence that led to @entity9 's conviction			1
" it was all smoke and mirrors , " @entity79 said			0
" i hope to get to the bottom of it and find the truth , " @entity89 , who survived the crash but lost his son , told @entity66			0
" i feel that the boy [ @entity9 ] is innocent			2
" @entity9 's accident is among the first of a growing number of cases getting a second look since @entity4 announced a recall , acknowledging that problems with sudden acceleration were more extensive than originally thought			1
in testimony last week before @entity107 , company executives apologized for underestimating the problem			0
complete coverage of the @entity4 recall a search of the @entity113 's online complaint database revealed 526 incidents listed for the 1996 @entity4			1
among the complaints concerning air bags , tires , steering and visibility were at least two dozen related to " vehicle speed control , " some dating back to 1997			0
" the contact states that while driving at 65 mph when placing her foot on the brake and slowing down , the vehicle accelerated on its own , " an october 17 , 2009 , report states			0
" by putting extreme pressure on the brake , she was able to pull over and turned off vehicle			0
" in a july 26 , 2003 , incident , a 1996 @entity4 waiting at a red light lurched forward into oncoming traffic , where it was struck by a car and a motorcycle			1
the complaint states that the motorcyclist died five years later of injuries caused by the accident			0
" with @entity4 in the news , found reports of other 1996 @entity4 's [ sic ] with sudden acceleration so filed this complaint , " the incident summary states			1
not all the entries for " vehicle speed control " complain of sudden acceleration			0
" on several occasions the vehicle failed to respond when the accelerator was depressed , " a february 25 , 1998 complaint says			0
@entity4 recalled more than 8 million vehicles , prompting @entity9 's attorney to seek a re-examination of the vehicle in the 2006 accident			1
" this never seemed right			0
a man with his family in the car -- his pregnant wife -- goes on a suicide mission ? then , the recalls started , and the complaints sounded just like what happened to mr. @entity9 , " lawyer @entity19 said			2
" it sounds just like a case of unintended acceleration			1
" @entity19 says he has filed paperwork with the court stating his intention to retest the car , which remains in a vehicle impound			2
" we plan to employ experts familiar with the ' @entity176 and the components that make up car to show that rapid acceleration is to blame for the accident , not mr. @entity9 accidentally stepping on the accelerator , " he said			1
@entity40 said her office is willing to cooperate with the examination and see where the results lead			0
" we have no interest in an innocent man being behind bars			0
accordingly , we are very open to considering evidence that might show that in fact he was n't guilty , " @entity40 said			0
" if we 're going to disturb a conviction we need evidence			0
" @entity0 's @entity193 contributed to this story .			0
