@entity0 , @entity1 -- sitting on a corner of her brown sofa in a modest rental apartment , @entity3 creates hand - made jewelry -- not quite the image you might expect from a public face in the nation 's bitter fight over health care reform			1
what the health care ruling means to you in the months leading up to thursday 's @entity18 ruling about the @entity20 - backed @entity19 , @entity3 's photo went viral across the political blogosphere , accompanied by the provocative headline " i am @entity23			1
" the high court ruled that the law 's individual mandate -- the provision requiring all @entity28 to have health insurance -- will stand			1
@entity3 called the ruling " historic , " " amazing " and " the right direction			2
" " i have to admit i was worried because ... i thought they were going to strike down part of it , especially the individual mandate , " @entity3 said			2
read the ruling ( pdf )			0
the ruling is good news for millions of @entity28 like @entity3 who have a pre-existing health condition			1
between 50 million and 129 million of them are younger than 65 , according to the @entity43			0
last fall , @entity3 , 35 , who is neither a politician nor a political operative , got noticed by grabbing a simple piece of paper and a blue @entity47 , and without even planning what to say , wrote , " i discovered my uterus was full of tumors			1
i could n't pay for surgery and because it was now a ' pre-existing condition ' insurance companies could ( and did ! ) turn me down for coverage			1
" the letter went on to praise the president @entity58 - supported pre-existing insurance plan for paying for most of her surgery			1
she set the timer on her small , red point - and - shoot camera and snapped a picture of herself holding the note and posted the photo on her blog www.giveneyestosee.com -- a site she 's operated since 2001			2
her photo has " been all over the @entity69 ; that 's crazy to me , " said @entity3 , who prefers to be identified by her first initial only : @entity73 it has been shared , praised , criticized , discussed , debated , dissected and dismissed on a wide swath of political forums both well - known and not - so - well - known , including @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , the @entity82 and the voices in @entity84			1
the praise has convinced her that she 's had a hand in turning the very meaning of the word @entity23 on its ear			2
first used as a weapon by @entity58 opponents , the word has more recently been embraced by supporters of the president 's plan			0
@entity97 presidential hopeful @entity96 said thursday , " @entity23 was bad policy yesterday , and it 's bad policy today			2
@entity23 was bad law yesterday , and it 's bad law today			2
" the ruling has prompted the @entity104 to launch a site called @entity106			0
for @entity3 , her personal campaign has made her a bit of a target			2
" her hand written letter says nothing of her having the freedom to get the service and pay out of pocket , at possibly an outrageous cost , but get the life - saving service none - the-less , " writes @entity118 , at @entity80			0
" nor does it mention the fact that she could have asked for a self - pay discount and then worked out a payment schedule that she could handle			0
no , because of the culture we have grown up in , it is her right to receive this service and it is clearly someone else 's responsibility to pay for it			0
" in 2014 , the law will prevent insurance companies from discriminating or denying coverage because of a pre-existing condition , says @entity2 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity136			1
for now , the law offers the federal @entity137 , which allowed @entity3 to have her surgery			2
@entity139 , a health policy expert at the @entity141 think tank , said the new regulations threaten to make the nation 's health care problems worse and destabilize the market			0
" @entity23 's radical changes to health insurance regulation were never necessary for expanding coverage for already sick patients " because of the 1996 @entity151 ( @entity151 ) -- which limits how employer health care plans can exclude benefits based on pre-existing conditions			1
@entity3 understands going without insurance was a gamble , but like many @entity28 she struggles to pay her $ 237 monthly premium for the pre-existing coverage			1
" it 's not that i did n't want health insurance this whole time , " she says			1
" it 's just a lot of money , and it 's hard to come up with the money every month			0
" she laughs when she remembers sitting down last october to post her @entity23 photo online from her bedroom computer amid her collection of stuffed animals and small @entity172 figurines			1
timeline of the health care law " i never thought a simple picture on my humble little blog would be all over the @entity69 , go viral , " said @entity3 , who shares her home with her fiance and two cats			1
" ( it ) would shut down my website three times a month because of the traffic			0
it was insane , " @entity3 laughed			0
" one person said ' you 're a hero ' -- which made me blush because i did n't think i was a hero			0
" as a part - time national customer service representative working for the @entity189 in @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity3 had no benefits			1
" i was looking at being faced with tens of thousands of surgeries and no way to pay for it , " she said			0
" i cried -- woo i cried			0
" health companies turned her down for her pre-existing condition and government assistance denied her coverage for making too much money			1
breaking down the court 's decision a friend told her about the @entity137 , insurance coverage under the @entity202 , and @entity3 was accepted			1
to raise the $ 5,000 co-pay she needed for surgery , plus the $ 13,000 emergency room visit , @entity3 's friends and family staged a large garage sale			1
she also asked online supporters for donations			0
another fundraising avenue for @entity3 was her hobby -- creating hand - made jewelry like her silver and gem - stone tree of life pendant			2
today her hobby has become her primary source of income			0
@entity218 laid @entity3 off after she took a long absence from work to have her surgery			2
@entity3 , a @entity222 and self - described liberal , says she is grateful to @entity58 for his health care reform legislation because 51 million people like her are denied basic health care because they do n't have health insurance			1
although she was excited when her story was featured on @entity58 's re-election website , she 's more excited by thursday 's announcement			0
" we had to drag people forward for @entity233 rights , civil rights			0
equality in this country , discrimination in this country , these are issues people fought against -- and health care is just the latest , " she said			0
" i totally get that about the country : bad or good , you have to drag people kicking and screaming into the future			0
" @entity58 : @entity18 ruling on health care a victory for all @entity28 opinion : are voters ready to move on ? photos : who is @entity253 ? overheard on @entity2 : health care law a ' necessary evil '			1

@entity3 's " i am @entity23 " photo went viral across the political blogosphere
@entity18 ruling helps @entity28 who need insurance for pre-existing health conditions
a part - time employee with no benefits , she could n't afford surgery for tumors in her uterus
