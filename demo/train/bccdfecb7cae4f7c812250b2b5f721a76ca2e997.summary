@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 gov. @entity3 won his state 's @entity5 gubernatorial primary outright on tuesday , avoiding a potentially costly runoff election against sen. @entity8			1
@entity8 called @entity3 to concede the race after returns indicated that the governor was cruising toward a resounding victory in the closely - watched primary			1
" now we must unite , " she said			0
" we must win @entity1 for @entity5			1
" @entity3 's win ended a yearlong intra-party fight that was billed from the start as a clash of @entity1 political titans but ended with a whimper as @entity8 struggled to fight a tide of anti-washington sentiment among conservatives			1
the governor cast his victory as a warning shot to @entity27 in the mold of recent @entity5 wins in the @entity32 and @entity33 governor 's races and the @entity36 special @entity35 election			2
" i think the message is pretty clear , " @entity3 told supporters at his election night party near @entity39			2
" conservatism has never been stronger than it is today			0
" @entity3 said the message to @entity27 was simple : " quit spending all the money , " he said			2
" stop trying to take over our lives and our businesses			0
" he added : " stop messing with @entity1 ! " @entity3 , the longest serving governor in @entity1 history , is seeking a third full term in @entity39			1
his opponent in the general election will be @entity52 @entity51 , the former @entity53 mayor who dispatched six opponents in the @entity56 primary			1
with nearly two - thirds of precincts reporting , @entity3 maintained a 20 - point lead over @entity8 and appeared to be on pace to cross the crucial 50 percent mark needed to avoid a six - week runoff election against the three - term senator , who began her gubernatorial bid as the prohibitive frontrunner but stumbled as @entity3 's campaign cast her as a big - spending @entity27 insider			1
@entity5 activist @entity68 , a conservative with strong support among @entity72 activists , looked to be headed for a third place finish			2
@entity51 , the popular former three - term mayor of @entity53 , the country 's fourth - largest city , predicted that @entity3 will try to nationalize the race and tie him to unpopular @entity56 agenda items in @entity27			1
" he 'll run against president @entity79 , " @entity51 said in an interview			0
" that 's probably for his own political career			0
i think he wants to run for president			0
i 'm just running for the people of @entity1			0
it should n't be about a party or who 's doing what to whom in @entity27			0
