-- there 's a photo of the @entity3 on the cover of the september 24 , 1971 , issue of @entity6			2
in it , @entity7 and @entity8 stand at the foot of a set of stairs , their star children -- known as the @entity14 -- arrayed behind them			1
the @entity16 brothers , here in the 1970s , were driven to be great by their father , @entity7			1
they appear to be the all - american clan , gold records arranged behind them , the boys loose and smiling , the parents more awkward and serious in their demeanor			2
over the years , that fa√ßade crumbled			2
the brothers bickered ; some made accusations of abuse			2
but the group remained tight - knit through crises , including thursday 's tragedy , when @entity16 collapsed at his house and later died at @entity36			1
the journey began with music in @entity39 , @entity40			2
@entity7 , the patriarch , played in a short - lived band called the @entity42 ( no relation to the @entity45 - based group featuring @entity46 ) in the 1950s			1
his primary job , however , was as a crane operator at @entity49			2
@entity8 , the musical and devoutly religious woman who he married in 1949 , tended to the couple 's large family : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity16 and @entity60 , all born between 1950 and 1961			1
daughter @entity62 arrived in 1966			2
by that time , the three oldest boys -- @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 -- had started their own group , which @entity59 and @entity16 eventually joined			1
@entity7 saw a chance for his sons to have the musical career he 'd found elusive			1
@entity7 admitted being a harsh taskmaster			1
he drove his sons hard , forcing them to rehearse with a @entity70 - like intensity			2
he was n't above emphasizing his feelings to his seventh child , @entity16			1
" my father teased me and i just hated it and i cried every day , " @entity16 told @entity73 in 1993			1
he said his father also beat him : " he was very strict , very hard , very stern			1
... there 's been times when he 'd come to see me , i 'd get sick , i 'd start to regurgitate			0
" he quickly said , imagining his father 's reaction , " please do n't be mad at me			1
" @entity7 disputed the word " beat , " but did n't question @entity16 's account			1
" i whipped him with a switch and a belt , " he told the @entity84 in 2003			0
he added , " i never beat him			0
you beat someone with a stick			0
" in a 2005 interview with @entity0 's @entity93 , @entity57 defended his father 's actions			1
" we grew up like any other black family			1
you did something , you got your butt tore up , and it was n't tore up , it was just , you got a spanking , " he said			0
" i will say this			0
he kept us off of the streets			0
he kept us away from drugs			0
he kept us away from gangs and ... we 've been able to project a talent out there and have the support of strong people to entertain the world			0
" by 1968 , when @entity16 turned 10 , the @entity14 was a professional musical machine			1
they 'd won an @entity114 talent night the previous year and were working the " chitlin circuit " of black clubs when producer @entity115 urged @entity116 to sign the group			1
@entity116 founder @entity120 was impressed and made them " the last big stars to come off my assembly line , " according to a biography on the @entity126 web site			0
the group shot out of the gate with four no. 1 hits and gained a huge fan base , along with an animated tv show			2
but success took its toll , particularly when it was n't so easy to come by			0
in the mid- 1970s , the band -- minus @entity57 , who 'd married @entity120 's daughter @entity137 -- moved to @entity138 , where they were produced by the @entity140 soul - funk team of @entity141 and @entity141			0
the two remember nothing but good times from the sessions , which produced two albums and the @entity147 hit " @entity146			0
" " it was a collaboration , " @entity141 said			0
" they all participated in creating			0
@entity56 was a great guitarist -- they were all great musicians			0
" @entity151 said he visited the @entity16 compound during a trip to @entity154 and remembered a warm family setting , complete with a " fantastic meal " cooked by @entity8			1
" i 've got nothing but respect for the father , " added @entity141			2
" he 's a great man			0
he made something out of nothing			0
" even during that era , however , @entity16 was standing out			1
@entity141 and @entity151 recalled him taking a keen interest in recording technology and the way he sounded			0
going solo with @entity166 producing , as he did in 1979 , was the right move , @entity141 and @entity151 said			0
the family dynamics kept changing as the siblings grew older			1
after @entity16 's " @entity173 " became the biggest album of all time , the brothers -- including @entity57 -- regrouped for a new album , " @entity176 , " and accompanying tour			1
but @entity16 , now the undisputed draw , disagreed with some of the tour plans and ended up donating his earnings to charity			1
@entity16 's brightened spotlight boosted the careers of his siblings ; even @entity54 had a hit			1
but it was @entity62 who broke out with the most success , including the no. 1 singles " @entity190 , " " @entity191 " and " again " in the 1980s and ' 90s			0
with the increased interest in the @entity14 came tabloid scrutiny of the family 's every move			2
when @entity58 appeared nude in @entity197 , the story made headlines			0
she later criticized @entity16 and was on the outs for several years			1
@entity57 put out a song called " @entity202 to the badd , " an attack on @entity16 , in 1991 ; he later changed the lyrics			1
@entity62 's relationships were probed in detail , as were the brothers ' marriages			2
and @entity16 , of course , was seen as increasingly eccentric , his personality overwhelming his music			1
but for all their own bickering , the family closed ranks when a member was attacked			1
in 1992 , @entity57 co-produced " the @entity14 : an @entity218 , " a tv miniseries based on @entity8 's memoir , which chronicled their rise to stardom			0
when @entity16 faced molestation allegations in the early ' 90s and was tried in 2005 , the family rallied around			1
" the jackson family was groomed to be a team , " said @entity226 , president and ceo of @entity230 and @entity231 magazines ' @entity228 and a longtime family friend			1
" as you can see through their performances , they were always there for each other			0
" in recent years , @entity58 has appeared on the reality shows " @entity243 " and the @entity244 " celebrity big brother			0
" she originally had a scene in the forthcoming @entity249 movie , " @entity250 , " but @entity0 confirmed the scene has been cut , " out of respect for @entity16 's family , " the studio told the ( @entity244 ) @entity254			1
@entity57 , who converted to @entity255 and changed his name to @entity257 , appeared on " celebrity @entity242 " in 2007			0
@entity55 runs a record label , @entity56 remains involved in the music business , and according to a 2008 article in the @entity261 , @entity59 and @entity60 have struggled financially			0
in the hospital emergency room thursday , @entity60 and @entity57 were witnessed hugging and crying over their late brother			0
" we 're a family , " @entity57 told @entity93 in the 2005 interview			2
" we 're no different than any other family who has feuds and problems			2
... but at the same time , we 're united , and we have a united front that is very , very strong , and it 's supported by @entity273			0
" my mother and father did a great job in instilling the morals and principles in us from the very beginning			2
we feel that with that , that 's all you need to go through life			0
" @entity0 's @entity285 contributed to this article .			0
