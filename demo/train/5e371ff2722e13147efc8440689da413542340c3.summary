@entity1 , @entity0 -- a grand slam finale that was n't supposed to be dramatic turned out to be one of the most memorable in recent history			1
here @entity6 was , in his first major final at the @entity8 , facing world no. 1 @entity9 -- who he had never even taken a set off in 12 previous matches			1
@entity9 looked sharp in disposing of @entity12 in the semifinals and not many thought he would n't complete the deal against the 17 - time grand slam winner 's fellow @entity16 , even if @entity6 upset three - time defending champion @entity18 in the quarterfinals			1
but not for the first time in @entity1 , an injury to @entity9 early in an encounter hampered the @entity23 and @entity6 opened his grand slam account with a stunning 6 - 3 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 3 victory			1
" bad luck was against me today but you really deserved it so congratulations , " @entity9 , wiping away tears , told the crowd post match in a scene reminiscent of @entity12 's runner - up speech in 2009			1
" sorry to finish this way			0
i tried very , very hard			0
" but there was elation for @entity6			2
" it 's quite crazy what 's happening right now , " the 28 - year - old told reporters later			1
" i never expected to win a grand slam			1
i never dreamed about that because for me , i was not good enough to beat those guys			0
" read more : @entity6 stuns @entity18 @entity12 complained about @entity9 's grunting friday and when the 13 - time grand slam winner received a time violation warning from chair umpire @entity46 in the first game of the second set , some at @entity50 applauded			1
that was simply the start of the spectacle			0
@entity9 clutched his back and called for the trainer going off court for treatment			2
when he returned , there were boos from some sections of the crowd , a rare , if almost unheard of , occurrence for @entity9			2
" i can understand very well the reaction , " @entity9 told reporters			2
" they understood later that i was ( hurt )			0
" he said he injured the back in the warm - up and the condition worsened as the first set progressed			0
" then at the beginning of the second set was the key moment that i felt , during a serve ... it was very stiff , very bad , " @entity9 said			2
" but it 's not the moment to talk about that			0
" during the medical timeout , @entity6 jawed with @entity46 , demanding to know what the injury was -- @entity46 declined to tell the 28 - year - old but tournament referee @entity79 later obliged			2
a distraught @entity9 could n't help but cry -- because of the injury -- and with little on his serve , @entity6 coasted to the second set			1
@entity9 must have flashed back to 2011 in @entity1 , when a leg injury sustained against @entity82 in the quarterfinals ended his chances of achieving the " @entity85 " -- four grand slam titles in succession			1
he missed last year 's tournament as he recovered from a knee injury			0
" it 's true that i was not very lucky and this is a tournament that is painful for me , " said @entity9			2
such was the state of @entity9 that a first retirement in a men 's grand slam final in 24 years appeared a distinct possibility			1
" the last thing i wanted to do was retire , " said @entity9			0
" at the same time it 's tough to see yourself during the whole year working for a moment like this , and the moment arrives and you are not able to play at your best			0
" @entity9 did n't call it quits , @entity6 squandered break points in the opening game of the third and two more in the final game of the set			2
@entity9 thereby maintained his streak of never losing a grand slam final in straight sets			1
fireworks to mark @entity116 erupted at about the same time , and soon chants of " @entity118 " filled the stadium			0
with @entity9 , though , continuing to lack pace on his serve , @entity6 broke for 5 - 3 and closed the match out with a winning forehand			1
" it 's a final of a grand slam , so i 'm really happy to win it , " said @entity6			1
" it 's not the way a tennis player wants to win a match -- because the opponent is injured			0
" @entity118 is a really good friend			0
but when it happens , you have to take it			0
it 's maybe once in my life i will appear in a grand slam final			1
" not in 21 years had a men 's player ousted the top two seeds at a grand slam , @entity18 being the no. 2			1
@entity9 was thus deprived of a 14th major , which would have placed him joint second with @entity142 -- he was at @entity50 to present the trophies -- and three behind @entity12 on the men 's all - time list			1
@entity9 's plight sunday is sure to dominate the headlines but @entity6 's performance should n't be forgotten			1
with more oomph on his ground strokes now than @entity12 and earning free points on serve , nerves were n't a factor in the first set			0
" the @entity6 we have now has nothing to do with the @entity6 who lost 12 times to @entity118 , " @entity155 , a @entity156 analyst and @entity158 ' coach , told @entity2			0
" he beat @entity18 and for sure this really changed something in his belief and ability to win a grand slam			1
" and if you look at his game , he has so much more pace on his shots ( than @entity12 ) , and that is so important against @entity118			0
" good fortune does n't hurt at a grand slam , and @entity9 's ailment , combined with @entity6 's opponent retiring in the first round and his foe in the third round pulling out altogether , aided him			1
but @entity6 -- who took @entity18 to five sets in two majors last year -- has become consistent under @entity182 coach @entity181 and will rise to a career high no. 3 in the world when the new rankings are released , five spots better than @entity12			2
courtesy of @entity6 , the @entity188 stranglehold at grand slams this decade is over			2
his talent is evident and his achievement will surely be applauded			0
on sunday , however , it was @entity9 who still commanded much of the attention			0
just not for the reasons we all thought			0

@entity6 : " it 's quite crazy what 's happening right now . i never expected to win a grand slam . "
