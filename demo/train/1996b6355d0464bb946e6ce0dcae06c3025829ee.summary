he appeared in court two days later , after which he was ordered held on $ 23 million bail -- $ 1 million for each of the 23 counts of lewd acts on a child that he faces			1

@entity15 has not yet entered a plea			0
since his initial appearance , @entity30 spokesman sgt. @entity29 said an additional 200 photographs purportedly taken by the longtime @entity12 teacher had been found			1
it is uncertain what , if any , additional charges @entity15 may face as a result of that discovery or other developments in the investigation			0
the law enforcement probe began when investigators found " over 40 photographs depicting children in a school classroom , with their eyes blindfolded and mouths covered with tape , " a @entity30 's statement said			1
" investigators learned that some of the photos depicted suspect @entity12 with his arm around the children , or with his hand over their mouths , " according to the sheriff 's department			1
some photos showed " children with large live @entity63 - type cockroaches on their faces and mouths			2
" others show female students with " what appeared to be a blue plastic spoon , filled with an unknown clear / white liquid substance , up to their mouths as if they were going to ingest the substance , " said the sheriff 's department			0
@entity29 said that @entity15 was arrested soon after lab testing matched @entity15 's dna with a substance -- later determined to be semen -- from a blue plastic spoon and an empty container from a trash bin in his classroom			1
the young students " did n't realize they were victimized , " said the sheriff 's department spokesman			0
