@entity2 weapons inspectors returned " overwhelming and indisputable " evidence of the use of nerve gas in @entity6 , @entity0 ban ki - moon said monday , calling the findings " beyond doubt and beyond the pale			1
" the inspectors ' 38 - page report was released after @entity0 briefed @entity13 members on its contents			1
the team found what it called " clear and convincing evidence " that the nerve agent sarin was delivered by surface - to - surface rockets " on a relatively large scale " in the suburbs of the @entity6 capital @entity23 on august 21			2
" it is the most significant confirmed use of chemical weapons against civilians since @entity28 used them in @entity29 in 1988 , and the worst use of weapons of mass destruction in the 21st century , " @entity0 said			1
" the international community has a responsibility to ensure that chemical weapons never re-emerge as an instrument of warfare , " he said			0
@entity0 called the attack " a war crime " and a violation of treaties banning the use of chemical weapons that date back to 1925			1
but the inspectors ' mandate did not include assigning blame for the attack , and @entity0 would not speculate on who launched the attack			1
the team did identify two types or rockets it said were used to deliver the gas and their trajectories , and international observers have said those weapons are not known to be in the hands of rebels battling the government of @entity6 president @entity61			2
@entity63 @entity2 ambassador @entity62 , who is currently serving as president of the @entity13 , said the report bolsters his country 's stance			0
it " confirms , in our view , that there is no remaining doubt that it was the regime that used chemical weapons			2
" read the report and @entity75 , the @entity76 ambassador , said a preliminary review of the report points toward forces loyal to @entity61			1
" the regime possesses sarin , and we have no evidence that the opposition possesses sarin , " @entity75 said			0
" it defies logic " to think members of the opposition would have infiltrated a regime - controlled area to fire on opposition - controlled areas			0
@entity94 , @entity95 , and @entity96 have also said @entity61 's regime was behind the attack			0
but @entity99 is @entity6 's leading ally , and @entity99 @entity2 ambassador @entity101 maintained @entity103 's stance that @entity6 rebels might be to blame			2
such suggestions " can not be simply shrugged off , " @entity101 said , and statements insisting that the opposition could not have launched the attack " are not as scientific and grounded in reality as the actual situation could be			0
" he questioned why rebel forces did n't report major losses in the august 21 chemical attack , which the @entity76 says may have killed more than 1,400 , including hundreds of civilians			1
samples examined the august 21 attack led to @entity76 calls for military action against @entity6 , which denies its forces unleashed chemical weapons and blamed rebel fighters for the deaths			1
@entity6 has since agreed to join the 1993 @entity122 and hand over its chemical arsenal to international inspectors , with the @entity76 and @entity99 laying out a fast - paced framework for @entity23 to follow			1
monday 's report presents a stark picture of the damage that can be inflicted by a nerve agent like sarin , one of three types of poison gas @entity6 is believed to have stockpiled			1
" survivors reported that following an attack with shelling , they quickly experienced a range of symptoms , including shortness of breath , disorientation , eye irritation , blurred vision , nausea , vomiting and general weakness , " @entity0 said			2
" many eventually lost consciousness			0
first responders described seeing a large number of individuals lying on the ground , many of them dead or unconscious			0
" the weather made things worse			0
falling temperatures at the time of the attack meant the downward movement of air , allowing the gas " to easily penetrate the basements and lower levels of buildings and other structures where many people were seeking shelter , " @entity0 said			2
inspectors interviewed survivors and first responders , collected hair , urine and blood samples and took soil and environmental samples from the sites where the rockets fell			0
the secretary - general said the team " adhered to the most stringent protocols available for such an investigation , including to ensure the chain of custody for all samples			0
" more than 100,000 people had already been killed in @entity6 before august 21 , according to the @entity2			2
another 2 million have fled the country , most of them taking refuge in @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189			2
it was not immediately clear how the report would affect events on the ground			0
the opposition @entity194 said the findings " demand a unified and decisive response by the international community			1
" " if the world does not act now , this war will continue , and thousands more will die , " @entity198 , the coalition 's representative to the @entity2 , said in a written statement			0
" the people of @entity6 look to the @entity13 to do everything in its power to stop this conflict and hold the @entity6 regime responsible for its criminal actions			2
" in @entity210 , the @entity209 announced that president @entity211 would waive restrictions on exporting chemical protective gear to provide that equipment to the opposition and train " select , vetted members " in its use			1
@entity76 equipment will also be provided to the @entity220 , the international body that monitors compliance with the @entity122			2
it will be @entity220 inspectors who are likely to carry out @entity6 's promised disarmament			1
@entity6 : there 's a chemical weapons agreement			1
now what ? also monday , @entity187 fighter jets downed a @entity6 helicopter near the border between the two countries monday , @entity187 's semiofficial @entity233 reported , citing deputy prime minister @entity234			1
@entity6 's state news agency @entity235 said the helicopter was watching for " terrorists " crossing the border and erroneously strayed into @entity187 airspace , but was on its way back across the border when shot down			1
@entity99 slams @entity76 remarks on agreement even as the world awaited the @entity2 inspectors ' report monday , @entity99 openly bickered with the @entity76 about the agreement they struck in @entity246 over the weekend			1
the framework they laid out calls for a @entity2 resolution demanding that @entity6 's chemical weapons be placed under international control			1
@entity13 powers are now trying to put that framework into a resolution			0
but @entity99 foreign minister @entity255 on monday accused @entity76 secretary of state @entity256 " and his @entity258 allies " of misunderstanding the deal , according to @entity99 's state - run @entity262 news agency			0
@entity255 said the deal does not say the @entity2 resolution will be under @entity264 of the @entity2 charter , which potentially authorizes the use of force -- and comments by @entity76 secretary of state @entity256 that the any resolution will need to include the possibility of force " show unwillingness to read the document " that @entity99 and the @entity76 endorsed			0
the agreement states that if there is noncompliance " or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in @entity6 , the @entity13 should impose measures under @entity264 of the @entity275			1
" but it does not specifically state that the resolution being sought now will be under that chapter			0
@entity99 holds veto power on the council			0
but @entity256 told reporters monday that " should diplomacy fail , the military option is still on the table			0
" " if the @entity61 regime believes that this is not enforceable , then they will play games , " he said			0
framework for eliminating @entity6 chemical weapons according to the plan , @entity6 must submit a full list of its chemical weapons stockpile within a week			1
international inspectors must be on the ground in the country by november , and all production equipment must be destroyed by the end of november			0
by the middle of next year , all chemical weapons material must be destroyed , according to the agreement			0
but the process of securing and destroying @entity6 's cache of chemical weapons -- in the middle of a civil war -- may be a logistical nightmare .			1
