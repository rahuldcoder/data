@entity0 , @entity1 -- no pizza maestro worth his sauce will reveal his secrets			1
not even if he 's 9 and hoisting up his apron so he does n't trip on it			1
" i 'm going to have to know you better , " @entity9 says with a smile , as he sprinkles ingredients onto freshly tossed dough			0
" and if i tell you , i 'll have to kill you			0
" it 's a wednesday evening and the third - grader is where he usually comes after school -- @entity20 , the dream - come - true business established by his father , @entity23			1
the father / son duo moved from @entity26 two years ago to start a unique pizza place , one that would reflect their family 's @entity29 roots			1
four months ago , the restaurant on the west side of @entity0 , @entity1 , opened its doors			1
in the large open kitchen , where patrons crowd to eat over large metal worktables , @entity9 is at home			0
he does his schoolwork -- math is his favorite subject -- in the restaurant office			1
but otherwise he 's working the crowd in his signature newsboy - style hat , tossing and stretching dough ( a skill he began developing at age 4 ) and making grown women swoon			1
" he wanted to know if this was my first time here , " a 32 - year - old woman gushes , her hand over her heart			1
" oh , he 's so cute			0
" asked where he was born , @entity54 , sporting a red kerchief around his neck , is quick to say @entity57			1
but his father , standing within earshot , shakes his head and laughs			1
" he thinks he was , " @entity9 , 45 , mutters			0
" @entity57 , " in @entity26 , " is more like it			1
" along one wall are the imported mixers and sacks of @entity66 flour from @entity67 , where @entity23 's grandparents came from and where the family pizza - making tradition began			1
on the opposite side of the kitchen are three handcrafted ovens -- weighing in at 30,000 pounds -- that heat up to more than 1,000 degrees and bake a pizza to perfection in 60 seconds			1
combining ancient @entity80 brick with beds of volcanic rock from @entity83 and @entity85 stone , only seven of these @entity78 ovens exist in the @entity86 , @entity9 says			0
he has three of them			0
propped atop each one is a patron saint , including above the center oven @entity91 , the patron saint of @entity67 -- which is also the name of @entity9 's signature pizza , one that includes sweet and spicy peppers from a location he refuses to name -- or rather , confirm			1
@entity9 says they come from @entity98			0
his father counters with @entity100			2
later , one of them says @entity103			0
the game of guarding a family recipe secret is one the boy knows how to play			1
if he had his way , @entity9 might be hanging out to the sound of @entity109			0
but the songs that fill the @entity20 kitchen include @entity113 's " in @entity78 , " @entity112 's " @entity114 " and @entity116 's " @entity115 " the maestros at the ovens get especially worked up during @entity119 's " @entity67 " -- the song , about a guy making pizza , that 's used to pump up the @entity67 soccer team before games			1
wearing a team jersey emblazoned on the back with his nickname " @entity129 " ( usually shortened to " @entity119 " or " @entity128 " ) , @entity9 grabs a 12 - foot - long wooden paddle and maneuvers one of his pizzas into an oven			2
" @entity134 , bravo ! @entity128 ! " his father calls out , while standing beside the woman he recently asked to marry him			2
@entity136 was studying to get her mba at nearby @entity138 when she was introduced to this place			0
she walked into the under - construction kitchen for an interview , wanting to do some bookkeeping for @entity9			2
" i came in all @entity144 - suited up , " she says , laughing at the memory			2
" he asked me , ' you like pizza ? ' i said , ' no. ' " with that , she says , the interview stopped			2
@entity9 got to work in front of the ovens , then placed one of his creations before her			0
" i ate the whole damn pizza myself , " she says , shaking her head			2
she was sold on the business , and even before the engagement she put school on hold to help make @entity9 's dream happen			2
telling her father she was dropping out to work at a pizza place did n't go over well at first , she says , but one trip down from his @entity167 home and her dad understood			1
" i thought i made a pretty mean pizza , " @entity169 said by phone			2
" then i go and see the place			0
... i 'm watching these people come in			0
i just could n't believe how they kept coming			0
they came until they ran out of dough			0
" on saturday nights , @entity9 says , they usually have to lock the door to new customers at around 7:30 p.m. it 's not just any pizza , and @entity9 knows this , too			1
he 'd like to start a class to teach other kids how to make a proper pizza , and he grimaces and gives a thumbs - down at the mere mention of places like @entity190 's and @entity191 's			1
but he also munches on prepackaged convenience store beef jerky while strolling past a bin of specialty dried aged beef fit for his father 's pizzas , and says of @entity199 , " they rock ! " he absently grabs a handful of fresh basil and pops it in his mouth as he talks about his favorite movies , " a lot of blood and gore , " he says , his eyes lighting up			2
later , while making a mask out of dough for a 7 - year - old boy who 's in the restaurant to celebrate his birthday , @entity9 blurts out , " you ever hear of @entity215 ? that 's one of the coolest serial killers			1
" he rattles off his other hobbies -- skateboarding , soccer and his @entity222 included -- and boasts of other skills			2
tossing mints in the air , he pumps his fist when he catches three in a row			0
" my second - best talent is jumping two chairs in a row , the long way , " he says , minutes before grabbing hold of his flour gun			0
yes , @entity9 is there in the family restaurant , charming the patrons			0
but he 's also a boy who , frankly , can act like one			0
taking -- and wearing -- handfuls of imported flour , he loads his weapon			0
@entity241 ! he blasts his uncle @entity242 , visiting from out of town , in the back of the head			0
poof ! he shoots a boy who 's dining with his family point - blank in the face			1
" @entity252 , " his father calls out over the crowd and white cloud , " it might be time to put the gun away			0
" leaving the laughing boy customer behind , @entity9 saunters off -- maybe to chat up several women who are smiling his way or , if he 's feeling it , to create the sort of pizza that would make his ancestors proud .			1

boy , 9 , has been tossing *pie* , making pizza and guarding secrets since he was 4
father - son duo opens @entity0 , @entity1 , restaurant reflecting @entity67 , @entity57 , roots
son , who comes in after school , charms -- and sometimes terrorizes -- customers
