-- next week 's episode of @entity2 is going to have a vip : the vp			1
@entity5 — yes , the very guy who was re-elected vice president of the @entity8 — will guest - star in the nov. 15 installment of @entity2 , @entity0 has learned			1
his cameo occurs at the beginning of the episode , in which former @entity14 campaign manager @entity13 ( @entity15 ) takes fiancée / city councilwoman @entity16 ( @entity17 ) , to the @entity18 to meet @entity8 's no. 2 , who has long been her no. 1 crush			0
( as @entity16 once noted , her ideal man has " the brains of @entity24 and the body of @entity5			1
" ) @entity26 scored camera time with @entity5 in july when the show traveled to @entity29 to film its season 5 premiere , which featured appearances by senators @entity32 , @entity34 , and @entity35			1
how big of a casting coup was @entity5 for @entity38 's small - town government comedy ? " given that @entity41 and @entity42 are no longer with us , this is probably no. 1 , " quips executive producer @entity39			1
" [ @entity16 ] has a lot of female heroes that cross party lines			0
she has a lot of social figures that she considers heroes , but the funniest hero is @entity5			1
there 's an episode last season where she says , ' @entity5 is on my celebrity sex list — well , he is my celebrity sex list ' ... it was amazing to have her meet @entity34 and @entity32 because that meant something to her politically			1
she 's meeting the man that she 's in love with on some deep level			0
it was a bigger deal to us in some ways that she meet @entity5 than it was that she meet @entity72			2
" ( @entity72 , by the way , has revealed that he watches @entity26 with his family , by the way			0
" it 's a very amazing and weird thing to find out that the president watches your show , " marvels @entity39			2
) once the producers committed to shooting an episode in @entity29 , the process of landing @entity5 was " so much less difficult than we ever possibly imagined , " says @entity39 , noting : " his staff really loves the show , and he apparently had watched the show with his family and his family liked it ... the hardest part was keeping it secret for so long because there 's all these @entity92 rules and equal - time rules			1
we could n't air it before the election because it was the equivalent of a campaign contribution to advertise for one candidate			0
" the @entity99 , a surprise " engagement present " from @entity13 , lasts less than a minute and was written in a manner that would work regardless of the election 's outcome			0
" we did not in any way want the moment to be a political issue — we treated it in the writing and the execution like our main character was meeting her hero , " says @entity39			0
( he notes that the writers did pen an addendum to the scene in the event of an @entity72 - @entity5 loss or a " weird @entity119 disaster tie			1
" ) the meeting takes place in the vice president 's @entity122 in the @entity18 - adjacent @entity124 , with @entity5 flanked by his real - life staff			1
" they have a conversation where she does what you would imagine @entity16 would do when meeting @entity5 , which is she loses control of herself a little bit , " hints @entity39			2
" she gets really giggly and goofy around him			0
" when the @entity2 crew set up in his office to shoot the scene , @entity5 happened to be tied up in a meeting with ... president @entity72			1
then " @entity72 got on @entity139 and flew away , and @entity5 walked across the executive building and we shot the scene , " says @entity39			2
" it was really cool : you go this way and get on a helicopter that will take you to some incredibly important thing , and you come this way and shoot a scene with @entity17			0
" the @entity149 handled his scene like a pro , even ad - libbing a response to a crazy @entity16 retort that wound up in the final cut of the episode			2
" he was very nice and charming , " reports @entity39			0
" he was clearly a big fan of @entity17			2
it was the day the @entity160 nominations came out and when he walked through the door he congratulated her on her @entity160 nomination ... he said some very nice things about the show and talked about how the pro-public service message was meaningful			2
" while @entity39 & co. were thrilled to venture onto hallowed @entity29 ground , they are n't plotting the next great political cameo right now : " since the beginning of the show , @entity5 has been the no. 1 guy , so in terms of her achievements or personal milestones we 'll have to go in a different direction , " he says			1
" she 'll have to get her thrills elsewhere			0
