-- a luxury cruise ship collided in deep fog with a container ship off @entity5 , punching a hole in the container ship and knocking passengers off their feet , a passenger told @entity0 monday			1
" the foghorn at the back of the ship had been going off consistently , throughout the morning , " passenger @entity10 said monday from @entity11 about the incident , which occurred friday morning when the @entity13 was about five miles from the coast			1
" but there was a certain point in time when the foghorn at the front of the ship suddenly sounded			1
and it was much much louder			0
and it caused us to look up			0
and in fact we looked up straight out of the window			0
and through the fog , to our horror , we saw this @entity5 container ship appear , sideways on			1
and it was as if our ship was perfectly lined up to hit it in the side			1
@entity10 said he and his wife had braced themselves for the impact and stayed upright			0
" so , it was a horrifying moment			0
and in less than about five seconds after the ship appeared			1
we did in fact collide right in the side of it			2
" in a statement , @entity44 said the @entity13 " was involved in a minor incident on march 16 , 2012 , at around 4:20 gmt as it was approaching the pilot station in @entity48 , @entity5			1
there was contact between @entity13 and a local commercial vessel			2
@entity13 incurred limited minor dents and guests ' safety was never compromised			2
the ship was fully operational and continued on its course to @entity48 , where all shore tours operated normally			2
" lock disputed the cruise line 's characterization of the incident			1
" it was a major collision , " he said			1
@entity63 and her husband @entity64 were in their suite when the collision occurred			2
the @entity68 couple recalled hearing the vessel 's horn blast several times			2
then they felt the ship hit something			1
" it was like a full stop			2
just -- boom ! " she said			0
@entity10 said he and his wife saw that the container ship was damaged			1
" the @entity5 ship rolled over -- at a 90 - degree angle , " @entity10 said			1
" in fact , we thought it was going to capsize			0
and with the forward momentum of our ship , it pushed the @entity5 ship around , so that it actually came down the side , the length of our ship , scraping along the side as it went			1
and from that viewpoint , we could see just how much damage had been done to that ship , and it was substantial			2
" he said he was n't aware of any injuries aboard the luxury vessel , which had a hole dug in its bow , but said the other vessel was badly damaged			1
" we struck the other ship in several places that we could see -- we struck it at the bridge , where they would operate from , " @entity10 said			2
" we literally crushed the ship inwards			2
and we also struck the sides of the ship , causing a tear along the side , a vertical tear , quite substantial			1
and as we passed by the other ship , i personally saw several of their crew members just lying on the deck			2
" see @entity10 's @entity118 image @entity63 says she and her husband were not instructed by cruise staff about what to do after the collision			1
there was confusion in the hallways as passengers tried to figure out what had happened and whether they were safe , she said			0
" there was a lot of fear , " she said			0
" the people around me were crying ... for quite some minutes there was nothing to indicate what the crew were [ doing ] or what [ we should ] do			0
" the couple and lock say that passengers gathered a few of their possessions and headed to the muster stations			0
" the crew was calm , but the passengers -- some were scared , or even frantic , " @entity10 said			0
but after about 10 minutes , the captain announced that there was no imminent danger , he said			0
as they made their way to the station , @entity63 said she and her husband approached cruise officers and asked them how the collision happened			1
was n't there radar or some kind of technology aboard that would warn if another ship was close ? she says cruise employees repeatedly answered by saying that the cruise ship " had the right of way			1
" when they kept asking questions , she says cruise staffers walked away			0
" i would use the word arrogant , " she said			0
" they were acting as if we had , really , no right to ask the question			0
" the ship went on to anchor in @entity48 as planned			0
" the next day , we went to a nearby port and once we were off the ship we could see how extensive the damage was , " @entity10 said			0
