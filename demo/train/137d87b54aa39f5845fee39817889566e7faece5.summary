-- the former lead investigator in the @entity3 case says that newly released documents may spark renewed interest , but they have little effect on the cold case investigation			1
previously sealed court documents released friday show that a @entity10 grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents of the slain 6 - year - old @entity3 on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime			1
court papers : grand jury in 1999 sought to indict @entity3 's parents the district attorney decided that year , however , not to file charges against @entity23 and @entity24 , saying there was insufficient evidence			2
in 2008 , a new district attorney said new dna evidence cleared the parents and their son in the death			0
the case has never been solved , and the released documents have put the killing back in the spotlight			1
but attention does not necessarily translate into leads in the case , former lead investigator @entity35 told @entity0			1
" it is unlikely unless there is a confession , or somebody else comes forward that has information that has been shared with them , " he said			0
read the documents @entity35 wrote a book about @entity3 's killing and said he does not believe that there was an intruder at the @entity50 that night , implying that the @entity55 family -- the @entity55 , her husband @entity23 and their son @entity52 -- know more than they have told			2
what exactly was it that kept the district attorney from pursuing the charges ? " that 's a very complicated question			0
i think there are a lot of things that could be considered missing from the @entity67 's perspective to be able to bring them to a threshold of prosecuting beyond a reasonable doubt , " @entity35 said			0
still , the documents released friday are an important part of the history of the case			1
a @entity10 court ordered the release of the previously sealed court documents about the unsolved 1996 death of the girl who won child beauty pageants and whose murder shocked the nation			0
the pages were sealed in 1999 , after the grand jury in the case dispersed without charges being filed .			0

a former lead investigator says they are important to the history of the case
