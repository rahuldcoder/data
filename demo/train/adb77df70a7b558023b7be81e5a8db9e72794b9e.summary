-- there are few better ways for an actor to show off his chops than by playing the clever trickster in a thriller ( think of @entity7 's 007 at the poker table , or @entity10 's @entity9 leading his @entity12 overseers through the looking glass )			1
in the opening scenes of " @entity16 , " you can tell what a good time @entity18 is having as @entity19 , an @entity20 spy in @entity21 , @entity22 , who is five steps ahead of everyone else			1
his look is pure sleight of hand : in glasses , gray scarf , and overcoat , with an earring , a serious goatee , and his gray - flecked hair teased out , @entity29 resembles a hipster @entity38 -- a great look for him , even if it feels like a costume			2
meeting with an @entity42 agent , @entity19 purchases the mother of all top secret files , then wastes no time pulling out a lab kit that allows him to inject the file right under his skin			1
very tricky ! moments later , he 's under attack ( a lot of folks want that file ) , so he turns himself in to the @entity20 consulate			2
only then do we learn that @entity19 is a rogue agent who ditched the @entity12 and has spent nine years trading secrets with @entity20 's enemies			0
why has he done this ? and why has he decided to turn himself in ? those questions form the bedrock of @entity29 's hyper - cool , minimalist performance			0
as a crew of @entity12 officials ( @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 ) purse their lips with importance , @entity19 is placed in a @entity12 safe house overseen by @entity70 ( @entity71 ) , who 's been twiddling his thumbs there for a year			0
when thugs enter , yet somehow fail to find @entity19 tethered to a chair , he and @entity10 escape , gunning through the streets in a smash - and - grab car chase			0
the movie , as if on an action time clock , punches in the standard set pieces : bloody fights , clattering shoot - outs , an escape through a packed soccer stadium			1
some of this stuff is well - done , and some of it has been done a lot better			0
yet " @entity16 , " even when it 's pummeling you effectively , has very little up its sleeve			1
basically , the movie is a fizzless " @entity9 " episode crossed with " @entity96 , " featuring @entity29 as a good - egg - gone - rotten who , you know , has his reasons			1
mostly , he schools @entity10 , his guard - turned - pursuer , in what it means to lie			0
@entity71 is physically impressive , even if his acting here consists of morphing from a deer - in - the - headlights look to a mean squint as the movie goes on			2
the director , @entity109 , shoots in highly saturated colors , edits everything into a frenzy , and creates the illusion of intrigue			1
but compared with a superior potboiler like " @entity116 , " which messed with your brain in entertainingly far - fetched ways , " @entity16 " is action - movie porridge gussied up into a less - clever - than - it - seems mystery			1
which is why the trickiness of @entity29 's performance begins to ebb , replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything			2
