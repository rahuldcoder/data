-- 2012 continued its box office winning streak this weekend , as @entity3 replaced herself at the top of the chart			0
her new movie , " @entity6 , " a 3d fourth installment of the popular vampires vs. werewolves franchise , debuted in first place with $ 25.4 million , good for a $ 8,252 per theater average			1
" awakening " improved upon the opening weekend of its predecessor , 2009â € ²s " @entity14 : @entity16 , " which started with $ 20.8 million ( and did not feature @entity3 ) , but fell short of 2006â € ²s " @entity14 : evolution , " which kicked off its run with $ 26.9 million			1
@entity21 / @entity20 paid $ 70 million to make the 3d action film , but if past " @entity14 " performances are any indication , " awakening , " which earned an " a- " @entity29 grade , will have trouble recouping its costs			1
the first " @entity14 " earned 2.5 times its opening weekend ( that 's known as a mulitplier of 2.5 ) and finished with $ 51.8 million			1
the second notched a 2.4 multiplier and earned $ 62.3 million			1
the third only managed a 2.3 multiplier , a sure sign of sequel fatigue and frontloadedness , and grossed $ 45.8 million			1
with @entity3 back in the picture , " awakening " may find a larger total than " lycans , " but with a very young audience ( only 7 percent were 50 or older ) , it should continue the frontloaded trend and finish with about $ 56 million			1
in second place , @entity47 ' passion - project " @entity54 , " a $ 58 million film starring @entity49 and @entity50 that chronicles @entity53 's @entity52 tuskegee airmen , took off with $ 19.1 million in its first three days			1
the strong debut came out of 2,512 theaters , which gave " @entity54 " a hefty $ 7,604 per theater average , the second - best in the @entity60			1
a few weeks ago , these high - flying numbers seemed unlikely			0
but in the week leading up to release , the film gained momentum			0
over the past few days , @entity66 views for the trailer swelled , perhaps thanks to @entity69 's public endorsement of the film			2
in a newsletter to his fans dated january 17 , @entity69 urged audiences to see " @entity54			1
" " i think we should pull together and get behind this movie , " he wrote			0
" not just @entity52 , but all of us			0
" of course , that 's not to undermine @entity78 's marketing team , which clearly did its job and brought in a broad range of ages			0
many films that play primarily to @entity52 audiences ( or really , any niche audience ) drop quickly in their second week -- @entity69 's last three " @entity86 " films have fallen by an average of 60 percent in their second weekends -- but " @entity54 " may avoid a similar fate			1
the film increased by a whopping 40 percent from friday to saturday , a healthy sign that the film is playing well with families and should n't prove overly frontloaded			0
furthermore , audiences enjoyed the film , issuing it an " a " @entity29 grade , which will likely help it endure			0
who knows where the film will end its flight , but after three days of results , " @entity54 " seems early in its ascent			1
@entity3 's other current release , " @entity106 , " which topped the box office last week , dipped by 50 percent down to $ 12.1 million , giving the $ 25 million @entity109 action vehicle a sturdy $ 46.1 million ten - day total			1
it should finish in the $ 65 million range			1
" @entity115 " fared about as expected during its wide release into 2,630 theaters			0
the 9/11 drama , adapted from @entity118 's novel of the same name , found a lukewarm $ 10.5 million this weekend , yielding a mild $ 4,010 per theater average			1
audiences generally liked the @entity123 picture , giving it an " a- " @entity29 grade , but unless " extremely loud " garners a surprising slew of @entity128 nominations next week , it 's doubtful that the film will climb to impressive numbers			0
in 2006 , another 9/11 - themed film , " @entity133 , " opened with a similar $ 11.5 million , and despite good reviews ( much better than " @entity135 's , " in fact ) , it only found $ 31.5 million overall			1
a similar result seems likely in this case			0
is @entity140 the latest performer to fall prey to the @entity143 ? as the legend goes , after an actress wins the coveted @entity128 -- @entity140 won in 2010 for her role in " @entity147 " -- her box office appeal actually decreases			0
look at someone like @entity150			0
since winning the @entity128 in 2004 , she has appeared in exactly one hit -- " @entity152 , " a movie which all but ignored her in its ads -- and among her other nine releases , the highest - grossing one is , sadly , " @entity157 " with $ 25.9 million			2
i 'm not going to put too much faith in the curse , but " extremely loud " does mark @entity140 's least - attended nationwide debut in 15 years			0
and for @entity163 , the film is his second straight misfire since " @entity165 , " which had to settle for $ 35.6 million			2
difficult subject matter likely kept many audiences at bay			0
@entity173 's " haywire " started its run in fifth place , pulling in $ 9 million			1
the film , which features former @entity176 fighter @entity175 , earned a dismal " d + " cinemascore grade , despite strong critical reviews overall			0
( another well reviewed action film , " drive , " earned a similarly unenthusiastic " c - " grade a few months back			0
) relativity shelled out $ 23 million on the film , but " @entity172 " will have to work hard to earn that number back at the box office			2
( also , let 's please ignore the inevitable discussion of whether women can open action movies at the box office and look at this week 's number one film			0
cool ? ) further down the chart , " @entity193 , " which expanded from 216 theaters into 662 theaters ( that 's a 300 + percent uptick in locations ) on the heels of its @entity199 win for @entity200 , increased by a rather disappointing 99 percent			0
after nine weeks , tons of awards , and a whole lot of press , the black - and - white film has earned $ 12.1 million against a $ 15 million budget			1
perhaps people just do n't want to see a silent movie			0
" @entity210 , " meanwhile , is faring much better during awards season			0
following @entity214 's @entity213 win at the @entity215 , the drama increased 17 percent to $ 2.5 million , despite losing 100 locations , and has grossed $ 51.3 million			1
oh , and a little movie called " @entity218 : breaking @entity219 -- part 1 " surpassed the $ 700 million mark worldwide as well			2
the vampire franchise has proven remarkably consistent			0
underworld awakening -- $ 25.4 million 2			1
@entity54 -- $ 19.1 million 3			1
contraband -- $ 12.2 million 4			1
@entity115 -- $ 10.5 million 5			2
haywire -- $ 9.0 million 6			2
@entity226 -- $ 8.6 million 7			2
@entity227 -- $ 6.1 million 8			2
mission : impossible -- ghost protocol -- $ 5.5 million 9			2
@entity231 : a game of shadows -- $ 4.8 million 10			2
