-- many parents do n't realize that the worst asthma day of the year actually occurs in september			1
clinical studies have shown that greatest number of hospitalizations due to asthma peak 17 days after @entity7 , which in 2013 will be september 19			1
why ? as students return to school , there are a number of external factors , including respiratory allergens , viral infections and environmental irritants that can act together to create a " perfect storm " of asthma triggers			1
to better understand the september phenomenon , we need to better characterize some of the underlying causes			0
outdoor allergens may seem to be the most obvious trigger			1
ragweed , one the largest contributors to upper respiratory symptoms in the @entity26 , produces pollen most aggressively after mid-august			0
however , indoor allergens can be a much more serious issue for patients with asthma			1
schools across the @entity26 contain a number of potential respiratory allergens , including mold , dust mites , pet dander and , in some cases , cockroaches and mice			1
when children switch from a summertime outdoor environment to a climate - controlled indoor environment , overall daily exposure to these allergens can increase and severe symptoms can result			1
what 's in a pollen count anyway ? additionally , even though " flu season " is commonly known as a winter phenomenon , contagious viral infections are spread and shared as much , if not more , in september as they are in january			1
the school week is spent in an enclosed space with hundreds of other children ( many of whom do not have sophisticated hygiene practices ) , which can provide stress to any student 's immune system			2
catching " the common cold " can cause additional problems for a child with asthma			2
many respiratory infections can lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms			1
indoor air particulates such as aerosols , chalk dust and other irritants , can also lead to an increase in asthma symptoms			1
while these irritants may not trigger a true @entity80 allergen response , they can cause rhinitis and other conditions that can exacerbate asthma			2
@entity26 kids have higher allergy risk for patients with allergic asthma , exposure to allergens , infections and irritants can make mid-september a very challenging time			1
in addition , the combination of virus and sensitization with high allergen exposure substantially increases the risk of hospital admission			0
so what can parents do to avoid these asthma triggers ? good preparation includes education			2
during a back - to - school wellness check - up , it 's a good idea for parents to talk with their family clinician about both allergies and asthma if they suspect their child may be experiencing either condition			1
after understanding the history of the symptoms , the clinician may order an allergy blood test to determine if possible allergic triggers are contributing to the asthma and other allergy - like symptoms			2
if testing does identify allergic sensitization , a clinician can then advise parents on how to manage exposure to the allergens			2
the first step in any allergy treatment plan is to avoid exposure as much as possible			0
while it may be almost impossible to remove all dust mites from a school , reducing exposure to them at home is a much more manageable task			0
allergen - proof pillowcase covers can dramatically reduce exposure to dust mites , and since allergy symptoms usually occur because of cumulative exposure , allergen avoidance at night may help a child feel better all day long			0
the same is true for mold and other allergens			0
it may be easier to control mold in the home environment ( bathroom and / or bedroom ) rather than the school environment			0
the key to effectively reducing a patient 's exposure to allergens is to know which triggers to specifically target			0
the " september @entity158 " is coming , but with appropriate preparation and education , it can be managed			0
if you 're unsure about your child 's risk , speak with your doctor about his or her past history and consider testing			0
together you and your family clinician can determine which triggers might affect your child and create a plan to better manage the epidemic			0

asthma hospitalizations peak 17 days after @entity7 , studies show
outdoor and indoor allergens can work together to create " perfect storm " for asthma
contagious viral infections can also play a role when kids go back to school
