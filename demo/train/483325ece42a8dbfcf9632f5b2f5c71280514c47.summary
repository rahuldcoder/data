-- months after her father 's prolonged campaign against president @entity5 's national security policies , @entity1 is spearheading a new organization aimed at organizing conservative opposition to the new administration 's foreign policy approach			1
@entity1 formed keep @entity10 with @entity11 and @entity12			2
the new group , keep @entity10 , says its aim is to provide a cogent and organized rebuttal to a series of recent moves that expressly divert from the more muscular policies of the @entity20 administration			1
the group plans to tackle hot - button issues like the way forward in @entity23 and @entity24 , defense spending , @entity27 interrogation techniques , and the planned closing of the @entity30 detention facility			0
" we have watched with concern and dismay as the @entity5 administration has cut defense spending , wavered on the war in @entity24 , and launched investigations into @entity41 serving on the front lines of the war on terror , while at the same time expanding legal protections for the terrorists that plot to attack this country , " @entity31 , along with the group 's two other founders , wrote on its web site			1
" these policies , along with president @entity5 's abandonment of @entity41 's allies and attempts to appease our adversaries are weakening the nation			2
" weekly standard editor @entity11 and @entity12 , the sister of the pilot of @entity57 -- the flight that crashed into the @entity59 on 9/11 -- are also heading up the new effort			0
the new group says its goal is to focus media attention on continuing and emerging national security threats , and marshal grassroots opposition to the president 's policies			1
" too often , significant events and thoughtful analysis in the war on terror are glossed over or ignored on nightly national newscasts , " the group writes			0
" @entity71 will highlight this information on our website and encourage dialogue between @entity41 citizens and their elected representatives in order to produce the legislative and executive action that will keep this country safe and strong			0
" a spokesman for the @entity83 responded forcefully to the creation of the new group , saying the @entity87 ' foreign policy approach " was deemed a failure			1
" " last fall , the @entity41 people overwhelmingly rejected a radical foreign policy authored by @entity31 that alienated our allies , emboldened our enemies , depleted our resources , distracted our focus and made the nation less secure , " @entity83 press secretary @entity88 said			1
" the @entity87 can continue to focus on securing their sullied legacy if they want to			1
but , the president will continue to focus on securing the country			0
" incorporated as a non-profit 501 ( c ) 4 , the organization is not subject to contribution limits , and is not required to disclose a list of its contributors to the @entity106			0
however , it can not engage in efforts directly aimed at influencing the outcome of an election			0
kicking off a fund - raising drive tuesday , keep @entity10 launched a one - minute , 30 - second web video that portrays @entity5 as a wavering politician whose ambitious foreign policy promises as a candidate have not matched his actions			1
" not enough time for a decision , but plenty of time for @entity121 , golf , a beer summit , more golf , vacation , and a visit to @entity127 , " the video states			0
@entity31 has been no stranger to the media spotlight since the @entity20 administration left office nine months ago			2
regularly appearing on a series of cable news shows , the eldest daughter of former vice president has criticized @entity5 on a host of moves , once concluding that he has " sid [ ed ] with the terrorists			0
" the former vice president has also been a vocal critic of @entity5 , declaring earlier this year that the president 's decision to cease the @entity27 's practice of aggressive interrogation practices has left the country more vulnerable to a terrorist attack .			2
