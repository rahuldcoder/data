-- in case you have n't heard , @entity1 is the @entity5 app that everyone wants to get their grubby little paws on			1
the hip new e-mail app is an alternative interface for @entity11 accounts ( yes , it only works with @entity11 )			1
people who have used it love the gesture - based interface and the ability to " snooze " messages — this latter feature prompts a pop - up message to remind you to reply at some point in the future , like later in the day , later that night , or over the weekend			1
on friday morning , @entity1 announced that it was acquired by @entity24			1
with any luck , that means @entity1 's frustrating rollout policy might be relaxed			2
the app , which debuted in early february 2013 , is so popular that the company has slowed its release through a " reservations " system			2
presumably to stem the crushing demand , @entity1 restricts the number of new accounts that can be activated at a time			2
@entity38 ' @entity37 had to wait roughly five weeks before she moved to the front of the line , and she only recently had her " reservation " activated			0
( i still have about 260,000 people ahead of me			0
) the tiny company 's valuation and the size of the @entity24 deal are still unknown — but the @entity48 notes that @entity1 received $ 5.3 million in 2011 in venture capital			1
" since launching last month , our service capacity has grown 2000x and we 're already delivering more than 60 million emails a day , " the company wrote on its blog			0
" that 's mind - bending growth for only a few weeks , and we 're just getting started			0
" " rather than grow @entity1 on our own , we 've decided to join forces with @entity24 and build it out together , " the company continued			1
" to be clear , @entity1 is not going away			0
the product needs to grow fast , and we believe that joining @entity24 is the best way to make that happen			0

@entity1 , the hot email - management app , has been *purchased* by @entity24
the app , which works with @entity11 , has a waiting list with 100s of *thousands* of people
being bought by the cloud - *storage* company may speed things up
