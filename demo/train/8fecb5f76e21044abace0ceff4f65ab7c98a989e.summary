-- an @entity2 man known as " the @entity3 " was rescued off the coast of @entity5 during a failed attempt to row across the @entity7			1
@entity8 -- whose website says he wants to become the first @entity2 person to row across the ocean -- was hit by a wave monday and " sustained a large laceration , " said @entity14 of the @entity15			1
" he was rescued 206 kilometers ( 128 miles ) off the shore northwest of @entity17 , " @entity14 said tuesday			0
she said a merchant ship picked up @entity8 , who was en route to @entity20 in @entity5 on tuesday			1
" his injuries are not life threatening , so ( he ) will remain on the ship until it docks at @entity20 tomorrow afternoon , " @entity14 said			0
a statement on @entity8 's website -- @entity28 -- says @entity8 was asleep monday night when the force of the wave threw him across the boat 's inner cabin			1
" @entity8 was able to stop the bleeding himself and ... decided to seek help at first light , " the statement said			2
when asked why he decided to attempt the 6,000 - kilometer ( 3,728 - mile ) journey from @entity5 to @entity36 , @entity8 said on his site , " i am a risk taker and risking your life to achieve a dream is the biggest risk you can take			1
some might say it 's foolish but to my mind it is only foolish if you do n't know the risks and you do n't prepare for them and train for every possible scenario			0
" @entity8 is also raising money for @entity52 , which helps provide life - saving treatment , care and support to children and families in @entity59 and @entity60 affected by @entity61 , according to the website			0

" having gotten into a rowing boat for the first time only a year or so beforehand , he will spend 110 days alone at sea , facing 50 foot swells , hurricane force winds and unrelenting sunshine ... and he 'll be naked , " it said			0
why naked ? " as the @entity7 is a very salty environment , clothing tends to become encrusted with salt , " @entity8 said on the site			1
" i will have no means of cleaning this from any clothing at sea , so wearing this clothing when full of salt would lead to severe salt sores on my body which is why i will be naked for most of the journey			2
" @entity14 said she was not sure whether @entity8 was found naked , " nor do i care			2
" @entity0 's @entity87 contributed to this report .			0
