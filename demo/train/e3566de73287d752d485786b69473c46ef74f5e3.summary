-- @entity1 and beaches go together like bossa nova and " @entity4 , " which , of course , put the country on the map as a hub of sun and sand and the eternally tanned and lovely			1
with 4,650 miles of mostly tropical coastline , @entity1 can lay claim to one of the biggest collections of balmy shores on the planet , little of it known outside @entity1			1
from seafronts piled high with dunes and pocked with turquoise pools in the @entity1 states of @entity23 and @entity24 do @entity25 , to the rugged shores of @entity27 , to secluded coves on the southern island of @entity30 , @entity1 's best beaches make the place a shore lover 's nirvana			1
@entity34 take their coastal assets seriously , and beach culture is a big part of the lifestyle			2
beachgoers in @entity40 have been known to break into applause as the sun sets after a particularly fine day of bronzing			0
yes , @entity40 has its share of world - class city beaches , but @entity1 's best beaches , the ones that get you away from it all , are found elsewhere			1
there are dozens of breathtaking stretches of golden sand up and down the long coast of @entity1			1
given that distances are vast and infrastructure not always on the same page you are , let 's narrow the list down to @entity1 's best beaches that you 're most likely to get to without a trekking guide			1
@entity61 , @entity62 , @entity40 most travelers will see their first beaches in @entity40 , which does have some remarkable , if crowded shores			1
of the famed @entity62 beaches , @entity61 is a classic choice			2
if it 's not too crowded , it 's a beautiful stretch of sand , with kiosks to pick up a coconut to down the water from the shell or a caipirinha			2
there 's plenty of scenery along the sand and the jagged pinnacles of the @entity79 that loom up beyond the next beach , @entity81			2
a couple blocks from the water , you can revisit the inspiration for the " @entity4 " with a visit to @entity4 , the cafe where the song was written			0
if your tastes run to fewer tourists , more nature , @entity89 is hidden by the rocky bluffs separating @entity94 from @entity61			0
it 's an isolated cove with wild waves and ( relative ) peace in the middle of chaos			2
@entity100 , @entity101 about an hour south of @entity103 , @entity102 is an unpretentious beach town with a shore you can wander for miles and explore nearby wetlands			1
a couple miles from town , you 'll find one of the most idyllic coastal stretches in @entity1			1
tucked into a grove of palms off a dirt road , @entity111 looks like it escaped from a @entity117 postcard			0
the white sand beach faces a small , lagoon - style bay that 's great for swimming			2
the water is bathtub - warm , and there are no waves to contend with			0
leaning , long - frond palms form a picturesque colonnade down the shoreline			0
watercraft are available for rent , and boat tours of the bay and wetlands are a great way to get to know the area			0
@entity111 's superb natural setting is perfect for a quiet , not chaotic , day at the beach			2
the secret to the tranquility is that @entity111 is a private beach			0
it and the area around it are owned by a single family , which has managed to keep it from being overrun			0
it 's not cheap -- $ 30 a day per car , and the only on - site food is also pricey , but the serenity and scenery are worth it			0
a day at one of @entity1 's best beaches does n't get much more relaxing than this			1
@entity154 , @entity27 with almost 700 miles of coastline , and smack in the tropical zone , the state of @entity27 is loaded with sleepy fishing villages and spectacular beaches			1
one of the best is @entity154 , a hidden beauty 30 miles south of @entity27 's best - known beach site , @entity162			1
there are no vehicles in @entity154 other than the four - legged kind , so the roar you hear is the crashing of waves or mules			0
it was n't that long ago the town did n't even have electricity			0
the beach here goes on for hours , verdant headlands on one side , azure sea on the other			0
though there is n't a lot of commerce around , you can eat tasty seafood , and the trusty mules make sure you 're stocked with beverages			0
there 's a " lost in time " quality about @entity154 , but with beaches this exquisite , that wo n't last for long			2
@entity193 , @entity27 few colors have the power of translucent turquoise to stop humans in their tracks			1
@entity199 has enough of the hue to keep the most jaded traveler enchanted			0
located on the sea side of the @entity204 on the south coast of @entity27 , this beach is a snorkeler 's dream			1
as the tide ebbs , it leaves behind brilliant , turquoise reef pools perfect for viewing an assortment of colorful tropical fish			2
no need for @entity214 here			0
that turquoise is the real deal			0
the beach itself runs broad and golden for some four miles , with thick , luscious palms			2
you wo n't have trouble finding a reasonably priced place to stay , with accommodations from hotels to pousadas to rental houses and campgrounds , or a bar to imbibe near a reef pool			0
it 's easy to make the case for @entity199 as one of @entity1 's best beaches			1
@entity234 , @entity235 , @entity27 in many ways , @entity234 is to @entity235 ( capital of the state of @entity27 ) what @entity239 is to @entity241 and @entity242 is to @entity243			1
tiny fishing boats bring in the day 's catch , there 's beach volleyball and plenty to see at the @entity249 , a traditional fish market in @entity251			1
this is one of the few beaches in the lively city of @entity235 that faces west , so you can catch great sunsets			0
@entity257 , @entity24 do @entity25 a backwater fishing village until backpackers discovered it in the 1970s , @entity257 is a favorite weekend retreat for locals in nearby large cities such as @entity103 and a respected @entity1 stop for global travelers as well			1
a number of international visitors came here and never left , staying on to run small pousadas or restaurants			0
the attractions are obvious -- a beautiful natural setting , with steep pink cliffs rising above the sand and remnants of the great @entity275 that once draped this coast still alive and verdant			0
there 's plenty to do -- surfing , dolphin - watching , sand - boarding			0
at night , @entity257 village is packed with cafes and bars where you can meet and greet and knock back caipirinhas			0
@entity111 do @entity287 , @entity288 , @entity101 often voted @entity1 's best beach , @entity290 do @entity287 is a bay on the island of @entity288 , facing the coast of @entity1 rather than out into the @entity294			1
covered in vegetation , its steep , rocky cliffs form a backdrop to clear waters that are accessible only via ladders attached to the cliff face or by boat			0
@entity302 , @entity101 for those whose tastes run to popular beach resorts , @entity1 has mass tourism sites beyond @entity40 , the biggest including @entity307 and @entity308			1
the most respected major tourist beach in @entity1 is @entity310 , about 45 minutes south of @entity103			1
its lower - key , more eco-centric approach attracts fans on both the independent and mass travel side			0
the beach is a perennial winner of the " best beach in @entity1 " award by readers of " @entity319 " ( " @entity320 " ) , a popular @entity34 travel magazine			1
a former fishing village , @entity302 is famed for its crystalline reef pools , which make for great snorkeling and swimming			2
small sailboats ( jangadas ) take you out to explore the pools , though the most treasured of the pools , which resembles a map of @entity1 , is protected and off - limits			2
@entity302 is the complete package -- a beautiful 11 - mile beach , sailing , windsurfing , diving , kayaking , rafting and restaurants and lodging for all budgets			1
