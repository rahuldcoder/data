-- before this week , @entity2 's hometown was pretty much off the map			0
but @entity2 worked with a group of volunteers who call themselves the @entity6 to walk the streets of @entity8 , @entity9 , over the course of several weeks , pen and pencil in hand , to fill in the details			1
the group uploaded the data they collected to a @entity18 program called @entity19 , and now the maps are freely available online			1
an area of western @entity9 that , according to the @entity23 , contained only two major highways is now digitally dotted with side streets , parks and universities			2
" @entity9 has passed decades of war and misery , but now is the time to rise up and construct the country and develop the abilities for making infrastructure , bringing technologies , being up to date , " @entity2 wrote in an e-mail			2
he added : " @entity9 totally does n't not have any base map on the @entity37 , except old satellite imagery with a very low quality			1
since we started our works we could finish @entity8 , which is one of major cities in @entity9 , and now @entity8 has a complete base map over the @entity37			1
" @entity18 announced thursday that the efforts of volunteers like @entity2 have led to several previously uncharted countries and territories being mapped online			1
they are : @entity9 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
@entity18 describes its " @entity19 " project this way : " these citizen cartographers help keep maps of their areas accurate and up to date			1
they add missing roads and new businesses -- and even map areas that have little to no data yet on @entity69			1
" the company praised @entity2 's efforts in conjunction with other volunteers and a university : " striking for its charm , bustle and impressive historic architectural treasures , the silk road city of @entity8 , @entity9 has until today , been nearly ' invisible ' online in digital maps			1
luckily , @entity8 is home to @entity80 , which is filled with talented , entrepreneurial students some of whom have worked together to literally put their town ' on the ( digital ) map , ' " @entity18 wrote in a blog post			1
the company added : " this story is far more significant than the mapping of a city			0
it is a story of young people in a community coming together , taking ownership of their future and serving their country in a truly entrepreneurial and meaningful way			0
" you can watch the changes emerge in this time - lapse videos on @entity100 , including one of the mapping progression in @entity8			0
and here 's some interesting background on maps in @entity106 , @entity9 , from the @entity107 : " at one of @entity106 's @entity111 distribution centres , i saw more than 30 private and official letters			2
none had an exact address - just a series of vague directions			0
one , which had been sent from @entity118 , simply states , ' @entity119 , behind @entity121 palace			0
' " it underscores the impact of maps			0
they help a country function			0
for @entity2 , this project was about much more than cartography			0
he hopes to help map the rest of @entity9			2
" it has always been my honor to help the country , which had nothing but war , " he said			0
" this is my home ... and we are all hoping one day ( to ) have a peaceful country with great honors and glories over the world			0
" the special thing for me is to make known the unknown ( in ) @entity9			2

volunteers in *remote* countries are uploading data to @entity69
the efforts are helping @entity18 map parts of the world with new details
maps were recently uploaded from @entity9 , @entity49 and @entity56
