the first time you see this bizarre aircraft floating high above the horizon , you may be confused			0
it looks kind of like a giant , winged doughnut			0
it 's 35 feet wide , and inventors call it the @entity10			1
it 's an unmanned , helium - filled , cylindrical blimp wrapped around three spinning blades that turn wind into electricity			1
can the @entity10 , which stands for buoyant airborne turbine , help bring life - saving electricity to an estimated 1 billion people in rural areas where power is unavailable ? @entity20 , launched four years ago by a group of @entity23 grads , hopes so			1
the young company is competing with @entity25 and other outfits trying to bring the first viable airborne wind turbine to market			1
the sight of whirling wind turbine blades sitting atop towers has become common in states such as @entity33 and @entity34 and in @entity35			2
but the @entity10 takes wind turbine technology to the next level , literally -- about 1,000 feet above the ground			1
towers are often too low to catch the best winds			0
by flying remote - controlled wind turbines where winds are stronger and more consistent , a lot more energy can be harvested , and it 's clean energy from an endless source			1
it 's a dramatic idea that could change the course of countless lives around the planet			2
suddenly , with airborne wind turbines , isolated communities in @entity54 jungles or @entity56 islands could have easier , cheaper access to technology that most take for granted			1
for those people , the cost of electric light and heat would plummet because fossil fuels for electric generators would n't have to be imported			0
electricity would be available to pump clean water from central wells , preventing waterborne diseases			2
refrigeration would be possible in hot climates to keep food fresh and store life - saving prescription drugs			2
even cell phone communications might be possible in some places , if cellular repeaters could be integrated into the high - flying turbines			1
experts offer three reasons why airborne wind turbines might work for remote areas : they 're portable			2
they 're computer controlled , requiring no onboard pilots and few operators			0
no expensive infrastructure , such as electrical grids or power stations , is required			0
so now , the race is on to figure out the best design for these aerial power generators			1
would it look like an airplane ? @entity25 - owned @entity94 in @entity33 is working on one			1
or would it look more like a winged blimp ? a firm out of @entity98 called @entity99 is working on that idea			0
perhaps the answer will be a huge kite , such as they 've got at @entity105 - based @entity104			2
or maybe the @entity10 will do the trick			1
@entity20 and the @entity107 in @entity108 , @entity56 , are planning to partner on an 18 - month test run , beginning sometime in 2015			1
electricity in some remote parts of @entity56 can cost more than four times the @entity113 average of 13.4 cents per kilowatt hour			1
that 's because many @entity56 communities are far from electrical power grids -- the infrastructure networks that connect electricity to consumers			1
without a grid , the cost of hauling in fossil fuels to run electric generators is huge			0
" in @entity56 , we have a very small electrical grid , " said @entity126 systems manager @entity125			1
" when people live away from that , they generate their own power in all these villages , and that 's pretty expensive			2
" the @entity10 , @entity135 says , is portable enough to pack into two small shipping containers			1
it can be set up without heavy machinery in about a day			0
the thing flies via its helium - filled doughnut - shaped body			1
it 's connected to the ground at all times by strong tethers , which carry electricity to a portable ground station			1
the tethers also are connected to a computer - controlled automated system that optimizes the @entity10 's height , based on changing winds			1
during operation , no crew is required , @entity20 says			1
it can be monitored remotely and maintained with periodic on - site inspections			0
the ground station can be connected to a power grid , or a local micro-grid , or customer equipment , @entity20 says			1
each bat can crank out enough power for 12 homes , the company says			0
during dangerous weather , the @entity10 is designed to reel itself down to the ground			1
its spinning blades do n't pose a significant threat to birds and bats , @entity20 says , because critters do n't usually fly as high as the turbines			2
and what about nearby airplanes ? existing federal rules allow the @entity10 to fly nearly 2,000 feet high , below most flight patterns			2
the turbines include safety lights and locator beacons to warn passing aircraft			0
here 's a brief look at the @entity10 's competitors : @entity25 's @entity180 turbine the @entity181 got its name from the @entity184 word for wind			1
this turbine differs from the @entity10 because it flies more like an airplane			1
the plane has propellers on its wing and launches from a nearby ground station tower			0
while tethered to the tower , the @entity180 continuously circles in a vertical loop while it generates electricity			0
when it 's finished , the @entity180 flies itself back to the tower			0
development of the @entity180 started with inflatable fabric kites			0
but five years ago , engineers switched to a more reliable rigid airframe made from lightweight carbon fiber			0
the commercial turbine now under development has the wingspan of an airliner and the weight of a @entity209 , and it can withstand the g - forces of a fighter jet , @entity180 says			0
the kite @entity213 's @entity104 , founded in 2010 , is developing a wind turbine that flies on a kite			2
" it will be a mono - wing , like a kite rather than an airplane , " said co-founder and ceo @entity216			2
the design calls for the kite to be controlled by a bridle and connected by tethers to a ground station			0
@entity216 says he expects to begin product sales in 2016			0
the @entity228 in @entity230 , @entity99 's @entity228 concept is basically a blimp with wings and two spinning propellers			0
what sets this idea apart is the type of buoyant gas that would allow it to fly : hydrogen			0
company founder and ceo @entity240 acknowledges that using hydrogen , which is more flammable than helium , " is potentially dangerous			0
" however , he said , " we have to decide what would be sufficient to mitigate the risk			0
" a specially designed envelope surrounding the hydrogen would protect the gas from igniting			0
also , @entity240 says that hydrogen is cheaper than helium and can be created on - site			2
" you can electrolyze water using some of your own electrical output from the generator , " he said			0
it 's possible that all of these technologies may eventually find a place in the growing wind turbine landscape			2
if the concept of flying wind turbines fulfills its promise , by the end of the decade innovators may transform this big idea into reality while ushering some of the world 's most isolated communities into the 21st century .			1

engineers race to develop unmanned flying machine that turns wind to electricity
@entity20 ' helium - filled @entity10 may start @entity56 field tests in 2015
@entity25 's @entity181 uses an airplane - like design
worldwide , an estimated 1 billion rural *residents* have no access to electricity
