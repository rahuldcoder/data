-- august 19 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : fridays are awesome on @entity17 ! so is a story we have coming up on a @entity21 officer			1
we 're starting today in the @entity25			1
first up : @entity4 conflict @entity27 : pressure is increasing for @entity4 's president , @entity29 , to quit his job			1
we 've talked this week about the violence going on in @entity4 and the protests there against the country 's leader			1
yesterday , @entity37 officials explained why they believe the @entity4 president 's got to go			1
@entity37 secretary of state hillary clinton : the people of @entity4 deserve a government that respects their dignity , protects their rights , and lives up to their aspirations			1
@entity29 is standing in their way			1
@entity27 : the @entity37 also announced new sanctions -- new punishments -- against the @entity4 government			1
those include limiting access to assets that @entity4 has in the @entity37			1
president @entity29 is also facing heat from @entity55 leaders			1
@entity56 , @entity57 , the @entity58 , the @entity59 : all of them calling for him to step aside			1
@entity62 @entity63 , @entity15 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a stock index that was established in 1896			1
most people use me to measure the overall @entity37 stock market			1
i was founded by @entity70 and @entity71			1
i 'm the @entity72 , and i 'm made up of 30 high - profile stocks			2
economic concerns @entity27 : the @entity72 is highlighting concerns about the @entity37 economy			2
yesterday , it dropped more than 400 points			2
at one point during the day , it was down nearly 530 points			1
that came after @entity83 -- this major investment bank -- put out a prediction that was pretty negative about economic growth around the globe			2
so the @entity72 took a big drop			2
so what ? what does that mean ? well , the @entity72 indicates not just how major companies are doing , but how investors feel about the economy in general			2
and if that is dropping , that means investors are pulling money out of the market			2
they 're not feeling confident in it			2
and this does n't just affect the @entity37 there 's a global economy			1
what happens in one country affects other countries			2
and that 's what we 're seeing			1
stock markets in @entity55 and @entity111 took a hit yesterday , as well			2
battle for @entity113 @entity27 : the stock market is one way people determine how the @entity37 economy is doing			2
another is the national unemployment rate			2
right now , it 's just over nine percent			1
everyone wants to create new jobs			2
but president @entity123 and the @entity125 candidates who are hoping to be the next president do n't agree on how to do that			2
@entity128 has more on that			2
( begin video ) @entity131 , @entity17 national correspondent : wrapping up a three - day midwest tour in his home state of @entity6 , president @entity123 held a town hall meeting at a production facility , where he focused on jobs while fighting to keep his			1
he said by starting with basic ideas , like building the nation 's infrastructure , the economy will move in the right direction if @entity143 does not get in the way			1
@entity37 president @entity123 : these are n't radical ideas			2
i mean building roads , when did that become a partisan issue ? @entity151 : many feel political bickering in @entity143 is taking focus away from the real needs of the country			2
@entity157 : we 've lost our rating as far as being able to borrow money			2
@entity151 : meanwhile in @entity5 , @entity162 claimed the president 's inexperience was responsible for the economic crisis and subsequent standstill in @entity167			1
@entity162 , ( r ) presidential candidate : as far as i can tell , he did n't lead a business , did n't lead a state , did n't lead a city			2
he did n't have leadership experience and therefore did n't know how to work with @entity143			2
@entity151 : also campaigning in @entity5 , @entity125 hopeful @entity174 continued to tout his record of job creation as governor of @entity7 and criticized the president for what he called his inability to manage the economy			2
@entity174 , ( r ) presidential candidate : we spent the last 2.5 years in a grand experiment with the @entity37 economy , and it has been a terrible , terrible disaster			0
@entity151 : according to @entity187 officials , president @entity123 will address job growth and the nation 's debt with a new economic plan some time after @entity192			1
in @entity167 , i 'm @entity128			0
( @entity194 ) billion @entity195 @entity27 : talking ' bout the weather			0
so far this year , we 've seen some extreme weather events : floods , blizzards , tornadoes			0
you hear a lot about the lives that are lost , the damage that happens			0
but there 's a cost to all that damage , too			1
@entity209 is here to take us through some of this year 's costliest weather events			1
@entity212 , can you start with the total ? ( begin video ) @entity215 , @entity216 : @entity24 , believe it or not , @entity218 now estimates $ 35 billion -- with a b -- in lost revenues , lost crops , just basicaly lost money over the @entity37 from severe weather alone this season			0
let 's take a look at the top nine			1
the first one , $ 9 billion : the tornadoes that rolled through @entity229 , especially @entity230 , just north of @entity231 and even into @entity232 that night			0
seven billion dollars from the tornadoes that hit , including @entity233 , @entity234 , that leveled part of that town ; $ 7 billion and 177 people dead			0
five - and - a - half billion dollars just because of the droughts in the @entity239 , especially @entity7 and @entity240			0
some spots drier than the @entity242			0
four billion dollars with the spring and summer floods of the @entity244 , all the way down the @entity244 into the @entity245			0
and then a couple of them all rounded up here , from the @entity250 tornadoes , that 's including parts of @entity229 , @entity7 and even into the @entity253			1
and then april 11 , $ 2.2 billion , no deaths , but that was the @entity256 event there			0
the @entity259 blizzard : two feet of snow in parts of @entity262			0
then the upper @entity250 flooding , that 's in the @entity265			1
in fact , that 's still going right now			1
hard to believe , $ 35 billion in losses , @entity24			0
( @entity194 ) @entity269 @entity27 : thank you , @entity212			0
one of the things you heard @entity212 mention was the drought in @entity7			0
this has been going on for 10 months			0
it was made worse by a blazing hot summer			0
officials are looking at some of the industries that will feel the biggest effects of this			0
producers have lost an estimated $ 2.1 billion			0
@entity286 , next on the list			0
around $ 1.8 billion lost there			0
this drought is affecting people who produce hay , corn and wheat , as well			0
the state 's agriculture commissioner said the numbers are n't good			1
but he added that @entity7 farmers and ranchers will adapt and overcome the drought			0
@entity299 @entity300 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! in the @entity21 , what is the official name for a one - star general ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it a : a ) brigadier general , b ) major general , c ) lieutenant general or @entity312 ) @entity310 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! all of these ranks are addressed as " general , " but a brigadier general wears one star			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity319 @entity27 : that 's the rank general @entity319 holds right now			1
but she 's been nominated to get another star and possibly be promoted to major general			1
it 's impressive for someone who , back in college , never thought she 'd go into the military			1
@entity327 sat down for @entity17 's " @entity331 " interview series to talk about how she got to where she is			1
( begin video ) brigadier general @entity319 , @entity333 : my husband would say that i could talk to a pole , and i do tend to make friends in movie lines buying tickets			0
when women enlist in the military , i think they should expect to be challenged			0
they are going to put you in charge of some people besides yourself			0
they are going to make you responsible for resources			0
you are going to have to mentor those people			0
my nomination and hopefully my confirmation to major general , i will be the first @entity352 - @entity37 female in the @entity21 to have achieved that rank			0
the biggest pivotal moment in life : the look on my dad 's face -- and i 'm going to get a little teary here -- the look on my dad 's face when he got to promote me to brigadier general			1
he served in the @entity364 at a time when they just were integrating the military			0
i know he could have been anything , but because of that time , perhaps he did n't get to achieve as much as he could have			0
i think the biggest " a-ha " moment was when i graduated from high school			0
the world just seemed really bright and i just kind of felt as if anything was possible			0
i just wanted to be the kind of person that , when i passed away , people would say , " she tried to treat people the right way			0
" that would leave me with a really good feeling and i think a really good legacy			0
( @entity194 ) before we go @entity27 : a valet parks your car			0
but at this golf course , the valet might bark at it , too ! just another day on the job for @entity391			1
she 's a six - year - old dog who helps out the golfers			1
when they finish a round and drop off their carts , they leave the keys with @entity391 and she brings ' em back to the clubhouse			0
so , if you call the person who carries your clubs a caddy , what do you call the dog who gets your keys ? goodbye @entity27 : a retriever , of course			0
she just does that all day long ; does n't go out to the holes			1
she puts the cart before the course ! we look fore ! - ward to seeing you next week for more @entity0			1
have a good one .			0
