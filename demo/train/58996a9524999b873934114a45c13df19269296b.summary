-- when animal control officers were called to a @entity4 , @entity5 , neighborhood to pick up a wandering pit bull on a cold monday in december , they did n't expect a mystery to unfold			1
but inside a fold of the dog 's collar , they found a wrinkled black - and - white photo			1
it had no name or date			0
a smiling man seated on a railing looks straight into the camera -- but , beyond that , the photo offers no clues			1
the friendly tan canine , now named soldier because the man in the photo may be wearing a military uniform , was skinny but well - behaved , said @entity25 , community relations coordinator with @entity26			1
he was not neutered or microchipped			0
@entity25 said the collar itself is n't old , which reduces the chances it was placed there long ago and forgotten			2
" it 's so bizarre , " she said			2
" absolutely anything is possible			0
" after the photo was posted to the shelter 's @entity38 page , a few people tried to offer clues about the photo , but nothing substantial has surfaced			1
@entity25 hopes a wider exposure will lead them to the owner , or at least help solve the mystery			0
" this photo should mean something to somebody , " @entity25 said			0
even if the owner is n't found , the dog is available for adoption			1
because the shelter has limited space , it 's possible that soldier could be euthanized if he is n't adopted , @entity25 said			1
interest in soldier makes that unlikely , she said thursday			0
this is n't the first odd case the shelter has encountered			0
years ago , @entity25 said , a dog was found wandering the parking lot wearing a cape			2
anyone with information about soldier is encouraged to contact @entity26 at @entity67			0
@entity69 photos found @entity71 photos found at garage sale still a mystery			2

a stray pit bull was found in @entity5
animal shelter *workers* discovered an old photo in the dog 's collar
the man in the photo , and his *connection* to the dog , remain a mystery
