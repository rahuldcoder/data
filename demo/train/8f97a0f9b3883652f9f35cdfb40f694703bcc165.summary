the university said law enforcement officials confirmed that @entity19 neuroscientist @entity18 received a package at his home containing razor blades and a threatening note			1
the @entity24 posted an unsigned communique on its website from a group calling itself " the @entity28 at @entity19 , " claiming its members sent the razor blades to @entity18 because he uses primates for government - funded testing of drug addiction			1
" he has no business addicting primates to phencyclidine known on the streets as @entity42 and other street drugs using grant money from the federal government , " said the statement issued tuesday by the activist group			1

@entity18 , a professor of psychology , psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences , uses vervet monkeys in his research into the biochemical processes that contribute to methamphetamine addiction and tobacco dependence in teenagers , and the cognitive disabilities affecting schizophrenia patients , according to the university			1
much of @entity18 's work is funded by the @entity77 , university officials said			2

usually the threats are general , this one was very specific			2

it was the first sign something was nefarious , " he said			0
" the letter inside contained quite specific and heinous acts of violence to kill me			0
" he said the letter was signed by the @entity28 , which he described as a group " loosely aligned with the @entity128			1
" " the major reason [ no one has been arrested ] is because the @entity128 has no official membership			1
their spokesman calls from underground and claims to not know any of its members , " @entity18 said			0
@entity137 , an animal rights activist , said he does not know who targeted @entity18 but he says he understands why the researcher was targeted			2

try to look at it from the perspective of the innocent beings that he is doing this to , " @entity137 said			0
@entity137 says he is a medical doctor who also used to do animal research but stopped because he felt it was incredibly torturous to animals			2
