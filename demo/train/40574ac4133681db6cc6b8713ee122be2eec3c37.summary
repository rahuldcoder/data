it was dedicated " to any kid that 's ever had a long walk home by yourself			0
" @entity62 's recording partners @entity86 and @entity7 got the @entity88 crowd on their feet with a rap performance that the television audience did not get to completely hear			1
the censor cut frequent expletives in their lyrics , leaving viewers to hear a song punctuated with frequent silent gaps			0
@entity7 , who entered on a skateboard , ended with a dive off the stage			0
in contrast , singer @entity101 delivered the most subtle performance of the night with a rendition of his " @entity105			0
