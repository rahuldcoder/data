-- all day long , @entity1 looked forward to her favorite weekday ritual : putting the kids to bed , changing her clothes , and pouring herself a generous glass of @entity7			1
" my friends and i joke that motherhood ' drives us to drink , ' but sometimes it really does for me , " she said			2
" i feel like i need it to unwind , " she said			2
most nights she had three or four glasses , though never , she insisted , more than that			0
" and on nights that i do n't have it , " she said , " i really wish that i did			2
" for a long time , @entity1 saw nothing wrong with her drinking			2
it did n't interfere with her parenting , or her relationships			2
she got done what she needed to get done			0
but lately , @entity1 had been starting to wonder about her daily habit -- looking as forward to it as she did , and the anxiety that consumed her when she could not have it left her feeling unsettled			0
part of her concern related to a history of alcoholism in her family			0
" my father was an alcoholic , and i always have in the back of my head this idea that i could become one , too ; it 's in my genes , " she said			0
although men have historically been heavier drinkers than women , there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the gender gap is shrinking , and fast			1
according to the @entity47 , more @entity46 women are drinking more heavily than ever before : one in eight women binge drink -- defined as four drinks or more in one sitting -- about three times a month			1
a forthcoming study in the october 2013 issue of the journal @entity56 : clinical and @entity58 found that college - aged women are drinking more often than their male counterparts , confirming a january 2013 study of college students in @entity63 found female students were more likely to binge drink than male students			1
the @entity67 reports that arrests for women driving while drunk are on the rise , by about 30 % from 1998 to 2007			1
and according to the @entity47 , white , college - educated woman ages 18 to 24 with $ 75,000 or more annual household income were more likely to binge drink than women of other races , ages , and socioeconomic categories			1
part of this rise in alcohol consumption may have something to do with young people staying single longer ; presumably women are out socializing more often than women their age were likely to do 20 years ago			1
they 're also working more , and drinking is often part of the job in male - dominated industries , like banking and tech. a study that appeared in the december 2011 issue of @entity56 : @entity94 , which tracked alcohol consumption in those born after @entity97 , suggested that the move toward gender equality may correlate with higher drinking rates			1
this suggests that more women have the opportunity , and the pressure , to socialize for work and " drink like men			1
" after all , although the three - martini lunch is a " @entity110 " - era relic , alcohol undoubtedly still plays a key role in many work functions			2
entertaining clients is one way colleagues compete , while after - work socializing is an ever - important part of the professional culture			2
many who do n't participate in the interoffice networking often feel left out of the group , or even suffer professionally			0
and yet women with careers are n't the only ones getting a bigger buzz than ever before			1
a @entity127 study found that , surprisingly , married women actually drink slightly more than their single counterparts			1
@entity130 , a stay - at - home mother , began to drink more frequently after having her third child			0
she was often drinking alone , because her husband traveled a lot for work			1
" my social life is just so restricted ; i 'm home every night , " she said			0
" i used to have an active social life			0
now , most of my evenings are about feeding kids , cleaning kids , putting them to bed -- and then collapsing in front of the tv			0
" sometimes , she said , having a drink was a way to remember some of the excitement of her old life			0
other times , it was just something to do			0
@entity130 certainly is n't unique and , in fact , there 's been a movement toward a certain acceptance -- in some cases even glorification -- of mothers who drink			1
@entity168 groups like " @entity169 " and " @entity159 of wine or i 'm going to sell my kids " have tens of thousands of fans , inspiring one winemaker to create a label of wine especially for stressed - out moms			1
" put your kids to bed , " the label for @entity174 reads , " and have a glass of @entity176			0
" though meant , as a concept , to relieve mothers of the pressure to be perfect , the promotion , even half - seriously , of alcohol as an escape , something deserved as a reward for a long day of parenting , has helped make evident the biggest issue of all : that many women do n't realize what problem drinking looks , or feels , like			1
like @entity1 , many problem drinkers will never find themselves hitting " rock bottom " or facing any sort of trouble			0
instead , they may experience far more prosaic effects , which prevent them , and their family and friends , from recognizing their over-consumption			0
a recent @entity203 study of more than 22,000 people published in the @entity205 found that the average woman underreports her weekly drinking by 60 % , and that up to 80 % of women exceed the recommended daily intake			1
are they alcoholics ? it 's hard to say			0
but if you believe that alcoholism is defined by a preoccupation with drinking , a steady increase in the amount you need to drink in order to get the same effect , and an inability to give it up -- and most in the medical profession do -- then more and more women fit the profile quite nicely , though often come to the realization on their own			1
" my husband only ever commented on the number of bottles in the recycling , " said @entity1 , who eventually quit drinking altogether			0
" he 'd be like , ' you drank all that ? but you were n't drunk at all ! ' except , looking back , i sort of was			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			2
