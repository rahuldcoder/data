@entity0 -- for the past week , members of @entity4 's armed forces have been taking part in major exercises to prepare for the @entity7 in @entity0 later this summer			1
alongside the emergency drills and simulated alarms , designed to ready the city for potential terror threats to the @entity13 , soldiers have also practiced launching missiles from the city 's rooftops			1
the residents of an exclusive apartment complex in @entity0 's @entity19 were horrified to discover that the @entity4 @entity20 planned to site ground - to - air rocket launchers from the roof of their homes			1
now one historian has called on them to channel the spirits of the factory workers who once worked where they now live , and insist that the missiles are removed			1
today @entity29 is an upscale gated community , complete with swimming pool , gymnasium , private gardens and its own restaurant , bar and shop			2
makeup artist @entity36 , who has lived in the complex for 18 months , told @entity1 she was attracted to the complex by its air of security -- but now fears the missiles will mean her home becomes a terrorist target			1
" i 'm frightened of getting my head blown off , " she said			2
" i moved here because it 's a gated community and it made me feel safe , but now it feels like we 're living inside some military compound			2
they say it 's going to make us safe , but in fact it 's going to make us a target			1
they 're going to convert a residential area into a war zone			0
" and security guard @entity58 , who lives opposite @entity29 , agreed : " if terrorists are a threat , this is now the first place they 're going to come			1
also , if something attacks us from the sky and they shoot it down , where is it going to land ? this is a residential neighborhood , loads of families , loads of kids			0
it just does n't make any sense bringing missile launchers here			1
" the @entity20 says it chose @entity29 because " it is situated close to the @entity78 and offers an excellent view of the surrounding area , and the entire sky above the @entity78			1
" it says the ground - to - air missile system " is operated by fully trained and experienced soldiers , " and insists " it does not pose any hazard to residents , " adding that the missiles will be guarded 24 hours a day by a team of military personnel and police			1
for many of those living inside the high walls and security gates , what annoys them most is that no - one asked their opinion			0
@entity99 , @entity29 resident and one of the journalists who broke the story of the missiles , told @entity1 : " in a @entity104 democracy in 2012 , i do n't think the army should occupy private land without consulting the people who live there and getting their consent			2
" people are grown - ups , they understand that the @entity7 need to be protected , but there are questions : do the missiles make us a target ? if they are fired , where does the debris fall ? and who pays for any damage caused ? " @entity29 was not always so glamorous and gentrified			1
the site was once home to the @entity125 match factory , notorious for the horrific working conditions inside its walls -- until , that is , the mainly female workers rose up and demanded action , and changed @entity4 society for good in the process			1
the " match girls " at @entity125 were paid a pittance -- less than five shillings a week -- and those earnings were frequently whittled away by a system of fines imposed for " offenses " including talking , lateness , talking , and dropping matches			1
in addition , the dangerous white phosphorous they worked with on a daily basis made them very sick , @entity147 , historian and author of " striking a @entity150 : the @entity151 and @entity152 and their place in @entity156 history , " told @entity1			1
many were in poor health because of their work , left bald from carrying heavy boxes on their heads and suffering the horrific industrial disease known as " phossy jaw " -- the necrosis of their jaw bones caused by the white phosphorus used in the matches			0
" they were physically very frail , " @entity170 said			0
" they were working in the factory from the age of 10 or 11 -- sometimes even younger			2
their growth was stunted , they were malnourished , and the phosphorus made them really ill. " it 's terrible stuff : back then people used it to commit suicide or to cause abortions , and these women were working with it everyday			0
it made them really sick			0
the average life expectancy was just 25			0
" disgusted by working conditions at the factory , feminist and social campaigner @entity191 wrote a crusading article , " @entity196 in @entity0 " which brought the suffering of the match girls to a wider audience			1
they were , she wrote : " undersized because under - fed , oppressed because helpless , flung aside as soon as worked out			0
who cares if they die or go on the streets provided only that @entity151 & may shareholders get their 23 %			0
" @entity151 and may were furious , but when they tried to force the workers to sign a statement insisting they were happy with their treatment , the matchmakers refused , and when one of their number was fired , they walked out			0
but despite the match girls ' lowly status , the resulting strike garnered the backing of high - profile supporters including playwright @entity214 , and led to a boycott of the company 's products			1
" the match women were the lowest of the low , " said @entity170			2
" they were a wild and wonderful bunch : factory girls , working class , they were loud and dressed in colorful clothes -- they really had polite @entity224 society reaching for the smelling salts			1
" in contrast , @entity151 and may were big , powerful men , and yet they had to give in to them			0
" within weeks , the company reluctantly accepted the strikers ' demands for improved pay and conditions , an end to the system of fines			0
the match girls went on to found the first union for female workers in @entity4 , and their actions helped shape the modern @entity156 movement			1
that a location of such importance to workers ' rights should be the site of " undemocratic " actions today is not lost on those who live there -- or their supporters			0
@entity252 user @entity251 ( @ @entity253 ) was among those quick to point out the irony : " laughable that @entity256 was the site of emancipation in the past , but authoritarian control today , is this the spirit of the games ? " @entity147 said the match women should be an inspiration to those at @entity29 who were unhappy at the @entity20 's decision			1
" it is such @entity151 and may - like behaviour to stick missiles on the roof without asking , " she told @entity1			2
" the match women would n't have stood for it			2
they were , in theory , completely powerless in the face of authority -- nobody thought they could change anything , but they stood together and they did change things -- they had a huge influence			0
" it was a victory for people power , and they are an example to us all			0
" but @entity99 said he doubted that the residents would take action in quite the same way			2
" i wish i could tell you i think there will be a @entity29 uprising , a @entity291 over this , but i doubt it			0
" in reality , people are very concerned , and they have questions which will need to be answered			0
if they are not , then people will try to stop it			0
" @entity1 's @entity298 contributed to this report .			0
