-- the man who once indignantly remarked , " i 'm a fascist , not a racist , " has publicly disavowed his past far - right statements after the storm of controversy that has followed his appointment as manager of an @entity11 soccer team			1
@entity13 's decision to hire @entity14 at the weekend has left the club and the @entity16 facing a barrage of questions about his past , when he has admitted being " fascinated " by his country 's former dictator @entity20			1
he even has tattoos of fascist emblems			2
his new club 's vice-chairman , prominent politician @entity24 , stepped down as soon as the announcement was made			1
at first @entity14 refused to respond , saying he would only talk about football - related matters			1
however , following widespread media pressure , protests from local war veterans , anti-racism groups , a leading church member from @entity34 's north - east region whose mother was a @entity36 refugee , and several @entity38 pages , the 44 - year - old has released a statement to clarify his beliefs			1
" i feel that i should not have to continually justify myself to people who do not understand this , however i will say one thing only -- i am not the man that some people like to portray , " @entity14 said in a statement on @entity13 's website on wednesday			1
" i am not political , i do not affiliate myself to any organization , i am not a racist and i do not support the ideology of fascism			0
" @entity14 was once a member of a hardcore right - wing fan group that follows his hometown team @entity56 -- the club where he started his career and later got into trouble when he returned , when he made straight - arm salutes to the crowd in 2005			2
at the time he was praised by members of @entity20 's family , but the football authorities fined him and suspended him for one match			0
@entity56 , meanwhile , has been charged four times this season over the racist behavior of its fans			0
the decision by @entity13 's @entity72 owner @entity71 to hire a man with such a controversial past was seen by many as being at odds with the club 's strong family values			1
its work with children in the community helped secure a sponsorship deal with the " @entity85 " group and also led to a partnership with the @entity87			0
both have said that @entity14 's appointment will not affect their relationship with @entity13 , while several fan groups told @entity0 tuesday that they supported his arrival			1
" it is a football - related matter and under the remit of the club , " an invest in @entity95 spokesman told the @entity97 @entity96			0
the @entity102 charity , whose partnership was publicly launched at a high - profile home match against @entity105 on saturday , met with @entity14 and club officials on monday			2
" at the heart of the partnership is a commitment to our founder 's values with a special focus on human rights and anti-racism , " it said in a statement tuesday			2
" at the meeting on monday , @entity13 reaffirmed its commitment to these values and the ethos of the partnership			2
" @entity14 is now hoping to focus on the task of keeping @entity13 in the top division , in what is only his second managerial role after less than two years at @entity127 -- a club he took from the fourth tier of the @entity34 game to the third before quitting over its financial problems			1
his new team is just one point above the relegation zone with seven games to play ahead of his first match in charge -- sunday 's trip to fourth - placed @entity139			0
" i have clearly stated that i do not wish to speak about matters other than football , however , i have been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club , " he said wednesday			0
" this is a historic , proud and ethical club and to read and hear some of the vicious and personal accusations is painful			0
i am an honest man , my values and principles come from my family and my upbringing			0
" now i will speak only of football			0
