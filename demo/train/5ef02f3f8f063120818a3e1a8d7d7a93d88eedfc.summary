@entity0 -- crowded , gritty , and poor , @entity0 can be a tough place to live for just about anyone ; but when you stand three feet 10 inches the odds are seriously stacked against you			1
" i come from the provinces so there was no work , " says 35 - year - old @entity5 , looking at his hands			2
" farm work , using the heavy equipment , was just too hard for me			0
" arriving in @entity0 as a 21 - year - old , @entity5 - a dwarf or unano as they are called in the @entity14 - tried his hand at several jobs , among them working as a show wrestler in a @entity0 bar			1
" that was okay but it could be quite hard , " he says			0
" it was just a show , and just on thursdays , but sometimes you could still get hurt and you were always slipping over in the oil			0
" now safely ensconced in @entity0 's " @entity25 " - a dwarf - themed blues bar in @entity0 's scruffy @entity28 district - he is part of a group of dwarves who plan to build their own community for about 30 of the city 's " little people " - the preferred term for people with dwarfism			1
often isolated in the provinces , where they can be the only person in the town with dwarfism , in @entity0 they are less visible			1
working and living together , however , makes the condition all but a normal state of affairs			0
the founder of the @entity25 , 71 - year - old @entity47 , says dwarves in the @entity14 suffer the same amount of prejudice as little people anywhere else in the world			1
" i think anywhere ... anywhere in the world they 'd have the same problems , " says @entity47 sitting in his usual corner of the bar , a cigarette burning in his ashtray			0
" people look and stare at them , " he says , screwing up his face in imitation of someone who 's just seen something weird			2
far from exploiting the dwarves , @entity47 maintains the bar gives hope and employment to people who sometimes hail from the worst slums in @entity0			1
" it gives them a real sense of community , " he says , taking a draw on his cigarette			0
a former @entity81 volunteer who came to @entity0 in the 60s , @entity47 later worked in @entity14 television in the 1970s when dwarves and transvestites were a staple fare of the film industry			1
the exploitation genre - a period during the 60s , 70s and 80s when sexism , racism and so - called " carnival freaks " were regarded as a surefire recipe for a box office smash - was recently documented in an @entity96 film released last year called @entity97 ! the b - movie genre was designed as drive - in fodder and involved @entity100 © scenes featuring gun - toting nuns , topless female revolutionaries or martial arts - performing dwarves			2
the low - budget films launched the career of @entity14 actor and martial artist @entity110 - better known as @entity110 - who stood just 2 feet , 9 inches tall			2
starring in roles as diverse as the baby @entity112 in a @entity14 biblical epic to a spoof on @entity115 where he appeared as agent ' 00 ' , @entity110 was wildly popular in the @entity14 in a genre that became know as ' dwarf tv '			1
@entity47 became friends with several people with dwarfism and , combined with his love of @entity125 's @entity124 , the idea for the @entity25 was born			1
it has since become so popular that he opened up a second @entity25 in the beach resort of @entity129 and the venues now attract a steady stream of little people looking for work			1
" at first we were just taking anyone we could get , but now we 're pretty much turning people away , " he said			0
the bar general manager @entity137 , who started at the @entity25 as a cashier but now operates the bar , says they are now looking for dwarves who have good @entity143 and even college degrees			1
" a few of the people we 've hired have n't worked out , " adds @entity47			0
the @entity25 is still the first stop for casting agents looking for little people to star as extras and most of the staff at the bar describe themselves as freelancers or businesspeople			1
not only does the bar provide regular employment between gigs , it also gives the staff a chance to hone their skills - the @entity25 has spawned a slew of diminutive @entity164 , jugglers and fire eaters			2
one bar staff member even patrolled the premises dressed as a security guard with a @entity170 three times his size			0
" i just landed a role as @entity177 , " says @entity5 , chuckling as he makes the shape of the headdress and cape of the saint			0
" in all my life , i never thought i would be doing something like that			0
" while the dream of starting a live - in community for @entity0 's little people is still to attract any financial backers , @entity5 is hopeful the scheme will one day come together			1
" so far we do n't have the money to go much further , " @entity5 says			0
the group has already sourced a 40 - acre site outside @entity0 , but the cost of developing the site and building housing is daunting			2
" what can i say except that dreams do come true , " he says , laughing infectiously			0
" there 's always @entity196			0
