@entity0 -- @entity2 's focusing on making new music in the hip - hop capital of @entity5 , while lawyers in three other cities prepare to defend him in court			1
@entity2 , who graduates from being a teen pop star when he celebrates his 20th birthday saturday , has several court dates on his calendar next month			2
@entity14 case there are good reasons that @entity2 's lawyers could reject a plea deal and demand a jury trial for the drunken driving charge in @entity21 , according to a @entity23 lawyer familiar with the case			1
lawyers sometimes beat the charge in court			2
a lawyer can defend a @entity14 charge by focusing on the technical aspects of the arrest and testing , questioning whether police did everything right , attorney @entity28 told @entity1			1
if problems or deficiencies are found in what law enforcement did , those issues could be challenged			0
was there probable cause for police to stop the singer 's @entity44 ? gps tracking data suggests the sports car was not speeding in the minutes before the arrest			0
if the judge lets a jury hear that , it might create reasonable doubt about the police officer 's claim he stopped @entity2 and friend @entity57 after seeing them drag racing on a residential street			1
was there probable cause for the officer to test @entity2 's sobriety ? the arresting officer said he became suspicious because he smelled alcohol on the singer 's breath , but lab tests later showed the alcohol level in his system was well below @entity23 's legal limit for drivers under the drinking age of 21			1
@entity2 's lawyer could argue that the officer made it up to justify the arrest			1
his defense might be bolstered if the judge allows the officer 's disciplinary record to be used to challenge his credibility			0
while the alcohol level was below the legal limit , a preliminary toxicology report on @entity2 's urine sample said he tested positive for " metabolite of @entity88 , " which indicates marijuana use , and alprazolam , the generic name for the prescription sedative @entity93			1
" yeah , we were smoking all night at the studio , " the singer told a police officer who told him he " reeked of marijuana , " according to police documents			0
no - risk trial in @entity23 defendants sometimes accept plea deals because they fear a judge would impose a tougher sentence if they were convicted in a trial			2
that 's not a risk with @entity23 's @entity14 law , @entity28 said			1
a judge would not give a sentence any different than what a prosecutor might offer in a plea deal , but a plea deal might allow the @entity14 charge to be kept off the defendant 's criminal record , replaced by reckless driving , he said			1
probation rules -- including a drug - testing requirement -- would be the same			0
so , why go to trial ? an acquittal would be @entity2 's only way to avoid probation and drug testing , short of persuading the @entity21 prosecutor to drop the case , @entity28 said			1
the prosecutor in @entity21 has not discussed a plea agreement with @entity2 's lawyer , @entity133 , a spokesman for the @entity131 state attorney 's office told @entity1 tuesday			1
" it 's way too early to offer a plea deal , if one was to be offered			1
" @entity2 could choose the @entity14 diversion program that is available to all first - time offenders , @entity133 said			1
it would last between six and nine months with random drug testing , about $ 1,000 in fines and fees , 40 hours of community service , an alcohol education class			0
in addition , @entity2 would have to attend a session in which victims of @entity14 wrecks tell their stories			1
" there are 11 stories presented by real victims and sometimes defendants who relay their experiences , " a description of the three - hour session said			0
" there is a quiz at the end , and the defendant has to score 100 percent prior to completion			0
" @entity163 , first - time offenders rarely go to jail if convicted of drunken driving in @entity23 , @entity28 said			0
@entity2 is likely not facing jail , unless he violates probation -- such as by failing a drug test			2
a trial had been scheduled to start next tuesday , but instead a " sounding " hearing will be held with lawyers talking to the judge about preparations for a trial			0
@entity176 assault charge @entity2 's best resolution of an assault charge in @entity176 may be a plea deal that includes a " diversion " plan , according to a @entity183 lawyer interviewed by @entity1			1
" if he goes to trial , he probably would be convicted , " said attorney @entity184 , a past president of the @entity185			0
" the @entity183 system 's conviction rate is extraordinarily high			0
" just 3.5 % of all defendants who plead not guilty and go to trial are acquitted , he said			0
@entity2 allegedly struck his limousine driver on the back of his head several times while driving to a @entity176 nightclub in december			1
@entity176 prosecutors are likely already talking to @entity2 's lawyer about a plea deal with a " conditional discharge , " in which the case would not be prosecuted if he takes part in anger management and community service , @entity184 said			1
it 's the likely result for a young person without a criminal record who is not a celebrity , he said			0
prosecutors will be under " intense scrutiny " and will want to avoid a deal that " looks like they 're favoring a famous @entity183 star , " he said			0
the first court hearing is set for march 10 , but @entity2 does not have to be there			2
a magistrate will hold several hearings over the next few months to make sure the prosecution has handed over all of its evidence , including statements and any video , to the defense before the case is assigned to a judge for trial , @entity184 said			2
@entity226 egg probe @entity2 faces a possible vandalism charge in connection with eggs tossed at his neighbor 's home last month , which caused an estimated $ 20,000 damage to a @entity234 , @entity226 , mansion			1
the egging case is what lawyers call a " wobbler			1
" the @entity0 district attorney 's office could prosecute it as a misdemeanor or a felony under @entity226 law			1
it is up to the prosecutor to decide how serious the case is , based on a defendant 's criminal history and other circumstances			2
a prosecutor has had the results of the sheriff 's investigation for almost three weeks , and a decision could come soon			2
a felony vandalism conviction could bring up to three years in prison and a $ 50,000 fine			0
the maximum penalty for a misdemeanor conviction is a year in the county jail and a $ 50,000 fine			0
a felony conviction could also limit @entity2 's ability to work in the @entity263 , because he is a @entity183 citizen with a work visa			1
investigators searched his $ 6.5 million home last month , seizing the security video			0
detectives gave the district attorney video clips identified from the night of the egg attack to use in the prosecution of @entity2			2
another video recorded by the neighbor was also provided to investigators			0
flying high ? the @entity276 is looking into allegations that @entity2 and other passengers onboard a charter flight from @entity183 to @entity281 's @entity280 on january 31 interfered with the flight crew , the agency said			2
@entity2 and his father were " extremely abusive verbally " to the flight attendant on the @entity286 aircraft as he traveled to attend the @entity287 , according to a law enforcement sources			2
both @entity289 refused a pilot 's repeated warnings to stop smoking pot on the flight , according to a report by @entity295 , which was read to @entity1			0
the @entity276 has not said when its investigation will conclude			0
@entity1 's @entity297 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 's @entity14 case could be headed to a trial , lawyer says
no plea offer , but @entity2 could choose a " diversion " program , @entity21 prosecutor says
taking the @entity176 assault charge to trial is not @entity2 's best *option* , a lawyer says
