@entity0 -- pro-independence parties in @entity3 defied the @entity5 government thursday by announcing in @entity6 that they plan to hold a referendum in november on whether the wealthy northeast region should be independent			1
@entity0 staunchly opposes the referendum and @entity11 independence , and a @entity5 government official rejected the announcement			2
" the vote will not be held , " justice minister @entity14 told reporters thursday in the hallways of @entity5 's parliament			1
even supporters admit that there is much to be done before the vote can take place on november 9 , 2014			1
" we expect to open negotiations with @entity0			0
the @entity5 state ca n't be blind about it , " said @entity23 , a top aide and spokesman for @entity11 regional president @entity25 , who had a prominent role thursday when his @entity28 party announced the plan with three other parties			0
they had previously said only that the vote would be sometime in late 2014			0
and they also announced the two - part referendum question : do you want @entity3 to become a state ? and if the voter answers yes , then comes this : do you want that state to be independent ? that 's a different formula from the single question that @entity44 voters are due to get on september 18 : should @entity44 be an independent country ? " @entity23 said the two - part question in @entity3 was the result of negotiations among the four pro-independence parties , but he noted that @entity50 has agreed to allow the @entity44 vote on self - determination , while @entity5 has not followed suit yet for @entity3			1
the @entity5 government says that @entity3 , with 7.5 million people , already has broad home - rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health			0
and @entity0 insists that the @entity5 @entity62 does not allow any of @entity5 's 17 regions to unilaterally break away , even one like @entity3 that has its own flag and language			1
the four pro-independence @entity11 parties hold a majority in the @entity11 regional parliament			0
there have been mass demonstrations in favor of self - determination on the past two @entity11 national days on september 11			1
this year , hundreds of thousands of people formed a human chain -- from northern @entity3 , at the @entity77 border , to its southern border with the @entity80 region -- to drive home the point			0
last year on september 11 , an estimated 1.5 million people demonstrated in @entity6 , the regional capital and @entity5 's second - largest city , for self - determination			2
various opinion polls show a very large majority of @entity11 want the right of self - determination			2
but if independence makes it to the ballot , polls show the result could be tighter , with some predicting a victory in the 50 % range .			0
