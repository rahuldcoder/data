-- throughout his prolific career @entity3 has gone by many titles -- actor , filmmaker , producer , songwriter -- but comedy is the epicenter of his life , drawing together his early work on tv shows like " @entity24 " and " @entity14 , " with his notable career in film with movies like " @entity18 , " " @entity19 " and " @entity20 , " a few of which have been translated to the @entity23 stage			1
@entity3 , now 86 , has won numerous awards and is presently one of only 14 people to receive the coveted @entity28 ( @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 )			1
on may 20 @entity33 will premiere a documentary on @entity3 , " american masters @entity3 : make a noise , " a film directed by @entity37 that chronicles @entity3 ' career and lasting influence			1
the film , which recently premiered at @entity41 in @entity42 , where @entity3 was joined by longtime collaborator and friend @entity44 , is an exhaustive look at the continually hilarious -- and often moving -- output of a filmmaker and writer who is largely responsible for the tone of contemporary comedy			1
@entity3 spoke with @entity0 at @entity51 , a humble second - floor office in the @entity53 in @entity42 where the filmmaker still works , about what it means to have your life compressed into a 90 - minute documentary			1
for @entity3 , who keeps all his awards gathered on a table behind his desk , the film is a way to understand his own impact and to see that his story , which may continue with a @entity23 version of " @entity20 , " has been meaningful to so many			1
@entity0 : what does it feel like to have someone create a film that recaps your entire life ? @entity3 : you know , it 's lucky i 'm smart because i understand it			1
if i did n't understand it i 'd be very angry			2
like , " you left out @entity79 ! " big swaths of my life were completely left out , but it 's ok			2
@entity0 : had you worked with the director prior to this film ? @entity3 : yeah , he took some beautiful pictures of me and my friend @entity44			1
he 's just a great photographer			2
i had heard of him as a director , but i did n't know what he had directed			2
i saw one thing he had directed and i said , " that 's the guy ! " he did [ an " @entity95 " ] on @entity94			2
it caught the essence of @entity94			2
@entity0 : as someone who tells stories for a living , do you have a sense of what your own narrative is ? @entity3 : i had five aunts and one uncle on my mother 's side -- just on my mother 's side			1
@entity113 was the only boy			2
this is crazy , but let me explain			2
if you were to try to do the story of @entity113 the cab driver , and the various celebrities or passengers he picked up , you could n't do it totally and correctly in an hour and a half			2
and that 's just @entity113 , a cab driver			2
so how are you going to do @entity3 ? i made a movie in @entity124 ! would n't that be an hour and a half if i just talked about " @entity127 " and how it came together ? @entity0 : when you look back over your career , does one film stand out as the one you 're most proud of ? @entity3 : the only thing that really stands out is the miracle of the firstborn			1
that miracle is represented in " @entity18			2
" they actually encouraged me and gave me the money to make a movie			0
of course , it was killed almost in childbirth by @entity142			0
@entity144 , she stuck a half of a scissor in my neck and gave me one of the worst reviews			0
it was my first movie			0
the newspapers were not that kind and i thought i 'd have to go back and do television where i 'd had success			0
but then the magazines , about a month later , came out and they saved me			0
and they saved my confidence in myself			0
i knew i could make a funny movie			0
@entity0 : do you feel like you were able to take on all the different film styles and genres in your work ? @entity3 : no , not everything			1
i have n't covered -- which is a big swath of movies -- a light , romantic movie comedy			1
girl - meets - boy type			0
it was never a primary interest			0
i was always more interested in history or @entity23			0
@entity0 : is there something you still hope to achieve ? @entity3 : i like the music in " @entity20 " and i think it would make a good musical			1
it already has two or three musical numbers , so i 'm thinking , maybe			1
if it keeps pestering me maybe i 'll write it			0
you write things out because they bother you and you just want to get rid of that thing in your head			0
so you create something to get rid of it			0
@entity0 : there seems to be an agreement that your work set the stage for modern comedy -- does that feel true ? @entity3 : i think i 'm the father of " @entity193 " and " @entity194 " [ on @entity23 ]			1
because for 20 years @entity23 was serious			1
i loved " @entity197 , " which i saw at 9 years old , and i liked " @entity196			0
" i just liked musical comedy and it was n't around			1
so when @entity200 bothered me morning , noon and night to make a musical of " @entity18 " i said , " no , no , no , no , yes			2
" and i did it and part of why i did it was my duty to bring back the musical comedy			1
@entity0 : do you have any scripts sitting around that have never actually been made into movies ? @entity3 : i think maybe two , of all the stuff i 've ever written that i never pursued again to get made			1
they were done very early			0
before " @entity18 , " when i had no reputation , i did a script called " marriage is a @entity216			0
" it 's about a guy who gets divorced and the only way out of his big alimony payments is if his ex-wife gets married again			0
but she has n't met anybody and it 's been going on two years , all he 's got left in his life is a grapefruit plant			0
every penny he makes goes to the alimony			0
so he decides to make a fictitious character -- he knows what she likes -- and wear a beard and marry her and then disappear in a drowning accident or something and be off the hook			0
i never got it sold			0
@entity0 : when you look back over your work , have you found that there 's something universally true of a good joke ? @entity3 : yes -- i think its reference has to not be an incident , but a condition			1
i think a good joke always refers to the human condition , to how our dreams fall apart or how we expect something and it does n't happen			1
a good joke translates in human experience			1
maybe not necessarily based on a movie or based on anything -- it does n't have to parody anything			0
a good joke is a human event			1
" american masters @entity3 : make a noise " premieres on @entity33 monday may 20 at 9 p.m. est / @entity267			1
a dvd with bonus material will be available tuesday may 21 from @entity270 .			0
