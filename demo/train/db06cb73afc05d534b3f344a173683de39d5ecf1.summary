@entity0 , @entity1 -- maj. @entity4 's three standby attorneys made clear friday they 're still trying to leave the case , despite a military judge 's earlier ruling keeping them on the job			1
as the admitted @entity0 gunman 's trial reconvened friday morning , two of the attorneys asked to be excused so they could work on asking a higher court to overrule judge col. @entity15 's decision			1
@entity15 allowed maj. @entity16 and maj. @entity17 to leave the court while the third attorney , lt. col. @entity18 , remained with @entity4 , who is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 others in a november 2009 shooting rampage at the @entity23 post near @entity24 , @entity1			1
the three attorneys had asked on wednesday to drop out of the case , saying they believed @entity4 -- who is representing himself but has the three attorneys as backup -- was trying to help the prosecution achieve a death sentence			1
but @entity15 ruled thursday that they must continue , saying it was " nothing more than their disagreement with @entity4 's strategy in conducting his defense			1
" with @entity16 and @entity37 away from the courtroom friday , prosecutors continued a brisk march through the witness list , planning to call 17 more people for testimony -- among them , a number of wounded survivors of the massacre			2
by the end of friday , prosecutors had called 48 of their 80 witnesses in three days -- a fast pace enabled in part by @entity4 's declining to cross-examine anyone in the first two days			1
@entity4 , an @entity23 psychiatrist who was paralyzed by a police bullet during the rampage , admitted at the start of the trial tuesday that he was the shooter at the @entity0 medical building where soldiers were being prepared for deployment to @entity60 and @entity61			1
if convicted , he could face the death penalty			1
in a military capital trial , a guilty plea is not an option			0
a @entity67 - born citizen of @entity69 descent , @entity4 had been scheduled to deploy to @entity60 before the killings			1
prosecutors allege the devout @entity72 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " giving presentations in defense of suicide bombings and about soldiers conflicted between military service and their religion when such conflicts result in crime			0
@entity4 did not want to deploy to fight against other @entity72 and believed " that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " col. @entity82 , the lead prosecutor in the case , said during opening statements			1
military death row : more than 50 years and no executions investigations that followed the @entity0 killings found @entity4 had been communicating via e-mail with @entity93 , the @entity94 - @entity67 radical cleric killed by a @entity67 drone attack in 2011			1
the case was first set to begin in march 2012 but was delayed repeatedly , notably over a previous judge 's unsuccessful demand that the beard @entity4 has grown while in custody be forcibly shaved			1
soldier on soldier attacks : fast facts prosecution witnesses have painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside the deployment processing center on the morning of november 5 , 2009 , as soldiers and civilians prepared to leave for @entity60 and @entity61			1
spec. @entity110 told the court his initial thought when he heard the shooting and the screams was that it was a training exercise because of a deadly shooting earlier at a mental health clinic at @entity61 's @entity118			2
" as the shots continued being fired repeatedly , the room filled with the smell of gunpowder and blood , " @entity110 said			0
@entity110 dropped to the ground for cover , and then saw a friend , @entity126			0
sgt. @entity127 , take a shot to the chest and fall			0
there was nothing but people falling down , " he said			0
@entity110 began to crawl toward nearby cubicles for cover			0
" i was crawling over the bodies of people who were n't moving , " @entity110 said			0
" there was a soldier with the back side of his head blown off			0
" amid the killing , there were moments of heroism			0
@entity110 told the court how he saw capt. @entity148 get up from the floor with a folding chair to attack the shooter			2
" he was shot and killed in front of me , " said @entity110 , who picked up a folding table to throw at the shooter as he reloaded			2
" i stood up , charged and prepared to throw the table			0
" but by then the shooter had reloaded and pointed his gun at @entity110 , shooting him in the head			2
@entity110 told the court he managed to crawl toward the cubicle , even as @entity4 shot him three more times			2
two soldiers hiding under a desk offered him aid			0
" i told the two soldiers , ' we ca n't stay here and die , ' " he said			2
" i told them to go , to run through the south entrance and not look back until they found help			0
" @entity110 used his body to act as a shield as the two soldiers made a run for it			0
then , according to @entity110 , he started to crawl over broken glass and bodies toward another exit			0
@entity110 made it out of the building on his own before being grabbed by the collar and dragged to safety			0
@entity0 witness on @entity4 : ' his punishment will come ' the court - martial was scheduled to resume monday at 9 a.m. local time			1
@entity2 's @entity188 reported from @entity0			1
@entity2 's @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			2
