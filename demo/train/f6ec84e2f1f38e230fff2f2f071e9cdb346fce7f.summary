@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 spent a second day suspended in uncertainty saturday as leading politicians met to resolve a national election that failed to yield an outright winner			1
@entity8 leader @entity8 , whose party came in third after thursday 's voting , held meetings with fellow party members saturday to discuss a possible deal with either of the two largest parties , @entity14 and the @entity15			1
@entity8 also met with conservative leader @entity16 saturday night , local media reported , while a broader meeting between @entity8 and the @entity15 is scheduled for sunday morning , a @entity8 spokeswoman told @entity2			1
during a break in the talks with his own party , @entity8 addressed hundreds of protesters in @entity0 who were demonstrating in favor of proportional representation , a system supported by the @entity8			1
send ireport your stories , videos , photos the @entity8 say the current electoral system is unfair and leaves them under - represented in @entity33			2
they say the number of seats they have in the @entity38 fails to reflect the number of votes they won across the country , and they believe each party 's allocation of seats should reflect the percentage of the national vote they get			2
for example , the @entity15 got 36 percent of the vote and 306 of the 650 seats in @entity33			2
under proportional representation , they would have gotten 234 seats			0
the @entity8 got 23 percent of the popular vote but won only 57 seats			1
proportional representation would have given them about 150 seats			0
" i never thought i 'd see @entity59 protesting for proportional representation , " @entity8 said			0
" take it from me , reforming politics is one of the reasons i went into politics			0
i campaigned for a better , more open , more transparent new politics every single day of this general election campaign			0
" i genuinely believe it is in the national interest , it is in the interest of everybody in @entity71 , to use this opportunity to usher in a new politics			0
" before he went into the meeting with members of his party saturday morning , @entity8 said " politicians have a duty to speak to each other			1
" " people deserve a good , stable government , and that 's why i 'm very keen that the @entity8 should enter into any discussions with other parties , as we 're doing , in a constructive spirit , " he explained			0
what happens next for @entity3 politics ? the @entity8 planned to meet with the @entity15 at 11 a.m. ( 6 a.m. et ) sunday , according to a @entity8 spokeswoman			1
when asked , a spokeswoman for the @entity15 declined to give a timeframe for a possible deal			1
why @entity3 politics needs to get used to horse trading @entity3 prime minister @entity94 , who leads the @entity14 , and the @entity95 both offered on friday to form an alliance with the @entity8 as they jostled for power after the election in which the @entity15 gained the most seats in the @entity38			1
@entity8 told reporters saturday morning that he remained focused on four priorities as he discussed the idea of a deal with another party : tax reform , education reform , a " new approach " to the economy , and " fundamental political reform			1
" full election coverage " it 's precisely those four changes which will guide us in the talks ahead , " @entity8 said			2
in an e-mail to @entity15 supporters on saturday , @entity16 made a case for the party to work with the @entity8			1
" i ... believe there are many areas of common ground between us and the @entity8 -- such as the need for education reform , building a low - carbon economy , reforming our political system , decentralizing power , protecting civil liberties and scrapping @entity130 cards , " @entity16 wrote			0
it 's unclear how far @entity16 will go on the @entity8 ' main priority , electoral reform			0
but he said in his e-mail that he is willing to compromise on some issues			0
" there are also areas where i believe we in the @entity15 can give ground , " he wrote , " both in the national interest and in the interests of forging an open and trusting partnership			2
for example , we want to work with the @entity8 to see how we can afford to reduce taxes on the lowest paid			0
" @entity94 , who remains prime minister even though @entity14 lost its parliamentary majority , said friday that he would be willing to negotiate with any party leader			2
what role does the queen play now ? official returns friday showed it would be impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats , resulting in what is known as a hung parliament			1
the conservatives came in first , with at least 306 seats in the 650 - seat parliament , followed by @entity14 with at least 258			0
the @entity8 came in third , with at least 57			0
the conservatives must forge some kind of deal with a smaller party in order to reach a voting majority in @entity33 , and they are most likely to turn to the @entity8 , analysts have said			1
parties smaller than the @entity8 hold too few seats in @entity33 for them to be realistic choices for the @entity15 , analysts have said			1
it 's also easier for the @entity15 to seek a partnership with just one party rather than many , said @entity174 , director of political polling at @entity176			2
such a partnership , however , does not necessarily have to take the form of a coalition , @entity174 said			0
" my personal opinion is that the most likely scenario is the @entity15 forming a minority government and going into some sort of leg - by - leg association with the @entity8 , " @entity174 told @entity2 on saturday			1
" the conservatives hope that will give them the support they need to get across their economic policies , which are the most pressing			0
" anger at polling stations though they are dubbed the kingmakers , because their support could be crucial to either of the two big parties , the @entity8 also do n't have much room to play with , @entity174 said			0
the last time @entity71 had a hung parliament was in february 1974 , when @entity197 's conservatives gained more votes but fewer seats in @entity33 than @entity14			1
unable to form a deal with the @entity201 , the @entity15 stayed on in a minority government , but found themselves back at the polls by october			2
" as the @entity8 are reported to have significantly less financing than the other two parties , they would have the most to lose from another election being called very soon , because elections are an expensive business , " @entity174 said			2
@entity2 's @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			0
