@entity0 -- @entity2 had won two majors before sunday , but none in front of his dear old mum			1
no wonder then that @entity7 and her 25 - year - old sank into tears as he walked off the 18th green at @entity0 as the new @entity14 @entity13 champion			1
a third major title of his fledgling career means the @entity18 is just a green jacket away from a career grand slam			1
but @entity2 's mum is just relieved the jinx she perceived to be preventing him from winning one in front of her evaporated in a blanket of cloud on @entity28			1
" there was high emotion on the 18th , there really was , " @entity2 told @entity1 from @entity0 's clubhouse , as jubilant members in the adjacent room chanted his name			1
" my mum , she had n't been to the previous two majors that i won , and it was incredible the first person that greeted me coming off the 18th was her			1
" it was really a nice moment , she was crying her eyes out and i was trying to hold back the tears -- i think a few tears definitely came out			2
special moment " it was a very special moment and to be able to share these moments with your parents -- especially parents like i have -- they 're two of my best friends			2
" i can talk to them about anything			2
they 've been there for me through thick and thin and its great to share these moments with them			0
" @entity2 's @entity13 victory was markedly different to his previous two major wins			1
in the @entity62 at @entity63 and the following year 's @entity64 at @entity65 he eviscerated the field , winning both by a scarcely believable margin of eight shots			1
at @entity0 he had to graft			1
leading by six shots prior to the final round he saw that shaved down to just two with a handful of holes left as @entity74 's @entity73 , a friend and @entity76 buddy , hounded him doggedly			1
but his links game , tweaked and perfected on the courses of his native @entity79 in the weeks leading up to the tournament , remained steadfast			0
despite shooting the worst score of any of the top 13 players on the final day , that cushion he 'd compiled over previous days smoothed his way to glory			0
top honor so how does this one rank ? " winning @entity13 , the home major for guys like myself , it 's a very special championship and i 'm so very honored to have won it , " he explained			1
" i think every major win is different			0
@entity63 was maybe silencing some of the doubters or battling some of the demons i had in my own head			0
" @entity65 was coming off a bit of a slump in form but still having a good year			0
it was almost , not expected , but i felt like in 2012 the only thing i really needed was to win a major and i did			0
" again this feels a bit more like the first one at @entity63 where i maybe had to silence a few doubters about how i played links golf , how can i handle a lead , how do i play well on a friday			0
" it 's been a difficult 18 months at times since the start of 2013 and obviously winning the @entity109 makes it all worthwhile			1
" by landing the @entity109 , into which @entity2 revealed some top quality red wine might go , he has three of the four major titles on offer			1
masters aim the one that continues to evade him is the @entity119 , a tournament that evokes harrowing memories			1
in 2011 , as a 21 - year - old , @entity2 led by four shots going into the final round , and disintegrated on the back nine , eventually finishing in a tie for 15th			1
but he 'll return to @entity125 with three pillars of a slam completed , and the chance to become the first @entity129 ever to clinch one			1
at just 25 , @entity2 has years ahead of him to secure entry into elite band of six who have won all four majors			1
but he 's aiming to do it at the first attempt			2
" i 'd love to , especially going to @entity125 now with three legs of the career grand slam under my belt and only having the green jacket to win , " he said			1
" i 'll be going with a lot of motivation , i 'll do everything i can to prepare the best way i can because it 'll be a great chance for me to put that little milestone in my career to bed and go forward			2
@entity149 next " before that there 's still the @entity64 to play at @entity151 and i want to try to do my best there but going to @entity125 next april is going to be a lot of fun			2
" that his @entity13 triumph came at @entity0 , in front of passionate and enthusiastic fans from @entity28 and those who had traveled across from @entity79 , was fitting			1
he lost in the opening round of the boys championship in 2003 but retained an affinity for these links that are tightly wedged into a small corner of the @entity164			0
it is an affinity that will last a lifetime after this week			0
" that boys championship was 2003 -- a lot can happen in 11 years that 's for sure , " he said			2
" i really enjoyed the course then			0
" when i came back here a couple of weeks ago i could n't remember all of the course -- obviously it looked much different with the grandstands and everything			0
" it 's a great golf course , a very fair golf course i feel , and if you play well you are rewarded			2
if you do n't hit it so well you can put yourself in spots that make it very difficult for yourself			0
" @entity0 is a course that i obviously love now but even when i got here a couple of weeks ago it was a course i felt i could do well on			1
" decline reversed @entity2 's @entity13 career had been in decline before this triumph			1
after winning the low amateur medal in 2007 , he finished third at @entity188 's in 2010			2
he led after the opening round and shot 80 the following day before steadying over the weekend			0
the following year at @entity190 's he struck an stroppy note when claiming the oldest major was too reliant on weather conditions and that he was n't prepared to change his game " for one week a year			2
" in 2012 he finished 60th and last year at @entity195 he did n't even make the cut , a moment he acknowledged as one of his lowest in recent times at his winner 's press conference			2
but a period of practice on links courses and in links conditions back in @entity79 prior to landing at @entity205 have recalibrated his game in triumphant fashion			0
" i think you need experiences like the one in 2010 , having the first round lead and losing it , " he said			0
lesson learned " ok , i came back and finished third but you need experiences like that to move forward and to learn from			0
" i definitely learned a lot from that day in 2010 just as i learned a lot from my day at @entity125 in 2011 , having a four - shot lead going into the final day and ultimately losing out , having a very bad back nine			0
" did i feel like i could do it this year ? i did			0
i felt like my game was in good shape			0
i had the win earlier in the year at @entity221 and i felt like my game was just coming into form			0
" i just needed something to click and luckily everything clicked this week			0
