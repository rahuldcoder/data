@entity0 , @entity1 -- early this year @entity1 -- along with much of eastern @entity3 -- was caught in a deep and protracted cold snap			2
many froze to death , energy demand spiked , and to top it all @entity9 accused @entity1 of stealing gas from transit pipes destined for western @entity3 for the second time in three years			1
@entity1 issued a firm denial , adding another blot to the two nations ' fraught -- but highly dependent -- relationship			0
the fact remains that @entity1 needs @entity9 gas while @entity9 needs @entity1 's transit pipeline to export west			1
the spat came on the heels of a disastrous relationship meltdown in 2009 , when for two nerve - wracking weeks @entity9 abruptly stopped pumping gas to @entity1 and @entity3			1
the @entity9 energy giant @entity24 claimed @entity1 's gas company -- @entity26 -- owed it huge sums of money in missed payments and fines			1
however , @entity26 countered that it had paid the bill and claimed that @entity24 was in fact trying to force it to accept a new price for gas which it could ill afford			0
they eventually reached a deal , but @entity1 's prime minister @entity39 still maintains that the terms are unfair : " @entity41 pay $ 70 for 1000 cubic meters of gas when @entity1 pays $ 550 to @entity9 for the same amount			1
it means almost ten times more			0
tell me what kind of economy can take this ? " he told @entity2			0
however , @entity41 benefits from its own vast reserves of natural gas , and @entity9 argues that still @entity1 gets it for less than consumers in @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
so , while @entity1 tries to negotiate a better deal with @entity9 , it 's also working to break its dependency on @entity9 gas and diversify its sources of energy			1
a key part of the plan is to import liquid natural gas from other countries -- such as @entity67 -- which will be processed at a terminal built near the vast port of @entity70 on the @entity71			0
the head of the project , @entity72 , says that by 2018 it should have replaced 30 % of existing @entity9 gas imports			1
" it will have 10 billion cubic meters of alternative gas			0
it will help us to negotiate with our main supplier , " he said			0
at the same time @entity82 , the @entity1 energy minister , has high hopes that shale gas -- formed deep underground within large shale rock formations -- could also be a major alternative source of power in the decades to come			1
he told @entity2 that shale gas exploration in western @entity1 has " very large potential			1
" but it 's not just alternative gas supplies that the energy - hungry nation of 44.8 million residents has in its sights			2
the government has pledged to invest heavily in green energy			2
however , this wo n't do much to bolster their eco-credentials , as they are also planning to burn a great deal more coal too			0
it 's all testament to their increasing desire to generate power without recourse to gas			0
meanwhile , as @entity1 looks for other energy supplies , @entity9 is looking for other ways to get its gas to @entity3			1
@entity9 is the world 's biggest producer of natural gas and supplies @entity3 with nearly 40 % of its imports , according to the @entity119			2
it has already built one pipeline that bypasses @entity1			2
the 765 - mile long " @entity122 " pipeline -- costing more than $ 12 billion -- directly links @entity9 with the @entity123 via the @entity125 bed			1
at its launch in 2011 , the then @entity9 prime minister , now president , @entity126 , made an ominous and thinly - veiled reference to his @entity1 neighbors			1
" any transit country has always the temptation to take advantage of its transit status , " he said			0
" that exclusivity is now disappearing			0
" at the end of this year , @entity9 plans to begin construction on another gas pipe to @entity3 -- the " @entity138 " -- running through the @entity71 to @entity139 and on to @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142			2
the projects threaten to strip @entity1 of billions in revenue and any remaining leverage it might have over future gas prices			0
but in an effort to salvage long - term relations , @entity1 is now proposing a new model that would allow themselves , @entity3 and @entity9 equal control of their transit system			1
" so the consumers , the sellers , the supply and transit country is together			0
it 's a good model and it 's convenient for everybody , " says energy minister @entity82			0
only time will tell if these major energy reforms will change @entity9 's position in future negotiations and transform the horizon of @entity1 's economic future .			2

@entity1 and @entity9 have long - *standing* feud over gas supply lines
@entity1 is big importer of @entity9 gas , while @entity9 depends on @entity1 pipeline
in recent years , @entity1 has tried to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependence
liquid gas imports , underground shale gas and green energy are among new sources
