-- president @entity2 is seriously contemplating withdrawing all @entity4 troops from @entity5 sometime in 2014 , a senior administration official told @entity0 's @entity6			1
the @entity2 administration had been considering leaving a force of at least several thousand soldiers to act as trainers and to hunt leaders of the @entity12 and other militant groups after the long - scheduled withdrawal of all combat troops in december 2014			0
but @entity2 has grown increasingly frustrated in his dealings with @entity5 president @entity17 , who last month cut off negotiations about the size of the post- 2014 @entity4 military force			2
@entity17 objected to the @entity4 beginning formal direct discussions with the @entity12 about peace ; he regarded this move as happening behind his back and a betrayal			2
let 's stipulate that @entity17 can be a frustrating leader to deal with and that he can even be quite mercurial on occasions			0
that said , the @entity2 administration should n't be making important strategic decisions merely on the basis of whether or not its leaders like dealing with another country 's leader			0
further , @entity17 will be gone in april 2014 , when the next @entity5 presidential election will take place ; in only nine months , the @entity2 administration wo n't have to deal with him at all			0
in any case , zeroing out @entity4 troop levels in the post- 2014 @entity5 is a bad idea on its face -- and even raising this concept publicly is maladroit strategic messaging to @entity5 and the region writ large			1
why so ? afghans well remember something that most @entity4 have forgotten			0
after the @entity44 withdrew from @entity5 , something that was accomplished at the cost of more than a million @entity5 lives and billions of dollars of @entity4 aid , the @entity4 closed its embassy in @entity5 in 1989 during the @entity51 administration and then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world under the @entity57 administration			0
it essentially turned its back on @entity5 once they had served their purpose of dealing a deathblow to the @entity44			0
as a result , the @entity4 had virtually no understanding of the subsequent vacuum in @entity5 into which eventually stepped the @entity12 , who rose to power in the mid- 1990s			1
the @entity12 granted shelter to @entity68 and his @entity70 organization from 1996 onward			0
after the overthrow of the @entity12 , a form of this mistake was made again by the @entity75 administration , which had an ideological disdain for nation building and was distracted by the @entity78 , so that in the first years after the fall of the @entity12 , only a few thousand @entity4 soldiers were stationed in @entity5			1
the relatively small number of @entity4 boots on the ground in @entity5 helped to create a vacuum of security in the country , which the @entity12 would deftly exploit , so that by 2007 , they once again posed a significant military threat in @entity5			1
in 2009 , @entity2 ordered a surge of 30,000 troops into @entity5 to blunt the @entity12 's gathering momentum , which it has certainly accomplished			2
read more : inside the @entity12 but when @entity2 announced the new troops of the @entity5 surge , most media accounts of the speech seized on the fact that the president also said that some of those troops would be coming home in july 2011			2
this had the unintended effect of signaling to the @entity12 that the @entity4 was pulling out of @entity5 reasonably soon and fit into the longstanding narrative that many @entity5 have that the @entity4 will abandon them again			1
similarly , the current public discussion of zero @entity4 troop presence in @entity5 after 2014 will encourage those hardliner elements of the @entity12 who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the @entity4 out			1
it also discourages the many millions of @entity5 who see a longtime @entity4 presence as the best guarantor that the @entity12 wo n't come back in any meaningful way and also an important element in dissuading powerful neighbors such as @entity118 from interference in @entity5 's internal affairs			1
read related : @entity5 vet finds a new way to serve instead of publicly discussing the zero option on troops in @entity5 after 2014 , a much smarter @entity4 messaging strategy for the country and the region would be to emphasize that the @entity129 that the @entity4 has already negotiated with @entity5 last year guarantees that the @entity4 will have some form of partnership with the @entity5 until 2024			2
in this messaging strategy , the point should be made that the exact size of the @entity4 troop presence after 2014 is less important than the fact that @entity4 soldiers will stay in the country for many years , with @entity5 consent , as a guarantor of @entity5 's stability			0
the @entity4 continues to station thousands of troops in @entity144 more than five decades after the end of the @entity146			1
under this @entity4 security umbrella , @entity144 has gone from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest			0
it is this kind of model that most @entity5 want and the @entity4 needs to provide so @entity5 does n't revert to the kind of chaos that beset it in the mid- 1990s and from which the @entity12 first emerged			1

@entity163 *mulling* withdrawing all @entity4 troops from @entity5 , official said
@entity165 said the idea would be dangerous and send the wrong message
he says @entity4 abandoned @entity5 before and the @entity12 stepped into vacuum
@entity172 : @entity4 should follow model it set in @entity144 at end of @entity146
