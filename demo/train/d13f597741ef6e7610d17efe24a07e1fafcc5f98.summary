-- when traveling , some countries just do n't like you			2
or at least , it can certainly feel that way			2
a new report , put out earlier this month by the @entity6 , has ranked which countries roll out the welcome mat to travelers and which give the cold shoulder			1
the " @entity16 " ranked 140 countries according to attractiveness and competitiveness in the travel and tourism industries			2
@entity17 among the extensive analyses , one of the most interesting rankings was how welcome tourists are in each country , under the category " attitude of population toward foreign visitors			1
" and the world 's most unfriendly country , according to the data ? @entity30 took the dubious honor , scoring a 4.1 out of seven on a scale of " very unwelcome " ( 0 ) to " very welcome " ( 7 )			1
@entity33 and the @entity34 were next			0
interestingly , despite their huge tourist arrivals , @entity35 and @entity36 tied with four other countries for the eighth least friendly spot			0
at the other end of the scale , @entity41 and @entity42 were ranked the world 's most welcoming nations for visitors			1
you can see a top 10 for friendliest and unfriendliest at the bottom of this article			2
strengths and weaknesses the " friendly " ranking was just one aspect of the report , analyzing each country 's competitiveness in travel and tourism			1
that competitiveness is " based on the extent to which they are putting in place the factors and policies to make it attractive to develop the travel and tourism sector			0
" in the overall @entity70 , @entity69 was the top region with the first five positions all held by @entity69 countries			0
@entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 were the top three in that order			1
@entity73 has headed the ranking since the index began five years ago			1
excellent tourism infrastructure and facilities , business travel appeal , sustainable development of natural resources and rich cultural resources were among the key factors in landing the highest positions in the rankings			2
safety / security , underdeveloped infrastructure and concerns about sustainable development were among the factors bringing down countries ' competitiveness			0
@entity96 scored the lowest on the competitiveness index			0
the @entity99 ( 6th ) topped the combined @entity100 , @entity101 ( 10th ) just pushed out @entity102 and @entity42 to lead the @entity103 , the @entity98 ( 28th ) was the highest performer in the @entity105 and the @entity106 ( 38th ) overtook @entity107 to head @entity108			1
the report emphasized the need for continued development in the travel and tourism sector particularly for its role in job creation in a relatively stagnant global economy			0
the industry currently accounts for one in 11 jobs in the world			0
the report used data compiled from the @entity6 's @entity121 and hard data from private sources and national and international agencies and organizations such as the @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity130 / @entity129 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
