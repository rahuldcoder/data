-- as theater , @entity2 's congressional testimony on the september attack on the @entity5 diplomatic mission in @entity6 did not disappoint			1
the secretary of state was prepared			0
@entity9 likely regrets her exasperated response to persistent questions by sen. @entity12 of @entity13 , who repeated the charge that the @entity16 administration had misled @entity5 over whether there was a protest on the night of the @entity6 attack , as reports first indicated			1
she exploded : " with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity5			1
was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some @entity5 ? what difference , at this point , does it make ? " the response instantly inspired the critical hashtag @entity32 and became a hot topic on right - wing radio			2
but otherwise , @entity37 members of @entity38 hardly laid a glove on her , perhaps because the party has bizarrely focused on the @entity16 administration 's post-attack talking points instead of more important issues : does the @entity45 have the resources and policies it needs to keep @entity5 diplomats safe ? what level of threat do extremist groups in the region really pose to @entity5 interests ? and what does the @entity16 administration want to accomplish there ? the hearings should have been more substantive because the @entity5 is at a dangerous inflection point in @entity59 and the @entity60 to its south , and leaders in both parties need to think carefully about how deeply we want to get involved in this volatile part of the world			1
in @entity67 , the @entity5 has already helped overthrow @entity68 , whose vast arsenal has ended up in the hands of some pretty nasty characters			2
with some in the @entity74 reportedly pushing for drone strikes in @entity76 , and the @entity5 providing logistical and intelligence help to @entity79 forces there , we are gradually getting sucked into conflicts that were never considered our vital concern			1
in her opening statement , @entity9 tried to put the @entity6 attack in this context , describing steps the @entity5 is taking to address " the broader strategic challenge in @entity59 and the wider region			1
" " the @entity91 revolutions have scrambled power dynamics and shattered security forces across the region , " she said			0
" and instability in @entity76 has created an expanding safe haven for terrorists who look to extend their influence and plot further attacks of the kind we saw just last week in @entity101			0
" those attacks , in which a group of jihadists tied to @entity105 seized control over a natural gas facility and took dozens of hostages , are indeed alarming			2
oil and gas facilities across @entity59 , especially in @entity67 , are likely vulnerable			0
@entity5 diplomatic facilities are almost certainly at risk			2
but it 's by no means clear what threat @entity105 , or for that matter its ally @entity116 , one of the @entity119 groups controlling northern @entity76 , poses to the @entity5			1
as terrorism exert @entity121 notes , @entity105 " largely lost its struggle in @entity101 " before joining forces with @entity105 's high command in @entity125 and trying to wrap its longstanding fight with the @entity101 military into the global jihad			1
and rebel groups such as the @entity130 have a long history of using harsh tactics to extract concessions from the central government			0
is getting involved in their parochial struggles the best way to keep @entity5 safe ? perhaps a better question is how involved we want to be			2
some reports have linked @entity105 , which has ties to @entity105 's leadership in @entity125 , to the @entity6 attack			1
three @entity5 died in the gas plant in @entity101 , and seven more barely escaped with their lives			2
the @entity5 reportedly has had special operations forces in @entity76 for years			1
so , in a sense , @entity5 already is very much involved			2
but that does n't mean the right course of action is to get in deeper			0
to varying degrees , @entity105 and its allies clearly do pose a threat to @entity5 interests in their corner of @entity59 , but there 's little evidence that they have the capability or intent to strike the @entity5 homeland			1
the @entity5 needs to lead from behind in this region -- but way , way behind , with @entity79 and @entity167 forces in the front			1
@entity169 would like nothing more than to drag the @entity5 into another protracted quagmire			0
in her testimony , @entity9 outlined the stakes			0
" we are in for a struggle , but it is a necessary struggle			0
we can not permit northern @entity76 to become a safe haven			0
" we 've got to have a better strategy , " she said			0
i could n't agree more			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184			0

@entity184 : critics focused on @entity9 's fiery comments at hearing , not more pressing issue
he says focus should be danger of @entity5 getting drawn into fighting extremists in @entity195
he says it 's not clear what threat @entity105 poses to @entity5
@entity184 : @entity5 should lead from way behind @entity79 , @entity167 forces while developing strategy
