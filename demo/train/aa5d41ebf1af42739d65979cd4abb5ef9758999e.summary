-- the sports insurance company that paid @entity4 more than $ 10 million in bonuses plans to file a lawsuit to recover its money , an attorney for @entity2 told @entity0 on wednesday			1
@entity8 said @entity2 has already asked the disgraced former cycling champ for the money back			1
an attorney for @entity4 said the claim has no merit			1
" we made our demand for the return of the money we paid him for winning the @entity19 races where the titles were stripped , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity14			1
" mr. @entity4 and his legal team have not complied with that demand			1
" @entity8 said the suit , which has not been filed yet , will ask for the return of $ 12 million in bonus money paid for wins from 2002 to 2005 and for millions in legal costs and interest			1
@entity4 sued @entity2 after it delayed his 2005 bonus payment and raised questions about allegations involving his use of performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity4 testified under oath in that case that he had never doped			2
@entity2 settled with @entity4 a year later			1
" but both he and his lawyers almost taunted us and said if we are ever stripped of those titles , we will give you the money back , " @entity8 said wednesday			0
" we will simply ask him to finally live up to his word and give that money back			0
" @entity4 's attorney , @entity44 , argues the insurance company has no right to the money because of the 2006 settlement agreement , which reads in part , " no party may challenge , appeal or attempt to set aside the arbitration award			2
" @entity44 says , " it is clear as day the insurance company has zero right to reopen the matter			0
" @entity8 said that @entity4 lied throughout his testimony , not just about whether he had blood doped or taken steroids			2
" he lied about virtually everything			0
and we are going to ask the arbitration panel that heard that testimony to punish him and hold him accountable for it , " the attorney said			0
a year ago , federal prosecutors told @entity4 that the two - year investigation into his use of performance enhancing drugs was over			1
no charges would be filed			0
" we made a decision on that case a little over a year ago			0
obviously , we 've been well aware of the statements that have been made by mr. @entity4 in other media reports			2
that has not changed my view at this time , " @entity73 attorney @entity72 said this week			0
now it appears that federal investigators may not be ready to give up just yet			0
citing high - level sources , @entity78 reported that agents are looking into charges of obstruction , intimidation and witness tampering			0
a spokesperson for the @entity86 , which has been investigating @entity4 , told @entity0 it 's " an ongoing matter			1
" @entity4 first admitted the use of performance enhancing drugs and blood doping during a january television interview with @entity93 , ending years of denial that he cheated during the prime years of his cycling career			2
he was stripped of his @entity19 titles by international cycling 's governing body in october after a damning report by the @entity100 accused him and his team of " the most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program " in cycling history			1
the agency said wednesday that it has been in talks with @entity4 about having him help clean up the sport			2
chief executive officer @entity107 said @entity4 was granted a two - week extension to wednesday 's deadline to tell the @entity100 whether he will help or not			1
@entity100 has banned @entity4 , 41 , for life but did say the ban could be reduced to eight years if he cooperated under oath with investigators			1
@entity4 's cycling career is long over , but he competed in and won several triathlons in 2012			2
@entity4 told @entity116 in late january that he thought a @entity117 , run by the @entity118 , was the " only way forward			0
" at the time he said @entity118 should run the probe , not the @entity100 , " this is a global sport , not an @entity73 one			1
one thing i 'd add , the ( @entity123 ) has no place at the table			0
" since @entity4 's interview with @entity93 , the disgraced cyclist has disappeared from public view			1
once prolific on @entity129 , he has n't tweeted in nearly a month , and his profile page now ends with these words of wisdom : " @entity134 patience in 1996 but only now am i getting to know and appreciate her			0
" @entity0 's @entity136 reported from @entity137			0
@entity138 reported and wrote this story in @entity140			0
@entity0 's @entity141 and @entity142 also contributed to this story .			0
