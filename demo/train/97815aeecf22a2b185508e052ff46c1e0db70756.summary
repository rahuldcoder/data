-- as a @entity3 - area homicide detective , @entity1 has met some really bad people			1
now retired , the 30 - year law enforcement veteran reveals trade secrets about how he " made friends " with criminals and coaxed them to confess			1
for example , take @entity10 -- a convicted murderer and sexual predator who died last year in a @entity15 prison			1
when he was with @entity16 in 1972 , @entity1 arrested @entity10 for the strangling death of @entity10 ' @entity3 neighbor , @entity18			1
@entity1 , who spoke with @entity0 by phone , described the handsome , 6 - foot , blue - eyed @entity10 as " someone you trust right away , very pleasant to talk to , soft spoken , somebody you would n't think would be a dangerous killer			1
but these killers are the most dangerous of all			2
" for them , @entity1 said , killing is " like an addiction , like heroin , and they 've got ta have that murder fix			1
" so , how did @entity1 get @entity10 to confess ? " i made friends with him , " he said matter - of - factly			1
" it took half an hour			0
" but he did n't do it alone			0
" i had another cop in the room with me , and we knew each other 's methods			0
the other detective just stayed quiet			2
he was there for support , but not to be a part of the interrogation			0
" sitting close to @entity10 with his knees almost touching him , @entity1 said he would lean toward him during the interrogation			1
" i was really appearing to be interested in him , " @entity1 said			1
then they started talking about how @entity10 ' life , family , father and mother had all affected him and " how that led to what he had just done			1
" and then @entity10 began " blathering the confession out , " @entity1 said			1
" although @entity10 was sentenced to life in prison , he was paroled in 1985			1
nine years later @entity10 was convicted of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a minor and sentenced to 19 years			1
in 2012 , dna testing linked @entity10 to the 1992 murder of 21 - year - old @entity60			1
before @entity10 died last year , police tried to interview him , without success , to determine if he was behind the disappearance of 20 - year - old @entity64 in 1989			1
after his death , investigators found a journal in @entity10 ' cell with a note that read " 2/9/89 " -- the date @entity71 disappeared			1
" no. 2 " was scrawled on both sides of the notation			0
police believe it 's an indication that @entity71 was @entity10 ' second victim			1
read more about @entity10 in 2003 , @entity1 played a very different role in another @entity15 murder case			1
while researching a crime novel , @entity1 began corresponding with @entity80 , a former police officer who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1987 murder of an 11 - year - old girl named @entity84			1
@entity80 has been on death row for more than 25 years , as the appeals process plays out			2
@entity1 sat face - to - face with @entity80 in a prison lunchroom , a conversation both men describe in @entity0 's documentary series , " @entity92 , " airing this sunday at 9 p.m. et. see more about @entity80 and @entity1 successfully interrogating suspects one - on - one , @entity1 said , requires patience			1
" you ca n't come across as though you 're personally involved , " he said			0
" you ca n't come across like you 're mad or angry or impatient or putting pressure on			0
real jailhouse police questioning does n't happen the way it 's portrayed by @entity99			0
according to @entity1 , the @entity101 © , the two - cops - on - one - suspect scenario with angry , screaming interrogators is n't part of the real world			1
we 've broken down @entity1 's method into three ideas : 1			1
" the most important thing is gaining their confidence , respect and cooperation			0
" @entity1 repeated his theme : " i just kinda made friends			1
" at the beginning of the interrogation you do n't even go into what you 're there for			0
wait 15 minutes , 30 minutes			0
what you want to do is get the person talking and feeling good about talking to you			0
" eventually you just work your way into whatever the issue is			0
next thing you know , someone 's just blathering a confession			2
believe me that 's how it worked			0
" ' i just got a hunch ' during all his years on the force , @entity1 claims he never arrested the wrong person in a case			1
@entity1 told a story about a case where he questioned a man whose aunt accused him of raping her			2
" during the interrogation he was adamant that he did n't do it , " @entity1 recalled			2
" well of course a lot of guilty people are adamant that they did n't do it			0
but i just got a hunch â € ” something about the guy			0
so i started thinking , ' maybe we ought to check this out further before we actually book him			0
' we went back out on the streets , and we found the aunt again , and we polygraphed her			0
after polygraphing her , she admitted that she had told a lie			0
" @entity1 said it turned out the aunt had " an ulterior motive about her wanting to have him arrested			2
" he then freed the suspect			0
the ' conveyor belt ' after three decades as a law enforcement officer , @entity1 has some opinions about @entity166 's justice system			2
public defender resources are overburdened , @entity1 said			2
which sometimes contributes to less than fair circumstances			0
" it 's really an uneven system to have people who can afford a good attorney and other people who can only afford public defenders , " @entity1 said			2
" i asked a public defender once , ' how do you keep up with the caseload ? ' and he said , ' it 's like @entity180 and the conveyor belt : you just ca n't keep up with it			0
' " a lot of public defenders are talented and would like to do a better job , @entity1 said			2
" but they 're constrained by the enormous stresses and the pressures to keep up with their caseloads			0
the death penalty @entity0 's " @entity92 " draws back the curtain on how murder cases are investigated and prosecuted			1
it connects the judicial dots between the crimes , the evidence , the trial and the death chamber			2
@entity1 joked about his days as a " hotshot detective , " when he used to favor the use of the death penalty in some cases			1
but in the years after his retirement in 1990 , @entity1 has turned a 180 on the issue			2
now 73 , @entity1 has been writing crime novels , which require many hours of research			1
" the death penalty is something i researched a lot about , " he said			1
" how many times do we find people who 've had life sentences and 25 years later @entity214 proves them to be innocent ? those same people could easily have been executed by now			0
i 'm sure that there have been people executed who are innocent			0
" that 's just not acceptable , he said			0
" i 've realized that society ca n't sacrifice some innocent people once in a while just so it can get all the guilty ones			0
" @entity1 said society should consider alternative punishments for dangerous criminals			2
" because , basically , putting someone to death is murder , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's intentional murder			0
is n't it ? " are overburdened defense attorneys breaking @entity166 's justice system ? what do you think ? tell us in the comments below			0
@entity0 's @entity240 contributed to this report			0
