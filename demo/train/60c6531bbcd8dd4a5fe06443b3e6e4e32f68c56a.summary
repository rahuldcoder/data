-- for 17 - year - old @entity3 , his senior year was supposed to be the best yet			1
he was a straight - a student and homecoming king at @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , and was the @entity10 ' star running back			1
he was a starter on the varsity basketball team and loved to sing at church			1
he was the son any mother dreamed of having			1
his mom , @entity14 , recalls , " he was an athlete , but school was important			2
his grades , his teachers and just having a family ... he had his priorities right			2
" the final game of his senior year turned out to be the final game of his life			2
@entity3 died playing the game he loved , football			1
his autopsy would reveal he died of second - impact syndrome , when a player is hit again before the brain has had a chance to heal from an initial concussion			2
but it would turn out that those repetitive hits @entity3 took on the field would also make him the youngest reported case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity37 )			1
it 's a degenerative disease found in football players and other athletes in contact sports who get repeated hits to their heads			1
the day after homecoming , @entity3 complained of headaches			1
but nothing unusual , until five days later , when his mom received a call from his athletics trainer			2
" @entity3 's telling me he 's still having headaches			1
you need to go take him to the emergency room			2
' " and so @entity14 did			2
@entity3 had a @entity55 scan and the doctors reported a clean bill of health			1
yet , to be on the safe side , doctors kept him out of play for three weeks			2
@entity7 is one of 34 states that require a player to be cleared by a health care professional before they return to play			2
in addition , @entity7 also requires that players and their parents sign a waiver acknowledging the risks of concussions			2
when @entity14 and @entity3 returned to the doctor 's office three weeks later , @entity14 remembers @entity3 turning to her and asking " now , @entity74 , are you ok with this ? " she did n't want him to , but it was hard for her to say no. " you know , it 's his choice , " she said			1
his first game back , @entity14 remembers him getting hit			2
" i saw him kind of get stunned			2
but he walks out and tells @entity83 , ' oh i 've never felt better , that was the best game , i never felt so good			2
' " he even took his acts the following day and had no complaints			2
the headaches that had bothered @entity3 several weeks before were gone , or at least appeared so to his parents			1
the following week was the final game of his career			0
@entity3 intercepted the ball and sprinted toward the end zone			1
" if you would watch him run , he had a flow about him that was just beautiful			0
i mean it looked so graceful , " remembers his dad , @entity83			0
but right before halftime , his parents noticed @entity3 was acting strangely			1
" i watched him walk off the field , and i said , ' he 's walking funny			0
' i mean , i know that kid so well , " said @entity14			0
it was someone on the bench by @entity3			1
something 's wrong , " she heard			0
by the time @entity83 and @entity14 made it to the bench , it was too late			0
@entity3 had collapsed on the sidelines			1
his mother rushed to his side , trying to get him to wake up			0
" come on buddy , it 's your mama , come on ! " she urged			0
but instead of waking up , @entity3 began seizuring			1
he was airlifted to the @entity116 , some 50 miles away , and rushed into surgery			0
four hours later , the doctors came out to tell @entity83 and @entity14 they stopped the bleeding in his brain , but @entity3 's lungs and heart were too weak to go on			1
by 4 a.m. the following morning , @entity3 was off life support			1
@entity3 's autopsy revealed he died from multiple hits to the head , also known as second impact syndrome			1
as @entity83 and @entity14 tried to determine what was next , @entity83 received a call he never expected			0
" you know when you get a telephone call after your son dies saying they want your son 's brain , sometimes that 's a hard call to get			0
" on the other end of the line was @entity139 , one of the co-directors of the @entity141 for the @entity142			0
the center works with the @entity144 for the @entity142 ( @entity146 ) @entity145 , and together they work to understand what those hard hits on the field are doing to the brain , by looking inside the brain			1
@entity139 spends his time tracking football and sport related deaths and having to make the difficult calls to their families			0
" i have called hundred of families within 48 hours of their loved ones dying , and it 's never easy			0
" instead he focuses on the fact that the bank 's work will protect families in the future			0
" i hate every call we make , but you know , i honestly , i have to prep and think of the positives that come out of it			0
" the @entity145 is the world 's largest collection of athlete brains			0
since its inception in 2008 , the bank has documented more than 50 cases of @entity37			0
much of that work is in the hands of dr. @entity180 , the bank 's director and neuropathologist			0
she actually dissects the brain to track the trauma , and what she 's finding in the brains of some players in their 40s and 50s is astonishing			0
" you expect a pristine brain			0
i saw a brain that was riddled with tau proteins			0
i was stunned at how similar that brain was to the boxers who lived into their 70s , " she said			0
tau proteins are the same type of proteins found in brains of @entity204 's patients			1
but to see the same type of damage in 17 - year - old @entity3 ' brain was something that surprised even @entity180			1
it 's the youngest case she 's documented , and for her that was a call to action			1
" it tells you that we 've really got to protect our kids , " she said			0
" it 's not just car seats and seatbelts , but it 's making sure that when they go out to play sports that we take proper precaution and we give them proper advice			0
" and that means making sure that athletes take the time to recover from concussions , and making sure they are n't playing symptomatic , while having headaches or memory problems			1
for @entity83 and @entity236 , the findings and the warnings were too late to save their son			0
but @entity83 knows that @entity3 's legacy will live on as researchers learn more about concussions and how to treat them			1
" i think there are some issues that need to be looked at , and i think that 's happening , " he said			0
" and i think that @entity3 is helping that			1

@entity3 was the youngest reported case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy
