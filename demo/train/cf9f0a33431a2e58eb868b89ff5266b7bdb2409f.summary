it seems like every year another country 's lifestyle is touted as the new magic bullet to cure us of obesity , heart disease , and premature death : for an unclogged heart , herd goats and down olive oil like a @entity17			1
avoid breast cancer and live to 100 by dining on tofu @entity20 - style			1
stay as happy as @entity22 by hunting elk and foraging for cowberries			2
the places we 're usually told to emulate are known as @entity27			2
blue zones were pinpointed by explorer @entity29 and a team of longevity researchers and are described in his book " the blue zones : lessons for @entity36 from the people who 've lived the @entity38			2
" they 're areas in @entity40 , @entity20 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 where the people have traditionally stayed healthy and active to age 100 or older			2
similarly , @entity45 , as identified by integrative medicine physician @entity46 , @entity47 , author of " @entity48 , " are five areas in @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity20 , @entity41 , and @entity52 with low rates of " western " ailments like heart disease , depression , and certain cancers			1
@entity0 : how to live to 100 now i 'd like to eat my way to a long life , but i 'm not about to start foraging for raw plants -- i live in @entity62			1
i admire the vascular supremacy of @entity17 folks , but i doubt i could completely replace butter with olive oil and chips with nuts			2
but it 's crucial that we all try , says @entity72 , @entity47 , founding director of the @entity73 : " the @entity74 has projected that one in three @entity3 will have diabetes by 2050			2
" message received ! so i took a look at a few key regions to see which habits we @entity3 could make our own			2
@entity82 women stay slim with petite portions according to the best seller " @entity82 women do n't get fat " by @entity87 , the paradox of how @entity82 women consume butter and cream without gaining can be explained in two words : portion control			1
they have small amounts of fresh , quality food and antioxidant - rich wine , lingering over multiple courses and savoring every bite			2
@entity82 women also tend to walk everywhere instead of attempting to get to the gym			1
" in @entity82 , they climb stairs			1
many of the buildings are older and do n't have elevators , " says @entity98 , @entity47 , professor of preventive medicine at @entity99 in @entity100 and coauthor of " 30 @entity103 's @entity102			2
" @entity0 : little ways to lose big pounds plus , the price of gas is a lot higher , so people are motivated to walk instead of drive			1
all of this adds up to @entity82 women having a low incidence of heart disease and obesity ( 12 % compared to the @entity3 's 36 % )			1
i admire the @entity82 " food is the focus " idea , in theory			1
if only i could while away the afternoon strolling from boulangerie to fromagerie			2
but as a working mother of two teenagers , i scramble to pull off a 30 - minute meal			2
and that 's ok , @entity98 says : " even if it 's quick , a homemade meal with whole ingredients is better than going to a restaurant with huge portions and empty calories			2
" @entity135 eat farm to table the traditional northern @entity139 food philosophy is to eat what you -- or someone nearby -- grew or gathered			2
the key words are local and fresh			2

the @entity154 diet and way of life produces low rates of obesity ( as low as 8 % , depending on the country )			1
despite scarce sunlight , @entity51 and @entity135 people actually suffer from depression less than @entity3 , possibly due to all those omega - 3s			2
@entity0 : @entity165 or just sad ? 7 signs of seasonal affective disorder in @entity135 , there 's also a physical component to producing food			0
" they expend energy growing and gathering , " explains @entity170 , @entity171 , a senior nutrition scientist for the @entity170 in @entity173 " but that is n't feasible in many regions in @entity3			0
" if backyard gardening is n't possible for you , even a weekend apple - or berry - picking trip will connect you to your food and is a good workout to boot			0
the @entity20 value family connections @entity185 , a @entity20 island region , is known to have the highest concentration of centenarians ( people aged 100 or older ) in the world			1
compared to @entity3 , they have an 80 % lower rate of breast cancer death and less than half the rate of ovarian or colon cancer deaths			1
they also have much lower rates of dementia and a lower risk of heart disease			1
how they do it : on @entity185 , they practice hara hachi bu , or eating until 80 % full			1
a spiritual lifestyle that includes prayer and meditation seems to reduce stress -- and possibly ailments related to it			0
low cancer rates are believed to be due to a high - fiber plant - based diet of rice , soy , cruciferous and sea vegetables , fruit , omega - 3 - rich fatty fish , and only a tiny bit of dairy and meat			1
@entity0 : 6 cancer - fighting superfoods just as crucial is a sense of connection and community			0

as we 've heard before , this diet includes good fats ( olive oil , nuts , fish ) , lean proteins , antioxidant - rich fruits and vegetables , and a moderate amount of wine			1
of course , it 's all about knowing when to say basta -- enough			0
" eat like an @entity40 " does n't mean diving into a never - ending pasta bowl			0
@entity29 adds , " in blue zones like the island of @entity269 in @entity41 , you find extended families under one roof making family meals			0
" what 's more , activity is a part of daily life -- " not something to suffer through at the gym			1

one trick for slashing portions : " instead of putting big platters of food at the center of the table , fill each plate at the counter , " @entity29 says			0
not only are plant - based diets rich in antioxidants and other good - for - you nutrients , they 're also better for your waistline			0
" a plate of food in @entity185 has one - fifth the calorie density of a typical @entity3 meal , " @entity29 says			1
" you can chow down for a fraction of the calories			0
" @entity29 suggests thinking of meat as a condiment rather than the main event , and subbing in more beans , legumes , and nuts			0
learn to love the foods that love you back			0
a diet of berries and elk or tofu and sea vegetables might seem utterly foreignâ € ” but taste buds can be retrained			1
" @entity3 love fat , salt , and sugar because that 's what 9 of 10 we 're used to , " @entity72 says			0
" but studies show that if you eat more wholesome foods , you can learn to prefer them			0
