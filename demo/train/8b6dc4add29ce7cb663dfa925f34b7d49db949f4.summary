@entity0 , @entity1 -- the judge declared a mistrial in the sham marriage trial of @entity7 soap opera actress @entity6 on friday after jurors said they were deadlocked with no hope of agreeing			1
the @entity12 attorney 's office did not immediately say if the case will be retried , but the judge set a hearing for january to discuss the case			2
a defense lawyer said the @entity6 was disappointed that the prosecution of her may continue			1
it was a trial filled with so many twists and turns that the judge compared it to a soap opera			2
most of the 12 jurors individually told the judge on thursday that they could not reach a verdict unless he replaced a " hostile " member of the jury			1
the juror was kept on the panel			2
" it would be extremely difficult , " one male juror told the judge			1
@entity12 district judge @entity35 decided not to remove the woman and instead ordered jurors to keep trying			1
ultimately , they could not decide if @entity6 married @entity39 , a pizza delivery man and musician , for love or for a @entity12 work visa			1
jurors heard the tearful testimony of the actress proclaiming love for her husband , along with evidence she engaged in a romance with a photographer less than a year after her wedding			1
the prosecutor argued @entity6 paid @entity39 $ 5,000 to be her husband in june 2005 so she could get a @entity12 work visa			1
" why would anybody have to be paid to marry her ? " asked defense lawyer @entity55 , pointing to the beautiful actress - singer - model			1
@entity6 and @entity39 were both 23 when they had a @entity0 wedding			1
only the bride 's mother and a handful of others attended , but @entity6 said a larger wedding was impossible because he is a @entity66 and she 's a devout @entity67			1
there was no honeymoon , which special assistant u.s. attorney @entity70 argued was evidence of a sham marriage			2
" you 'd figure they could go somewhere , @entity77 , @entity78 , " @entity70 said during closing arguments wednesday			0
they did have pictures together , which the prosecution suggested were staged to present to immigration officials who would decide on her green card			1
when immigration agents conducted a surprise " bed check " at @entity6 's @entity0 apartment in october 2007 they found her , but not him			1
they found @entity39 at a @entity92 apartment , they testified			0
@entity6 testified that she really loved @entity39 when they got married and she intended to build a life with him			1
the first months were " very loving , fun , " she said			0
" we socialized together , passionate			0
it was the honeymoon stage , " she said			0
but his drinking and late night cavorting split them just seven months after their wedding , she said			0
" we started to fight a lot , sweat a lot , throw things			0
it was not healthy , " @entity6 said			1
her defense lawyer argued jurors only have to conclude that the marriage was real when it began			2
" there are all kinds of marriages , " @entity55 said			0
" no one else knows if people are in love			0
" the case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases			0
judge @entity121 blocked the defense from using much of the evidence they said would show it was only investigated because @entity6 was turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances			1
she met @entity130 at a @entity92 casting call about the same time her marriage was " on the rocks , " she said			0
@entity130 , a 49 - year - old @entity135 native , is the star of his own reality tv show -- @entity139 's " @entity138			0
" @entity6 said the relationship initially was " professional and creative , " but she eventually engaged in a " short affair " with @entity130 as he helped with her modeling career			1
" i felt very pressured and i was vulnerable , " @entity6 said as she cried			1
" it was the biggest mistake i 've done in my life			0
" her friendship with @entity130 turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair , she said			2
" mr. @entity130 wanted more and more and he knew i was n't able to give it to him , " she said			0
@entity130 threatened to turn her in to immigration officials , she said			0
" he was losing it , he was very psycho , " @entity6 said			1
" i was very scared , because he would n't stop			0
" the federal complaint against @entity6 said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by @entity130			1
when @entity130 testified for the prosecution last week , he said it was " completely incorrect " that his motivation was to get @entity6 deported			1
instead , the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against @entity162 , the founder and owner of the @entity165 fashion company , @entity130 said			0
the criminal complaint named @entity162 as a target of the federal investigation , alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while @entity6 was modeling for his company			2
@entity130 said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared @entity130 might be extorted by @entity162			0
" my case has never been against @entity6 , " @entity130 said after his testimony			2
" i wish her the best			0
" they could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted , though such cases usually produce shorter sentences , according to the prosecutor			0
