-- army sgt. @entity2 's release from @entity4 captivity was largely celebrated at first			1
in the ensuing days , however , several serious issues have arisen , bearing upon death , honor and the law			0
were @entity10 soldiers killed searching for @entity11 sgt. @entity2 ? a controversy exists over whether soldiers were killed , directly or indirectly , in the search for @entity2 after he was taken captive by the @entity4			1
former soldiers involved in the operations to find @entity2 asserted to @entity0 this week that at least six soldiers were killed because of the search for @entity2 in 2009			1
they provided the soldiers ' names and their dates of death , with circumstances for some of them			0
a day later , @entity26 , a former member of @entity2 's battalion who searched for him that summer in 2009 , wrote in the @entity28 that eight soldiers ' deaths were tied to the @entity2 search			1
@entity26 provided the eight soldiers ' names -- including six names that @entity0 earlier reported			0
asked about this point , defense secretary @entity34 told reporters wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find @entity2			1
@entity2 's former team leader , @entity42 , told @entity0 that , " i ca n't say for a fact and i do n't know if there is really anyone who can prove that soldiers died on a directed mission to find @entity2			1
however every mission , especially in the following two or more months , those were directed missions			0
everything after that , they were still missions that were in search of @entity2			1
... @entity2 leaving changed the mission			2
" @entity2 : strong , well - rounded and easy to talk to , friends say did @entity2 desert ? an @entity11 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded that @entity2 left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will , according to a @entity10 military official briefed on the report			2
the official spoke to @entity0 tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information			0
there was no definitive finding @entity2 deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something @entity11 officials could n't do without talking to the soldier			2
the investigation included interviews with members of @entity2 's unit , none of whom reported seeing him go , the official said			1
it is " unfair " to @entity2 and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base , @entity83 said wednesday			1
secretary of the army @entity89 said tuesday that " a comprehensive , coordinated " review of @entity2 's case will be conducted			1
the review " will include speaking with sgt. @entity2 to better learn from him the circumstances regarding his disappearance and captivity , " @entity89 said			2
earlier in the week , @entity83 declined to address directly detailed questions about @entity2 's case -- particularly accusations that he deserted , as some of his former brothers - in - arm allege			1
before he went missing , @entity2 spoke of wanting to get lost in the mountains and walking to @entity105 , his comrades said			1
" i believe he totally deserted , " said former staff sgt. @entity106 , @entity2 's former squad leader			1
did @entity108 break the law ? the @entity4 freed @entity2 in exchange for the @entity10 release of five @entity4 fighters held in @entity113 , but the @entity108 administration did n't tell @entity115 of the releases			1
under law , the @entity117 has to give a 30 - day notice to @entity120 before any terrorists are transferred from @entity113			0
@entity117 national security adviser @entity122 defended president @entity108 's decision not to notify @entity115			1
" given the acute urgency of the health condition of sergeant @entity2 , and given the president 's constitutional responsibilities , it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30 - day notification requirement , because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get sergeant @entity2 would have been lost , " @entity124 said			1
the president did indeed break the letter of the law , said @entity135 , a law professor at @entity136			2
but there are questions about the law itself , he added			0
" there 's two different questions here			0
one is , did he violate the federal law ? the answer to that is most obviously yes , " @entity135 said			2
" the second question is whether that law is constitutional			0
and the answer to that is more difficult			0
" this is just a notice requirement			0
there are thousands of such notice requirements			0
and the problem with the president 's argument is there 's no limiting principle , that he could argue that all national security laws could fall into the same unilateral power , " @entity135 said			0
@entity159 wanted tougher deal for @entity2 did @entity2 help the @entity4 ? there 's no evidence that @entity2 helped the enemy directly , though he 's certainly been used in @entity4 propaganda			1
what has partly fueled this accusation is how @entity2 reportedly had sent e-mails to his parents denouncing @entity10 activities in @entity170 , according to a 2012 story in @entity173 magazine			2
@entity2 's former comrades also wondered if he gave the @entity4 intelligence because the enemy executed " very calculated , very methodical " strikes after @entity2 's disappearance , said former @entity11 sgt. @entity42			1
but a @entity10 official who has been briefed on the initial @entity11 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after @entity2 disappeared told @entity0 that @entity2 's commanders referred to him as " a good soldier " in that report			1
some of his teammates said he had expressed " boredom " and thought his unit was too passive and should have been " kicking down doors , " the official said			0
@entity4 video shows @entity2 's release in @entity170 was @entity2 tortured ? it 's too early to say how severely @entity2 was mistreated during his five years of captivity			1
officials have yet to state the findings of their medical examination of @entity2 following his release saturday			2
a @entity4 propaganda video of the handover of @entity2 showed him looking gaunt and blinking repeatedly -- as if in disbelief or shock			2
" he does n't look that bad to me , " remarked @entity200 , a former @entity201 lead international hostage negotiator , about @entity2 's condition			1
some experts speculate @entity2 may have experienced @entity206 , in which he may have emotionally bonded with his @entity4 captors over the five years			2
why is his unit coming out against him ? there 's something new and something old motivating the former members of @entity2 's unit to condemn him			1
first there were the immediate reports that @entity2 was being hailed as a hero			2
those accounts incensed the former soldiers			0
the comrades also remembered 2009 and how they searched for @entity2			1
" he walked off , " former @entity220			0
@entity221 , 27 , of @entity222 said			0
" he left his guard post			0
nobody knows if he defected or he 's a traitor or he was kidnapped			0
what i do know is , he was there to protect us , and instead he decided to defer from @entity10 and go and do his own thing			0
i do n't know why he decided to do that , but we spent so much of our resources , and some of those resources were soldiers ' lives			0
" in fact , the former soldiers say they are so outraged that they are speaking out publicly at significant peril			0
the former servicemen said they earlier signed nondisclosure agreements about the disappearance and search for @entity2 , but they 're now violating it			1
opinion : five tough ethics issues in @entity2 swap is that illegal ? the former soldiers may well be in open violation of that contract			2
but they say they will risk punishment			0
" it 's certainly a possibility , but i do n't think that i could have continued to go on without being able to share with you and the people the true things that happened in this situation , because if you guys are n't made aware of it , it will just go on , he will be a hero , and nobody is going to be able to know the truth , " said former @entity11 sgt. @entity251 , whose back is tattooed with the names of three soldiers who purportedly died while searching for @entity2			1
@entity11 officials did n't immediately return a @entity0 request for comment about what consequences , if any , the former soldiers may face if they 're in violation of a nondisclosure agreement			2
for those former troops , honor is at stake			0
" for me , he 's a deserter			0
@entity10 needs to know , " said @entity106 , the former squad leader			0
" he 's back , and he needs to be held accountable			0
" was @entity2 swap legal ? depends on who you ask official : @entity11 will review freed soldier @entity2 's case but it 's not first priority @entity2 hurts @entity108 's most promising chance to close @entity113 @entity0 's @entity290 and @entity291 contributed to this report .			1
