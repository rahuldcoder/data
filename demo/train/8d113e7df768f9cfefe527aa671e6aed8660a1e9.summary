a @entity1 group says it will file a formal complaint with federal regulators against three @entity5 organizations after a @entity7 investigation revealed that they shared internal polling data before the midterm elections by posting the information on anonymous @entity12 accounts			1
the liberal advocacy group @entity13 alleged in a complaint meant to be filed monday to the @entity15 that the @entity16 , the @entity17 and @entity18 broke federal rules that prohibit coordination between campaign committees and outside groups			1
" the @entity16 and outside groups appear to have engaged in illegal coordination through sharing internal polling data , " according to the complaint , which was provided to @entity7 by @entity13			1
" by hiding their communications on a public website , respondents intentionally tried to create a loophole in the coordination rules			0
such an intentional effort to knowingly flout campaign finance laws can not be condoned			2
" the complaint is based on a @entity7 report that detailed how the groups provided valuable polling data by posting it on @entity12 accounts in a secret code			1
even though the posts were gibberish without the code , posting the information on a public website could have provided a work - around to @entity15 anti-coordination rules and regulations that require outside polling data shared with campaign committees to be reported as a donation			1
coordination could allow campaigns , which can not accept unlimited donations , to unfairly use the resources of outside groups , which can accept unlimited and anonymous donations			2
but the @entity58 complaint argues that since the @entity12 accounts could only be found and understood by those with prior knowledge of their existence , the activities do n't meet the threshold of being considered " public			1
" further , according to the complaint , allowing the tactic would " send a dangerous message to candidates " that they can skirt election rules by encrypting the information shared			1
" if the @entity15 were to find that respondents did not engage in illegal coordination , then it would be sending the dangerous message to candidates , party committees , and outside organizations that they can coordinate their efforts so long as they nest their communications — no matter how cryptic or hidden — in a publicly available forum , " the complaint reads			2
" this is the wrong outcome			0
" spokespeople for the @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 did not respond to a request for comment			0
@entity5 are n't the only ones using @entity12 to communicate between groups that technically should n't be coordinating			1
last week the @entity88 revealed that the @entity89 had used a @entity12 account to aggregate details about where they would place ad buys			2
the @entity1 account differed from the @entity5 ones in that it clearly labeled the intent of the profile and provided the code for how to decipher the tweets			1
a @entity89 spokesman confirmed that they had used the account during the 2012 election , but that the information posted was already publicly available anyway			0
republicans used at least two @entity12 accounts to transmit polling data			1
one account used the name @entity110 , a character from the tv show @entity111 who advocated the use of soft money to influence elections			0
campaign finance law experts told @entity7 that even the posts disguised with a secret code could be legal because of the public nature of the communications			2
" it may bend common sense , but not necessarily the law , " said @entity121 , a professor of @entity122 at @entity123 , told @entity7			0
" a lot of things you and i would consider coordination are not coordination under the law			0
i do n't think sharing polling data is going to be enough to establish that the campaign was materially involved in decisions about content , target audience or timing			0
" it is unclear whether the @entity15 , which will hold a hearing to determine whether to issue new campaign finance rules in february , will respond to the complaint			2
officials from the commission said they could not comment on specific cases , but one commissioner told @entity7 that past lack of action from the agency has emboldened groups to stretch the boundaries of the law			0
" the reality is i think there are a lot of people out there who have a fair degree of confidence that there is n't going to be any serious enforcement at the @entity15 so they can pretty much get away with whatever they want , " @entity15 commissioner @entity154 told @entity7			0
" it 's a very sad state of affairs			0

a @entity1 group filed a complaint against the @entity5 for using @entity12 to secretly communicate
@entity5 groups used the accounts to send messages between campaign committees and outside groups
experts are divided on the legality
