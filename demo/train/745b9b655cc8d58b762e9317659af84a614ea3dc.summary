-- @entity3 , under its untested young leader @entity1 , has ratcheted up the threats toward @entity5 and the @entity6 to unprecedented levels and with greater intensity than ever before			1
a torrent of threats has flowed from @entity3 spokesmen , including a promise of preemptive nuclear strikes on the @entity6 and calls to " break the waists of the crazy enemies , totally cut their windpipes and thus clearly show them what a real war is like			2
" @entity3 brinkmanship , bluff , and bluster are stock elements in its diplomatic toolkit , but why have the threats become so outsized , and how worried should we be ? is @entity3 playing the same game it has always played , or does the now - nuclear playbook of a rash young leader represent a new threat the we can not afford to ignore ? threats of annihilation normal for @entity5 in some respects , we have seen this movie before			1
@entity3 has long used its bluff and bluster as a form of self - defense to keep potential enemies off guard , to strengthen internal political control , magnify external threats to promote national unity , and to symbolically express dissatisfaction when international trends are not going its way			2
this year , converging factors are squeezing @entity3 , creating a stronger - than - usual response in the face of seemingly greater international pressure			0
the @entity54 resolution passing financial sanctions on @entity3 following its satellite and nuclear tests were tougher than expected , and coincide with @entity6 - @entity5 military exercises organized to show political resolve to deter @entity3 aggression			1
the establishment of a @entity54 @entity62 into @entity3 's human rights situation tarnishes the standing of the new leadership			0
@entity3 's over-the - top responses belie a sense of vulnerability			0
@entity3 has a record of testing the mettle of each new @entity5 leader through threats and provocation in an apparent hazing ritual that also determines its strategies toward the @entity5			1
@entity5 has responded threat for threat in recent weeks to signal to @entity3 that it will not be blackmailed by its neighbor 's seeming nuclear advantage			2
recent @entity5 media reports of military plans to target thousands of statues of @entity83 and @entity84 in @entity3 are virtually guaranteed to throw @entity3 into a frenzy of effort to defend and show loyalty to the @entity1 family leadership			1
@entity3 's threats : five things to know but the intensity and frequency of threats in @entity1 's first year of leadership is uncomfortably high , raising questions about whether junior @entity1 fully understands the ritualistic rules of the inter-korean " threat - down " ; whether he might be more accepting of risks than his father , and whether he 's more likely to make miscalculations that could drive a hair - trigger situation over the edge			1
moreover , no one can be sure whether internal political challenges or a need to consolidate political control are driving young @entity1 to walk even closer to the edge than usual			2
@entity3 has historically employed guerrilla - style methods in carrying out provocations , using elements of surprise and ambiguity of attribution to avoid risks of full - scale escalation			0
if @entity3 decides to follow through on its threats through direct confrontation , however , this would be evidence that something is going terribly wrong inside its new leadership			0
how can @entity3 's frenzy of threats be brought under control ? past behavior shows a pattern of threats followed by diplomatic " charm offensives " designed to ease tensions and reap diplomatic gains in an environment of general relief that the situation has calmed down			0
analysis : what 's @entity1 up to ? although @entity5 and the @entity6 are weary of this game , @entity5 has started to provide opportunities for @entity3 to climb down as spring military exercises start to wrap up			1
the new @entity5 government has separated humanitarian aid from nuclear weapons negotiations , and president @entity143 has patiently held out an olive branch in the form of her " trustpolitik " policy , which promises step - by - step efforts to stabilize inter-korean relations			0
given the @entity3 leadership 's contradictory need for @entity5 to be both an enemy and a source of economic assistance , this might prove to be the more difficult phase in dealing with @entity3 as its well - worn strategy of alternating threat and diplomacy continues to yield diminishing returns			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity165 : @entity1 ratchets up threats toward @entity5 and @entity6 to record level
@entity163 : @entity169 , followed by " charm offensive , " is *typical* strategy but @entity1 gets closer to brink
we do *n't* know what @entity1 is trying to prove , @entity163 says , or what political events drive him
@entity163 : @entity5 and @entity6 are tired of chest - thumping and it 's not working *anymore*
