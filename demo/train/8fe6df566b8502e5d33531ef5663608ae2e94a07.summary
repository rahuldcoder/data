-- as she approaches the fifth anniversary of the accident that paralyzed her , record - breaking @entity2 gold medallist @entity1 is in defiant mood			1
the 23 - year - old is determined january 21 will not be a day tainted with bitterness ; instead she will focus on the string of seismic achievements she has made since her life was irreparably altered			1
the current holder of 15 swimming world records refuses to accept the normal limits associated with disability , underlined by her latest conquest -- skiing			2
growing up in @entity19 , @entity1 says she used to dread the complexities thrown up by heavy snow that sometimes lingers for months , but after taking to the slopes in @entity23 , @entity24 , she feels she 's reclaimed another slice of independence			1
" it 's been fun to be out there on the snow again and not be confined to four wheels , " @entity1 told @entity0 from the slopes in @entity24			1
" i 'm reaching my five year anniversary of my paralysis in january and i have n't been able to enjoy winter yet			1
i grew up in @entity19 , with snow all around for a good six months of the year			2
" five years ago when this happened i did n't obviously think i 'd be up skiing on a mountain and i definitely did n't know what my life would look like five years from that point			2
" i try not to look at the anniversary - january 21st - as a sad or depressing day , or look at it for what i lost			1
i try to look at everything i 've accomplished and gained and all the opportunities i 've had			2
" i still truly believe the life i 've lived since becoming paralyzed is far fuller than the life i may have lived if i was n't paralyzed			2
" i 'd done a little bit of skiing before i was paralyzed and i wanted to be able to find a way to enjoy snow again , to enjoy the winter months			1
i used to dread them			2
" @entity1 was only 19 when she became paralyzed from the waist down			1
a routine epidural injection during a bout of shingles went wrong and changed the course of her life forever			2
unbowed she has spent the last half decade smashing down the barriers most people assume are erected the instant such a tragedy occurs			2
within four months of the accident , the 23 - year - old was back in the pool and about to launch a new career that would see her claim 13 gold medals at the 2009 and @entity65			1
as well as her world records she also holds 34 @entity68 records			1
@entity1 seems to take disappointment in her stride			1
despite having her disability reclassified by the event 's governing body on the eve of the @entity2 last year , @entity1 absorbed the blow and took her first gold medal at the @entity77 in the 50m freestyle , also adding a bronze in the 4x100m medley			1
her foray into the world of skiing is just the latest challenge she has overcome , as she works her way down a list that might deter even the fittest able - bodied athlete			1
armed only with a mono ski , and two hand skis , @entity1 had completed just one day of training with @entity91 -- an instructor at @entity92 -- before she was let loose on the slope 's quickest runs			1
@entity91 says the mental fortitude of his apprentice was unlike any he has come across before			0
" @entity1 is by far the best student i 've ever had , " he said			1
" she 's just a natural athlete			0
she 's amazing and has the right attitude to go far			0
" we were already on the top of the mountain on her second day of skiing			0
i think besides being physically in shape , mentality is the most important thing			0
@entity1 's approach to it has helped her get the hang of it really quickly			1
" she 's absolutely amazing ; i could only hope to be as dedicated as she is			0
she 's the sort of person that if you put a barrier in front of her she 'll go and smash it down			0
i think if people watch her and see what she does it can be an amazing motivator for them			0
" @entity1 does not just accept her position as a role model , she embraces it			1
" i had a lot of people tell me about things i would never do again , " she explained			0
" it was one of those moments when i realized the only person who can put restrictions on me is me			0
" i almost became a bit more hungry for life in general			0
all of a sudden my ambition changed , my drive , my passion , ever since that day i 've had a change in perspective , to live everything to the full and take advantage of all these opportunities			0
" there are a lot of things out there i want to try that i did n't know that i had the desire to do before i was paralyzed			0
one of the big things i want to do is to try and raise awareness , to show what individuals with disabilities can do			0
" it 's raising awareness that our life is n't any different and we as individuals are not different			0
i think our society puts that on disability and focuses on what people ca n't do , but we can do those things , we might do them differently , but we can do them			0
" it 's my hope in doing things like this , that i can encourage not only our society to feel differently but hopefully raise awareness so other individuals with disabilities can see the opportunities they have as well			0
" so now the skiing box has been ticked , what is next on @entity1 's to - do list ? " i 'd love to find a way to walk with leg braces and arm crutches , " she said			1
" i do n't have any function in my legs but i know there 's a way you can do it using your abs , so walking is definitely on my list in this next year			2
" i 'm getting ready to go scuba diving in the spring for the first time since being paralyzed and down the road one of my really big goals is to climb @entity187			1
" my dad is an avid mountain climber and he 's scaled various different mountains			0
i 'd love to get my dad back on a mountain and do it with him			0
the list is quite long ! "			0
