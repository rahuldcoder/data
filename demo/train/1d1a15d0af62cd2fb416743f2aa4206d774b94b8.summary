-- @entity1 may be a country boy at heart , but he is also pretty savvy when it comes to navigating @entity4			1
@entity1 has a full plate with acting , touring , composing and being a dad			1
when others wrote him off as a novelty act after the 1992 hit " @entity10 , " @entity1 kept making music and eventually turned to acting			1
it was a decision he said came after some well - timed fatherly advice			1
" in the mid- ' 90s , my dad said to me ' son , you 've got all of your eggs in one basket and you are living and dying by music , ' " @entity1 recalled			1
" he said ' i want you to have a career like @entity21			0
' " @entity1 said his dad suggested he branch out into acting			1
@entity1 eventually auditioned for and won a role in what appeared to be an unlikely vehicle -- @entity28 's 2001 film " @entity29			1
" after @entity28 , known for such works as " @entity31 " and " @entity32 , " suggested that @entity1 should continue to pursue the craft , he went on to star in the television drama " @entity35 , " which also helped spur the career of @entity1 ' greatest production -- " @entity40 " star , and @entity1 ' daughter , @entity39			1
now , with the release of " @entity40 : @entity42 " on blu - ray and dvd , a music tour and an upcoming role in a film featuring comedian @entity48 and martial arts expert @entity49 , @entity1 is staying busy			1
he recently took some time out of his hectic schedule to talk to @entity0 about how he keeps it all together , how he manages raising a family full of performers ( son trace is a member of the band @entity57 , daughter @entity59 performs with the band @entity61 and @entity62 and also acts , as do younger children @entity64 and @entity65 ) and what makes him a good fit for @entity4			0
@entity0 : what do you like about " @entity40 : the movie ? " @entity1 : i think it 's got a certain amount of realism to it with art imitating life imitating art. it certainly parallels a lot of things in mine and @entity39 's real world and real lives			1
i wrote the song " back to @entity84 " and as i read the script for the movie , " back to @entity84 " became a cornerstone of the film and the title track off the album			0
the realism of the film translates into the music , and i think vice versa			2
@entity0 : the film speaks to never losing touch with your roots			0
how important is that to you ? @entity1 : extremely			1
my dad told me as a kid to always be aware of where you are , always have a vision for your future , but never forget where you came from			0
@entity0 : you 've had careers in both music and acting			2
do you still feel a bit like a fish out of water dealing with @entity4 ? @entity1 : i love @entity4 as far as being an actor			2
getting to work with @entity49 and @entity48 in this new film we have coming out in january [ " @entity117 " ] , working with @entity118 and @entity119 in the @entity121 movie " @entity122 " and @entity123 , who has appeared as my deceased wife on " @entity40			2
" i look back at it now and think that i may fit in more to the film community than i do @entity128 , to tell you the truth			0
i love what i do			0
@entity0 : do you have a preference , then , for acting over music ? @entity1 : my preference is to find projects that can combine the two			1
i also love to write scores			0
i wrote a lot of the scores for " @entity35 " and i love to write scores for other projects			2
@entity0 : how do you balance being a star with being a dad ? @entity1 : the very best i can			2
i just take it one step at a time and do the best i can			0
my dad was to me what i try to be to @entity39 , which is somewhat of a best friend			0
i try my best to be a good daddy and if she wants to talk about business or music i try my best to be a good manager			2
i try to be all of those things because that 's what my dad was to me			0
unfortunately , my dad passed away four years ago from mesothelioma , but i feel like in some ways my dad is looking down on me and smiling			0
his name was @entity164 and a lot of people say @entity39 changed her name to @entity168 because of @entity1 , but that 's not true			1
she did that in honor of my dad , because the two of them just loved each other to pieces			0
@entity0 : so will @entity39 ever remake " @entity10 " ? @entity1 : i doubt it , but anything is a possibility			1
in 1991 i recorded " @entity10 " and we are not too terribly far away from the 20 - year anniversary , and there are some major stars who want to re-do that song			1
i 'm flirting with the idea			0
there 's one cat in particular that if i told you who it was , it would blow your mind			0
but i 've got to keep it under my hat right now .			0
