-- we all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control : commutes back up , smog thickens , and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces			1
the oceans are growing crowded , and governments are increasingly trying to plan their use			1
but what about " ocean sprawl " ? until recently , no one gave that idea much thought			1
but the oceans , like the land , have gotten crowded , and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public - owned seas from turning into sprawling , watery versions of @entity27 , @entity28 , or @entity29 , @entity30			1
" the oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development , " said @entity31 , ocean policy director at the @entity32 , an advocacy group			1
" even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish			1
we know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world			0
" in an attempt to address this and other crowding problems , governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters			1
the @entity50 administration on june 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning			1
by september , the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that 's designed to protect ocean ecology , address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies			1
a handful of states , including @entity61 and @entity62 , are charting similar courses			0
@entity61 on june 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters , which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year			1
one of the state 's main aims is to make space for two @entity71 wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state 's waters -- without angering fishing industries , killing whales or harming ecosystems			0
internationally , several @entity78 countries , including @entity79 , @entity80 , the @entity81 and @entity82 , are pioneering the new field , said @entity84 , a co-principal investigator at @entity86 's @entity85			0
ocean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming			1
one reason it 's taken so long is that people ca n't see that the oceans are filling up , said @entity93 , a marine biologist and senior adviser at the @entity95 , an environmental group			1
" the majority of the ecosystem is under the water , " @entity93 said			0
" so it 's out of sight , out of mind			0
we 're only looking at the surface			0
" beneath the water , though , overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse			0
by one report , wild fish could disappear by mid-century			0
the energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water			0
shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales			0
fish farms are growing in some countries			1
climate change is altering ocean chemistry			1
and power lines , reefs , lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space			0
in @entity78 's @entity126 , expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available , said @entity84 , of @entity86			2
what happens on land also affects the oceans			2
a 2003 report by the @entity133 says that each year , coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near - coast fish habitat			2
furthermore , pavement on land creates " expressways " for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean			1
" every eight months , nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the @entity149 , " the report says			0
when the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea , the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan , said @entity93 , of the @entity95			1
" there 's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy , " she said , " but it 's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way , because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans			1
" since there are new uses but not new space , planning is necessary , said @entity167 , another co-principal investigator at the @entity85			0
he added , " there 's not enough space for everything , and there are going to have to be trade - offs that are made			0
" current efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts , @entity167 said			0
until now , the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of " free - for - all " in which " whoever gets there first gets the access , " he said			2
@entity183 , of the @entity32 , said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the @entity187 contributes to the problem			2
more than 140 federal laws govern the ocean 's use ; and six federal departments , along with dozens of agencies , are in charge of implementing those laws , according to the @entity133 report			2
@entity197 , a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the @entity199 , said @entity50 's ocean - planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking			1
" we 're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways , " he said			2
" they all have standing , and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably			0
" he added , " fifty years from now , you should be able to go to a place [ in the ocean ] and know what will be happening there			2
" there are skeptics of the shift			0
commercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups , said @entity222 , president of @entity223 , an industry group			1
" we make our livelihoods from that ocean , and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place , " he said			2
some other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses , like offshore wind energy , entirely			2
despite this new emphasis on planning , there 's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities			0
" the proof will be in the pudding , " said @entity197 , of @entity199			0
but he said it 's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking			0
" if we do our jobs right , overall , the oceans will be healthier , ecosystems will be more productive , people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems , " he said , " and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work			1

the oceans are growing crowded , and some scientists worry about " ocean sprawl "
for the first time , governments plan ocean use in a comprehensive way
advocate says oceans are the " last frontier for use and development "
