-- for 16 glorious years , i taught 11th - graders at a magnet high school in @entity4			1
for me , teaching was n't about making a living			1
nothing made me happier or more content than standing in front of a classroom and sharing the works of writers such as @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 and watching my students " catch " my passion for language and literature			1
i loved watching these 15 - and 16 - year - olds grapple with their first major life decisions -- future careers , relationships , where to live , which colleges to attend , what to study -- at the same moment they 're learning to drive and getting their first jobs and experimenting with identity and independence			1
there was n't a day when i did n't feel privileged to be part of their metamorphoses and grateful for the chance to affect their lives			2
my classroom was my sanctuary , so on the day before @entity41 in 2006 when i was diagnosed with an incurable form of brain cancer at 34 and told i had less than a year to live , i did what i always did			1
i needed my students to know that i trusted them enough to share life 's most sacrosanct passage			1
they , in turn , helped me to live in the moment and spend whatever time i had left living well			2
for six years , the only time i was n't in class was when i was undergoing brain surgery			1
i never avoided the topic of my cancer , glioblastoma multiforme , with my students , but it was not something i dwelled on , nor did they			1
i covered my bald , lacerated head with a woolen hat and scheduled chemotherapy around my classes , and i got so good at being sick that i could run to the bathroom , heave into the toilet , flush , brush my teeth and fly back to class in under three minutes			2
they pretended not to notice			0
during that time , i even won " @entity72 " for my region			0
i was grateful for every breath and felt as if i could live that way forever			0
then , two summers ago , the tumor in my head decided to act up			0
i was playing pool with a friend when i was struck with a catastrophic seizure that left me crippled and mostly blind			0
after two months of physical therapy and a grim prognosis for improvement , i was forced to face that i could no longer be the teacher i once was and i tendered my resignation			0
the cancer had finally succeeded in taking me out of the classroom , but i was n't ready to let it take me out of the game			1
i was n't afraid to die			1
i was afraid of living without a purpose			0
to paraphrase @entity91 , a person who has a why to live can always find a how			0
my " why " had always been my students			1
i just needed to find a new " how			0
" since i no longer had a classroom for them to come to me , i decided that i would go to them			1
in september of 2012 , i posted my plan on @entity99			0
i said i wanted to spend whatever time i had left visiting with former students			1
my purpose was to have a chance to see firsthand how my kids were faring and to witness how , if at all , i had helped shape their young lives			0
it was an opportunity that few people ever get , but many , and particularly teachers , would covet			0
within hours of posting , i had invitations from students in more than 50 cities across the country			1
in early november , i set off on my journey , traveling across @entity115 by bus , by train , just me and my red - tipped cane			0
over the next three months , i traveled more than 8,000 miles from @entity4 to @entity119 , to @entity115 's heartland and @entity122 's @entity121 , visiting hundreds of my former students along the way			1
i had hoped i would discover that i 'd instilled in at least some of them a lasting love of books and literature , and a deep curiosity about the world			0
but what my trip taught me was something even more gratifying			2
what i learned from my travels was that my students had grown up to be kind and caring people			1
people who picked me up when i fell over curbs , read to me from books i could no longer see , and cut my food when i could not grasp a knife			0
they shared with me their deepest secrets , introduced me to their families and friends , sang to me my favorite songs and recited my favorite poetry			0
as i had hoped , they recalled favorite lessons and books from class , but , to my great surprise , it was our personal time together that seemed to have meant the most to them			2
those brief , intimate interludes between lessons when we shared heartaches and vulnerabilities and victories were the times my students remembered			2
and it was through them i realized that those very human moments , when we connected on a deep and personal level , were what made my life feel so rich , then and now			1
my students had taught me the greatest lesson of all			1
they taught me that what matters is not so much about what we learn in class , but what we feel in our hearts			2
i am a pragmatic man			2
i know there is no reason i should still be alive			0
the cancer never lets me forget that it and not i will ultimately win this battle of wills			2
i know the disease will have its way with me , and sooner , rather than later			0
my limbs are withering and my memory is fading			0
yet as my world dims from the tumor growing in my head , i see ever more clearly the gifts the promise of an early death has brought			0
my travels are done , but my students are never more than a phone call or an e-mail or a @entity99 message away			2
and from the lessons i learned on the road , i , to borrow from the great @entity195 , will die feeling like the luckiest man on @entity197			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

@entity200 : i taught 11th grade for 16 years ; teaching was my life and made me happy
@entity200 : after being diagnosed with brain cancer , my classroom was my sanctuary
