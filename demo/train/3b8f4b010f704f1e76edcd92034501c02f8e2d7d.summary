-- taking inspiration from the teenage exploits of @entity5 , already admired by the most successful player of her generation @entity8 and with a bucketful of talent , @entity2 's @entity1 has the world of golf at her feet			1
still only 17 years of age , @entity14 is in her rookie season as a professional -- the @entity18 waiving their age limit of 18 on account of her talent and maturity -- and duly collected her first tournament win at the @entity25 in @entity26 sunday			1
it was not her first success at this level , @entity14 had already claimed the 2012 and 2013 @entity30 crowns while still an amateur , but it was an important milestone at a $ 1.8 million tournament			1
the @entity35 - born @entity34 carded a final round three - under - par 69 at @entity36 to hold off @entity37 of the @entity38 by a shot			2
not only did she pocket $ 270,000 but the victory has lifted her to number two in the world rankings , just three days after her 17th birthday			0
@entity5 fan @entity5 's exploits , even before she reached her teenage years , are well - documented and @entity14 , who first picked up a golf club at just five years of age , quite naturally was a fan			1
" i really look up to @entity5 , " she told @entity0			1
" she had a lot of success and attention at a young age			0
i have been very lucky to spend some time with her on and off the golf course over the last two years and she has been really gracious to me , " she added			0
@entity14 's latest triumph has already lifted her level with @entity5 for all - time career @entity18 wins on three and it 's not hard to predict that there will be many more			1
@entity8 , who won 93 events , including 10 majors , is so impressed with @entity14 that she endorsed the teen phenom for inclusion in @entity67 's lists of the most 100 influential people on the planet			1
she was one of just five from the world of sport , the others gay @entity72 icon @entity71 , @entity74 champion @entity73 , tennis ace @entity75 and @entity77 @entity76			0
it is heady company but her inclusion in the @entity84 section is , according to @entity8 , thoroughly deserved			1
" @entity1 is exceptionally talented , mature beyond her years and well liked by golf fans and competitors alike , " the @entity86 legend wrote in the published citation			2
" she is responsible for sparking increased interest in our sport not just in her native @entity35 and adopted homeland of @entity2 but also among juniors across the globe			0
fantastic job " her early , record - breaking success brings with it incredible pressure â € ” and she 's doing a fantastic job handling the many responsibilities that accompany stardom			2
" quite a compliment and @entity14 admitted that @entity8 and another retired former world number one @entity104 were her idols as she honed her game			1
" for a long time , i looked up to @entity8 and @entity104			2
they did so much for the game and i hope one day i can be remembered like them , " she told @entity0			0
to be mentioned in the same breath , @entity14 will have to claim her share of golf 's majors and came close to claiming her first when runner - up in the @entity116 in @entity117 last year			1
few have any doubt that it is only a matter of time and @entity14 is prepared to be patient in her quest			2
" i think it 's important not to put too much pressure on myself at the majors , though , and continue to approach them in the same manner i always have			2
" last year , aside from @entity116 , i came away from the majors feeling a bit disappointed so there is definitely room for improvement , " she said			2
@entity14 was coached from the start by @entity133 @entity132 , only ending her full - time association with him because of the need for full - time help while playing a full schedule on the @entity18			1
historic wins she won her first professional golf event -- a tournament on her home circuit while still 14 and the following year became the youngest winner of an @entity18 event when she won in @entity144 aged just 15 years and four months			1
it broke the record set by @entity38 @entity147 , but the winners check for $ 300,000 went to @entity35 runner - up @entity149 because @entity14 was still an amateur			1
@entity149 also trailed @entity14 in fourth place at this weekend 's tournament but is now the only player ahead of her in the world rankings			1
@entity155 is only 25 years old and has held the number one status for a year , surely to come under challenge from @entity14 , who was born in @entity159 before her parents emigrated to @entity2 while she was a toddler			1
sporting stars are getting ever younger and @entity14 admits that getting to the top at such a tender age has not been without sacrifices			2
" @entity167 has been my number one priority from a young age so i have certainly missed out on some things back home , " she said			0
missing friends " i do enjoy spending time with my friends and i miss them when i am gone			0
i keep in touch with them over @entity177 and we hang out when i am home			0
" she is hoping her own incredible exploits will encourage others to follow in her footsteps			0
" on a global stage , particularly in women 's golf , the game is really growing and i think many more girls are exposed to golf at a younger age			0
" i just hope i can be a small inspiration to girls in @entity2 and elsewhere			0
" that much is certainly assured but @entity14 's level - headed and mature approach is what has so impressed the likes of @entity8 and other expert observers			1
" i have been very fortunate to achieve success at a young age in golf			0
i realize how lucky i am to pursue the game i love			0
" from a young age , i have had very high expectations of myself on the golf course and while i am proud of the success i have achieved , i know i have a long way to go , " she said			0
@entity207 sums it up succinctly			0
" she 's leading golf 's youth movement			0
