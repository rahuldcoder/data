-- after dodging sharks and jellyfish during her swim from @entity5 to @entity6 , @entity1 is now dealing with a different challenge : tough questions from her fellow marathon swimmers about the legitimacy of her achievement			1
in the days since @entity1 walked out of the water last week at @entity14 after swimming 110 miles , a stream of questions has come at her			1
could her speed have nearly doubled at one point ? did any of her team members touch her or support her ? how could she have gone for hours without food or water ? the questions are significant because the answers could determine whether @entity1 is officially affirmed as the first person to have completed the @entity5 - @entity6 swim unassisted and without a shark cage			1
five thrill - seeking women breaking world records during a conference call with more than a dozen of her peers tuesday , @entity1 was adamant that her swim was by the book			1
" i swam , " she said			0
" we made it , our team , from the rocks of @entity5 to the beach of @entity6 , in squeaky clean , ethical fashion			1
" she said she never held onto a boat or another person " for any kind of flotation or support			2
" her navigator , @entity42 , described how the team picked up a current that had them moving nearly four miles an hour for several hours on the second day of the nearly 53 - hour journey			2
that 's how and when her speed nearly doubled , he said			0
@entity1 's jellyfish - proof face mask ' no handlers ' asked about reports she had gone for hours without food or water , @entity1 said she never went more than 90 minutes			1
getting into the suit that protected her against potentially deadly box jellyfish required duct taping her booties and gloves			0
that meant she was touched , she said , but never supported			0
there were " no handlers grabbing my ankles , " @entity1 said			1
" i was on my own steam entirely , but i was touched			0
" if the group of her swimming peers determines that the suit and the touching mean her swim was assisted , that could nullify her record claim			2
one marathon swimmer who was on the call was unimpressed			0
" she acknowledged that her crew touched her when she was putting on the jellyfish suit , " said @entity72 , a co-founder of @entity73			0
" and i know she feels that was necessary , but i personally feel that puts in the category of an assisted swim			0
" now , @entity1 has to wait to see if the group of her peers agrees with @entity72 , or with her			1
@entity1 shows baby boomers so ' not over '			2

@entity1 completed the 110 - mile swim from @entity5 to @entity6 last week
she says she is the first person to do it unassisted and without a shark cage
but questions have been *raised* about aspects of her swim
she *insists* she did it " in squeaky clean , ethical fashion "
