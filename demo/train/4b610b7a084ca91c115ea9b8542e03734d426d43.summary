@entity1 , @entity0 -- teaching @entity3 is a growing trend across schools in the @entity6 , where the number of students enrolling in @entity10 language and cultural programs has tripled in recent years			1
a school district outside @entity1 , @entity0 , is on track to receive more than $ 1 million in federal grant money for its @entity10 arts and language program			1
but what 's really caught people 's attention is the $ 30,000 that the district is getting from the government of @entity22			1
the @entity23 began teaching @entity10 four years ago and since then , the number of students in the program has increased from about 40 to 350			1
administrators felt @entity22 should have a home in their suburban @entity0 school system since the communist country has the world 's second - largest economy and is becoming increasingly relevant			1
" we owe it to our students so they can be a successful part of the world , " said @entity32 , coordinator for pupil services			0
" and @entity22 will be a major player there			0
" the district has been dubbed a @entity41 , which in a nutshell means it has earned the support of the @entity46			0
the funds will be used , school officials say , to support their visiting teacher from @entity22 and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern @entity10 province of @entity53			1
from @entity55 to @entity56 and many places in between , dozens of public schools have similar relationships with the @entity10 government			1
and the number continues to grow			0
@entity10 student loving life at @entity6 college during his visit to the @entity6 this week , @entity10 president @entity64 plans to visit one such program at the @entity68 school in @entity69			1
the nonprofit @entity70 works , in many instances , with the @entity10 government to help secure new @entity72 and relationships			1
they work with more than 60 schools in the @entity6 @entity76 is a mother of three at @entity79 's schools			1
she and her family moved to the district specifically for the language program			2
" we feel very lucky that we have this , " @entity83 said			0
" i say it 's just like math , @entity89 , art -- it 's as important as anything else			0
" @entity83 added that having guest teachers from @entity22 who are native speakers adds to the experience			2
her son is a sophomore and has taken a serious interest in the language			0
" i 'd have potential to get a job doing translating or interpreting , maybe work for the @entity99 , " said @entity83			0
pop culture helps bridge @entity6 - @entity22 gap @entity102 , who owns a business in @entity0 that regularly does business with @entity22 , said the need for @entity10 speakers is increasing , particuarly because of the small @entity108 population in the @entity109			1
" it 's really been challenging , " she said			0
" schools that offer stuff like this i think are crucial going forward			0
" but the program does n't sit that well with everyone , in part because of the @entity10 government 's role			1
@entity83 said he hears about it " all the time			0
" " i actually have a few friends that are hateful towards the language and the culture , maybe because it 's different , " he said			2
" a lot of @entity6 do n't really know much about @entity10 culture so they see it as alien so it 's bad			1
i think @entity22 has a beautiful culture			2
" teacher @entity130 has also heard some concerns raised about the program			0
" not really often because i think most @entity6 are really polite , " @entity130 said			0
" they would n't just say something like that in front of your face , but there are people who are not willing to open up to other cultures			0
" outside @entity142 , the @entity141 was set to receive similar funds from the @entity10 government through the @entity146 network			1
but backlash from community members who cited " communist propaganda " meant they ultimately had to turn it down			0
" the objection ... was not to the teaching of a foreign language , " said @entity151 , the district 's former superintendent and a vocal opponent of the proposal			2
" the problem here was the culture portion and the involvement with the @entity10 government			1
" @entity151 said he was concerned about impressionable elementary students learning about communism through material provided by the @entity10 government			2
school officials at @entity0 's @entity165 maintain that is not part of their curriculum			1
asked whether they must follow certain guidelines in order to receive the funds , @entity170 said " absolutely not			0
" she added that they would n't have accepted teachers from @entity22 if they came with their own curriculum			2
school administrator @entity32 stressed that a relationship , however small , between @entity22 and the @entity6 will be mutually beneficial in the long run			1
" we do n't agree with everything , how the system works in @entity22 , but hopefully as it opens more and more , which it certainly has , they will become more democratic , they will become more open with less censorship , so you hope that 's all there , " @entity32 said			2
" that does n't mean , though , that if it 's not there yet that our students do n't learn about the culture and do n't learn about the language			2
" parent @entity76 said she is n't bothered one bit by the program being funded by @entity22 's government			1
" i 'm not sure why [ people have problems with it ] , " @entity83 said			0
" it 's wonderful that [ @entity22 is ] reaching out to us and we 're reciprocating			2
i think the more you 're exposed to another culture , the more you understand each other , you 're just a more well - rounded person			0
and i think everybody could use that			0
