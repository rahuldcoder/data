the @entity1 @entity0 on thursday declined to hear an emergency application for a stay filed by a @entity5 deep - sea salvage company that wanted to maintain possession of a half billion dollars worth of gold and silver coins until a final decision is made about who owns them			1
" @entity14 has now been victorious at every level in the @entity1 courts , from @entity18 to @entity19 to @entity20 , " said @entity12 , who defended @entity14 's claim to the treasure			1
" i am pleased and proud for all of us			0
" @entity22 had made an emergency appeal to the high court in an attempt to block a lower court 's order last week that it turn over the treasure to @entity14			1
justice @entity29 , who has jurisdiction over applications from @entity5 , denied without comment the motion in @entity22 v. @entity14			1
the company has filed at least one another stay request with the justices			0
@entity37 , @entity22 's vice president and general counsel , expressed disappointment , but said she recognized that the court " rarely grants " such motions			1
" how we proceed from here will depend on whether a mandate issues and what a subsequent order might look like , especially given the fact that the courts have determined they do not have jurisdiction in the case , " she said in a statement			0
@entity12 said it was unlikely that the @entity0 would review the case			0
" the @entity0 accepts 1 % or less of such requests and today 's decision makes a strong statement about their chances , " he said			0
the dispute goes back to 2007 , when @entity22 announced it had found a 19th - century sunken ship off of @entity14			1
the company claimed ownership of the coins and said it had flown them to a guarded location in the @entity1			1
@entity14 filed suit in a federal court in @entity18 , @entity5 , also claiming the treasure			2
@entity14 says its navy warship @entity68 was carrying the coins			2
the 34 - gun frigate left @entity70 in 1804 and crossed the @entity71 to within a day 's sail from @entity14 when @entity74 ships attacked the @entity14 fleet			2
in the ensuing @entity76 , south of @entity77 , the @entity68 was hit in its powder magazine and exploded , according to the @entity14 government 's filing to the @entity5 court			1
in 2009 , the federal court in @entity18 ruled in favor of @entity14 and the federal appeals court in @entity19 upheld the ruling last september			2
last week , the appeals court denied an @entity22 motion , which @entity22 appealed to the @entity0			1
the appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in @entity18 , which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to @entity14 , @entity12 said last week			1
@entity14 believes that most of the nearly 600,000 coins are currently in @entity5 , @entity12 said			2
@entity14 's culture minister , @entity93 , told @entity94 in @entity95 on wednesday that the case was never really about the money			0
" we 're not going to use this money for purposes other than artistic exhibition , but this is something that enriches our material , artistic capital and it has to be appreciated as such , " @entity93 said in an interview			0
he said the coins would be exhibited at @entity14 museums , and perhaps elsewhere			0
@entity70 , too , has followed the fate of the coins , which came from @entity110 when @entity70 was a @entity14 colony			0
" formally , they have n't claimed anything , but we are completely open to consider the possibility of distributing some part of the treasure also among the @entity110 museums , " @entity93 said			0
the treasure includes fabled " pieces of eight , " some minted in 1803 in @entity120 , @entity70 , @entity14 officials have said .			0
