-- scientific evidence shows that the health benefits of circumcising baby boys outweigh the risks , @entity2 's top pediatrics group said monday			1
but the " benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision , " the @entity7 said in a policy statement , and the decision to circumcise should be up to the parents in consultation with the child 's doctor			2
" scientific research shows clearer health benefits to the procedure than had previously been demonstrated , " said the group , which represents 60,000 pediatricians in the @entity2 and @entity18			1
it also said the health benefits are great enough for insurance coverage			1
a debate has emerged over the practice			0
@entity28 , the removal of the foreskin from the penis , is a religious rite commonly practiced by @entity33 and @entity34 and is a widely accepted and common medical practice			1
but staunch critics of the procedure say it is not medically necessary and carries the risk of complications and pain			0
why i did n't circumcise my sons " scientific research shows clearer health benefits to the procedure than had previously been demonstrated			1
according to a systematic and critical review of the scientific literature , the health benefits of circumcision include lower risks of acquiring @entity51 , genital herpes , human papilloma virus and syphilis			1
circumcision also lowers the risk of penile cancer over a lifetime ; reduces the risk of cervical cancer in sexual partners , and lowers the risk of urinary tract infections in the first year of life , " the group said			2
@entity66 researchers recently concluded that the rates of @entity51 and other sexually transmitted diseases are likely to climb as @entity2 parents increasingly leave their baby boys uncircumcised			2
" the medical benefits of male circumcision are quite clear , " said dr. @entity71 , an assistant professor of pathology at @entity66 and lead author of the study published in the @entity75			2
" but while the medical evidence has been increasingly more positive , male circumcision rates in the @entity2 have been decreasing			0
" @entity80 : why i chose circumcision for my boys but such benefits may not trump " other considerations for individual families			0
" the study also says the procedure poses rare risks such as " bleeding and swelling			0
" " although the evidence also is clear that infants experience pain , there are several safe and effective ways to reduce the pain			0
if the baby is born prematurely , has an illness at birth , or has congenital abnormalities or blood problems , he should not be circumcised immediately , " the @entity7 said			0
" for example , if a condition called hypospadias is present , in which the infant 's urinary opening has not formed normally , your doctor will probably recommend that your baby boy not be circumcised at birth			0
in fact , circumcision should be performed only on stable , healthy infants			1
" and the procedure , the @entity7 said , " is safest and offers the most health benefits if performed during the newborn period , " it said			1
newborn circumcision " should be performed by trained and competent providers , using sterile techniques and effective pain management , " it said			0
dr. @entity124 , chairwoman of the task force that produced the @entity7 policy statement and technical report , said it 's ultimately up to the parents			1
" parents are entitled to medically accurate and non-biased information about circumcision , and they should weigh this medical information in the context of their own religious , ethical and cultural beliefs , " @entity124 said			2
@entity7 : health benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks she said parents should speak to a doctor about benefits and risks and " discuss who will perform the circumcision			1
" " it 's a good idea to have this conversation during pregnancy , and to learn whether your insurance will cover the procedure , so you have time to make the decision , " @entity124 said			0
the @entity153 has endorsed the policy as well			0
" this information will be helpful for obstetricians who are often the medical providers who counsel parents about circumcision , " said dr. @entity155 , @entity156 , the college 's liaison to the @entity7 task force on circumcision			1
" we support the idea that parents choosing circumcision should have access to the procedure			2
" decline in circumcisions could cost billions			0
