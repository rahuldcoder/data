@entity0 , @entity1 -- somewhere , somehow , someone tried to carry a tribal spear onto a commercial aircraft			1
@entity6 knows that not because he is privy to the nation 's latest intelligence reports but because he works for @entity1 's @entity9 , where objects discovered and surrendered at airport checkpoints are stored , sorted and resold to the public			1
the non-descript government building in @entity0 , @entity1 , could be called the world 's most unusual thrift store because of the odd assortment of stuff that ends up there			1
you 'll find piles of hockey sticks and golf clubs , dozens of snow globes , enough rolling pins to equip a culinary school and so many pocketknives that they are sold by the pound			0
all of the items are prohibited on planes because they could be used as weapons or , in the case of snow globes , could contain liquid explosives			0
every year , passengers surrender about 750,000 prohibited items at airport checkpoints			1
the @entity37 cringes at the term " confiscated " because passengers have the option to return prohibited items to their cars , check them with their baggage , ship them home , or hand them off to someone on the public side of the checkpoint			1
but more often than not , rushed travelers surrender the items -- or " voluntarily abandon " them , in @entity37 parlance -- to screeners			1
@entity37 stands by knife decision illegal items -- guns , grenades , brass knuckles and such -- are handed over to local law enforcement			1
( the @entity37 seizes on average four guns a day at checkpoints and took a total of 1,549 last year			1
) but prohibited items -- knives , large tools and sporting equipment -- are considered excess government property and are sent to the nearest state willing to accept them			2
the @entity37 does not profit from abandoned property , it says			2
but @entity1 says the commonwealth can profit largely because it already has a facility devoted to selling government surplus			2
using those resources , @entity6 said , @entity1 has brought in almost $ 900,000 in the past nine years selling checkpoint items			2
who 's who in opposition to @entity37 rule change knives are probably the most common items aside from liquids , which are thrown away			1
travelers surrender about 35 knives at @entity83 on an average day and about 47 per day at @entity84			0
@entity1 employees research the market values of items and set prices , taking into consideration the items ' conditions			2
some items are sold in a no - frills government surplus store in @entity0			0
most are auctioned on @entity94 ( search for " @entity95 " )			0
new batches of items are placed on the auction block three times a week			0
oddities include a large box filled with bullet belts			0
whether they came from punk rockers or @entity106 fans , or perhaps both , is unknown			0
" you ca n't physically go through each bullet to make sure it 's not a real bullet , " @entity6 said			0
in the inventory this week were @entity113 , or nunchucks , toy guns and a horse whip			1
" i do n't know who would want to take a horse whip onto a plane , " @entity6 said			1
@entity6 said he does n't expect the @entity37 's recent decision to permit small pocketknives to appreciably alter the flow of goods through his department			0
many of the surrendered knives have longer blades and will remain prohibited			0
and there 's always someone trying to board an aircraft with bullet belts , nunchucks and spears , which , if nothing else , keeps jobs at the checkpoint and one @entity1 surplus store very interesting .			0

passengers surrender 750,000 items annually at airport checkpoints , @entity37 says
many items are sold at a @entity1 *warehouse* and *online*
knives are the most common item surrendered ; a horse whip is rather unusual
