three speeches , three days			2
former secretary of state @entity1 is starting to look a lot like someone who is picking up the pace of a presidential campaign -- complete with the perks and the challenges that come with it			1
on wednesday , she spoke to the @entity11			2
thursday , she returned to @entity12 for her place in the lineup of high - profile public figures at a conference the @entity17 was hosting			1
friday night she did @entity19 's " distinguished speakers " series in @entity20			1
asked in @entity22 what her ideal presidential candidate in 2016 would look like , she said : " i 'm not as interested in what the candidate looks like as what the candidate stands for and what the candidate really believes needs to be the agenda for @entity33 's future , particularly as it relates to young people like students at this great university			1
" three big takeaways from @entity1 's return to politics and in what could be interpreted as either a slight dig at president @entity43 -- or at least a way of differentiating herself -- she added , " and what the candidate brings to the table in terms of being able to not only present the agenda but have a very specific set of plans of implanting the agenda and bringing the country along			1
" candidate @entity43 , of course , was viewed by critics as a powerful speaker with less experience and less of a vision to implement , and @entity59 could be playing on buyer 's remorse			1
but the tests she might face on the left and the right were in play this week			2
@entity59 on possible presidency she did n't veer far to the left in her remarks before the wonky liberal crowd at the @entity72 in @entity12 for the @entity17 gathering , but her presence was notable			2
@entity77 contributor @entity75 cautioned that if she faces a challenge in a @entity81 primary , it 's likely to be from the liberal left			2
" it is very hard to imagine somebody beating @entity1 from the center of the party , " he said			1
" if there is going to be anybody who could even give her a tough time , it would be somebody coming from more of a fringe of the party , something kind of a tangent of the party -- either a generational argument or a populist argument			0
" @entity75 specifically mentioned @entity99 sen. @entity98 , who has become a hero to the populist wing of the party , as a potential challenge to @entity59			0
how long can @entity1 wait ? and yet , advantages come for politicians who are considered overwhelming frontrunners like @entity59			1
just this week , liberal billionaire @entity106 said he 's jumping on the bandwagon to draft @entity59 into the 2016 race by becoming a co-chair of the " @entity110 " super @entity112 's finance team			1
even though @entity59 is not exactly lining up donors and bundlers for her own campaign just yet , the commitment to her is a significant one in what could be a quest to sew up her left flank			0
but she 'll have other issues on the right , if she reaches the general election			0
on wednesday , a protestor in @entity22 heckled her over the biggest black mark on her record , the death of four @entity33 at the @entity33 consulate in @entity132 , @entity133 , during her tenure as secretary of state			0
democrats and @entity137 alike say it could be her biggest weakness if she becomes her party 's nominee			0
you let them die , " the protestor said			0
and that weakness leads some to wonder why @entity59 is sticking her neck out so far so soon			0
@entity75 said he 's surprised by how visible and vocal she 's been this fall			0
" i think a lot of people thought that she would basically go under the radar for as long as possible to stay out of the fray , kind of shorten the race , " he said			0
" so it is a somewhat different strategy -- maybe they are trying to sort of avoid the sense that she is kind of an imperial candidate who believes that this is hers by birthright or succession			0
" opinion : @entity1 , do n't run for president			1

@entity1 has made a series of public *appearances* in the past week
moves are *fueling* the speculation of a possible @entity171 bid in 2016
she may also be trying to differentiating herself from president @entity43
