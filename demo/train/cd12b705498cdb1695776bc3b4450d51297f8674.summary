-- a federal judge in @entity2 has dismissed gov. @entity4 's antitrust lawsuit against the @entity5 over its sanctions against @entity7 following the @entity9 child sex abuse scandal			1
@entity11 district judge @entity10 called the lawsuit " a hail mary pass " in her ruling , even as she expressed some sympathy for @entity4 's arguments			1
but in the end , she said , the governor 's complaint does n't meet the legal standards of an antitrust case			1
" the governor 's complaint implicates the extraordinary power of a non-governmental entity to dictate the course of an iconic public institution , and raises serious questions about the indirect economic impact of @entity5 sanctions on innocent parties , " @entity22 wrote			1
" these are important questions deserving of public debate , but they are not antitrust questions			1
" the @entity5 levied unprecedented sanctions against the university last july , fining it $ 60 million and stripping 14 seasons of football victories from late head coach @entity40			1
" these sanctions did not punish @entity9 , " or those who allegedly helped cover up his repeated sexual abuse of disadvantaged children , @entity4 said at the time			2
the @entity5 argued that antitrust cases affect commercial activity , while its athletes are amateurs			1
but @entity22 said the organization 's actions in the @entity9 case go beyond previous actions " related to amateurism and fair play held to be non-commercial			2
" " in another forum , " @entity22 wrote , @entity4 's " appeal to equity and common sense may win the day			0
but in the antitrust world these arguments fail to advance the ball			0
" @entity9 , 68 , was convicted last june on 45 counts of child sex abuse , ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse , which were laid out in graphic testimony by his accusers over the course of the less - than - two - week trial			0
in october , he was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison , meaning he 'll likely die behind bars			0
@entity40 , who coached at @entity7 for 46 years , was fired after @entity9 's arrest in november 2011			2
he had been the all - time leader in major college football victories for a coach , with 409 wins			0
the @entity5 's decision strikes 111 of those from his record , beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumps him from the top of the list			2
a university - funded review of the scandal , led by former fbi director @entity88 , accused former university president @entity89 , @entity40 , suspended athletic director @entity90 and @entity92 president @entity91 of taking part in a cover - up to avoid bad publicity			0
the scandal led to @entity89 's ouster and shocked the nation after @entity88 's team concluded that the school 's top administrators had " empowered " @entity9 , the former defensive coordinator for the football team , to continue his abuse			0
the school 's $ 60 million fine is expected to be paid over five years and will fund an endowment with a mission of fighting child sex abuse and supporting victims .			0

@entity2 's governor sued the @entity5 over its sanctions on @entity7
@entity114 *describes* the lawsuit as a " hail mary pass " and dismisses it
she calls the questions raised " deserving of public debate " but " not antitrust questions "
