-- @entity1 does n't make it easy to like him			1
his smug , smarty - pants shtick seems to be built on the foundation of him being a bit of a pr * * k. and the " @entity10 " and " @entity11 " creator 's one - and - done gig hosting the @entity14 a couple of years backâ € ” where he whipped up a tizzy of faux outrage with his now - infamous '' @entity21 '' numberâ € ” did n't exactly help matters			2
love him or hate him , though ( or simply love to hate him ) , his naughty - boy sagebrush send - up , " @entity24 , " is actually pretty hilarious			2
from his sideline obsession with @entity28 swizzle - stick showmanship to his undeniably clever piggybacking on the small - screen legacy of " @entity31 " and " @entity32 , " @entity25 is clearly a guy who is n't afraid to borrow from his betters			1
and his new film is such an unapologetic homage to 1974 's " @entity37 " that @entity38 probably deserves to get a cut of the box - office receipts			1
still , @entity25 manages to make the film his own , goosing @entity38 ' original formula with hard - r raunchiness and post-modern mischief			1
while @entity25 kept himself off - screen in " @entity11 " ( he merely provided the profane voice of @entity49 's fuzzy pal ) , here he puts himself front and center as @entity51 -- a cowardly and inept sheep farmer in the backwater town of @entity54 , @entity55 , circa 1882			1
at the outset of the film , @entity51 is cowering at ten paces , face - to - face with a grisly gunslinger , nervously trying to weasel his way out of a duel			1
his stammering excuses to back out quickly become a sort of manic stand - up routine that encapsulates the theme of the movie , riffing on all the ways that the @entity70 , contrary to @entity72 legend , is actually a horrible place : the people are stupid yokels , the height of medicine is treating wounds with the pecking beaks of blue jays , and if the @entity78 do n't kill you , the rattlesnakes on the way to the nearest outhouse will			2
he 's like @entity83 in chaps			2
ashamed by @entity51 's lily - livered lack of courage , his schoolmarm girlfriend @entity85 ( @entity86 ) dumps him for @entity89 , the dandy proprietor of the local mustache shop , played with literal whisker - twirling glee by @entity92			2
explaining why he 's more fit to woo her than @entity51 is , he says , '' i can give her wrapped candies			2
'' @entity51 is encouraged to try and win @entity85 back by his sexually frustrated , dim - bulb best friend ( @entity96 ) , whose prostitute girlfriend ( @entity97 with a bottomless grab bag of blow - job one - liners and bodily fluid gags ) withholds sex while doing unprintable acts in her day job			0
but @entity51 is no match for the deep pockets , bad puns , and luxurious waxed handlebar of @entity108 meanwhile , the area 's most wanted desperado , @entity111 ( @entity112 ) is on the run from the law , who while hiding out , sends his sharp - shooting beauty of a wife , @entity117 , ( @entity117 ) into town to lay low			0
which is fine by her			0
she hates the scoundrel and only married him because she was nine at the time and afraid of becoming a spinster			0
needless to say , @entity117 and the harmless , good - hearted @entity51 bond over how dreadful and absurd range life is			0
eventually she hatches a scheme for them to pose as an item to make @entity85 jealous while she teaches him how to shoot a gun and grow a pair			0
@entity25 , who wrote the script with @entity135 and @entity136 , keeps the gags flying like hot lead out of a @entity139			1
and for every three that do n't land , one or two hit the bullseye			0
there are probably a few too many lazy fart and diarrhea jokes for some , but 14 - year - old boys will love it			0
and while the self - satisfied @entity25 may give himself a little too much credit and face time as a leading man ( i could n't help thinking he looks like @entity153 , and his knack for laughing at his own gags is slightly grating ) , @entity147 displays a stunning set of razor - sharp comedic chops that she 's rarely been given the chance to show off			1
it suits her as well as the bustle gown she wears to the local hoedown			0
'' why are the @entity78 so mad ? '' she asks at one point			0
'' we 're basically splitting the country 50/50 with them ! '' i do n't know if " @entity24 " will turn any of the @entity25 haters into fans			1
but for those of us who have remained on the fence until now , his raunchy , rat - a - tat parody is proof that beneath all of the bratty immaturity lays the head and heart of an outrageous quick - draw satirist			0
