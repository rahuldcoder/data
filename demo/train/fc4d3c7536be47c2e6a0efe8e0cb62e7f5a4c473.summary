-- as the developing world becomes more developed , the rise in prosperity in these countries could also result in the rise of a lethal infectious disease -- tuberculosis ( @entity8 )			1
changes in diets and lifestyles are taking place across emerging economies , particularly as more people move to urban settings to earn a living			0
the changes are resulting in higher rates of diseases such as type - 2 diabetes			2
the condition decreases the body 's ability to produce insulin and absorb glucose from the bloodstream and affected 382 million globally in 2013			2
the @entity27 predicts that over 70 % of type - 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with the adoption of healthier lifestyles			2
worryingly , diabetes also triples the risk a person will develop @entity8			1
nine million people developed @entity8 in 2013 and 1.5 million died from the disease , according to the @entity36			1
today , increasing numbers of people affected by diabetes could hamper efforts to control new tb infections			1
concern was raised in a recent report published by the @entity44 and lung diseases and the @entity46 , warning of a burgeoning co-epidemic of the two diseases			0
reduced immunity infection with @entity8 does not always lead to someone developing the disease as the bacteria can hide and lie dormant within the immune system -- known as latent infection			1
on average , people have a 10 % chance of an infection progressing to the active form of the disease			2
but when the integrity of your immune system is compromised , this chance increases			1
" diabetes reduces peoples immunity , " says dr. @entity66 , senior adviser to the @entity44			0
the same biology underlies the interaction between @entity8 and @entity71 , which attacks and destroys your immune system			1
" globally we have about 2 billion people with latent @entity8 , " says @entity66			1
" put diabetes into that equation and you immediately see there is a problem			0
" @entity8 is an airborne disease spread via symptoms such as coughing			1
it has long been a disease associated with poverty , with those affected often residing in the slums and townships of high - burden countries such as @entity89 and @entity90			1
in contrast , diabetes is a condition once linked to the affluent , as diets high in fat and sugar are one of the causes underlying the development of the disease			2
but this is not the case today			0
" eighty percent of people with diabetes live in low and middle - income countries , " states dr. @entity102 , of the @entity46			1
@entity102 is concerned that patients in these countries often remain undiagnosed			0
" the symptoms of both ( tb and diabetes ) can be similar -- loss of weight , tiredness , malaise , " he explains			0
in some regions of the world nearly half of @entity8 patients suffer from diabetes			1
in the state of @entity121 in @entity89 , this was the case for 44 % of patients , according to the report , and affected countries often lack the systems in place to take on diabetes			2
" most countries focus attention on infectious diseases ( like @entity8 ) , " says @entity102			2
unlike @entity8 , there is no cure for diabetes and patients are required to take treatment to maintain their insulin levels			2
the lifestyle changes associated with a rise in type - 2 diabetes among a population are the same changes causing increasing levels of obesity			1
but ironically the two conditions have opposing effects on the likelihood of getting @entity8			0
" obesity reduces the risk of @entity8 , " says @entity102			0
" this creates complications in managing the two afflictions			0
" raising the alarm globally , the rate of new @entity8 infections is falling by just 1.5 % each year and any factors increasing the likely development and spread of the disease could be disastrous , as was the case with @entity8 and @entity160 20 years ago			1
" for years we had medical evidence that the two diseases were working together as @entity71 destroyed people 's immune systems , allowing @entity8 to quadruple in many countries , " says @entity66			1
in 2013 , 1.1 million of the 9 million with @entity8 were also @entity71 positive			2
@entity66 wants to learn from the slow progress and many years it took to mobilize a response to the problem			0
" we want to raise an alarm so that we do n't watch history repeat itself with tb - diabetes , " he adds			0
the number of people with diabetes is predicted to be 592 million by 2035 , with the majority living in countries with high rates of @entity8 , such as @entity89 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184			1
the cost of treating diabetes could be huge in these nations and the unfaltering levels of drug - resistant forms of @entity8 in recent years make any factors influencing the onset of disease a cause for further concern			1
currently , drug - resistant @entity8 takes at least two years to treat			2
one solution is to preempt the problem with early diagnosis			0
" we are doing integrated disease management , " says dr. @entity198 , the minister of health for @entity90 , where one in every 116 people was newly infected with @entity8 in 2013			1
the rates of @entity71 co-infection in @entity90 are among the highest in the world and @entity198 is learning from experience			0
" people must not only test for @entity71 , they must also test for @entity8 , for diabetes , for high blood pressure , " he says			1
this is known as bi-directional screening			0
however getting people to be tested is a further challenge			0
" many went on to test only for @entity71 because it 's the in thing , " explains @entity198			0
" we 'll make sure when you go to a hospital for diabetes , then other ( tests ) are available for you and when you test for @entity8 the other tests are available for you			2
" the goal is to identify people who do n't realize they suffer from more than one of the diseases			0
the main countries being targeted , however , are those in @entity227 , where the co-epidemic is at its peak			0
this screening was pioneered in @entity89 , where over 2 million people had @entity8 in 2013 and projections predict 109 million people will be living with diabetes in 2035			1
" we can pick up people who never knew they had diabetes , " concludes @entity66			0
" that 's a good thing to do			0

nine million people developed @entity8 last year and 1.5 million died of the disease
diabetes *weakens* the immune system , increasing chances of developing @entity8
diabetes is on the rise globally , particularly in low and middle - income countries
almost *600* million people are predicted to have diabetes by 2035
