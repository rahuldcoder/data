-- @entity2 president @entity1 said he will pursue a full @entity4 membership bid during a speech friday that was likely meant to both make the case for membership and manage domestic expectations			1
" we are going to the @entity4 to attain full membership " from the @entity16 , @entity1 told an audience in @entity11 , tempering his rhetoric by adding that " we are not going to bring independence			1
" we will continue to negotiate , " he said			0
@entity1 says he wants the @entity2 territories " to be represented in its natural borders , " calling disputed territories inhabited by @entity23 settlers " illegal			1
" " we want a seat at the @entity4 , and we do n't want anything more , " @entity1 said			2
he says @entity2 leadership does not seek to " isolate the state of @entity23 , but rather isolate the policies of @entity23 , " saying he will head to the @entity4 headquarters in @entity32 " carrying an olive branch with us			1
" @entity23 prime minister @entity33 , who is also expected to speak next friday at the @entity4 , has said the move could complicate the peace process and further destabilize the region			1
" we have been calling all along for the @entity38 to return to negotiations , " said @entity23 government spokesman @entity37			2
@entity37 called the issue of settlements " a red herring " that he says @entity2 leaders have used to avoid talks with @entity23 , deciding to grandstand on the international stage instead of re-engaging in peace negotiations			1
@entity48 , the @entity2 organization that holds sway in @entity49 , also was critical of @entity1 on friday , saying he is showing a willingness to negotiate and acknowledgement of @entity23 , which would " deprive the @entity2 people from their right to come back to their homeland			1
" " we are warning him not to go , " said senior @entity48 official @entity56			0
" this is going to make more division inside the @entity2 people			0
" as regional pressure mounts over the prospective bid next week , @entity60 diplomats have been scrambling to head off the burgeoning controversy , though some analysts suggest the decision to take the vote to the @entity16 could reflect a political posturing by the @entity2 leader			2
@entity1 concluded his speech friday by acknowledging " other options , " presumably referring to his government 's ability to weigh a host of decisions at the @entity75 next week , which may or may not include the full membership bid			2
" as for the other options , we have not taken a decision , " he said			0
while the @entity60 has vowed to veto a full membership application , should it actually come before the @entity16 next friday , the @entity2 government could also go to the @entity75 , where only a majority vote would be needed to gain a lesser status , that of a permanent observer state , similar to the position that the @entity84 currently holds			1
a vote in its favor would be all but assured			0
the @entity38 currently hold the status of a permanent observer entity			0
as an observer , the delegation can speak in the @entity75 but not vote			0
a successful vote in either body will not lead to an established " state " with defined borders , but would afford the @entity2 government an upgraded international status allowing them to pursue legal actions against @entity23			0
@entity1 is expected to personally submit the request for full membership			2
@entity0 's @entity100 contributed to this report .			0
