scary - ass weapons of mass destruction			2
so it baffles us to no end that instead of delving deep into said cornucopia and feasting on the kernels so lavished there when faced with a quandary , folks instead click on over to @entity18 or @entity19 and type missives akin to : " @entity21 , der , der what day is @entity22 this year ? " we understand the urge to crowdsource when , say , you want to decide whether to cut off all your hair / paint your bedroom blue / get a full - body tattoo so as to resemble a @entity28			2
all of those questions are open - ended , subjective and worthy of a response ( such as , " hell no ! go for @entity31 instead ! )			0
but asking the masses something that you could have easily looked up yourself is just plain lazy , especially when said query makes you look like a full - on idiot			0
moreover , your idiocy -- since it has been showcased in a public place -- does not just serve to amuse and horrify your friends			0
no ! with the advent of such tools as @entity42 and resources like @entity44 and @entity45 , your utter mouth - breathing - ness has the ability to get the entire world wondering : how the hell do we continue to exist on this @entity52 when such stunning displays of dullness walk freely among us ? read on for three examples of when people should have just googled it			2
who is @entity59 ? after @entity61 leader @entity59 was killed by @entity63 forces in may 2011 , confused folks started flooding @entity18 and other social sites , posing such queries as : " who is @entity59 and why should i care ? " for some reason , we do n't think 140 characters is going to be enough to suss out that question			1
to their credit , the most perplexed parties ( younger folks who were barely cognizant beings on 9/11 ) took to search engines as well , according to @entity74			0
still , the parade of blithe tweets ( " is he in a band ? " ) are now forever stowed away in the @entity79 like oh - so - embarrassing yearbook pictures -- only much , much worse			0
who is @entity82 ? the music world thrives and subsists on snobbery , you guys			1
the ability to sneer , snort and say , " @entity90 , yeah , you would n't have heard of this band			0
they only have , like , one ep and it 's not even on @entity93			2
" sadly , you all provided this symposium of snobs with even more grist for the you 're - an - idiot mill when , following the @entity82 's @entity97 win last year , you took to the @entity98 to cry : " who is @entity82 ? " or worse yet : " who are the @entity101 ? " there 's now an entire @entity103 -- and t - shirts ! -- documenting your utter lack of musical knowledge			1
a @entity103 and t - shirts , you guys ... we 're not saying you have to listen to @entity82 -- i mean , " @entity111 " was sooooo 2010 , anyway			1
just ... you know ... a little knowledge of their influences , coupled with some light delving into their back catalog would have really lent credence to your assertion that : " @entity121 -- my sweet , sweet love -- was robbed ! @entity124 is the @entity125 ? " what is @entity127 ? last week , @entity128 went dark for one day in protest of @entity130 ( the @entity130 ) and @entity131 ( @entity131 ) , two ( now tabled ) bills in @entity133 designed to stop illegal copying and sharing of intellectual property online			1
sites like @entity128 see such acts as restrictive of online freedom , and in protest , staged mass , one - day blackouts of service			1
@entity128 blacked out everything but the articles on @entity130 and @entity131			1
enter : the enraged masses			0
as documented by the genius @entity18 aggregation account , @ herpderpedia , folks fell to their knees and cried to the heavens ( metaphorically -- we hope ) , bemoaning the loss of that , their own source of news and information ( sarcasm )			0
they beat their chests ( again , we hope metaphorically ) wondering why , oh why " soap " ( " @entity163 is @entity127 ? ! " ) would take away their beloved friend			0
apparently , no one was looking up " sopa " on @entity128			1
or , you know , on @entity0 .			2

after @entity59 was killed , people tweeted , " who is @entity59 ? "
after @entity82 's @entity97 win , people took to the @entity98 to cry : " who is @entity82 ? "
apparently , no one was looking up " sopa " on @entity128 . or , you know , on @entity0
