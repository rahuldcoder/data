-- take one dentist , a catsuit , a horse and a barrel , and you have a world champion			1
four days a week , 25 - year - old @entity7 examines teeth in @entity9 , north of @entity10			1
she spends the rest of her time clad in spandex , performing gymnastics on a horse			1
the @entity19 rider is the favorite for august 's @entity21 , having won world titles in 2010 and 2012			1
" i 've been vaulting since i was eight			1
after that , everything had to fit around it , " she says			2
" i 'm maybe not quite so enthusiastic about being a dentist , but i can earn a living and still get the most out of my vaulting			1
" here are the basics : you get on a moving horse and perform leaps , handstands , tumbles and other acrobatic moves on the animal 's back , while it canters in a circle			1
you can compete as an individual ( where @entity7 excels ) , as a pair ( the " @entity44 " ) or as a team of six			1
men and women of all ages can compete together			2
@entity7 sometimes performs with her 22 - year - old sister @entity49 , who has also represented @entity19			1
" i still get to throw my little sister around , it 's brilliant , " she says			0
even her father , @entity52 , is involved			0
he is @entity7 's " lunger " -- which means his job is to guide the horse from the center of the arena while she competes			1
lunging is an important job : when vaulters win medals , the lunger gets one , too			0
( the horse , meanwhile , must settle for everyone 's lasting gratitude			1
) " the lunger is in constant contact and communication with the horse , " explains @entity66 , a leading vaulting judge			1
" you have to work to keep the horse 's pace and tempo , keep it paying attention to what 's going on			1
" @entity7 says her dad was less than impressed as a spectator at her early domestic competitions			1
" he thought it was so boring , " she recalls			0
" but then i was the reserve for a big international event , and he realized that if you 're at a high level , it 's a brilliant sport			0
" so he looked into getting a horse himself , he got into it , and now he 's a coach and judge as well as my lunger			1
" @entity90 is not the first parent to revise their opinion of vaulting			1
when @entity96 took her eight - year - old girl to pick up hay for their rabbit at a nearby @entity102 farm , she had not planned on raising a vaulting world champion			1
however , there was a demonstration taking place at the farm , and a coach overheard daughter @entity109 's excitement			0
" we knew nothing about it , " recalls @entity110			0
" you ca n't imagine our amazement when we went up to this ranch , and here were these athletes on the backs of horses , doing all sorts of gymnastics and dance moves			1
" i looked at that and thought , no way in hell am i going to let @entity109 do this			0
" five years later , the @entity128 had a horse on each side of the @entity131			1
by the age of 18 , in 2006 , @entity132 had won world gold for the @entity135			0
" i swear i 'm not a bad mom , " adds @entity96 , who claims vaulting is statistically safer than playing on a playground			1
" when @entity109 first wanted to ride a horse , they said she was too young to go into the regular riding program , but they would let her vault -- because an adult controls the horse , and a three - year - old can do it with the horse at walking pace			1
" this is where the barrel comes in			0
if you go straight to the horse with a new move , chances are you will eat sand after a nasty fall moments later			2
a vaulting barrel is the answer			2
" you can build your own , " explains @entity66			0
" it 's basically an oil drum with four steel legs on the bottom -- long and round , with handles on it , and wrapped in padding			0
" you practice new moves on a mat and then go on to the barrel , says former competitor @entity175 , who now manages the @entity19 team at big events			2
" the horses themselves are wrapped up in cotton wool , you train on them just a couple of times a week , " she explains			0
" the rest of the time ? you 'd be on that barrel			0
" new moves , and new links between moves , are the lifeblood of the sport			2
" something the judges have n't seen before , so the sport progresses , " says @entity175			0
for @entity7 , that means the one - handed handstand -- a move many would find tricky on the ground , but which she must pull off while balancing upside - down on a cantering horse			1
" a new move sets you apart from the rest and nobody else had done a one - handed handstand before , " @entity7 says			1
" i tried it in @entity207 last month and it worked			0
now a lot of people know i can do it , so there is more pressure to do it again			0
" flexibility is an obvious asset for a vaulter -- the sport attracts plenty of young gymnasts , though @entity7 insists she had very little bend as a child			1
" i had to be held down and stretched by three other people , which i absolutely hated , " she recalls			0
strength is another vital component , sometimes masked by the necessity for vaulters to compete in all - in - one catsuits			2
" what @entity109 had going for her was her upper - body strength , " @entity96 says of her daughter , who played ice hockey before taking up vaulting			1
" after she had been vaulting for two or three years , we went to watch the @entity235 , and there was a @entity238 recruiting booth which had a pullup contest			2
" @entity109 waited in line , got up there and popped off 25 pullups , aged 10 or 11			2
" all the boys behind her melted out of the line after she finished			0
the recruiter said she could be a marine any time			0
" as a judge , @entity66 looks for exactly the right balance of skills before awarding scores ( from one to a maximum of 10 )			0
" i 'm looking for a vaulter that is smooth , and light , and in harmony with the horse			2
they 're not springing off the horse like it 's a trampoline , they are in motion with the horse as if they are one , " he says			2
" when you leap off the back of a horse , if you are in perfect harmony , you go up as the horse 's stride is going up -- so you leap without jumping			2
" when you land down on the horse , you land in sync with the horse , as softly as a feather on the ground			2
performances will give you goosebumps when that 's the case			0
" so who are the " goosebumps candidates " at the @entity21 ? @entity279 is historically the sport 's leading nation			1
@entity281 and @entity207 are contenders , and the @entity135 has improved dramatically			0
but @entity96 believes @entity7 , the defending individual champion , is still the best			1
" she is the person to beat , " says @entity110 , whose daughter retired from vaulting in 2012			2
" it amazes me that she continued to vault through dental school			0
" @entity175 , who will be @entity7 ' team manager at the @entity21 in @entity287 , adds : " @entity7 is very calm , she can focus completely on what she has to do			1
" between her and her dad , they 've taken every single part of the sport and worked out what you need to achieve			0
" @entity7 herself is , for now , secretly watching vaulting clips over lunch with her dental nurse at the surgery			1
however , she has two tournament wins to her name in the past month and feels ready to return to the spotlight			0
" when i started , we were just having a laugh , " she says			0
" we were lucky to do so well			0
" now , it feels like we 're riding on the back of success			0
it gets better and better			0
