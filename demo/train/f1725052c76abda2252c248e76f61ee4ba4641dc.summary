-- you 've probably seen it hundreds of times over this long holiday weekend : you 're driving down the highway or along a hometown street , and from the car in front of you someone heaves a pile of garbage out the window			1
maybe it 's the driver of the car , balling up fast - food wrappers and paper bags and tossing them high into the air as his car speeds merrily along			0
or maybe it 's someone on the passenger side , opening the window and lofting a soft - drink can or glass bottle somewhere in the direction of the side of the road , barely missing your hood			2
it 's like an aerial barrage , everywhere around you , all the trash being thrown from all the cars onto all the roadways			0
... what ? you say you did n't see anything like that ? you say you did n't observe a single person throw a single load of garbage from a car window ? right			1
chances are , the scenario described above seems like a bad dream , something you did n't witness and would not want to			2
and therein lies a tale			0
there was a time in the @entity48 when those piggish actions -- using highways and local roads as garbage dumps , reflexively throwing trash from car windows without considering there was anything wrong -- was quite commonplace			1
people did it because -- well , they did it because so many other people were doing it			2
why did things change ? lost in all the recent coverage of the 50th anniversary of the death of president @entity66 , and its ramifications for @entity48 history , was a sidelight that , in retrospect , had a fairly remarkable effect on the way we live			0
when @entity75 and his wife , @entity76 , moved into the @entity77 at the end of 1963 , they faced an almost impossible task			1
the nation was in mourning for the glamorous young president ; suddenly @entity66 and his elegant wife , @entity82 , were no longer living at @entity83 , and it was going to be tough for anyone to measure up			0
@entity75 , a rough - hewn type from @entity86 , struck the country as the antithesis of @entity66 in terms of style and personal smoothness , and @entity76 knew that neither she , nor anyone else , could replace @entity93 in the nation 's affections			1
but what @entity76 -- born @entity76 in rural eastern @entity86 in 1912 -- managed to do during her years as first lady has had admirable consequences that are felt even today			1
and one of those consequences was the garbage you did n't see being thrown out of car windows this holiday weekend , and the piles of trash you do n't see building up by the sides of roads and highways every day of the year			1
mrs. @entity76 decided that she would use her position as the president 's wife to push hard for improvements in what she thought was an area ignored in the public consciousness : highway beautification			1
not that she especially liked that word " beautification			2
" she thought that it made her projects seem a little trivial			1
yet she firmly believed , as she once said , that " ugliness is so grim			0
a little beauty , something that is lovely , i think , can help create harmony , which will lessen tensions			0
" much of her efforts centered on planting wildflowers along highways , and limiting roadside junkyards and garish billboards			0
she persuaded her husband to advocate legislative policies on behalf of her projects , and if there was one thing @entity75 knew how to do , it was get his way with legislation			0
the @entity135 , passed in 1965 , was sometimes referred to as " @entity76 's bill			1
" a lasting benefit of her endeavors was @entity48 ' realization that casually littering roadsides with garbage and refuse from cars was just not acceptable			1
the @entity135 did not outlaw littering on a federal level , but the impulse behind the legislation led to nationwide discussions about how to combat litter			1
" beauty belongs to all the people , " president @entity75 said at the signing ceremony , " and so long as i am president , what has been divinely given to nature will not be taken recklessly away by man			2
" there had been " do n't - be - a - litterbug " initiatives before @entity76 moved into the @entity77 , but having her as the voice of highway beautification , and having her regularly proclaim her support for the anti-littering efforts , made people pay attention			1
more than one child of the era , riding in a parent 's station wagon , was -- in whimsical tones but with serious intent -- admonished , when he or she tossed wrappers out the window : " @entity76 would n't like that			1
" and more than one parent heard the same thing from his or her child , when the parent was the garbage - tossing offender			2
what is impressive is how dramatically habits have changed			0
certainly there still is highway litter ; adopt - a - highway and sponsor - a - highway programs have become well known ways to combat it , as have hefty fines			0
ours is not exactly a polite , filled - with - constant - consideration - for - others society			0
yet the kind of highway slobbishness that once was an unavoidable part of daily life -- the what 's - the - big - deal hurling of trash from moving cars -- today carries a stigma that previously was lacking			1
seeing a person throwing garbage from car windows now is kind of like seeing a person pulling out a cigarette on an airplane			0
it just comes across as immediately wrong			0
although you do n't hear her name much these days , she really did make a difference in the way her fellow @entity48 live			2
and she did it by opening people 's eyes to what they should have been seeing all along			0
( now , if some future first lady -- or first husband -- would only devote herself or himself to the issue of people texting and talking on phones as they drive			0
... ) the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			2

@entity217 : there was a time when drivers threw garbage out the window without a thought
that *rarely* happens now . thank @entity76 , who made highway beautification a cause
he says @entity76 pushed @entity135 ; helped make people more aware of littering
@entity217 : @entity76 is *unsung* , but she helped stop *behaviors* that we would n't tolerate today
