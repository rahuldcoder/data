-- @entity1 crashed to an early upset defeat at @entity3 for the second year in a row as the fifth seed was sent packing in straight sets monday by @entity8 @entity7 in their first round match			1
looking a shadow of the player who claimed a record eighth @entity14 title earlier this month , the @entity10 succumbed meekly 7 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 4 in a shade short of three hours on @entity16			0
last year he was beaten in the second round by @entity19 @entity18 , the prelude to a lengthy injury layoff which saw him miss the @entity22 and the next two grand slams			2
@entity1 only returned to the @entity25 circuit in february and has been in imperious form , winning seven titles , including the @entity14			2
with the exception of a hard court tournament in the @entity32 , only one of the events has been on a surface other than his favored clay			0
but coming into @entity3 and despite his lack of preparation on grass , @entity1 was rated among the favorites despite his lowly seeding			1
however , he has fallen at the first hurdle , beaten by the 29 - year - old @entity7 , who was securing the most notable victory of his career			1
throughout the match , @entity1 , who has a history of knee problems , appeared to be nursing an injury and looked slow and sluggish			1
after claiming the first two sets on tiebreaks , the second time after coming back from a break down to @entity1 , @entity7 made an early breakthrough to lead 2 - 0 in the third set			1
@entity1 could make little impression on his service and @entity7 duly served out for the match , clinching it with his 13th ace			1
" nobody was expecting my win today			0
i do n't know what to say			0
i 'm really happy , " @entity7 said after his unlikely triumph			2
" ok , @entity1 did n't play his best tennis , but i knew the first match on grass is always difficult			1
for me it is a big win			0
" he lost early last year as well , but if you try to focus on him it is tougher			0
i try to focus on myself and i think i did great today			0
" journeyman @entity7 , who has been campaigning for most of 2013 on the second tier @entity68 , had only previously reached the second round at @entity3 in 2009			1
" i always played good on grass , maybe not here because i had tough draws , but i have two wins against top 10 players on grass , " he added			0
@entity1 refused to use any possible injury as an excuse for his defeat , the first time he had lost in the opening round of a grand slam			1
" it 's not the right day ( to talk about his knees ) i tried my best in every moment , but it was not possible this afternoon , " said @entity1			2
" on grass , it 's difficult to adapt when you do n't have a chance to play on the surface before @entity3			2
@entity7 deserved to win today			2
" earlier , @entity1 's arch rival @entity91 breezed through the opening match of his bid for a record eighth @entity3 crown -- then spared a thought for the " influential and amazing " @entity96 , who is in critical condition in a @entity99 hospital			1
the defending champion dropped just five games in beating @entity102 of @entity103 , finishing by taking the final set to love			1
" there was just a bit of a breeze and it was cold			0
i 'm happy to get out of there early and quickly			0
so it was a perfect day , " was the @entity113 maestro 's initial verdict on a peerless performance in his opener			0
when asked about former @entity117 president @entity96 , @entity91 said he hoped the 94 - year - old would make a recovery			1
" he 's been very influential , an amazing personality , you know , believed in something , had to pay a big price for it , " he added			0
" someone you can definitely look up to and that 's very important for me			0
clearly there 's many that come and go , but he has been there for a very long time and he 's very much respected and loved			0
" in a 2011 global study of more than 50,000 people in 25 countries , @entity91 had been ranked second only to @entity96 as a respected , admired and trusted personality			1
his mother @entity138 also hails from @entity117 and he is a regular visitor to the country for charitable activities			0
home hope @entity141 also had an easy passage into the second round , easing past @entity145 of @entity146 in straight sets , 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 2			1
in the final match of the day , @entity148 of @entity149 rolled back the years to knock out 11th seed @entity151 of @entity113			2
the champion 11 years ago beat the dangerous @entity151 6 - 4 7 - 5 6 - 3 , showing a return to his best form after being dogged by injuries in recent years .			2
