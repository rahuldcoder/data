-- as the days drag on , tempers understandably begin to fray			0
for the relatives of those lost on @entity6 , frustrations mounted as criticism of the airline 's handling of the crisis piles up			1
those who have congregated in the @entity12 in @entity13 , wearily trudging back time and again to official airline briefings where news trickles out , if at all , feel that not enough is being done to support relatives			1
on thursday , news that might be the break that the families are waiting for was broadcast from the @entity20 search zone			2
as @entity24 prime minister @entity23 briefed the @entity24 parliament that " new and credible " information had come to light that objects possibly from @entity6 may have been spotted by satellites , relatives waiting in the @entity12 hotel filed into a conference room where a large tv was showing @entity32 news			1
the mood was tense as they watched @entity23 report the new findings , giving hope that the wait for definitive news might soon be over			2
an audible , heavy sigh punctuated the attentive atmosphere , giving voice to the frustrations that the families are enduring			0
frustration of relatives boils over health concerns a day earlier , tensions had been rising at the hotel in a room where briefings to update the relatives were held			1
stress , a lack of sleep and -- in some cases -- old age are conspiring against those camped out in @entity13 hotels , and health levels are wearing as thin as tempers			1
several family members @entity0 talked to said they can not sleep due to the anxious wait , and are getting sick			1
they bemoan the limited medical support that the airline is offering			0
" do you know how many family members got sick already here while waiting for the updates on the plane ? " a relative asked angrily at wednesday 's briefing			1
" how exactly are you going to take care of these sick people ? " a @entity75 representative conceded that out of the 465 registered family members in @entity13 , there are a number of cases of families reporting ill - health			1
families from across @entity32 have come to the capital to be close at hand for any news of their loved ones , but have been placed in hotels far from the city center			1
an elderly man said at the briefing that he does n't know where to find hospitals from his hotel and he feels dizzy			0
beleaguered airline reps have pledged to make an effort to improve the situation			0
" we might have flaws in our action here ( accommodating the families ) , but our intention is definitely to take good care of them , " a manager of @entity75 's @entity98 told the briefing			2
hotel a grim backdrop as relatives cling to hope lack of @entity113 government engagement the victims ' families also feel that they are not being given due attention by the @entity113 government			1
" why there are still no @entity113 government representatives willing to meet with us family members ? why ? " another man at a briefing wednesday asked			1
" does the @entity113 ambassador really care about the feelings of the family members here ? we are very disappointed			1
" deeply disappointed by the lack of support and information , and frustrated by a lack of @entity113 government presence in @entity13 , some family members are setting up a " @entity138 , " and are inviting each family to bring one representative forward and will then vote on what to do next			1
when @entity113 officials finally arrived friday morning , they greeted the families with a presentation on the flight route			0
around 400 to 500 relatives attended , but this contact comes a full two weeks after plane went missing			1
perhaps surprisingly , the assembled relatives listened to the already - known news calmly and quietly			2
legal uncertainty the limbo the families find themselves in is creating uncertainty about their rights and eligibility for compensation , with relatives taking the desperate step of asking the airline for advice on their legal standing			1
" right now , there are just two options , one is the passengers are alive , the other is that they are dead , " one woman said at a briefing tuesday			0
" as an airline , you need to explain to all of us here what rules and conditions apply in either of these cases for us family members here , and what rights do we have in either cases			1
you have the responsibility to inform us that			0
" a " special consolation payment " of 31,000 yuan -- around $ 5,000 -- has been paid out to relatives of passengers and crew , @entity32 's official state media reported			2
the airline 's ceo said sunday that only " immediate financial assistance " was so far being given to the families			2
lawyers say that this payment will not affect future claims for compensation			2
" the $ 5,000 comfort money ... was made according to @entity195 and @entity196 relating to @entity197 , and should not be considered as part of the compensation , " @entity192 , a legal expert specializing in aviation , told @entity0			2
" we reserve our legal rights to sue , " one relative told @entity0			1
" what they 've done so far is so unpopular			0
at least no one in @entity32 is saying anything good about them			0
we have to definitely practice our own rights			0
" in any case , the unknown status of the aircraft and its passengers mean that it would be difficult , if not impossible , to claim compensation at this moment			0
" it is not the right time to sue for compensation , because @entity75 has not come to conclusion that the airline was crashed or all passengers died			0
so it is impossible to file the case in court in @entity32 , " @entity222 , a human rights lawyer , said			0
a prominent @entity227 aviation lawyer , @entity226 , told @entity24 media that the airline could face damage claims of " half a billion dollars , or more			0
" keeping faith despite the increasing likelihood that the wait is in vain , it 's hard for these families , brought together through tragedy , to let go			0
there 's a message board and a heart - shaped candlelight vigil set up inside the hotel 's conference hall , where daily family briefings are held			2
