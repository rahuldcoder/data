-- @entity1 had more reason than most to dream the @entity4 moon landings would rapidly expand space travel			1
his father was a @entity7 astronaut , as were many of his neighbors near @entity11 ' @entity10			0
this is a rendering of @entity14 's @entity13 , which would be used to send people on suborbital spaceflights			1
with nearly all of humanity still on @entity19 nearly four decades later , the computer game developer paid $ 35 million for a ride aboard a @entity22 soyuz spacecraft to the international space station			1
" flight to space is an entire series of pinnacle life experiences , " said @entity1 , a 48 - year - old board member of @entity24 , the company that arranged his 12 - day trip last year			1
" the view of the @entity19 is life changing			0
" @entity1 believes the @entity32 has n't fulfilled the promise of the @entity4 yet			0
" it was an assumed future that we 'd all go to space [ by now ] , " he said			1
" that has n't come to pass , and it 's created this interesting evolution of spaceflight right now			2
" that evolution involves the privatization of space , and although the prospect of a spacecraft in every garage is n't near , a few private firms are getting close to manned , commercial spaceflight			1
some companies , such as @entity50 , aim to sell suborbital flights -- high enough to reach the edges of space and weightlessness -- within the next few years			1
the flights have varied purposes , including tourism and science experiments			1
a @entity60 company hopes to sell habitable space stations where paying clients would conduct scientific research			1
two relatively new @entity32 aerospace companies were hired last year by @entity7 to send unmanned cargo to the international space station			1
@entity7 plans to retire the space shuttle at the end of 2010 and would n't be able to send crews to the space station for at least several years after that			2
" i really view us and the private sector as the spiritual inheritors of @entity4 , " said @entity72 , director of the @entity74 office of @entity75 , the company developing the commercial space stations			1
suborbital flights : thrills and experiments now , orbit later one group preparing to sell suborbital flights is @entity50 , whose parent company is partnering with @entity89 - based @entity88 to develop @entity90 , the successor to 2004 's @entity93 - winning @entity92			1
space tourists will pay @entity50 $ 200,000 each for training and a 2.5 - hour flight to the edge of space and back			2
about 300 people have paid at least the majority of the fee to reserve the first flights , and about 80,000 others have registered interest , said @entity106 , @entity50 's commercial director			1
the spaceship , which will carry six passengers and be based in @entity109 , will be hoisted by a carrier craft to 50,000 feet before blasting on its own to suborbit , where passengers will float weightless about the cabin and see space and the @entity19 through large windows			2
the craft will land on a runway and be reused			0
the carrier craft is being flight tested , and @entity90 's flight tests are expected to begin at the end of this year , @entity106 said			0
with 20 to 30 test spaceflights expected , it could be 18 months to two years before it 's ready commercially , he said			0
tourism is n't the only planned use			0
the craft could be modified to launch microsatellites , and @entity50 hopes to sell flights to agencies for microgravity or atmospheric experiments			1
" to be able to have something like @entity133 to put scientists in space ... at a relatively low cost , it 's transforming for science , " @entity106 said			1
@entity89 's @entity14 also is developing a reusable vehicle that will take a pilot and a front - seat customer to the edge of space -- for pleasure or to transport scientific payloads that would benefit from microgravity			1
@entity14 's @entity13 , roughly the size of a small airplane , will take off and land on a runway and propel itself with liquid - fuel engines			0
sales agent @entity151 is selling one - hour @entity13 rides plus training for $ 95,000 a person			0
initially launching from @entity156 , @entity89 , participants will get a view from the edge of space for several minutes and briefly experience weightlessness			2
test flights may begin by the end of 2010 , and testing would take at least a year , ceo @entity160 said			2
a second , expendable stage may be added to launch nanosatellites , he said			0
like other suborbital providers , @entity14 eventually wants to develop an orbital vehicle			1
the @entity13 is a technical pathfinder to that -- something that could make money and prove the reliability and safety of the technology			0
" there 's a market for people in orbit if the price is low enough , " @entity160 said			0
" there 's more work to do [ in orbit ] , including people flying to be a laborer to work on somebody 's widget or experiment			0
" ireport.com : where were you during the moon landing ? commercial , habitable space stations getting people to orbit is exactly what @entity75 needs to sell its space stations			1
@entity196 is developing expandable space habitats with a flexible - fabric shell			1
they would be compressed in a capsule for launch and expand upon deployment			0
@entity196 primarily sees the habitats as destinations for research scientists and astronauts -- particularly those from countries that have n't used the international space station as much as they 'd like or nations making their first steps into space , @entity203 said			2
the space station 's own future is in doubt , with a @entity7 space station program manager recently telling a public hearing that @entity7 currently plans to de-orbit the station in 2016 , according to the @entity221			2
affordable microgravity research can help manufacturers make new material for things such as supercomputers and buildings , @entity203 said			0
@entity196 -- founded and financed by hotel chain owner @entity196 -- put two subscale , uninhabited models in orbit in 2006 and 2007 through a @entity22 / @entity232 launch provider			0
it eventually aims to develop a full habitat that can support up to eight people			0
but it wo n't launch the habitat without a way to transport people there			0
@entity203 , @entity1 and others in the private sector say they hope @entity7 can be persuaded to invest in , and eventually hire , aerospace companies to deliver @entity7 astronauts to low - @entity19 orbit instead of using its own spacecraft			1
in such a scenario , the companies would also get to sell their shuttle services to other private - sector customers			1
that would increase launch rates and lower costs for @entity7 and the private sector , they said			2
@entity7 did not respond to a request for comment			0
putting people into orbit one company that may wish to help is @entity261 ( @entity261 ) , one of two firms @entity7 hired to send unmanned cargo to the international space station after the shuttle 's planned retirement			1
@entity261 , founded and financed by @entity269 founder @entity268 , received money from @entity7 to develop its spacecraft			0
last year , the @entity89 company was awarded a @entity7 contract for 12 supply flights from roughly 2011 to 2015			2
@entity261 will use its @entity276 rocket topped by its @entity277 , which would carry the cargo			0
the rocket 's first test flight should be later this year , said @entity281 , @entity261 's vice president for strategic relations			0
three demonstration flights with the @entity277 would follow , starting perhaps in early 2010 , with the @entity277 docking with the space station on the third trip			1
@entity7 does have an option to fund a version of the dragon that can transport astronauts , and @entity261 is eager to do that			0
however , @entity7 has n't executed the option , @entity281 said			0
with the global economic downturn , one might think developing space products and finding customers would be difficult			1
but people in the industry -- especially those working for companies founded by businessmen with large fortunes -- say they 'll be fine in the long term			2
" our industry is still hiring engineers , whereas most industries are laying people off , " said @entity301 , executive director of the industry group @entity302			0
" the investors putting money behind these ventures are personally committed			2

private firms are getting close to manned , commercial spaceflight
companies are preparing to sell suborbital flights for pleasure , science
firms see suborbital flights as a stepping stone to orbital ventures
