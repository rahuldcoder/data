-- @entity2 pace bowling legend @entity1 has launched a passionate defence of @entity4 , claiming that the 20/20 version of the game is threatening to completely destroy the five - day format			1
speaking exclusively to @entity0 , @entity1 -- who has just released his autobiography " @entity9 " -- admitted he disliked the limited - overs game so much that he turned down television work on the recent world 20/20 championship in his native @entity2			1
" i am not interested in 20/20 at all			0
maybe i am an old fogey but i think it is destroying test cricket , " said @entity1			1
blog : 20/20 broadening cricket 's appeal " kids should be playing test cricket and then maybe progressing to 20/20 once established			1
but now , with all the money available in 20/20 , top young players are not going to be interested in playing the five - day game			2
" when you can earn $ 800,000 for playing six weeks in the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , why waste six years trying to earn that sort of money in test cricket ? " if this is n't controlled properly , test cricket will die			2
when i was playing , people said : ' test cricket is too slow , ' so they brought in 50 - over one - day cricket			2
now it 's down to 20 - overs			0
what happens next ? 15 overs ? 10 overs ?			0
@entity1 also believes that test cricket is not being helped by the way the sport 's governing body , the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) is managing the game			1
" the @entity41 needs to see how football 's governing body @entity44 runs things			2
the @entity41 are letting the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) dictate how cricket is run and that is all wrong			1
@entity51 is where the money is in cricket at the moment but that does n't mean they should have a say in how cricket is governed			0
" @entity44 would n't let @entity58 dictate how to run football and cricket should n't let @entity51 have more of a say just because they have money there			0
" basically , the @entity41 are governing cricket so badly that soon nobody will pay any attention to them at all			1
if test cricket is boring it is because the @entity41 are handling the calendar all wrong			1
" @entity67 are playing a series in @entity69 soon , but who cares ?			0
imagine there was a two - division system , six teams in each , with promotion and relegation			0
@entity51 to face @entity76 with the losers being relegated to @entity78 -- now that would be a @entity4 series to watch ! " holding also told @entity0 that he would suspend any player found to have been betting on matches , although would stop short of banning them for life			1
" no cricketer , in fact no sportsman , should be betting on matches -- to win or lose			0
if there is irrefutable evidence that a player has been caught betting on matches , they have to be banned			0
" however , not for life , i believe in people getting second chances , but if it happened twice -- then ban them for life			0
