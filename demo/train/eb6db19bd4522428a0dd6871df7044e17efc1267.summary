it was a package tour through @entity52 that gave me my love of travel and made me comfortable traveling alone			1

on a tour in @entity102 , our @entity104 guide / driver suddenly braked , ran out of the car and called us over to look at a trail of ants that locals use for cold medicine			0

he had his hand in his pocket just as i came up to him			0
i 'm sure he has n't made that mistake again			0

tours ease fears traveling alone can be a scary proposition , particularly when you have n't done it before or do n't speak a local language			2

tours are floaties for world travelers -- they allow you to dip your toes in the pool without the fear of getting in over your head			1

one diehard independent traveler i know wanted to visit the wild but scattered @entity210			1
lack of infrastructure and traditional tourist services meant going to all the obscure places he wanted to see -- including some historic @entity217 battlefields -- would have cost upward of $ 10,000 for charters and services			0
instead , he spent $ 3,500 on a package tour , enjoyed every minute of it and remains in touch with several members of the tour , including a still - active @entity217 vet			2
what 's more , saving on the cost of excursions means you 'll have more money to splurge on a memorable dinner with your new friends or a ridiculous souvenir for your family			0
