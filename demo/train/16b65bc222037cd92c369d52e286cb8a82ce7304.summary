@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 children are n't necessarily getting smarter or dumber , but that might not be good enough to compete globally , according to numbers cited tuesday by secretary of education @entity7			1
the @entity9 found @entity4 students placed below average in math and science			1
he noted a special analysis put out last week by the @entity9 that compares 15 - year - old @entity4 students with students from other countries in the @entity19			1
it found the @entity4 students placed below average in math and science			1
in math , @entity4 high schoolers were in the bottom quarter of the countries that participated , trailing countries including @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
according to the report , the @entity4 math scores were not measurably different in 2006 from the previous scores in 2003			1
but while other countries have improved , the @entity4 has remained stagnant			1
in science , the @entity4 falls behind countries such as @entity36 , @entity37 and the @entity38			1
@entity7 told a room full of science and math experts of the @entity42 on tuesday morning that this will hurt the @entity4 as it competes internationally			2
" we are lagging the rest of the world , and we are lagging it in pretty substantial ways , " he said			1
" i think we have become complacent			2
we 've sort of lost our way			0
" he acknowledged that in some areas of the @entity4 it is hard to find good math and science teachers			2
to solve that problem , he said , " i think we should pay math and science teachers a lot more money			2
we pay everybody the same			0
we have areas of critical need -- math , science , foreign language , special education in some places			2
i think we need to pay a premium for that			0
" the @entity68 , which represents teachers , argues against such a proposal			0
" simply being a teacher of a hard - to - staff subject does not equate with effective instruction , and therefore , should not be rewarded in - and - of - itself through a salary differential , " the organization says in a position statement			0
the fourth - and eighth - graders who were part of the mathematics testing have improved their average scores compared with their @entity83 counterparts , but they still lag behind their @entity85 peers in @entity28 , @entity86 , @entity37 , @entity87 and @entity88			0
in science , fourth - graders have fallen behind other students even though their average scores remained about the same			0
the eighth - graders ' scores remain about the same compared to 1995			0
" it has huge implications , " @entity7 said			0
" i think as a real economic imperative we have to educate our way to a better economy			0
