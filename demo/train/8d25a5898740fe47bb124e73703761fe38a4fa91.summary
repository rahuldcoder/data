-- churches in the @entity3 states of @entity4 and @entity5 on the island of @entity7 have vowed to continue to use the word " @entity9 " in defiance of a @entity3 court ruling this week that ruled that the word could not be used by a @entity15 newspaper to refer to the @entity16			1
@entity17 in @entity3 use the term interchangeably to refer to the @entity17 and muslim @entity16 , but now a @entity17 newspaper published in the capital @entity22 has been told to stop doing so			1
the archbishop of the @entity24 in @entity26 datuk @entity25 described the decision as " excessive , utterly irresponsible and grossly demeaning , to say the least			0
" in the meantime , @entity17 in @entity4 and @entity5 continue to reverently worship their @entity9 until the @entity31 comes , " rev. @entity25 said in a statement reported in @entity3 media			1
" what are you going to do about it ? " he said in an earlier statement the decision struck at the constitutional basis of the @entity3			2
the @entity3 constitution guarantees freedom of religion while making @entity42 the state religion			2
" we find it completely unacceptable that what are common practices of the @entity48 and @entity5 for hundreds of years , and indeed for generations of @entity17 even before the very idea of @entity3 was conceived , are now proscribed by administrative orders and laws , " rev. @entity25 said			1
president of the @entity54 , datuk @entity55 , said churches in the state would continue to use the word " @entity9 " in their church services , publications and prayers			1
" we have made a very clear stand and we will stick to it , " he said			0
" we have purged our hearts and minds on whatever decision the court would make			0
even if the court decides against us using the word , we will continue to use it			1
" the unanimous decision by three @entity19 judges sitting in @entity3 's appeals court on monday overturns a 2009 decision from a lower court that permitted @entity76 to use the word @entity9			1
" the usage of the word @entity9 is not an integral part of the faith in @entity82 , " chief judge @entity77 said in the court ruling			1
" the usage of the world will cause confusion in the community			0
" the @entity76 editor rev. @entity87 said he was " disappointed and dismayed , " and would appeal against the decision			0
" it is a retrograde step in the development of law in relation to the fundamental liberty of religious minorities , " he said			0
the decision comes amid escalating ethnic and religious tension in @entity3 following a bruising election campaign in may in which the ruling coalition -- which has been in power since federation in 1963 -- found its support among urban voters crumbling			2
prime minister @entity103 has attempted to shore up his support among majority ethnic @entity105 , by toughening security laws and boosting @entity3 's controversial policy of bumiputra -- a @entity111 term that literally means " son of the soil " -- which favors the ethnic @entity111 majority , providing them with preference in employment , business , education and housing			2
while proponents say the radical affirmative action campaign -- instituted in the early 1970s in response to anti-chinese riots in @entity3 in 1969 -- has lifted many urban malays into the middle class , critics say that @entity128 , @entity129 and the indigenous @entity130 have been excluded from the political process			0
while problems with bumiputra were among the election issues in may , allegations of government cronyism and nepotism are now high on the list of voter concerns			0
@entity103 's latest steps to reverse liberal reforms -- known as " reformasi " -- has hit educated young @entity3 in their 20s and 30s who have been leaving the country to take up opportunities overseas			0
the brain drain is now a serious problem for the coalition government which has embarked on economic reforms , but is accused of doing little to reform the public service or education			0
according to @entity3 's @entity153 from 2010 , 61.3 % of @entity105 practice @entity42 , while 9.2 % are @entity17 .			1
