-- i grew up on the border , at the site of today 's humanitarian crisis involving tens of thousands of immigrant children seeking asylum			1
even though i was born in @entity8 ' @entity7 , my family and i lived on the @entity11 side of the river for seven years of my childhood			2
there i saw poverty firsthand , right around the corner from our house , in the streets , by the bridge , in the countryside			2
it looked like hungry children in dirty diapers living in dirt floor huts with no shoes , no clothes , no running water , no education , no health care and often no idea from where the next meal would come			1
it was the stench of running sewage , of dirty laundry , of mangy dogs , of rotting food			2
and later , as the drug trade and related violence increased , it was n't just poverty that hung in the air , it became fear			2
i narrowly dodged being at a restaurant one evening in @entity46 , @entity11 , when a gunbattle broke out			0
my best friend hit the floor so hard he woke up with bruises all over his knees and elbows , blood splattered on his sneakers			0
another night , walking near my grandparents ' home , i bumped into a man bathed in blood			0
he 'd just been shot and was running for his life			0
the area was the site of the infamous @entity62 killings			0
and that was more than 20 years ago			1
it 's only gotten worse , not just on the border but throughout @entity11 and @entity67 , which is why our nation must shift its foreign policy priorities closer to home			1
fortunately , for me , i was born into a middle - class family			0
our life was filled with tensions most @entity76 know too well : saving our home from foreclosure , keeping the lights on and worrying whether my dad 's small business would survive tough times			1
but -- unlike the children flooding into our country -- we felt safe from hunger , from violence , from fear of losing our lives at any moment			1
like most @entity76 , we found comfort and complacency in that degree of safety			1
and so like most @entity76 , we did not question the priority our nation continuously placed on the @entity95			1
september 11 , 2001 , only fueled that focus because we felt the impact of terrorism bred in the @entity95 on our own soil			2
but should n't today 's humanitarian crisis along the border be a wake - up call to the fact that we must finally place a higher priority on @entity105 ? the results of the unbridled violence and poverty south of our border have long spilled onto our soil			1
and , after the failure of governments throughout the hemisphere to turn the tide , the effects are evident in this flood of desperate humanity seeking refuge and opportunity			0
as someone who grew up there , i can assure you that more border security is not the answer			2
this solution -- often prioritized by political leaders and epitomized by @entity8 gov. @entity129 's decision to deploy the @entity130 -- is nothing but macho swagger that oversimplifies the problem and will only succeed in turning our border region into more of a war zone			2
we must remember that places such as the @entity7 are still a part of @entity67			0
the beleaguered people who live there have a right to enjoy the same freedom and safety the rest of @entity67 holds dear			0
and no matter how much border security exists , it will not stop this deluge of humanity , but it will tell our children and those watching around the world that @entity67 is a heartless nation			1
if the @entity153 is the symbol of immigrant @entity67 from another era , what statue should be erected in the @entity7 ? a solider pointing a weapon southward through a towering barbed wire fence ? is that the new image we wish to form of @entity67 for generations to come ? to the contrary , we must stop dealing only with symptoms and tackle the real problems			0
the constant tide of northward migration from @entity105 is a symptom of deeper problems , as is our nation 's paralysis in dealing with all of the undocumented immigrants who have already crossed our borders			1
our foreign policy priorities must shift , and we must invest more talent and resources in collaborating with @entity105 governments to fix their broken countries , economies and societies			1
president @entity181 's meeting with @entity67 leaders this week must be the beginning of a deeper commitment to solving our shared challenges			0
a quick glance at the @entity188 's list of the top 20 nations benefiting from @entity105 foreign aid includes only one @entity105 nation , @entity192 coming at 15th			1
four out of the top seven recipient nations are in the @entity95			1
absent from the list of the top 20 are any of the nations most directly involved in this recent wave of immigrants : @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity11			1
while the crises in @entity204 and @entity205 are reminders that we can not ignore the rest of the world , it is also clear we must do more in our own backyard so that so many of our neighbors do n't feel compelled to flee their homes			0
the problem begins , and must be resolved , in these immigrants ' nations of origin			2
but we must also deal with the situation we have at home			0
not only should we be humane and generous in caring for these young immigrants ; we must include them within our approach to comprehensive immigration reform			0
and we must act now			0
we must embrace a more inclusive vision of the @entity223 as our larger shared home because we are so highly interdependent , as evidenced by this mounting crisis			1
and we must make this hemispheric home a better place to live for all , everywhere , so that people are more likely to build their lives closer to where they were born , nearer to their families and connected to their cultures			0
if they had that chance , i 'm sure they 'd take it			0
and we 'd all be better off as @entity76 , and @entity239			1
join us on @entity241 / @entity240 .			0

@entity243 : border crisis shows *urgent* need for @entity76 to focus more on the @entity223
children need humanitarian aid , and their nations need more @entity76 aid , he says
we must invest more resources in helping @entity105 fix broken nations , he says
@entity243 : only one @entity105 nation is among the top 20 recipients of @entity76 aid
