few ancient civilizations have left an architectural footprint quite as indelible as the @entity2 did in @entity3 , southern @entity4			1
majestic temples , burial chambers and homes still stand , carved around 2,300 years ago from the rose - hued landscape			2
logic would dictate that the relics strewn throughout the 2.8 million square feet of @entity11 would provide historians with a bounty of information about the ancient culture			2
in fact , surprisingly little is known about ancient @entity2 life and traditions			0
an estimated 85 % of the area has never been excavated , and there is precious little in the way of written records			1
" i do n't think we really understand what significance some of these structures truly had , " says @entity24 , an associate professor at @entity26 's department of anthropology			1
recently , a team of archaeoastronomers sought to gain some insight into the function of these ancient structures by measuring their celestial alignments			1
their findings , which were published in the @entity38 , suggests that the @entity2 purposefully built @entity3 's most sacred structures to align or light - up during celestial phenomena , including the summer and winter solstices and the equinoxes			1
@entity44 , the study 's leader at the @entity46 of the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , notes that the effect is particularly stunning at @entity50 , also known as @entity50 -- one of @entity3 's most visited attractions			1
" the lighting is spectacular ; the sun setting through the gate perfectly illuminates the sacred areas of the deep interior , " he says			2
" apart from the beauty of the situation itself , the effect -- which would have been observable only a week or so before and after the winter solstice -- also gives you information about the purpose of the building			0
" indeed , there 's been much debate in the archeology community over the exact function of @entity50			1
why was it built ? was it a tomb ? a temple ? prior to @entity76 's study , there have n't been any clear answers			1
" with such an alignment , it 's now clear that it was certainly a temple with an astral religious character , " says @entity76			2
" this can help us understand the religious beliefs of the @entity2 , and also their way of controlling time			0
it shows they could monitor the lunar calendar by solar and lunar observation			0
we 're really finding a lot of utility in these kind of measurements , " he adds			0
@entity96 , who was not involved in the study , but who co-heads the @entity98 , says that while she finds the findings plausible , she 's not entirely convinced by the methodology employed			1
" i think the idea that the @entity2 could have done this is actually not that surprising ; it sort of goes along with other aspects of their religion , and potentially their understanding of place and space , " she says			0
@entity96 has spent a lot of time studying the layout of monuments in @entity3 for clues as to whether the city was laid out organically , or -- as @entity76 suggest -- if it was planned			2
" the tombs seem to be based on natural topography			0
nothing in terms of their layout suggests a tie to any kind of solar orientation			0
if there was one , they 'd all be facing the same way , but they surround the city and face in an infinite number of directions , " she notes			0
@entity76 , who measured the alignment of over 30 @entity2 monuments , both in @entity3 and at other sites throughout @entity4 and @entity138 , says his measurements are too consistent to be a coincidence			1
" when you study the alignments , you produce a histogram that has a certain credibility from a statistical point of view			2
if this is by chance , the probability is very small , " he says			0

a new study claims the ruins at @entity3 , @entity4 were built to align with the sun during the solstices and equinoxes
despite the *breadth* of the ruins , only 85 % have ever been excavated
@entity162 is known about the function of many of @entity3 's structures
the study 's leader hopes his findings will shed new light on how @entity3 functioned
