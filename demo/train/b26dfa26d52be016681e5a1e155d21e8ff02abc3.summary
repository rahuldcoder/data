@entity0 -- authorities in @entity0 are working to identify the remains of an infant found in an upstate river that are believed to be those of a baby missing from @entity8 since june			1
@entity10 sgt. @entity9 said a crew of about seven @entity13 divers found the remains in a container in a very specific part of the @entity17			1
they believe they belong to @entity20 , who was 10 months old when he was reported missing			1
following " credible information from @entity13 , " investigators searched the river friday morning , according to @entity8 police chief @entity25			1
" it 's safe to say we were told a narrow area of where ( the remains ) might be and we found ( them ) there			1
we have to do our due diligence to confirm the identity , but we are confident they are the remains ( of @entity20 ) , " @entity9 said			2
the @entity37 's office will conduct the autopsy			0
@entity9 said there is no official time table for when the autopsy results will be available but said identification would likely come first			0
determining the cause of death might take months			2
he said investigators have @entity48 samples from @entity20 and his family to compare to the remains			2
he added that autopsies of children often take longer than those of adults and that being submerged in the river affected the remains			2
on thursday , the missing the child 's father , @entity57 , was arrested by @entity13 and accused of breaking into a home in a suburb of @entity8 to steal jewelry and money			1

@entity57 took two weeks to go to an attorney 's office then call police to report @entity71 's disappearance , authorities said back in june			1

" we have a lot of investigative work to be done on this case still , " @entity25 said friday			0
