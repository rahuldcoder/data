-- president @entity1 of @entity2 is on a mission -- to return his country to its rightful place as the " indispensable " @entity7 state after what he saw as the dangerous chaos of @entity12 rule under his predecessor , @entity13			1
he also is determined to resist the spread of @entity17 militancy , now entrenched in @entity18 and spilling into @entity2 from @entity19			1
since leading the ouster of @entity13 a year ago , @entity1 has hounded the @entity12 underground ; hundreds of its members have been arrested and many sentenced to death			0
@entity13 himself languishes in jail and is on trial for inciting murder and other offenses			0
@entity1 is not the first @entity2 leader to fear @entity17 militancy			1
in fact all but @entity13 have suppressed it and one -- @entity34 -- ultimately was its victim			0
and not coincidentally all but @entity13 -- stretching back to @entity36 -- were military men before becoming president			0
these two imperatives -- a sense of @entity2 's historic role and the traditional animosity of the @entity2 military toward @entity17 radicalism -- have propelled @entity2 to take a central role in the on - off cease - fire talks to end the latest @entity48 conflict			1
it helps that @entity2 's intelligence service has deep experience of dealing with the @entity53 factions and @entity54			1
@entity2 's central role also is dictated by geography			1
it is the only @entity7 state to share a border with @entity48			2
if that border is to be reopened , @entity2 will have to agree to any international monitoring mission to prevent banned goods -- the sort that would allow @entity63 to re-arm -- from entering @entity48			1
but @entity1 's government does not see itself as an " honest broker " between @entity54 and @entity63			2
@entity1 shares the @entity54 ' loathing of @entity63 , which itself sprang from the @entity12 back in 1987 and which was recently labeled a terrorist organization by an @entity2 court			1
@entity2 and @entity54 vs. @entity63 the @entity2 government is not directly negotiating with @entity63 , but with a @entity53 delegation of which @entity63 and @entity70 are a small part			1
any concessions won by the @entity53 will be claimed by the @entity74 as much as @entity63			2
while @entity13 embraced @entity63 and warned @entity54 that it would " pay a heavy price if it continues its aggression , " @entity2 and @entity54 are now in lockstep against a shared adversary			1
the last thing @entity1 wants is any sort of @entity63 victory , imagined or otherwise , that would appeal to the @entity7 street			0
one @entity54 minister described the close cooperation with @entity85 as " an odd but very welcome moment " after the hostility of the @entity13 government			2
who 's who in @entity63 ? perhaps that is why the first @entity2 cease - fire proposal was so readily accepted by @entity54			1
in the words of one diplomat in the region , " the @entity54 knew @entity63 would reject it , so they could accept it and look good , knowing that in a few hours they 'd be able to resume the demilitarization of @entity48			1
" @entity1 wants to see @entity48 demilitarized as much as @entity54 does , not just because of @entity63 but because of other actors there such as @entity70			1
@entity2 faces a host of its own security problems that would only be aggravated by a strong militant presence in @entity48			1
jihadist cells -- which @entity85 claims have been aided by @entity63 -- are now entrenched in the @entity18 , a vast area that borders @entity48 and whose lawlessness has challenged successive @entity2 governments			1
which @entity108 power brokers support @entity63 ? @entity17 militant groups are also sprouting up along the western border with @entity19			2
last month , more than 20 @entity2 soldiers were killed when gunmen crossed the desert border and attacked a checkpoint at @entity115			2
@entity1 responded by promising that " terrorism will be uprooted from every part of @entity2			2
" but the attacks have continued			0
a gun battle tuesday between security forces and suspected militants in the region of @entity123 on the @entity124 left nine dead , according to the @entity125			0
@entity1 blames the @entity12 for opening @entity2 to an influx of jihadists			0
despite its obvious motivations , @entity2 mediation is not without risk			1
@entity131 : inside the mind of @entity63 ' political leader goal of independent @entity135 ingrained the government 's control of local media may have muffled sympathetic coverage of @entity48 's plight and @entity63 ' resistance to @entity54			1
one talk - show host , @entity143 , declared the @entity2 people were " not ready to sacrifice even a single hair from the eyebrow " in defense of @entity63			2
but @entity2 see the @entity150 news channels , they see the destruction and suffering in @entity48 , and even if there are no polls to prove it , they likely expect their government to lead the way in relieving it			1
for decades , pursuing the goal of an independent @entity135 has been ingrained in @entity2 's foreign policy			1
@entity1 himself subscribes to that goal -- but with little urgency			0
he said last saturday : " we have a real opportunity to end this conflict for once and for all but we must give the @entity53 people real hope in a @entity53 state and its capital @entity170			2
" then he added as a caveat : " it might sound too early to talk about this but it must be our final goal			0
" even so , @entity2 can not assume that the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) will be pliable negotiators			0
@entity74 president @entity175 is all too aware of the support in the @entity177 for @entity63 , whose flags have been hoisted by the hundreds at recent protests			0
the longer the conflict went on , the more the @entity74 tilted toward @entity63 ' demands -- and especially its insistence on the immediate lifting of the blockade of @entity48 as the price for a permanent cease - fire			1
what is @entity63 ' endgame in @entity48 ? the only game in town @entity2 diplomacy will be tested to the full in reconciling @entity54 's insistence on the demilitarization of @entity48 as the first step and the @entity53 ' demand that borders -- land and maritime -- be reopened immediately and demilitarization form part of later negotiations			1
what is @entity54 's endgame in @entity48 ? but ultimately @entity63 knows -- as do the other @entity53 factions -- that @entity2 's is the only game in town			1
@entity63 wo n't negotiate with the @entity54 directly ( the feeling is mutual )			0
nor will the @entity54 have anything to do with @entity63 ' chief backers -- @entity210 and @entity211			0
@entity54 wants @entity1 to succeed			0
he 's the sort of @entity2 leader with whom it can do business			2
and he 's now a critical figure in an alliance that includes the @entity218 monarchies ( @entity210 excepted ) and the @entity219 in seeking to stem the tide of @entity17 militancy			1
but @entity54 officials -- and many other observers -- believe there is another reason that @entity1 aims to make himself the " indispensable " partner : to use that role to win much - needed international aid and credit for an economy on life - support			2
@entity1 inherited a mess , with fuel subsidies alone costing the state nearly $ 20 billion a year , tourism collapsing and foreign exchange reserves dwindling			0
in overthrowing the @entity12 , he quickly won financial backing from @entity238 and @entity239 , worth $ 12 billion according to some estimates			0
@entity241 in the future ? if the @entity1 government can introduce much - needed reforms to cut bureaucracy and begin to reduce subsidies , it may be able to negotiate the $ 4.8 billion loan from the @entity241 that the @entity13 government failed to secure			0
but it will need help fast : a sharp reduction in fuel subsidies last month generated scattered street protests			0
and yet subsidies still eat up one - third of the national budget , while education consumes less than six per cent			0
exactly a year ago , @entity1 gave an interview to the @entity259 , just after ousting @entity13			0
" the pains and suffering of the people are too many			0
a lot of people do n't know about the suffering			0
i am the most aware of the size of the problems in @entity2 , " he told the @entity259 's @entity266			2
" that is why i am asking : where is your support ? the title of the article should be ' @entity275 : where is your support for @entity2 ? ' " he may now feel it is more deserved than ever			0
3,300 rockets , 1,900 lives -- but is @entity108 peace as far away as ever ? why are so many civilians dying in @entity63 - @entity54 war ? has @entity48 conflict brought new low in @entity219 - @entity54 relationship ?			1

@entity2 takes a central role in the cease - fire talks to end the latest @entity48 conflict
@entity2 's president is determined to resist the spread of @entity17 militancy
@entity2 mediation is not without risks
@entity2 diplomacy will be tested reconciling @entity54 's and the @entity53 ' demands
