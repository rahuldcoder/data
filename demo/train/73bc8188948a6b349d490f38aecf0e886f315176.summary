-- scientists in @entity2 said there had been less than a one in twenty chance of tuesday 's earthquake being so destructive			1
the fatal 6.3 magnitude quake that has damaged much of @entity7 on @entity2 's @entity8 was actually an aftershock of the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck the same area in september last year			1
seismologists for @entity13 had calculated on monday that there was only a 35 % chance of a 5.0 magnitude aftershock hitting the region in the near future , but only a 4 % chance of a 6.0 or above aftershock			1
check out @entity0 's hi - res image gallery of the earthquake " it 's part of a sequence , so not uncommon , but this was so large it will have aftershocks of its own , " said dr. @entity23 of @entity13			2
tuesday 's quake caused widespread damage as the epicenter was only around 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) below the earth 's surface			1
" anything less than 10 kilometers ( 6.2 miles ) deep is really shallow , " said @entity23			0
@entity23 and his colleagues had been monitoring the region since the september 4 earthquake			2
that quake struck before dawn and authorities said the deserted streets at that time likely kept injuries to a minimum			0
most earthquakes happen away from the @entity7 region , said @entity23 , but in a country that experiences around 15,000 earthquakes each year , it was n't completely unexpected , he said			1
the majority of those quakes are hardly felt and do not damage property			0
on average @entity2 only experiences a few magnitude 6 earthquakes each year			1
prior to tuesday 's quake the most damaging to hit the country was in 1931 near @entity59 on the @entity60			1
the country is on the south western edge of the @entity62 , the ring of volcanoes and earthquakes that ring the @entity66 , and straddles the @entity66 and @entity69 - @entity68 tectonic plates			0
movement of the plates causes earthquakes across the country and volcanic activity in the @entity60			0
@entity7 is @entity2 's second biggest city on the eastern side of the @entity8			1
the population of around 390,000 and enjoys a mild climate and close proximity to beaches and mountains			0
aftershocks are expected to continue to hit the @entity7 region in the coming days and weeks			2
the usual pattern is for a large aftershock followed by others of diminishing magnitude , said @entity23			0
" the country is very seismically active			2
we probably wo n't see another ( aftershock ) this big , but there is still a statistical chance , " @entity23 cautioned			0
@entity93 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 is a *globally* a very seismically active area ; 15,000 quakes each year
seismologists had predicted only a one in twenty chance tuesday 's quake would be so destructive
@entity7 's 6.3 magnitude quake was an aftershock of a larger earthquake in september
