@entity0 -- it 's called " plucking the bird , " a strategy based on the analogy of pulling one feather at a time so the bird does n't notice until it realizes it ca n't fly			0
that appears to be how the @entity10 and its allies in @entity12 are trying to overcome what would seem to be overwhelming public support for stronger gun legislation in the aftermath of the @entity18 school massacre			2
a sophisticated campaign led by the influential gun lobby shifts the focus of the battle among various provisions , raises new arguments to old issues and proposes solutions that would expand weapons use and training instead of increasing regulation			1
" the @entity10 's modus operandi has always been to try and weaken and take down as many of these laws as possible , " noted @entity30 of @entity31 , a moderate @entity32 think tank that proposes policy compromises on major issues			2
to @entity10 officials , its efforts are all in defense of constitutional rights intended to preserve personal freedom against any kind of government encroachment , especially laws they say will hinder and harass gun owners			2
" if you are n't free to protect yourself -- when government puts its thumb on that freedom -- then you are n't free at all , '' the group 's ceo and executive vice president , @entity51 , said last month			0
the @entity10 exerts its political clout through a rating system that identifies friends and foes of its positions in @entity12 , as well as substantial contributions to political campaigns it favors or opponents of candidates it dislikes			0
on the other side , president @entity68 has been waging a public pressure campaign for tougher gun laws , an effort he continued wednesday in @entity73 , the site of two of the nation 's most notorious mass shootings			1
@entity68 on background checks : ' practical progress ' on gun violence legislators in the state , where guns and hunting are popular , recently passed stricter firearms laws similar to what @entity68 seeks at the federal level			1
" there does n't have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our @entity95 rights , " @entity68 said , calling @entity73 a model for that kind of solution			2
@entity68 did n't refer to the @entity10 by name , but he noted that opponents of tougher gun laws were " well - organized " and " well - connected			1
" he called for an honest debate , saying " we 've got to get past some of the rhetoric that gets perpetuated that breaks down trust			1
" the president will make a similar appearance on monday in @entity106 , less than four months after the @entity18 attack by a lone gunman firing a semi-automatic rifle that would be prohibited under legislation under consideration in the @entity112			1
polls show the @entity115 public backs the president 's position			0
a new survey wednesday by @entity120 's " @entity119 " and @entity121 found that 60 % of respondents want stricter laws governing the sale of firearms			0
in particular , it showed 87 % of respondents support expanded background checks , with strong backing from @entity32 , independents and @entity131			1
@entity68 complained in his speech that @entity112 opponents who are certain to filibuster any legislation will do " everything they can to avoid even allowing a vote on a proposal the overwhelming majority of the @entity115 people support			1
" " they 're saying your opinion does n't matter , " @entity68 said			2
it remained unclear whether a package of new gun laws recently passed by the @entity147 can overcome a certain filibuster by @entity131 that would block it from debate and a floor vote			1
the package includes expanding background checks to all firearms sales , tougher laws against gun trafficking and straw purchases , and studying ways to improve school safety			1
a fourth proposal that would reinstate a ban on semi-automatic firearms modeled after military assault rifles already has been dropped due to opposition by the @entity10 , all @entity131 and some @entity32 , though senate majority leader @entity165 promises a floor vote on it as an amendment			2
background checks opposed now the push for expanded background checks also could fall under assault from the @entity10 , which once backed the change			1
the proposal would add most private firearms sales to the current system in which licensed gun sellers check if a potential buyer has a criminal record or other prohibiting factor			0
the @entity10 contends record - keeping as part of an expanded background check system would serve as the first step toward a national gun registry that it considers a violation of the @entity95 right to bear arms			1
gun vote unlikely to happen next week it also says the change would fail to prevent criminals from obtaining firearms while imposing new burdens on law - abiding gun owners by including private weapons sales at gun shows and between friends in the background check system , from which they are currently exempt			1
" this idea of private individuals transferring their weapons and having to go through a background check makes no sense , " conservative sen. @entity197 , @entity199 - @entity198 , said on @entity1 's " @entity200 " on sunday			2
instead , @entity197 and the @entity10 advocate adding more information on people who are mentally ill to the existing system to prevent them from obtaining firearms			0
supporters of tougher gun laws deny that expanded background checks would lead to a national gun registry , and they argue that the current law 's exemption of private sales amounts to a loophole for straw purchasers obtaining guns for others ineligible to buy them on their own , including the mentally ill. " we 're not proposing gun registration ; we 're proposing background checks for criminals , " @entity68 declared wednesday			1
while @entity165 said he wanted a vote on the gun law package next week when the @entity112 returns from its spring break , two @entity32 sources said that was unlikely because of the hangup over background checks			1
@entity30 of @entity31 said negotiations under way between @entity234 sen. @entity233 of @entity235 and @entity32 sen. @entity236 of @entity237 would determine if a compromise on the background check provision was possible			0
if so , the backing of @entity233 , who gets an " a " rating from the @entity10 for his record on gun rights , would cause enough other @entity112 @entity131 to join him in voting with @entity32 to overcome a filibuster , she said			2
a compromise backed by @entity131 also would have more traction in the @entity234 - led @entity247			0
straw purchases provision challenged the @entity10 and @entity131 also are challenging another provision of the @entity112 legislation intended to crack down on straw purchases , arguing the current language is too broad and could penalize the original seller of a weapon that passes through several hands			0
proposed by @entity147 chairman @entity256 , @entity257 , the measure was the one in the bill that had been given the best chance of winning eventual congressional approval			0
the @entity10 's influence was on display tuesday when former @entity234 rep. @entity264 indicated to @entity1 that he differed with the @entity10 , then later clarified that he joined the organization in opposing the kind of expansion proposed by the @entity112 legislation			2
" i 'm open to expanding background checks , " @entity264 said initially in an interview about a panel he headed that was set up by the @entity10 to examine school safety following the @entity18 attack			1
such expanded checks must be done " in a way that does not infringe upon an individual and make it hard for an individual to transfer to a friend or a neighbor or somebody , " he added			0
after the remarks , an @entity10 spokesman told @entity1 that @entity264 was " not speaking " for the group			0
@entity264 later affirmed that he was not speaking for the @entity10 , and put his remarks in line with the group 's position of including only more information on people with mental illness in the existing @entity292			0
" i have been focused on school safety and the interview surprised me by almost exclusively asking about the ongoing gun control debate , " @entity264 said in an e-mail to @entity1			0
" on background checks , my recollection is that i noted there is insufficient data in the @entity292 and that needs to be fixed and expanded			1
i am certainly ' open ' to legislation that addresses expansion of data in the @entity292			0
" @entity264 's task force called tuesday for training and arming adults in schools to reduce the response time in the event of an attack like the one in @entity18			0
@entity106 assembly to vote on gun law overhaul " our mandate was to deal with the issue of inside the four walls of the classroom , the school property , for safety , because you can have your background checks , you can have all kinds of side issues or gun control , " @entity264 said			1
but those " will not make a difference for the safety in the classroom because you 've always got vulnerability there			0
" @entity1 's @entity331 , @entity332 , @entity333 , @entity334 and @entity335 contributed to this report .			0
