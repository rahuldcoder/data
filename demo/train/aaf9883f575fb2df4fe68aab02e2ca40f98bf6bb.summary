-- the leader of an @entity3 affiliate in @entity4 is calling for an end to days of bloody infighting between opposition factions , according to an online message			1
@entity10 - @entity9 , leader of the @entity3 - linked @entity11 , called on another @entity3 franchise -- the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) -- and moderate rebel groups to implement a cease - fire after more than 270 people were killed in four days of fighting between the two opposition factions , according to the @entity19			1
in a nine - minute audio message , @entity20 blamed " the incorrect policies " of @entity13 for " aggravating the conflict " between armed opposition factions , and urged a resolution to the conflict by calling for an immediate cease - fire and creating a @entity26 council made up of all relevant groups			0
the criticism of a fellow @entity3 affiliate by @entity11 is part of a longstanding dispute between the two that came to a head last october when @entity3 leader @entity36 called on @entity13 to withdraw from @entity4 , a call the group refused to heed			1
" the whole battlefield and all those in it from foreign to local fighters will pay the price for losing a great jihad and the ( @entity4 ) regime will rebound after it was near disappearing , " @entity20 warns in the new message posted on online jihadist forums			1
the call for a diplomatic solution appeared to fall on deaf ears as clashes intensified across @entity4 between rebel factions and @entity13 particularly in the fabled city of @entity54 , where the recently formed @entity55 spearheaded fighting against the predominately foreign fighting force			1
" they ( @entity13 ) have become aggressive and they have crossed the red line from trespassing to assaults to their extremist agenda , " @entity57 , spokesman for the @entity55 , told @entity0 tuesday , referring to @entity13 's radical form of @entity26 law , public executions , and imprisonment of opponents as key factors that spurred the opposition to take up arms against the @entity3 - linked group			1
according to activists and seasoned observers , the backlash against @entity13 by more than one rebel faction across multiple provinces overwhelmed the group that claims tens of thousands of fighters among its ranks and just weeks ago appeared the most predominant military force in northern @entity4 with powerful influence over the majority of population centers			2
rebels besieged at least 100 @entity13 fighters at a police station used as a base by the group in the key @entity90 neighborhood of @entity54 , and elsewhere in the province @entity13 surrendered bases and withdrew from towns and villages , the @entity19 said			0
" @entity13 can not withstand the losses they are taking and the numbers now held as prisoner of war , " @entity57 said , claiming his organization , the @entity55 , far outnumbered @entity13			0
the @entity55 boasts an estimated 40,000 fighters , making it probably the single largest rebel command , according to @entity101 , editor of the @entity102 's @entity4 in crisis website			2
in @entity107 , the first provincial capital under rebel control , full - scale fighting resulted in losses for @entity13 at dawn tuesday			2
just a day earlier insurgents freed at least 50 people held in an @entity13 detention facility , and further to the west in the @entity115 region , rebels executed at least 34 foreigner jihadists from the group			0
the infighting fueling a war - within - a - war further complicates matters for international observers such as the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) which announced tuesday it could no longer update the death toll for the more - than - three - year civil conflict			0
" we have , of course , depended on the full and transparent cooperation and sound working methods of the various groups collecting the data on the ground			0
over time there are fewer and fewer such groups still active , which brought us to a point where we felt that we are not able to produce a new detailed report , " @entity133 a spokesman for the @entity123 said , adding the count had stopped in early december .			0

the leader of an an @entity3 - linked group tells @entity4 rebels to stop infighting
more than 270 people are killed in four days of fighting between two rebel groups
if infighting goes on , " the whole battlefield *...* will pay the price , " says @entity11 leader
" the ( @entity4 ) regime will rebound after it was near disappearing , " he warns
