-- like everyone else who listened to the arguments at the @entity4 last week , i have no crystal ball for predicting whether the justices will uphold or strike down the @entity7			1
but it seemed clear to me , as it did to most observers , that the court 's five @entity12 appointees are leaning toward invalidating the act 's minimum coverage provision , the " mandate " provision that requires most @entity17 to acquire health insurance by january 2014			1
even more surprising , though , was that several of the justices also seemed inclined to strike down the entire law , all 2,700 pages of it			1
it would mark the first time in almost 80 years that the court invalidated such a significant federal law as exceeding @entity31 ' enumerated powers			2
it would also be the first time since the 1930s that it used the unconstitutionality of a law 's single provision to strike down a hugely important law in its entirety			1
the justices ' apparent willingness to take such steps suggests they may not appreciate the political stakes			2
a decision to wash away the most important federal statute in a generation , rendered in the heat of a presidential campaign , would likely unleash a political firestorm -- one that could significantly threaten the stature of the @entity4			1
opinion : after the mandate , a boom in government - run health care some justices seem to ignore public opinion			1
justices @entity59 and @entity61 have proclaimed as much			0
and it would certainly be troubling if the court were take ordinary politics into account in resolving most questions coming before it			0
but this is no ordinary case , and the court can not afford to blithely ignore how the nation 's reaction might harm its long - term institutional standing			2
as @entity73 wrote in the @entity74 , the judiciary possesses " neither force nor will , but merely judgment			0
" and the court 's ability to serve its assigned role in our constitutional system as a critical check on the political process depends on the justices ' capacity to show the nation that it is exercising principled , reasoned judgment			1
opinion : @entity89 should know better on @entity4 's role in short , the justices must maintain the nation 's faith that their decisions are grounded in legal principle rather than partisan politics			1
for if @entity17 see the court as no more than another partisan body , the justices ' capacity to persuade persons of diverse ideological hues will be lost			0
so will , in important respects , our conception of the rule of law			2
with respect to the health care law , an ideologically predictable 5 - 4 decision -- especially to invalidate the law in its entirety -- runs the risk of creating precisely such an impression			1
it would be misguided , but that is beside the point			0
the impression alone poses serious dangers			0
opinion : @entity89 was too timid on health care moreover , the constitutionality of the @entity7 is only one of several high - profile , highly ideological disputes heading the court 's way			1
in the next few years , the justices will also be confronting @entity128 's controversial immigration law ( @entity129 1070 ) ; the @entity132 's race - based undergraduate admissions program ; a sequel to @entity134 v. @entity135 , which allowed unlimited union and corporation spending in elections ; and , most likely , the constitutionality of the @entity140 , the @entity141 ( which defines marriage as a union of one man and one woman ) and @entity147 's @entity146 ( which bans same - sex marriage in that state )			2
a steady stream of 5 - 4 decisions along predictable ideological lines , led by a decision to invalidate the 2010 health law , could prove toxic			2
this is not just sour grapes from those who substantively disagree with an increasingly conservative court			0
chief justice @entity159 has eloquently voiced the same concern			0
in his numerous paeans to chief justice @entity162 , @entity159 has recognized that the court must attend to its institutional stature with great care			2
if the justices are careless with the court 's political capital , @entity159 has warned , the court will " lose its credibility and legitimacy as an institution			1
" the justices must not just be principled and nonpartisan ; they must also appear that way to the nation			0
" ultimately , the public 's faith in the justices as neutral arbiters of law is essential to the court 's legitimacy , the independence of the federal judiciary and even the rule of law			1
when that faith is diminished , something incredibly precious is lost -- something far more important than the outcome of any one case			0
i fear that the justices are playing with fire			0
for the sake of the court , i sure hope they are careful			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity195 : no one can predict how @entity4 will rule on health care law
he says there were indications that some justices would throw out entire law
@entity206 : throwing out hugely important law , in midst of campaign , would be a big risk
he says a decision *widely* viewed as political could threaten court 's stature
