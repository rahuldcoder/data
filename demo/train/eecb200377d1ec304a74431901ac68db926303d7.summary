-- " @entity1 , " in stores this week , is one wild , rolling firefight			2
set across many different terrains , it challenges players to show off their mental capabilities as well as their shooting prowess			1
the first - person shooter ( @entity11 , @entity12 ) picks up where " @entity18 " left off , with the opposition leader dead and a city in ruins after a nuclear bomb goes off			1
the gameplay quickly becomes run - and - gun , as players race to get out of a war zone where they are vastly outnumbered			1
the @entity24 , sort of a futuristic @entity27 @entity26 looking group , are on the trail of our intrepid heroes through a nuked - out city , leafy jungle , polar mountains and outer space			1
each setting presented its own challenges and really varied the tactics needed to survive			2
@entity12 producer @entity38 said the team spent the two years in production listening to fans about what they liked and did n't like from the series			2
he said the gaming engine -- the software system that runs the game -- remained the same as " @entity18 , " but that this time developers had the time to do more with it			1
" the fans requested so many things , " he said			2
" but being given time to respond has been a strength			2
we really wanted to squeeze more out of the engine and we think we 've done it			2
" the environments play a big role in gameplay , as buildings and roads crumble under the weight of armored vehicles in the city or darkened areas hide players from enemy eyes as they sneak through the jungle			1
all are well rendered and help get players immersed in the action			1
the jungle missions were probably the most fun and the most mentally challenging			0
players are forced to get stealthy -- and when i say forced , i mean it			1
the bad guys are so overwhelming that when i got spotted , there was no chance of survival despite being well - armed			1
however , the slow , methodical movements were a nice change of pace from running from building to building for survival			0
the boss battle with the towering @entity84 , a mechanical walker that could only be slowed down by shooting its exhaust ports ( @entity87 , anyone ? ) , was as frantic and bombastic as the jungle was slow			0
attacks are needed from the ground and from the air to stop this beast and do n't let your guard down for a second			0
the polar mission and the outer space mission showed off some of the vehicles you 'll get to use			0
i thought the ice - saw cycle in the snow regions was not as much fun as it could have been			1
piloting space fighters to take out battle cruisers was n't new , but it was exciting to play			1
jet packs helped hopscotch around the battlefield and reach places that could n't normally be reached			0
the @entity114 walker ( think " @entity115 " ) was bulky and hard to manage , but offered a big punch when needed			0
@entity38 said each environment was designed to have its own style of play and its own set of missions			1
he explained that emerging technology allowed them to ramp up the look of " @entity1 " from its predecessors			0
" we learned a lot and worked on leveraging new technology			0
it allows us to do a lot of cinematic tricks that @entity132 does in blockbuster movies			0
" there are plenty of cut scenes to help round out the story and move it along			0
the @entity24 leaders , voiced by @entity140 and @entity141 , are brutal and methodical in their destruction of the @entity143			0
the interaction between the two leaders builds to a resounding , if perhaps expected , crescendo			0
single player action took about 7 hours for me , but @entity38 said 8 to 10 hours was normal for completion			1
split - screen co-op for two players is also available for offline play			1
online , there are three game modes that can support up to 24 players for some of the missions			2
five different classes are available : marksman , engineer , @entity162 , @entity163 and infiltrator			2
each can earn points during the matches to improve their abilities and weapons			0
the infiltrator and @entity160 were the most interesting to play			1
the infiltrator can disguise himself as a friendly trooper until right before he slits your throat			2
the marksman is a sniper who can remain nearly invisible until an attack is made			0
@entity38 said the development team spent a lot of time working on balancing out the power for each class so no one has an overwhelming ability to tip the scales in the fight			0
it does take team work from different types of players to be successful in the multiplayer modes			2
the game also can be viewed in @entity194 during a demonstration in @entity197 , i got to play using @entity194 technology and a new peripheral ( a gun - shaped controller ) called the @entity160			1
the @entity194 aspects did n't really benefit gameplay , but they did make the game graphics a little bit better			0
the @entity160 , an attachment to the @entity208 controller , ended up being a lot more fun than i expected			1
ultimately , i would prefer to play with the @entity212 controller			2
however , i could easily see the game being played by a new person with the @entity160 for more enjoyment than a regular controller			1
" @entity1 " is n't going to blow the doors off other first - person shooter games , but it does offer a variety of missions , scenarios , and skills that make run - and - gun gaming enjoyable			1
there were very few disappointments and the multiplayer action was just as exciting as the single - player			1
and , of course , there was a cliffhanger ending so be prepared for a " @entity232 " in a couple of years			0
" @entity1 " is a @entity235 exclusive title			0
it is rated m for mature audiences due to blood and gore , intense violence and strong language			0
this review was done on the @entity235 using the @entity212 controller for single player and the move controller for multiplayer .			0
