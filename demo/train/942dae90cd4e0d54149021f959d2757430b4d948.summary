-- the airline industry 's latest tactic to increase revenue -- charging premiums for window and aisle seats -- is making it hard for groups to fly together , say passenger advocates			1
@entity10 , founder of travel site @entity11 , said his organization had received a spate of complaints from @entity16 who had struck problems being seated together on flights			2
complainants included a woman who had been unable to sit next to her husband , who had a medical condition			0
he said the problems were arising as airlines set aside more desirable window and aisle seats for passengers who pay a premium , leaving those who do not pay with center - row seats , separated from other members of their party unless they have paid the surcharge			1
" the airlines are basically trying to squeeze out more fees in the face of higher costs , and it is inconveniencing a lot of passengers , " said @entity10			1
the charges for window or aisle seats in the front half of the plane , costing as much as $ 29 each way on @entity16 domestic flights and $ 59 on international flights , are the latest of a raft of passenger fees introduced in recent years as the airline industry looks to generate new streams of revenue			1

" @entity55 spokeswoman @entity64 said the move reflected the fact that some seats were more desirable than others , and that it gave passengers greater choice and flexibility in where they were seated			2
" offering preferred seats for sale to all @entity55 passengers means that we are offering different seat selection options to enable more passengers to travel in their seat of choice , " she said			2

across the @entity87 , low - cost @entity86 rolled out reservations for certain seats across all its routes in january , while its rival @entity92 has also been experimenting with the practice			0
the implementation of end - of - row seat fees is part of a broader airline trend to charge for amenities previously included in the standard fare , such as movies , water , pillows and blankets			1
in response to soaring fuel prices four years ago , airlines also began introducing charges for checked baggage , generating huge sums			0
but last year the revenue from checked bags for @entity16 airlines fell for the first time , suggesting passengers were trying to avoid fees by packing light when they traveled			1
two @entity16 airlines , @entity60 and @entity61 , also charge passengers for carry - on baggage			1
@entity10 said part of the airlines ' rationale was " to cater to the people that have paid the most for their seats			0
" see also : seat - review sites put fliers in prime position @entity129 , of passenger rights organization @entity130 , said the aisle and window surcharges made air travel an even more daunting prospect for families			1
" families have already been having a hard time , so this is the icing on the cake , " she said			0
" can you imagine getting on a plane and not being seated next to your three - year - old ? " while gate staff would typically try to seat families together , removing aisle and window seats as options was making this impossible , said @entity148			1
" the predictability of air travel has really gone away			0
this is one more layer where people ca n't predict what 's going to happen -- it 's a crap shoot , " she said			0
" they 're holding the aisle and window seats out for higher prices -- and trust me , this is just a revenue grab			1
" @entity10 said while the new price structure was causing problems , he could understand the logic behind it			0
" when you buy a ticket to a @entity168 show , you do pay more for better seating , " he said			0
" if passengers were willing to pay higher fares at the beginning , " he said , the problems could be avoided			0
@entity64 said that the number of rows in which window and aisle seats were set aside as " preferred seating " varied from aircraft to aircraft , but did not extend through the entire plane			1
many of those who traveled in groups were leisure travelers who tended to book their fares in advance , and should encounter few difficulties being seated together , she said			0
