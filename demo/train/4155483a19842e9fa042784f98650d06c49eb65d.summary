-- the other night was one of the most sacred and extraordinary events of my life as an advocate			0
a gathering of people from all around our country with one thing in common : a desire to stop the gun violence that plagues their lives and continues to plague our nation			1
marking the one - year anniversary of the mass shooting in a @entity16 temple in @entity21 , young @entity16 of @entity17 organized a candlelight vigil against gun violence at the same gurdwara where six people were murdered			1
one would anticipate the one - year anniversary vigil to be small and somber			2
most people i meet know @entity30 and @entity31 but draw a blank when they hear @entity17			1
it simply blurs into the string of horrific mass shootings last year that each time failed to yield the solutions to gun violence that we were desperate for			1
and yet , more than 1,000 people of all faiths and backgrounds gathered in @entity21 for the vigil with many more watching online			2
holding candles and wearing scarves and turbans in solidarity , they listened to survivor stories of @entity17 and other national tragedies , from @entity50 to @entity31			1
rather than a solemn affair , the @entity16 @entity51 of @entity17 interwove tearful testimonies with multifaith prayer and music , stories and songs that repeatedly lifted up the @entity16 spirit of " @entity59 , " everlasting optimism and high spirits even in hardship and suffering			1
the @entity17 mass shooting was a national tragedy			2
it was the biggest act of violence against a faith community since the 1963 @entity69 church bombings			0
but it is also a story of how a community got up from being floored and organized for concrete social and political change			0
in a time when many who want gun violence prevention legislation are frustrated and tempted to give up , @entity17 offers hope and inspiration			1
immediately after the mass shooting , the @entity16 community rightly understood the @entity17 tragedy was part of a history of discrimination on the basis of race and religion			1
sikhs in @entity17 joined civil rights groups and allies in a national grassroots campaign calling for the @entity93 to track hate crimes against @entity16 and others vulnerable to violence			1
their work resulted in a historic @entity99 hearing on the rise of domestic terrorism and hate crimes in @entity103			1
on september 19 , 2012 , @entity104 , a teenager whose mother was gunned down in the prayer hall , became the first @entity16 in @entity103 history to testify before @entity108			2
" i want to protect other people from what happened to my mother , " @entity104 said			0
" i want to combat hate , not just against @entity16 but against all people			1
senators , i know what happened at @entity17 was not an isolated incident			2
i fear it may happen again if we do n't stand up and do something			0
" @entity104 asked the government to give his mother the dignity of being counted in hate crimes statistics			1
on friday , after a year of concerted organizing , attorney general @entity124 announced that the @entity126 will finally begin to track hate crimes against @entity51 , hindus , arabs , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity134 @entity133			1
they will be counted on the @entity137 form for the first time			0
although adding categories to an incident report might seem like a minor improvement , it is not			0
it 's impossible to combat the problem of hate - based violence in @entity103 without acknowledging that it exists			2
the policy change is an important crime - fighting tool and a civil rights victory for a community that has suffered discrimination , especially since 9/11			0
quick action that galvanized @entity17 in the wake of tragedy helped get this done			2
but it was also the result of more than a decade of sustained effort by determined community advocates , such as the @entity160 , the @entity161 and @entity162			0
now , some @entity16 @entity51 are joining the movement against gun violence for the first time			1
@entity165 , whose father @entity166 was killed fighting the gunman in the shooting , has become a prominent voice against gun violence			1
his brother , @entity171 , teamed up with former white supremacist @entity172 to educate young people about the roots of violence			2
they helped the @entity16 youth of @entity17 found @entity178 in the aftermath of the mass shooting			1
watch " @entity17 : in @entity184 , " a short film about tragedy and healing " we refused to let that act define what we became , " said @entity17 mayor @entity185			0
" we can accomplish something			0
we can make a change that 's real			0
we do n't have to wait for @entity191 or someone else to do it			0
" as a @entity16 @entity103 , i was deeply inspired that the vigil honored all victims of gun violence			1
the ceremony began and ended with a reading of the names of people murdered by guns -- a school in @entity31 , a theater in @entity30 , the streets of @entity206 and daily homicides that barely make headlines			1
between stories of victims , the drums of native american tribes flowed into @entity16 prayers and the voices of a children 's choir			0
the vigil also featured an array of representatives from some 45 groups who worked with @entity16 since the tragedy , including @entity223 at @entity224 , a multifaith social action network of 100,000 people of faith i helped found			1
the movement against gun violence has not fizzled out			2
even in the midst of the distractions of the next day 's news cycle , we must remain focused in the pursuit of solutions that make our streets and schools , homes and houses of worship , safer for all			0
@entity243 @entity16 @entity51 are among the many new voices that can re-energize the movement			0
after all , the story of @entity17 teaches us the way forward beyond the passage of reasonable legislation such as background checks			0
it reminds us to focus on curbing the impulse to violence and hate in our own homes and hearts			0
and it shows us how to keep working even when times are bleak -- in @entity59 , a spirit of relentless optimism			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			0

vigil at @entity16 temple one year after murders brings people from all faiths hurt by gun violence
@entity260 : most people know @entity30 or @entity31 but do n't *remember* @entity17
now , hate crimes lists includes @entity16 , hindus , arabs , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132
@entity260 : @entity17 will keep fighting gun violence despite all the *setbacks* in reform
