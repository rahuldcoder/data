@entity0 -- when president @entity3 raises his hand , i will put down my pen			1
or rather , i will step away from my computer keyboard			2
@entity7 will signal the culmination of an effort i launched on january 20 , 2009 , to write a letter to the @entity11 every single day of @entity3 's first term			1
and i do mean every day			2
weekends , holidays , when he was on vacation , and when i was on vacation			2
i wrote in my office , at home , in moving airplanes , cars , trains and even while running through the woods			1
i wrote early in the morning , in the middle of the day and late at night			1
i wrote about things that were important , like unemployment , @entity26 and women 's rights			1
i also wrote about things that were trivial , like sports , favorite foods and my yearly battle with @entity32 lights			1
the tally : 1,460 letters , well over a half - million words , or enough to fill about seven novels			1
laid out as one line of text , these letters would stretch almost 3Â½ miles or considerably longer than the inaugural parade route			1
i did not intend to get in this deep			1
read @entity44 's latest letter to @entity3 ... and all the others the first letter , written on that cold @entity7 four years ago , was a bit of a lark			1
some weeks earlier , @entity3 had suggested he wanted to hear from citizens about how to run the country			1
i thought it would be funny to post a series of letters for his first 10 days on the @entity55 blog			1
people liked it , i decided to go for a month , and @entity60 's - your - uncle here we are			1
the first year was easy			2
we all have ideas about what we would do if we were in charge			0
bad ideas usually , but ideas nonetheless			0
i prattled on about the economy , security , bipartisanship , foreign affairs and his bowling technique			0
the second year grew a bit harder			0
by thinking every day about the presidency , i became more aware of how many intractable , repetitive issues press down upon any person who takes that job			0
it 's @entity80 time in the third year , i surged ahead			1
having accepted that my fountain of easy ideas had run dry , i dedicated more serious thought to what i would say			0
to be sure , the letters became less entertaining , but i liked to imagine that they had more substance , although in retrospect i was probably wrong			2
and in this fourth year , i struggled			0
it seemed many days as if i 'd already said everything i had to say and then some			0
at one point i had considered writing letters to the @entity11 for the rest of my life			2
the fourth year convinced me that this would be a bad idea			0
i found myself counting the days to january			0
@entity3 's new term resolutions along the way it occurred to me that being president is probably much harder than most of us suppose			1
after all , if it is this exhausting just thinking about the job , imagine what it is like actually punching the @entity107 clock			0
truthfully , i offered very little advice			0
more often i presented general notions about how one approaches problems ; the same notions i would pass on to anyone in any position who faces daily challenges			0
which , i guess , is pretty much all of us			0
i do n't know if he ever read a single line			0
all i know is that in almost every missive , i invited the president to give me a call			1
and i do n't blame him			0
beware the tortoise whether a @entity125 or @entity126 fills that office , answering to the needs of 311 million people is a magnificent and daunting challenge , let alone answering their letters			2
so i will close my series with the same letter that started it all , by far the shortest of the bunch			0
dear mr. president , congratulations ! watching you on that podium today , surrounded by so many hundreds of thousands of @entity142 , i could not help but feel inspired by the miracle of democracy and the greatness of our nation			2
i also have a question : do you have any idea what you 've gotten yourself into ? i know you are busy today , but call when you can			2
