-- @entity2 wo n't have to maneuver the international space station to dodge a piece of debris from a @entity7 - era satellite spinning around @entity8 , the space agency announced monday			1
@entity2 says debris wo n't threaten the international space station , seen here from @entity12 in november 2008			1
mission controllers at the @entity14 in @entity15 warned earlier that a piece of the @entity17 was to pass about 1/2 mile from the space station early tuesday morning			1
but after further study , @entity2 determined no evasive action would be needed , said @entity21 , flight director for the space shuttle discovery , which is en route to the station			2
" the latest tracking information showed it is outside of our area of concern , so the station is going to be right where we expected it to be , " @entity21 told reporters at the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity26			0
@entity33 lifted off from @entity34 on sunday for a scheduled docking at 5:13 p.m. et tuesday			0
the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said @entity38 , the shuttle program 's deputy manager			0
the dimensions of the satellite debris were not known monday			1
the object was expected to pass " on the fringes " of the 2 km - by - 25 km - by - 25 km ( 1.25 mile - by - 15 mile - by - 15 mile ) safety zone controllers monitor , @entity21 said			0
" it 's a very low probability of hit -- less than one in 100,000 , " he said			0
the space shuttle @entity33 is currently headed toward the station for a scheduled docking tuesday , but the spacecraft is not threatened by the debris , said @entity38 , the shuttle program 's deputy manager			1
last week , a piece of debris forced the space station 's current crew -- astronauts @entity57 and @entity59 , and cosmonaut @entity60 -- to take shelter in its escape capsule , a rare close call for the orbiting platform , @entity2 said			1
that object , a chunk of metal from a satellite rocket motor used on an earlier space mission , was about 5 inches across , and moving at nearly 20,000 mph			1
it passed within 3 miles of the station early thursday afternoon and was detected too late for the station to maneuver out of the way , controllers said			2
ireport.com : see , share your photos of launches and space @entity38 called the prospect of two close passes in less than a week a " random " occurrence , but said controllers have frequently had to maneuver around pieces of orbital junk			2
" it 's part of the business , " he said			0
" it comes with the territory , and we 'll continue to do whatever 's necessary to avoid debris			0
" @entity0 's @entity93 contributed to this report .			0

avoidance maneuver not necessary to avoid satellite debris
the exact size of the @entity7 - era debris is *unknown* , *scientists* say
space station crew earlier was forced to take shelter because of other debris
