@entity0 , @entity1 -- our journey started with a 16 - hour drive , most of it on windy , rugged mountain roads			1
but we could only drive so far			1
as we hiked the last four kilometers to the landslide , we passed villagers trekking out single file			2
most were carrying their lives on their back , some with a child on their hip , even a few people were barefoot			2
then we started seeing bodies , body after dead body , wrapped in blankets on makeshift stretchers			1
some were carried by soldiers , some by villagers , all headed to the morgue , a parking lot designated on the side of the road			2
that night , i settled in for an uneasy sleep in the car with my producer @entity32 and photographer @entity33 , knowing it was just a preview of the devastation we would witness			2
after crisscrossing floodwaters , and dodging goat carcasses and mudflows , we reached the site of the actual slide			2
several stories of mud and rock stretched down from the mountain that had unleashed this fury			2
in every direction were soldiers heaving stone after stone and families digging with picks , shovels and their bare hands			2
the biggest hazard was the sludge , which @entity32 dubbed " quick - mud			1
" if we stepped in the wrong spot , we could easily be swallowed up			2
there was heavy machinery stranded in the deep mud			2
we carefully navigated a network of stones and unsteady planks to reach the survivors			0
one woman said she was digging for a family of eight			0
a couple lost their parents and two sons			0
another man told us he lost everyone and did n't even have a pair of chopsticks to eat with			1
after we finished a series of live shots , the sun seemed to get hotter			0
our heavy bags , filled with gear and supplies , seemed heavier			0
we ran out of water			0
one woman offered me a sip of her water , apparently the only bottle she had			0
when i refused , she tore off a piece of the cardboard box she was sitting on and handed it to me			0
she did n't have a home and had probably lost a few family members , but she wanted to make sure i 'd have a place to sit			0
sitting down was a relief , but it gave me too much time to think , look around and stare at the faces of these people who had lost so much			0
every so often , rescuers would reach another dead body and family members would break out in a chorus of wails and screams			1
then we heard screams of what may be called joy			0
a team of @entity107 ( @entity107 ) soldiers had found signs of life			0
they pulled a 52 - year - old disabled man from the wreckage			1
he had been trapped for 60 hours			1
i could n't see his face , but i saw him move , and knew he was alive			1
it was the only successful rescue that day			0
the next day we thought we might have already seen the worst , until we arrived at @entity118 , or what was left of it			1
the entire village was smothered beneath a sweeping mud plain			1
there was barely any evidence that three hundred homes once stood there			1
some people did n't know exactly where to start			0
one man said he thought he was digging into his brother 's bedroom , but still had found no evidence of a structure			1
another man , mr. @entity134 , had already found his wife 's body , but was still looking for the remains of his two sons			1
he drew a map for us , room by room , speculating about where they might have been when the landslide happened			0
a pile of blankets , bowls and a lamp shade were all he had left			0
he said he had n't been able to bury his wife yet - the town had run out of coffins			1
it was a journey filled with images we would all rather forget but will probably always remember			0
when we passed the morgue two days later , many bodies had been partially unwrapped by family members hoping to find their loved ones .			1
