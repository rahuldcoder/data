actor @entity0 first attracted @entity2 's attention in @entity3 's 1996 take of " @entity4			1
" since then he 's had roles in several major films -- " @entity8 , " " @entity7 " and the award - winning " @entity9 " -- and a long list of television shows , including " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " and " @entity15			1
" @entity0 currently stars on @entity17 's " @entity16 " as @entity16 's brother @entity18			1
it 's an impressive career for anyone trying to break into show business , but @entity0 makes it more impressive with his revelation : he was diagnosed with @entity25 's syndrome at age 6			1
@entity27 spoke with @entity0 in @entity28 , @entity29 , where he was speaking out against bullying at schools in connection with @entity33			1
the following is an excerpt of that interview : @entity27 : what was it like for you , at 6 years old , when you first started experiencing symptoms of @entity25 's ? @entity0 : my first tic was to shake my head violently			1
i was in karate class , and i was shaking violently			2
all of a sudden , i just started to notice that the teacher was looking at me , and all the kids were wondering what i was doing			2
i suddenly felt really strange			2
it was the experience of knowing that you 're doing something and that you have to do it			2
it 's impossible to stop , and that 's very unnerving , no matter what age you are			1
you 're scared , you 're interested , you 're wondering : " what is this that 's happening to me ? " i think , as with anything that comes about health-wise , it 's always going to be sort of scary and interesting at the same time			1
@entity27 : did you ever experience any violent tics , where you hurt yourself of someone around you ? @entity0 : i 've have a number of violent tics			1
with @entity25 syndrome , there 's not just compulsive actions , but compulsive thoughts as well			1
that used to scare my mother a lot			2
i 've done everything from having to slap my butt or kick my own face			0
you know , i had this tic where i touch my mouth to my knee , and i 'm always screwing up my back			0
i 've had two shoulder surgeries			0
my doctor just smiles and laughs at me			0
i probably am going to need another one , because when they do the surgery , they say the one thing you ca n't do is this ( reaches arm behind back to touch the top of his back )			0
that 's one of my biggest tics			1
@entity27 : as you started auditioning for bigger and bigger roles , did you try to hide your @entity25 's from the casting directors and producers ? @entity0 : it 's funny you should ask that question			1
when i auditioned when i was younger , i definitely hid it			0
in fact , i hid it from the @entity2 world as much as i could until , probably , my mid- 20s			0
i 'm not sure if that was a conscious effort , but it was just what i did growing up			0
it was better for me to cope that way			0
i 'd just keep it bottled up , then go somewhere else and have an outburst			0
auditioning is one of the most nerve - racking things you could ever do , but you have to be so focused that you do n't tic			0
@entity27 : watching you act , it 's almost impossible to pick up on any of your " tic - ing. " how are you able to keep it under wraps while filming your scenes ? @entity0 : this is a very old debate , and i do n't think it should be a debate , but it is			1
people believe that if you can shut your @entity25 's off for a period of time , then you can always shut it off			1
i try to explain to people that if i spent my whole life trying to control my tics , that 's all i would have time for			1
if i can just accept it , and tic when i want to and have my passion project -- what i 'm mentally , physically , emotionally invested in something -- where you 're fully focused and your body ports and mind are all moving toward this one goal , you 're focused and you can shut it off , but only for a certain period of time			1
then , you have to let loose			0
i think that 's what it 's like for most people , who let loose in other ways , doing different things			2
but to the skeptics , i would say , " i just wish you could walk in my shoes , just for an hour , to know what it feels like to have the greatest itch you 've ever had and multiply that by a thousand			0
there 's no way you ca n't scratch it			2
you have to do it			0
" some people , unfortunately , do n't believe that , and to them i would say , " step into my shoes for a day			0
" @entity27 : you 've teamed up with a foundation called @entity33 to visit schools and educate kids about @entity25 's and bullying			1
why is your work with @entity163 so important to you ? @entity0 : you know , when we do these presentations , there are some kids that probably tune it out , but you can also see there are a bunch of kids who really get it			1
when i see that one kid that really gets it , you see the light in their eye -- they identify with @entity163			0
at one point in their life , they have either been the bully or been bullied			2
they look at themselves in the mirror and they 're at an age where they 're starting to learn about their own consciousness			2
if just one kid leaves with that much more confidence , willing to talk to one more person , willing to take that shot to stop a bully in his or her tracks			0
if i see just one kid with a little sparkle in their eye , having learned something , that means the world to me .			0
