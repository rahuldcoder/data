@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , like the boy who pointed out that the emperor has no clothes , spoke the truth during her recent visit to the @entity1 holiday island of @entity0			1
or , this being the 21st century , tweeted it , which seems to get the word around even faster than a fairytale			0
more : @entity1 locals arrested over @entity18 photo yes , there are seedy x rated " ping pong " shows on @entity0 , similar to those found on @entity23 's @entity22			1
and yes , the locals will even abuse @entity1 's wildlife if there 's money to be made			2
at least the singer hit the right note about @entity30 , the island 's main tourist beach , and @entity33 , its tawdry walking street that so many @entity0 tourists for some reason find irresistible			1
over the years , we 've watched the @entity30 thoroughfare become more than just a place where you can have your souvenir holiday snap taken with a big - breasted ladyboy in a sparkly costume			0
slowly but surely , the sea , sun and sand that @entity0 has sought to promote has become sex , stinks and sleaze in @entity50			2
there 's an unmissable sewer smell from time to time -- a tribute to the local council and its ability to find excuses for doing nothing to solve @entity30 's problems			2
tuk - tuks taking over all the parking spots ? sorry , no answer there			0
roads with potholes big enough to swallow a motorcycle ? goodness , wish we could fix that			0
@entity33 's in - your - face sex show touts @entity33 says so much more about @entity30 , and @entity3 expressed it well			1
she tweeted with great honesty : " either i was phuck wasted lastnight , or i saw a @entity1 woman pull a live bird , 2 turtles , razors , shoot darts and ping pong , all out of her pu $ $ y. " the touts for the sex shows are probably the worst thing about @entity33			1
they are everywhere , sticking photos of body parts in the faces of tourists			0
nobody who takes a walk down the tourist walking street can avoid them			0
the touts should n't be there			0
the sex shows also should n't be there			1
and the poor , sad , cute slow lorises ... @entity3 said it all about them , too , in an @entity18 photograph where she held one and the poor animal looked like a ball of fur on a stick			2
in reaction to what threatened to be a deluge of bad international publicity surrounding @entity3 's revelations , @entity0 authorities arrested two loris touts sunday night			1
they were later released on bail			0
was the real issue solved ? of course not			0
the shocking state of affairs raised in @entity3 's tweet was not addressed			1
there were no sex show touts arrested			1
none of the tawdry @entity33 exhibitions closed			2
the wildlife abuses and the sex hows will go on , and on , and on			0
there 's too much corrupt money involved for them to be stopped			0
how shameful it is that it takes a visiting celebrity to highlight that the authorities in @entity30 remain blind to the sleaze and the wildlife abuse around them			0
if @entity0 seriously wants to attract quality tourists , then @entity33 is the perfect place to start a cleanup campaign			1
put @entity33 back on track , and some other celebrities just might visit @entity0 ... and tweet about the sun , sand and sea			1
more : the trouble with @entity0 and how it can be fixed the opinions of this commentary are solely those of @entity144 , an award - winning journalist based in @entity0 and founder of the regional news and information site , phuketwan.com			1
