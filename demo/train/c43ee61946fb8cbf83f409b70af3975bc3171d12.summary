the shooting death of @entity4 , an associate of the alleged mastermind of the @entity6 who was killed in a scuffle with @entity10 agents , was justified , @entity2 's @entity1 state attorney @entity0 said in an investigative report tuesday			1
as expected , the report concluded that there was no wrongdoing in the shooting of @entity16 and that " the actions of the special agent of the @entity10 were justified in self - defense and in defense of another			0
" the finding , reported by @entity23 last week , concurs with an @entity10 internal review of the shooting , which supported the agent 's account			2
it also matches what the @entity2 state attorney for @entity31 and @entity32 counties found in his investigation			1
" based on the physical evidence -- primarily the various findings of the autopsy , coupled with the reports that we received and the lack of inconsistency -- the events seemed to have occurred the way the agents said that they occurred and that there was no basis to bring criminal charges , that it was a lawful use of deadly force , " @entity35 , executive director of the state attorney 's office , told @entity23			2
evidence reviewed includes photos of the agent showing his injuries , officials said			0
the shooting occurred on may 22 , 2013 , as @entity59 state troopers , accompanied by @entity10 agents , questioned @entity4 , 27 , in his apartment in an @entity62 suburb , officials said			1
the report cites @entity10 documents that said @entity65 was writing a confession to a triple murder when when he attacked , flipping the table he was writing on and striking an @entity10 agent in the head			2
@entity65 ran to the kitchen and was heard frantically grabbing items before reappearing in the doorway wielding a long metal handle of a mop or broom			0
" there 's a belief that maybe he was looking for a knife or another weapon , " @entity35 said			2
the report said @entity16 took an attack stance with the pole and lunged violently at the agent , who fired three to four rounds			0
@entity65 went down on his knees momentarily before he " sprang " to his feet again			0
the agent fired another three to four rounds			0
@entity65 was hit seven times , with fatal shots to his head and his heart , according to the documents			0
father : ' unarmed ' son ' not crazy ' enough to attack @entity10 agent who killed him @entity59 investigators were pursuing information about a grisly 2011 triple murder that they thought could have been tied to @entity16 and @entity100 , who allegedly carried out the deadly bombing in april 2013 with his younger brother , @entity102			1
@entity100 was killed as he and his brother confronted police in the days after the bombing			2
@entity102 was later arrested and jailed			0
last week , the @entity2 chapter of the @entity107 , which called for an investigation into @entity16 's shooting , said it was conducting its own investigation of his death			1
" certainly , the @entity10 's failure to prosecute a single agent in its history for shooting a suspect does not help its credibility , " the council said in a statement			2
" our concern however is not only regarding whether the agent was justified at the time he pulled the trigger , which was the focus of the state and federal investigation , but about the pattern of civil rights abuse that occurred before , during , and after the killing of @entity4			1
" @entity4 's family has disputed that he posed any threat to the law enforcement officers and agents in his apartment			1
" my son was definitely unarmed , because he never had a gun , " his father , @entity133 , told @entity23 in @entity134 in a june 2013 interview			2
" he could n't attack them or fight them ; he could n't do anything because even two men could easily handle him			0
" @entity143 law enforcement officials said @entity16 made statements implicating himself and @entity100 in the 2011 killings			1
the @entity10 had interviewed @entity4 before about the marathon bombing because he was a friend who , like @entity100 , trained in martial arts			1
he was cooperative , and the @entity10 did n't consider him to be involved			0
still , @entity16 's shooting has raised questions about the @entity10 's handling of the matter , because any evidence he could have provided is now lost			0
" we , in particular , were only looking in fairness to mr. @entity4 and his family , and in fairness to the officers involved , to try to determine whether this particular incident was justified or not , " @entity35 said			1
no wrongdoing found in @entity10 shooting according to the investigative report , the agents knew of @entity16 's skills in mixed martial arts and his criminal history , which included acts of violence			1
the suspect refused to meet agents and state troopers at a police station , insisting instead that they come to his @entity2 apartment			1
during the nearly five - hour meeting , the suspect 's demeanor changed while discussing and eventually confessing to his involvement in the triple slaying in @entity180 , @entity59 , the report said			1
after @entity4 asked to use the bathroom , one of the law enforcement officers removed a large , samurai - type sword mounted on the wall near the kitchen , the report said			1
concerned about his changing demeanor , one trooper texted another trooper and @entity10 agent : " be on guard , he ( @entity16 ) is in a vulnerable position to do something bad			0
i see him looking around at times			0
" moments later , @entity4 attacked			1
the report said @entity4 " struck the @entity10 in the head with a coffee table and then armed himself near the front door of the address			2
as he then re-engaged the @entity10 and trooper one , they both perceived mr. @entity4 's movements towards them as being potentially life threatening			1
" @entity16 " armed himself with a red broom handle " and charged at the officers , the report said			0
" the fbi agent engaged the impending threat twice , by discharging his issued handgun a total of seven ( 7 ) times during two volleys of gunfire			0
" the use of deadly force by the agent was " reasonable and justified , and therefore , lawful , " the report concluded .			0

@entity4 knew the alleged @entity224 bombings mastermind
he was killed in @entity2 in may 2013 while being questioned about a triple *homicide*
@entity4 's family has disputed that he posed any threat to law enforcement
