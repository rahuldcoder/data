-- president @entity1 should end the legal seminar on the rights of terrorists			1
he should instruct the lawyers at the @entity7 and justice departments and @entity8 that the debate is over			0
the time has come for all to accept that terrorists can not be treated as criminals			1
the main reason is that security requires preventing attacks rather than prosecuting the perpetrators after an attack			0
this is particularly evident when we concern ourselves with terrorists who may acquire weapons of mass destruction			2
it also holds for terrorists who are willing to commit suicide attacks : they can not be tried , and they pay no mind to what might be done to them after their assault			2
finally , even terrorists not bent on committing suicide attacks are often " true believers " who are prepared to proceed despite whatever punishments the legal system may throw at them			2
in contrast to prevention , law enforcement often springs into action after a criminal has acted : when a body is found , a bank has been robbed or a child has been kidnapped			2
by and large , the criminal law approach is retrospective rather than prospective			0
law enforcement assumes that punishment serves to deter future crimes -- not to eliminate them , but to keep them at a socially acceptable level			0
this will not do for the likes of @entity50			0
nor should terrorists be treated as soldiers , a dignified profession and calling			1
soldiers wear uniforms that allow one to tell foes from civilians and thus prevent harming the latter when fighting the former			1
and the insignias that mark soldiers make it clear which governments they serve , governments that can be held accountable for their conduct -- obligations terrorists refuse to discharge			1
they can not have it both ways : flout the rules of war and seek the benefits of these rules as prisoners of war			0
@entity1 surely has the legal training to realize that our minds are big enough to cope with more than two categories , that terrorists are neither fish nor fowl , neither criminals nor soldiers , but a distinct species			1
as such , terrorists are not without any rights			1
they should not be killed if they can be captured without undue risk ; they should not be tortured ; and their detention should be subject to , say , annual review by an institutional board -- composed of people who have security clearance , not necessarily military officers			0
such a board should follow simplified procedures , as parole boards do in prisons , rather than those of civilian courts or military commissions			0
click here for more on this subject from @entity99 terrorists should not be entitled to face their accusers , or else we would divulge the sources and methods of our information - gathering about their nefarious acts			1
and they should not be released until we have strong reasons to hold that they are no longer a danger to us , our allies or anyone else			0
the @entity1 administration 's position is so multifaceted that even someone who follows it closely and has considerable training can not make out what line it is following			1
some terrorists are to be tried in civilian courts -- as long as they are not in @entity120 , or maybe only if the civilian courts are located on a military base			2
or terrorists may be kept at @entity124 , @entity125 , or shipped to countries that do not abide by our rules or maybe only to those that do			2
no one can build public support and legitimacy for such a cacophony of positions and voices			0
it is time to settle the matter and tell the government lawyers to move on			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity99 .			1

@entity99 : president @entity1 should set one clear position on treatment of terrorists
@entity99 : terrorists ca ***n't*** be treated as criminals ; prevention , not prosecution , needed
they are ***n't*** soldiers , he says , since uniforms set troops apart from civilians , show nationality
terrorists *deserve* rights but are ***n't*** entitled to face their accusers , @entity99 says
