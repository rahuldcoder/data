-- move , @entity2 's new motion controller for the @entity3 , has been nearly everywhere in the days and weeks leading up to its official release september 19			1
gaming fans and critics alike have seen what the new device can do , how it will behave and even how it will affect their current and future gaming			0
but as complex and complicated as it seems , the move had a very basic beginning			2
to paraphrase @entity14 , it all began with a ball			0
at a demo event in @entity17 , the man behind the move , @entity18 , talked about how the motion controller came to be and where he hopes it will take gaming in the future			1
as the manager of research and development for @entity2 , @entity18 said that work on the move started after they developed the @entity31 camera for the @entity32 and discovered they needed a ball to help it focus			1
" early work with the @entity31 camera got it to recognize specific shapes and colors to help it with tracking , " @entity18 said			1
" we figured out that lighting is key to tracking			0
" @entity18 and his team found that the @entity31 , which is now a part of the move system , was able to find and follow items that were sphere - or ball - shaped			1
it 's not surprising , then , that the hand controllers for the move , which started showing up in online stores this week , are topped with colored balls that have led some to compare them to ice cream cones			1
" the sphere looks the same no matter what angle you hold it , " he said			2
" the camera then tracks the location by the size of the sphere			1
bigger sphere means closer to the screen , while smaller means further away			2
" the development team used foam spheres with some success until a researcher wanted to make the spheres light up			0
it turned out that lighting the ball helped the @entity31 track the device even better			1
" [ the researcher ] wanted the sphere to change colors to reflect different things in potential gameplay , " @entity18 said			2
" what we found was that the camera worked better because the colored light in the ball makes it stand out from any background			1
" the move and @entity31 actually examine the surroundings of a player for color pixels and then assign a completely different color to light up the sphere			1
the result is a smoother tracking of movement in three dimensions , something that a similar controller for another console ca n't do			2
once they got the camera to track a lighted , colored sphere reliably , how could they turn that into a game device ? @entity18 said that for his very first rudimentary move controller , he took a regular controller for the @entity3 and put the ball on one end			1
" i cut the ends off because i wanted to make something that would feel good in one hand and had buttons to help with gameplay , " he said			0
" it was n't pretty			0
" the research - and - development team began to tweak the look and feel of the proto - move controller , adding a gyroscope and accelerometer to assist with game movement			1
@entity18 insisted that the new device keep the buttons from the @entity3 controller because he said they are needed to do specific , in - game movements			2
" you want to know you are having an effect in the game			0
buttons give you instant feedback instead of just waving a hand to get something done , " @entity18 said			0
" not only can you quickly change from item to item using buttons , the t - button [ an analog button located where your fingers wrap around the device ] allows you to control how much of something you want to do			0
it gives the players more feedback and more freedom			0
" @entity18 envisions the move controller as a device that will allow players the opportunity to explore @entity147 environments and games in ways that previously were seen in science fiction movies			1
he said the move can pinpoint the position and angle of the player 's hand in a way that 's perfect for point - of - view games			1
although his team had a good controller in hand , it was too expensive in the beginning			2
eventually , pricing of the components , specifically the gyro and accelerometer , came down			0
@entity18 said sensor technology also got better over time			0
" we could have done something early , but it would n't have been as good , " he explained			0
and if one @entity151 is good , two are better			0
" two move controllers allow for more detail , " @entity18 explained			1
" it opens up so many more possibilities for game developers to really put players in the middle of the action			0
there are a lot of things you can do as long as the platform is good			0
" he said first - person shooter games like " @entity186 " and individual sports games such as tennis , golf and archery will be the early success stories for the move			2
but he 's not counting out any game genre because , he said , developers are testing out the move to find out what it can and ca n't do			1
" i want new ways to show up to do things we have n't even thought of , " @entity18 said			0
" the move is n't going away any time soon			2

the move system grew out of the @entity31 camera for @entity32
researchers found the @entity31 tracked sphere shapes the best
using two move controllers instead of one allows for more detail
@entity2 's move controller will be officially released for sale on september 19
