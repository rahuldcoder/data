@entity0 -- when a fire alarm blared monday morning at the @entity4 , @entity2 thought it might be another drill			1
then office fire wardens came in shouting for everyone to get out as fast as possible , and " that 's when we started moving , " she told @entity1 affiliate @entity8			1
@entity9 and colleagues including @entity11 rushed out the door toward the exit			2
down the hall , they saw a man with a rifle			1
" he stepped around the corner and we heard shots , " @entity11 said			2
what seemed like two or three seconds passed , and then " he aimed his gun at us and then he fired at least two or three shots			2
" latest developments the pair provided an eyewitness account of a suspect they described as a tall black man accused by authorities of opening fire at the heavily secured @entity4 along the @entity34 , not far from the @entity35 and just blocks from where baseball 's @entity36 play			1
@entity9 said the gunman was too far away to see his face , but " we could see him with the rifle and he raised and aimed at us and fired			2

@entity48 did n't see a gunman , but he witnessed the carnage			2
he told @entity1 he was in an alley outside @entity52 to help people get down the fire escapes			1
a worker from the building approached him to say he heard someone was shooting inside			1

" in the alleyway with the amount of sound reverberating , you know exactly what it is , not to mention he 's on the ground , bleeding , " @entity48 said			0
the shootings that began around 8:20 a.m. set off chaotic scenes inside the @entity4 and in the redeveloped neighborhood around it , with the @entity78 and other law enforcement agencies converging in what seemed like a tidal wave of sirens and helicopters			1
police chief @entity84 praised the speed and cooperation by various law enforcement agencies that responded			1
after the first call , @entity0 police were on the scene " within literally two to three minutes , " she told reporters			1
" now , internal security had already engaged , identified and engaged the suspect , " @entity92 continued			0
" we already had victims down at that point			0
within seven minutes , we had active shooter teams inside the building , moving through the building			1
" the first responders found " one of the worst things we 've seen " in @entity0 , " according to @entity92			1
" as officers entered the building , they were , you know , making transmissions in and keeping command informed as to what they were coming across as they went through , " she said			0
there was gunfire still going on			0
" in the bureaucratic tone of police talk , she described a sporadic gun battle -- " mulitple engagements " -- that witnesses said lasted 40 minutes or so			1
" both metropolitan police and park police , on preliminary information , got into a final gun battle with the suspect , " @entity92 said , adding there were " multiple incidents in that time frame in which there was a gunfight with a suspect , " who now was " deceased			1
" meanwhile , workers poured out of the huge @entity4 complex into the surrounding streets			1
" everybody was going down the stairs , " @entity11 said in describing the pandemonium			0
after we came outside , people were climbing the wall , trying to get out over the wall			2
... it was just crazy			0
" @entity0 @entity4 victims in surgery @entity149 , a program coordinator at a nonprofit that works with foster children , was heading to his office nearby when he encountered what he described as a panic			1
" i had my headphones in , so i did n't know what was going on , " @entity149 , 29 , told @entity1			0
" i was listening to music , but i heard four rapid bangsâ € ” bang , bang , bang , bang			0
" at first he thought it was construction noise that has become common in the area , but about 30 seconds later , he saw a rush of people coming toward him from the @entity4			1
" i did n't know what was happening			0
i just ran with them , " @entity149 said , adding that " everyone seemed scared			0
people were crying , people were being consoled and calling loved ones and family			2
