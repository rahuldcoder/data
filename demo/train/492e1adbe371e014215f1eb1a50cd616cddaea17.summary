-- another top @entity2 official is facing accusations of racism just days after the team 's owner said he would sell his stake in the franchise after a racially charged email came to light			1
a letter obtained by @entity0 affiliate @entity13 details comments @entity14 , the team 's general manager , allegedly made about player @entity16 during a june conference call about free agents			1
" @entity14 talked about the player 's good points , and then went on to describe his negatives , stating that ' he has a little @entity22 in him			1
not in a bad way , but he 's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back , ' " said the letter from @entity24 , a minority owner of the @entity2			1
the general manager also described the player " as a two - faced liar and cheat , " the letter says			1
" we were appalled that anyone would make such a racist slur under any circumstance , much less the @entity41 of an @entity43 franchise on a major conference call			2
... @entity14 's comments were so far out of bounds that we are concerned that he has put the entire franchise in jeopardy , " @entity24 wrote			1
in the letter , @entity24 called for @entity51 , the team 's controlling owner , to ask for @entity14 's resignation and fire him if he refused			1
@entity14 , who remains the team 's general manager , apologized for the comments in a statement tuesday , describing them as " insensitive remarks			1
" " i was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players			1
i repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process , " he said in a statement released by the @entity2			1
" those words do not reflect my views , or words that i would use to describe an individual and i certainly regret it			2
" @entity2 ceo @entity74 told @entity0 that @entity75 had been punished " in excess " for the comments but gave no details			2
' i 'm proud to say i actually have a lot of @entity22 in me ' @entity16 , now a forward for the @entity82 , responded in a statement tuesday			1
" i 'm proud to say i actually have a lot of @entity22 in me , not just ' a little			2
' for my entire life , my identity has been a source of pride and strength			0
among my family and friends , in my country of @entity92 and across the broader continent of @entity22 , i can think of no greater privilege than to do what i love for a living while also representing my heritage on the highest stage , " @entity16 said in a statement released by the @entity82			1
" unfortunately , the comment about my heritage was not made with the same respect and appreciation			0
" team officials discussing his free agency should have focused on his professionalism and athletic ability , @entity16 said			2
" every person should have the right to be treated with respect and evaluated as an individual , rather than be reduced to a stereotype			0
i am saddened and disappointed that this way of thinking still exists today			0
i am even more disturbed that it was shared so freely in a business setting , " he wrote			0
" however , there is comfort in knowing that there are people who are n't comfortable with it and have the courage to speak up			0
in the same way a generalization should not define a group of people , the attitude of a few should not define a whole organization or league			0
" comments sparked investigation after the june conference call , the @entity2 brought in an outside law firm to review the organization from top to bottom in an investigation that took two months			2
that investigation turned up a racially charged e-mail @entity51 wrote to @entity75 in 2012 , describing the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season - ticket holders			0
the e-mail bemoaned the high percentage of black cheerleaders and said that white fans may have been scared away by black fans			0
" there were 19 people interviewed , 24,000 pieces of evidence looked at , and in that discovery -- that internal investigation -- this email that we released this morning was found , from @entity51 , " @entity74 told @entity0 's @entity145 on sunday night			0
" @entity51 was confronted with this email from 2012 , and he decided that instead of fighting it ... he thought it was best for the city , for the team , for his family , to walk away			0
" the reported remarks from @entity75 sparked widespread backlash on @entity160 , including criticism from @entity43 great @entity162			0
" @entity2 @entity41 @entity14 should step down after making racist statements about @entity43 player @entity16 , " @entity162 said in a @entity160 post tuesday			1
" the city of @entity167 and the @entity2 fans deserve and should demand better from the @entity2 leadership			0
@entity0 's @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 @entity41 @entity14 allegedly described @entity16 as a " two - faced liar and cheat "
" he has a little @entity22 in him , " @entity14 said , according to a letter from a team owner
