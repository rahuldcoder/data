@entity0 is no stranger to threats			1
the @entity4 artist is on an @entity6 hit list and travels everywhere with bodyguards at his side			1
he 's survived previous attempts on his life			2
but @entity0 said the shooting at a free speech forum at a @entity14 cafe was the worst			1
at the saturday event , @entity16 's ambassador to @entity17 had just spoken about the recent attack at the @entity21 magazine in @entity22			2
a woman from a feminist organization had taken the floor and started to speak			2
@entity0 realized that something was wrong			1
" we suddenly heard a lot of noise			2
there was a bang , bang , bang , and very quickly we could understand that something was going on , " he told @entity1 's @entity31 on sunday			0
@entity38 ' bodyguards sprung into action			0
" they took me and threw me into a storage room together with the chairman , " he said , " and we were put under a table there , and we were guarded by policemen with drawn guns			1
" outside the storage room , @entity0 said , a far more frightening scene was unfolding			1
a heavily armed gunman was trying to get through the doors of the cafe			0
and the police were trying to stop him			0
but it was n't a fair fight			0
" he was very well - equipped , and the policemen were not			2
so he had an advantage			0
... several of the policemen ( were ) wounded , but still they tried to fire back , " @entity0 said			1
inside the cafe , terrified audience members scrambled for cover			1
" they were hiding in corners and under tables and everything , " @entity0 said			1
" they were just waiting ( to see ) who is going to open the door there and who will come in			2
" luckily , @entity0 said , it was a wounded policeman who finally entered the cafe -- not the gunman , who police later said they 'd killed			1
the artist was n't hurt , but the gunman did kill a 55 - year - old man and wounded three officers before fleeing , police said			2
it 's impossible to know for sure what the gunman 's aims were , @entity0 said			1
but @entity0 said it 's likely that he was the target			1
controversial sketches @entity38 made depicting the @entity89 in 2007 landed him on an @entity6 hit list with a $ 100,000 bounty on his head and have sparked a number of threats and attacks against him			0
for many @entity99 , any image of @entity89 is seen as blasphemous			0
depictions that deliberately insult the prophet are even worse			0
@entity0 receives regular death threats and regularly sweeps his car for explosives			1
while speaking at a 2010 free speech forum , @entity0 was punched at the podium amid cries of " @entity108 " -- @entity109 for " @entity110 is great			1
" the event quickly descended into a brawl			0
" i 'm now such a well - known target , and that adds to value , because these guys , they work very much concerned with the media interest , so if they want to kill someone , it should be someone who is well - known			0
... and that means that when i go somewhere , i always have bodyguards , " he said			0
" i ca n't go anywhere on my own			0
" does the @entity17 attack mean he 'll pull back from public appearances ? @entity0 said he plans to keep speaking out , but he told @entity1 on monday that he 'd gone into hiding			1
he declined to specify when he first went into hiding and said he is not afraid			2
organizers of future events will take security very seriously , he said			0
@entity134 and other religions , he said , should be open to criticism because their ideology is deeply tied to social and political issues			1
" if you go into the political business , you have to play the game , " he said			0
" and as long as that goes on , criticism of @entity134 is to be continued , and rightly so			1
" @entity0 said his work and those who are discussing it are " part of a political conversation			1
" " and if you have people who want to go out with guns and start murdering people , the thing you should do is put these people in prison , because we can not accept people murdering and trying in that way to stop the discussion you have , " he said			2
such conversations , he said , are a key part of free speech and living in a democracy			0
the one responsible for the violence " is of course not the one who is following the rules and keeping a reasonable discussion going , " he said			0
" it 's those people who try to stop it with violence and murder			0
" @entity1 's @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0

" we were guarded by policemen with drawn guns , " @entity0 says
audience members scrambled for cover , he says , " hiding in corners and under tables "
