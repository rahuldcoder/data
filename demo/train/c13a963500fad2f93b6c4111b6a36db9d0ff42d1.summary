-- @entity3 president @entity2 has approved the exhumation of former @entity3 leader @entity6 's body , an official said monday			1
the approval comes days after investigators said they found high levels of a radioactive substance on some of @entity6 's personal belongings			1
last week , @entity12 , the former leader 's widow , told @entity0 that she wanted his body exhumed to find out whether he was poisoned			1
" the president is making all the contacts for the process to be done , " said @entity15 , a member of the @entity17 's executive committee			2
medical experts from @entity22 will travel to @entity23 to take samples from the body , @entity15 said			0
" the remains will be exhumed for them to take whatever necessary samples to carry out the required tests , " she said			0
the process could begin within weeks , she said			2
a @entity22 doctor said last wednesday that investigators had found high levels of toxic polonium - 210 on some of @entity6 's belongings , though it does not mean he suffered radiation poisoning			1
" we have evidence there is too much polonium , but we also have hints from the medical records that this may not be the case , " said @entity36 , director of the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity22			0
" the only way to resolve this anomaly would be by testing the body			0
" the @entity3 said last week that it would not object to exhuming the body from its tomb if @entity6 's family approves			1
if it turns out that @entity6 , who died in 2004 , was poisoned , " any result will be significant for us to help know the truth , " @entity12 said			1
" it is a form of closure for our family			0
closing one wound but opening a new one , wondering who is responsible			0
" @entity36 's research team tested @entity6 's toothbrush , clothing and keffiyeh , the trademark black - and - white headscarf he often wore , @entity36 said			1
a body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope , while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter , @entity36 said			1
a becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity			0
the fabric of @entity6 's clothing , without body fluid , contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter , @entity36 said			1
@entity12 said she was requesting the body be exhumed " to make sure 100 % of the existence of polonium			2
" @entity6 died at age 75 at a @entity83 military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma			2
@entity3 officials said in the days before his death that @entity6 had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems			1
rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but @entity3 officials denied them , and then - foreign minister @entity94 said he " totally " ruled them out			2
two weeks after @entity6 's death , his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death			1
@entity100 , who was the @entity3 observer to the @entity101 , said toxicology tests showed " no known poison " -- though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle 's death			2
" the suspicion that he was killed , that he was deliberately murdered , has been there all along , and most @entity110 believe that , " @entity15 said last week			0
" i personally believed it because i was with him ; i saw him ; i saw the transformation , and it certainly was unnatural			0
" @entity15 said she had spoken with @entity6 's doctors , who told her that they could not rule out the possibility that he had been poisoned			1
" but we did n't have any kind of thread , any kind of evidence , " she told @entity0			0
" this report , in many ways , tells us our suspicions are founded , that there is sufficient evidence to say that he was killed , that he was assassinated using polonium			0
" but getting data from items like clothing " is really tricky business , " said @entity129 , a professor and toxicologist at the @entity132 's @entity131 and @entity133			0
" we do n't have enough information to make any definitive statement , but it does seem a bit of a stretch " to conclude that @entity6 was poisoned by polonium - 210 , he told @entity0 in a telephone interview last week			1
@entity143 questioned how much confidence the @entity22 scientists could have in their measurements and said he is looking forward to results from tests carried out on the body after it is exhumed			2
" i 'd have a lot more confidence if you could give me a bone sample , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
