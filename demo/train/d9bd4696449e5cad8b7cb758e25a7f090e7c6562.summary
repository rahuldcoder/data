-- the @entity1 has banned @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and other social media sites from its networks , effective immediately			1
the @entity1 fears that social media sites such as @entity3 could pose a security risk			1
" these internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content and are particularly high risk due to information exposure , user generated content and targeting by adversaries , " reads a @entity1 order , issued monday			1
" the very nature of @entity19 [ social network sites ] creates a larger attack and exploitation window , exposes unnecessary information to adversaries and provides an easy conduit for information leakage that puts @entity27 [ operational security ] , @entity29 [ communications security ] , [ and ] personnel ... at an elevated risk of compromise			1
" the @entity1 ' ban will last a year			1
it was drawn up in response to a late july warning from @entity38 , which told the rest of the military it was considering a @entity42 - wide ban on the web 2.0 sites , due to network security concerns			2
scams , worms , and @entity47 often spread unchecked throughout social media sites , passed along from one online friend to the next			1
" the mechanisms for social networking were never designed for security and filtering			2
they make it way too easy for people with bad intentions to push malicious code to unsuspecting users , " a @entity38 source told @entity56			0
yet many within the @entity42 's highest ranks find value in the web 2.0 tools			0
the chairman of the @entity66 has 4,000 followers on @entity2			2
the @entity42 is getting ready to unveil a new home page , packed with social media tools			2
the @entity70 recently ordered all @entity72 bases to provide access to @entity3			1
top generals now blog from the battlefield			0
we will have procedures in place to deal with that , " @entity76 , the @entity42 's newly - appointed social media czar , said			2
" what we ca n't do is let security concerns trump doing business			0
we have to do business ... we need to be everywhere men and women in uniform are and the public is			0
if that 's @entity4 and @entity91 , that 's where we need to be , too , " @entity76 said			0
the @entity1 say they will issue waivers to the web 2.0 blockade , if a " mission critical need " can be proven			0
and they will continue to allow access to the military 's internal " @entity19 - like services			0
" but for most members of the @entity1 , access to the real , public social networks is now shut off for the next year			1
