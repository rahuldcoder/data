-- on wednesday , august 28 , 1963 , hundreds of thousands of @entity1 marched on the @entity2 in support of civil rights			1
from the steps of the @entity7 , the rev. @entity5 gave his iconic " @entity9 " speech , asserting the paramount importance of civil rights for all			1
the march forced the issue of civil rights onto the national agenda and into the lives of every @entity1 of every race			1
it was the culmination of years of tireless work and perseverance , all involving tremendous risk and quiet courage , much of it receiving little or no attention			2
wednesday , august 28 , is the 50th anniversary of the march on @entity27			1
the march was one of the proudest days in our nation 's history , a day when all @entity1 heard what it might sound like to " hear freedom ring			1
" people gathered in excitement over the potential of major progress in the centuries - long struggle for @entity1 equality			2
in june 1963 , president @entity41 had become the first @entity1 president to deem civil rights a " moral issue , " stating that it was an issue " as old as the @entity46 and is as clear as the @entity47 , " that @entity1 " will not be fully free until all its citizens are free			1
" @entity41 , however , was assassinated before seeing the full legislative fruits of his labor			1
following this inspiring march on @entity27 and with the strong support of president @entity54 , @entity52 passed the @entity55 and the @entity56 , both major pieces of legislation that placed the primary responsibility and power to protect every citizen 's right to vote with the federal government			1
never again would the @entity1 revert to the injustice and immorality of @entity67 laws , poll taxes and literacy tests that defined and preserved systemic racial inequality in the @entity71 before the march on @entity27			1
today , the most vital provision of the @entity56 , in effect , no longer exists			1
the preclearance provision of @entity75 requires @entity77 approval of any significant voting change in a set of nine states and parts of six others covered by a formula in @entity84 on the basis of the states ' history of racial discrimination in voting			1
although attorney general @entity91 is wisely taking @entity92 to court under @entity93 , experts insist that the crucial remedy was the preventive one provided by @entity95 and 5			2
yet in june , the @entity96 struck down @entity97 ( b ) of the @entity56 in @entity98			1
the court argued that the problem of voter disenfranchisement on the basis of race can no longer be assumed to persist in the jurisdictions identified after extensive congressional hearings in the 1960s , 1970s , 1980s and 2000s			2
therefore , the court decided , the crucial means of oversight -- pre-clearance review -- granted to the federal government in @entity112 ( b ) and 5 might no longer be necessary to secure the ends -- the right of every eligible citizen to vote -- for which those provisions were enacted and frequently re-enacted			1
instead , the list of covered jurisdictions would need to be updated by @entity52 in a continuing manner on the basis of ever - changing data			2
many legal scholars across the ideological spectrum have explained why this unprecedented decision violates long - settled constitutional principles under both the @entity127 of the 14th amendment and the long - established principle and practice , established in @entity131			0
the " @entity131 test " requires the court to defer to @entity52 regarding which means are necessary to achieve legitimate ends , so long as those means do not cross established constitutional boundaries among the branches of government or between government and individuals			0
i am not a legal scholar , but i argue that there is another , more basic and compelling reason rooted in legal precedent why the court was mistaken			0
precedent dictates that the @entity96 should exercise extreme restraint in extraordinary situations known as " political questions			1
" in @entity154 , the court outlined the factors that identified the existence of purely " political questions			0
" one of those factors is " the impossibility of a court 's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government			0
" i do not claim that the constitutionality of the @entity56 is literally a " political question " entirely beyond the purview of the federal courts ; such questions , i understand , are truly few and far between			1
what i do argue , however , is that many of the same factors that instruct the court to exercise restraint regarding political questions are applicable here			0
namely , the court had every reason to defer to congressional expertise and political accountability when hearing this case			0
in @entity98 , the court entered into the political arena , heedless of the need for caution and deference , and the resulting decision expressed a blatant lack of respect for the other branches of government and , by extension , for the @entity1 people			0
the @entity56 is a monument to the long struggle , over more than a century , for racial equality			1
the act became law because of the courage and devotion of those involved in the civil rights movement and our country , and our government has , since the act 's original passage , understood its significance as something more meaningful than just one more act of @entity52			1
in fact , the act is extraordinary in that it has been consistently revisited and reaffirmed by both democrats and @entity212 since its passage almost 50 years ago			0
included in the 1965 law was a clause stating that unless @entity52 voted to extend the @entity56 , it would expire after five years			1
in 1970 , under president @entity216 , @entity52 renewed the act for five more years			0
in 1975 , under president @entity217 , @entity52 again renewed it for another seven years			0
in 1982 , under president @entity219 , @entity52 reauthorized it for 25 years , and in 2006 , under president @entity221 , @entity52 did so again for another 25 years			0
each of these presidents signed renewals of the act			0
i will probably never be denied the right to vote			1
i am a white male with a valid form of identification living in a progressive state			0
in november , when i cast my first vote in a national election , i felt excited , proud and part of something larger than myself			1
i have trouble believing that i will be as excited and proud to participate in an election in which my peers wo n't have the same protection against voter discrimination as they did last fall			2
my whole life , i have heard that if one person in every precinct had voted differently or if one less supporter had made it to the polls , my grandfather would not have been elected president in 1960			0
in @entity98 , the @entity96 showed a lack of respect for the efforts of all those who , both in government and out , worked over the generations to uphold @entity1 's ongoing efforts to fulfill its promise of equality under the law			1
the ruling effectively erased a landmark piece of legislation that secured the culmination of a century - long struggle toward justice and equality for african - americans and minorities in @entity1			2
beyond its implications in the present , @entity56 itself is a monument to all those who fought for a voice and a vote			1
not since @entity275 had our government acted so strongly in the name of civil rights			2
in his majority opinion in @entity98 , chief justice @entity280 explained how successful the act has been in limiting racial disenfranchisement , which " is no longer the problem it once was			0
" he conceded that " these improvements are in large part because of the @entity56 " itself			1
that argument makes logical sense only if one believes that discrimination in voting in @entity1 no longer exists			2
but , i think most of us would agree that is not that case			0
the law was successful because it created an effective protection against racism by allowing the federal government to stop disenfranchisement before it became law , not after it became part of a local electoral system			2
as justice @entity304 wrote in her dissenting opinion , eliminating this law is " like throwing away your umbrella in a rain storm			0
" the act 's effectiveness makes it an important symbol of the good that government can do			0
it reminds @entity1 that their government is capable of effective action and is committed to fostering a genuine democracy for everyone			0
the civil rights movement did n't end on august 6 , 1965			2
it continued because the work of creating a truly equal country never ends			0
@entity323 plagued @entity1 throughout the ' 60s , into the ' 70s , through the ' 80s ; it continued in the ' 90s and in the first decade of the new millennium ; and it persists today			0
@entity5 's dream was not that he would be able to stop marching in a few years , once things got a little bit better			0
racism and inequality may not be as severe as before , but when " stand your ground " laws in @entity335 protect those many believe to be guilty of racially motivated violence , then surely there is work to be done			2
and when state legislatures put new barriers in the way of voters , turning them away for not having certain forms of @entity344 , then clearly we have yet to perfect the very process that makes @entity1 the democracy it promises to be for all of its citizens			0
on wednesday , august 28 , let 's remember all the work that still needs to be done			0
