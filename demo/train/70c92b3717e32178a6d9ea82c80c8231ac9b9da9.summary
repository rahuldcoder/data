-- as oil began approaching the coast of the @entity4 , environmental scientists said the effects of the spill in the @entity7 could have ecological and biological consequences for years , if not decades			1
the intricate ecosystem is a major source of seafood for the @entity4 and hundreds of species of animals and plants are at risk , experts said			0
some areas in the path of the slick are particularly sensitive to problems because unlike the rocky coast of @entity22 hit by oil from the @entity25 disaster , much of the coastline that will be hit by the @entity28 spill consists of marshy areas where the water is calmer and more difficult to clean			1
the marshes are in extreme danger , said a biologist with the @entity34 who studies coastal wetlands			2
" it 's likely going to persist for decades because it will get into the marsh where there is very little wave action and the soil is oxygen poor , " said @entity36			2
" the immediate acute impact might not be that severe because there is not much oil getting to a certain spot , but because the oil might stick around [ in the sediment ] for 20 years you might have a real chronic effect			1
" the oil spill started april 20 after an explosion on the @entity28 - operated @entity56 drilling platform in the @entity7			1
eleven oil - rig workers remain missing and are presumed dead			1
the rig sank april 22 about 50 miles off the southeast coast of @entity60 and the untapped wellhead is gushing oil into the @entity7			2
about 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion , the @entity63 said			2
wetlands in @entity60 and other @entity68 states were already struggling because of sea - level rise and the lack of sediment due to some rivers being channelized , @entity36 said			2
@entity73 , senior scientist on the global marine team for the @entity75 , said there is a lot of concern for oyster reefs , which were also already suffering			1
only 15 percent of the world 's oyster reefs remain because of over-harvesting and dredging , he said , and hurricanes have also destroyed some reefs			1
he said there have been some oil spills in @entity88 that provide clues as to what might happen			2
" what we have learned from other accidents is we 've seen mortality and then we have seen lower growth rate , " he said , " so that even if they 're not killed , you are likely to have much lower [ population ] growth			2
we 're not likely to be able to eat those oysters for quite some time because ... they hold heavy metals in their tissue			0
" he estimated that the damage to the reefs could last two to five years , but that other oil spills have shown that in some instances it can be longer than that			1
@entity73 pointed out that 40 percent of the @entity4 seafood supply comes from the northern @entity7 and 95 percent of the species in the seafood harvest are dependent on the health of the nation 's estuaries and marshes			0
environmentalist @entity116 of the @entity118 organization said the size of the oil spill will be overwhelming to cleanup crews			0
" this event is a self - feeding fire , " @entity116 said			0
" it is so big and expanding so fast that it 's pretty much beyond human response that can be effective			0
... you 're looking at a long - term poisoning of the area			0
ultimately , this will have a multidecade impact			0
" some officials worried the destruction could surpass the @entity25 disaster of 20 years ago			1
that oil tanker ran aground on the @entity137 in @entity22 's @entity138 in 1989 and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil			0
the surface oil from the @entity25 spill had largely disappeared within three years of the spill , according to studies conducted by the @entity145 's @entity144			1
the 1997 report said that what oil did remain could be found on beaches that were near still water			1
the residual oil was not nearly as toxic as the oil studied in the days after the spill			0
the report said " intertidal species can tolerate its presence even though it can accumulate in their tissues			0
" however , a 2003 study published in the journal @entity159 disputed the @entity145 finding of toxicity and said that oil in the sediment was still harming the species more than a decade after the accident			2
a spokeswoman told the @entity168 last year that oil in some parts of the sound is still toxic			0
all the scientists @entity0 spoke to said that the long - term impacts of the spill depend on how much oil reaches the coast			0
the choppy seas are hindering containment efforts , experts said			0
" the question is -- we rarely clean up more than 15 or 20 percent of a spill on a calm day , and we are n't seeing a calm day , " @entity116 said			1
the impact will also depend on what states are hit			0
@entity73 said there are two major loop currents and one runs along the @entity60 wetlands past @entity190 and @entity191 then down the coast of @entity193 and around the @entity194			1
" eventually that water moves out into the @entity200 and the @entity201 , " he said , indicating the @entity195 needs to pay attention to where the oil is traveling .			1

oil might remain in the sediment of a marsh for 20 years
oyster reefs are immediately in danger and population *recovery* may be *stunted* by lingering oil
only about 15 to 20 percent of oil can be recovered from water
currents may take oil around southern tip of @entity193 into the @entity201 , @entity200
