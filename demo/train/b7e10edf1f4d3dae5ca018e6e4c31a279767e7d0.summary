-- when i first heard of @entity2 , i was insanely jealous			1
the idea was so brain - dead simple that a lot of people -- including me -- wondered how we had n't come up with it first			2
a self - admitted tech geek , @entity9 is president of @entity12 , a blogging network			1
nowadays , @entity2 is a bustling hub of streaming video channels broadcast and viewed by dozens of thousands			1
but at its humble beginning only a few short years ago , it was really just one guy ( @entity19 ) walking around @entity20 with a webcam strapped to his head			1
it ran for 24 hours , seven days a week ( barring technical difficulties ) , whether he was being interviewed by @entity25 or chowing down on a salad			2
it was like the " show about nothing " concept pitched by @entity29 and @entity30 and made real -- and it took off instantly			2
i guess it 's like television or the rest of the @entity37 : if someone is interested enough to do it , someone else will be interested enough to view it			2
one might wonder about the sort of people so easily drawn into following such an experiment , but there were tons of us			2
yes , i say " us " because i have to count myself among its first flock of fans			2
an unedited , human - eyed peek into the life of another person ? color me fascinated ! it reminds me of how we 'd sit glued to @entity56 in the ' 80s because , even if we were n't interested in what was on at that very moment , we were constantly in suspense of what might come next			2
even if you were n't all that interested in going round n ' round with @entity64 , you might hang out for a while to watch @entity66 get blinded with science			1
but suspense is only part of the equation when trying to make sense of the phenomenon that is reality entertainment			2
i think part of the appeal is that it inspires us with the feeling that we , too , can create and participate			0
it 's an unscripted exercise ripe with the potential for adventure			0
you do n't have to be an award - winning playwright for a crack at having your voice heard by a sizeable audience			0
a tiny green fellow i once knew would be proud that it 's become more popular to " do " than to " not do " or -- worse -- " try			0
i wonder what he 's up to these days ? thus inspired , like many of you out there , i 'm one of those people who took the initiative and decided to give this " lifecasting " thing a go			1
much of my day is spent in front of a web cam , interacting with my viewers in an @entity103 chat room			1
we throw ideas around ( usually tech - related , but conversation can meander off into matters of pet care and the intricacies of quantum knitting			1
you just never know ) and i try to help people solve the computer problems that make them go " hmmm			0
" over the years , i 've found that troubleshooting is something i 'm good at doing			0
being available on the web for hours every day lets me help more people than i would have been able to even just a few short years ago			1
best of all ? i like to do it ! in another age , i could have been a black - lunged coal miner or a scurvy - withered prison ship navigator			0
yeah , i think i 'll count my 21st - century blessings			0
my joy at having found a calling in the modern world must carry across to computer monitors around the globe , because i 'm constantly being asked by my viewers how they , too , can get their foot in the lifecasting door			1
the will 's way 's been paved ; technology has adapted along with lifecasting 's popularity and it 's actually easier than ever to get started			1
all you need is a webcam , a microphone , and an internet connection			1
many live streaming services are free for personal use , though do n't rule out pre-recording videos when you 're starting out to get the hang of things before making the plunge into 100 % live lifecasting			1
i 'm not trying to discourage anyone from jumping right in with both feet , but some people find comfort in cultivating their front - of - the - camera craft before going public , and that 's fine			0
build your self - confidence and mind your mannerisms , but always expect the unexpected			0
you will get caught off guard now and again , regardless of how much preparation you think you 've done -- and that 's fine , too			0
it 'll thicken your skin			0
this will thicken your skin even more , but you might be surprised at how supportive people can be if they like what you 're doing			1
think about broadcasting social events , but always get permission			0
do n't shove a camera in someone 's face if they 're not expecting it			1
if you 're not intimidated by any of this , then go ahead and give lifecasting a try			1
have a reason to do it , even if it 's personal			0
do n't be afraid to be yourself			0
most important : have fun , and do n't take yourself too seriously .			0
