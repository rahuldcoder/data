@entity0 -- while the presidential election has topped the news much of the year , it has been pushed aside by @entity5 as the storm crashed into the @entity7			1
both president @entity8 and @entity9 , their running mates , and backers have pretty much curtailed campaigning , some fundraising and advertising as they wait to see the severity of damage from the storm			1
@entity5 overshadows candidates on @entity20 here are five things to watch for in the storm and its aftermath : 1			2
playing the commander - in - chief card president @entity8 canceled his appearance at a campaign event in @entity27 on monday to return to @entity0 to monitor the federal government 's preparation and emergency response for the hurricane			2
soon after his arrival back at the @entity34 , the president spoke to reporters in the briefing room			0
asked how the storm would impact next week 's election , @entity8 said , " i am not worried , at this point about the impact on the election			1
i 'm worried about the impact on families and i 'm worried about the impact on our first responders			1
i 'm worried about the impact on our economy and on transportation			1
the election will take care of itself next week			0
" looking presidential : the optics of leadership during a disaster before leaving for the abbreviated campaign visit to @entity27 a day earlier , @entity8 stopped by the @entity58 for an update on preparations for the coming storm and told reporters that , " it 's so important for us to respond big and respond fast as local information starts coming in			2
" call it the power of incumbency			0
" the beauty of being a president and a candidate is that when a monster storm stalks up the @entity7 , you can run over to the @entity58 and be seen as a president on the job , which also works if you are re-applying , " said @entity1 chief political correspondent @entity69 , host of @entity1 's " @entity70			2
" @entity69 : @entity5 introduces big unknown into campaign but there can also be a downside for the president : if the federal government 's response to storm damage is deemed slow and inefficient ( remember @entity87 ? ) , @entity8 may pay a political price just days before the election			1
@entity90 : how @entity5 will test @entity8 , @entity9 president @entity92 's approval rating never recovered from @entity87 , and that was a contributing factor in his party 's defeat at the polls 15 months later in the 2006 mid-term elections			1
@entity9 low profile , but for how long ? about three hours after the president canceled his appearance at a campaign rally in @entity27 and hopped on @entity104 to @entity0 , the @entity9 campaign announced that the @entity106 nominee would cancel his event monday night in @entity108			2
the campaign also announced that @entity9 's running mate , rep. @entity110 , would cancel events monday in @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity27 , and both candidates ' events for tuesday were also being scrapped			2
" out of sensitivity for the millions of @entity120 in the path of @entity5 , we are canceling tonight 's events with governor @entity9 in @entity108 and congressman @entity110 in @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity27 , " @entity9 communications director @entity116 said in a statement to reporters just before noon et on monday			1
and on the campaign trail sunday and monday before he suspended campaigning , @entity9 continuously mentioned those in harm 's way of @entity5			1
" on the eastern coast of our nation , a lot of people are enduring some very difficult times , and our hearts and our prayers go to them as we think about how tough it 's going to be there , " @entity9 said at a rally in @entity129 , @entity130			1
" so i 'd like to ask you who are here today to think about making a contribution to the @entity143 or to another relief agency , to be of help if you possibly can in any way you can imagine to help those who 're in harm 's way			0
" the optics are easy to understand			0
@entity151 does not look good while millions of @entity7 residents are getting pounded by what may end up being a very devastating storm			0
" just the forecast of a potential disaster can make politics look small , " @entity69 added			0
both campaigns stopped sending fundraising emails to supporters in the states affected by the storm , and the @entity9 campaign announced that in @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 , it was collecting supplies at its campaign offices to help local storm relief efforts			2
in @entity167 , the campaign was loading storm - relief supplies onto the @entity9 bus to be delivered			2
@entity9 campaign aids @entity5 relief effort while he ca n't compete with a sitting president leading the federal government 's storm response , @entity9 did reschedule a campaign rally in @entity180 , @entity130 tuesday and is transforming it into a disaster relief event			1
knocking the final campaign ad assault off the air it 's as simple as this : if the storm knocks out your power , you ca n't watch tv			0
both campaigns are planning to spend tens of millions of dollars on a final assault of campaign commercials			0
but @entity5 could knock those plans off the air in such battleground states as @entity167 , @entity165 , @entity164 , and the lean @entity8 - state of @entity166 , which are all in the storm 's path			1
and while it wo n't get a direct hit , battleground @entity130 will also feel the wrath of @entity5			0
do the math : the @entity202 " in areas without power and thus without either tv advertising or tv news , the race is likely to be frozen in place , " said @entity203 , vice president at @entity204 , which tracks political ad spending on broadcast and national cable tv			0
but she said it was rare for an entire media market to be without power , so advertising would continue in those markets with both campaigns hoping for a restoration of service as soon as possible			0
@entity203 adds that the campaigns may be forced to go heavier on the ground , or do more radio or print ads , in order to reach areas that remain without power well into the week			0
by the numbers : swing states 4			0
will the storm stifle early voting ? the answer is yes , but not in states that are in play			1
@entity235 and the @entity0 suspended early voting monday because of @entity5			1
but the president is expected to easily carry both			0
the storm did impact some early voting in some of the eastern portions of the swing state of @entity164 , and could put a damper on some early voting in northern and eastern @entity130			1
and in the battleground state of @entity167 , which allows limited absentee voting in advance of @entity247 , some counties monday canceled such in - person absentee voting			0
if the storm does put a dent in early voting , the @entity8 campaign would feel the bigger impact , as it seems to rely more on pre-election day voting than the @entity9 campaign			1
by the numbers : early voting " obviously we want unfettered access to the polls because we believe that the more people come out , the better we 're going to do , and so to the extent that it makes it harder , you know , that 's a source of concern , " @entity8 campaign senior adviser @entity256 said on " @entity70			1
pulling the plug on polling with just a week to go until @entity247 , expect a flood of final polling			0
the storm is washing out some polling organizations ' plans			0
both @entity271 and @entity273 / @entity272 announced monday that they were temporarily suspending their daily national tracking polls			0
and in some of the states directly impacted by the storm , polling may become much more difficult , as @entity5 knocks out phone lines and some cell service			1
@entity281 poll : @entity9 48 % -- @entity8 47 % @entity1 poll : @entity9 50 % -- @entity8 49 % in @entity27 poll : locked up race in @entity164 poll : @entity8 up three points in @entity287 poll : @entity8 advantage in @entity167 where the race stands : @entity1 poll of polls			2

campaign events were *largely* suspended monday as @entity5 *approached* the @entity7
@entity8 : " i 'm worried about the impact on families and i 'm worried about the impact on our first responders "
@entity9 : " a lot of people are enduring some very difficult times , and our hearts and our prayers go to them "
the storm could also affect tv ads , early voting , and polling in some of the battleground states
