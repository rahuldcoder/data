-- " whip it ! " suggests what might have happened if @entity2 had gone to a high school as poky as @entity4 's and decided that although her mother wanted her to be a beauty queen like @entity8 , she 'd rather just strap on roller skates			1
@entity10 plays roller derby competitor @entity11 in " whip it ! " only here the petite , droll , feisty , @entity10 - like heroine played by @entity10 is named @entity15			1
and her idea of sass while chatting up a cute rocker ( @entity18 ) in this desexualized , slow - speed grrrl - power sports fantasy is " i 'm @entity15 , but i could change that			0
" @entity15 does change her name , at least at the @entity23 rink			0
she sneaks away from her square parents ( @entity25 as the @entity27 's least likely mail carrier and @entity28 as a nice schlub who likes beer ) to roll with a sisterly @entity33 team who call themselves the @entity35			2
there , she dubs herself @entity37 , making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression			0
she 's heck on wheels , or so we are asked to believe : the rink footage is pretty un-whippy			2
even @entity49 , playing the film 's designated bad girl and @entity15 / @entity37 's nemesis on the rink , is more of a cute bee - yotch than a real threat			1
the movie is @entity54 's directorial debut ( she also plays fellow @entity55 ) , and it 's clear she 's more attuned to grrrlishness than real athletic power : @entity58 is the first to scream '' food fight ! '' and the 34 - year - old actress leads the charge in kidlike mayhem			1
