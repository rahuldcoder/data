it 's deja vu , drug lord style			0
@entity3 authorities say they gunned down notorious cartel leader @entity4 on sunday			1
by most measures , it sounds like a major victory in the government 's fight against organized crime			0
but there 's a catch			0
he was supposed to be dead already			0
in 2010 , then - @entity3 president @entity15 's government trumpeted @entity17 's death , announcing that he 'd been killed after two days of shootouts between armed forces and criminals			1
officials revealed a surprising twist on sunday , announcing the 2010 report of his death was inaccurate			1
@entity25 , executive secretary of @entity3 's @entity26 , said @entity17 was very much alive when federal troops cornered him on sunday			1
they planned to arrest him , @entity29 said , but @entity17 was fatally shot after he opened fire			2
for years , rumors have swirled about @entity17			2
critics said the @entity3 government had never proven that @entity17 had been slain after the 2010 announcement			1
federal authorities initially said they could n't provide physical evidence because @entity17 's body had been collected by fellow cartel members after clashes			1
in 2011 , state prosecutors acknowledged they 'd never recovered @entity17 's body and could n't confirm he was dead			1
" we 've never found a body , fingerprints , photographs , " @entity41 , a @entity3 expert at the @entity42 , told @entity43 that year			1
" we know his burial site , but no one has exhumed the body			2
there are a lot of questions			0
" authorities received numerous reports that @entity17 remained alive , @entity29 said sunday , on sunday , @entity3 authorities said fingerprint tests had confirmed that @entity17 was really the one they killed this time , but they were still awaiting dna test results			1
more on the @entity59 cartel founder ' known for his dangerousness ' @entity17 -- nicknamed " @entity62 , " " @entity4 " and " @entity63 " -- was " known for his dangerousness , " @entity29 said sunday			1
he was a founder of @entity65 , a cartel that started in the western @entity3 state of @entity67 and grabbed national attention in 2006 after reportedly hurling five decapitated heads of rival gang members onto a dance floor			2
the group began splintering soon after authorities announced @entity17 's death in 2010 , and a similar spinoff organization known as the @entity76 effectively took @entity65 's place as the dominant group in the region			1
the @entity76 has increasingly found itself in the @entity3 government 's cross-hairs in recent months as citizen self - defense militias in @entity67 pressured authorities to crack down on the cartel and capture @entity17 , who they claimed was still alive and leading the group			1
on sunday , @entity3 officials described his death as " the most important blow to the criminal group that he headed " and said he was " the undisputed leader of the criminal group that dominates the state , " but did n't mention the group 's name			1
toning down the rhetoric about drug cartels has been part of @entity3 president @entity97 's security strategy since he took office in december 2012			2
authorities have largely stopped parading suspects before cameras after high - profile arrests and seem to be making an effort to avoid actions that could be seen as glorifying cartels			2
' spiritual leader ' a @entity3 government dossier released in 2010 described @entity17 as the brains behind many killings			1
authorities said he was a self - fashioned " spiritual leader " who used religion to recruit criminals and strengthen his stronghold			2
as a teenager , he was a migrant worker in the @entity117 and worked in several locations in @entity119 , the profile said			0
he was arrested for the first time on drug trafficking charges in @entity122 , @entity123 , in 1994			0
" @entity17 started as a migrant in @entity119 , continued trafficking marijuana on the border and became the leader of one of the most violent criminal organizations in the history of @entity3 , " the report said			1
in @entity3 , @entity17 dubbed himself the " savior of the people " and crafted @entity65 's philosophy , outlined in a " bible " provided to new recruits			1
@entity65 's approach showed a " strong religious background , " the @entity137 said in 2009			0
" it purportedly originated to protect locals from the violence of drug cartels			0
now , @entity65 uses drug proceeds to fuel their agenda that encompasses a @entity147 - type mentality -- steal from the rich and give to the poor , " the @entity137 said			0
" they believe they are doing @entity152 's work , and pass out bibles and money to the poor			0
@entity65 also gives money to schools and local officials			0
" in 2011 , the @entity76 announced its presence and took a similar approach , with banners hanging in prominent locations vowing to protect residents of @entity67			0
" our commitment to society will be to preserve order and prevent robbery , kidnapping and extortion , and protect the state from interventions by rival organizations , " the signs said			0
in a raid aimed at cracking down on the new cartel that year , @entity3 police seized white robes emblazoned with bright red crosses and handbooks outlining a code for the @entity76			2
analysts have long pointed to such finds as a sign that the @entity76 also used religion to recruit and retain members			0
