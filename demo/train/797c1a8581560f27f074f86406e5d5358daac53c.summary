-- democracy leader @entity2 's victory in @entity3 's by - elections on sunday represents the nascent return of opposition politics to the country after nearly half a century of military rule			1
it also has created an opportunity for the @entity11 to begin easing economic sanctions that are hindering reform			1
@entity2 , kept under house arrest by the government for 15 years , won a seat in the parliament with a handy plurality			1
votes continue to be tallied , but reports indicate that her @entity21 ( @entity21 ) party captured most of the 45 seats up for grabs			0
the military - backed @entity24 ( @entity24 ) will maintain its grip on the majority of the 662 seats in the @entity28 , but now opposition members will have a voice in lawmaking			0
the international community should take this moment to encourage @entity3 's moves toward liberalization			1
for the @entity11 , the time has come to seriously address its myriad financial sanctions on @entity3 to ensure that they are not working at cross-purposes with reform efforts			1
the reformers in @entity3 believe that popular support for the political transition can be consolidated only if real improvements in the quality of life can be delivered to the country 's poverty - struck masses and struggling middle class			2
they fear that if the country 's economic decline is not arrested and reversed relatively soon , it will lead to widespread dissatisfaction and instability , threatening a return to harsh security measures			2
the draconian application of @entity11 financial sanctions is having a serious negative impact on legitimate economic actors in @entity3 who are struggling to institute positive changes			1
they are also impeding @entity11 who are working to assist in the reforms			0
while those aspects of the financial sanctions aimed at inhibiting corrupt economic activity should be retained , they should be modified to ensure that they do not prevent legitimate financial transactions essential to the development of a vibrant private sector , that they allow wider assistance for capacity building which @entity3 so urgently needs , and that they contribute positively to the transformation of the country 's banking and financial system			1
gradually easing the trade sanctions could help develop certain sectors of the economy as they begin to expand			0
investment sanctions should also be reduced as the macroeconomic structures are reformed and anticorruption measures are put in place			0
the complex web of @entity11 sanctions targeted at @entity3 over the past 20 years includes five federal laws and four presidential executive orders , all of which require different conditions to be met for lifting			1
throughout the sanctions - building process , very little thought was given to how to unpack them if and when it was warranted			0
by necessity , this will be a gradual process , enabling the @entity11 to continue to test the commitment of president @entity101 's government to pursuing democratic reforms , halting conflict in ethnic areas and seeking a genuine political settlement and expanding individual freedoms and civic activity			2
some of @entity3 's new leaders are trying to move decisively in the direction of democracy , free enterprise , and the protection of human rights , which the @entity11 has been advocating for decades			1
to insist on solutions to all of the country 's problems before sanctions can be relieved at all would be self - defeating			0
a more reliable measure of progress than the by - elections will come in 2015 , when @entity3 plans to hold its next general elections			0
by this time , the civilian population should have a better idea of whether the government is making sincere efforts to serve the public interest , whether it is safe to run for office and engage openly in political activity , and whether a new generation of socially responsible political and military leaders is emerging			0
the @entity11 should do all it can to help @entity3 get to this point			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0
