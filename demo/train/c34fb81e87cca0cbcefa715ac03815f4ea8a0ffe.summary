@entity0 -- the ebola virus is coming to the @entity3 for what 's thought to be the first time , as two @entity3 return home after getting infected while helping others cope with the outbreak ravaging @entity9			1
the first patient is expected to arrive in the @entity3 on saturday afternoon , @entity3 officials said			1
the aircraft carrying that person will land at @entity15 's @entity14 , then take off again for @entity16 to get the second @entity3 infected with @entity17			1
both are expected to head to @entity19 in @entity0 , according to dr. @entity20 , who oversees the special isolation unit where they will be treated			2
on friday , he described the patients as " stable " and " safe to transport			0
" there was an @entity17 strain tied to monkeys -- @entity17 - @entity27 -- in the @entity3 during the 1990s , though no humans got sick from it , according to the @entity30			1
thus , what is happening now appears to be the first time a symptomatic person with @entity17 will be in the country and treated at a @entity3 hospital			1
the @entity19 unit -- created in conjunction with the @entity30 , which is based down the road -- that will care for these patients is designed to optimize care for those with infectious diseases while safeguarding health care workers and visitors			0
@entity19 's hospital is one of only four @entity3 institutions capable of such care , according to @entity20			1
' training for this ' : @entity0 hospital ready he pointed out many precautions in place to prevent the deadly virus from spreading			0
these include controlling everything that comes into and out of the unit , " special air handling " and windows and an intercom so guests can interact with patients without being in the room			0
as one of four physicians overseeing the patients ' treatment , @entity20 said , " i have no concerns about either my personal health or the health of the other health care workers who will be working in that unit			0
" @entity17 is n't " some mystical pathogen ( with ) some bizarre mode of transmission , " the doctor noted , adding that it is transmitted similarly to illnesses like @entity78 or @entity79			1
but while the @entity19 staff members are confident , that does n't mean they have experience dealing with @entity17 , which the @entity83 reports has infected more than 1,300 people and killed over 700 this year in @entity16 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
in fact , no @entity3 medical facility has had a known patient with the virus			1
that 's because , as @entity20 pointed out , " this particular pathogen is new to the @entity3			1
" evacuations trigger fear in @entity3 after the evacuation plans became public thursday , many @entity3 reacted on social media with fear and trepidation -- questioning why anyone would bring such a dangerous disease into this country voluntarily			1
" the road to hell was paved with good intentions , " wrote one person , using the hashtag # @entity103			0
" what do we say to our kids when they get sick & die ? " on the website of conspiracy talker @entity113 , who has long purported the @entity30 could unleash a pandemic and the government would react by instituting authoritarian rule , the news was a feast of fodder			0
" feds would exercise draconian emergency powers if @entity17 hits @entity3 , " a headline read on infowars.com			1
@entity20 repeatedly downplayed the risk for anyone who will be in contact with @entity126 or @entity127			0
the doctor noted the two patients -- @entity127 and dr. @entity126 -- are both health care workers had put themselves at risk by going to @entity9 to help people in need			2
" we have two individuals who are critically ill , and we feel that we owe them the right to receive the best medical care , " @entity20 said , adding that the two will have a much better chance being treated in the @entity3 than in @entity9			1
still , even if @entity126 and @entity127 do n't spread @entity17 in the @entity3 , others might			1
many experts have said that other people will probably come to the country with @entity17 at some point			2
it takes a while for symptoms -- which start out like many diseases , including common flus , with headaches , fever , nausea and diarrhea , then progress to abdominal pain and bleeding -- to break out			0
an infected person can get onto a plane feeling fine , then fall ill after landing			2
the fight against @entity17 for all the concerns about the @entity3 , it 's nothing compared to the harsh reality in @entity9			1
@entity17 has been spread before in the past 40 years , but never like this			2
dr. @entity162 , the head of the @entity83 , on friday described what 's happening there as " an unprecedented outbreak accompanied by unprecedented challenges			1
" dr. @entity167 , director of the @entity30 , said that even in a best - case scenario , it could take three to six months to stem the epidemic in @entity9			1
@entity171 noted that the virus is moving over porous borders , by plane			2
it has gone into rural areas where it 's hard to get adequate treatment , as well as crowded cities where it can spread more easily			0
worst of all , she said , " this outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it			2
if the situation continues to deteriorate , the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives , but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries			0
" so what can be done ? there is no standardized treatment ; the most common approach is to support organ functions and keep up bodily fluids like blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection			0
nor is there a vaccine , though one is in the works			0
the @entity209 announced thursday that it will begin testing an experimental @entity17 vaccine in people as early as september			2
tests on primates have been successful			0
the announcement came the same day the @entity30 issued a level three alert for @entity86 , @entity16 and @entity85 , warning against any nonessential travel to the region			2
as of now , the outbreak has been confined to @entity9 , but it is getting worse there			1
although infections are dropping off in @entity86 , they are on the rise in @entity16 and @entity85			2
in her statement , @entity171 said the calamity can be curbed , especially if the world steps up to provide equipment , experts , supplies and other resources for the most affected countries			0
" ebola outbreaks can be contained , " she said			0
" chains of transmission can be broken			0
together , we must do so			0
" ebola doctor in @entity85 dies what you need to know @entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
