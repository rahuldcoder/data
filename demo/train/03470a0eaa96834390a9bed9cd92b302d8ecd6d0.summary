-- penguins did n't always come in black and white , paleontologists said thursday , citing the discovery of a 36 - million - year - old fossil of a bird that , in its day , waddled nearly 5 feet tall			1
a specimen found in @entity7 showed that at least some of the giant penguin 's feathers were reddish brown and gray , said a @entity13 paleontologist who was the lead author of a paper appearing in thursday 's online edition of the journal @entity17			1
the new species , " @entity20 , " or " water king , " was bigger than the emperor penguin , the largest living penguin now			1
" before this fossil , we had no evidence about the feathers , colors and flipper shapes of ancient penguins			1
we had questions and this was our first chance to start answering them , " paleontologist @entity30 said in a statement			0
the color pattern of living penguins is a more recent innovation , said scientists			0
the fossil shows the flipper and feather shapes that evolved early to make them such powerful swimmers			2
the fossil also has preserved evidence of scales and feathers			1
bird feathers get some of their colors from the size , shape and arrangement of nanoscale structures called melanosomes , the report said			2
modern penguins and the fossil differed in the formation of melanosomes			2
@entity20 was discovered in 2007 by @entity7 student @entity62 in @entity63 , researchers said			1
the @entity64 , which along with the @entity65 , provided funding for the research , said it 's not exactly clear why modern penguins come in black and white			0
perhaps it was a response to the rise of new penguin predators , such as seals , said @entity74 , according to @entity64			0
in a phenomenon called countershading , modern penguins ' white bellies camouflage the birds against the sky , at least from the vantage point of a swimming predator looking up			0
to a predator looking down , a penguin 's black back vaguely matches the dark depths below .			0
