twelve years ago , @entity0 was lost when it came to her son @entity2			1
the 7 - year - old was profoundly disabled because of his autism			0
unable to speak , he withdrew from people at school and , worse , from his family			0
in march 2003 , @entity0 was introduced to @entity10 , a one - on - one therapist for people with autism , and things started to feel a little more manageable			1
@entity10 was hired to be @entity2 's companion			1
the two would go people - watching at the mall in @entity18 , @entity19 , on the weekends			2
@entity10 chatted throughout their excursions , even though @entity2 could n't talk back			1
their relationship evolved when @entity10 introduced @entity2 to the @entity24 in @entity25			1
@entity10 , a longtime volunteer for the organization , and @entity0 decided @entity2 should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight : whenever @entity2 was running or being active , he was smiling			1
up until that point , @entity0 said , it was virtually impossible to get @entity2 involved with sports because of his condition			1
" there were very few people who knew how to handle a disability as severe as @entity2 's , " she said			1
" even teachers and professionals were unable to reach him			0
" one area of difficulty was communication			0
@entity2 could n't speak and was mainly unresponsive to people			2
and people distanced themselves when they saw the teen injure himself			0
@entity2 would bite his arms and hands and even hit himself with powerful blows to the head , @entity0 said			1
as @entity2 got older , his behavioral issues intensified			2
but while teachers and peers drew away , @entity10 stood closer by his side			2
when @entity2 turned 12 , @entity10 introduced him to track at the @entity24			1
for the first three years , the pair just observed the sport by watching practices and events			0
@entity10 worked daily with @entity2 , showing him everything , including where to sit , stand and walk , so he would understand the flow of the events			1
eventually , the lessons clicked , and @entity2 was off doing 50 - meter sprints			2
@entity2 was racing because he loved to run , not because he wanted to compete , @entity10 explained			1
" winning is not in his vocabulary			0
we put him in smaller races so that he could finish , " @entity10 said			2
finishing the races was a way to boost @entity2 's confidence			1
" he learned that when he finished the race he could see his mom , and get a drink , and get hugs			0
" but as @entity2 got older , he got stronger and faster			2
at 16 , he was jumping hurdles and doing 800 - meter races			0
@entity0 started seeing her son as a serious athlete			2
off the field , @entity2 was closed off to the world , but on the track he shined			0
" @entity2 's head will be down a lot when he is trying to have social interactions			1
but when he is running , his form is perfect , " she said			0
@entity2 even verbalizes on the field , joyously yelling			0
" it sounds like he is happy , " @entity0 said			0
in may 2014 , @entity2 's training brought him to the @entity92 in @entity93			1
the 18 - year - old was competing in the 800 meters and the 110 - meter hurdles			0
as the 800 was setting up , @entity0 remembered , she pressed her face against the fence , anxiously waiting for @entity2 to compete			1
the lanes were filled and the runners took their positions			0
@entity0 's mind raced : would @entity2 would be ok in front of hundreds of cheering spectators ? would he would trip ? would he even finish ? but as soon as the race started , her fears melted away , and all @entity0 saw was an athlete , her athlete			1
" i just wanted to see the best performance			0
it seemed much more significant than whether he would ever speak or respond to me , " she said			0
@entity2 ended up winning the gold medal for the 800			0
sports completely changed @entity2 , and @entity0 said that is because of @entity10			1
" a person with a disability can feel hopeless and isolated , and i think that can happen to parents , too			0
@entity10 probably saw that with us , " @entity0 said , thinking back to when @entity10 first met their family			1
" @entity2 was never expected to be an athlete , " @entity0 said			2
" but if @entity2 could speak , he would say his coach always expected it			0

@entity0 's son @entity2 , 18 , is severely autistic and struggles with personal *connections*
@entity2 's joy in running became apparent to her and therapist @entity10 , who has known @entity2 since 2003
in 2014 , @entity2 raced in the @entity92 in @entity19
