@entity0 has built a $ 12 billion company in an endeavor to pave the way to @entity5 for humanity			1
he insists that @entity5 is a " long - term insurance policy " for " the light of consciousness " in the face of climate change , extinction events , and our recklessness with technology			1
on the other hand , astronaut @entity16 is skeptical : " humanity is not going extinct , " he told me			0
he added : " there 's no great compelling reason to go , apart from curiosity , and that 's not going to be enough to sustain the immense cost necessary with the technology that exists right now			0
" but i question our future , stuck here on @entity29			0
our environment is a highly balanced system and we are the destabilizing element			0
pursuing " green " initiatives is no long - term solution to the wall we 're hurtling towards , they 're speed bumps			1
if this is where humankind is destined to remain , then we shall find ourselves fighting over whatever is left of it			0
politically speaking , sending humans into space brings nations together -- the @entity44 stood as the physical manifestation of the reunification of the @entity47 and @entity48 and is now a platform for broader international cooperation			0
space exploration is also inspiring : during @entity58 's @entity57 , the number of graduates in mathematics , engineering and the sciences in the @entity47 doubled			0
igniting the imagination of that generation helped propel the @entity47 into the dominant position it 's held since the 1960s			2
what could a @entity5 program do ? would n't the @entity66 , so much nearer than @entity5 , be a better first step ? actually , no -- it 's just too different			1
it 's better to test hardware and train people in analogs on @entity29 , such as the geologically similar high - altitude desert in @entity74 or the cold and dry @entity77 @entity76 desert			2
why the @entity78 has declared the @entity66 a stepping - stone to @entity5 is beyond me , as doing so increases the cost of a @entity5 program hugely			1
it takes about 50 % more energy to put something on the surface of the @entity66 than it does on @entity5			1
the @entity5 atmosphere can be used to slow down approaching spacecraft , instead of the need for extra fuel to slow the descent			1
it would also mean developing two different sets of landing techniques and hardware			0
there are reasons to go to the @entity66 , just not if your ultimate destination is @entity5			1
even colonizing the @entity66 is questionable : it simply has n't the resources to sustain an advanced colony			1
@entity5 has fertile soil , an abundance of water ( as ice ) , a carbon - dioxide rich atmosphere and a 24 - and - a - half hour day			1
the @entity66 's soil is not fertile , water is as rare , it has no effective atmosphere , and a 708 - hour day			1
it 's feasible to introduce biological life to @entity5 , but not the @entity66			1
with only a relatively small push , @entity5 could be returned to its former warm , wet , hospitable state			1
raising the temperature at the south pole by a few degrees would see frozen co2 in the soil begin to gasify			0
as a greenhouse gas , it would further raise the temperature , gasifying more co2 in a self - sustained global - warming process			2
eventually , water frozen into the soil would liquefy , covering half of the planet			0
after about a century , @entity5 would settle down with an atmosphere about as dense as the lowland @entity125 and a climate suitable for t - shirts			1
@entity16 warns that " we need to invent a lot of things " before going to @entity5 , and that " there 's no great advantage to being the early explorers who die "			1
few would disagree with that , but what are the challenges a crewed mission to @entity5 faces ? radiation : an astronaut would receive a lifetime allowable dose of radiation in a single 30 - month round - trip , including 18 months on the surface			1
but this is only equivalent to increasing the lifetime cancer risk from about 20 % to 23 %			0
as the majority of this is received in transit between planets , with proper radiological protection on the ship , it would actually be ( radiologically speaking ) healthier for an astronaut to live on @entity5 with a radiation dose of 0.10 sieverts per year than to smoke on @entity29 at 0.16 sieverts per year			1
there is no single practical solution to the radiation problem			0
one strategy i helped develop was to optimise the internal layout of the equipment and structures in the @entity5 habitat module to minimise exposure -- placing existing bulk in all the right places			1
this reduced exposure by about 20 % , without adding any mass. even taking empty sandbags , packing them with @entity5 soil and putting them on the roof would be a simple and effective measure on @entity5			2
radiation is an issue to tackle , but it 's not a deal - breaker			0
power : " we need a compact energy source , " says @entity16			0
" we can not be relying on the tiny bit of solar power that happens to arrive at that location			0
" while the solar energy reaching the surface of @entity5 is about half that on @entity29 , this is n't a show - stopper			1
a quick back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that to power the equivalent of an average @entity47 household on @entity5 , even through dust storms , one would need an array of solar panels totalling six metres square -- very achievable			1
reduced gravity : the effects of microgravity on astronauts ' health have been studied for decades , and a range of techniques have been developed to mitigate the wasting effects on muscle and bone			0
with @entity5 gravity around a third of that on @entity29 , it would take astronauts a couple of days to acclimatize , and perhaps a few months to fully adapt			2
@entity58 and @entity78 have been developing an under - suit that compresses the body to overcome the negative effects of a reduction in pressure and gravity			2
however , biological adaption could be made easier if microgravity were avoided altogether			0
the spacecraft could be spun in - transit to generate an artificial gravity that slowly decayed , simulating a transition from @entity29 to @entity5 gravity ( and vice versa ) over the six - month journey			1
ultimately , until humans are actually living on other planets it 's unlikely we 'll solve or even recognise all the subtle long - term health problems associated with reduced gravity			1
and who 's to say what the advances in bio-engineering and technology will make the human body capable of when that time comes ? @entity244 : if there 's life on @entity5 , even if it 's microbial , should we be allowed to spread to the planet , potentially risking its extinction ? i find this question strange -- as @entity252 put it : " we commit microbial genocide every time we wash our hands "			2
we engineer and farm the complex life around us as systematically and as cheaply as possible			0
billions of people eat the carcasses of organisms that were thinking and breathing only days before			0
why , all of a sudden , should @entity5 microbes be given such sanctity ? it should certainly be studied , but it should n't prevent our spreading			2
back contamination : conversely , the question of whether some @entity5 plague might accidentally be introduced to @entity29 should be taken seriously -- but not blown out of proportion			2
there 's only a remote chance that @entity5 life might be hazardous			2
the things that kill us do so because they 've evolved in lock - step with us in a continual evolutionary arms race			0
any @entity5 life will have evolved independently and is unlikely to be capable even of interacting with @entity29 life on a molecular level			2
as @entity284 put it : " trees do n't get colds and humans do n't get @entity283			0
" psychology : depending on relative orbits , sending a message between @entity29 and @entity5 can take between three and 22 minutes			2
this loss of real - time communication will leave astronauts feeling cut - off and alone			0
@entity16 says that it 's vital to keep up crew morale and motivation : " once you get any distance away on any sort of voyage , the epic - ness disappears , the reality becomes the foreground , and the applause is long gone			2
" cost : a crewed @entity5 program would cost the equivalent of a few weeks of the @entity47 defense budget			1
the @entity47 plans on spending about 10 times more on nuclear weapons than on space exploration over the coming decade			0
the @entity309 government spends about as much on gastric band surgery through the @entity311 as it does on its space activities			0
so while a @entity5 program certainly has challenges to overcome , the technological gap between us and @entity5 is far smaller than it was for the @entity66 program in the 1960s			1
and the prospects the @entity320 holds for humanity are far greater			0

pursuing " green " initiatives is no long - term solution to the wall we 're hurtling towards , says @entity329
@entity329 : *launching* missions to @entity5 would use less energy than those to the @entity66
@entity5 program certainly has challenges to overcome , but technological gap between us and @entity5 is smaller than it was for the @entity66 program in 1960s , he adds
