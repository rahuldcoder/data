-- @entity1 will cement his position as the most bankable boxer in the world in saturday night 's non-title welterweight fight against fellow @entity7 @entity6 in @entity8			1
the 33 - year - old , whose nicknames include " money , " has already generated $ 292 million in revenue in six pay - per - view fights for broadcaster @entity14 , from 5.5 million buys			1
he is expected to take home $ 58.5 million for himself if the battle with veteran @entity6 achieves two million subscribers			2
@entity1 is already fourth on the broadcaster 's all - time list behind @entity21 ( $ 610.6 million on 12.6 million buys from 18 events ) , @entity24 ( $ 545 million on 12.4 million buys , 12 bouts ) and @entity27 ( $ 543 million on 12.6 million buys , 14 fights )			1
@entity21 and @entity24 have both retired , while the 47 - year - old @entity27 last month kept alive his unlikely dream of winning the world heavyweight title for a record fifth time by claiming the little - regarded @entity35 crown in front of just 3,000 people in @entity8			1
@entity1 's 2007 victory over @entity21 earned a record $ 120 million for a single pay - per - view event from 2.15 million buys , and @entity14 told @entity0 that his fight with the 38 - year - old @entity6 is set to qualify as a true " megafight			1
" " in boxing , megafights are those that reach one million buys , " @entity44 senior vice-president @entity43 said			0
" by every indicator -- ticket sales , closed circuit television sales , views of video on the @entity54 , and the number of viewers of @entity14 's 24/7 series -- @entity1 - @entity6 is on track to becoming a true @entity60 megafight			1
" whether on television , radio , newspapers , magazines , @entity54 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity14 , or at retail stores across the country , fans everywhere are surrounded by this great event			0
the @entity1 - @entity6 buzz is everywhere			2
" @entity1 is undefeated in 40 fights , and has won six world titles at five different weights			2
however , he has lost his no. 1 ranking as the highly - regarded @entity80 's world 's top pound - for - pound boxer to rival @entity81			0
the two were due to clash earlier this year but the @entity83 pulled out due to @entity1 's demands for @entity86 - style blood - testing			1
" @entity1 is a bonafide ppv superstar , " @entity43 said			0
" he is one of most prolific performers in ppv history			0
" but it takes two to make a true megafight and , like @entity1 , @entity6 is a future hall - of - famer and one of the most recognizable boxing stars of this era			1
@entity6 is a critical ingredient in the megafight status of @entity97			0
" while @entity6 and @entity1 definitely have very passionate fan bases in their hometowns [ @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , @entity103 respectively ] , both @entity1 and @entity6 are national figures with broad and diverse fan bases throughout the entire @entity7 " as the ' who @entity108 ? ' polls indicate , fans everywhere are talking about this matchup and it is virtually a 50 - 50 split as to who the fans think will win			2
" while many pundits expect @entity1 and @entity81 to agree to fight by the end of this year , the @entity7 has taunted the @entity83 by saying he is not enough of a box office draw			2
@entity81 's fights with @entity21 and @entity119 brought in significantly fewer buys than @entity1 's clashes with the duo			1
" he needs to learn how to do numbers like i 'm doing , " @entity1 , who shunned the chance of winning the @entity125 belt against @entity6 as he did not want to pay the sanctioning fees , told @entity127			1
" he needs to step his game up			0
i 'm not worried about this [ @entity6 fight ]			0
i know i 'm going to do crazy numbers			0
i should walk away with about $ 40 million			0
with or without @entity81 i 'm going to be able to go out and make $ 20 million or $ 30 million a night			0

@entity1 is fourth in all - time list of revenue earners in pay - per - view fights
saturday 's non-title fight with @entity6 will push him past $ *300* million mark
@entity1 's 2007 win over @entity21 most *lucrative* event in boxing history
the 33 - year - old opted out of title fight as he did not want to pay @entity125 sanctioning fee
