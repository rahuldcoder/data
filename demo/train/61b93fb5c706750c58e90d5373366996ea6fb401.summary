@entity0 , @entity1 -- they are the first victims of the oil disaster that has devastated the @entity6 region : 11 oil rig workers killed on april 20 when the @entity9 drilling rig exploded , torching the sky and puncturing the sea			1
their remains have been lost in the @entity6			1
at least 15 others were injured in the massive explosion			0
victims and their families are suing @entity17 and @entity18 , the @entity20 - based company that owns the drilling rig			1
but getting a settlement from @entity18 , the world 's largest offshore drilling company , could be difficult			1
q&a on the legal liability of the companies involved in the oil disaster the company has invoked a 19th century @entity30 law to limit its liability to $ 26.76 million , a fraction of what the plaintiffs are likely to seek			1
" it may work , " said @entity35 , professor of law and director of @entity38 's @entity37			2
" they 've got a chance			0
" @entity18 's pre-emptive strike is part of the legal thicket confronting victims , where a patchwork of arcane and sometimes inconsistent laws will most likely make the ensuing litigation one of the most complex cases in @entity30 history			1
the @entity9 is technically a mobile offshore drilling unit			1
under maritime law , it is classified as a seagoing vessel , just like a freighter or passenger ship			2
three weeks after the accident , @entity18 petitioned a @entity30 federal court for protection under the @entity60 of 1851			1
@entity61 enacted the law to spur investment in shipping and keep the @entity66 fleet competitive with other seafaring nations			1
to help the @entity30 shipping industry , the government limited ship owners ' liability to the value of the vessel plus the money the owner would collect for completing its voyage			2
but now that the @entity9 is a wreck on the ocean floor , the vessel is worthless , according to @entity18			1
read the affidavit stating @entity9 's value is " $ 0.00 dollars " @entity18 says the remaining value of its drilling contract with @entity17 at the time of the april 20 disaster was $ 26,764,083			1
that amount , the company argues , is the maximum it is legally required to pay to victims			0
" totally ridiculous , " said @entity91 , a @entity93 , @entity92 , attorney representing two of the victims			0
@entity18 's ability to use the law may depend on a judge 's ruling on who at @entity18 knew of potential problems and when they knew it			1
much of the focus has been on @entity17 and its liability in the @entity6 oil catastrophe			1
survivors of the explosion told @entity2 's @entity108 in an exclusive interview that a @entity17 official wanted workers to replace heavy mud -- used to keep the well 's pressure down -- with lighter seawater to help speed a process that was costing an estimated $ 750,000 a day and was already running five weeks late			1
more on the survivors ' account in the claims against @entity18 , its lawyers will try to prove that @entity18 's top managers did not know about conditions that would cause the accident			2
if they succeed , the @entity60 will apply			2
lawyers for the victims will argue that @entity18 officials had enough of what the 1851 law calls " privity or knowledge " to hold the company responsible for the full value of the death and injury claims			1
publicly , the victims ' lawyers say they are confident they can " break the limit			0
" but law professor @entity35 disagreed : " it 's not a slam dunk			0
" if @entity18 prevails , a relatively small pool of money would be split among the victims			2
if the money ends up being shared on a pro-rated formula , " nobody 's getting paid 100 percent , " said @entity146 , a plaintiff 's lawyer in @entity148 , @entity149			0
smaller payouts also affect lawyers who work on contingency fees			0
the less they recover for their clients , the less the lawyers get paid			0
read how some lawyers could get a huge payout a @entity18 press release states , without elaboration , that " @entity18 will honor all of its legal obligations arising from the @entity9 accident			1
" the company said the petition seeking shelter under the @entity60 was filed " at the instruction of its insurers and in order to preserve insurance coverage			2
" " it 's understandable self protection , " @entity35 said , " but it still has an unsavory feel to it			0
" especially , he added , since the proposed limit is a " far smaller amount than what they 've recovered from their insurers			0
" @entity18 carried $ 560 million in insurance on the @entity9 -- more than its book value , according to company officials			1
@entity18 noted a $ 270 million " accounting gain " -- or profit -- from the insurance payout in a may 6 conference call with investors			2
another point of contention is where any future legal battle takes place			0
@entity18 argues that @entity93 is the proper venue , because its @entity30 headquarters is there			1
but lawyers for the victims want to move the case to @entity148 , which they argue is more convenient for their clients and closer to the scene of the disaster			0
the lawyers are competing for the " subterranean sympathy you can get from a judge , " @entity35 said			0
judges " are all supposed to be objective , but the @entity148 judges are likely to be more ticked off about it than in @entity93 , " he said			0
critics , including @entity35 , say the @entity60 is anachronistic and " no longer serving the purpose that it was intended to serve			2
" it should be amended , said attorney @entity210 , who represents victims			0
" the law ought to just deal with cargo at this point , " not personal injury and wrongful death claims , he told @entity2			0
sen. @entity217 , @entity219 - @entity218 , said the law should be repealed , " so that no company has the opportunity to walk away from its responsibility			2
" but if the law is so antiquated , why was n't it changed years ago ? " you ca n't get @entity61 to pay attention to anything on maritime law , " @entity35 said			0
" it 's not a very sexy issue until there 's a disaster			0

families of oil workers killed , hurt in @entity6 file lawsuits against @entity17 , @entity18
@entity18 , which owns @entity9 , to use a 19th century @entity30 law
the @entity60 was meant to keep @entity30 @entity241 competitive
some *lawmakers* and *analysts* say the law should either be amended or repealed
