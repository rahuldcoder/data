-- are we there yet ? if you 're @entity5 and you 're looking for a spot beyond the end of our solar system , the answer is no. @entity11 officials have been saying for months that @entity5 is almost there when it comes to interstellar space as it continues the longest road trip in the history of mankind			1
@entity5 and @entity18 took off 16 days apart in 1977 , and @entity5 is now about 11 billion miles ( 18 billion kilometers ) from the sun. on monday , project officials said new information sent back from the ship yielded a surprising result			1
" if we would have only looked at particle data alone , we would have said we 're out of the solar system , " said @entity24 , a scientist from @entity25 who examines data on low - energy charged particles			2
" but nature is very imaginative , and @entity32 pulled up the football again			0
" the voyager team believes this region is where lines of magnetic particles from the solar system are meeting particles from interstellar space			2
because the direction of the magnetic lines is unchanged , the project members count this as part of the solar system			2
when the direction changes , @entity5 will finally be in interstellar space			0
" we believe this is the last leg of our journey to interstellar space , " said project member @entity50 of the @entity51			0
" our best guess is it 's likely just a few months to a couple years away			0
the new region is n't what we expected , but we 've come to expect the unexpected from @entity5			0
" the spacecraft entered the new region in july , fueling predictions it was getting close to the edge of the solar system			1
@entity18 , which is on a different flight path , is a few billion miles closer to the sun. read more space and science news on @entity0 's @entity69			1

@entity5 is about 11 billion miles from the sun and was *launched* in 1977
@entity5 finds new region of solar system , rather than the edge as scientists had predicted
@entity18 is about 9 billion miles from the sun on a different flight path
