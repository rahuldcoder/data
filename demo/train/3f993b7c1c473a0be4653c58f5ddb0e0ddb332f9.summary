-- as an @entity2 , i am appalled by @entity3 and his relentless , pathetic and ultimately doomed effort to revise the history of his failures			1
but as a @entity7 , i am thrilled that an incompetent , dishonest and reviled figure is hell - bent on making himself the face of the @entity11 , hogging the spotlight from rising stars like @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 -- and eclipsing more honorable republicans from the @entity19 era , like @entity20			0
@entity3 's endless media appearances , including this remarkable interview with @entity0 's @entity23 , reveal a nearly sociopathic refusal to admit any error , express any remorse , apologize for any mistake			1
and so let us review the @entity3 record : no vice president has done more damage to our country , not even vice president @entity33 , who shot and killed @entity34 210 years ago			1
in the first months of the @entity19 - @entity3 administration , @entity3 was ordered to convene a task force on terrorism			1
instead , he ignored the problem , the @entity3 terror task force never met , and the warnings about an impending terrorist attack were ignored			1
later , instead of apologizing , @entity3 cravenly blamed the @entity44 counterterrorism czar ( @entity45 ) , @entity46 , who had tried to warn anyone who would listen that an attack was coming			1
" @entity50 was the head of the counterterrorism program in the run up to 9/11 , " @entity3 said			1
" he obviously missed it			0
" blaming the guy who did his job when you 're the one who did n't do yours			0
from there , it was off to the races , as @entity3 did and said anything to drag @entity2 into a war with @entity65			1
the good folks at @entity67 have compiled a damning indictment of @entity3 's deep dishonesty about @entity65			1
in the interest of brevity , let me focus on a few lowlights : he said the lead 9/11 hijacker " did go to @entity75 , and he did meet with a senior official of the @entity65 intelligence service ... several months before the attack			1
" wrong , according to a @entity82 report			0
he said @entity83 had " an established relationship with @entity85			0
" wrong ( @entity45 )			0
@entity3 claimed there was " irrefutable evidence " @entity83 had reconstituted his nuclear program			1
he said @entity83 " had an established relationship with @entity85 , providing training to @entity85 members in areas of poisons , gases and conventional bombs			0
" wrong ( @entity45 )			0
he said there was " overwhelming " evidence of ties between @entity85 and @entity65			2
he said that we 'd be " greeted as liberators " and that the insurgency was in its " last throes " nine years ago			0
and that 's just on @entity65			2
need i mention that , as ceo of @entity106 , @entity3 opposed president @entity108 's sanctions on the terrorist regime in @entity110 , calling the @entity108 administration " sanctions - happy " ? and he breezily defended doing business with the terrorists in @entity115 -- through an overseas - based subsidiary -- explaining that " the good @entity117 did n't see fit to always put oil and gas resources where there are democratic governments			1
" need i mention he told treasury secretary @entity123 that " deficits do n't matter " ? one can debate whether @entity3 's misstatements were the result of willful mendacity or incompetence			1
but at a deeper level , it does not matter			0
regardless of whether @entity3 is a liar or a fool , thousands of heroic @entity2 troops are dead			1
tens of thousands are injured			0
@entity65 is a disaster -- and will be for years to come			1
and @entity2 is weaker and poorer because of @entity3			1
i know that powerful people do n't like admitting error			2
but @entity141 did so in her new book , candidly admitting that in voting for the @entity19 - @entity3 war in @entity65 , " i got it wrong			1
" @entity3 , however , has no room for such candid introspection			2
when he turned 70 , he was asked his greatest regret			0
he did not mention the death and devastation he brought to @entity65 or that he and others ignored the terror threat before 9/11			2
he did n't mention his votes in @entity153 against banning plastic guns or opposing the release of @entity156			0
he said , " my misspent youth			0
a three - word oblique reference to a couple of drunken driving incidents a half century ago are the biggest regrets of this man 's life			0
other than that , @entity3 sees his life as a flawless , virtuous existence			2
were it not for the tragedies of 9/11 and @entity65 , perhaps the thing @entity3 would be remembered for was that he was the second vice president to shoot a man , albeit @entity3 's was in a hunting accident and @entity172 , thank @entity173 , survived			1
still , as a longtime quail hunter , i have no doubt @entity3 was in the wrong			2
every hunter is responsible for knowing where his buddies are			0
and @entity3 violated a cardinal rule : he was drinking before he picked up the gun			2
( he claims to have had only one beer , but even one is too many when you 're hunting			0
) but here 's the thing : even after @entity3 shot him in the face , there 's no indication he ever apologized to @entity172			2
i suppose being a sociopath means never having to say you 're sorry			0
correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly indicated an affiliation between the @entity198 and the independent news website @entity67 .			0

@entity201 says he is appalled by @entity3 and his relentless effort to revise history
@entity205 : @entity3 wo n't admit any error , *misgiving* or remorse or apologize for any mistake
@entity205 : @entity3 misled , lied and did anything to drag @entity2 into a war with @entity65
he says whether @entity3 is a liar or fool ; thousands of troops are dead ; @entity65 is a disaster
