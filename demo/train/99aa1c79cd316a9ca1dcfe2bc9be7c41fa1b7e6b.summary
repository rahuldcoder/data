" we 're a city that believes in freedom , and we 've always believed in freedom and free expression , " @entity16 told @entity22			1
" but taking your pants off at @entity31 and displaying your genitals to everyone , that 's not free expression			1
" but some nudists have filed a lawsuit claiming the ban violates their first amendment rights			1
" is the @entity39 more powerful and more important than the passions of an intolerant mob and the ambitions of one or more city supervisors ? we would contend that it is , and that 's what our case is based upon , " the nudists ' attorney , @entity44 , told @entity22			2
the ban does not apply at " permitted parades , fairs and festivals			1
