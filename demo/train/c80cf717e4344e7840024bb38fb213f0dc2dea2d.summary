after @entity1 graduated from fashion design school in 2007 , she landed four jobs as an apparel designer for @entity6 brands			1
the first three jobs , she quit			0
at her last job , she was fired			0
@entity1 's career problems stem largely from the fact that she says her bosses encouraged her to more or less copy international designs rather than to create her own			1
management perceived anything too unique to be too much of a business risk : as @entity6 consumer tastes still tilt overwhelmingly towards the mainstream , anything off - kilter simply may not sell			1
" they just want to copy from the other brands , " the 26 - year - old said			0
" they are scared of the creative			0
" now @entity1 says she does not know what to do			0
chances of working for an international brand seem slim			0
she would like to launch her own label , yet funding for independent fashion lines is hard to come by and there 's no guarantee the country 's brand conscious consumers will buy anything without a famous international label printed ostentatiously on a shirt , bag or other piece of clothing			1
" designers always want to follow their own hearts , " @entity1 said			1
" but they have to consider the market needs			0
" no doubt @entity47 's once almost non-existent fashion industry is on the verge of exploding			1
new domestic brands pop up seemingly everyday			0
@entity6 models , like @entity52 , who has shot campaigns with @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , are increasingly becoming a hot commodity on foreign runways while domestic designers , such as @entity60 , who debuted mainstream @entity62 menswear brand at the @entity63 this week in @entity64 , are piquing the interest of the international fashion elite			1
but for grassroots designers , the fashion landscape is still largely difficult			1
aside from money , independent designers say they struggle with coming up with original concepts that represent modern @entity6 style			1
" in order to establish a foundation , it is important to slow down and look back , " @entity73 , who founded her womenswear brand @entity74 with only 40,000 yuan ( about $ 6,000 ) in @entity76 in 2003 , said			0
" the problem is every time they [ designers ] stop and look back , they resort to the period of the @entity86 's style			1
" the style during the @entity86 , a period between 1966 and 1976 when millions lost their lives in the midst of political violence , was overtly drab			2
men and women wore dark colored clothing			0
anything remotely stylish was banished as art , music and intellectual endeavors were perceived as bourgeois and thus a threat to the @entity102			0
a @entity86 aesthetic , so to speak , has had a resurgence in @entity47 in the form of kitschy t - shirts , bags and caps , which can be found in a number of artsy boutiques in @entity76 , @entity111 and elsewhere			1
however @entity73 points out that over the past half - century , after @entity47 reopened its doors to the rest of the world in 1978 , all other influences have been predominantly from the @entity116			1
the archives of ancient @entity47 must be opened to find new inspiration , the designer said			1
she points to @entity121 designer @entity120 , whose avante - garde clothes draw influence from dynastic times , as an inspiration : " he is very successful , " she said			0
" but that should be the work @entity6 designers do , and yet we can not surpass him			1
" @entity132 , founder of the @entity134 womenswear brand , is one domestic designer who is trying to slow down and look way back to the country 's deeply rich history for inspiration			2
it has not been easy			0
before starting her own fashion label in 2008 , @entity139 said she sat at home " totally depressed			2
" " there was a huge gap between my ideal and the practice and the work			0
i lost my orientation in the business , " she said , adding that the market , especially younger segments , cared only about fast fashion rather than fashion as an art form that reinvigorated cultural beauty from the past			2
now with no store , no employees , little money and a studio located in an apartment building amidst farmland outside of @entity76 , @entity139 is struggling to survive			0
during a good month , she sells maybe around half a dozen of her pieces , which feature flowing swaths of silk and chiffon meant to mimic calligraphy or attire worn by scholars during the @entity173			0
" there are many designers who want to do things quickly , " she said			2
" from my perspective , it is important to have a certain amount of time to accumulate your style			2
" the situation is not so bleak for everyone , especially those who have turned to the internet , specifically @entity187 , the country 's largest e-commerce platform which is home to countless grassroots stores selling everything from wrenches to iphones			1
around three years ago , @entity195 launched her wing free brand on the shopping site			0
@entity200 to @entity201 or @entity202 , @entity195 's vintage - inspired designs are hip and chic , targeting teenagers and twenty - somethings			2
she sells up to 300 pieces of her clothing per day			0
she is optimistic about her future but tempered on the overall future of homegrown design			0
" for those who are really talented , they should just go abroad and they will be recognized , " @entity195 said			0
" here , the industry is more based on contacts , relationships and publicity			2
it is a bit like an illusion			0
" there are some who are trying to support the local industry , especially those whose designs are more haute couture than high street hip			2
in @entity111 , for example , @entity229 , a tv host known as the " @entity230 , " has opened a boutique called @entity47 , or @entity233			1
the store features work from select @entity6 labels			1
it 's neighbors include famous foreign brands such as @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241			2
@entity6 celebrities are also helping to drum up demand for homegrown style , according to @entity245 , an advisor to the @entity246 , which publishes a number of newspapers and magazines			1
actress @entity250 wowed global audiences at this year 's @entity252 when she wore a stunning red gown embroidered with white cranes from up - and - coming domestic designer @entity255			2
the celebrities " want to represent @entity47 , " @entity256 said			1
" the whole black tie and @entity259 style is not the @entity6 tradition at all , that is why i see there is a market for @entity47 to have local designers who know the flavor of the @entity6			1
but whether this will become a big market in @entity47 or not , i do n't know			1
i can only say it is possible			0

@entity47 's fashion industry is *expanding* at a rapid pace
but for grassroots designers the landscape remains largely difficult
many say they struggle to create original concepts that embody modern @entity6 style
