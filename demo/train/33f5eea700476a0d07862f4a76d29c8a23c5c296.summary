-- do you ever get sick of your phone ringing ? what about @entity5 fatigue ? does @entity6 sometimes give you stress headaches , making you occasionally wish you could just yank the plug on your online life ? do you get nervous when your smart phone rings ? a report says you 're not alone			0
well , you 're not alone , according to a recent report from the @entity15 , a nonprofit research group in @entity16			1
the report , written by @entity18 , the project 's associate director of research , says 7 percent of @entity21 use the internet as their primary means of social communication and also feel conflicted about that fact			1
these online social network users , which @entity18 calls " ambivalent networkers , " are so connected they feel like they ca n't quit			2
but @entity18 , who counts himself among this group , says there is hope for these conflicted @entity31 a quiz to find out what kind of tech user you are " i do think it 's a matter of society and individuals in society understanding these tools			1
so tools can be used for good and tools can be used for ill as well			0
they can have negative impacts , " he said			0
@entity0 spoke with @entity18 by phone about the various ways people are using cell phones and the @entity22 today , including the 14 percent of people who use neither			1
the following is an edited version of that conversation : @entity0 : tell me about the report			2
@entity18 : we recently produced a report called " the @entity59 , " which places @entity21 adults into 10 different user types , depending on how they feel about information technology , what kind of information technology they have in their lives and how they use information technology in their lives			1
@entity0 : you give the names for these categories some fun titles			2
tell me more about what we know about these groups of people			0
@entity18 : the most high - tech group we labeled the " digital collaborators			1
" the digital collaborators are the ones with the most technology , doing the most with it and loving it the most , and really are about not just using technology to communicate with others but to cultivate their creative lives			0
another is the " ambivalent networkers , " which is a fun group in that they 're the youngest of any group ... they 're the most active in using mobile devices for a range of different purposes , yet , at the same time they express fairly high levels of concern about always being available to others			2
@entity0 : i find that group interesting			1
what 's behind that conflicted sentiment ? @entity18 : there 's a sense that it might be costly for them not to be on the network			0
so if you think of that group of " ambivalent networkers " as being a youthful group , all of whom have cell phones , probably the very majority of their social networks are online			1
they 're always texting or communicating or e-mailing to keep in touch and make plans			0
so if you 're in a social milieu like that and you want a break , you may feel like going off the grid would be a bad thing , because you wo n't know what your friends are up to , you wo n't know what the plan is for saturday evening , or you might worry that your friends will be worried if you 're not instantly responsive to their queries			2
@entity0 : do you have a sense whether those negative feelings are a growing trend , or if people are becoming more mobile and on the whole are liking it ? @entity18 : what i think the message is with all these new tools -- @entity6 , for instance -- is that @entity6 is a great way to put yourself out there			1
it also could be a tool for managing your connectivity			0
you might start to use your @entity5 page or your @entity6 account as a means to say , " hey guys , i 'm shutting down for a while , so do n't worry about me if i do n't respond to you immediately			0
" so i think a challenge for people going forward is to see these tools as tools , meaning you can use them to identify yourself as being offline at a particular moment , and not see them as perpetual obligations to be available at all times to all people			0
@entity0 : have you heard of any interesting ways people might be dealing with that ? @entity18 : i think it 's fairly well known in the tech community that traffic for blogs and so - forth dives on the weekends , so i think people tend to use the weekends as a way to take a little bit of a breather			1
@entity0 : the people who are off the network entirely , do you have a sense if that population is growing , or if those people will eventually end up on the network ? @entity18 : the off - network share of @entity21 was approximately the same in 2008 as it was in 2006 , when we looked at it before			1
i think that will shrink over time as people become more dependent on the cell phone , which we do see as a rising trend			1
people who are off the network tend to be older and lower income			0
i think as time marches on you 'll see technology that 's tailored more towards older @entity21			2
so we can expect that [ group ] to shrink over time , but maybe not at a tremendously rapid rate			0
@entity0 : if you were to pick one of these groups , which would you fall into ? @entity18 : i took the test and i was an " ambivalent networker			0
" i answered on the quiz that i sometimes do n't get all too charged up when that cell phone rings or vibrates			1
so i 'm someone who does like to have a bit of a break from the internet from time to time or with cell phone availability			2
and i kind of struggle with that occasionally			0
@entity0 : how do you handle that ? @entity18 : it 's a matter of self - discipline : turning the cell phone off from time to time and spending , when i can , part of the workday not in front of the computer .			1
