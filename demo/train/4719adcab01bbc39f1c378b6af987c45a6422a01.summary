-- the latest controversy over whether @entity2 has the technology to fit a nuclear warhead on a missile is not the first time @entity8 intelligence agencies have been at odds in assessing @entity11 's capabilities			1
and it is not the first time the @entity15 's intelligence arm , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) has been out front in reaching the most alarmist conclusions about @entity2 -- one with which other @entity8 agencies have disagreed			1
the @entity16 assessment , disclosed by a congressman at a hearing on april 11 , was that the @entity16 has " moderate confidence " @entity2 has developed a nuclear warhead that can be delivered by a ballistic missile			1
within hours , however , @entity26 , director of national intelligence , released a statement saying the @entity16 report did not represent the consensus of the intelligence community , and that " @entity2 has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile , " -- a view echoed by a @entity15 spokesman and the @entity37			1
secretary of state @entity38 also noted that " it is inaccurate to suggest that the @entity2 has fully tested , developed or demonstrated capabilities that are articulated in that report			1
" read more : @entity38 visits @entity43 amid @entity2 's nuclear threats the sharply different judgments about @entity11 's capabilities recall a similar episode in 1998 , when a fierce debate erupted within the @entity8 intelligence community after @entity8 spy satellites discovered an underground complex at @entity52 , not far from @entity2 's main nuclear facility at @entity54			1
the @entity16 insisted that @entity55 was a construction site for a secret , underground nuclear weapons facility and that its existence proved @entity11 was cheating on the @entity59 , the @entity61 administration 's 1994 deal under which the @entity62 froze operations at @entity54 in return for economic and diplomatic concessions from @entity66			2
" the @entity16 was adamant , " then - national security adviser @entity67 recalled in a 2007 interview for my book , " meltdown : the @entity72 of the @entity73			0
" " they said they could see the roads that were characteristic of this kind of facility , they could actually see that this hole was perfectly suited for a nuclear reactor , " he said			0
other intelligence agencies at the time , including the @entity84 , were more skeptical			1
" i looked at the evidence , " one senior @entity61 administration official told me during research for my book , " and i could easily see innocent explanations for virtually everything they pointed to			0
and others in the intel community looked at exactly the same stuff and heard the @entity16 's arguments about it , and said essentially , this is really flimsy stuff			2
" on august 17 , 1998 , the @entity97 published a story that revealed the intelligence findings , turning what had been an internal intelligence debate into a public firestorm of controversy -- just as the congressman 's revelations did on thursday			0
the @entity97 report , with headline " @entity108 , @entity110 " created major problems			0
in @entity66 , the @entity61 administration came under attack for @entity11 's alleged violations of the @entity59			0
and , unless the issue was handled with great skill , the tenuous link between the @entity8 and @entity2 that has existed since the 1994 deal would collapse			1
in the spring of 1999 , @entity118 , @entity66 's @entity119 with @entity2 -- nicknamed " @entity128 " for his ability to sit patiently and listen to @entity2 envoys spew out venom , bombast and threats across the negotiating table -- engaged in protracted talks with his @entity2 counterparts			1
in may , @entity118 convinced the @entity62 to agree to permit @entity8 inspectors to visit @entity52			1
in addition , after initially demanding a payment of $ 300 million dollars for a one - time visit , @entity2 eventually accepted a shipment of 100,000 tons of potatoes as the " price " of permitting the inspection			1
accompanied by a team of experts , @entity118 flew to @entity11 and the @entity2 took them to @entity52			1
to the @entity8 ' surprise and embarrassment , they found a large , empty underground cave			1
there was no evidence of a secret nuclear site			0
according to @entity150 , then the @entity149 's senior director for non-proliferation and subsequently president @entity153 's coordinator for @entity154 , counter-terrorism and arms control : " the conclusion was that @entity55 was not configured in a way that could be used either for plutonium or for enrichment			2
so , whatever we thought @entity162 was , it was n't			0
it was not nuclear - related			0
" nearly two decades later , the purpose of the construction site at @entity52 remains unknown			0
but the episode underscores the complexities of assessing intelligence on @entity2			2
the rush to judgment in 1998 , driven by the @entity16 's aggressive briefings and the deliberate leak of the story to the media , left many officials at the time cautious , if not downright skeptical , about subsequent intelligence findings			2
" @entity16 hyped their findings unbelievably , " one former senior @entity61 administration official said to me			0
" they mis - stated their level of certainty , and the further up the food chain they went , the more they dropped the caveats , and ended up putting us in a terrible position			0
" @entity150 had accepted the @entity16 's analysis , and lobbied strongly for the @entity61 administration to make @entity195 a major issue			0
" @entity67 [ president @entity61 's @entity196 ] depended pretty heavily on my judgment , " he told me , " and i feel that my recommendation to him that it was a serious issue led the administration to deal with it more seriously than it ever turns out is justified			0
i would say that was the biggest mistake i made in my career as a civil servant			0
" the @entity195 episode does not mean the @entity16 is necessarily wrong in its current assessment of @entity2 nuclear capabilities			2
but the skepticism expressed by other agencies after thursday 's revelation carries a lesson			2
in a country which the former deputy head of the @entity84 , @entity211 , once described to me as an " intelligence black hole , " serious analysts can reach sharply differing conclusions about the same evidence , and the public should be careful in taking every alarmist headline about @entity2 at face value			1

@entity2 has *unleashed* a torrent of *dramatic* threats against the @entity8 and @entity43
the @entity8 calculates that a test launch of *mobile* ballistic missiles could come at any time
@entity233 says it 's not the first time such an " alarmist " conclusion has been reached
he suggests other @entity8 agencies have disagreed
