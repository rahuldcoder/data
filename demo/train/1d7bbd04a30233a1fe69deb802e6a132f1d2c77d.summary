-- in sweeping discipline that one analyst called " historic , " @entity4 head coach @entity3 was suspended without pay for the entire 2012 season and former @entity4 defensive coach @entity7 was suspended indefinitely in a series of @entity9 punishments wednesday for the team 's bounty program targeting opponents			1
under the bounties , the team paid bonuses for knocking opposing players out of a game , the @entity9 said			1
@entity4 general manager @entity18 was suspended without pay for the first eight regular - season games of the 2012 season , the @entity9 said			1
assistant head coach @entity23 was suspended without pay for the first six regular - season games , the league said			1
the team was also fined $ 500,000 and will forfeit its second - round draft picks in 2012 and 2013 , the @entity9 said			2
the club issued a statement apologizing and taking full responsibility for " these serious violations			0
" " we recognize our fans ' concerns and we regret the uncertainty this episode has created for them , " the @entity4 ' statement said			1
" we are humbled by the support our organization has received from our fans today in the wake of this announcement , and we ask them to continue to stand with us , as they have done in the past , when both our team and our city have overcome greater adversities			2
" there is no place for bounties in our league and we reiterate our pledge that this will never happen again , " the team said			1
@entity9 commissioner @entity53 will review the status of @entity7 , now with the @entity55 , at the end of the season and decide whether to reinstate him , the league said			1
@entity7 apologized " wholeheartedly " in a statement and said his leadership role in the bounty program was " not a true reflection of my values as a father or coach			1
" " i highly value the 23 years that i 've spent in the @entity9			0
i will continue to cooperate fully with the league and its investigation and i will focus my energies on serving as an advocate for both player safety and sportsmanship , " @entity7 said			1
" i will do everything possible to re-earn the respect of my colleagues , the @entity9 and its players in hopes of returning to coaching in the future			0
" in issuing the punishments , @entity53 described the @entity4 ' violations of league rules " particularly unusual and egregious			1
" he added that " a strong and lasting message must be sent			0
" @entity53 said he is reviewing with the @entity83 discipline for players involved in the bounty program and will address the matter later			0
one sports analyst , @entity87 of @entity88 , said the discipline is " historic			0
" " one of the reasons they could be so strong against the @entity4 was that there was a paper trail , " @entity87 said , referring to e-mails			1
" i do n't think other teams would be dumb enough to put it in writing , " @entity87 said of the bounty system			2
" i definitely believe they are trying to make an example of them			0
" the @entity9 already is facing class - action lawsuits from former players of various teams who claimed that league play led to concussions , head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a dementia - like brain disease			2
" the league has to be concerned about lawsuits , " @entity87 said			0
the @entity9 investigation found the @entity4 had an " active bounty program " during the 2009 , 2010 and 2011 seasons in which " bounty " payments were given for " knock - outs " and " cart - offs " : plays in which an opposing player had to leave the game , the league said in a statement			1
the bounties even identified specific players as targets , the league said			0
the investigation found that the @entity4 showed " a deliberate effort to conceal the program 's existence from league investigators , and a clear determination to maintain the program despite express direction from @entity4 ownership that it stop as well as ongoing inquiries from the league office , " the @entity9 said			1
the @entity4 won the @entity139 in 2010 , in the midst of the bounty program			1
@entity53 said the " pay - for - performance " program " undermined the integrity of the game			0
" the league found that @entity3 , as head coach , failed to supervise players and coaches , did n't inquire into the facts of the bounty program though he was aware of the league 's inquiries , and encouraged " the false denials by instructing assistants to ' make sure our ducks are in a row , ' " the @entity9 statement said			1
@entity53 added : " when there is targeting of players for injury and cash rewards over a three - year period , the involvement of the coaching staff , and three years of denials and willful disrespect of the rules , a strong and lasting message must be sent that such conduct is totally unacceptable and has no place in the game			0
" beyond the clear and continuing violations of league rules , and lying to investigators , the bounty program is squarely contrary to the league 's most important initiatives -- enhancing player health and safety and protecting the integrity of the game , " the commissioner continued			0
" let me be clear			0
there is no place in the @entity9 for deliberately seeking to injure another player , let alone offering a reward for doing so , " @entity53 said			0
on his @entity189 account , @entity4 quarterback @entity187 wrote : " i am speechless			1
@entity3 is a great man , coach , and mentor			0
i need to hear an explanation for this punishment			0
" saints starting linebacker @entity196 also tweeted : " can we all say # excessive			0
" at a news conference wednesday afternoon , @entity55 head coach @entity197 said that the indefinite suspension of his defensive coordinator , @entity7 , did n't come as " a complete surprise			1
" but he said @entity7 was " surprised and shocked			2
" @entity197 said the @entity55 had no idea when they hired @entity7 " that this would happen			1
" " he made a mistake , and he admitted to that mistake , and he 's remorseful , and he regrets the decision he has made , and he has accepted the consequences , " @entity197 said of @entity7			2
on wednesday , the @entity9 laid out a narrative of the @entity4 ' bounty program			2
players regularly made cash " donations " to a pool and were " fined " for mental errors , loafing and penalties , the @entity9 investigation found			0
at least one assistant coach , @entity7 , also occasionally contributed to the pool , but the @entity9 found no evidence that any team money went to the fund			1
payments were made for plays in which opposing players were injured and for interceptions and fumble recoveries , the @entity9 said			0
" the investigation showed bounties being placed on four quarterbacks of opposing teams -- ( @entity233 's ) @entity232 , ( @entity235 's ) @entity234 , ( @entity237 's ) @entity236 , and ( @entity239 's ) @entity238 , " the @entity9 said			1
@entity232 and @entity238 have since retired			2
several players pledged money for bounties on specific opponents , " with defensive captain @entity244 offering $ 10,000 to any player who knocked @entity232 out of the @entity246 in 2010 , " the @entity9 said			0
in the three seasons of the bounty program , the @entity4 were among the top five teams in roughing - the - passer penalties and ranked in the top six teams for unnecessary roughing penalties , the @entity9 said			2
after a january 2010 playoff game , @entity4 defensive players were fined $ 15,000 for fouls against the @entity257 , and after the @entity246 against the @entity259 , the @entity4 defense was fined a total of $ 30,000 for four illegal hits , several of which were directed against @entity232 , the @entity9 said			1
assistant head coach @entity23 acknowledged to investigators that the team 's " defensive meeting preceding the 2010 @entity246 may have ' got out of hand ' with respect to @entity232 , " the @entity9 said			1
a document written after a preseason game stated " 1 cart - off -- crank up the @entity271 ( sic ) tractor " in reference to a hit on an opponent , the @entity9 said			0
" similar statements are reflected in prepared documents or slides in connection with other games in multiple seasons			0
a review of the game films confirms that opposing players were injured on the plays identified in the documents , " the @entity9 said			0
last year , before the opener , head coach @entity3 " received an e-mail from a close associate that stated in part , ' ps @entity286 put me down for $ 5000 on @entity294 ( sic ) , ' " the @entity9 said			1
@entity3 told investigators that the e-mail referred to a " bounty " on @entity237 's @entity236 , the @entity9 said			2
@entity7 " acknowledged that he designed and implemented the ( bounty ) program with the assistance of certain defensive players " after being told by @entity3 to make the defense " nasty , " the @entity9 found			1
@entity7 kept records , determined the amount and recipients of the payouts , and distributed the " envelopes with cash to players who ' earned ' rewards , " the @entity9 said			2
but @entity7 was first questioned about the bounty program in early 2010 , " he intentionally misled @entity9 investigators and made no effort to stop the program after he became aware of the league 's investigation , " the @entity9 said			2
@entity0 's @entity318 and @entity319 contributed to this report .			0
