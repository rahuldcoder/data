-- bigger and better than before -- that 's the promise as the @entity2 returns to @entity3 this weekend , and hopes are rising that @entity5 will one day have its own permanent franchise			1
@entity10 will host @entity12 's overseas showpiece for the eighth year running and , for the first time , the home of @entity9 soccer will welcome three regular - season games , spread over the next six weeks			1
building on the two games it held last year and the one it hosted initially , overseas fans will get a rare glimpse of the @entity21 ' most popular sport			0
@entity2 commissioner @entity22 confirmed as early as february that the games had already sold out , meaning 270,000 spectators will witness the @entity25 take on the @entity26 , the @entity27 face the @entity28 and the @entity29 play the @entity30			1
why is the @entity2 staging games in @entity9 ? it 's all about growing the sport abroad and attracting more fans worldwide			2
the league has a long history of trying to extend its borders , dating back to 1952 when the @entity37 defeated the @entity38 in the " @entity40 " game at the old @entity10			2
the @entity2 made major strides when launching the " @entity42 " in 1986 -- a series of preseason exhibition games at @entity10 , which soon expanded to include @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
that kept running until 2005 , when @entity22 announced the league would replace it with the @entity2 -- the key difference being that matches would now be regular - season games rather than just exhibitions			2
and following on from 2005 's " @entity63 " in @entity50 -- the first regular - season game to be held outside the @entity21 -- the maiden @entity2 was staged at @entity10 in 2007 , with the @entity66 beating @entity26 , and it has been held there every year since			1
it will continue to do so until at least 2016			0
" when we heard we were accepted to play this game we were all excited about it , just the opportunity to come to @entity3 and to play a game that 's growing each and every year and to be part of it is a wonderful feeling for us , " @entity27 linebacker @entity68 told @entity0 ahead of his side 's game against the @entity28 on october 26			1
has the series proved to be a success ? the @entity2 has gone from strength to strength in the @entity5 since 2007 , as television ratings continue to grow , while more and more youngsters are getting involved with the sport			2
the @entity2 does not just stop with the action at @entity10 , though , as a whole host of activities are organized in the buildup to the matches , including the award - winning " @entity2 on @entity92			1
" almost 600,000 people packed @entity3 's famous thoroughfare last year as the street turned into a fan festival for the day			2
" it 's an incredible experience , " said @entity30 cornerback @entity98 of his time in @entity3 ahead of the november 9 clash against the @entity29			1
" the weather is beautiful , the experience so far is incredible , it 's a great opportunity to come out here and represent my organization and the @entity2			2
" but with the @entity2 bandwagon and @entity22 himself arriving in @entity3 under a cloud after the @entity113 scandal , the league will be more determined than ever for the @entity2 to run smoothly			1
how does the @entity10 experience compare to @entity21 @entity2 games ? what 's so unique about the @entity2 is that it allows fans access to a sport they may not often have the chance to experience live			1
according to the @entity2 , only 3 % of fans at recent games have been @entity21			2
" i hear the atmosphere in the stadium and the environment is similar to a @entity127 experience , " @entity98 adds			0
" i was at the @entity127 as a fan in @entity129 and i know the level of electricity and excitement in the air			0
and i know once the teams start rolling into town , this is going be pretty exciting around here both for the players and the fans			0
" who are the home teams and who are the away teams in the @entity2 ? the @entity29 , the @entity25 and the @entity28 are this year 's hosts			1
the @entity29 were the home side last year -- losing to the @entity143 -- and will be until 2016 , having become the first team to make a multi-year commitment to playing in the series , replacing the @entity147 , who backed out of a similar deal in 2012			0
teams that give up a home game in the @entity21 to play in @entity3 are often sides that have struggled in attracting supporters to their own stadiums , and so are enticed by the financial incentives of hosting matches overseas			2
a " home team " can make the trip abroad every year for up to five years , while an " away team " can only make the same journey once every five years			0
" every year there 's a few games you look forward to , " said @entity26 defensive end @entity160 ahead of sunday 's game against the @entity25			1
" obviously this is one			0
" " i knew right before i joined the @entity26 , in 2007 they came over here , so i figured we had a couple of years to wait to be picked again			0
so i 'm glad it 's this year and i know a lot of guys in the locker room feel the same way			0
" the idea of using certain regular sides as " home teams " was one proposed by @entity22 in an effort to build an overseas fan base for those sides and to ultimately raise the prospect of a permanent @entity2 team in the @entity5			0
so @entity5 so may get an @entity2 franchise ? one day , that could certainly be the case			0
@entity2 bosses are believed to be satisfied with the league 's current 32 - team model , and would prefer an existing side to make the move to @entity3 , rather than creating a new franchise			1
the @entity29 are reported to be the most likely team to be relocated , given their current agreement to play multiple games in @entity3 and that owner @entity195 also runs @entity3 soccer team @entity196			1
surely the logistics are a nightmare ? the @entity199 could prove to be a stumbling block			0
there does , however , seem to be a growing belief in the world of @entity2 that the teams can make this work			0
" obviously there 's travel ( which is a problem )			0
you could maybe play games here , have an off - week , being able to travel to the @entity21 , maybe stay in the @entity21 for a little bit longer to play some teams in the @entity21 and then come back , " @entity27 's @entity208 proposes			1
" after having three games that are sold out in @entity3 this year , it 's just a matter of time ( until a @entity5 franchise is a reality )			1
" " maybe it 's still some years down the road , but this is the way the @entity2 has evolved , " @entity219 ' @entity98 adds			0
" the direction the game has taken , we 're getting fans from all over and hopefully we can make the step in this direction and allow the fans to regularly just feel and see the passion that we have for this game			0

the @entity2 is back in @entity3 this weekend
for the first time , @entity10 will hold three games over six weeks
@entity25 kick things off against @entity26 sunday
@entity27 then face @entity28 and @entity29 play @entity30
