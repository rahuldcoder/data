-- you do n't have to be gay or even @entity2 to feel the wrath of the @entity2 government 's homophobia			1
you could go to jail if you are " pro-gay , " whatever that means			0
and that 's under just one of a growing number of hate - infused bills becoming law at a time when , as it happens , @entity2 is preparing to host the world in the next @entity15			1
the perverse anti-gay legislation is inflaming an atmosphere of persistent intimidation and at times deadly violence against @entity2 gays and lesbians			1
the question now is : what should the rest of the world do ? with the @entity28 coming to the @entity2 town of @entity30 on the @entity32 coast , president @entity26 and his country are about to receive a massive influx of publicity and cash			2
but exactly what kind of publicity -- and how much cash ? the world has an opportunity to let @entity26 -- who signed all the laws -- and the politicians he dominates know just how repulsive their actions are			2
there is a chance of helping @entity2 @entity48 activists persuade the government to reverse the most offensive legislation			2
ideas are already in play			0
human rights activists in the @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 are pushing for a boycott of the @entity15 or of @entity2 products such as vodka			1
an @entity62 boycott might not be the best way to go			2
instead , let 's turn the @entity15 into the gayest games in history			1
let the @entity2 police , if they want , arrest every athlete , every coach from @entity56 , @entity70 , @entity57 and other forward - looking countries -- that includes you , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			1
the teams should march during the opening ceremonies brandishing rainbow flags , holding hands , proclaiming that every one of them supports equal rights for gay and lesbians -- in @entity2 and everywhere else			1
make it an " i am @entity89 " moment for the world			0
let @entity26 arrest them all			0
and as for going as a tourist to the @entity28 : forget it			0
@entity2 lawmakers are making that boycott a no - brainer			1
@entity62 sponsors @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and others also have a responsibility to push against these blatant violations of human rights			0
keep in mind that @entity2 laws are encouraging vigilante " justice " against gays and lesbians			1
police have assaulted @entity113 marchers and looked the other way when thugs attacked peaceful demonstrators protesting discrimination			0
there have been gruesome killings that authorities acknowledge were motivated by homophobia			0
the talk of launching an @entity62 boycott is something the @entity125 dreads			0
the @entity125 has naively -- or disingenuously -- claimed it received " assurances from the highest level " that @entity2 police wo n't start rounding up suspected homosexuals and their suspected sympathizers during the @entity131			1
just imagine the sweeps of athletes , trainers and tourists , rounded up and sent to @entity2 prisons because they believe gays and lesbians should be treated like everyone else			1
and police could do just that : the country 's sports minister and a close ally of @entity26 , the legislator @entity141 , said the law will definitely be enforced and no exception will be made			0
violation of the propaganda law , which applies to @entity2 and foreigners , means a punishment of $ 3,000 in fines and up to 15 days in jail , followed by deportation , for anyone who even speaks about homosexuality			2
the legislation is already having an effect			0
@entity2 publications reporting on the laws already carry cringe - worthy disclaimers saying , " this article contains information not suitable for readers younger than 18 years of age , according to @entity2 legislation			1
" it 's easy to think the legislation is just symbolic , that it could n't possibly be serious , certainly not regarding foreigners			0
but last week , police arrested four @entity172 activists who had traveled to @entity2 to make a documentary on gay rights			1
and the anti-gay laws keep coming			1
there 's the law that allows police to arrest " pro-gay " tourists ; a law that labels as pornography and banned propaganda any writing or statement calling for tolerance or equality , and another law banning the adoption of @entity2 children by anyone in a country where there is marriage equality			1
there 's a rumor that the next law will remove children from same - sex couples			2
terrified parents have started sending their children away			0
some think the witch hunt against gays shows @entity26 is trying to deflect attention as the economy slows down and perhaps playing defense against opposition accusations that his friends have stolen as much as $ 30 billion in money earmarked for the @entity15			1
@entity26 has always understood the power of propaganda and has never shied from showing himself as relentlessly macho , able to take on tigers , ride horses bare - chested or catch the biggest fish while displaying his youthful musculature			0
the @entity2 president understands the power of images			2
for those who want to stop , or at least slow the vicious crackdown against gays , lesbians and anyone who supports equality , that provides an opportunity to push back			2
the only unacceptable course of action is doing nothing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			0

@entity235 : anti-gay laws in @entity2 outlaw supporting gays or calling for equality
anti-gay laws spur intimidation and at times deadly violence against gays , she says
@entity246 : @entity247 should make 2014 @entity15 in @entity2 a defiant gay and lesbian gala
it 's a no - brainer that tourists should boycott the @entity131
