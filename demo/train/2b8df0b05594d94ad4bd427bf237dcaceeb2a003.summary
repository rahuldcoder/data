demonstrations in parts of @entity2 ostensibly about an anti-islam film spiraled into chaos friday , as mobs ransacked banks , cinemas and government offices and engaged in clashes with authorities that left at least 15 dead			1
the protests were not confined to @entity2 , as @entity12 also hit the streets of @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
nor was the target of their ire new : muslim - led demonstrations have occurred daily since september 11 over an obscure , 14 - minute trailer for a film that mocks the @entity23 as a womanizer , child molester and killer			0
many protesters have vented their anger at the @entity29 , where the " @entity30 " was privately produced , despite @entity29 officials ' condemnation of the video and insistence it was not sanctioned by @entity36			2
and fresh fury has been stoked in recent days by @entity40 satire magazine @entity39 's decision to publish cartoons of a figure resembling @entity23 , prompting @entity40 to close diplomatic facilities in 20 countries friday			1
still , while many of the protests have been heated and at times violent , what transpired friday in @entity2 was unique in its size and focus -- or lack thereof -- with local institutions targeted as well as international ones			1
@entity2 authorities effectively gave their blessing to protests -- even as others , including the @entity58 government , banned them on friday fearing unrest -- " by declaring a national holiday in protest of the film , " noted prime minister @entity63			1
and , indeed , tens of thousands answered the call			0
most of them protested peacefully , with security forces out in large numbers as interior minister @entity70 warned friday afternoon that " strict action " would be taken against those who destroy property			0
yet there were significant exceptions , with authorities reporting 78 injured in addition to 15 killed in @entity77 and @entity78 alone			1
about 60,000 to 70,000 people turned out in the city of @entity82 , a northwestern @entity2 city about 60 kilometers east of @entity77 , senior police official @entity79 told @entity83			1
after the crowd dispersed around 4 p.m. after @entity20 prayers , an angry mob of about 700 teenagers broke into a church by storming past 15 police officers in the area , according to @entity79			1
after overcoming a security guard in the church , they vandalized and effectively destroyed the sanctuary , he added			2
police responded with tear gas and by firing into the air , ultimately making " several arrests and ... interrogating the hooligans , " said @entity79			0
many other buildings in the same neighborhood were attacked and , in some cases , set afire , police noted			0
@entity105 , another police official , said protesters also broke into and vandalized a nearby university and several government buildings			1
in @entity78 -- where , a day earlier , video showed about 100 children repeating an adult voice in chants such as " @entity114 " and " any friend of @entity29 is a traitor " -- angry protesters burned three cinemas and two banks , as well as set fire to tires in the streets			2
they also smashed windows and threw rocks at police who 'd tried to keep them from government offices and shops , according to a senior police official			1
protesters tried to reach the @entity29 @entity132 in @entity78 , but police using tear gas and firing into the air turned them back , emergency spokesman @entity130 said			2
local television news channels showed protesters throwing rocks at a @entity140 restaurant in @entity78			0
@entity140 shuts down all its restaurants in @entity2 the violence in the coastal city claimed at least nine lives , including at least two police officers , and injured 28 others , according to @entity130			1
two cinemas were torched in @entity77 , where six people died and at least 50 people were injured -- including three police officers -- according to @entity151 , a spokesman for the city 's emergency rescue service			1

@entity29 secretary of state @entity160 thanked the government of @entity2 for its efforts to protect @entity29 facilities during the protests and deplored the loss of life			1
" as i have said on numerous occasions , the violence we have seen can not be tolerated , " she said			0
opinion : protests as mindless as anti-islam film on the streets of downtown @entity156 , @entity2 citizens had mixed views on what fueled the protests			1
voicing her opinion to an open microphone set up by @entity83 on thursday in the @entity183 nation 's capital , one woman said , " they are angry about the movie			0
no one wants religion being insulted like that			0
" yet others said the furor was rooted in more than just the video , with another woman noting " many anti-religious movies have come out			0
" " they 're agitated because of ... poverty and unemployment " and the deepening gap between rich and poor , she said			0
opinion : # @entity198 inspires comedic rage more protests and one counter-protest -- hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators marched in @entity203 on friday night and overtook the headquarters of @entity205 , a radical @entity206 group tied to the attack			1
they also claimed to have freed at least 20 captives held in the building			0

" -- in @entity14 , supporters of @entity230 , a militant @entity206 group deemed a terrorist organization by the @entity29 , marched friday in a peaceful demonstration " in support of the @entity23 , " @entity230 tv channel @entity230 reported			1
