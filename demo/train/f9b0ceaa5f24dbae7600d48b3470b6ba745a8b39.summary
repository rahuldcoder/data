@entity0 -- the number of anti-semitic incidents around the world more than doubled from 2008 to 2009 , according to a @entity6 study			1
in 2009 , 1,129 such incidents were recorded -- an increase of more than 100 percent from the 559 incidents noted in 2008 , according to the study , released sunday by the university 's @entity11 for the @entity13			1
" in addition , many more hundreds of threats , insults , graffiti signs and slogans and demonstrations featuring virulently anti-semitic content were registered , sometimes resulting in violence , " the study said			1
researchers documented only those incidents that showed " clear anti-semitic content and intention , " according to the study			1
however , the actual number might be higher , as some @entity30 may not have reported incidents , the study said			2
the sharp increase can , at least partially , be attributed to @entity34 's incursion into @entity35 in late 2008 and early 2009			1
the 22 - day operation " triggered a wave of anti-semitic manifestations that swept the world , " the study said			1
" this trend subsided in february and march , but even during the months that followed this peak of anti-semitic incidents , the baseline remained higher than before the war			2
" in fact , there has been a rising trend since the early 1990s , even in years when there was no significant @entity52 trigger			0
thus , the origins of the 2009 escalation in anti-semitic expressions must lie deeper			2
" @entity56 of the @entity57 , a co-sponsor of the report , said : " in the past we have seen spikes in the level of @entity63 after violent events occurred in the @entity52 , but it would recede			0
but we have never seen such a sustained , organized campaign being waged against @entity34 's legitimacy and its supporters around the world			2
" the report said , " @entity71 lies at the core of much anti-israel and anti-semitic agitation			1
it encapsulates several and even contradictory themes : the @entity77 did not happen ; zionists use the @entity77 to divert attention from @entity34 actions against @entity81 ; it 's a pity that not all @entity30 were murdered in the @entity77 ; @entity34 behavior is comparable to that of the @entity84			1
" for purposes of the study , researchers considered incidents involving physical violence , not verbal threats -- an assault on an individual , for instance , vandalism at @entity30 institutions or arson			2
the largest increase in the number of violent anti-semitic incidents and vandalism in 2009 occurred in the @entity100 -- 374 , compared with 112 in 2008 , according to the study			1
the number of incidents in @entity104 rose from 50 to 195			1
there were repeated attacks on synagogues in @entity104 as well as a september incident in which a @entity110 cocktail was thrown at the @entity30 @entity111 in @entity112			2
no one was injured , but a fence and vehicles were damaged			0
the @entity100 and @entity104 are home to the largest @entity30 communities in @entity119 , the report said			1
both also have some of the largest @entity121 communities in the @entity122 " and since 2000 , in particular , have become centers for the activities of extremist anti-israel groups and individuals that preach and disseminate anti-semitic messages			1
" other incidents in @entity119 included a march 2009 attack on three @entity30 in @entity130 , @entity131			2
the victims were beaten with a steel bar , while the perpetrators shouted " @entity135 " or " @entity135 is great " and " @entity136 , @entity137 " or " jews , @entity30			0
" one victim was hospitalized with serious injuries , according to the study			0
in @entity143 , anti-semitic incidents rose from 13 in 2008 to 138 in 2009			1
the @entity144 posted a small rise -- 116 from 98			0
the study points out that many countries where @entity63 has risen have large @entity121 minorities			0
traditionally , in the past @entity63 acts were the product of right - wing , neo-nazi groups , but the study said most of the @entity119 incidents in which perpetrators were classified pointed to those of @entity158 or @entity121 background			1
the study expressed great concern over what it called " the abuse of the @entity77 as a political tool ... the equation of @entity34 / @entity161 / @entity30 supporters of @entity34 with @entity84 became practically an axiom in demonstrations and in expressions voiced in the political and academic arena			1
the equation of the @entity173 with the swastika symbolizes the ultimate evil --- extreme brutality and a disregard for human values -- and implies that those that allegedly behave like @entity84 , the monster of the modern era , have no right to exist			0
" anti-israel activists often insist they are not against @entity30 as individuals but are opposed to @entity34 policies regarding the @entity81			1
but the study insists that those distinctions are being blurred			0
" incited by demonization of @entity34 and the idea that ' jews must pay , ' perpetrators of anti-semitism make no distinction between @entity34 and @entity30 worldwide , who for them are part of a single evil entity			2
" the study was released the day before @entity198			0
sirens sounded nationwide in @entity34 for two minutes monday in observance			0
in remarks sunday night at a state commemoration of the day , @entity34 prime minister @entity201 took note of anti-israeli sentiment			0
" here we are today again , witnesses to the fire of the new - old hatred , the hatred of the @entity30 , that is expressed by organizations and regimes associated with radical @entity214 , headed by @entity215 and its proxies , " @entity201 said			0
@entity201 called on nations to oppose such sentiment			0
" if we learned anything from the lessons of the @entity77 , it is that we must not remain silent and be deterred in the face of evil			0
" @entity1 's @entity224 contributed to this report .			0
