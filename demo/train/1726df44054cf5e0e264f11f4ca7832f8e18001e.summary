-- a @entity3 - @entity2 summit ended tuesday with promises for more support from @entity6 for debt - straddled @entity7 , yet no concrete cash pledges to buy euro debt			1
it 's becoming a familiar scenario in the wake of the eurozone crisis			0
indebted nations have made repeated entreaties to @entity3 leaders for bail out help in the form of buying government debt bonds or direct investment			0
and , indeed , @entity6 has pledged to help , and @entity3 investment in @entity7 companies has skyrocketed			1
still , @entity6 bristles at accepting the " white knight " role @entity7 leaders clearly hope @entity3 will play			2
in a joint press conference with @entity31 president @entity30 and @entity33 president @entity32 , @entity3 premier @entity28 said , " @entity3 is firm in supporting the @entity2 side in dealing with the debt problems			2
we match our words with actions			0
" however , @entity28 added that it was up to debt - stricken nations -- such as @entity41 , which approved tough budget cuts ordered by the @entity2 amid escalating violence in @entity44 -- and the @entity2 to reduce its debt risks , echoing previous statements from @entity3 during the crisis			1
" the debt crisis relies fundamentally on the efforts made by the @entity2 itself , " @entity28 said			0
why is @entity2 seeking @entity3 help ? simply put , @entity3 has the money			2
for three decades @entity6 has averaged double - digit annual growth			0
even in the wake of the financial crisis , @entity3 's economic output dipped to a low of 8.7 % in 2009 -- albeit buttressed by a $ 600 billion government stimulus package			2
@entity3 , thanks to its extraordinary trade build - up in the past three decades , has amassed the world 's largest bank of foreign currency reserves at nearly $ 3.2 trillion			1
encouraging @entity3 to buy bonds for @entity41 or @entity2 debt would not only help the nations , but would bolster market sentiment for purchasing the bonds , and could help bring down borrowing costs for @entity7			1
why is @entity3 reluctant to help ? on monday , @entity3 central bank advisor @entity71 was at a @entity6 economics forum			0
when asked by reporters about investment in @entity7 debt he said : " we may be poor , but we are n't stupid , " according to @entity77			0
" we must follow commercial principles in making such investments			0
that means we want returns			0
" @entity84 chancellor @entity83 , in a visit to @entity3 earlier this month , had lobbied @entity85 , the state - owned $ 410 billion sovereign wealth fund , to invest in euro debt bonds			2
but @entity85 chairman @entity88 said monday that the fund would n't invest in @entity7 government bonds			0
yet in a speech wednesday , @entity3 central bank governor @entity91 said @entity6 would continue to invest in @entity7 government debt			2
the @entity3 public , however , is n't interested in playing the @entity2 's white knight			1
and @entity3 is facing a credit crisis of its own -- albeit writ small -- in a number of mid-tier cities such as @entity99 as once red - hot property markets cool			0
in @entity3 city , lenders outraged as bosses flee " i think domestically it 's very difficult for them to make that type of commitment from a political point of view , " @entity104 , dean of the @entity105 in @entity106 , told @entity0			1
" and to publicly do that when there is considerable need domestically would be very tough			0
" why does the @entity2 matter to @entity6 ? the mixed messages from @entity6 on helping the @entity2 come after an @entity117 report last week said fallout from the eurozone crisis could cut @entity3 's growth rate in half in 2012 , underlying the importance of the @entity2 market to @entity3			1
according to figures released by @entity125 this week , @entity3 was the @entity2 's second biggest trading partner after the @entity126 in the first 10 months of 2011			1
clearly , @entity3 's financial fate is closely linked to the future of its trading partners			0
" @entity3 has quietly behind the scenes been supporting the euro significantly in terms of shifting and rebalancing its foreign reserves , " @entity104 said			2
@entity3 companies are increasingly investing in @entity7			1
according to a capital 's @entity135 , @entity7 was the top destination in 2011 for investment -- a total of $ 10.4 billion in 2011 , up from $ 4.1 billion the year before			1
research from the @entity105 suggests that within 10 years , @entity3 will invest $ 1 trillion in @entity7 -- but it will likely be more in the form of direct investment in companies rather than buying government debt , @entity140 said .			1

an @entity2 - @entity3 summit ended with promises to help , but no cash pledge
@entity3 has the world 's largest foreign cash reserves of about $ 3.2 trillion
domestically , there is little political support in @entity3 to rescue the eurozone
@entity3 investment in @entity7 companies , however , has skyrocketed
