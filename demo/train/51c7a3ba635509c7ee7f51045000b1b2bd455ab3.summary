@entity0 -- the crew of a commuter plane that crashed outside @entity4 , @entity5 , in february may have responded improperly to signs the plane was stalling , according to details of the investigation released wednesday			1
only a few pieces of the @entity12 turboprop were recognizable after the crash			0
the crew of @entity15 pulled back on the plane 's control column when it received a stall warning , pulling the plane upward , an update released by the @entity21 revealed			1
that would have aggravated the situation rather than improving it , according to a veteran pilot contacted by @entity1			1
but investigators are far from determining the exact cause of the crash , the @entity21 said			2
and @entity28 , the plane 's operator , urged the public not to jump to conclusions			1
the @entity32 crashed into a house about six miles from @entity34 the night of february 12			0
all 49 people on the plane and one man who was in the house were killed			1
the pilot and first officer discussed " significant " ice buildup on the aircraft 's windshield and wings before the crash , the cockpit voice recorder revealed			2
but in an update on the investigation , the @entity21 said there is no indication that aircraft 's systems failed , or that ice had a significant impact on the plane			1
the @entity21 said a stall warning device known as a " stick shaker " appears to have behaved properly , activating when the plane 's speed dropped to 130 knots ( 150 mph )			1
at that point , however , " there was a 25 - pound pull force on the control column , " pulling the plane upward , and data suggests there was a " likely separation of the airflow over the wing " -- meaning the plane had stalled			1
" the circumstances of the crash have raised several issues that go well beyond the widely discussed matter of airframe icing , " the @entity21 's acting chairman , @entity68 , said in a statement on the findings			1
in general , when a stick shaker activates , pilots are taught to apply full power and maintain the plane 's altitude or lower the nose , a captain for a major airline told @entity1			1
" what you do n't want to do is aggravate the situation , " said the pilot , who would not be named because he had not sought approval from his airline			2
" by pulling it up without adding power , you 're aggravating the situation			0
" the safety board said it intends to investigate " stall recovery training " among other issues at a three - day public hearing it will offer on the crash in mid-may			2
@entity98 , a @entity99 pilot and aerospace consultant , said that appears to be what the @entity21 " is really looking at			2
" " it 's easy to build a lot of experience in airline flying without ever getting close to the edges of the envelope , " he said			0
in a statement issued wednesday afternoon , @entity28 said the @entity21 data does not pinpoint a cause , and its crews " are prepared to handle emergency situations they might face			0
" " we stand by our @entity118 - certified crew training programs which meet or exceed the regulatory requirements for all major airlines and include training on emergency situations , " the @entity116 - based carrier said			0
@entity28 said it is " cooperating thoroughly " with the investigation			0
" the only absolute fact is that we do not know the cause of this accident , " it said			0
information released wednesday appears to count out one possibility that was the subject of speculation after the crash : a stall induced by ice on the aircraft 's tail			2
pilots say those stalls are particularly insidious because pilots can not see the tail wings and because the recovery procedure is the opposite of a main - wing stall -- tail - wing stalls generally are overcome by raising the plane 's nose			1
the @entity21 said that toxicology tests of the flight crew were negative for alcohol or illicit substances			0
the captain tested positive for diltiazem , a prescription blood pressure medication the @entity118 had permitted him to use			0
at the board 's hearing in may , the @entity21 will look into a number of topics , including the effect of ice on the aircraft 's performance , cold weather operations , the crew 's experience and sleep issues			1
the board also will investigate " sterile cockpit rules , " or requirements that crews discuss only aircraft issues during critical phases of flight , such as take - offs and landings			0
@entity1 's @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
