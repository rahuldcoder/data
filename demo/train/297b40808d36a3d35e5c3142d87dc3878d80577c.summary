-- football commissioner @entity2 upheld suspensions for four current and former @entity5 players accused of taking part in a three - year " bounty " program , but he reduced the terms for two former team members , the @entity1 announced tuesday			1
former @entity5 defensive lineman @entity12 's three - game suspension was cut to one game , while the eight - game penalty given to @entity15 was cut to seven			2
but the two who remain with the @entity5 -- @entity19 and @entity20 -- saw no change to their suspensions , the league announced			2
@entity1 officials have concluded all four helped lead a program that offered bonuses to @entity5 players who inflicted injuries on opponents over a three - year period			1
@entity2 found the program " represented conduct detrimental to the league and professional football			1
" " our investigation disclosed nearly two dozen players who either contributed to , or received money from , the pool operated by the @entity5 ' defense			1
the four disciplined players either were involved in specific bounties on an opposing player , contributed substantially to the bounty program , engaged in payments that violated @entity46 rules or were untruthful when the program was initially investigated , " @entity2 said			1
@entity48 police : no state laws broken in @entity5 wiretapping case the @entity1 already has penalized the @entity5 and members of its coaching staff of the program , which operated from 2009 - 2011			1
the @entity55 , the player 's union , said it would " thoroughly " review @entity2 's decision " and review all options to protect our players ' rights with vigilance			1
" " for more than six months , the @entity1 has ignored the facts , abused the process outlined in our collective bargaining agreement and failed to produce evidence that the players intended to injure anyone , ever			0
the only evidence that exists is the @entity46 's gross violation of fair due process , transparency and impartiality during this process			0
" but in letters to the players , parts of which were released by the @entity1 , @entity2 wrote that he believes all four deserved suspensions			1
@entity81 , a @entity5 defensive captain , drew the longest suspension of the four			0
he was ordered to sit out a full season and is currently on the @entity5 ' injured reserve list			0
in a letter announcing his decision , @entity2 said he 's convinced @entity81 pledged $ 10,000 to any teammate who could hurt then - @entity89 quarterback @entity88 " to an extent that he would not be able to continue playing " in the 2009 @entity93 playoffs			2
" i recognize that you and some of your teammates have denied that you made such a pledge or claim not to recall your doing so , but i am persuaded , based on the entirety of the record before me , that you did so , " @entity2 wrote			0
" and i find that such a pledge or any similar incentive is conduct detrimental			2
" @entity2 said @entity19 , who has been on the field for the @entity5 this season , acknowledged that he approved of the program but denied " that anyone intended to inflict injury on any opposing player			2
" @entity1 commissioner @entity2 announces anti-bounty steps " even in the face of repeated appeals to ' crank up the @entity114 tractor and cart the guy off , ' you and others now claim that the objective was instead merely to ' knock the wind out ' of your opponents , requiring them to leave the game for only a play or two , " he wrote			1
" from the standpoint of player safety , fair competition and the integrity of the game , the issues with which i am concerned today , this kind of after - the - fact explanation is little more than wordplay that , in my judgment as commissioner , offers no basis on which to excuse conduct that does not belong in professional football			0
" as for @entity12 , now with the @entity135 , @entity2 said he had no evidence that the player had contributed to the bounty pool , but knew about it and did n't speak out against it			0
" your failure to act contributed to allowing this program to remain in place not only during the 2009 season , but for two additional seasons after that , " @entity145 wrote			0
meanwhile , @entity15 is now a free agent and will be credited with the five regular - season games he has missed so far -- leaving him to sit out two games once he 's signed to another team			0
@entity2 wrote that @entity15 tried to mislead investigators and block the @entity1 probe into the @entity5 and made several statements that were " not credible " during a mid-september meeting			1
@entity5 general manager said he did not eavesdrop @entity0 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
