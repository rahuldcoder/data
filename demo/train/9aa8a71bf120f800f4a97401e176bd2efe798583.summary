@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , @entity4 's newly appointed ceo , did not introduce a single product on tuesday			1
at @entity3 's first news conference since officially taking over for @entity4 co-founder @entity9 , his team of executives announced a new @entity10 , an application for sending greeting cards , and a location - based social network called find my friends			1
but @entity3 himself did not announce a single thing			2
to use artistic metaphors , perhaps that 's indicative of how @entity3 sees his role as @entity4 leader -- not as a sculptor but as an orchestra conductor			1
@entity9 is renowned for his ability to mold the shape of products during their development and for his involvement in seemingly trivial details of the business			2
he does not hesitate to tell his employees or powerful partners outside the company when he thinks they are wrong and need to rethink products			0
and , as even those who have been on the receiving end admit , he 's usually right			0
@entity39 co-founder @entity38 once said of @entity9 , " i 'd give a lot to have @entity9 's taste			2
" @entity3 , who filled in for @entity9 when he had taken medical leaves in past years , opened and closed tuesday 's @entity44 presentation alone , a role typically reserved for @entity9			1
the event was an important exam for @entity3 , and analysts say he passed			1
" i think @entity3 did fine today , " said @entity49 , an analyst at @entity51 - based market research firm @entity50 , who attended the keynote			1
" the bench picks up where @entity9 left off			2
" at @entity4 's developers conference in june , when @entity9 was on medical leave and @entity3 was filling in as interim ceo , @entity9 was the first to take the stage			1
at that event , he unveiled the ambitious @entity61 internet service and then concluded the keynote			0
on tuesday , however , @entity63 , who was @entity3 's first top - level executive appointment since becoming chief , handled the @entity61 segment			2
@entity3 , @entity4 's longtime operating chief before rising to ceo , has had limited stage experience			1
he appeared in @entity68 earlier this year for a @entity70 news conference where the @entity72 cellular giant announced that it would start carrying the @entity10			0
tuesday was @entity3 's first test on his home turf			1
although some observers on @entity76 griped during the event about a lack of eye - popping news , @entity3 appeared comfortable and confident			2
he recited his lines flawlessly , and cracked jokes about @entity83 making planes more fuel - efficient , which elicited hearty laughs			0
( however , @entity86 , @entity4 's marketing exec , drew the most laughs when describing the improved camera on the @entity44 and how hard it was to get a squirrel to stand still for a photo shoot			2
) @entity4 's fall announcements are typically held at a convention center in @entity93 and focus heavily on new ipods , but this one took place in a small auditorium on @entity4 's campus here , which limited the size of the crowd			2
" it 's sort of like inviting you into our home , " @entity3 said to a crowd of reporters , analysts and executives			1
" just 10 years ago , we launched the original @entity109 here , and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music			0
" in between discussing @entity114 openings in @entity115 and explaining sales and market share data , @entity3 made several comments that seemed humble and personal			0
" i consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for 14 years and am very excited about this new role , " he said at the outset			0
and he closed with , " i am so incredibly proud of this company			0
" the amount of preparation and rehearsal that went into @entity3 's onstage arrangement was evident , said @entity131 analyst @entity130 , who did not attend the event but followed along from @entity133			2
" i actually thought it was a little more crisp than a @entity9 presentation , " he said			1
" less story time , more presentation			0
it was extremely well timed			0
" the first row of seating in the room was filled with @entity4 execs , with one obvious omission			0
@entity9 , who is now an @entity4 director and chairman of its board of directors , was nowhere in sight and was not mentioned once during the presentation , though his presence was felt			1
the experience was different with @entity3 taking center stage , but not drastically			0
" certainly , the tone was different , " @entity49 said			0
" it does herald a certain cultural shift at @entity4			0
these events are n't going to be the same as they ever were			0
" " it 's not going to be the @entity9 show that generates headlines worldwide , " he added			1
@entity4 has carefully crafted the persona of @entity9 in recent years as a visionary who is dynamic , charismatic and likable , said @entity161 , a director for consulting firm @entity162			1
while @entity4 works its marketing magic on @entity3 , the company and its leader will need to figure out what role he should serve in the public eye			1
maybe @entity3 is well - positioned to conduct an orchestra of @entity4 's key supporting players			1
but will the company 's product launches continue to make the same splash without a superstar ?			0

new @entity4 ceo @entity3 passed his first test as presenter , analysts say
observer : a @entity3 keynote is unlike a " @entity9 show "
@entity3 looked more like an orchestra conductor than a *pitchman*
analyst : " i thought it was a little more crisp than a @entity9 presentation "
