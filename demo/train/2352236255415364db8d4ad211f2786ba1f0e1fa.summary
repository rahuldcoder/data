-- a political battle is shaping up in the @entity2 about whether to give gay and lesbian couples the right to wed -- a move that , if approved , would make @entity2 the seventh state in the nation to legalize same - sex marriage			1
how the issue plays out was the subject of a series of political thrusts and parries this week between a @entity16 - controlled state legislature and a @entity18 governor , who supports @entity2 's civil unions but opposes same - sex marriage			1
gov. @entity22 , a conservative favorite once thought of as a potential presidential contender , called tuesday for a state - wide referendum to settle the issue			1
" this issue that our state 's exploring , whether or not to redefine hundreds of years of societal and religious traditions , should not be decided by 121 people in the statehouse in @entity35 , " the governor said during a town hall meeting			0
" the institution of marriage is too serious to be treated like a political football			0
" the referendum would put the decision into the hands of residents of @entity2 , where recent polling suggests that those in favor of legalizing hold a slight majority			2
it would also largely absolve @entity22 from making good on a pledge to veto the bill during a legislative session -- a move that analysts say may help preserve his conservative credentials , while presumably stealing a win from @entity16 lawmakers who have long pushed for the measure			2
a recent @entity59 poll found that 52 % of @entity2 voters are in favor of legalizing same - sex marriage			1
but @entity22 's @entity16 opponents argue that a referendum should n't be used to decide civil rights issues , pointing to historic legislative and judicial decisions regarding the rights of @entity68 and women			1
" we do not put civil rights questions on the ballot , " senate majority leader @entity70 said tuesday			0
" with all due respect to my colleagues at the other side of the table , a couple of them took a cop out			0
" @entity22 's statement tuesday also frustrated gay - rights advocates , whose spirits were buoyed a day earlier with the governor 's nomination of @entity86 , @entity2 's first openly gay state @entity89 justice if confirmed			1
" it 's abhorrent to put civil rights on the ballot , " said @entity90 , chairman of a gay and lesbian rights group called @entity93			2
" they want to corrupt the political system with donor money			0
the kind of money that we ca n't raise			0
" the likelihood of a referendum reaching voters is uncertain given the makeup of the @entity16 - controlled state legislature			2
activists , in opposing such referendums , often point to the politics of @entity111 and @entity112			0
in 2009 , @entity111 state legislators passed a same - sex marriage bill that drew subsequent challenges by opponents who pushed for a referendum that ultimately overturned the law with 53 % of the vote			1
still , gay rights advocates in @entity111 this week garnered thousands of signatures in an effort to force a second referendum in november			1
in @entity112 , a 2008 public vote outlawed gay and lesbian couples ' right to wed. two years later , a federal district court overturned the voter - approved measure known as @entity129 , saying couples were unfairly denied their rights			1
the ban has remained in place during the appeals process and could soon get a ruling from the @entity136 @entity89			0
similar battles have also unfolded in @entity139 and @entity138 , where same - sex marriage opponents have pressed for referendums to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their state houses			1
earlier this week , @entity146 -- once considered the holdout vote in @entity138 's 49 - member @entity148 , said she would step in as the crucial 25th vote in order to pass the marriage bill			2
supporters say the legislation already has a majority behind it in the state @entity156 , and @entity138 's @entity16 gov. @entity158 pledged to sign the bill if passed			0
but opponents told the @entity161 that they are n't done fighting			0
@entity162 , director of the @entity163 of @entity138 , said the issue should be put to a public vote			2
" if we as a state are going to take the position that mothers and fathers are interchangeable and replaceable , if we are going to send a message to fathers and potential fathers in this state that it is n't important to be in the lives of their children because dads specifically do n't matter , that is something we should all do together , " he said			0
in june , @entity181 gov. @entity180 signed into law a bill that made his state the sixth to legalize same - sex marriage , more than doubling the number of @entity68 living in places that permit such unions			1
five other states -- @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 -- and the @entity196 currently grant same - sex marriage licenses			1
with @entity198 and @entity199 joining the list earlier this month , five other states now recognize civil unions , according to the @entity202			0
@entity2 , @entity203 and @entity204 also recognize civil unions providing state - level spousal rights to same - sex couples			2
@entity0 's @entity207 contributed to this report			0
