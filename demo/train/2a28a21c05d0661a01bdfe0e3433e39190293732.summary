this is the dark underbelly of @entity0 -- @entity8 's gambling capital			1
the only @entity11 territory where casinos are permitted , the city has transformed itself in little more than a decade from a sleepy backwater to a neon - lit monument to @entity11 's passion for gambling			1
gambling revenues in the city surpassed @entity19 in 2006 and are now six times greater			1
but the former @entity23 colony 's dramatic rise has come at a cost , with many in @entity0 questioning whether growth has been too fast and furious			1
" you really do n't know whether society as a whole has benefited , " said @entity27 , an associate professor in gambling studies at the @entity29			0
@entity23 lawyer @entity33 , 47 , has experienced first hand the city 's more brutal side			1
last month , he was attacked in broad daylight by two men as he walked his five - year - old son to pre-school in what he believes was an intimidation attempt linked to his work as a lawyer			1
" i was walking with my son and suddenly i felt a huge blow on the back of my head , " he told @entity1 from his office just a block away from where the attack took place			0
" i turned around , already bleeding , and he threw another blow toward my head and then a second guy came at me from behind			0
" i could n't run away because my son was there			0
i needed to protect him			0
" @entity33 , who injured his wrist and required stitches to his head , said the two assailants each had a brick tied to one of their hands			0
" i was told it 's a technique used by mafioso in mainland @entity11 , because they can carry it without being seen as a weapon			2
" a spokesman for @entity0 's @entity69 , confirmed that the lawyer was attacked by two @entity11 men brandishing hard objects who later fled			1
they added the case was under investigation			0
in the run - up to the city 's return to @entity11 , gang violence was commonplace , claiming the lives of some 37 people in 1999 alone -- though violent crime became rarer as the city 's gaming market boomed			1
however , some recent cases have unsettled residents			0
in 2012 , a longtime operator of @entity90 casino junkets , @entity91 , was beaten by six men in his hotel in what was reportedly a dispute with his ex-lover			0
the city also feared a return to violence after the release of a notorious gangster known as @entity103 - kio or " @entity104 " in december after 15 years in prison			0
watch : ' @entity104 ' released from prison @entity33 says he rarely goes out to socialize and he can not think of a personal motive for the attack : " i have no doubt that it 's linked to work			2
it is definitely an attempt to intimidate me or put me out of action for a few months			2
" i was working on cases that could bring direct or collateral damage -- collateral in the sense that there are third parties that are affected by what i am doing , " he said , declining to say who he thought was behind the attack			2
as a precaution , he has recruited a security guard cum secretary , but @entity33 says he intends to stay put and continue representing his clients			0
@entity124 , a former intelligence officer with the @entity126 police and a specialist in triad activities , claimed @entity0 's gaming sector retains deep ties to organized crime			1
" the scene has changed over the past 10 years as the pie has vastly increased , " said @entity124 , who now runs a specialist risk mitigation and corporate intelligence consultancy @entity133			0
" it 's not the cowboy town it was when @entity104 was running around			2
" the big boys have moved in ... and they do not want visible street fights , with people being beaten up because it 's bad for business and brings attention			2
" by and large , @entity0 remains a safe place with 182 violent crimes reported in the first three months of this year , up one from the same period a year earlier , according to figures from the @entity148			1
the city is home to 500,000 people , while @entity0 's three dozen casinos attract more than 28 million visitors a year			1
@entity124 says that while the city 's big casinos , some owned by @entity159 tycoons @entity160 and @entity161 , operate correctly and legally , they work in a " messy environment			1
" they are reliant on income from high rollers and these @entity166 are usually brought in from @entity11 by junket operators			0
" the junkets are an integral part of the gaming scene and they facilitate the transfer of funds , the finding of the high rollers and they facilitate the breaching of @entity11 capital controls			2
" you wo n't find their names on the front ( door ) but the hard reality is that @entity11 junkets are largely controlled by triad societies			0
" @entity11 tightly controls the amount of money individuals can take out of the country , with a limit of 20,000 yuan ( $ 3,262 ) per day and citizens traveling to @entity0 , which is considered a special administrative region , are subject to these limits			1
however , @entity11 has turned a blind eye to the abuse of capital controls , said @entity124 although he added , this could change as the country 's new leaders look to crack down on corruption amid worries about officials funneling money through the city			2
@entity0 government officials did not immediately respond to a request from @entity1 for comment			1
the triads are also said to be involved in prostitution rings , another bone of contention for local @entity0 residents -- although prostitution is not illegal			1
@entity0 is on a @entity210 watch list for human trafficking and according to the 2012 report , criminal syndicates are involved in recruitment			1
it says many women fall prey to false advertisements for casino jobs but upon arrival are forced into prostitution			0
many of the city 's sidewalks and underpasses are littered with prostitutes ' calling cards and fliers for saunas and pole dancing clubs			2
" i do n't know how to explain this to my children , " said @entity27 at the @entity29			0
authorities are keen to diversify @entity0 's appeal and turn the city into a broader entertainment destination that attracts families and not just casino goers			1
new resorts boast attractions like wave pools , fake beaches and high - class dining but there 's little evidence that sales of spa treatments and slap - up meals will ever begin to approach revenue from the gambling tables			0
" i do n't think promoting a more family - friendly environment will be easy , " said @entity27 .			0
