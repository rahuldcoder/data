-- bicycles and airplanes might not seem like the greatest travel partners			0
yet two wheels and two wings can co-exist in surprisingly beautiful ways			0
consider the airport bike path , an increasingly popular feature at airports around the world			1
some allow travelers to pedal right up to their plane , while others skirt airport perimeters , permitting cyclists a closeup view of the behemoths of the sky			0
here 's a selection of world favorites			0
@entity22 ( @entity23 ) cycling in the @entity26 capital 's infamous traffic is generally the preserve of the borderline suicidal			1
a different experience awaits with the newest of the world 's airport bike routes			1
at just more than the 15 miles long , the traffic - free loop circumnavigates @entity23 's @entity22 ( sometimes referred to as @entity32 )			1
it 's free , though cyclists need to show @entity35 for access			0
the smooth , green - tarmacked track was formerly part of an access perimeter road used during the airport 's construction about a decade ago			2
it 's now used by all sorts of riders , notably the rapid , sporty variety , who use it as a training route			0
this is n't the oddest sporting facility you 'll find at a @entity23 airport			1
the city 's older international hub , @entity32 , has a @entity55 golf course between its two runways			2
anyone can play , but be prepared for your golf bag to be checked first for surface - to - air missiles			2
@entity61 ( @entity62 , @entity63 ) whatever @entity23 is to cyclists , the @entity63 capital is the opposite			1
cycling is n't a hobby here , it 's a way of life			0
throughout the city are miles of carefully planned , segregated bike lanes full of pedaling @entity63			2
given that , and the fact the city 's @entity61 is just six or so miles from the center , it 's no surprise this is one of the world 's smoothest bike - to - plane experiences			1
there are a range of traffic - free bike lanes all the way from the city to airport terminal buildings , and you can leave your bike directly outside the airport , assuming there 's space ( lots of airport employee ride to work )			1
that leaves the conundrum of transporting large baggage			0
@entity62 cycling blogger @entity98 has a solution : he 's been known to collect guests , bags and all , from the airport on a cargo bike , the voluminous , box - fronted machines common in the city			1
one caveat to all this bike joy is that it 's largely for the locals -- there is , as yet , no bike rental outlet at the airport			2
@entity112 ( @entity113 , @entity114 ) if you 've ever had the urge to see the belly of a plane operated by budget carrier @entity119 from a distance of about 20 meters but just did n't know how , here 's the answer			1
@entity124 , one of the @entity113 , a compact , volcanic smudge off the coast of northwest @entity128 , is already something of a draw for serious road cyclists with its lightly trafficked roads , idyllic scenery and perma - spring climate			1
there 's also a quiet , largely traffic - free bike lane along the coast from the main resort of @entity139 to the island 's quiet capital , @entity142			1
aside from passing beaches , bars and restaurants , it skirts @entity142 's surprisingly busy seafront airport			2
those in the know stop just beyond the fence at the tip of the southwest - facing runway			1
takeoffs are exciting -- an increasingly loud roar that crescendos when a plane suddenly shoots overhead			2
on a clear day ( and most days are clear ) you can watch aircraft landing lights draw near for several minutes as the plane draws closer , finally just clearing the fence -- and you -- before landing			0
you know you do n't have to duck but you still might			0
@entity164 @entity164 's busy international airport describes itself as " committed " to helping more people ride to and from its location on a semi-detached island a little more than 10 miles from the city center			0
an official airport map has a range of cycling options , including cycle lanes adjoining roads and shared pathways , with no fewer than five sets of bike parking racks scattered between the terminals			1
if you arrive weary from a flight and decide you simply ca n't face a ride into the city , the airport 's rapid rail transit system happily transports bikes ( apart from two hours during peak commuter times )			0
@entity188 ( @entity189 ) @entity188 , it 's fair to say , is n't on many list of the world 's great aviation hubs			2
but it is the @entity189 's third busiest airport , handling 20 million passengers a year			0
and it has a defunct concorde on display			0
far less known is that @entity188 -- located in the @entity200 countryside about 10 miles from the city center -- possesses an eight - mile orbital cycleway			1
this bike route is so close to the action it features a pair of tunnels passing under the twin runways			1
the route also takes in some lovely countryside adjoining the @entity211 , and a selection of pubs			0
it 's more often used for leisure riding and plane spotting than riding to catch flights , though some do			0
@entity219 is a journalist based in the @entity189 who regularly contributes to cycling publications			0
he once rode a bike most of the way from @entity223 to @entity224 .			2

@entity188 has an orbital cycle path with a pair of tunnels passing *beneath* runways
bikers experience planes flying overhead on the southwest side of the @entity112 in the @entity113
@entity23 has a 15 - mile bike path that loops around @entity22
