" i was hoping that a credible , fresh face would stand up to do it but unfortunately that is not the case			0
so that 's why i decided to take my own responsibility , especially after what i said in @entity31 and therefore i go for it			0
" @entity7 has to be normalized and @entity7 has to be modernized			2
in my business life and also in @entity34 and also in my association , i went through this exercise many , many times so i have a lot of experience in that respect			0
so i believe i 'm the right person to do it			0
" @entity43 's announcement comes just a day after @entity11 said , in an interview with @entity1 , that @entity48 " lacked the courage to come in " and stand against him in the presidential elections			1
@entity43 is one of a number of candidates hoping to topple the leader of football 's world governing body , who has been in the job for 17 years			1
after being re-elected unopposed in 2011 , @entity11 could now face @entity0 , former @entity56 and @entity58 footballer @entity57 as well as independent candidate @entity59 in may 's ballot			2
@entity43 was president of the @entity10 ' most successful club @entity34 between 1989 and 2003 , following in the footsteps of his father @entity63			0
during his reign @entity34 added six @entity4 league titles to its roll call of honors , the current total now standing at 33			1
@entity43 has also been a member of @entity48 's @entity69 since 2009			0
@entity11 announced his intention to step down at the end of his fourth term but backtracked at @entity7 's congress in @entity74 last year , claiming his mission was " not yet finished			1
" that decision drew criticism from a number of @entity7 member countries , given the allegations of corruption relating to the bidding process for the 2018 @entity83 , awarded to @entity84 , and the 2022 installment , given to @entity86			2
@entity43 was one of those to suggest @entity11 should step down , telling him at a meeting of @entity90 officials : " few people still take @entity7 seriously and , however you look at it , @entity11 is mainly responsible			1
" you are not making things easy for yourself and i do not think you are the man for the job any longer			0
" @entity7 's image has deteriorated because of everything that 's happened in recent years			0
people link @entity7 to corruption and bribery and all kinds of old boy 's networks			0
" @entity11 enjoys firm support from the majority of @entity7 's 209 member associations and many see may 's elections as a forgone conclusion , despite the last few being blighted by scandal and difficulty			1
the @entity111 enlisted @entity113 lawyer @entity112 to probe claims that @entity86 's former @entity116 member @entity115 used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid , charges that @entity86 bid have strenuously denied			0
@entity112 quit his role as chairman of the @entity122 of the @entity123 after objecting to the way his report into the bidding process had been summarized by @entity128 judge @entity127 -- the organization 's independent ethics adjudicator			0
@entity115 was the only challenger to the president four years ago but withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges , leaving @entity11 to run unopposed amid farcical scenes at the congress in @entity136			2
the head of @entity90 soccer 's governing body , @entity140 , has called on @entity11 to stand down , but announced he would not personally be running for president			1
it remains to be seen whether @entity57 , or any of his fellow candidates , can make a significant dent in the support @entity11 holds among @entity7 's members , and make the may elections anything more than another forgone conclusion .			1
