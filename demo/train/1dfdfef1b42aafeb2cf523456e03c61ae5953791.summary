-- @entity2 's cricket tour of @entity3 lurched to new lows on friday , which proved to be unlucky january 13			1
the visitors slumped to a disappointing 161 all out in @entity7 and then saw @entity8 smash the fourth fastest century in @entity11 history as @entity3 reached 149 - 0 at stumps on day one			1
down 2 - 0 in the four - match series , the second - ranked @entity13 went into the third encounter with doubts about the pitch at the @entity18 after ground staff were filmed on thursday night drinking beer and walking on the playing surface in bare feet			1
curator @entity23 defended his employees on national radio			0
they traditionally have pre-match drinks under the scoreboard , but this time followed @entity23 out to the middle for his final check			0
@entity31 falls short again as @entity32 take 2 - 0 lead " we were working on it ... up until the toss of the coin we can do anything we want to the wicket , " he told @entity34 , revealing that @entity36 and @entity18 chief executive @entity35 had questioned him about the situation			1
" we were there for an hour			0
so , the thing that @entity36 and certainly the @entity18 have done is got all the facts and said , ' that 's a legitimate reason for you being out there , it 's not as though you were just sitting on the wicket drinking beer for two hours			1
' " the @entity7 pitch had been described as a " @entity52 " by local media earlier this week , and @entity2 's formidable batting line - up performed -- once again this series -- with a timidity far below their stature			1
@entity59 inspires @entity32 win in @entity61 @entity62 claimed four wickets and fellow fast bowler @entity64 took three , while 21 - year - old @entity65 celebrated his third @entity11 call - up -- and first of this series -- with figures of 2 - 39			2
@entity68 snared just one scalp in his first outing since november , but it was a key one as cricket 's record run scorer @entity31 was trapped leg before wicket for 15 to leave the 38 - year - old " @entity31 " still seeking his record 100th international century			2
@entity76 top - scored with 44 , adding 68 for the fifth wicket with @entity78 ( 31 ) before both fell to @entity64			0
if @entity2 's batsmen found it hard against the four - man pace attack , the bowlers received a fearful pummeling from @entity8			1
finding his feet in the five - day game after being initially introduced as a limited - overs specialist , the left - hander smashed 104 from 80 balls , hitting 13 boundaries and three sixes as he raced to his second century			2
@entity8 shrugged off a blow to the head from a delivery by @entity97 to pass three figures in 69 balls faced , reaching the milestone with a clubbed six off debutant medium pacer @entity101			2
it matched @entity104 's effort for the @entity105 against @entity3 in 2003 , and is the second - fastest at the @entity18 behind compatriot @entity107 's 57 - ball effort against @entity108 in 2006			1
