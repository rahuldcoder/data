-- on safari in @entity2 ? surely the place has been settled too long for that -- roads and real estate must have edged out the wild creatures that once roamed the continent			1
with an intrepid spirit -- and a dose of patience -- you 'll find big game experiences from the @entity14 to the shores of the @entity16			2
polar bear ( @entity18 ) not many places in the world make you carry a gun when you 're leaving town			1
@entity23 , @entity18 's frozen northernmost territory , does			1
anyone leaving a settlement is required by law to carry a rifle in case they need to kill a polar bear in self - defense			1
the world 's largest land carnivore , polar bears prey mainly on ringed seals , but without a bear - sized gun you could become a snack			1
@entity39 between @entity18 and the @entity40 , @entity23 is an archipelago of black rock , snow and glaciers surrounded by ice floes			1
it 's hard to believe that anything could live here , but these islands and the waters around them are home to about 3,000 polar bears			1
they spend much of their time at sea , so it 's often best ( and safest ) to see them from a boat			1
plenty of companies offer boat trips in small expedition vessels from @entity64 , @entity23 's main town , including @entity66 and @entity67			1
bear sightings are almost guaranteed , with basking walruses a bonus			2
when to go : midsummer , when 24 hours of daylight give you plenty of time to see bears and other wildlife			2
rifle rental costs around $ 30 per day from adventure travel stores on @entity64 's main street			1
you need special permission from the governor of @entity23 or a weapon license to carry a rifle			1
@entity84 and @entity18 fly to @entity64 from @entity85			1

@entity87 ( @entity88 ) @entity88 : moose capital of the world			2
the country has more of the creatures per square kilometer than anywhere else in the world			2
despite the best efforts of @entity88 hunters , around 250,000 moose ( more often known as elk in @entity2 ) roam the country 's forests			1
in autumn , they sometimes wander into towns and villages , drunk on fermented apples			0
the rest of the time , moose can be hard to find , blending into their native habitat with surprising ease for such a large animal			0
one of the best places to see them is the @entity115 forest ( wolves and beaver also inhabit the forest ) , two hours ' drive from @entity120			2
from the @entity122 ( @entity123 , 73992 @entity124 ; +46 70 400 7053 ) -- billed in self - deprecating style as " @entity88 's most primitive hotel " -- you can set off on a twilight moose - spotting walk with every chance of seeing groups of up to 20 of the magnificent beasts			1
when to go : august - september is the best time to see big bull with mighty antlers			0
getting there : @entity136 train station is two kilometers from the eco-lodge			0
@entity138 ( @entity139 ) fewer than 250 @entity141 lynx survive in the wild -- most in the @entity16 forests of the @entity144 , in @entity145 , and in the grasslands and pine woods of the @entity148 , close to the mouth of the @entity150			1
you need to spend up to a week ( and rise before dawn ) in the @entity153 or the @entity148 to maximize your chances of seeing @entity2 's only big cat			1
if lynx fail to show up , you may see mouflon , red and fallow deer , wild boar and spectacular birds , including black vulture , griffon vulture , imperial eagle and -- in the coastal wetlands of the @entity148 -- flamingos			2
when to go : all year			0
@entity166 , @entity167 , kilometer 13 , @entity168 , approximately 100 kilometers east of @entity169 ; +34 953 549 030 @entity170 , @entity171 , approximately 130 kilometers southwest of @entity172 ; +34 959 442 340 wild horses , wild cattle ( @entity175 ) it 's a bizarre sight			2
in a feral enclave surrounded by the most artificial landscape in @entity2 -- those parts of the @entity175 reclaimed from the sea -- thousands of wild horses , red deer and @entity184 cattle roam			1
an expanse of almost 60 square kilometers of meadows and wetlands , @entity185 is the result of " rewilding " an area of land reclaimed from the sea that was originally zoned for industry			0
when the original plans remained undeveloped , @entity175 scientists introduced deer , konik ( " little ponies " ) from @entity198 and @entity184 cattle			0
the last are relics of a 20th - century @entity202 attempt to recreate the giant aurochs of northern @entity2 , extinct since the 17th century			1
vast flocks of graylag geese add to the feeling that you 're deep in the wilderness			0
in fact , you 're just more than 60 kilometers from @entity211			0
when to go : all year , but best in spring and autumn			0
@entity212 , @entity213 1 , 8218 aa @entity214 ; +31 320 254 585 ; visit by guided walking tour only			0
getting there : @entity218 train station is two kilometers from the visitor center			0
@entity220 ( @entity198 , @entity221 ) straddling the border between northeast @entity198 and @entity221 , the @entity222 is @entity2 's last remaining expanse of primeval woodland			1
it 's home to the only wild herd of @entity229 bison , also called wisent or , in @entity198 , zubr			2
about 450 of these huge , shaggy beasts live in @entity233 ( +48 85 682 9700 ) on the @entity198 side of the border , where they plod through snow - covered meadows in winter and graze on bison grass in summer			0
the forest is also home to elk , red and roe deer , wild boar , wolf , beaver and lynx -- but the bison is the big ticket attraction			1
when to go : all year round , but best between may and september			0
getting there : @entity248 is about 260 kilometers ( 4 hours , 20 minutes ' drive ) east of @entity250			0
by rail to @entity252 , then bus to @entity248 village			0
@entity255 ( @entity256 ) @entity256 's rugged , sparsely populated interior provides a refuge for one of @entity2 's most striking mountain mammals : the mouflon			1
much of the island 's fierce hinterland is contained within the @entity264 of @entity256 , where maquis scrub and high pine forests provide a refuge for the endemic wild sheep that 's the island 's emblem			2
beneath the towering 2,710 - meter summit of @entity271			0
@entity274 , the high alpine meadows of the @entity273 are home to @entity256 's biggest mouflon population			2
when to go : spring and autumn			0
@entity277 , @entity278 , @entity273 ; +33 495 47 82 07 ; about 70 kilometers west of @entity279 brown bear ( @entity281 ) the swathes of uninhabited taiga along @entity281 's border with @entity285 are the best place in @entity2 to see brown bear close up			1
in summer , you can hope to see as many as 20 bears in one night at the @entity289 ( @entity290 131 , @entity291 ; +358 8736 160 ) -- wolf and wolverine are sometimes seen here , too			0
females with cubs make their appearance in june , adolescents turn up throughout the summer , big males come and go			0
you 'll be watching at night from a carefully camouflaged ( and comfortable ) hide			0
bears are likely to be 10 - 30 meters away from you , but with luck -- and if you stay quiet and still -- they may come closer			0
when to go : may to mid-august			0
getting there : flights and trains from @entity304 to @entity305 , 160 kilometers south of @entity306 .			0
