@entity1 , @entity0 -- in situations like the dire humanitarian crisis that has followed tuesday 's earthquake in @entity7 , we all are forced to witness what is the sometimes painful truth behind the cliché about it taking a village to raise a child			1
in the tragedy unfolding before us now , it will take a global village			0
president @entity18 and former presidents , along with other leaders and representatives of humanitarian organizations , have reminded us of this			0
we would like to add our own small , humble contribution to the efforts under way around the world to help the people of @entity7			2
in particular , we would like to draw your attention to the many children who were living in @entity7 orphanages when the earthquake hit			1
as we have heard from professionals devoted to children 's issues , children are among the most vulnerable segments of a population subject to natural disasters and humanitarian crises			2
it is not hard to imagine that orphans living in institutional care might often be even more vulnerable			2
watch couple 's interview with @entity44 right now , orphanages across @entity46 are struggling to provide the most basic necessities to the children in their care			1
but right now , all @entity7 in the capital are struggling to do this			2
what makes @entity7 's orphans different is that they have no families to take care of them , and no hope of reuniting with their families			1
except for the orphanages ' staff members , most of whom have families of their own to which they rightly must divide their attention , these children have no one			1
@entity67 : looking for loved ones in @entity7 our adoptive son , @entity69 , is one of the children without a family			1
he was left , just hours after his birth , near a hospital in @entity75 and , with the permission of @entity7 's @entity78 du @entity77 , brought to one of the homes of the @entity82 orphanage in @entity46			1
he was named after one of the @entity85 volunteers , @entity83 , who works alongside @entity7 staff to care for orphaned children			1
@entity88 , or @entity89 , is 17 months old , and @entity90 is about 21			0
@entity90 and the rest of the @entity93 staff have been the only family @entity69 has ever known			2
and although we will never know for sure , especially not after the earthquake , anything about her , we firmly believe that his birth mother loved @entity69 and did what was in her power to ensure that he would have a brighter future than she could provide			2
hers was , we believe , an act of sacrifice , but it was also an act of hope and trust -- hope that the world would be kind to @entity69 , perhaps even despite her own experience , and trust that someone would love him as much as she does			0
though she will never know us , the faith that she has placed , even indirectly , in us is quite simply astounding			0
or at least it was until tuesday			0
now , we imagine that we share another bond with her : we would willingly make whatever personal sacrifice we have to to save @entity69 's life			2
as parents who are adopting across national , linguistic and cultural boundaries , we are sensitive to all of the complicated issues that arise in international adoption , and we support both the integrity of @entity7 families and the commitment to finding loving homes for children who are in need of them			1
since being matched with @entity69 in april , we have traveled to @entity7 four times to get to know him and the country of his birth			1
each successive trip impressed upon us more and more the dignity of the @entity7 people and the sense of commitment they show for each other			0
from what we have seen of the people of @entity7 when we have been there with @entity141 , they care deeply about all children -- orphans and those still living with their families			1
many likely would help the orphans through this crisis if they could , but they simply can not			0
as @entity69 's mother put her trust in the people who , as fate would have it , turned out to be us , we are placing our trust in others to join our efforts to secure the life of our child and the rest of the orphans of @entity7			1
this is no longer an adoption matter			0
it 's a matter of life and death			0
we have been told by the @entity93 staff that the children living in orphanages before the quake need to be evacuated from @entity7 to save their lives			1
we are aware that evacuating these children under such circumstances is temporary and might affect our adoption proceedings , potentially negatively			0
we also understand that it could mean that @entity69 will never live in the home we have waiting for him			0
but he 's our son , and we want him to live			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 and @entity178 .			0

in @entity7 crisis , children are most vulnerable and orphans most of all
**authors** are in the process of adopting @entity69 , a 17 - month - old orphan in @entity46
children in @entity7 orphanages need to be evacuated , according to staff of institution
priority is saving the life of @entity69 and his *fellow* orphans , the **authors** say
