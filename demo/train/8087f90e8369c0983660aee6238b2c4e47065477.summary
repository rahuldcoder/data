-- when @entity2 first called his director for " @entity4 , " @entity1 told him that he had had an inspiration after reading the script			1
@entity1 wanted to make the set - in - @entity8 film similar to " @entity9 " by making the mutant a @entity11 with healing powers			1
@entity2 had n't seen the classic @entity14 film , so @entity1 sent him a copy			1
" i felt like tonally , it would give him a clue of what i was talking about , " the director said			2
the director started thinking about the deep affinity between gun - slinging westerns and swordfighting samurai films			1
@entity1 thought that drawing upon both of them would help " @entity4 " stand apart from the rest of the @entity30 series			1
this installment takes place after " x-men : @entity37 , " as @entity4 retreats from killing the love of his life , @entity38 , and heads to @entity8			2
it is based on the comic by @entity42 and @entity43 , and @entity1 thought of it as @entity2 in a @entity45 in @entity8 , without the horse			2
to make sense of this movie mashup , the director tweeted images from the top ten inspirations for " @entity4 , " daring fans to identify them			1
@entity54 fans of @entity1 's body of work ( which includes " @entity57 , " " @entity58 " and " 3:10 to @entity59 " ) might have spotted the 1959 @entity61 film " @entity62 , " since the director has cited it as one of the best films of all time as well as a major influence on his first film , " heavy			1
" " @entity61 is the most underappreciated @entity8 director , in my mind , " @entity1 said			1
" for me , the whole trip that @entity71 takes south to the @entity73 area , it 's almost the reverse train trip that the older couple take in ' @entity76			0
' " " but it 's also about that sense of the beauty and simplicity of rural @entity8 life , " he added			0
" when i started scouting @entity8 , the world of the @entity61 films still exists			0
you ride south ; you find yourself in a simple fishing village , and it looks unchanged since the postwar period			0
" depicting the atomic bomb being dropped on @entity73 in " @entity4 , " and the community 's recovery , was a useful allegory for @entity2 's character : " out of all the pain and the catastrophe and loss that he had suffered in his life , he 's in a place that keeps going , " @entity1 said			1
" they keep living , and they keep loving , despite the atrocities that have happened			0
" also on the list of @entity108 's top films of all time is 1947 's @entity114 - set " @entity113 , " about a group of nuns establishing a convent			1
it was an influence on one of his most acclaimed films , " girl , interrupted			0
" " in regards to ' girl , interrupted , ' it 's a conscribed universe with these women all trapped in one place , " @entity1 said			1
" but in ' @entity4 , ' it 's the tone , which is both realistic and dreamy , the sense of travel to the exotic land and the buried sensuality in this new place			1
" @entity1 planted one shot as a direct homage to " @entity113 " in " @entity4 " : when a woman runs out of a building and seems on the verge of throwing herself over a cliff into the sea			1
" that 's from the final sequence of ' @entity113 , ' " @entity1 said , " from when the nun who goes mad is chasing @entity141 around and they show downward with the cliffs			2
" on the @entity144 , @entity1 cites two classics : 1953 's " @entity146 " and @entity14 's 1976 film " @entity9			1
" " ' @entity146 ' is because of the dark outlaw who is brought into town , comes into a new village and changes everyone 's lives but can never stay , " @entity1 said			2
" he 's a soldier of fortune , a vagabond			0
@entity71 is like that @entity45 hero , a man who can never stop moving			0
" in " @entity9 , " @entity14 's character loses his wife and children in the very beginning , and it sets him off on a journey built on his rage and loss -- which echoes not just in @entity71 's loss of @entity164 but the perceived loss of his mentor , dr. @entity167 , seemingly destroyed by the @entity38			0
" it 's also the journey , " @entity1 said , " and how the enemy is not clear			2
it 's kind of a labyrinth			0
and it 's also about a wounded soldier trying to get home again			0
in the end of ' @entity11 , ' it 's not like he 's victorious against any enemy			0
he just literally finds a new place to live and love again and the courage to do it			0
" then , of course , there are the samurai films such as the " @entity183 " : 1954 's " samurai i : @entity185 , " 1955 's " samurai ii : duel at @entity188 " and 1956 's " @entity189 : duel at @entity190			2
" " the imagery is incredibly fantastical , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's not the kind of desolation you 'd find in the @entity197 films			2
they 're extremely lyrical and colorful , with beautiful sets , beautiful design , beautiful use of color			0
" two films noir are also on @entity108 's list : @entity206 's 1971 thriller " @entity207 " and @entity209 's 1974 neo-noir " @entity208			1
" @entity1 said he values all of the films even beyond the inspiration they provided for his latest project			1
" all of these movies are huge to me anyway , " he said			0
" and they spoke to me as i was working on the script and preparing for this shoot			0
but they 've been touchstones to me all my life			0

@entity1 's latest film is " @entity4 "
the director said he was influenced by a wide array of films
@entity108 drew from westerns to noir in making " @entity4 "
