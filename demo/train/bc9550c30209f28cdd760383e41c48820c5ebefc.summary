@entity1 , @entity0 -- it has been nearly eight years since @entity5 forces overthrew the @entity7 leaders of @entity0 , but the war against the @entity7 insurgency is bloodier than ever			1
a @entity5 soldier takes his position near a building attacked by the @entity7 south of @entity1 , @entity0 , on monday			1
the number of @entity0 civilians killed in the wake of the war has increased 24 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same time period last year , according to the @entity18			1
and @entity19 and @entity5 forces suffered record losses this summer , with 75 troops killed in the month of july , making it the deadliest month for @entity24 troops in the country since @entity5 warplanes first began bombing the @entity7 in october 2001			1
the @entity5 death toll will remain high for some time as the @entity7 has gained the upper hand , gen. @entity27 , the top @entity5 commander in @entity0 , told @entity30 in an interview published monday			1
" it 's a very aggressive enemy right now , " @entity27 told the newspaper in the interview saturday at his office in @entity1 , @entity0			1
" we 've got to stop their momentum , stop their initiative			0
" the @entity7 insurgency has blossomed in northern @entity0 provinces such as @entity44 and @entity45 , long considered some of the safest territory in the country			1
and just 20 miles east of @entity1 , @entity7 " judges " operate openly in the back of pickup trucks , settling legal disputes between villagers in makeshift " mobile courts			1
" the insurgents are filling a vacuum left by @entity0 's @entity24 - backed government , which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede suffers from nepotism , corruption and predatory practices			1
challenge to the @entity0 government @entity0 will go to the polls on august 20 to vote in the nation 's second presidential election since the fall of the @entity7 regime in 2001			1
opposition candidates have blamed the @entity7 insurgency 's continued growth on @entity72 , the man who has occupied the presidential palace in @entity1 for the past seven years			1
" because of the failure of the current administration , in losing the support of its own people , there is a vacuum , and that vacuum has led to a deterioration of security as well as in all parts of life , " said @entity72 's top challenger , former foreign minister @entity74			0
@entity27 , a former @entity5 joint special operations commander who recently took command of the @entity5 - @entity19 operation in @entity0 , said the @entity7 are challenging the very legitimacy of his partners in the @entity0 government			1
" the fundamental conflict in any insurgency is fighting for legitimacy with the people and the support of the population , " he explained in a recent interview with @entity2			0
" who do they look to as their legitimate government ? who do they pay taxes to ? who do they look to for rule of law ? who do they look to as protection ? in the case of this insurgency , what we have is an @entity0 government that is trying to establish itself around the country			1
it has problems with corruption			0
it has problems in some cases with predatory behavior			0
" along the traffic - choked streets of @entity1 , residents rarely complain about the @entity7			1
instead , they often rail against the @entity24 - backed @entity0 state			1
" what service has this government provided us ? " asked @entity127 , a young street vendor who sells watermelons for 20 cents apiece			0
he said that at least once a week , @entity0 police show up and demand bribes of up to $ 100 from vendors , who must pay if they want to continue selling their goods			1
" we do n't want a tyrant who oppresses the people , " @entity127 said when asked who he would vote for in the elections			0
" what we want is security			0
" earlier this month , an @entity0 employee for @entity2 , who prefers not to be named for security reasons , witnessed how locals turn to the @entity7 to resolve their disputes , in a village barely 20 miles east of the @entity0 capital			1
he said openly armed insurgents rolled up in a pickup truck , and a @entity7 judge began mediating local disputes			1
in one case , the @entity7 official resolved a disagreement between two shepherds whose flocks of sheep had gotten intermixed while grazing			2
" i was shocked , " said the @entity0 eyewitness , who was visiting the village to attend a funeral			2
" the villagers were lining up asking for help from the @entity7			2
" @entity19 commanders say they have had reports of @entity7 " mobile courts " operating in similar fashion just outside the southern city of @entity169			2
" there are cases of rule of law being taken care of by the @entity7 instead of the @entity0 government , " said col. @entity170 , a @entity171 military spokesman at @entity172			1
he said the @entity7 are operating mobile courts as close as possible to the city of @entity169			2
@entity0 corruption at the highest levels ? human rights activists accuse the @entity72 government of making deals with some of the country 's most notorious warlords ahead of the august 20 presidential elections			1
" a lot of @entity0 are telling us they 're quite disappointed that @entity72 's not even running on a platform of promises or performance , but just an old fashioned @entity0 cutting of deals , " said @entity188 of @entity189			2
he pointed to a recent article by @entity198 , in the @entity200 , that describes @entity72 's choice of @entity202 , a former @entity203 militia commander , as vice presidential running mate			0
@entity202 has long been accused of committing human rights abuses			0
" starting on the top and bringing @entity202 back , this is horrific , " @entity188 said			0
he lamented that @entity0 politicians are rarely prosecuted for crimes , and if they are , they are often pardoned			1
" @entity72 has really regressed over the past seven or eight years , " @entity188 said			0
many @entity0 observers argue this culture of impunity runs directly to the presidential palace			2
for years , @entity72 's brother , @entity214 , has been dogged by accusations that he is a major player in the booming drug trade in southern @entity0			1
one high - ranking @entity24 diplomat stationed in @entity1 described discussing the allegations with @entity72 in a one - on - one meeting			2
@entity72 asked for advice on how best to address his brother 's alleged illicit business dealings , the diplomat said			0
at one point , the diplomat said , @entity72 looked up helplessly , asking , " he 's my brother			0
what can i do ? " both @entity72 and his brother have repeatedly dismissed the allegations as politically motivated			0
this month , @entity72 made a rare trip outside his presidential palace to woo voters in @entity232			0
he conceded that @entity0 is still far from stable , but promised that if re-elected he would redouble his efforts to rebuild the country			2
" terrorism is still harassing us			0
it is still killing us			0
it is still destroying this land , " he told a crowd of several thousand supporters			0
" the moment i become the president of @entity0 -- again -- through your vote , through your able hands , my first attempt will be to ensure perpetual peace			2
" several days later , at a press conference with @entity72 , the newly appointed secretary general of the @entity19 military alliance , @entity251 , called for @entity19 countries to contribute more troops to support the @entity0 government			2
" @entity258 is here to protect your elections , " the former @entity256 prime minister said at @entity1 's presidential palace			2
" what we need are credible elections that reflect the will of the people			0
" @entity258 -- the @entity258 -- is the @entity18 - mandated @entity5 - @entity19 presence in @entity0			1
@entity5 needs a strong @entity0 partner president @entity269 's administration has committed more resources and troops to battling the insurgency and training @entity0 security forces , while also sending additional diplomats and civilian aid workers to focus on reconstruction and development			1
when @entity269 took office , he vowed to redirect military resources from the war in @entity281 to @entity0 , which he described as being -- along with neighboring @entity283 -- the " central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism			1
" @entity27 told @entity30 that he is still considering a request to send 10,000 more troops to @entity0 in addition to the planned 68,000 troops that are expected to be in place by the end of the year			2
the information is a preview of a strategic assessment he plans to deliver to @entity299 later this month			0
the military initiative is an effort to bolster @entity0 's weak government , which many @entity0 observers argue has been , more than anything , a source of frustration and popular disappointment			0
" if the same trend continues , if the same failing of the administration continues , more troops , more resources , more civilian advisors will not be a substitute , " argued presidential candidate @entity74			0
security will be on the minds of most @entity0 voters as they head to the polls , according to @entity319 , the @entity320 - @entity0 head of @entity321 , @entity0 's most influential tv channel			1
" people are frustrated with things not happening , " @entity319 said			0
" in terms of day - to - day life , the development that they wanted in government has not been happening			0
" " they are looking at being able to walk down the street at night without ... risking getting attacked , et cetera			0
they want to make sure that their kids do n't get kidnapped			0
