@entity0 -- @entity3 's personal motto is , " no fear -- give 110 % " -- and he certainly lives up to it			1
despite having broken his neck in a 300 - foot cliff fall that killed one of his friends , the 41 - year - old @entity6 is a legendary figure in the brutal @entity14 sport of wheelchair rugby -- or " murderball " as it was originally named			1
teams are 12 - strong but only four wheelchair athletes are allowed at any time on the court , which is similar to a basketball space , with the basic aim of crossing into the scoring zone at either end while carrying the ball			2
contact between wheelchairs is allowed -- and frequent -- while players often get tipped out of their chairs as the action is fast and furious			0
@entity3 , who took up the sport in 1993 , is one of its leading players and has the scars to boot			1
he had to have his neck realigned in 2004 , ripped his left tricep in 2008 and last year separated his right shoulder			2
he has been @entity36 many times at major international competitions with @entity6 , including the 2002 world championships in @entity39 , where he led his country to the gold medal			1
@entity6 won a bronze medal when wheelchair rugby was introduced to the @entity14 in 1996 as an exhibition sport , and then placed fourth when it gained full status at the @entity46			1
silver and bronze medals have followed in @entity49 and @entity50 for @entity3 and his teammates			2
broken neck @entity3 was brought up in @entity53 and played " pretty much any sport imaginable , " including ice hockey , baseball and football			1
but in february 1987 came the accident which was to leave him in a wheelchair			2
out with friends , tragedy struck when they fell down a 300 - foot cliff			2
one died , the other suffered severe injuries , and @entity3 broke his neck			1
determined not to let his disability curtail his sporting activities , @entity3 initially took up wheelchair basketball and road hockey , but it was a meeting with @entity71 , one of the @entity6 founders of wheelchair rugby , which changed his life			1
" he got me to come out , hit my first guy -- knocked him out of his chair -- and have n't looked back since , " @entity3 told @entity1 's human to @entity77			2
that was in 1993 , when he was 23 , and he has now been competing at the top level for nearly 20 years			0
@entity84 rivalry for much of that period , @entity6 's players have been battling with their neighbors in the @entity88 for global supremacy in wheelchair rugby			1
in the five world championships held since 1995 , the @entity88 has come out on top four times , with @entity6 's 2002 triumph in @entity94 breaking that chain			1
but the most recent championships on home courts in @entity98 saw @entity3 and his teammates back in fifth spot			0
despite that setback , he still relishes the competition , particularly against the @entity88			0
" there 's definitely a little bit of rivalry there because the @entity88 has been ranked number one for many , many years , " he said			0
" there 's definitely a rivalry because we want to be there , and being such close neighbors we compete against each other a lot			0
" but with the growing popularity of the sport , other countries are muscling in on the medal action			0
golden dream heading into the @entity120 in @entity0 , which begin in late august two weeks after the @entity122 finish , @entity3 believes that the destination of the gold medal is no foregone conclusion , despite the traditional @entity88 domination			1
" now , it 's anybody 's game			0
in these @entity122 you actually do n't know who 's going to win , " he said			0
the result of the @entity14 test event in @entity0 last month would appear to back up @entity3 's assertion , with @entity135 beating hosts @entity136 in the final			1
@entity6 claimed the bronze medal , beating @entity39 , but all the matches were close and high - scoring affairs			1
in the likely autumn of his outstanding career , @entity3 is desperate to add gold to his collection , having come so close in @entity49 and @entity50			1
" i 've always enjoyed rugby but my ultimate is to go for that gold , " he said			0
" that helps motivate me , makes me train harder , makes us go out six or seven days a week and try to be in the best shape we can be and ready to go out there and pound some chairs			0
" sporting philosophy as @entity3 's motto suggests , he is not an athlete who leaves anything on the court			0
" i try to give 110 % no matter what i do , whether it 's writing a paper or trying to hit a guy ... you know ? it 's give it all you got , whenever you can			0
" despite his uncompromising attitude , @entity3 has made many friends off the court , even among his @entity84 rivals			2
" we do go out and have a drink or social after wards with the guys , but when it 's on the court , it 's game on ! "			0
