prosecutors say he believed he had a duty to kill as many soldiers as possible			2
his lawyers say he is trying to help the prosecution put him to death			2
for his part , @entity8 maj. @entity7 has said little during his death penalty trial , other than to say he was the shooter in the @entity12 , @entity13 , rampage that left 13 people dead			1
with the prosecution expected to rest this week , the big question is whether the @entity8 psychiatrist will take the stand , perhaps more eager to prove he is a martyr than to avoid a death sentence			2
@entity7 is acting as his own attorney at his court - martial , defending himself against 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in connection with the november 5 , 2009 , attack			1
@entity7 left no doubt about his role , telling a panel of 13 officers during a brief opening statement : " the evidence will clearly show that i am the shooter			1
" " the evidence presented with this trial will show one side			2
the evidence will also show that i was on the wrong side			2
i then switched sides , " he said			0
he 's also left little question about why he did it , repeatedly saying before the trial started that he was acting to protect @entity45 leaders in @entity46 from the @entity48 military			2
" we mujahedeen are trying to establish the perfect religion , " he told the panel last week			0
but , @entity7 added , " i apologize for the mistakes i made in this endeavor			1
" @entity7 , 42 , has previously indicated that he intends to call himself and two witnesses to the stand			1
if he testifies , @entity7 is expected to discuss religious justification for his actions			1
" he is trying to become a martyr , trying to be executed for his crime , " @entity59 legal analyst @entity58 has said of @entity7 's defense strategy , adding that it amounted to a " form of suicide by judge			1
" @entity7 refused to enter a plea at the outset of the court - martial after a judge barred him from pleading guilty			1
under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases			1
last week , @entity7 released a portion of his mental health evaluation to the @entity78 that revealed he believes that being put to death would allow him to become a martyr			1
" i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life			0
however , if i died by lethal injection i would still be a martyr , " @entity7 told a military panel evaluating whether he was fit to stand trial , according to documents published by the @entity78			1
@entity7 has been confined to a wheelchair since being shot by @entity12 police			1
he is paralyzed from the chest down			0
the release of the documents , coupled with @entity7 's lack of an appearance of a defense , prompted military attorneys ordered to act as his stand - by counsel to demand they be allowed to drop off of the case			1
the attorneys said they believe @entity7 is trying to help the prosecution obtain a death sentence			1
the judge , col. @entity102 , refused to grant the request , and the defense attorneys have since appealed her ruling			0
" we believe your order is causing us to violate our professional ethics			0
it 's morally repugnant to us as defense counsel , " lt. col. @entity109 , head of @entity7 's legal team , told the judge			1
a @entity48 - born citizen of @entity115 descent , @entity7 was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the @entity8 in 1997			1
but he had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military , saying he had been taunted by people after the september 11 terror attacks			2
prosecutors hope to show that the devout @entity121 had undergone a " progressive radicalization , " going so far as to give academic presentations in defense of suicide bombings			0
@entity7 , who was scheduled to deploy to @entity46 , did not want to fight against other @entity121 and believed " that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " said lead prosecutor col. @entity129			1
investigations following the shooting rampage found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity133 , the @entity48 born cleric who officials say became a key member of @entity136			0
he was killed in @entity48 drone strike in 2011			0
the prosecution has sought to enter the communications with @entity133 into evidence as well as materials about @entity7 's alleged interest in the action of @entity8 sgt. @entity144 , a @entity48 soldier who was sentenced to death for killing two soldiers in a grenade attack in @entity148 at the start of the invasion of @entity151			1
while the judge deferred a decision on the requests , she has ruled that prosecutors may use evidence of @entity7 's internet searches on jihad and the @entity45 in the days and hours before the attack			1
@entity12 victims : sons , a daughter , a mother - to - be @entity7 has listened impassively as survivors and investigators have testified , painting a horrific picture of what unfolded during the shooting inside the @entity170 as soldiers and civilians prepared to leave for @entity46 and @entity151			1
dozens of witnesses , primarily soldiers , testified that @entity7 specifically targeted uniformed personnel			1
@entity8 staff sgt. @entity176 , the first survivor to take the stand , recounted how the gunman rose from a chair in the processing center , shouted " @entity181 " -- @entity182 for @entity183 is great , pulled out a pistol and began shooting			0
" it was a state of panic , " @entity176 said			0
as @entity176 was checking behind him , " @entity7 is turning the weapon on me , " he said			1
" he has a laser on his weapon and it goes across my line of sight and i blink			0
in that time , he discharges his weapon			0
the first round , i 'm hit in the head			0
" a second shot caught @entity176 in the back			0
he decided to play dead for a while before changing his mind and deciding to run for the door			0
he made it out of the building but was shot five more times outside , he testified			0
capt. @entity204 , who was her final checkup ahead of her deployment , testified that she initially believed the shooting was part of a military exercise			2
then he heard pvt. @entity210 screaming , " my baby , my baby " as she cradled her stomach			0
she crawled to the pregnant @entity214 and tried to comfort her , telling the 21 - year - old private that it would be ok and that the training exercise would end soon			0
@entity214 and her unborn baby died in the attack			2
@entity204 told the court she suffered four gunshot wounds : one that grazed her head ; another through her right hip ; a third lodged in her right leg ; and a fourth in the abdomen			2
chief warrant officer @entity226 , 41 , stared down at @entity7 from the stand , where he testified how he charged the gunman to try to stop him and how @entity7 shot him			1
days before he took the stand , @entity226 told @entity59 that he had forgiven @entity7			2
" i ca n't hold that grudge , " @entity226 said			0
" it 's just too much			0
i wo n't allow him to consume any more energy for my life than he has already done , and so i have released him			0
" i have forgiven him completely , " he said			0
" it 's not up to me to punish him			0
