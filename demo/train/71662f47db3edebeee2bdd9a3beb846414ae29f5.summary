@entity0 -- a graffiti vandal hit the home owned by @entity5 's father and a neighboring home in @entity7 friday -- days after the filmmaker 's curse - filled rant against the gentrification enveloping his old neighborhood			1
the glass was shattered on the front door of the neighbor 's home on @entity19 in the @entity21 section , and " @entity22 , " the title of @entity5 's controversial 1989 film about racial tension in @entity7 , was spray - painted on the wall along with the @entity24 , the symbol for anarchy			1
three words -- " @entity22 " -- were scrawled on stairs leading to jazz artist @entity30 's brownstone next door			1
a police spokesman said the home was spray - painted early friday			1
the act of vandalism is being investigated			2
@entity37 , who has lived in the neighborhood for 17 years , said she discovered the vandalism on her @entity19 home friday morning			1
she believes the damage is connected to @entity5 's now - infamous anti-gentrification rant during an @entity44 lecture on tuesday			1
" all i know is that he made a lot of comments that went viral , the next day my house is vandalized , " @entity37 told @entity1			1
" there is probably some kind of connection in the mind of whoever did this ... there is no reasonable reason for it			2
if this person has got something to say , fine say it			0
do n't damage my property			0
" @entity61 , who lives with his father , defended his half - brother 's right to rant about gentrification but took issue with @entity5 's reference to the family 's @entity21 home			1
" say what you want but leave the personal stuff out of it , " he told @entity1 friday			0
" the moment you start going , ' well , i live here , ' and he does n't live here			0
you know he lives in @entity76 so ... this is my dad 's house , and it 's kind of personal			1
" he added , " leave us out of it			0
because i feel bad ... my neighbor , she is a good friend			1
in his rant , in which @entity5 mentioned that he once lived at 165 @entity19 , @entity5 also said his father , " a great jazz musician , " bought the brownstone 46 years ago			1
" and the mother * * * * * * ' people moved in last year and called the cops on my father , " @entity5 said			1
he 's not â € ” he does n't even play electric bass			1
we bought the mother * * * * * * ' house in 1968 , and now you call the cops ? in 2013 ? " according to a @entity101 article , police have received 17 noise complaints			1
the @entity101 said a woman who lived next door had called most			0
@entity61 does n't believe the vandalism was connected to the noise complaints			2
" if it came from what he said , then it came from that , " he said " but there has n't been a noise complaint in months			0
" @entity37 , a retired computer programmer , said she was not behind the noise complaints			0
" they are professional musicians next door , " she said			0
they jam and their music is very good			0
i never had problems with the noise at all			0
and i was quoted in the paper saying that , and i never brought complaints			0
maybe this has something to do with that			0
if it does , they got the wrong house			2
" @entity37 , a retired computer programmer , said she is not concerned for her safety			0
" we do n't have this kind of thing happening in this neighborhood , " she said			0
" and that is upsetting in a way ... i do n't think it 's necessarily going to happen again			2
" @entity37 said @entity21 has always been vibrant and diverse , with many longtime home owners			2
" it 's always been a very mixed neighborhood , racially , culturally , socially , " she said			2
" it 's retained that identity			2
it 's also been a neighborhood that attracts a lot of people from the arts			2
i do n't think that the flavor of the neighborhood has changed			0
the people in it have changed , and where they come from maybe			0
a lot of people from @entity160 , people from @entity157 , we have people from all over in @entity21			0
" in his speech tuesday at @entity7 's @entity163 , @entity5 vented his feelings about newcomers now inhabiting once - blighted parts of @entity168 's most populous city			1
" and why does it take an influx of white @entity0 in the @entity171 , in @entity172 , in @entity173 , in @entity174 for the facilities to get better ? the garbage was n't picked up every mother * * * * * * * day when i was living in 165 @entity19			1
... the police were n't around			0
when you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers , three o'clock in the morning on @entity183 , that must tell you something			0
" on wednesday , @entity5 told " @entity190 " that he 's not against new people moving into areas that were once predominantly poor and predominantly @entity189			1
" my problem is that when you move into a neighborhood , have some respect for the history , for the culture , " @entity5 said			1
not just @entity5 's @entity7 @entity1 's @entity197 contributed to this report .			1
