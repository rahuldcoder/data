-- this week 's bitter budget showdown in @entity2 is n't the first time state legislators have fled a state , left a building or refused to show when votes were called			1
the " @entity10 " and the " @entity7 11 , " for example , skedaddled from @entity7 in 2003 to prevent consideration of a redistricting bill			1
in 1839 , a young @entity12 , serving as a @entity13 in the @entity14 , jumped out of the building in a futile bid to prevent @entity17 from getting a quorum to vote on a banks bill			1
members of the 1891 @entity22 @entity21 went to @entity23 in a bid to prevent a quorum for the election of a @entity28 senator			1
and in 1994 , @entity30 members of the @entity31 refused to show up for floor sessions in an effort to prevent @entity17 from electing @entity34 as speaker with less than a majority vote			1
the walkout by @entity17 senators in @entity2 , preventing a vote quorum on the contentious budget bill , can be added to a string of what might appear to be extreme actions to make a point			1
" we have a very diverse society , " said @entity45 , director of the @entity46 at the @entity47			0
" legislatures are where public policies are fought out			0
by nature , it is a messy process			0
" @entity45 , who posted an item friday about walkouts on the conference 's @entity58 blog , told @entity0 that " most states have rules to compel attendance of members			1
" @entity64 gov. @entity64 said he is trying to address a $ 137 million shortfall in the state budget			2
he wants public employees to pay more for their benefits , and he wants to eliminate most of their collective bargaining rights			0
@entity64 called on 14 @entity17 lawmakers to return to the state @entity71 to vote on the measure friday			1
most or all of them traveled to neighboring @entity76			0
" you ca n't operate a democracy if people do n't show up , " he said			1
@entity30 lawmakers asked the governor to send state troopers to look for @entity17 @entity21 leader @entity84 , but he was not found , @entity0 affiliate @entity80 reported friday			1
although he might have the votes to pass the bill in the legislature , the problem for @entity64 is getting a quorum in the @entity21			1
the defecting lawmakers say they wo n't return until @entity64 agrees to negotiate with a teachers union on the governor 's proposals to reduce the state 's budget deficit by cutting benefits for its members			1
they also want language removed from the bill that critics say threatens the existence of all public employee unions in the state			2
@entity106 16 states that " members of the senate may not be absent from the daily session during the entire day without first obtaining a leave of absence			2
the leave may be granted at any time by a majority vote of the senate			2
" it 's hardly new for members of minority parties to find ways to stymie legislation			0
" the rules and procedures generally provide that the majority rules , but [ also ] protect minority rights , " said @entity45 , whose duties include public education and outreach			0
lawmakers can filibuster in some , but not all , states			2
they can also utilize certain bill passage requirements and a governor 's veto , said @entity45 , who took no stance on the @entity2 situation			1
in most state legislatures , a quorum to do business constitutes a simple majority of the members , @entity45 wrote			2
but in @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity7 , two - thirds of the members make up a quorum , and in @entity2 , three - fifths of the members are required to act on budget and tax bills , making it easier to thwart a bill			1
the most famous recent walkout was by @entity7 @entity17 in 2003 , who as the " @entity10 " and " @entity152 " fled to @entity154 and @entity155 to deny a quorum on a redistricting measure pushed by @entity30			1
@entity158 , president of the @entity2 chapter of the @entity160 , called the lawmakers ' decision to skip town " courageous			0
" " the same could be said of the @entity21 , " @entity158 told @entity0			0
" a small minority continues to constantly filibuster every piece of legislation and bring that body to standstill			0
we do n't have a filibuster here in @entity2			2
" the only thing these brave senators could do was to leave the state so that they could not be forced or compelled to bring a quorum to the body , " @entity158 said			0
" they stood up for worker rights			0
" but @entity64 called on the absent lawmakers to return " out of respect for the institution of the legislature and the democratic process			0
" @entity45 says the conference helps to make legislators and legislatures share ideas and be more effective			0
" the public looks at legislatures , and all they see is bickering , which has a negative connotation , " he said			0
" negotiation and compromise are essential in a democratic society			0
