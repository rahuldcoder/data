a respiratory virus that has sent hundreds of children to hospitals in @entity3 is causing alarm across the @entity5 and beyond			1
ten states have contacted the @entity7 for help investigating clusters of the virus that 's being blamed for the illness			2
list of states with the @entity14 health officials say they 're still figuring out what 's going on			2
the bug that appears to be causing most of the concern has a typically arcane name -- @entity21 - @entity20 -- but many of its symptoms are very common			1
here 's what you need to know about the virus			2
what are enteroviruses ? enteroviruses , which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold , are n't unusual			1
they 're actually very common			1
when you have a bad summer cold , often what you have is an enterovirus , said @entity37 , a virologist and director of the @entity7 's @entity39			1
there are more than 100 types of enteroviruses causing about 10 to 15 million infections in the @entity44 each year , according to the @entity7			1
they are carried in the intestinal tract and often spread to other parts of the body			2
the season often hits its peak in september , as summer ends and fall begins			2
why @entity14 infections are difficult to track so why all the concern now ? what 's unusual at the moment is the high number of hospitalizations			1
the virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a @entity63 , @entity3 , hospital , where about 15 % of the youngsters were placed in intensive care , officials said			1
" it 's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care			1
i would call it unprecedented , " said dr. @entity71 , a director for infectious diseases at @entity73 , where about 475 children were recently treated			2
" i 've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics , and i 've never seen anything quite like this , " she said			0
what parents should know about @entity21 - @entity20 what 's special about this particular type of enterovirus ? an analysis by the @entity7 showed at least 30 of the @entity63 children tested positive for @entity86 , @entity3 health officials said			0
it 's a type of enterovirus that 's uncommon , but not new			1
it was first identified in the 1960s and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time			0
but it 's possible , @entity37 said , that the relatively low number of reports might be because @entity86 is hard to identify			0
@entity86 was seen last year in the @entity44 and this year in various parts of the world			1
over the years , clusters have been reported in @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and various countries including the @entity103 , @entity104 and the @entity105			0
experts say they do n't know why it 's flared up this time around			0
" why one virus or another crops up in one part of the country or another part of the country from one year to the next is inexplicable , " said @entity108 , head of the @entity109 at @entity110			1
" it 's a mystery to me			0
" what are the symptoms ? the virus can start as just a cold			1
signs include coughing , difficulty breathing and in some cases a rash			0
sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing			0
respiratory problems appear to the hallmark of @entity86 , according to the @entity3 @entity133 and senior services			1
" most enteroviruses cause either a little bit of a cold or a diarrheal illness -- a few cause meningitis , " said @entity108			1
" this one is the , if you will , odd cousin			0
it causes prominent respiratory symptoms			1
why it does that , we 're really not sure			0
" how serious is it ? the good news is that enteroviruses usually are n't deadly			1
" all of these folks are going to get better , " said @entity108			0
" some of them have more severe illness , such as these children who have developed asthma and are hospitalized			0
but they should all get better			0
" many of the @entity86 infections " will be mild and self - limited , requiring only symptomatic treatment , " the @entity3 health agency said			1
some cases could , in theory , contribute to death , but none of the @entity3 cases have resulted in death and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the @entity44 , the agency said			1
how widespread are the cases ? beyond the surge in infections in @entity3 , there are signs of a possible regional outbreak of @entity86			2
@entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 are reporting cases with similar symptoms and are awaiting testing results , according to officials and @entity183 affiliates in those states			2
the 10 states that have reached out to the @entity7 for assistance are @entity175 , @entity187 , @entity99 , @entity177 , @entity188 , @entity176 , @entity3 , @entity63 , @entity189 , and @entity190			0
the unusually high number of hospitalizations reported now could be " just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases , " said @entity37 of the @entity7			0
what can be done to prevent it ? like other enteroviruses , the respiratory illness appears to spread through close contact with infected people			1
that makes children more susceptible			0
there 's not a great deal you can do , health officials say , beyond taking commonsense steps to reduce the risk			0
wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds -- particularly after going to the bathroom and changing diapers			0
clean and disinfect surfaces that are regularly touched by different people , such as toys and doorknobs			2
avoid shaking hands , kissing , hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick			2
and stay home if you feel unwell			0
there 's no vaccine for @entity86 .			0

@entity228 is uncommon but not new
it causes prominent respiratory symptoms , like a cold but worse
people suffering from the disease should all get better , an expert says
enteroviruses are very common , causing up to 15 million infections a year in the @entity44
