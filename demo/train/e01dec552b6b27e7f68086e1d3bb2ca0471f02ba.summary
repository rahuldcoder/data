-- recently , we learned two important things about @entity3			2
first , he would rather see the @entity6 economy fail than president @entity8 win			1
second , the extent of his hypocrisy is amazing			0
while he laments the toll that outsourcing has taken on our workers and economy , he amassed a fortune by investing in companies that outsourced @entity6 jobs			2
in word and deed , @entity3 roots for failure , and his insincerity reveals a disdain for the common good and disregard for people 's common sense			1
as @entity29 reported , @entity3 urged @entity31 gov. @entity30 to downplay good economic news in the @entity31			1
it 's his way of sending a signal to @entity36 governors in states where the economy is improving -- in the battlegrounds of @entity40 , @entity41 and elsewhere -- to be quiet			1
obscure the truth , he begs			0
but these governors know better			0
@entity30 continues to tout @entity31 's economic recovery , as he should			0
@entity40 gov. @entity46 notes that the state 's 5.6 % unemployment is the lowest in three years -- in other words , it 's been falling since @entity8 's policies took effect			2
@entity41 is another key state where the facts contradict @entity3 's scorched - earth message			1
following the president 's recent @entity55 speech , @entity3 urged residents to " look around @entity41 " to see the impact of @entity8 's policies			1
so let 's take him up on it			0
@entity41 's unemployment rate fell from 10.6 % to 7.5 % in three years			0
a main reason is the resurgent auto industry , which the president rescued but @entity3 opposed -- an undeniable success that @entity41 's @entity66 gov. @entity66 still tries to downplay			1
by all means , @entity36 governors should take credit for the economic turnarounds in their states			1
but give credit where credit is due			0
states are not islands unto themselves			0
their economies are intertwined with that of other states , and with the nation 's economy as a whole			2
some states went into the @entity84 faster than others ; some went in deeper			0
but all were sucked into the same economic abyss of the failed policies of the past -- the same policies , by the way , that @entity3 promises to repeat as president			1
similarly , some states have climbed out of recession faster , some further , but all have been pulled up by the president 's policies that are moving us forward			2
while we 're far from a full recovery , " we 're all in this together ; we rise and fall as one nation and as one people , " as the president says			0
what we 're seeing from @entity3 as the leader of his party is the worst and most predictable kind of politics			0
@entity108 senate leader @entity108 has said his party 's top priority is to defeat @entity8			2
not to get our economy going again			0
but to win an election			0
his troops have carried out that mission in lockstep			0
congressional republicans have stalled , slow - walked or stopped everything -- even blocking the president 's jobs plan , which addresses the most important issues in the country and is full of bipartisan ideas that would create as many as 1 million new jobs for our teachers , police officers , firefighters and construction workers			2
another part of the president 's jobs plan would create tax incentives to reward companies that bring jobs back to @entity6 rather than those that send them overseas			1
but we 're unlikely to see @entity3 start showing any signs of leadership now			2
in a major report from the @entity142 , we learned that @entity3 's corporate buyout firm bought companies that specialized in outsourcing			1
he made a fortune helping companies send @entity6 jobs to @entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 , maximizing profits for himself and his investors while laying off @entity6 workers , gutting companies and devastating communities here at home			0
if @entity3 really supports @entity6 jobs as strongly as his stump speech suggests , he 'd stand up to members of his @entity36 and encourage them to pass the president 's jobs plan			1
if that 's a bridge too far , perhaps he 'd consider coming up with a jobs plan of his own			0
as former @entity163 official @entity162 said , " president @entity8 has a plan for dealing with our cyclical unemployment crisis , " but @entity3 does not			1
even worse , according to @entity169 professor and former @entity8 budget official @entity170 's op - ed in @entity172 , @entity3 's ideas " would slow the recovery , reversing the gains we have made since the recession ended			1
" which is why @entity3 is trying to convince voters of two impossible contradictions simultaneously			0
one , that the national economy is lousy , but state and local economies are improving			0
and two , that if an economy has improved , it 's only because of @entity36 efforts and in spite of the president 's leadership			1
economists disagree , and even @entity36 governors refuse to play along with @entity3 's games			1
@entity3 's detachment from , or denial of , the truth is not just a political tactic or say - anything - to - please character flaw			1
it reveals a lack of leadership			2
it reveals an elemental attitude he shares with the special interest super pacs that support him -- silence the truth , show indifference to the hardship of others and sow distrust of the @entity6 people 's belief in the common good and common sense			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity215 : @entity3 would rather see @entity6 economy fail than president @entity8 win
@entity215 : he has urged @entity36 leaders to downplay good economic news in their states
she says @entity6 deserves better than someone who roots for failure
@entity215 : @entity3 's tactic or say - anything - to - please character flaw reveals lack of leadership
