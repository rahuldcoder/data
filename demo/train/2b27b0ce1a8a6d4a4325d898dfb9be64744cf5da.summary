-- although it has been over for nearly a year now , the war in @entity2 continued to be a flash point in monday night 's debate between president @entity5 and his @entity7 challenger , former @entity8 gov. @entity6			1
" you say that you 're not interested in duplicating what happened in @entity2 , " said @entity5 , a @entity9 who opposed the @entity11 - led invasion in 2003			1
" but just a few weeks ago , you said you think we should have more troops in @entity2 right now			0
... you said that we should still have troops in @entity2 to this day			0
" but @entity6 , who supported the invasion , said @entity5 wanted to keep @entity11 troops there longer -- he just could n't get the @entity2 to go along			1
fact check : comparing costs of @entity2 , @entity22 missions " there was an effort on the part of the president to have a @entity27 , and i concurred in that , and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on , " @entity6 said			1
" you thought it should have been 5,000 troops , " he told @entity5			0
" i thought there should have been more troops , but you know what ? the answer was we got no troops through whatsoever			0
" since the nearly nine - year war remains controversial back home , @entity0 is taking a closer look at both candidates ' claims			0
the facts : the @entity27 signed between the @entity11 and @entity2 in 2008 called for @entity11 troops to withdraw from @entity2 cities by 2009 and be out of the country entirely by the end of 2011			1
@entity5 opposed the 2003 invasion of @entity2 while still a state legislator in @entity55 and ran for president on a platform of ending that war			1
but with the 2011 deadline nearing , his administration -- which took office after the agreement was signed -- tried to make arrangements with @entity2 to keep between 3,000 and 5,000 @entity11 in the country to help train @entity2 security forces			2
fact check : @entity5 's apology tour ? " if they want the benefits of what we can provide , if they want the assistance , if they want the training , if they want the operational skills that we can provide , then i think they have to understand that they 've got to give us some protections in that process , " defense secretary @entity68 said in october 2011			0
those talks failed when the @entity2 refused to grant legal immunity for @entity11 troops , and the last @entity11 convoy left @entity2 in december 2011			2
@entity5 touted that as a promise kept , saying @entity11 would be leaving " with their heads held high			2
" the president also has touted that as a promise kept during his re-election campaign			0
but @entity6 has consistently criticized the @entity5 administration for its failure to reach a deal with the @entity2 government on keeping those troops there			1
in december 2011 , with the final pullout looming , @entity6 told @entity99 sunday that the @entity5 administration was ending the @entity11 presence " in a precipitous way , and we should have left 10,000 , 20,000 , 30,000 personnel there to help transition to the @entity2 ' own military capabilities			1
" two weeks before monday night 's debate , in a speech at the @entity108 , @entity6 said the " costly gains " made in @entity2 were slipping away			2
fact check : is @entity113 's core decimated or growing ? " and yet , @entity11 's ability to influence events for the better in @entity2 has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence , " he said			2
" the president tried -- and failed -- to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains			0
" conclusion : each man 's attacks are rooted in fact			0
the @entity5 administration did attempt , unsuccessfully , to extend the presence of a scaled - back @entity11 training mission in @entity2 , while @entity6 has said @entity130 should have kept a considerably larger force in @entity132			1
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity134 @entity0 's @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
