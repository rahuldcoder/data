-- @entity1 has worked as a civil engineer with the @entity3 for the past 24 years , designing air traffic control radar systems that help keep @entity5 moving			1
now he 's got a message for @entity7 : get moving on a plan to save his job			1
@entity1 , a 48 - year - old father of two from the @entity13 area , is one of thousands of @entity14 with ties to the aviation industry who are suddenly finding themselves out of work this summer because of @entity7 's failure to pass routine legislation keeping the @entity3 funded			1
the @entity21 and @entity22 have gone on vacation , leaving @entity1 on furlough			2
he 's had no choice but to file for unemployment , prioritize which bills to pay , and dig into his family 's savings in order to make ends meet			2
" @entity7 does n't care about me at all , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" they 're not done with their work and they go on vacation			2
how do they do that ? " @entity1 says he 's tried to " avoid politics as a rule " his whole life , but now he 's calling his congressman and senators -- to no avail			2
" it 's always somebody else 's fault " when you call their offices , he says			2
" it 's never our fault			2
" the @entity21 adjourned monday after a divisive vote to raise the national debt ceiling , leaving the @entity22 with an @entity3 funding extension bill it did not like and could not amend			1
so the @entity22 recessed tuesday night without doing anything			0
at issue is a decision by rep. @entity59 , a @entity61 @entity60 , to add a provision to the funding extension cutting subsidies to rural airports			2
the measure is opposed by powerful @entity67 such as senate majority leader @entity68 , @entity69			0
there 's also a dispute over provisions that would make it easier for airline employees to unionize			0
@entity67 support the section ; republicans generally oppose it			0
@entity1 and 4,000 other @entity3 employees are stuck in the middle of the dispute			1
but they 're not the only people being hurt			0
the @entity3 has stopped hundreds of airport construction projects nationwide , putting about 24,000 construction workers out of work			1
another 35,000 support workers , such as food service vendors , are also affected , according to the @entity88			1
the @entity3 says the impasse will also prevent the federal government from collecting approximately $ 200 million a week in airline passenger taxes -- or about $ 1.2 billion during the congressional recess			1
other workers caught up in the mess share @entity1 's frustrating and growing anger with @entity7			1
" we 're into the politics of confrontation versus looking out for the interests for constituents , " said @entity96 , a mechanical engineer from @entity97			2
" i 'm really disappointed			0
" he called the situation " unconscionable			0
" @entity96 , 42 , has worked for the @entity3 for 20 years and has a 2 - year - old daughter			1
like @entity1 , he 's digging into his savings			0
he 's also looking for another job			0
@entity106 , 47 , works for the @entity3 in @entity107 , @entity108			1
he 's been with the @entity3 for 18 years , and before that spent five years in the @entity110			1
he has two children , ages 9 and 12			0
" we 're just in shock that ( @entity7 ) actually did not get this done , " he told @entity0			1
" we understand this is politics , but this is just insane			0
" @entity106 said he 's " very upset " @entity7 " did n't think this was important enough to stick around for			1
" he stressed that it 's not just federal workers who are being hurt by the latest @entity122 stalemate			2
" they 're going to put people out of business , " he warned			0
" small companies will go under			0
" @entity127 , 50 , works for the @entity3 in @entity128			1
he helped build the control tower at nearby @entity130 , among other things			0
recently , he and his wife took out a 15 - year home equity loan in order to put a new roof on their house			0
now he 's being forced to use that money to pay his regular bills			0
" it 's almost like there 's a ... dog walking down the road , and he picked up a hand grenade in his mouth and it 's going to go off			0
they do n't even know what they 're doing , " he said in reference to @entity7			1
" who are they ? are they better than us ? " " this is a clear attack on @entity5 , " @entity127 said			1
" this is a punch in the face			0
" @entity0 's @entity158 contributed to this report			0

4,000 aviation workers are being furloughed because @entity7 has n't approved @entity3 funding
thousands of other workers are also affected because of the failure to pass legislation
an @entity3 engineer from @entity13 says , " @entity7 does n't care about me at all "
an @entity3 employee from @entity128 calls the failure to pass a bill a " clear attack on @entity5 "
