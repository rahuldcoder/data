-- conservative critics have launched an attack on @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity3 , who moderated tuesday 's second presidential debate , after she corrected former gov. @entity6 's claim that president @entity7 did not refer to the consulate attack in @entity9 as an " act of terror			1
" @entity0 @entity12 : a day after @entity14 attack , @entity7 described it as ' acts of terror ' @entity7 said in the debate that on september 12 , he called the attack in @entity14 that killed four @entity17 , including @entity17 ambassador @entity18 , an " act of terror			1
" @entity6 , however , disputed the claim , and said the president had not called it an " act of terror " for 14 days			1
@entity3 correctly stated that @entity7 had used the term " act of terror " during remarks at the @entity27 the day after the attack			1
in an editorial on wednesday titled " candy 's not dandy , " the @entity34 -- owned by @entity36 's @entity35 , parent company of @entity37 -- repeated accusations against @entity3 first leveled by @entity6 surrogate @entity39 on @entity0 's @entity40 on wednesday morning			1
" the president was caught lying last night , and i think the world should know that , " @entity39 told @entity0 's @entity41			1
@entity39 contended that @entity7 's comments were in reference to " the original 9/11 event " and not the @entity14 attack			1
however , the transcripts of the debate and also the president 's @entity52 address , as well as subsequent comments , show that , in fact , @entity3 was correct			1
here was the entire exchange from the transcript of the debate : @entity58 : because we 're -- we 're closing in , i want to still get a lot of people in			0
i want to ask you something , mr. president , and then have the governor just quickly			0
your secretary of state , as i 'm sure you know , has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in @entity9			1
does the buck stop with your secretary of state as far as what went on here ? @entity7 : secretary @entity74 has done an extraordinary job			2
but she works for me			0
i 'm the president and i 'm always responsible , and that 's why nobody 's more interested in finding out exactly what happened than i do			2
the day after the attack , governor , i stood in the @entity52 and i told the @entity17 people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened			0
that this was an act of terror and i also said that we 're going to hunt down those who committed this crime			2
and then a few days later , i was there greeting the caskets coming into @entity95 and grieving with the families			0
and the suggestion that anybody in my team , whether the secretary of state , our @entity101 ambassador , anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we 've lost four of our own , governor , is offensive			0
that 's not what we do			0
that 's not what i do as president , that 's not what i do as commander in chief			2
@entity58 : governor , if you want to ... @entity6 : yes , i -- i.			2
. @entity58 : ... quickly to this please			0
@entity6 : i -- i think interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the @entity52 and said that this was an act of terror			1
@entity7 : that 's what i said			2
@entity6 : you said in the @entity52 the day after the attack , it was an act of terror			1
it was not a spontaneous demonstration , is that what you 're saying ? @entity7 : please proceed governor			2
@entity6 : i want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in @entity9 an act of terror			1
@entity7 : get the transcript			2
@entity58 : it -- it -- it -- he did in fact , sir			0
so let me -- let me call it an act of terror ... @entity7 : can you say that a little louder , @entity153 ? @entity58 : he -- he did call it an act of terror			1
it did as well take -- it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out			0
you are correct about that			0
@entity6 : this -- the administration -- the administration indicated this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction			2
@entity6 : it took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group			2
and to suggest -- am i incorrect in that regard , on sunday , the -- your secretary -- @entity7 : candy ? @entity6 : excuse me			1
the ambassador of the @entity101 went on the sunday television shows and spoke about how -- @entity7 : candy , i 'm -- @entity6 : -- this was a spontaneous -- @entity58 : mr. president , let me -- @entity7 : i 'm happy to have a longer conversation -- @entity58 : i know you -- @entity7 : -- about foreign policy			1
but i want to -- i want to move you on and also -- @entity7 : ok			2
i 'm happy to do that , too			0
@entity58 : -- the transcripts and -- @entity7 : i just want to make sure that -- @entity58 : -- figure out what we -- @entity7 : -- all of these wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered ... and here is the transcript from @entity7 's @entity52 remarks on september 12 , the day after the attack : " our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe , " he said			1
" no acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation , alter that character , or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for			0
today we mourn four more @entity17 who represent the very best of the @entity17			0
we will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act			0
and make no mistake , justice will be done			0
" @entity7 repeated the " acts of terror " line during a campaign event in @entity221 on september 13 : " no act of terror will dim the light of the values that we proudly shine on the rest of the world , and no act of violence will shake the resolve of the @entity17			1
" timeline : what the @entity7 administration has said about the @entity14 attack in the debate , @entity3 , who is anchor of @entity0 's " @entity235 , " also said that @entity6 was correct to say that it took the administration some time to say conclusively and with one voice that the attack was not the spontaneous outgrowth of a protest against an anti-islam film			1
@entity58 : he -- he did call it an act of terror			0
it did as well take -- it did as well take two weeks or so for the whole idea there being a riot out there about this tape to come out			0
you are correct about that			0
on september 16 , @entity253 , the @entity17 ambassador to the @entity101 , said , " we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned			0
" on september 19 , @entity258 , director of the @entity259 , told the @entity260 that the ambassador and three other @entity17 " were killed in the course of a terrorist attack on our embassy			0
" but , as to the original accusation from the conservative critics that @entity7 never mentioned " acts of terror " until weeks after the attack , they were wrong			1
complete coverage of @entity0 's @entity271 @entity0 wire staff contributed to this report .			1
