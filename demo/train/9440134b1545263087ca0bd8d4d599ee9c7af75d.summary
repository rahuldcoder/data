@entity0 , @entity1 -- one - third of @entity4 's youth is now overweight or obese , according to the @entity5			2
in @entity0 , @entity1 , 14 - year - old @entity6 no longer wants to be one of those statistics			1
@entity6 has been overweight since she was about 3 years old and as she got older , she just got heavier			1
she told @entity2 her eating habits were to blame			2
" i 'm a junk - food person and because i 'm a couch potato i do n't like to get off the couch , " she said			2
" it 's also kind of just like my genes : both my parents are heavy and that 's just the environment i was raised in			0
" @entity6 said people have stared at her all her life because of her weight			1
" the first thing that goes through their mind is , ' why is she so fat ? ' and , ' @entity21 , she 's so fat			0
why does n't she just hop on a treadmill ? ' and i think people do n't really understand that it 's not just exercising ... it 's extremely hard			0
see @entity6 growing up in pictures " i get self - conscious , " she said			1
" i do n't like to go to crowded places -- like if a mall 's crowded , i 'll sit in the car			0
" the @entity5 says obesity rates for @entity6 's age group , those 12 to 19 years old , have tripled since 1980			1
@entity6 pleaded with her mother to find a doctor who would perform weight - loss surgery on teenagers			1
dr. @entity40 , who started a program for adolescent surgery at @entity43 in @entity44 , said he felt " compelled " to help @entity6			1
" her @entity45 [ body mass index ] , which is a measurement we use to determine how obese someone is , put her in the highest risk category			0
not just morbidly obese but two categories higher than that , " @entity40 said			0
" so i felt that withholding a known therapy that works based on her age alone was really almost unethical			2
" between 2000 and 2003 , some 800 teenagers went under the knife to lose weight , @entity40 said			2
before she was approved for surgery , @entity6 had to meet with a nutritionist , a pediatric cardiologist and a psychologist			1
in the end , @entity6 was approved for an experimental procedure known as a " gastrectomy , " during which about 80 percent of the stomach is removed , including the part of the stomach that controls appetite			1
@entity40 said the procedure " basically restricts the amount of food that can come into the stomach at any one time and it really makes the patient have a sense of fullness or a lack of hunger			1
" @entity6 had the " gastrectomy " last month and already has lost about 45 pounds			1
today she weighs 400 pounds and is down to a size 32			0
@entity6 said she would like one day to be a size 12 but is n't trying to reach a specific weight			1
" it 's not about the numbers ; i want to be at a healthy size , " she said			0
" i want to be able to go into a normal store and buy something and be able to wear it			0
i want to be able to run			0
i have n't been able to run since i was 5 years old			0
i want to be able wear a bathing suit without feeling embarrassed			0
" i just want to be normal			0
" but dr. @entity89 , a @entity90 surgeon who also has helped adolescents lose weight , said surgery for teenagers can be risky			1
he has turned away most teens sent to him for evaluation , he said , and has operated only on those more than 500 pounds with serious health risks such as blood clots and congestive heart failure			2
" adults are a different matter because they are more emotionally mature , " @entity89 said			0
" they know what risks they want to take and they can buy into the procedure			2
kids do n't really know what they 're getting into , so i think you have to be really careful with children before doing these operations on them			0
" @entity89 noted that only a limited number of studies have been done on weight - loss surgery 's effects on teenagers later in life			1
" we do n't really know the full spectrum of positive or negative outcomes for the procedures , " he said			2
@entity40 , who operated on @entity6 , said he fully agrees that " we need to study this more			1
but i do n't think it 's fair to the @entity123 of the world to keep them from having this procedure based on their age alone			1
" in his own study , @entity40 followed 41 teenagers for two years after weight - loss surgery			1
he said they lost half their excess body weight and their health had improved			2
@entity6 said she was well aware of the risks of surgery , but after trying about a dozen different diets , she said , surgery was her only option			1
now , she said , she is well on her way to becoming a healthy teen and adult			0
she works out playing the @entity144 video game and walks every day with her brother after school			0
she is eating a high - protein diet			2
" this surgery is a tool in your tool box to becoming healthy , " she said			2
" it is not the quick fix			0
you need a lot more			0
you need to exercise you need to make the right food choices			0
" in a letter to the insurance company seeking coverage for this procedure , @entity6 wrote she needed this surgery to make it to her 15th birthday			1
she said , " doctors have told me for years that if i keep gaining weight i 'm not going to see 18 and that has terrified me			1
i want to do so many things			0

@entity6 *underwent* weight - loss surgery at age 14
