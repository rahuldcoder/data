@entity0 -- the captain of @entity4 345 , whose nose gear was broken while landing at @entity6 in @entity7 last month , took control of the aircraft from his co-pilot when the plane was below 400 feet -- a critical phase of flight during which control is rarely changed between pilots , experts say			1
the @entity16 on tuesday updated its investigation into the july 22 incident , noting the last - minute cockpit switch but did not reveal the captain 's explanation for the change			1
other details released by the safety board , however , could provide an explanation , pilots contacted by @entity1 said			0
the @entity4 pilots told investigators the wind changed direction as the plane was landing , shifting from an 11 - knot tailwind below 1,000 feet to an 11 - knot headwind on the runway			1
passenger sues airline over @entity6 nose landing the captain took control at a point roughly midway through that period , " at a point below 400 feet , " the @entity16 said			1
the wind shift , experts said , could have caused the plane to deviate from its glide path			1
" this wind shift will most likely be part of the focus of this investigation , " said capt. @entity47 of the @entity48			1
" the captain evidently saw something that concerned him enough that he elected to take control of the aircraft at that time , " @entity47 said			0
" does it happen ? not often			0
does it happen sometimes ? yes , it does			0
" while emphasizing that it is still early in the investigation , pilots consulted by @entity1 said it is unusual for a pilot to take control of an aircraft in the final moments of landing			1
investigators likely are questioning the pilot about that decision , and , if there were problems with the approach , why he did not abort the landing			0
" that 's a key question : why did the captain feel the need to take over ? " said @entity73 , a former 737 pilot and civil aviation leader at @entity75 in @entity0			1
commercial aircraft can manage abrupt changes in wind direction , experts say			2
but the changing wind direction would have tilted the plane nose - up , and the pilot may have responded by pushing the nose down to maintain the proper glide path , pilots contacted by @entity1 speculated			1
' it was pretty chaotic ' as landing gear collapses , passenger says the @entity92 - 700 aircraft went from a 2 degrees nose - up attitude , when the plane was about 32 feet off the ground , to a 3 - degrees nose - down attitude upon landing seconds later , according to information previously released by the @entity16			1
the plane landed nose wheels first , instead of on the main landing gear as designed , and the nose gear collapsed , sending the plane on a lengthy skid down the runway			1
about 10 passengers were injured			0
the @entity16 said it has thus far found no anomalies or mechanical malfunctions with the plane			2
it is continuing its investigation			0
among the new details released tuesday by the safety board : -- the captain of @entity113 had flown for the airline for almost 13 years and had been a captain for six of those years			0
he had 12,000 total flight hours , including 2,600 hours as pilot - in - command of b - 737s			0
this was the pilot 's second flight into @entity6 , and he was " pilot monitoring " in both instances			1
( pilots tell @entity1 the captain 's inexperience flying into @entity6 was likely not a factor in the incident			1
commercial pilots frequently fly into unfamiliar airports and study the approaches before landing			2
in addition , the pilots of @entity113 were using an operational instrument landing system , which should have assisted in making the landing routine			0
) -- the first officer had been with @entity4 for 18 months and had 5,200 total flight hours , with 4,000 as pilot - in - command			2
he had about 1,100 hours in b - 737s , with none of those as pilot - in - command			0
the first officer had experience at @entity6 , including six flights this year			0
-- this was the first trip the flight crew had flown together and was the second leg of the trip			0
-- the weather in the @entity7 area caused the flight to enter a holding pattern for about 15 minutes			2
the crew reported that they saw the airport from about 5 to 10 miles out and that the airplane was on speed , course and glide slope down to about 200 to 400 feet			2
-- investigators have five videos showing various aspects of the crash landing .			0

@entity4 345 's captain took over during @entity6 landing , @entity16 says
such a change in that phase of a flight is unusual , aviation experts say
the pilots reported a wind shift during landing , @entity16 says
the flight landed hard , broke nose gear at @entity7 airport in july , injuring about 10
