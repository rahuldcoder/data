-- it 's a long way from the bits and bytes of @entity4 to the bright lights of @entity6			0
but former @entity8 exec @entity7 is ready for her turn on stage			1
@entity7 , the sister of @entity8 founder @entity10 , will do a two - week stint in " @entity12 , " the @entity14 - nominated musical that celebrates the glam - metal rock of the 1980s			1
her appearance is part of a " social networking " promotion by the show , now in its fifth year			1
( it also inspired a 2012 movie with @entity23			0
) " for over 2,000 performances ' @entity12 ' has taken audiences on a wild ride back to when ' social ' meant something very different , " producer @entity24 said on the show 's website			1
" every performance , for the last five years , has delivered an incredible onstage and audience experience , earning the show its title as @entity6 's @entity37			0
so for the next four weeks , kicking off with @entity7 , we 're going to be ' sharing ' the love with our audiences with a ton of fun surprises			0
" @entity7 , now ceo of @entity44 and author of @entity47 bestseller , " @entity43 : untangling our wired lives , " confirmed as much on her @entity8 page			1
" friends , it 's official ! i 'm joining the cast of @entity12 on @entity6 from march 14 - 28 ! ! ! # @entity55 # @entity54 , " she wrote			1

she sings in a band called @entity60 , made up of current and former @entity8 employees			1
the lighthearted group 's numbers range from @entity67 's " forget you " to a @entity65 parody , " @entity68			0
" " theater - going is one of the few sacred activities where audiences truly unplug and enjoy the moment with the live entertainment right in front of them , " @entity7 said in the statement			2
" it 's been a lifelong dream for me to perform on @entity6			0
i thought i needed to shelve those dreams for my career , but this experience has taught me that there are multiple paths to achieving our dreams			0
" in the age of social media where we share both our professional and our personal lives , having a successful career no longer means putting your hobbies and passions aside			0
as a @entity95 , a theater - lover , and a child of the 80s , i could n't be more thrilled for the opportunity to perform in ' @entity12 ' on @entity6			2
" @entity7 will play city planner @entity100 , whose numbers include @entity104 's " @entity103 " and @entity106 's " @entity105			1
