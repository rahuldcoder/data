-- there are two ways for pop stars to make a @entity4 : either power - sing through your problems like @entity7 , or make like @entity8 and dance till you forget what you 're supposed to be getting over			0
on her first release since checking out of rehab , @entity11 wants to have it both ways			1
she 's front - loaded " unbroken " with leave - no - synth - effect - behind @entity16 ( '' @entity17 , '' featuring @entity18 ) , shy love - in - this - club tracks ( '' who 's that boy '' ) , and @entity22 bangers ( '' @entity23 , '' with @entity24 )			1
so it 's a little unnerving when she gets to the album 's second half -- the part where , as she told @entity31 , '' i 'm singing about some issues that i 've never even spoken about before			1
'' having struggled with cutting since she was a preteen , @entity11 admits , '' i ended up with wounds to bind ... and i just ran out of @entity35 '' on the hugely affecting ballad '' fix a heart			2
'' @entity11 covers @entity38 's ' how to love ' in @entity39 : watch it here the piano confessional '' for the @entity42 '' finds her picturing herself at age 4 , begging her dad to '' put the bottle down '' and keep his '' selfish hands '' to himself			1
and then there 's '' skyscraper , '' an anthem so honest you can hear her voice breaking			0
@entity53 teams with @entity54 in @entity55 for ' @entity56 ' clearly it 's been a tough year for @entity11			2
but as @entity8 could tell her , sometimes bad years make great songs			0
