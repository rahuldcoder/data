@entity1 's first lunar rover is expected to land on the moon on saturday , less than two weeks after it blasted off from @entity4 , according to @entity1 media reports			1
the landing will make @entity1 one of only three nations -- after the @entity9 and the @entity10 -- to " soft - land " on the moon 's surface , and the first to do so in more than three decades			1
@entity15 , the unmanned spacecraft carrying the rover , is due to touch down on a lava plain named @entity17 , or @entity17 , shortly after 3 p.m. gmt ( 10 a.m. et ) on december 14 , according to the state - run @entity19 news agency			1
on landing , @entity15 will release @entity22 ( called @entity22 in @entity1 ) -- a six - wheeled lunar rover equipped with at least four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples to a depth of 30 meters			1
the solar - powered rover will patrol the moon 's surface , studying the structure of the lunar crust as well as soil and rocks , for at least three months			1
the robot 's name was decided by a public online poll and comes from a @entity1 myth about the pet white rabbit of a goddess , @entity40 , who is said to live on the moon			0
chopsticks and soup spoons : inspiration behind @entity1 's space tools weighing 140 kilograms , the slow - moving rover carries an optical telescope for astronomical observations and a powerful ultraviolet camera that will monitor how solar activity affects the various layers -- troposphere , stratosphere and ionosphere -- that make up the @entity4 's atmosphere , @entity1 's information technology ministry said in a statement			1
the @entity22 is also equipped with radioisotope heater units , allowing it to function during the cold lunar nights when temperatures plunge as low as -180 ° @entity62 )			0
@entity1 has rapidly built up its space program since it first sent an astronaut into space in 2003			0
in 2012 , the country conducted 18 space launches , according to the @entity68			0
the @entity15 mission constitutes the second phase of @entity1 's moon exploration program , which includes orbiting , landing and returning to @entity4			2
in 2010 , @entity1 captured images of the landing site for the 2013 probe , the @entity17 , which is considered to be one of the most picturesque parts of the moon			0
within the next decade , @entity1 expects to open a permanent space station in the @entity4 's orbit			0
timeline : @entity1 's race into space but scientists in the @entity9 have expressed concern that the @entity15 mission could skew the results of a @entity88 study of the moon 's dust environment			2
the spacecraft 's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon 's surface that could interfere with research already being carried out by @entity88 's @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , @entity98 , chair of @entity88 's @entity99 told news site , @entity101 in november			0
the @entity15 spacecraft blasted off from a @entity104 rocket in @entity1 's @entity105 on december 2 , and reached the moon 's orbit at 100 kilometers ( about 60 miles ) from its surface less than five days later			1
on tuesday , it descended into an elliptical orbit with its lowest point just 15 kilometers off the lunar surface , a spokesperson for @entity1 's @entity114 told @entity19			2
the @entity10 's @entity116 probe was the last space mission to land on the moon in august , 1976 -- four years after the @entity9 launched the manned @entity120 mission .			0

a @entity1 spacecraft , @entity15 , is due to land on the moon this weekend
@entity15 will release a moon rover to *collect* soil samples and study the lunar surface
the solar - powered robot contains a telescope and ultraviolet camera
@entity1 is one of three countries to make a soft - landing on the moon
