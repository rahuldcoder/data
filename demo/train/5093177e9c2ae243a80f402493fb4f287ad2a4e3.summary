@entity0 , @entity1 -- a violent reaction by @entity1 authorities to ongoing protests against high food prices has put a spotlight on president @entity9 's 25 - year rule over the @entity11 country and raised the fear of a return to the brutal days of @entity14			1
@entity9 's various police units and military are deployed around the country to keep a watchful eye on an increasingly impatient nation			1
with pistols and ak - 47s , men wearing uniforms in various shades of blue can be seen on every street corner and sidewalk in the capital , @entity0			2
it 's extremely confusing for a visitor to determine their purposes			2
locals explain that the " @entity36 " are special forces , sometimes called the presidential guard , while riot police wear a dark blue uniform			2
sporting red berets are the military police , the ones people say are notorious for using live ammunition on civilians			0
several other units wear various camouflage uniforms			0
the ones in khaki are the " proper police , " people say			0
at least 10 people have been killed in @entity1 in recent weeks as these various government security forces quash what many have described as one of the biggest challenges yet to @entity9 's rule			1
in a recent television interview , the 66 - year - old leader scoffed at suggestions his administration is behaving like that of former dictator @entity14 , whose 1971 - 1979 regime was known for massive human rights violations			2
" do you know what @entity14 used to do ? " he asked the interviewer			0
" murder them and throw them in ( the ) @entity65 for the crocodiles			0
i have not heard of ( @entity69 ) @entity68 's body floating for the crocodiles to eat			1
" @entity68 is the president 's former physician turned bitter political rival who since april 11 has been leading a " walk to work " campaign against the rising cost of living			1
he was brutally arrested late last week in @entity0			0
policemen , some in plain clothes , armed with pistols and @entity81 , broke @entity68 's car window and sprayed him with copious amounts of pepper spray before pushing him into the back of a police truck			1
it was the fourth time in three weeks he has been arrested			0
he was later let out on bail , and was in need of medical attention			0
that evening , independent news channel @entity92 broadcast the whole episode to the nation			0
the next morning local papers , including the government - controlled media , led with the story			0
the reaction was swift , fierce and chaotic			0
while driving downtown on friday morning , a group of journalists suddenly heard in the distance the sound of shooting -- rubber bullets , it turned out -- and saw hoards of people run for cover			0
" the people are unhappy about what happened to @entity68 , " a local journalist remarked			1
as the bells of @entity114 in @entity115 tolled in anticipation of @entity118 's arrival to marry prince @entity119 in what was labeled the fairytale wedding of the century , @entity0 and its surroundings were boiling			2
fearless protesters barricaded roads , confronting police in a clear display of anger at what many see as unnecessary brutality against a man who is simply highlighting the plight of all @entity1			1
by the time the prince had kissed his new bride for the second time , four @entity1 were dead , some 200 were injured and more than 300 were behind bars			1
such scenes have been playing out in @entity1 for weeks and the situation appears to be escalating			1
@entity9 blames the food crisis on drought and high oil prices , while @entity68 believes the mismanagement of the country 's economy over the past quarter of a century is at the core of the problem			1
since @entity9 's @entity145 seized power in 1986 , @entity1 has seen relative peace and economic growth			1
the country is the third - strongest economy in @entity11 after @entity151 and @entity152			1
but @entity9 , once seen as a new brand of @entity11 leader by the @entity155 , has over the years tightened his grip on power			1
he changed the constitution that limited presidential terms to two so he could run for a third term , and then a fourth one this year			0
his military and police are on standby waiting to crush any sign of dissent or rebellion			0
some have predicted an @entity168 - style revolution in @entity1			2
it was , after all , economic circumstances that lit the splinter that became the uncontainable bonfire some call the @entity174 revolution			0
whether @entity1 could be next remains to be seen			2
so far , the violent response to the protests has not appeared to deter a people who say they are fed up with poverty for the majority and prosperity for a few .			2

protests against food prices in @entity1 are being met with violence
president @entity9 blames the food crisis on drought and high oil prices
protest leader @entity68 blames mismanagement of the country 's economy
