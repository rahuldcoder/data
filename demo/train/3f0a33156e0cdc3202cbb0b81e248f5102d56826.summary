@entity0 -- the case of three women allegedly held captive for more than 30 years in @entity0 is one of brainwashing and emotional abuse , @entity0 's @entity2 said friday			1
police announced thursday they had arrested a couple on suspicion of being involved in forced labor and domestic servitude after authorities took a @entity14 woman , 69 , @entity16 woman , 57 , and 30 - year - old @entity17 to safety from a property in @entity20 , south @entity0			1
however , police told @entity1 on friday that while the man and woman were arrested under the slavery , servitude and forced or compulsory labor section of the @entity28 and @entity29 of 2009 , that law did not necessarily describe the alleged crime			1
" it is not as brutally obvious as women being physically restrained inside an address and not allowed to leave			2
what ( detective inspector @entity35 ) and his team are trying to understand is what were the invisible handcuffs that were used to exert such a degree of control over these women , " commander @entity34 said			2
" trying to label this investigation as domestic servitude or forced labor is far too simple			0
what we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years			2
brainwashing would be the most simplest term , yet that belittles the years of emotional abuse these victims have had to endure			2
" @entity34 said the investigation has uncovered " something that is , so far , unique to us and does not compare to any previous investigations we have carried out			0
" @entity35 said there were " clear allegations of slavery , " but officers were still establishing the details of the " complex and complicated " case and could not jump to conclusions			0
@entity64 , violence allegations " clearly the allegations are that people were being controlled , subject of coercion , violence			0
and as you 're aware , the case goes back three decades -- so there 's a lot for us to untangle , " @entity35 said			0
he said the women were subjected to physical abuse like beatings , as well as psychological pressure : " we are trying to figure out the nature of those invisible handcuffs			2
" police have not released the names of the man and woman -- both 67 -- alleged to have held the women captive but say they are not @entity88 nationals			1
they revealed friday that the two suspects were arrested in the 1970s but would not say why or whether they have a criminal record			1
the couple have since been released on bail , but have not returned to the @entity20 property at the center of the allegations , police said			1
" they have also been arrested on suspicion of immigration offenses , and we are working closely with the @entity101 , " @entity35 said @entity88 lawmaker @entity102 said friday that the house is in her constituency			1
she represents the south @entity0 neighborhoods of @entity106 and @entity107			1
@entity1 's @entity108 said police had told her that the group of people involved had presented themselves as a normal family , but officers would not detail how they were related			2
" i 'm both looking at the relationships -- as in biological -- and i 'm also looking at relationships -- how they interacted , " @entity35 said			0
he said police did not believe the victims had been trafficked into the @entity88			2
earlier , police said the 30 - year - old alleged victim " appears to have been in servitude for her entire life			1
" they said she and the two other women were " highly traumatized " and being cared for in a place of safety			2
police said @entity130 alerted them to the suspects in october after receiving a phone call from one of the victims			2
" the woman found the courage to contact the charity after seeing a documentary on television we are informed was aired by the @entity143 , " they said in a statement			2
' controlled freedom ' with the " help of sensitive negotiations " by the charity , police met with the @entity16 and @entity88 women on october 25			1
the women identified the place where they said they had been held , allowing police to rescue the 69 - year - old @entity14 woman and take all three to safety , @entity2 said			1
" we believe that the women had some controlled freedom , but at this stage we are still trying to find out to what extent and what form this took			0
the relationship between the women is part of an ongoing investigation , and we are not willing to speculate , " police said			1
@entity35 said it was an unprecedented case for the @entity2 's @entity167			0
" we 've seen some cases where people have been held for up to 10 years , but we 've never seen anything of this magnitude before , " he said			1
" our unit deals with many cases every year but has never unearthed such a staggering example of people held against their will for their whole lifetime			0
" he said authorities are in the early stages of a " complicated and sensitive " investigation			0
" these women are highly traumatized , having been held in servitude for at least 30 years with no real exposure to the outside world , and trying to find out exactly what has happened over three decades will understandably take some time			1
" sensitivity and secrecy police said they had seen no evidence " to suggest anything of a sexual nature , " but the investigation is ongoing			0
@entity130 spokeswoman @entity193 said the organization took " immediate action " to plan a rescue after learning of the women 's situation			1
" facilitating their escape was achieved using utmost sensitivity and secrecy and with the safety of the women as our primary concern , " she said , describing the work of those involved as " outstanding			0
" a television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of @entity130 prompted the call for help			0
" they 'd seen me on various news channels talking about forced marriage and dishonor violence , and they said i had a face they trusted , so they called our 24 - hour helpline , " @entity214 told @entity1			0
she said the process was " very difficult " and charity ceo @entity227 was personally involved in the negotiations " throughout the process until they were rescued -- so it was over a week of speaking to them -- she gained their trust and confidence , and they believed that when they came out , they would be taken to safety , they would be looked after , " @entity214 said			0
" these ladies have spent 30 years in captivity as slaves and have come out with absolutely nothing at all , " she said			1
" the road to freedom is n't going to be an easy one			0
" ' harrowing ' @entity227 told @entity1 she believed the youngest woman was born in captivity			0
the 30 - year - old is not related to the other two victims , but police are investigating whether she is related to the couple who were arrested , she said			1
@entity214 said she has seen the women on a number of occasions since their rescue			1
" they 're doing remarkably well considering how harrowing it 's been for them			0

" we all need to look out for neighbors and say ' is everybody absolutely safe			0
' and i think this is the tip of the iceberg			0
i think 30 years is going to be the exception for people being held , but i 'm sure this ca n't be the only case , " she said			1
