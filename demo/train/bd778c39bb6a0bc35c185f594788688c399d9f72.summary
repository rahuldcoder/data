@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 humorist @entity3 once said , " i 'm not a member of any organized political party			2
" the old saying goes that , come election time , republicans fall in line and @entity12 fall apart			1
the tradition in the @entity14 has been that , if you ran for president and came up short -- @entity18 in 1976 , @entity19 in 1980 , @entity20 in 2000 , @entity21 in 2008 -- next time , it would be your turn			1
among @entity12 , it was a free - for - all			1
@entity24 was thought to have a lock on the 2008 @entity12 presidential nomination , but @entity27 had other ideas			1
that 's how it has long been in our politics			0
republicans were the party of order , @entity12 were prone to chaos			1
in 2013 , the @entity12 seem pretty well organized			1
all of them eyeing the presidency -- @entity40 gov. @entity39 , @entity42 gov. @entity41 , et al			0
-- seem to be waiting to see what @entity24 will do in 2016 before announcing their intentions			0
last week , in @entity48 , @entity47 even had a cordial lunch with an old friend who she ran against once and may run against once more -- vice president @entity52			0
five things we 're learning from @entity57 - @entity56 spat meanwhile , republicans are engaged in a series of messy food fights			1
you have sen. @entity62 of @entity63 vs. sen. @entity64 of @entity65 over immigration ; @entity67 gov. @entity57 vs. sen. @entity56 of @entity68 over domestic surveillance and the cost of preventing terrorism ; @entity56 vs. sen. @entity20 of @entity72 over whether the @entity68 senator would -- if he ran for president -- be preferable to @entity24 ; @entity64 vs. the @entity14 establishment over defunding @entity76 ; and @entity62 vs. well , just about everybody over just about everything			1
the result is a battle royal with four or five slugfests going on at once			0
a few of them stick out as noteworthy			0
@entity64 poked at fellow @entity14 -- particularly those in the establishment -- for not being tougher on president @entity27 's top domestic accomplishment , asking : " if we 're not willing to fight on @entity76 , what issue are we willing to fight on ? " @entity62 continued that theme when -- in comments that got him in hot water with liberals and conservatives -- he accused fellow @entity14 of being part of a " surrender caucus " because of their reluctance to buck the tide			1
and at least one @entity14 scuffle -- the one between @entity57 and @entity56 -- is downright nasty			1
@entity57 started it when he criticized @entity56 's vocal opposition to warrantless federal surveillance programs , saying it hurt efforts to thwart terrorism			1
he sanctimoniously invited opponents to " come to @entity67 and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation			0
" @entity56 was n't in the mood for a lecture			1
he dismissed the attacks from @entity57 as " kind of cheap and sad " and suggested that if the governor " cared about protecting this country , maybe he would n't be in this ' give me , give me , give me all of the money ' ( mindset ) that you have in @entity48			1
" @entity57 was n't in the mood to be scolded			1
he suggested @entity56 " start cutting the pork barrel spending that he brings home to @entity68			2
" although , @entity57 said , he doubted that would happen because " most @entity48 politicians only care about bringing home the bacon so that they can get re-elected			2
" then @entity56 went for the knockout			2
" this is the king of bacon talking about bacon , " he said incredulously during an interview on @entity2 's " @entity131			0
" he clarified : " you know , we have two military bases in @entity68			0
what does he want to do , shut down military bases in @entity68 ? " i guarantee that given @entity57 's struggle to lose weight , most @entity4 wo n't think of military bases when they hear that a fellow @entity14 dubbed him " the king of bacon			1
" what 's a food fight without bacon flying through the air ? some of this conflict was inevitable			0
politics is a contact sport , and it always has been			0
this is how parties behave when they 're out of power and looking for a way to get back in			0
it 's also how politicians behave when -- after their party suffers a string of losses -- they try to whip up the special sauce that allows them to finally rack up a victory			2
@entity12 did the same thing after losing three presidential elections in a row -- 1980 , 1984 , 1988			1
along came a handsome , young governor from @entity166 with a staggering amount of ambition , and he decided that the way to break the curse was to market himself as a " new @entity7 , " which we came to understand meant more pragmatic and more moderate			0
still , what we 're seeing from @entity14 is n't just politics as usual			1
there is nothing wrong with a little conflict and soul - searching to recalibrate what a party stands for between elections			2
but this has gotten awfully rough			0
warring parties could find it hard to forgive and forget when they need to close ranks against the @entity12			2
this is n't like the political tussles of old			0
it 's not just that these folks disagree with someone 's ideas and tactics ; in some cases , it 's clear that they really do n't like that person			0
so when they butt heads , the goal is n't just to defeat their opponent but to destroy him			0
if this keeps up , do n't be surprised if voters decide in 2016 to keep these kindergarteners in their sandbox and far away from the @entity208			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : traditionally , @entity12 have been the party of internal feuds
now the @entity14 seem badly split , with top figures sniping at each other , he says
@entity57 and @entity56 traded barbs ; @entity62 , @entity64 also attacking
@entity211 : republicans are n't demonstrating that they have presidential *stature*
