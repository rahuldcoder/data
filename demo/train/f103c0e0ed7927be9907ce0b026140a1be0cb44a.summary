-- world champion @entity1 hailed @entity3 's new qualifying format after claiming pole position for sunday 's season - opening race in @entity6			1
the @entity7 headed off @entity9 's @entity8 in saturday 's new 15 - minute session , involving just the top 12 riders , while last season 's championship runnerup @entity14 was third to complete the front row			1
" it 's great to finish in pole position , especially knowing @entity21 was extremely fast over one lap , " @entity1 , who won last year 's race from pole , told the @entity3 website			1
he said of the new qualifying format : " it 's very different to last year and i think more fun for the fans to watch			2
" from the point of view of the riders , i feel more nervous and with more pressure on me because you know you have only four attempts for your last lap -- and not 15 like last year ! so it 's more important to go quickly and not make a mistake			0
" @entity38 's @entity37 was fourth for @entity39 ahead of @entity41 rider @entity40 and @entity43 rookie @entity42 , who had topped the practice times in his first outing for @entity46			0
@entity1 's new teammate @entity47 continued his struggles of the past two years at @entity39 as he could only qualify seventh			1
" qualifying was not fantastic for us , " said the seven - time world champion , who has won three times in @entity6 but not since his last season at @entity52 in 2010			1
" our performance in free practice was better than this , so we 'll wait for tomorrow			0
unfortunately in qualifying , on the second tire -- with which i could have improved -- i was stuck in traffic so could not improve my lap time and lost some positions			2
" for sure , tomorrow becomes more difficult to start from further back , but we have good pace so we can be quite competitive			0
" @entity14 is seeking to improve his record at @entity66 -- one of only two circuits on the current calendar where the @entity7 has yet to win in any category of bikes			2
" it 's important that we 're on the front row , " the @entity46 rider said			0
" i think the @entity75 are strong , so i just hope to improve the bike a little bit more and then be on the pace for the race			0
