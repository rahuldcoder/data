-- @entity1 and cpl. @entity2 do n't have much in common			1
one is best known as a comedian and the former host of " @entity5 , " while the other is recovering from serious injuries he sustained while serving in @entity8			2
but there is one thing these two share , and that 's a love of cars			2
so to say thank you to cpl. @entity2 for his service , @entity1 decided to gift the soldier with something that he knew he would enjoy : a brand new @entity19			1
@entity1 and @entity2 met through @entity1 's @entity22 comedy tour with the " today " show 's @entity23			1
" when i travel to entertain the troops , the best part ... is the few minutes i get to spend with each soldier , " @entity1 said on " today " wednesday			1
" behind every handshake , every hello , is a great kid			0
and i wanted to introduce the world to one of them			0
we sort of took all these wounded warriors and did a lottery and picked a soldier at random and drew something for him , and hopefully , it expresses what we want to do for all soldiers			0
" @entity2 was on foot patrol in @entity8 when a suicide bomber detonated himself on the street where @entity2 was standing			0
the soldier has had 10 surgeries to try to repair what was damaged , but he still suffers from constant pain , in addition to memory loss caused by a traumatic brain injury			0
@entity1 hoped to take his mind off some of that with the simple gift of a joyride in a 2015 @entity56 through the open roads of @entity58 , @entity59			1
" sometimes i think when you 're a soldier , you get this feeling that you 're all alone and the rest of the country does n't care , " @entity1 said			1
" so when people take a moment to stop and go , hey you , thank you very much -- i think it does something for them			0
" once they were done taking turns behind the wheel -- and after a pit stop for some barbecue -- @entity1 handed the keys to the @entity19 over to @entity75			2
" it 's yours , " @entity1 told him			1
have a lot of fun , do n't get any tickets			0
" to which @entity2 quickly responded with a smile , " i ca n't promise that			0
" @entity1 added on " today " wednesday that he " wanted to do something a little bit different " to show his gratitude to servicemen and women			1
" everybody helps the soldiers with medical issues and all those important things , but sometimes , that can be like getting socks for @entity97 , " he said			0
" you want to give them something that 's fun , something that has nothing to do with what happened to them			2
