@entity0 -- the @entity2 passed legislation thursday that would bar federal funding for @entity5 -- a longtime target of conservatives irritated by what they consider the outlet 's liberal bias			1
the bill passed 228 - 192 in a sharply partisan vote			0
most republicans backed the measure while every @entity15 opposed it			0
while the measure was expected to pass the @entity18 - controlled @entity2 , it is believed to have little chance of clearing the @entity21 - controlled @entity20			1
the move to strip funding comes after a conservative activist secretly taped a @entity5 fundraising executive criticizing @entity27 supporters and saying public radio would be better off without federal money			1
on tuesday , the @entity2 voted to cut $ 50 million from the @entity30 , which helps support @entity5			1
that measure was part of a larger bill to keep the government running for the next three weeks			0
the @entity2 moved last month to eliminate all federal funding for the @entity30 as part of its bill to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year			1
that bill , however , failed to pass the @entity20			2
among other things , the measure which passed the @entity2 thursday would bar any of @entity5 's affiliate radio stations across the country from using any federal funds to purchase programming from @entity5			1
forty percent of @entity5 's funding comes from member station fees , according to the outlet			1
roughly 2 % comes from federal grants			2
" we have to deal with the fiscal reality of this country , " said rep. @entity52 , @entity53			0
@entity57 has to figure out " how to do more with less			0
... we ca n't afford to be all things to all people			0
" public radio " has been wildly successful , " @entity52 argued			0
the outlet 's total number of listeners is rising , so " it should be moving toward a model where ( it ) can sustain " itself rather than relying on taxpayers			2
@entity5 's listeners are largely " wealthy " and " well educated , " claimed rep. @entity68 , @entity69			1
" it is time for us to remove the federal support system ... and see what @entity5 can do on ( its ) own			1
" " with the national debt over $ 13 trillion , the government simply ca n't afford to fund non-essential services , " said rep. @entity74 , @entity75			2
" @entity5 can survive on its own			1
" we need to " remove the taxpayer from the equation			0
" according to @entity5 's website , the outlet currently provides content to 900 independent stations , reaching 27.2 million listeners every week			1
democrats argued that @entity5 serves a vital public function			1
stripping it of public funds will do little to reduce the federal deficit while cutting popular programming in small towns and rural areas across the country , they claimed			2
" this bill would wipe ( programs like ) ' @entity98 ' off the road			0
it would wipe ' @entity102 ' right off the map , " said rep. @entity100 , @entity101			0
" @entity18 used to stand for @entity18			0
now it stands for @entity104			0
" @entity100 argued that many local public stations would not be able to attract a sufficient audience and fundraising base to survive keep without easy access to @entity5 's signature programs , such as " @entity110			1
" this bill " will snuff out stations from coast to coast , " he predicted			2
" this makes no sense			0
" the @entity18 has launched an " ideological crusade against balanced news , " claimed rep. @entity118 , @entity119			0
rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , circulated a letter to @entity2 members earlier in the week citing press reports that he said demonstrated that @entity125 -- the conservative activist who set up the taping -- " deceptively edited " the video to target @entity5			1
" biased ? no. unbiased , " said rep. @entity128 , @entity129			0
" @entity5 speaks the truth			1
... it provides a fair and balanced presentation			0
" @entity1 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report			2
