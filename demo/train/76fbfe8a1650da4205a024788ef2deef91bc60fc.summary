-- a powerful tornado ripped through @entity2 , @entity3 , last week , making the quaint community look like " a war zone , " according to the state 's governor			1
fortunately , the @entity8 was there to help			1
founded by 2008 @entity12 @entity11 , the organization brought its specialized fleet of disaster recovery equipment to @entity2			1
since 2007 , the @entity8 has crisscrossed the country , providing free aid to as many as 40 disaster sites			1
@entity11 recently spoke to @entity0 's @entity18 about the team 's efforts in @entity2			1
@entity18 : it seems like you got here right as the storm hit			1
were you one of the first guys on the ground ? @entity11 : we arrived just a few hours after the storm went through this mountain community			1
it was very interesting trying to figure out a way in , because we have huge tractor - trailers			1
a lot of these mountainous roads are very windy , and there were trees down , power lines down			0
but we eventually found the epicenter of the city right where the tornado went through			1
marciano : you 've seen a lot of disasters like this			2
what was your first reaction ? @entity47 : the tornado that went through @entity2 was pretty unique			2
not only did it go directly through the heart of town and destroy all of the infrastructure that 's needed for a community to get back on their feet , but it also went through the hills where a lot of folks were in their homes			2
( that ) makes it very difficult for firefighters and emergency workers to get through those windy hills and access those home sites to do search and rescue			0
marciano : what 's the reaction to your team when you get into town ? @entity47 : when we arrive on the scene sometimes , it is hard for these community leaders to really believe that we are here for free with all of this gear			1
but they quickly do realize that we are there to help and that we care			0
and when they see the equipment working and the light towers go up and the roads start being cleared , they begin to realize that we are good people and that we are coming with no strings attached to help them			2
... they need tools and resources that they do n't have themselves			0
and when they see us coming in with all the equipment ... they welcome us into the community because they know they need the help			2
marciano : what are some key things your team does to help communities like @entity2 ? @entity47 : after a tornado of this magnitude strikes a small community like this , the priorities have to be identified			2
the roads need to be cleared so that emergency workers like firefighters and search - and - rescue teams can come in and find the people and extract them to safety			2
they need lighting so they can see			0
it is very easy to walk into power lines or step on nails ... so light towers are important			0
so , we 've cleared the roads , we 've provided the light towers			0
this town has a small grocery store and gas station			0
... it needed power so that people could get food and water and baby food and the essentials , including gasoline so that the emergency workers can have fuel for their trucks and carry on			0
marciano : at what point do you decide : " ok , our work is done here			0
it is time to move on ? " @entity47 : the @entity8 provides a unique service			1
it 's that in - between phase , that gap when the storm first strikes and when traditional help arrives			0
our priority is that first day , that first night and that first few weeks until traditional help arrives			0
marciano : why do you do this ? why did you choose this road ? @entity47 : there is just something inside of me that feels compelled to help			0
when i am watching the news and i see those super cells go right over these small communities and heart of @entity165 , i know that people are going through some of the most traumatic times they have ever experienced in their lives , and i want to be there to help .			1
