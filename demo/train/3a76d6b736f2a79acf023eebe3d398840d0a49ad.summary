investigators are done examining the runway and the wreckage , which is now in storage at the airport			1

additional interviews with first responders is the only work still being done in @entity9 , the @entity2 said			1
the flight carrying 291 passengers and 16 crew took off from @entity32 and stopped in @entity33 before heading to @entity9			0
it was an unremarkable flight prior to final approach that should have been routine in ideal flying conditions			0
@entity37 regularly flies into @entity9			1
but flying too slow and too low as it neared the airport on july 6 , the pilots of the big jetliner sought to abort the landing at the last second			1
the plane slammed into the sea wall and then the runway , its tail breaking off and the fuselage full of people spinning down the tarmac			2
three passengers , all girls , died in the first notable @entity52 air crash in four years			0
more than 180 people were hurt and the rest walked away relatively unscathed			0
most were able to escape before the plane erupted in smoke and flames			0
the runway was littered with plane parts , bags , and a carpet of other debris that was examined in varying detail by investigators			2
investigators do not expect to know for several months at least what exactly caused the crash			2
but early information from the board has centered heavily on the actions of the crew			0
the pilot at the controls was training on the 777 although he was experienced at flying other big @entity75 and @entity76 jets and had landed in @entity9 previously in those planes .			0
