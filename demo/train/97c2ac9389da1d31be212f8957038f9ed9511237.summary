-- when @entity3 led a @entity5 takeover of @entity6 in 2010 , the @entity2 soccer club was battling crippling debts -- and a long - awaited return to @entity10 's top flight was tantalizingly out of reach			1
the new owners , frustrated by two more near promotion misses , decided that a major overhaul was necessary			0
along with major investment , the team 's historic blue strip was last season changed to red to appeal to @entity21 supporters and a dragon put on the club crest in prominent place above its iconic bluebird			0
one @entity6 fan was so disillusioned that he auctioned his club loyalty on @entity28			1
however , most supporters were won over when the " @entity38 " clinched promotion to the @entity31 as champions -- and their delight grew on sunday with a shock victory over one of the richest clubs in the world			0
@entity39 traveled to the @entity2 capital on the back of a 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity43 on the opening day of the season , but left smarting after a 3 - 2 defeat against a side widely tipped for an immediate return to division two			1
it was the first time @entity6 had hosted a top - flight match since 1962 , and @entity53 's team had suffered a 2 - 0 defeat last weekend at @entity55 -- a mid-table side last season			1
" this was the first time that we 've played at home in the @entity31 , and the first time in 51 years that we 've been in the top division , so it meant a lot to a lot of people , " he told reporters after two goals from former @entity66 striker @entity65 set up victory			1
" i 'm very proud of a lot of people at the club ; obviously the players but also the fans who made the atmosphere unbelievable today			0
also , the people who work at the club , because they 've been through some tough times -- to see them with smiles on their faces as i walked through the tunnel lightens my heart			0
" @entity39 are one of the top teams in @entity88 and @entity89 , and are full of top @entity31 talent			1
" as @entity39 's new manager @entity91 commented afterwards : " i did not expect to lose			2
" city , @entity31 champions two seasons ago , spent more than Â £ 100 million ( $ 155 million ) before the start of the season -- bankrolled by the club 's oil - rich @entity98 owners			2
however , it was @entity102 -- himself a big - money buy during the tenure of previous manager @entity105 -- who put the visitors ahead seven minutes after the break			1
but the @entity110 striker 's stunning strike was soon canceled out by @entity6 's @entity112 captain @entity111 , and one - cap @entity10 international @entity65 then twice got the better of his marker @entity114 to force home from successive corners			1
substitute @entity117 , one of @entity91 's acquisitions , gave the visiting @entity6 hope with a debut headed goal of his own in the 90th minute but @entity6 held on			2
" playing against a @entity39 team that only lost one game from a winning position last season , and to come back and show that character today -- i thought we deserved to win the game , " @entity53 said			2
" my players are here on merit -- we proved that today			0
" meanwhile , @entity134 became the third team to start with successive victories after beating the @entity31 's other @entity2 club , @entity137 , 1 - 0 on sunday			1
new signing @entity138 scored his fourth goal in three games as the @entity143 club joined @entity144 and @entity145 on six points			2
the @entity148 striker scored the only goal from the penalty spot in the second half , as he did against @entity152 last weekend before netting twice in the 5 - 0 @entity154 thrashing of @entity155			1
@entity156 , @entity134 's top scorer from last season , was given the weekend off due to his apparent injury			1
the @entity159 forward is expected to be unveiled by @entity160 in a world - record signing next week , but @entity134 manager @entity162 said he expected the player to be at training on tuesday			2
" there is interest from @entity160			0
whether the transfer will happen or not , hopefully you will have more news in the next couple of days but at the moment there is nothing i can tell you , " he added			0
" tomorrow is a day off			0
tuesday is training so i would expect him to be there			0
" villas - @entity178 wryly shrugged off @entity144 's sunday announcement that the club had hijacked @entity134 's bid to sign @entity182 forward @entity183 from @entity185 team @entity184 but confirmed that @entity187 defender @entity186 is set to join @entity134			1
" maybe someone will steal him as well , " @entity162 joked			0
@entity144 , meanwhile , will face a big test of the club 's title ambition under @entity162 ' former mentor @entity193 in monday 's clash with @entity31 champions @entity66 .			0

promoted @entity6 shock big - *spending* @entity39 with 3 - 2 victory
striker @entity65 scores twice for the *resurgent* @entity2 club
it was @entity6 's first home match in the top division in 51 years
@entity134 's 1 - 0 win over @entity137 gives @entity143 side second victory
