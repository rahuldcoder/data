-- @entity1 and i have fostered our share of dogs over the years			1
it 's always fun to watch her teach shy and withdrawn pooches to cuddle or play keep - away			1
but i must admit that @entity9 also has humped a few foster dogs in her day , even though she was spayed as a puppy			1
for advice on how to prevent this unwelcome behavior , i called trainers @entity17 of @entity18 to @entity19 in @entity20 and @entity21 of @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 both deal with unruly pets for a living , and both agree that it 's important to address " special hugging " early and often			1
" it 's more of an assertive thing than anything else , " says @entity31			1
" it 's a way of belittling another dog			1
it 's not necessarily dominating , but it 's very rude			1
" to correct naughty dogs caught in the act , separate them immediately , @entity31 says			1
give the offending pooch a 30 - second time out to sit and decompress			2
then allow the dogs to resume play			1
" if they step out of line again , offer time out again , " she says			0
" @entity47 , redirect , redirect			0
" @entity0 : ' @entity49 ' dog and his owner defy the critics changing this behavior can take time , @entity17 says			1
so do n't get frustrated			0
it 's the natural , normal way that dogs establish pecking order , he says , even if they have been spayed or neutered			1
that explains why @entity9 reserves this unwelcome greeting for fosters rather than play dates			0
she never dared such rudeness with @entity64 , my sister 's smaller but more dominant , pint - sized pooch			1
" it 's a primitive instinct , " @entity17 says , adding that a high - value treat such as cheese or meat can help lure pets to another activity			1
he stresses that the treat has to be especially good to trump that instinctual behavior to hump			0
also , it helps to put a leash on the dogs so you can lead them out of the room for a time out			1
no matter how embarrassed you get , it 's important to maintain a level head when addressing bad behavior			1
cursing or yelling only worsens the problem , warns @entity31			1
as a lead trainer of pit bull training classes offered by the @entity90 , she puts that theory to practice every saturday with mix of altered and unaltered dogs			2
if they grow agitated , @entity31 maintains a calm demeanor in the eye of the storm			0
" the minute you raise your voice and start yelling for something that 's embarrassing or stupid or bad , you lower your level of control , " she says			1
" when your dog does something that mortifies you , be swift and get in there			0
" @entity0 : how to train your dog to behave around guests that same rule applies if your dog decides to hump humans			0
pull them away and schedule an immediate time out that 's outside or far away from the situation			2
you also can step into the dog 's space , reasserting your authority			2
" humping a human , that 's pretty ballsy , " @entity31 says , no pun intended			2
that may be grounds for calling in a trainer for assistance			0
" if a dog shows confidence enough to belittle a human , they have low regard for people			0
that 's a dog that wo n't tolerate any correction from a lot of people -- and that can be pretty dangerous			2
" in a previous column , i offered tips to help dogs behave around guests			2
mastering the " place " command helps ensure good behavior			0
@entity140 also recommends teaching your dog to properly greet humans			0
start by making the dog sit and stay about 8 feet from the front door , but not right in front of the door			0
once your dog masters sitting and staying , it 's time for you to approach the door			2
if the dog moves , offer a correction and make it return to the original spot			0
return to the door and open it slightly , rewarding your dog for sitting and staying			0
by the end of the week , your dog should be able to sit and stay without approaching the door , even if it 's wide open			2
of course , it took much longer than a week for @entity9 and me			0
once you 've mastered this step , practice with familiar faces ringing the doorbell , then graduate to having strangers come to the door			0
with each exercise , the dog should maintain a sit and stay when guests arrive			0
" learning how to do this will also resolve the issue of humping humans , " @entity17 says			1
" dogs that hump humans do n't have boundaries and are saying , ' i 'm the boss			2
' " we ca n't have that , can we ? Â© @entity181			0
