the two - shot win over nearest challenger @entity12 also leaves him in fine fettle heading into the third major of the season at @entity16 and @entity17 later this month			1
@entity1 is four short of leader @entity2 on that all - time list but has not won a major since the @entity19 after his career stalled through injury and well chronicled problems in his personal life			1

" what an incredible week , " he said			0

" yesterday was a silent day , but i think everyone saved it up for today , " said @entity1 , who had the added pressure of being the tournament host in @entity63			0
@entity12 , who mounted a stiff challenge , is in no doubt that @entity1 is back to his formidable best			0
" i think he 's the only guy to win three tournaments on tour this year -- on three different golf courses , " @entity12 said			0
