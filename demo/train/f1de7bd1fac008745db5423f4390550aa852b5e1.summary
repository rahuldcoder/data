-- in what he described as a candid and comprehensive conversation , @entity4 , the special @entity6 envoy to @entity7 , laid out proposals saturday to president @entity9 that were aimed at halting the relentless carnage			1
it was the first time since @entity7 's long and bloody conflict that @entity9 met with such a high level diplomat			2
even as the two men spoke , however , @entity7 security forces continued to kill with impunity			2
at least 63 people were killed saturday , according to the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) , a network of @entity7 activists			1
another group put the toll at 98			1
@entity4 , a former @entity6 secretary - general , spoke to @entity9 about a ceasefire , the release of detainees and allowing unfettered access to agencies like the @entity30 to deliver much needed aid , a @entity6 statement said			1
@entity4 also proposed a start to an inclusive political dialogue that would " address the legitimate aspirations and concerns of the people			1
" he was staying overnight in @entity37 and will resume discussions sunday with @entity9			2
@entity4 also met saturday with opposition leaders and young activists , as well as prominent members of the business community			1
@entity7 state - run media said the meeting took place in a " positive atmosphere			0
" it said @entity48 told @entity4 that he was ready to find a solution but that such an effort would first require a look at reality on the ground and not relying on what " is promoted by some regional and international countries to distort the facts and give a picture contrary to what @entity7 is undergoing			1
" he also reiterated that " political dialogue or action can not take place or succeed if there are terrorist armed gangs on the ground that are working on spreading chaos and target the stability of the homeland , " the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) said			0
the @entity7 regime has maintained throughout the uprising that armed thugs are responsible for causing the bloodshed			0
that violence claimed more lives saturday in villages , towns and cities across the nation			2
among the dead saturday were 16 @entity80 fighters who died in an ambush in @entity82 , not far from the northern city of @entity84			1
activist @entity85 told @entity0 that @entity84 was suffering the kind of heavy shelling the world had seen in the besieged city of @entity90 and 46 of the casualties saturday were in @entity84			1
he estimated shelling every two minutes and that many residences and buildings had been damaged or destroyed			2
he also reported that security forces were searching house to house to arrest activists			0
" the number of tanks is much greater than defectors , " @entity85 said			0
" this scenario is very similar to what happened in @entity90			1
" violent clashes between government forces and defected soldiers erupted in the town of @entity108 , opposition activists said			0
and in the @entity114 village of @entity115 , " the regime 's army is indiscriminately bombing the city with anti-aircraft missiles			0

a demonstration in @entity134 " chanted for the disaster - stricken cities and demanded the regime 's ouster , " it said			0
the @entity135 , another opposition group , said 98 people died , including 39 military defectors			1
among 39 civilian casualties were 25 in @entity84 , the group said			1
it also said 20 government troops , including a brigadier general in a @entity37 suburb , were killed			2
@entity0 could not verify the casualty figures			0
amid the fighting , @entity4 's visit presented " a small sign of hope , yet so dim , " said @entity149 , a member of the @entity150			1
" there is no way that we can have any dialogue with the regime until the security campaign ends , " said @entity149 , who met with @entity4 saturday			1
" they keep playing the victim role , ( saying ) that they are defending the innocent civilians while they slaughter them and blame the bloodshed on others , " he said			0
@entity4 seemed extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in @entity7 and said he had received contradicting reports regarding the ongoing conflict , @entity149 said			1
@entity4 distanced himself from military intervention as did opposition members , agreeing that an armed conflict would only worsen the predicament of civilians , @entity149 said			1
both @entity4 and opposition members agreed that plans for a resolution can not be implemented as long as the bloodshed continues			1
" it is too early to apply a plan to resolve the crisis , " @entity149 said			0
" the situation on the ground ... is catastrophic			0
" @entity182 ambassador to the @entity6 @entity183 said @entity4 was trying to " broker a swift transition in which ultimately @entity9 steps aside and the people of @entity7 are able to choose an interim government that 's representative and leads to elections			1
" @entity189 said she wants the situation to be resolved peacefully , " to the extent that that remains still a viable outcome			0
" but time was running out for a diplomatic solution , said @entity195 of the opposition @entity196 of @entity197 in @entity7			0
" we are getting to the point of no return , " said @entity195 , a @entity198 - based dissident			2
" if we ca n't reach a political agreement today , we will head toward the abyss			1
... the regime is pushing the country as a whole toward a full scale armed struggle between the very well organized military institution and our people			2
" meanwhile in @entity213 , @entity212 foreign minister @entity211 agreed with his @entity215 counterparts on key issues regarding @entity7			0
they called for an end to the violence ; independent monitoring ; unfettered aid delivery ; and support for @entity4 's mission			1
but there was no getting around to the contentious nature of @entity211 's presence at the @entity215 meeting after @entity212 vetoed a key @entity229 resolution condemning the @entity7 regime			0
@entity231 also voted against the measure			0
@entity211 defended his nation 's ties to the region			0
" we have always supported the rights of the @entity215 world for independence and free development , " @entity211 said			0
" if you take the volume of economic ties with any of your countries then what we have , unfortunately , in trade and economy is in comparably low ( er ) than the volume of trade and economic ties with other outside partners			0
" @entity254 leaders called for intervention given the situation within @entity7 and held firm to their position that @entity9 must step down			0
@entity260 prime minister @entity259 said the @entity215 supported @entity4 's mission but it was also time to send in @entity254 and other international troops into @entity7			1
the @entity6 says more than 7,500 have died in the past year , and at least one activist group says more than 9,000 people have been killed			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm opposition or government reports of casualties or attacks from across @entity7 because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists			2
but a vast majority of reports from inside @entity7 show a systematic slaughter in an attempt to silence dissidents			2
@entity0 's @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and journalist @entity283 contributed to this report .			0

at least 63 people , perhaps as many as 98 , were killed saturday
@entity4 proposed a ceasefire , release of detainees and aid delivery
an activist reports heavy shelling of @entity84 , in the vein of @entity90
if the talks fail , ' we will head toward the abyss , ' says one dissident
