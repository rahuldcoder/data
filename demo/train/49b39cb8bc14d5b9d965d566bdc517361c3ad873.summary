@entity0 -- some @entity3 airport screeners should be given firearms and arrest powers to protect the larger workforce from shootings like last week 's tragedy in @entity9 , the head of the screeners union said monday			1
@entity13 @entity12 proposed creating a " new class of @entity3 officers " that would have law enforcement status			1
those officers -- and not airport police -- should be entrusted to protect checkpoints , @entity12 said			1
" we want to make sure we are doing everything possible to secure screening areas , " said @entity12 , national president of the @entity20 , which represents the nation 's 45,000 transportation security officers			2
friday 's shooting has reignited the debates over the proper role of airport screeners and how best to protect the workforce charged with protecting the @entity32 public			1
ideas run the gamut , from giving screeners guns to taking away their police - like badges			1
critics say the @entity3 erred in 2005 , when in an effort to professionalize the workforce and boost morale , it reclassified screeners as " officers			1
" the title wrongly implies that screeners carry guns and have arrest powers , critics say , and gives the public a skewed view of their jobs			1
in 2007 , the agency issued screeners uniforms with blue shirts , and the next year , it replaced the embroidered logos with metal badges			0
the result , critics say , is a work force of more than 45,000 people who hold the job of " officer " in name only			0
" despite their title and appearance @entity3 transportation security officers are not in fact federal officers , " rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , said monday			1
arming the officers " would only make matters worse , " said @entity71 , who has sponsored legislation to prevent the workers from wearing metal badges and using the title " officer			1
" in his two public appearances since the shooting , @entity3 administrator @entity79 , a career @entity80 agent before moving to the @entity3 in 2010 , has sidestepped questions about whether the officers should be armed			1
officer safety " is something we have dealt with really since the standup of @entity3 , knowing that in many respects @entity3 employees are the first line of defense when it comes to airport security particularly , " @entity79 said saturday			1
" and so given this tragedy , we will obviously look at and review our policies with airport police both here at @entity9 and of course around the country			1
" officer safety is " something that we have to assess , evaluate and then see what the best approach is , knowing that in the final analysis we ca n't guard against all threats and all risks , " @entity79 said			0
former homeland security secretary @entity108 called the idea of arming officers a " a big mistake			1
" " you have literally hundreds and hundreds of armed police officers roaming every major airport in @entity32			1
and i do n't think arming another 40 or 50 or 60 thousand people ... would have prevented this incident from happening , " he said			0
" when the individual removed the firearm , began firing , the response mechanism kicked in			0
so i personally think ( arming screeners ) is a bad idea			2
" both @entity79 and @entity108 spoke before @entity12 proposed creating a new tier of @entity3 offices			2
providing guns to all 45,000 - plus officers would be a weighty challenge			0
currently , the federal air marshals are the only @entity3 officers who carry weapons , and most were drawn from the ranks of law enforcement or the military			2
a change would be time - consuming , distracting officers from their mission : finding people and items that present threats to aircraft			0
and the change would introduce weapons into checkpoints , where they could be grabbed by deranged passengers and used against officers			0
mission creep meanwhile , airport police department unions have complained about @entity3 " mission creep			1
" mission creep " threatens the security of the airport , " representatives of the @entity152 wrote in a letter to @entity154 in september 2012			1
" @entity3 has expanded the scope of their authority beyond screening areas to more traditional ' police ' work without clear lines of delineation with airport police , jeopardizing public safety , contributing to a break in chain - of - command , and delaying timely law enforcement responses , " the group wrote			1
" @entity3 agents are attempting to investigate and / or correct ( security ) breaches , " the letter said , endangering the public , delaying police involvement and causing travel disruptions			1
@entity3 employees should be restricted to conducting passenger and bag screening , the letter said			2
the letter was signed by @entity179 , president of the @entity181 , and @entity182 , president of the @entity183			0
@entity179 said the @entity3 never responded to the letter			2
in the letter , the alliance said airport police have had a " long and productive " history working with federal law enforcement officers and the @entity3 's air marshals			1
" the only federal entity with which our officers experience constant tension is with @entity3 non-law enforcement operations , " it reads			2
what 's next although congress could decide to give @entity3 officers guns or remove their badges , there is a range of other options			2
rep. @entity201 , @entity202 , chairman of the @entity203 , specifically mentioned the increased use of @entity206 teams , which pair armed air marshals with other agencies to patrol airports and other transportation venues			0
" i think that with better coordination with local law enforcement should help tremendously , " @entity201 said on @entity1 's @entity211			0
but @entity201 placed little stock in other suggestions such as moving checkpoints closer to terminal doors			0
" it 's very difficult to stop these types of attacks , " @entity201 said			0
" anybody can show up , as we saw in the ( @entity224 shooting ) with the shotgun , in this case with the semi-automatic			0
" it 's almost like an open shopping mall			0
so , it 's very difficult to protect			0
but these vipr teams , i think , with local law enforcement ca n't provide that needed security			0
we are going to be reviewing this along with the director of @entity3			2
" @entity108 expressed a similar sentiment			0
" at the end of the day , i think there are certain kinds of risks for which there is no sensible , thoughtful , reasonable , economically appropriate way to abandon or to eradicate			0
and this happens to be one of them , at airports , " @entity108 said .			0
