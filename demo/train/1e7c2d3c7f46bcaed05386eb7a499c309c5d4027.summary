@entity0 was five months pregnant and taking photos of skeletal children in the @entity4 , when she felt her own baby kicking for the first time			1
" he came to life as a little person inside me as i entered @entity14 , the land ridden with death , " writes the @entity8 - winning photojournalist , of an assignment covering drought victims in 2011			1
in @entity0 's line of work , death -- and new life -- abound			1
since the mid- 1990s , she has covered the @entity20 in @entity21 , the war in @entity23 , the @entity25 refugee crisis , and countless more conflicts for media outlets including @entity28 , the @entity29 , and @entity30			1
her spectacular and deeply intimate images shine a light on places few would dare to travel , and are now gathered together for the first time in a vivid memoir called " it 's what i do : a photographer 's life of love and war			1
" the pictures of malnourished toddlers in @entity14 that day came as @entity0 was coming to terms with her own pregnancy			1
until he started kicking inside of her , the 41 - year - old had only ever thought of unborn son @entity48 as a " pea " or " avocado pit			0
" this was an entirely new jolt of reality for the tenacious @entity56 photographer -- " before @entity48 , you know i did n't really think about my mortality , " she told @entity1			1
" becoming a mother has n't necessarily changed how i shoot , but it certainly has made me more sensitive , and it certainly makes it much harder for me to photograph dying children , " she said , her voice warm and raspy over the phone from @entity61			0
that 's not to say @entity0 has stepped away from the action since having a child with husband and former @entity71 journalist @entity70 ; the family now based in @entity73			1
after all , this is the same woman who covered a prisoner exchange in the @entity77 , while seven months pregnant with her first child , and less than a year after being kidnapped in @entity79			1
she still goes into war zones , though these days tries to stay away from the front line			2
" i always knew my death would be a possible consequence of the work i do			0
but for me it was a price i was willing to pay because this is what i believed in , " she said			0
" now i think ' ok , i want to cover that story , but how can i do it in a way that i can get home to @entity48 ? " motherhood is n't the only thing that 's changed the stakes on the battlefield			2
last month @entity97 released a video showing the beheading of @entity101 film - maker @entity100 -- the latest in a string of gruesome journalist deaths throughout 2014			2
this is a dangerous new era for war correspondents in the @entity106 , says @entity0 , who went undercover documenting the lives of women under @entity20 rule well before 9/11 even happened			1
when the @entity110 fell , @entity0 was one of the few journalists to have an insider 's knowledge of working in @entity21 , and throughout the decade made a name for herself as one of the most accomplished reporters in the region			1
" when i first started out i really felt like : ' i 'm a journalist , i will be respected as a neutral observer , " she said			0
" and i do n't feel like that holds true anymore			0
i do n't think people respect journalists the same way they once did			0
" " in fact , we are a target because there 's a bounty on our heads			2
@entity97 can make a huge amount of money from journalists , though there are some countries who do not pay ransom like the @entity56 or the @entity136			0
" @entity0 knows that danger first hand			1
in 2011 , she and three other @entity29 journalists were kidnapped by @entity140 soldiers in @entity79 , and over several horrifying days were bound , punched and groped , before being released			2
she describes being blindfolded while one of her captors " caressed my face like a lover , " repeating the same @entity147 phrase over and over			0
" slowly he ran his hands over my hair and spoke to me in a slow , steady voice , " @entity0 writes in her memoir			1
" what is he saying , @entity156 ? " she asked one of her fellow captives			0
" @entity156 took his time in answering			0
' he 's telling you that you will die tonight			2
' " @entity0 not only lived through the ordeal -- within months she was back working in @entity160 , @entity161 , and @entity21			1
if her experience in @entity79 did n't put her off -- what would ? " i 'm at the point where i 've been kidnapped twice , two of my drivers have died , i 've lost so many friends , and every time something happens it does set me back a bit , " she said matter - of - factly			1
" but i do n't think it 's just one event that will basically turn me away forever , i just do n't think that 's the kind of person i am			2
" the youngest of four sisters born to @entity178 - @entity56 hairdresser parents in @entity179 , @entity0 's family home was " a kaleidoscope of transvestites and @entity183 lookalikes , a haven for people who were n't accepted elsewhere , " she writes			1
there was an open - door policy for the marginalized of society , and it put her in good stead for a life interviewing those living on edges			2
" now i go into all these situations and i really do n't feel like i judge people -- i just accept people for who they are and record their stories , " she said			2
even as we speak , the death toll from fighting in @entity200 rises , and while other people might thank their lucky stars they 're far from the crossfire , @entity0 feels " constantly tormented but what i 'm not covering			1
" " i feel bad that i 'm not there , " she said of the conflict			0
" i know my perspective on these things is the complete opposite to so many people			0
but i feel a responsibility , i feel like i need to do it because i have the tools to cover war , and because i 've done it for so many years			2
" it 's very hard to turn your back once you 're aware of what 's going on , and you 're aware of the injustices , and you 're aware of the civilian casualties , " she said			1
" it 's much easier if you have no idea and you 've never seen it			2
" indeed @entity0 's job is to keep her eyes open , where others must look away			1
she offers us a window into someone else 's hell , and yet possesses a special talent for finding moments of tenderness and hope among the rubble			0
being a female photojournalist has also given her unique access to intensely private worlds , often out - of - bounds for her overwhelmingly male colleagues			0
she can capture the horror and determination of women in rape centers in the @entity245 ; self - immolation patients in @entity21 ; and death during childbirth in @entity249			0
it takes a strong stomach -- and mind -- for this line of work , and @entity0 's book opens with a gruesome description of an airstrike in @entity258 , @entity79			1
" there was part of a brain on the passenger seat ; shards of skull were embedded in the rear parcel shelf			0
hospital employees in white medical uniforms carefully picked up the pieces and placed them in a bag , " she writes			0
how does she cope with the unimaginable horror year after year ? " i do take it away with me , and i 'm sure i do suffer from trauma			0
but i feel as though i 'm pretty well adjusted , " she said			0
" i do think that the more i cover war , the luckier i feel			0
i was born in the @entity56 ... in @entity179 of all places , and so i think it 's very important to not forget that			0
" perhaps covering war does n't require a hardened heart -- just an exceptionally large one .			1
