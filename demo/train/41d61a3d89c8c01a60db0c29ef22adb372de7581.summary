@entity0 -- @entity2 has slapped new restrictions on green tea and plums from areas around the @entity8 nuclear power plant because of lingering radioactive contamination from the ongoing disaster there			1
the latest government bans were prompted by the discovery of radioactive @entity15 and -134 at concentrations higher than @entity2 standards allow , chief cabinet secretary @entity12 told reporters thursday			1
both are nuclear waste products : @entity15 has a half - life of 30 years , while cesium - 134 has a two - year half - life			2
the government has now forbidden the shipment of both fresh and dried green tea -- normally touted for its health benefits -- from @entity27 , southwest of the plant ; from six towns in @entity30 and six towns in @entity32 , near @entity0 ; and two in @entity34 , where the crippled plant is located			1
in addition , @entity12 said , the government has banned the shipment of plums from three towns in @entity8			2
the moves come nearly three months into the crisis at @entity8 , the worst nuclear accident since the @entity43			0
one of three operating reactors at the plant melted down after the march 11 earthquake and tsunami , and the other two suffered extensive damage to their radioactive cores			0
though no deaths have been attributed to the accident , the resulting contamination has forced authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 people from towns surrounding the plant			0
in addition , restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated @entity2 farmers and fishermen since the disaster began , though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks			1
the plant 's owner , the @entity69 , has laid out a timetable for restoring normal cooling systems and fully shutting down the reactors by january			1
but prime minister @entity73 cautioned that people may not be allowed to return home immediately , " even if these prospects are realized			0
" " we might have to continue monitoring , and we need to maybe decontaminate , " said @entity73 , whose government survived a no - confidence vote thursday spurred by complaints about his handling of the twin crises			0
" and for that , there may be some more time needed			0
" the disaster has spurred @entity2 to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy and tighten safety standards for existing plants			2
a preliminary report from the @entity92 concluded this week that @entity2 underestimated the risks its nuclear installations faced from tsunamis , like the one that swamped the @entity8 plant and knocked out its cooling systems			2
but the @entity100 nuclear watchdog agency declared the country 's response to the disaster " exemplary , " praising @entity69 's operators for their " brave and sometimes novel " efforts to contain the crisis			1
@entity1 's @entity107 contributed to this report .			0

radioactive cesium levels prompt new action by @entity2

@entity69 hopes to wind down the crisis by january
