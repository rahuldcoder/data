-- before i started working on the documentary " @entity3 , " i assumed like many others that dolphins and orcas enjoyed living at @entity8 and other marine parks			1
they always seemed to be smiling , jumping merrily around their tanks , eager to put on a show for human spectators			1
however , when i met @entity16 , my perspective changed			0
@entity16 was the man responsible for capturing @entity17 -- the original " @entity16 " -- from the wild and helping to create the language used to train dolphins to do tricks and flips			1
when @entity23 died in his arms some years later , @entity16 realized the whole process of capturing and training dolphins was wrong			1
he eventually co-wrote the book " behind the @entity33 , " where he explains that the smiles you see on these animals are not true reflections of happiness			2
in actuality , they hate to be enclosed in their holding tanks and are often not fed until it is time to perform their daily routines			0
during his time as a trainer , @entity16 learned dolphins had true feelings -- they would get depressed , stressed out , even suicidal			2
in some parks , the trainers have to give the animals @entity48 and @entity49 to treat the ulcers that develop from their stress			1
the horrific tragedy that occurred last week at @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55 , has left me deeply shaken			0
my heart goes out to @entity58 and her family			0
@entity60 lost her life doing the job that she loved , yet i -- like @entity16 -- believe that this job should no longer exist			0
we know now that the whale involved in this accident has a well - documented history of violent behavior			0
@entity53 knew of this history yet continued to exploit the animal and endanger the lives of its employees to put money in its pockets			0
if this is n't a wake - up call , i do n't know what is			0
at this very moment , a dozen boats in the town of @entity82 , @entity83 , are heading out and rounding up hundreds of dolphins in a secluded cove			2
the fisherman will close off the cove with nets , and with the help of employees from various dolphinariums , they will try to find the next " flipper " among their catch			0
the fishermen will snatch these beautiful creatures from their natural habitats , hoist them into nets , load them onto airplanes and drop them into a cement tank in the middle of @entity103 , @entity104 or other nearby @entity106 countries			0
in some ways , these animals are the lucky ones			2
these dolphins escaped the fate of many of their pod mates , who are brutally slaughtered with primitive harpoons -- turning the cove into a scene straight from @entity119 's " @entity118			2
" the water turns bright red with the blood of the slain			0
the fishermen then transport the meat -- despite health concerns of mercury content in the dolphins ' systems -- back to shore , where they sell it to local vendors			2
it 's time for us to step up and make a difference in these animals ' lives			1
until we make marine parks obsolete , dolphins and other sea mammals will continue to be senselessly captured and slaughtered			1
we can no longer fall for the argument that @entity53 shows " make us love the dolphins and want to understand and protect them " -- this could n't be further from the truth			1
as i see it , we will only truly love and understand these animals when we can watch them running wild and genuinely smiling in their natural habitat			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			1

dolphins seem to be smiling , but captive ones experience stress , @entity154 says
@entity154 says captive dolphin trade leads to slaughter of the animals
until we make marine parks obsolete , dolphin trade will continue , @entity154 says
