-- having cycled around the world and then swum the length of @entity3 , adventurer @entity4 is taking on an altogether different challenge -- to restore a historic wartime ship which was set for the sailing scrapyard			1
as well as saving a piece of maritime heritage , @entity4 says there was a more practical necessity behind his unusual purchase			1
" basically my swim from @entity14 to @entity15 left me flat broke and i need somewhere to live , " he told @entity0			1
" i 'm 32 and have had to move back in with my mother			2
" people have the impression that adventurers and explorers are all rich but nothing could be further from the truth			0
" @entity4 has sold the support boat that was his constant companion during his 900 - mile ( 1400 km ) four - and - a - half - month swim up the west coast of @entity3 last year to fund his purchase of @entity27 , a six - berth motor yacht with historical connections			1
titanic connection it was made in 1931 by famous @entity33 shipbuilders @entity34 and @entity35 , who were also responsible for the ill - fated titanic			2
" i love the history behind this , " said @entity4			1
" it has a double teak hull and being 82 years old was more of an attraction for me than just having a boat to live in			2
" @entity4 is writing a book and capitalizing on his new - found celebrity ( " the last month or so have been crazy " ) to help fund the project , hoping to equip @entity47 so he can live completely self - sufficiently			1
" that means solar panels and a wood - burning stove and other environmentally - friendly features , " he said			2
there is a " growing demand " for wooden boats of this type , according to @entity53 , the owner of @entity54 which sold @entity4 his piece of history , said " it 's like owning a classic car , they stand out from the crowd , " he told @entity0			1
@entity64 has dealt in boats which have belonged to royalty and foreign heads of state , but it is doubtful he would have had such an unusual customer as the intrepid @entity70			0
" he actually brought @entity47 during the middle of his epic swim and had not actually set eyes on her , " he revealed			0
online purchase @entity4 takes up the story : " i saw it on @entity77 and thought , ' they must have got the price wrong , ' so i got my mother @entity80 to check it out			1
living nearby , @entity80 was able to arrange a quick viewing and the purchase was completed			0
" it needs a lot of work and it 's not habitable at the moment , " @entity4 admitted			1
@entity53 , who has a special affection for @entity27 and wanted her to go to a " good home , " said he had no doubt @entity4 could achieve anything he set his mind to			1
" he 's an extraordinary guy who breaks the mold , " he said			0
" to do his swim on a shoestring budget makes it a remarkable achievement and it took quite a while for the penny to drop with a lot of people			0
" @entity4 and his four - strong support team left @entity14 on the southwestern tip of @entity106 on june 30 -- only able to start their adventure because of late help from swimwear manufacturer @entity109			1
by his own admission " a pretty average swimmer , " the combination of difficult weather and his lack of experience put them behind schedule			0
herculean task @entity4 's coach @entity123 , himself a 36 - time @entity122 triathlete , had done his best to teach him better technique but knew he faced an herculean task even with such a determined athlete			1
" he was below average as a swimmer , great fitness but with heavy dense legs that dropped in the water , " he told @entity0			0
helped by continuous tips from @entity123 , @entity4 made painstaking progress along @entity106 's west coast , averaging about 15 km per day spent in the water			1
he was severely hampered by tides , and especially jellyfish			0
@entity4 was stung so often he grew a " ridiculous " ginger beard to protect his face with lashings of @entity140			1
@entity4 , who once climbed @entity141 dressed as a penguin , cut an almost comic figure with his emaciated body -- his weight plummeted to below 10 stone ( 63 kg ) -- topped by a giant and straggling mass of ginger hair and beard			2
but his determination to succeed was no laughing matter and , as he neared @entity15 at the northern tip of @entity153 , his feat began to capture the media 's attention			0
after completing the final agonizing stretch in freezing cold waters on november 11 ( " way behind schedule , " said @entity123 ) @entity4 could perhaps perhaps afford to rest on his laurels and bask in the glow of his success			2
new challenge but for a man who needs to test himself in everything he does , from building a home on an old ship to raising money for his charities with his incredible endurance tests , it has not taken long for him to get itchy feet			0
" my next challenge is running from @entity179 to @entity180 , " he announced in a matter - of - fact way about a 7,000 - kilometer journey across the continent of @entity177			1
not one to let the grass grow under those feet , @entity4 has already purchased a website domain to publicize his attempt			1
after his swimming and cycling feats , it would complete an " ultimate triathlon " and he is planning to attempt the final leg in 2015			0
he will again enlist the help of @entity123 , who has run 75 marathons plus completing a triple @entity122 where the final leg was a 126 - km foot race			2
@entity123 is warning that this will be the " toughest challenge " yet for @entity4			2
" from first meeting @entity195 knew he could cycle around the world and possibly swim the length of @entity3 , but this will be much harder despite him being slight in stature , " he added			1
" running long distances day in , day out is very destructive on the muscles and joints			0
" @entity204 run ? not only that , @entity205 - born @entity4 -- whose father is a rhino conservationist -- has been dabbling with the idea of running for an animal charity			1
but even he may baulk of running the whole thing in a rhino suit			0
" perhaps they can make me a lightweight version , " he joked			0
assuming sales of his book and other media work bears fruit , @entity4 may also have the time between his training to restore @entity27 to former glories			1
the 63ft @entity221 was a real work horse of the @entity224 fleet , being used for the recovery of torpedoes , sea survival exercises and ferrying duties for service personnel			0
she was professionally converted to a motor - yacht in the late 1940s and owned by the same family until recently			0
@entity4 has already registered her with @entity3 's @entity232 ahead of the further works			1
@entity234 hopes the peripatetic @entity4 will use @entity27 on @entity3 's extensive network of canals to best " show her off to the public			1
" simple philosophy for now @entity4 will keep his mother company and prepare for his next epic adventure , but he is keen to emphasize that he is not some " super human " individual and does not take himself too seriously			2
" i do n't have titanium bones and i was not good at sports at school , " he said			0
" my message is anyone can do this			0
" but @entity123 believes his @entity250 © does indeed belong to a special breed of individuals who can push themselves to the limit and beyond to achieve their goals			0
" humans have a natural instinct to explore and see what is possible , " he said			0
" some people dream but only a few go and find out what is possible			0
" @entity4 certainly falls into that category .			2

@entity4 has cycled around the world and swum length of @entity3
his latest swimming feat left him *drained* of *financial* *resources*
he has purchased a former wartime naval vessel to live on
the 32 - year - old is now training to run the length of @entity177
