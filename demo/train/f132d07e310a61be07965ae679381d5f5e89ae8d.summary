@entity0 , @entity1 -- the villagers ' faces light up as @entity5 arrives			1

" these families , they are so poor			0
they do n't have electricity , " said @entity5 , a native of rural @entity1			1
" it 's only kerosene and firewood that they use for lighting , cooking			1
" the amount of money that every household uses to buy kerosene every day -- if they can just save that money , they can be able to buy food			1

do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity44 the youngest of four children , @entity5 grew up in a home that stressed the importance of education -- his father was a high school teacher			1
but years of exposure to smoke while studying by kerosene and firelight left @entity5 with eyesight problems			2
with a lack of good light to study by -- @entity5 often had to share one lantern with his siblings and other family members -- he remembers the frustration of unfinished homework and poor exam performance			1
" i could n't compete effectively with other kids who had access to lighting , " he said			0
" in every home in the village it was the same			0
many children drop out of school for these reasons ... so they remain poor for the rest of their life			0
all along i was asking myself if there is anything that can be done to improve this situation			0
" in 2004 , while attending a @entity1 university for agriculture and technology , @entity5 found his answer			1
he was fiddling with a dorm experiment involving the timing of @entity84 ( light - emitting diode ) @entity87 lights when it struck him : the environmentally friendly light source could be used to light rural homes			1
" i knew it would have to be sourced by the sun to be useful to people in rural areas , " he said , " but [ @entity96 ] had never seen a solar panel small enough for individual homes			1
" then , while walking home from visiting a friend , @entity5 stumbled upon a broken - off piece of a discarded solar panel			1
with it , he was able to light a small number of leds			2
his project -- @entity107 , @entity108 -- was born			2
" i immediately knew the impact that [ it ] would have on the rural communities , " he said			2
an artisan helped him design the solar lantern , which @entity5 calls @entity113 -- swahili for " good light			1
" to help get the project started , @entity5 's family and friends subsidized his student loans for two years			2
production of the lanterns was slow until @entity5 attended a leadership training program sponsored by the nonprofit @entity123			1
when the group heard about his @entity113 , it immediately committed to help , eventually bringing @entity5 on as a partner and chairman of the board			0
the group has helped reduce production costs to $ 20 per lantern			2
costs are covered by donations			0
volunteers help build the lanterns and work with local government and women 's groups to determine the communities most in need			1
the group sets a small percentage of the cost of each lamp to go toward the volunteers			0
" we 're helping them to earn a living			0
they 're able now to sustain their families , " he said			0
@entity5 works on the lantern project full time without pay and eats only one meal a day to help save money and build more lanterns			1
he said he expects costs to decrease further as the program grows			0
the group buys excess pieces of solar paneling , cut from commercially sold panels , in bulk from an overseas company			2
in an outdoor metal shop , @entity5 and volunteers hammer scrap metal for the frame of the lantern			2
@entity5 estimates he 's distributed 10,000 lanterns -- and he has no plans for slowing down			1
" i want to reach out to as many rural communities as possible , " he said			2
" the impact is saving lives			0
" children can now study			0
households can buy food with the money they save on kerosene , reducing hunger in communities			1
the solar lanterns help reduce carbon emissions , too			1
@entity5 said that when the time and need arises , he intends to service , replace and recycle his lanterns			0
for villager @entity188 and her three children , life will change dramatically thanks to @entity5 and his solar lantern			2
" i am so grateful for the lights , " she said			0
" my children will have light to read , and i 'll have my own light to cook in the kitchen			0
no more sickness brought [ on ] by smoke			0
" for @entity5 , the satisfaction comes in knowing that he 's helping to lift people out of poverty			0
" i just feel like it 's right , " he said			0
