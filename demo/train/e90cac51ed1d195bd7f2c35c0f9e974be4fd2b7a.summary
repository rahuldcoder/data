-- not everyone gets it			2
but for some of us , travel is best expressed through celebration			2
we prefer to exchange culture over the clinking of glasses and between the flashes of strobe lights			2
conversations punctuated by " @entity13 ! " and " @entity14 ! " show us more than any guidebook			2
i view myself as a kind of international nightlife connoisseur			2
as an entrepreneur , author and all - around life enthusiast , i 've been around the world many times over			2
and of everyone i know , i feel the most qualified to throw an absurd list like this together			2
each city is judged on four criteria , each given a score from one - to - 10 1			2
how late each night and how many nights per week is the party good ? 2			1
is it a good crowd -- cosmopolitan , friendly and , yes , good looking ? 3			2
judged on quality and variety offered in each city			2
how likely you are to have an experience that you 'll still be telling your friends about a decade from now			2
i 'm embarrassed to admit how much time i spent on this list ( seriously , there was an @entity48 spreadsheet involved ) , but i finally narrowed it to 10 cities and i 'm confident with the end result			2
first , my honorary mentions : @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
my apologies party people , but the competition was stiff			1
@entity62 hours : 7 people : 5 music : 5 experience : 10 total : 27 a lot of travelers continue to pass through @entity62 not realizing there 's more to it than the seedy dregs of @entity71 , or the backpacker haven of @entity73			1
@entity62 has developed a vibrant and classy side as the city has become more cosmopolitan			1
whether it 's a series of gorgeous rooftop hotel bars downtown , rock bars near @entity84 , dance clubs just off @entity79 or trendy pubs in @entity81 and @entity82 , there 's legitimate , quality adventure to be had			1
best place to mingle with the locals : the young kids prefer @entity90 , while many of the city 's beautiful people are drawn to the clubs on @entity95 11 or upscale @entity96 , among others			1
@entity98 hours : 9 people : 7 music : 6 experience : 7 total : 29 " the @entity108 " puts a @entity103 spin on the insane @entity105 practice of eating dinner at midnight and then dancing until dawn			2
while living there , i remember trying to go home as the sun came up and an @entity114 friend telling me she wanted to go to an after - party instead			1
it was eight in the morning			0
although not as affordable as it used to be , @entity98 is still a relative bargain among major world cities			0
the locals love good rock music , too			0
best itinerary : start with the calmer bars of @entity124 and work your way up to the taverns of @entity128			0
there 's no rush , believe me			1
@entity132 hours : 8 people : 8 music : 6 experience : 9 total : 31 a staple			0
no nightlife list would be complete without it			0
@entity138 has something for everybody , from @entity142 power forwards blowing their signing bonuses to middle - agers gambling their way through a midlife crisis			0
i tend to stick to the southern end of the strip -- @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 -- but it 's hard to have a bad night out in @entity132			1
best place to waste your life savings and love every second of it : @entity151 in the @entity159			0
get to this nightclub early or suffer through the two - hour line			1
@entity162 hours : 8 people : 8 music : 8 experience : 8 total : 32 @entity162 is the undiscovered party gem of @entity167			1
beautiful , friendly people , all night dancing to a wide variety of music			0
and , of course , the summer festivals			0
obvious tip , but still good to keep in mind : do n't go in winter			1
best place to learn why the @entity177 do it better : @entity179 35			0
good drinks , good food			0
@entity182 hours : 9 people : 8 music : 8 experience : 7 total : 32 the first rule of @entity182 is that you do n't stay on @entity188			1
the second rule of @entity182 is that you do n't stay on @entity188			1
guidebooks and pub crawls funnel the least savvy visitors there			0
other parts of the city are far more interesting at night			0
clubs do n't get going until well past 1 a.m. each day			1
most of the top clubs are scattered throughout the northern part of the city			0

and there will always be the pubs			0
best place to suffer local pretension : @entity217			0
tell them you know a promoter named @entity221 even though you do n't			1
@entity223 , @entity224 hours : 9 people : 9 music : 7 experience : 8 total : 33 @entity223 is the dark horse on this list			0
often overshadowed by its more beautiful and glamorous sister , @entity231 , @entity223 is actually the cultural hub of @entity224			0
the city 's glory is n't apparent upon arrival			1
the place is n't beautiful			1
but dig into the sprawling concrete mass and you 'll find greater diversity and intensity on a nightly basis than almost any other place in the world			0
best place to dance with a hot @entity224 until he / she has to go straight to work : d - edge on a thursday after 1 a.m. 3			0
@entity248 hours : 7 people : 10 music : 9 experience : 8 total : 34 although it 's not true that the " city never sleeps " ( it 's usually done by 3 or 4 a.m. ) , @entity248 scores big simply because it offers something for everybody on any night of the week			1
warehouse parties in @entity275 , mega-clubs in @entity273 , trendy hipster joints in the @entity258 , hotel lounges , college bars , indie rock shows , loft parties , hip hop and jazz , heavy metal and opera -- there 's almost no limit to the ways this city entertains you			1
best place to buy a single drink for more than you spend on some nights out : @entity280			0
@entity282 hours : 10 people : 6 music : 10 experience : 9 total : 35 if a city 's mental health was determined by how many hours of the week its clubs were n't active , @entity282 would be a lunatic in a straightjacket , repeatedly slamming its head against a padded wall			1
witness : walking out of a venue at 9 a.m. on a sunday to find that there 's still a line to get in ; a club with beds installed on its bottom floor so patrons can sleep without the inconvenience of having to leave ; ceilings made completely of led lights ; a swimming pool next to the dance floor ; bouncers with face tattoos			1
best place ( s ) to experience the big - club vibe : @entity311			0
if you ca n't get in ( it 's random ) , then @entity314			1
@entity315 , @entity105 hours : 10 people : 9 music : 9 experience : 9 total : 37 every party hound must make a pilgrimage to @entity315 at least once			1
the venues are n't as much clubs as they are life experiences			1
nowhere else have i seen a wind tunnel built into a dance floor or parade floats and foam dropped from the ceiling like it 's the @entity330 indoors			1
in @entity315 , you do beach parties during the day , hotel bars in the evening and dance to the best djs in the world all night			1
best place to have an out - of - body techno experience : the clubs in @entity340 ( rather than @entity341 ) are worth the extra expense			0
