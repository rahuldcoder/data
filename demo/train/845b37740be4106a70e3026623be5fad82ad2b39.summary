-- any footballer who holds a passport for a particular country should be allowed to represent them on the football field			1
that is @entity9 president @entity8 's take on the hot topic that is dominating the build - up to the final round of @entity14 qualifiers for the @entity15			1
debate has raged in @entity17 after the country 's national team manager @entity18 revealed he had been looking at the latest starlet off the @entity22 production line -- @entity23			1
the @entity24 - born 18 - year - old has starred for the defending @entity27 champions this season and could qualify to play for @entity17 through residency rules if he stays in the country until he is 23			1
blog : ' your country needs you ! but which country ? ' @entity37 's @entity36 then raced headlong into the debate by telling a press conference while on @entity17 duty : " the only people who should play for @entity17 are @entity17 people			1
" those remarks only served to transcend the dispute across the sporting spectrum as @entity17 cricketer @entity45 , @entity46 by birth but with an @entity17 mother , challenged @entity36 's view			2
the owner of 99 test caps for @entity17 pointed to @entity53 winner @entity52 and double @entity55 champion @entity54 as examples of sportsmen who competed under the @entity59 banner but who were born in another country			1
" it 's very difficult -- we live in a global world , in a truly globalized environment , " @entity8 told @entity62			2
" in a global world when you 're entitled to have a passport of a country and you have legislation for that , you should be entitled to play for the national team of that country			1
" my wife is @entity17 and i 've got two kids -- they were born in @entity77 -- how i should go back home and explain to my wife that they could n't wear the @entity17 national team ( jersey ) ? " when you think about nationality , are they @entity17 ? their mother is @entity17 but they were born in @entity77			1
i have other friends who have different nationalities ( of parents ) and were born in a third country			2
@entity15 : is @entity24 football 's coming force ? " maybe they were born in a different country just because of a momentary placement for a job but would they represent that nationality or would they feel something different ? " @entity8 has stabilized @entity77 giants @entity9 since he assumed the presidency in may 2010 , with the club still dealing from the fall out of the @entity105 match - fixing scandal that saw them relegated to the second tier in @entity77			1
in the three years he 's been in charge @entity8 has overseen @entity9 's return as @entity77 's most successful club , winning two @entity112 titles in a row , and their move to a new stadium , which has helped strengthen the club financially			1
@entity9 are this season gunning for a third straight @entity112 crown , matching their achievement of 80 years ago , but he still thinks @entity77 's top league has a long way to go to match the powerhouse trio of domestic competitions in @entity17 , @entity122 and @entity123			1
" @entity112 is not where it was in the 1980s and 1990s when it was the fabulous destination for every football player , " he explained			0
" i think we have to catch up a lot of ground we have lost in the recent past			0
" at the moment we are fourth and we should be more considered about the countries behind , like @entity133 & @entity134 , from a @entity136 ranking point of view rather than catching up with who is in front of us			0
" @entity77 needs to go through a structural reform of the way we run football before we can actually aspire again to clinch third place , then move up the ladder to become number one			0
" @entity27 dream for @entity147 after ' miracle journey ' this week the finest players in @entity136 are preparing to represent their countries as the final round of @entity15 qualifiers determine who makes it to @entity155 in 2014			0
but looming large in the background are the issues that surround the tournament that is still nine years away -- the proposed 2022 @entity15 in @entity159			0
football 's world governing body @entity163 last week set up a task force to investigate the possibility of moving the 2022 competition from @entity159 's summer to winter , to avoid the searing heat that could affect both players and fans alike			2
no final verdict will be offered before the latest installment in @entity155 has been completed but any shift in date would have huge ramifications for @entity136 's leagues and clubs			0
but @entity8 is confident a solution that suits everyone can be settled upon			1
" i think the fact there is a lot of chat is good because everyone within the football family wants to make sure the right decision is made , " he added			0
" i think there has been a clear position from the @entity163 executive committee which is a decision will be taken following the @entity15 @entity190 2014 -- that should leave plenty of time to make the right decision			2
" moving a @entity15 from june or july when it is normally played to a different month is a huge involvement			0
we tend to speak a lot about the players who actually take part in the competition but that is the minority , you have to think about what the rest of the football family will do			0
" we have to understand what the calendar will look like , how we will make the players rest , is it going to be a one year change of calendar			0
" what is important is that the clubs ' point of view will be listened to and i think @entity213 will make sure that point of view will be well represented within the right bodies			0
" @entity8 also acknowledged the wider issues involved with shunting the date of one of the most watched sporting events on the planet , including the agreements that would have to be struck with television broadcasters			2
" you have to understand the tv broadcasters will have their own say -- every player involved will have a point of view , " he said			0
" you clearly sold to the @entity229 broadcasters a product that should be taking place in june or july and you are going to put it throughout the regular season of @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 -- will that have the same value ? " there are a lot of players which need to come to an agreement , i 'm quite sure with the good will of everybody a good solution will be found in the interests of football itself			2

@entity9 president says players who have a passport should be allowed to play for that country
debate raging after @entity17 manager @entity18 said @entity23 is on his radar
@entity22 winger was born in @entity24 but could qualify for @entity17 under @entity163 rules
@entity8 confident solution can be found if @entity163 decide to move @entity260
