-- when news first broke about a month ago about enterovirus @entity3 , also known as @entity3 , with hundreds of children hospitalized across the @entity6 with respiratory illnesses , i definitely took notice			1
i clicked on a few news stories , like i 'm sure many other parents did , especially since my girls , ages 6 and 8 , were back at school and school , while wonderful , can also be a petri dish for young people			1
but then i must admit i kind of put the issue out of my mind , worrying instead about homework , the fall routine and whether my girls are getting enough sleep			0
( their mom certainly is n't ! ) that was until i heard about a @entity27 4 - year - old who died in his sleep september 24			1
it is the first death health officials are directly linking to the virus			1
tests have also shown @entity3 in four other people who have died , but the @entity34 has said the role the virus played in those deaths " is unclear at this time			1
" as of monday , the @entity34 has confirmed 594 cases of enterovirus @entity3 in 43 states and the @entity39			1
when i put out a query to parents across the country on social media , asking if they are growing more anxious about the virus , many , like @entity44 , said they definitely are			1
" i am way more interested and worried about enterovirus than @entity51 , " said @entity44 , a mom of an 8 - year - old daughter in @entity46 and host of the blog @entity49			2
" while my daughter is ( blessedly ) healthy as could be with completely healthy lungs , and goes to a smaller school with fewer virus exposures , i still worry ( particularly since , i , sadly , do have unhealthy lungs and while this is not an adult virus , i am still hyperaware )			2
" avital @entity59 , whose son is 7 , said her child 's elementary school recently sent an email to parents letting them know a few students were home with a respiratory illness and one was hospitalized			0
the school did not make it clear if any of the children had enterovirus , she said			1
but despite that alert , she said she 's not in the " freak out " camp about the illness			0
" in the large picture , there are really only a small number of cases of the virus across the country , but i think the media focus causes people to panic ( and ) worry about it , " said @entity59 , editor of the motherhood anthology " @entity82 " and host of the blog @entity81			1
" it 's definitely a scary illness but i 'm not all that worried about my son contracting it			0
" doctors urge parents to keep things in perspective			2
first , " few people who contract @entity3 develop symptoms other than a runny nose and a cough , " said dr. @entity100 , associate professor of pediatrics and global health at @entity104 's @entity103 and @entity105 of @entity106			1
secondly , the impact of @entity3 is " quite modest " as compared to the flu , said dr. @entity113 , chief of pediatric infectious diseases and epidemiologist for @entity116 , which is part of @entity118 in @entity119			1
" @entity120 kills several hundred children in an average year , " said @entity113			2
" this is dramatically more than the impact of @entity3 , but we are familiar with flu , while @entity3 is something that seems new and noteworthy			1
" so , who is most at risk ? it appears that children with asthma are more likely to develop significant symptoms than children without a history of breathing issues , doctors said			1
the most important sign that parents should be on the lookout for is trouble breathing			0
" children who may need medical attention may breathe fast , use their neck or chest muscles to breath , and feel as if they can not catch their breath after coughing , " said @entity100 , who is also the @entity139 at @entity104			2
children who may not be able to drink well may also require medical attention , she added , as well as any child who is not acting like his or herself			2
many parents are heading to the doctor 's office earlier than usual because of fears of enterovirus			2
said a parent on @entity157 , " my child was sick last night			0
at dr today just to rule it out			0
normally i would just keep close eye 4 a day			0
" another concern for parents is figuring out when to keep children home from school to keep them safe			2
@entity113 said he would not let fears a child will get the virus guide that decision			2
many children will never catch it and most wo n't become seriously ill if they do , he said			0
plus , he said the dangers may be decreasing			0
" by this time in many cities , the virus is on the wane , so the risk is going down			0
in fact , many children have probably already been infected and are now immune but because the symptoms were not remarkable , no one knew			1
" the only reason to keep a child home , said @entity100 , is if the child is sick or if school officials advise children to stay home because other children in the school are hospitalized			0
the best prevention is exactly what you likely tell your children every day			0
they should wash their hands frequently and carefully , especially after using the bathroom , before eating and after they come into contact with people who have cold symptoms , @entity113 said			1
there has been some speculation that hand sanitizers do n't work with this virus , and that may be partially true , he added			0
" enteroviruses are somewhat more resistant to alcohol - based ( sanitizers ) than another viruses , " he said , so soap and water is the best first choice and hand sanitizers are a good backup if you ca n't wash your hands			0
" doing something to wash your hands is better than doing nothing , " he said			0
@entity59 said while she is not worried about her son getting the virus , she 's taking advantage of all the attention			0
" it 's a good opportunity to do what we can to boost our children 's immune systems , get flu shots and remind about best practices when it comes to hand washing , etc. " are you growing more concerned about enterovirus @entity3 ? tell @entity235 on @entity157 or @entity236 on @entity237 .			1

@entity27 *preschooler* first death officially linked to enterovirus @entity3
nearly *600* cases of the virus in 43 states and @entity39

doctors also caution that flu remains a bigger danger for children
