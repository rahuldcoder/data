@entity0 -- @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 all share responsibility for the deadly explosion that resulted in the april 2010 @entity8 oil spill , according to the final federal report on the matter released wednesday			1
the three companies " violated a number of federal offshore safety regulations , " according to the report , which includes a series of recommendations for improving drilling safety			1
the report , issued by the @entity19 , concludes that a key cause of the explosion was a faulty cement drilling barrier at the @entity24 well site			0
" the precise reasons for the failure of the production casing cement job are not known , " the report states			0
but the disaster was " the result of poor risk management , last minute changes to plans , failure to observe and respond to critical indicators , inadequate well control response , and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling " at the site			0
@entity2 was " ultimately responsible " for operations at the site " in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel , equipment , natural resources , and the environment , " the report concludes			1
but @entity3 , the owner of the @entity54 rig , was also " responsible for conducting safe operations and for protecting personnel onboard			2
" meanwhile , @entity4 -- a @entity2 contractor -- was " responsible for conducting the cement job , and ... had certain responsibilities for monitoring the well , " the report says			1
a spokesman for @entity2 said the company agrees with report 's conclusion			1
" the @entity54 accident was the result of multiple causes , involving multiple parties , including @entity3 and @entity4 , " @entity63 said			1
" @entity2 ( has ) acknowledged its role in the accident and has taken concrete steps to further enhance safety			2
... we continue to encourage other parties to acknowledge their roles in the accident and make changes to help prevent similar accidents in the future			0
" @entity77 , a @entity3 spokesman , said the report " confirms that the primary cause of the incident was the catastrophic failure of the cement in the @entity24 well , " but his company continues to take " strong exception to ( any ) criticisms of the @entity87 drill crew			2
" @entity4 continued to deny any responsibility for the tragedy			2
the report " incorrectly attributes the operation decisions to @entity4 , " said @entity90 , a @entity4 spokeswoman			0
" every contributing cause where @entity4 is named , the operational responsibility lies solely with @entity2			1
@entity4 remains confident that all the work we performed with respect to the @entity24 well was completed in accordance with @entity2 's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions			1
" the explosion on the rig led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the @entity8			1
eleven people working on the rig died in the explosion , while 16 others were injured			0
besides the oil , hundreds of thousands of gallons of chemical dispersant went into the water			0
at the peak of the crisis , in june 2010 , 37 % of @entity8 waters -- a total of 88,522 square miles -- were closed to fishing due to contamination			0
the @entity119 government announced plans in august to hold its first oil and natural gas lease sale in the @entity8 since the incident			2
the proposed sale , scheduled for mid-december in @entity125 , will include more than 20 million acres in the western @entity8 , according a recent statement from the @entity127			0
@entity1 's @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report			0
