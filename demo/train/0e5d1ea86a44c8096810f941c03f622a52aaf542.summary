join @entity0 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity2 at 10:30 a.m. et wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			0
@entity0 says journalists do n't serve the public if they push rumors			1
( @entity2 ) -- two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the @entity15			1
one week before comedian @entity18 passed away , text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died			0
i was in @entity22 , and friends and colleagues from @entity25 , @entity26 , to @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 , @entity30 , were saying they knew for sure that the 50 - year - old comedian was dead			0
the rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead , which was subsequently published by the @entity37			0
what makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth , and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition			2
then there is the " rumor " of an affair by former @entity56 senator and two - time presidential candidate @entity57			1
the story was broken by the @entity58 after months of digging			2
ultimately , a source came forward and was ­ likely paid for the information ­ that blew the lid off of the story ; the tabloid 's editor said " you can assume " the @entity58 paid for it			1
the story exposed @entity57 as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened			1
there has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet was n't able to verify the story and run with it			1
the heated discussions even reached the point where @entity76 editor @entity75 told @entity79 ' " newshour with @entity78 " that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself , " when rumor arises , we 're going to need to address it			2
and , unfortunately , we may need to address it before we can determine whether it 's true or not because it 's having impact , as it was in this case			2
" sorry , @entity75 , i disagree			0
the most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we do n't traffic in rumor and innuendo			0
none of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control			2
running with such rumors has far - reaching implications			2
just check out this month 's @entity105 , where @entity106 has a great story on the collapse of @entity109			1
the investment bank 's demise , some conclude , was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems , even though it was sitting on $ 18 billion			1
the rumors kept going and going ­ and when the story hit the airwaves , it spread like wildfire			1
in one week , @entity109 was no more , and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the @entity123 behemoth			0
we should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story			2
the rules are simple : either you have the facts or you do n't			1
if you do , you run with the story			1
if you do n't , you leave it alone			0
the @entity58 got the story because its reporters were able to confront @entity57 as he was leaving the @entity134 hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair			1
then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 @entity142 vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the @entity58 said was the child of the mistress			0
with other major media outlets turning up the heat , @entity57 admitted the affair in an interview with @entity151 's @entity150			1
no media executive should be pulling his or her hair out , trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor			0
if they had , and the facts did n't support the rumor , then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more			0
we have an obligation to stick with the facts , and nothing else			1
and no matter what a blogger , web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with , the day we choose to alter our standards , our credibility and integrity will be shot			1
in the end , as former @entity174 anchor @entity173 said in 1988 , that 's all we 've got			0
nothing is worth losing that , even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over			0
