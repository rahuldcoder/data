a very old spy plane and a very new computer system played pivotal roles in last week 's computer glitch that temporarily paralyzed flight operations in southern @entity6 , officials tell @entity7			1
the problem involved a @entity10 aircraft , the type famed for conducting reconnaissance missions over the @entity13 during the @entity14			0
a @entity16 computer system interpreted the @entity10 's flight path at a very high altitude as if it were flying in a much lower and more crowded airspace			1
the computer -- which anticipates the flight path and looks for possible conflicts such as other aircraft or restricted airspace -- was overtaxed by the many flight changes the @entity10 had plotted , officials said			2
that work used much of the computer 's memory and interrupted its other flight - processing functions , @entity16 spokeswoman @entity27 said in a statement			1
the agency said it has added computer memory to prevent a recurrence , while others said officials are racing to install a more permanent computer patch			1
the hourlong computer shutdown wednesday afternoon led to dozens of delayed , diverted and canceled flights but did not result in any mishaps			2
it had the most impact in the @entity44 area , where flights were grounded while experts sought to troubleshoot the problem			0
the side effects lasted almost half a day			0
to resolve the issue , the @entity16 " has enabled facilities that use the computer system to significantly increase the amount of flight - processing memory available			1
the @entity16 is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence of this specific problem and other potential similar issues going forward , " @entity27 said			2
two @entity16 officials , speaking on background monday , blamed the shutdown on the unlikely convergence of two events			0
first , a @entity10 aircraft flew a path that involved numerous waypoints and altitude changes in airspace controlled by three facilities			0
those facilities were the @entity44 and @entity70 , and the @entity71 at @entity72			0
simultaneously , there was an outage of the @entity75 , a primary conduit of information among @entity16 facilities			0
" that ( @entity10 2 ) flight plan , coupled with the @entity75 outage , in essence created a perfect storm , " one official said			0
the @entity84 has 32 u- 2 aircraft , which are capable of flying at altitudes up to 90,000 feet , according to @entity87 's			2
@entity89 stealth and spy planes the fact the plane was a u- 2 was not significant , one @entity16 official said			1
but the plane 's many waypoints , or geographic fixes , and its numerous altitude changes overwhelmed a system that projects the flights path and anticipates problems			1
the situation was complicated by the @entity75 outage , one official said			0
that overtaxed the @entity16 's flight - processing system , which in turn brought down the @entity16 's new @entity107 system , which manages high - altitude air traffic			1
the @entity16 official likened it to a problem with a software program causing a laptop computer to crash .			2

an @entity16 computer system *misinterpreted* a spy plane 's altitude and path
the u- 2 's many flight changes overtaxed system , eventually led to a ground stop
flights , especially to @entity6 , were delayed and diverted
the @entity16 has added memory to prevent a recurrence of the problem , agency says
