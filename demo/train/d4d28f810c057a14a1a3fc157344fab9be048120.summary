@entity0 -- a major food safety bill that passed the @entity3 and @entity4 earlier this year before stalling because of a procedural problem won final approval tuesday and now goes to president @entity7 to be signed into law			1
the bill , designed to increase government inspections of the food supply in the wake of recent deadly foodborne disease outbreaks , originally passed with wide support in both chambers after originating in the @entity4			0
however , it needed approval again because it violated a constitutional requirement that bills that raise revenue be initiated in the @entity3			1
the @entity4 passed its version of the @entity22 on sunday , and the @entity3 voted 215 - 144 for final approval on tuesday in one of the final sessions of the lame - duck @entity26			1
the bill , which represents the most sweeping overhaul of the food safety system since 1938 , allows for greater governmental regulation of the @entity32 food system -- currently in the national spotlight for numerous egg and produce recalls			1
among its provisions , the bill gives the federal @entity38 the authority to issue direct recalls of foods that are suspected to be tainted , rather than relying on individual producers to issue recalls voluntarily			0
currently , the @entity38 can negotiate with companies , but has no power to enact a mandatory recall			0
it also requires food producers to develop written food safety plans , accessible by the government in case of emergency			1
under the measure , the secretary of @entity53 would be required to create a food tracing system that would quickly focus on the source of contamination should an outbreak occur			0
it also requires food importers to verify the safety of all imported foods to make sure they are in accordance with @entity32 food safety guidelines			2
in the @entity4 version , an amendment sponsored by @entity68 sen. @entity67 of @entity69 exempted relatively small - scale producers that sell most of their food directly to consumers within their state or within a 275 - mile radius of where it was produced			0
@entity67 had called his amendment a " win for anyone who eats food , " noting the local food processors still would be responsible for demonstrating that they had identified potential hazards and were implementing preventive controls to address the hazards , or demonstrating to the @entity38 that they were in compliance with state or local food safety laws			2
@entity1 's @entity91 and @entity92 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity3 votes 215 - 144 for final approval
a constitutional error in the bill 's origination force a second round of approval
the bill *includes* the biggest overhaul of the food safety system since 1938
