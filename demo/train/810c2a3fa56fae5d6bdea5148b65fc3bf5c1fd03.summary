-- @entity5 artist @entity4 , he of the guerilla techniques and ever - increasing popularity , is about to be unceremoniously identified to the highest bidder in an @entity8 auction , which ends wednesday			1
at press time , the winning bidder is offering one slim dollar shy of a million			1
bidding started at $ 3,000 ; the auction has had 38 bids			0
in the listing , the seller states , " i have uncovered [ @entity4 's ] identity by matching up the prices of his sold pieces to corresponding tax records			1
i will reveal no more details ... i give you 100 % assurance that it is most certainly the full name of the street artist known as ' @entity4			0
' " the seller also says that @entity8 had previously terminated his auction because he was selling an intangible good ; the seller is now technically offering for auction a piece of paper containing @entity4 's legal name			1
the party offering @entity4 's identity is hardly a power seller , having a fairly sparse but mostly positive record that dates back to 2001			2
at this time , we have no way of determining whether the winning bidder is being taken to the cleaners to the tune of $ 1 million or whether the seller is legitimately peddling an exclusive glimpse into the identity of a public figure who clearly wants to be anything but public			1
however , we read on the artist 's website that not all @entity4 work that is sold necessarily corresponds to the artist himself			0
@entity52 : @entity4 still hiding in plain sight " @entity4 neither produces or profits from the sale of greeting cards , mugs or photo canvases of his work , " the site reads			0
" he is not represented by any of the commercial galleries that sell his paintings secondhand			0
" @entity4 gained a bit of stateside exposure in october 2010 when he directed an opening sequence for " @entity66			0
" what do you think of this auction ? would you want to know @entity4 's identity , or do you think he deserves to live privately and relatively anonymously ? let us know your thoughts in the comments			2
