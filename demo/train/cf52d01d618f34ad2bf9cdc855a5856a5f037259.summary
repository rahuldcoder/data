-- the words " @entity2 died " appeared on my @entity4 screen			1
like many of us living in the digital age , i learned that the pop diva passed away by way of text message			0
sent by my 25 - year - old daughter , the announcement shocked me but soon triggered fond memories of the days when she and her younger sister would belt out @entity2 's latest hit along with the radio			1
their voices were unleashed in that gleeful , full - throated and uninhibited way that only pre-teen girls seemed to do			0
( imagine " and i - eee - i - eee - i will always love you " at earsplitting , hilarious volume )			0
a few of the high notes were clearly out of my girls ' easy reach in their spontaneous renditions			0
but they reveled in emulating @entity2 nonetheless			1
i 've heard plenty about @entity2 's troubles during the course of the week			1
despite her battles with drugs and alcohol , many people have good memories of her and her songs			0
so what made " @entity49 " so glorious in the transcendent musicianship that @entity2 displayed in her recordings and concerts ? @entity2 possessed the perfect vibrato			1
this effect was facilitated by her deceivingly effortless diaphragmic support			0
@entity2 belted out chorus after chorus on hit after hit , demonstrating white - knuckled control over this parameter of her " singer 's toolbox " with an aplomb that seemed unfair to lesser vocalists			1
and the sheer stamina it took to achieve this elusive aspect of a singer 's art separates the wannabes from the real @entity71			2
never noticed that , right ? that 's because she was so good at it			2
@entity2 was famous for having a very wide range			1
some of her songs spanned quite a bit of vocal territory , from alto to the highest soprano			1
what was remarkable is that she hardly ever " bailed out " by flipping into a falsetto voice -- you know , that head - buzzing sound that men emit when they 're doing bad imitations of female opera singers			2
@entity2 seemingly had no natural break between the high and low registers of her instrument			1
this unique quality was highlighted because when she did flip into the " head voice , " it was employed as a subtle garnish , a precious design element in a phrase			0
her impeccable intonation -- just one of the reasons her " @entity104 " has become iconic -- instilled a " trust " in her listeners			1
when every note is perfectly in tune , as they were in a classic @entity2 performance , we relaxed and gave in to the sheer beauty of music			1
beyond the gift of her instrument , @entity2 's musicianship comprised an uncanny way of handling the material she was given with such expertise and attention to detail that the songs became hers and hers alone			1
her sense of musical balance allowed her " crowd " the cadences of a song 's key passages with " just enough " sonic information before landing coyly in the next structural part of the song			0
although her work grew more melismatic as her career progressed , she never overused this technique like some of her myriad imitators			0
she mostly executed them in clever twists at the ends of phrases or tossed them off with stunning ease between plainly rendered melodic statements			0
this allowed many of us to sing along with her at full voice , by ourselves , in the car			0
( surely , we 've all done this )			0
and she made us feel it			0
through musical economy and powerful execution , @entity2 could shape the emotional contour of a song whether in long concert - versions or on a four - minute record			2
her exquisite beauty together with that " come hither / do n't take another step closer or i 'll call my cousin " camera presence intrigued us			0
certainly , this infectious package of beauty and talent was at least one of the reasons my youngest daughter , now a budding operatic coloratura soprano , is pursuing a life of long , beautiful gowns and very , very high notes			1
miss @entity2 's ubiquity in the media made that seem like a reasonable dream for many of the young women she mesmerized			1
@entity2 became a pop star the old fashioned way -- not through a virile @entity183 video or as a contestant on " @entity185			2
" she was discovered , given a record deal , provided material and the rest was lots of hard and endless work			0
now that she 's gone , we can do nothing but remember : remember how she and " the voice " seemed like two separate entities			2
remember how she performed that voice ; how she allowed us to witness it , how she obviously enjoyed it herself			0
in the end , the voice just could n't keep up with the extravagances and toils of her life in the spotlight			1
