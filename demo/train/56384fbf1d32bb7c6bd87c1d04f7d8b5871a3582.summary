-- if you can define @entity3 's legacy in one line , citing just one of his dramatic actions , then you have missed most of the man			1
the former @entity9 prime minister led a life that looks much like the history of his country , filled with trauma , heartbreak , creativity , bloodshed and transformation			1
he aroused intense hatred from his enemies and profound admiration from his followers			0
he had strong opinions , took bold , risky actions			1
he made brilliant moves and disastrous mistakes			1
@entity26 stood at the center of the greatest disputes , the most feverish controversies in the country 's history			1
and then he stunned the world with a radical change of heart			0
the brazen right - wing hardliner remains a target of hatred for many in the @entity39 world			0
and yet , when he suffered a devastating stroke in 2006 , he had undergone a breathtaking political conversion			0
once a major proponent of the plan to build @entity45 settlements in territories captured during the @entity47 , he had decided it was time for @entity9 to withdraw from much of the territory			1
as he told the @entity51 ' @entity50 in 2004 , he did n't believe the @entity53 leaders would respect a peace agreement , but he did n't want @entity9 to rule over millions of @entity53			1
so , he said , " i discussed this between me and myself and came up with a new initiative			0
" initially , nobody liked his idea very much			0
" in @entity9 , the right does not like me to do it , and the left can not do it , " he said , " but you do n't wait forever			1
" despite bitter protests from his former allies and stiff resistance from the settlers , he carried out the " @entity73 " in 2005 , removing every single settler and every @entity9 soldier from the @entity72			1
and he cryptically spoke of more " painful compromises " to come			0
" we yearn for peace with our neighbors , " he said to @entity9 , " even at the price of painful concessions			1
" there is every reason to believe he was preparing to withdraw @entity9 settlements from much of the @entity82 , as well			1
had @entity26 stayed in office , the @entity9 - @entity53 conflict would look very different today			1
@entity26 embodied the @entity9 dilemma of how to obtain peace while maintaining security			1
as he had predicted years earlier , the withdrawal from @entity72 ultimately turned the territory into a launching pad for attacks against @entity9 towns			1
and yet , few @entity9 wish their country still occupied the @entity72			1
the larger - than - life prime minister helped his country survive in a deeply hostile region , where @entity9 's neighbors made it clear from the day the state was founded that they would find it the happiest of outcomes if the jewish state would cease to exist			1
but he also drove @entity9 into terrible quagmires			1
barely 20 years old in 1948 , he sustained multiple injuries fighting in a war against half a dozen @entity39 countries , which attacked the moment @entity9 declared its independence			2
in 1973 , when @entity113 and @entity114 armies crossed into @entity9 on @entity115 , while much of the country was fasting for the calendar 's holiest day , @entity9 appeared at risk of falling			1
@entity113 forces were headed for @entity120			0
it was @entity26 who devised and executed a plan to cross the @entity123 , cut off and encircle part of the @entity113 army , a plan that helped @entity9 win the war and pave the road to peace			1
he suffered head injuries in battle but kept on fighting			0
pictures of @entity26 with his head bandaged while winning the war became iconic , a metaphor for a country battered , creative , resilient			2
he was the defense minister who carried out the withdrawal of all @entity9 , including settlers , from the @entity140 in exchange for peace with @entity113			2
the darkest , most destructive chapter in @entity26 's life unfolded in @entity145 in 1982 when he was defense minister			1
it is by that chapter that most @entity39 remember him			0
back then , @entity9 civilians were coming under constant attack from the @entity150 , the @entity150 , which had become a state - within - a state inside @entity145			1
@entity26 launched an invasion to remove the @entity150 , allying @entity9 forces with @entity145 's @entity156 militias , the @entity157			1
@entity9 forces allowed @entity157 fighters to enter the @entity53 refugee camps of @entity160 and @entity161 in @entity162 to clear out @entity53 militias			2
instead , the @entity157 committed horrific massacres of civilians			0
contrary to what many believe , @entity26 had no knowledge that the massacres would occur			2
an @entity9 commission of inquiry found that despite previous excesses by the @entity156 militias , @entity9 had concluded that @entity157 forces had reached a stage of maturity that would " ensure that such actions would not repeat themselves			2
" given the sectarian passions , it was reckless to allow the @entity156 militias into the camp			0
the @entity9 inquiry headed by the country 's president of the @entity183 , the @entity184 , found @entity26 bore " personal responsibility " and recommended his removal from office			1
@entity9 were seething at him and their government			2
he rejected the charges and refused to step down			0
@entity9 peace activists launched protests to push for his removal			2
when a hand grenade was detonated in one demonstration , killing an @entity9 protester , @entity26 finally stepped down			1
eventually , @entity26 rose again			2
he had never cared much what people thought about him and was never one to follow ideological fashion			0
that was probably a result of his childhood			0
when he was born in 1928 , his parents had settled in a socialist farming community , but rejected their neighbors ' views on communal living			0
@entity26 and his family were outsiders in their own home			2
he learned to think for himself and follow his instincts rather than the crowd			0
he had reached the height of his career in 2006 when it suddenly ended from a massive stroke that put him in a coma			2
before his illness , @entity26 had found a new path			2
he broke with his rightist party , the @entity221 , in a rift that put him on the opposite side of other hardline stalwarts such as today 's prime minister @entity225			2
@entity26 created the @entity226 ( forward ) party ahead of elections he was poised to win in a landslide			2
when he was incapacitated , @entity226 won			0
his deputy @entity230 became prime minister and carried on with peace talks , which ultimately foundered			0
@entity26 had hand - picked @entity233 to join him in @entity226			1
she is now a leading advocate of concessions for peace and member of @entity9 's negotiating team			1
despite his missteps , @entity9 trusted @entity26 as a strong defender of their security			1
that meant that when he was prepared to take risks for peace , they were ready to join him			0
that 's why he won elections while vowing to undertake " painful compromises			0
" that 's why it was so demoralizing when he suddenly left the stage			0
israelis , including @entity225 , know that peace will not be possible without some risk - taking			0
the question is the extent of the danger they are prepared to accept			0
his life showed the complex link between security , peace and politics			0
and he showed once again that it is often the fiercest warriors who take risks for peace			0
it was another @entity9 right - wing leader , @entity268 , who made peace with @entity113			1
it was @entity272 , a respected general , who shook hands with @entity274 on the @entity276 lawn			0
it was @entity26 , an architect of the settler movement , who said settlements had to be removed			2
he left a complicated legacy , defending his country from those who would destroy it , and taking on those who disagreed with his controversial views at home			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity291			0

@entity291 : @entity3 *reflected* the history of @entity9 -- its trauma and its creativity
he took bold , risky action and made brilliant moves and disastrous mistakes , she says
@entity303 notes @entity26 's military wins , his reckless decision that ended in a massacre
she says at end of his career , he broke with hard - liners and sought solutions to conflict
