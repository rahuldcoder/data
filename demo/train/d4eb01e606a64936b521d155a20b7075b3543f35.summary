-- it 's interesting how many people have swallowed the @entity5 public relations ' bait to call the explosion from @entity8 oil rig the @entity10 oil spill			1
we need to call it what it is : the @entity5 oil spill			1
the federal government needs to take control and take punitive action against @entity5 and any negligent government regulators immediately			1
as a concerned citizen , preparedness speaker and author , and former commander of federal troops in disaster response , i watched with interest as @entity5 brought out its big pr guns to protect its brand and its platoon of expert engineers , paid by @entity5 to talk about how it happened and how they intended to fix it			1
@entity5 's reaction was much like @entity35 's when it was confronted with safety issues			2
it , too , focused on pr to protect its brand , versus telling the truth , and sent out its engineers to talk about the problem and the fix			0
the @entity43 was the first responder			0
the @entity43 's priority always is to save lives			0
they spent days looking for the 11 missing men			0
meanwhile , @entity5 took advantage of this time to make itself the authoritative voice in the news about the spill and blame other companies			1
the @entity55 government response was based on laws and rules that were created after the @entity52			2
after @entity59 , the law changed to make the offending company responsible for the cleanup			0
a fund was created that all oil companies contributed to			2
if there was an emergency oil spill , a company could draw up to $ 75 million from this fund to fix the problem			1
but the fund was meant to help small wildcat operations , not huge conglomerates like @entity5			2
sticking to that regulation was part of the problem			0
the no. 1 rule when dealing with disaster is to figure out which rules you need to break			0
rules are designed for when everything is working			0
a democracy is based on trust			0
@entity5 has proved it ca n't be trusted			2
@entity82 share views on oil spill response the government needs to change the game and make this a punitive effort			1
the government has been too friendly to oil companies			2
the government should immediately freeze @entity5 's assets and start to charge the corporation -- say $ 100 million -- each day the oil flows			1
the money could be held in a fund that @entity55 government draws on to take care of the people along the @entity97 and pay the states for doing the cleanup			1
next , @entity5 and the government bureaucrats who broke a law and put the public at risk need to go to jail			1
i remember when we were evacuating @entity107 on saturday following @entity108			0
we pushed the survivors to the airport and a major called and said the pilots refused to fly the plane without a manifest and there was trouble with weapons scanners			0
i told him to direct everyone to put the people on the planes as fast as possible , and we would to do the manifest en route or on landing			0
as a result , we flew 16,000 people out of @entity107 airport in less than seven hours			0
the priorities of the response to the spill must be to stop the flow of oil , prevent the oil from getting into the shoreline as much as possible , mitigate the effects of the oil in the ocean , and take care of the people who have lost their source of employment , such as fishermen and those in the tourist industry			1
@entity5 's job is to focus on stopping the flow of oil			1
the government needs to provide more military " command and control " of the situation			0
as @entity5 works to stop the gusher , the government must address the problem of the oil coming ashore and take care of the people affected , possibly retraining them in other jobs			1
the government could do this by using the @entity159 to fund the states so they can protect their shoreline and clean up the oil			2
then , the long - term effects of the spill must be mitigated			0
the people of the @entity97 , particularly @entity166 , are still recovering from @entity108			1
they 've been through hurricanes @entity167 , @entity169 and @entity170			0
they know hurricane season is right around the corner and this @entity5 oil spill has the potential to get much worse			1
and they do n't trust @entity5			2
in fact , the latest curse going around in southern @entity166 today is , " bp you			0
" punitive action must start immediately , with @entity5 supplying the money , from fines , to help the @entity97 get over this catastrophe			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

gen. @entity186 : this disaster is the @entity5 oil spill , not the @entity10 oil spill
@entity5 should be fined , he says , even $ 100 million , each day the oil is gushing
money from fines should be used to help @entity97 and its people recover , @entity186 says
general believes @entity5 and negligent government regulators should face jail time
