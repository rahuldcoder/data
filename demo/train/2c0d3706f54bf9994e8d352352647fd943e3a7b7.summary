-- it 's one of the smallest countries in @entity3 , and one of the poorest in the world , but @entity6 is showing the way in the development of tennis on the continent			1
ravaged by civil war since gaining independence in the 1960s , its relative recent political stability has helped it embrace a sport that is battling to maintain its foothold in the planet 's second - largest land space			2
@entity3 has not produced a grand slam singles finalist since @entity22 at the @entity23 , while @entity24 reached the semis of the @entity26 for the second time in 2003 and former world no. 3 @entity27 was similarly successful in ' 96 - 97			1
@entity28 is currently the continent 's top - ranked player at no. 35 , and yet another @entity3 -- @entity30 -- is its top woman at 92nd			1
but the future may lie in a country which is rebuilding itself after conflicts which saw more than half a million people killed and mass migrations of its fleeing population			0
@entity6 will soon open @entity3 's third high - performance tennis center , after @entity40 and @entity42 's @entity41 , plus host a series of top age - group tournaments and an international event			1
" we would like every country in @entity3 to replicate the experience of @entity6 , " the @entity47 's development projects administrator @entity46 told @entity0			1
" they are not rich , but they really wanted to have this center			0
i met everyone from the government -- the vice-president , the minister of sport , the @entity57 committee			0
they value tennis very much			2
" it 's not an attitude that 's prevalent in @entity3 , where tennis ranks below sports such as football and athletics when it comes to government funding			1
the @entity47 has three development officers across the continent and supports national tennis federations with equipment and skills programs aimed particularly at young children , but its resources are limited			1
" it 's very difficult to fight against football -- it 's the sport in @entity3 and they are doing so well , " @entity46 said			1
" in a country like @entity84 , if you speak to the @entity57 committee for funding for coaches , they say our priorities are track and field because this is where we get the medals			0
" we need more funding			0
we would love to see the governments being more committed to developing the game			0
if you look at our budget ( $ 4.3 million each year ) it 's what ( soccer 's ruling body ) @entity98 gives to maybe one or two nations			0
there 's a huge discrepancy			0
" @entity6 has also produced a potential future star in @entity105			0
the 17 - year - old was included in the @entity47 's grand slam team for @entity108 this year and surprisingly made it to the second round of the boys ' singles			2
ranked only 112th in the juniors , he received a wildcard into the qualifying draw and beat three players well above him to progress into the main section			2
it 's a small step , but has earned him a place in the team to tour @entity121 ahead of september 's @entity122 along with @entity124 's @entity123 -- who 's in her second year with the program			2
with @entity130 's @entity129 winning the 2011 @entity133 junior girls ' title , having been runner - up in @entity128 last year , there are signs that the @entity47 's development work in @entity3 is producing results			1
" we have to focus on these players who have got through the systems , who are very talented , who have big hearts , " @entity46 said			1
" when you see @entity146 or @entity123 on the court they give 200 % , they work very hard			0
we give them the right opportunity now so one day they become professional tennis players -- and then suddenly other @entity3 kids will relate to these players			1
" when @entity154 won the @entity133 in 1983 , in @entity155 and many countries kids identified and wanted to play tennis because they saw @entity154 winning			2
even to have players in the top 100 on the professional circuit , i 'm sure this is going to have a positive effect			1
" but it 's a huge step from being a good junior to a successful professional , especially in a place where travel and equipment are more expensive than the @entity170 or @entity171			1
" if you want to buy equipment in @entity3 , sometimes a city does n't even have a sports shop that sells rackets			1
if they do , it 's three times the price in @entity171 , " @entity46 said			0
the @entity180 estimated that a top - 20 junior might have only a 50 % chance of making it -- and it could take at least four years to crack the top 100 in the seniors			1
it can cost $ 70 - 80,000 a year to fund top coaching and tournament travel , so the best option for @entity3 players -- for those who have adequate schooling -- has traditionally been to win a college scholarship in the @entity170			1
that was @entity28 's route , following the likes of compatriot @entity196 and @entity199 's black siblings @entity197 and @entity24 -- who won grand slam titles in doubles events , as has their sister @entity202			0
" it 's a very good option			0
one of the problems of being in @entity3 is we 're pretty far from the tennis scene			1
the amount of flying you 're going to be doing , the expense of that is pretty high , " @entity28 told @entity0			0
" recently a lot of juniors have ended up going to college in the @entity170			1
there are a lot of tournaments there , you can play a lot of matches in the spring and during the summer you can actually go and play in the professional tournaments			2
" the 25 - year - old , now based in @entity223 , won his first @entity225 title in february at his home @entity227 , which returned to the men 's circuit in 2009 after a 13 - year absence			2
he said the tournament has provided much - needed visibility for tennis in @entity3 , where rugby , cricket , soccer and golf are dominant			1
" the toughest thing is a lack of quality exposure			0
a lot of @entity3 players are pretty sheltered when they go out there for the first time , " @entity28 said			1
" for myself it took me quite a few years to feel completely comfortable , regardless of who i was playing			0
you do n't always know the person and it 's easy to build them up in your eyes			0
you 've got to play some guy who 's got two coaches and an administrator , and you 're there by yourself -- sometimes it 's pretty daunting			0
" while @entity28 believes @entity3 needs more high - profile singles players like @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity27 to grow the game , his former compatriot @entity261 is not so sure that it will change the status quo			1
born in @entity264 , she went to the @entity266 academy in @entity267 , @entity268 , at the age of 15 in 1992 after being frustrated by her lack of opportunities back home			0
" i was already playing an age group up and winning those tournaments , and the federation did n't have any more money to send us anywhere , " the @entity170 citizen said			1
" it was an unfortunate time , it was around when apartheid ended , and if anything it should have been a time when @entity3 got the boom , but really it was society trying to figure it out -- where do we stand , where do we fit in			1
" it was a confusing time			0
a lot of people were let go of their jobs and other people were hired and tennis in @entity3 went through a dip there			1
" @entity261 was able to take up the academy place only after its owner @entity293 offered her a cut - price rate of $ 150 a week -- and even then her father had to beg the air fare from a local businessman			2
" in @entity3 i do n't think they are looking at it as a business			2
that 's kind of what hurts the most , " said the 34 - year - old , who has won six grand slam doubles titles and been ranked no. 1 in the discipline			2
" when @entity310 and i won @entity108 doubles titles in 2005 , i actually thought it would change tennis in @entity3			1
maybe there 's more important things to spend money on , maybe tennis is not important			2
" maybe it 's more important for the government to build schools			0
i 'm not there so i 'm not sure why tennis is not getting funding			2
" her disappointment with the tennis authorities in her former homeland grew when they refused to pay for her plane ticket for an important @entity333 teams match			0
" we had the opportunity to get back in the @entity333 -- and they did n't pay my ticket , " said @entity261 , who has since represented the @entity170 at the @entity57 and in @entity333			2
" we had @entity27 in the top - 10 at the time , but having a good singles player did n't raise the profile			1
i do n't know what it will take			0
" @entity261 has sponsored an under - 15 girls ' tournament in @entity3 for almost a decade , and has offered to train players for free at the tennis ranch she runs in @entity347 with her husband @entity348 , but has been disappointed with the response from @entity350			1
" in four years we 've had three kids over			0
we were there ( @entity3 ) in march and did a clinic for kids -- it was a big disappointment			1
we thought we might see the next @entity24 or @entity27 , but the talent was n't there , " she said			0
" i thought it would be a huge event , wanting to give something back , but the organization just was n't there			0
i ended up using some of the balls i brought back from @entity362			0
the facilities are the same as when i grew up			0
it 's an eye - opener that it has n't changed			0

@entity3 tennis is struggling to produce top - level professional players
aspiring stars face big *obstacles* if they are to establish themselves on tour
one of the best ways is to win a college scholarship in the @entity170
otherwise @entity3 players are not exposed to top - level *competition* while they are young
