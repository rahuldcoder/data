-- it 's not the kind of weather map or travel intelligence you want to see on the wednesday before @entity6			1
two major storms in the @entity8 and the @entity9 are complicating matters on one of the busiest travel days of the year			1
at the same time , the @entity13 and the @entity14 have issued a joint intelligence bulletin saying terrorists could choose to strike during the holidays and everyone should stay vigilant			2
@entity0 has obtained a copy of the bulletin which says law enforcement is " not aware of any credible threats to the @entity23 specifically timed to coincide with the 2011 holiday season			0
" but the bulletin notes last year 's @entity26 plot to set off a bomb at a @entity29 tree lighting			1
that one allegedly involved a homegrown suspect			0
and the bulletin says that as of february 2010 , @entity32 was considering attacks on the @entity34 on symbolic dates such as @entity29 , but there 's no information to indicate that led to actual @entity32 plots			1
these sorts of bulletins have come out at holiday time in past years			0
but this is the first once since the death of @entity44			0
meanwhile , rain has prompted flood watches in parts of @entity49 ; up to 8 inches of snow have fallen in central parts of @entity52 ; showers are soaking northern @entity54 ; and wind gusts of up to 98 mph have been reported along the @entity26 coast , @entity0 meteorologist @entity45 said			0
" it 's going to be a rough go for a whole lot of people , " she said			2
flight delays were spreading wednesday afternoon , with @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity66 's @entity65 airports reporting problems			1
check @entity70 flight delay information that 's bad news for those who are on the move for the annual november trek to see family and friends , feast on turkey and pumpkin pie , and rediscover the joys of their hometowns on @entity6			1
@entity84 projects that 42.5 million @entity34 will travel at least 50 miles during the @entity6 weekend , an increase of 4 % from last year			1
slightly fewer people are choosing to get to their destinations by plane			0
about 23.2 million travelers will fly over a 12 - day period surrounding @entity6 , a 2 % drop from last year , according to a forecast by the @entity92			1
unlike last year , when the @entity95 movement against airport body scanners threatened to snarl security lines across the country , air travelers are not facing the prospect of protest - induced delays			2
( the @entity95 turned out to be a nonevent			0
) the @entity102 says it has prepared its work force for a " smooth holiday travel experience for travelers			1
" @entity106 : tell us how your trip is going the busiest air travel days for the @entity6 holiday period are expected to be sunday and monday , the @entity92 said			1
if you 're flying into or out of @entity112 , @entity114 's @entity113 or @entity115 , brace yourself for lots of company			1
those will be the nation 's busiest airports this @entity6 , based on flight bookings , according to @entity121			1
( and in case you 're wondering , @entity123 in @entity124 and @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 , will be the least busy			0
) no matter where you start your journey , flight attendants say it 's a week when they see lots of extra-grumpy passengers worried about flight delays and cancellations			2
" there 's a little bit more at stake			2
oftentimes , people are trying to get someplace to be with their family , so naturally they would be upset if they 're not going to make it , " said @entity139 , a longtime flight attendant for a major @entity34 airline			1
" however , in general , it 's also kind of a festive time			2
sometimes , contrary to what you might think , people are in a good mood because they are going for something kind of fun as opposed to just a business meeting or something related to work			0
" should you recline your seat ? the etiquette of crowded flying flying with food or gifts ? check out the @entity102 's guide to what you can and can not bring through an airport security checkpoint			2
the agency reminds you not to wrap gifts you are taking on the plane because security officers may have to unwrap them if they need to take a closer look			0
the @entity102 also offers tips on how to get through the security line faster , including packing coats and jackets in checked bags whenever possible and putting your shoes directly on the conveyor belt instead of a bin when they go through the x-ray machine			0
then , there are things you ca n't control : @entity182 , fog or rain may mean you wo n't fly on time or at all			0
to avoid being stuck at the airport , sign up for airline alerts and check your flights frequently online before you leave home			0
if your flight is canceled , get in line for assistance and try your airline by phone or online at the same time to get an edge over other fliers who are trying to rebook			0
winter weather travel tips if you 're driving through an area that 's expecting wintry weather , @entity84 recommends that you keep at least half a tank of gas in your car at all times and pack a cell phone , plus blankets , gloves , hats , food , water and any needed medication in case you 're stranded			1
stay safe out there , and happy travels			0
