-- @entity2 governments are looking to the @entity3 and national central banks to help pare back the cost of a second rescue package for @entity7 which would otherwise amount to € 170bn			1
figures seen by the @entity0 reveal @entity7 needs € 136bn in fresh bail - out funding from the @entity10 and @entity11 -- in addition to the € 34bn left over from @entity7 's first bail - out			1
this is € 6bn more than @entity10 leaders agreed in october			0
@entity16 , the @entity17 and @entity18 have insisted on paying no more than € 130bn			0
@entity2 finance ministers , who meet in @entity20 on monday to hammer out a deal to save @entity7 from default , hope the @entity3 can contribute by forgoing some of the future profits it would earn on its @entity7 bondholdings , which it has said it is willing to do			1
senior officials said they would also discuss a possible contribution from eurozone national central banks whose bondholdings could be included in a € 200bn debt restructuring to be launched alongside the bail - out			1
@entity33 : is @entity7 facing a disorderly default ? a central bank contribution would help the eurozone and @entity11 to keep their contribution to € 130bn			2
it would also reduce @entity7 's ratio of public debt to gross domestic product in 2020 closer to the 120 per cent the @entity11 deems sustainable , permitting it to take part in a second rescue			2
in a conference call on sunday evening , eurozone finance ministry officials were still debating the terms of debt restructuring -- including whether to force more losses on private bondholders -- and how to bring down the size of the total bail - out			2
but senior officials said they believed a deal would be reached at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on monday in @entity20			1
" i do n't think there is a majority to go a different way because a different way is enormously arduous and costs lots and lots of money , " @entity56 , the @entity57 finance minister , told local television			0
pressure from the @entity66 and emerging market countries to restrict the @entity11 's exposure led to the lower contribution , according to officials familiar with the negotiations			0
@entity7 has already borrowed far more relative to its own financial contribution to the @entity11 than any other crisis loan recipient in the @entity11 's history			2
the @entity11 portion of the new package , which will be added to the remaining € 10bn in @entity11 commitments from the first @entity7 bail - out , will be converted into a lending programme with a repayment period of up to 10 years rather than the five years under the current loan			1
the € 170.5bn rescue package does not include € 35bn that will be set aside temporarily to ensure @entity7 banks can fund themselves when @entity84 is ruled in " selective default " after the restructuring			1
the new bail - out includes € 35.5bn for private bondholders as part of the debt restructuring			1
of that , € 30bn is expected to come in a direct payment to bondholders in cash or bonds issued by the eurozone 's rescue fund in exchange for writing off € 100bn in @entity7 debt			2
the remaining € 5.5bn is interest payments still owed on existing bonds , though officials are considering cutting that amount			0
opinion polls in @entity7 show the two big mainstream parties -- centre - left @entity105 and centre - right @entity106 -- continued to suffer ahead of april elections because of their support of tough austerity measures accompanying the bail - out			1
support for @entity106 dropped to 24 per cent or lower in three new polls , with @entity105 showing only at best 14 per cent -- meaning the two parties , the only to explicitly support the bail - out 's terms , would not have a majority in a new parliament			2
@entity118 , @entity119 finance minister , said on monday morning that all the elements for an agreement were in place			0
" all the elements are in place			0
both with the bankers , private sector creditors , and public sector creditors , the states and central banks , " he told @entity123 1 radio			0
though senior @entity123 officials said figures were still being negotiated , the @entity11 contribution to the new rescue will be far lower than originally anticipated			0
the figures show the @entity11 will only contribute € 13bn to the second bail - out , far less than the one - third lent in the @entity136 , @entity137 and first @entity7 bail - outs			1
" the @entity11 is expected to be stingy , " said one senior @entity123 official			0
