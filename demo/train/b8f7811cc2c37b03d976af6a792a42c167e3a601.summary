-- [ spoiler warning : if you did n't see the premiere of " @entity4 , " you may not want to read any further			1
] speedy hero @entity5 -- a.k.a. the @entity6 -- zoomed back onto tv tuesday night			1
the @entity8 unveiled its highly anticipated new fall series about the @entity6 , reviving the story of how scientist @entity5 came to be the uberswift superhero after being hit by lightning and doused with chemicals			1
the freshman series , which stars @entity16 ( " @entity17 " ) as the endearing lead , was introduced through the @entity8 's other comics - inspired series , " @entity20			1
" with that program in its third season , the @entity8 surely hopes to find another success story with " @entity4			1
" comic books invade the small screen so far , the network 's off to a great start			1
" @entity4 " is the @entity8 's highest - rated and most - watched series premiere since 2009 , with 4.5 million viewers and a rating of 1.8 in the adult demo of 18 - 49 -- not to mention that critics were also willing to give it a shot			1
" the @entity8 's ' @entity4 ' is one of the most enjoyable , agreeable and infectiously exuberant new shows of the fall , " applauded @entity36 , and @entity38 's @entity37 predicted that " @entity4 " could follow in " @entity20 's " longevity footsteps if it " can maintain the quality of the plot			1
" besides , @entity37 added , " how nice to see a superhero who counts optimism among his powers			2
" @entity48 praised the show 's lighter tone at @entity51 : " @entity16 â € ” well - scrubbed , dimpled and forthright â € ” tacks right into the fundamental good - natured decency of @entity5 and makes that into an asset			1
" that said , the last time " the fastest man alive " was on tv , it did n't work out so well			2
in 1990 , it was @entity59 who wore the iconic red suit and raced around alongside co-stars @entity61 and @entity63			2
but that series was canceled after a single season			2
@entity59 is getting a second chance at seeing the @entity6 find a home on tv in his role as @entity5 's father in the @entity8 's new version			1
according to " @entity4 " actress @entity71 , who plays @entity5 's love interest , @entity73 , everyone from the executive production team on down is " very aware of the love for @entity6			1
" " our series feels and looks like the comic book in a lot of ways , " @entity78 said			0
" the design is so incredible			0
" tuesday 's premiere saw the @entity6 facing off against his very first supervillain , the @entity88			1
( future episodes will feature more comic book villains like @entity91 and heroes like @entity93			0
) but what caught our attention the most was that surprising ending			0
why is wheelchair - bound @entity99 boss @entity98 looking at a hologram of a 2024 newspaper that carries the headline , " @entity6 missing : vanishes in crisis " ? ( that 's a reference to the 1980s " @entity106 " comic , where @entity5 died			1
) plus , what really happened to @entity5 's mother when she died ? and when will @entity5 's longtime friend / crush @entity73 learn the truth about her longtime friend ? we 're definitely on board to find out the truth about these mysteries			2
@entity118 users tended to agree : @entity119 wrote , " really enjoyed # @entity120 tonight			0
off to a great start			0
@ grantgust seems like a lead you can build a series around			0
" @ @entity126 adored the show as well			0
" # @entity120 was the best new show premier i 've seen in a long time ! " echoing many critics was @entity131			2
" # @entity120 was better than most tv superhero 1st episodes , thanks to embracing its comic roots & a generally upbeat vibe , " he said			0
we 'll see if the positive reactions continue			2
so far , so good for the @entity6			0
so what can fans look forward to next ? executive producer @entity140 told us about the villains and heroes we 'll meet this season			0
" we 've got @entity91 in @entity144 ; @entity146 ; in @entity145 we have blackout ; and in episode 8 we 've got our big crossover with @entity20			0
we 're really looking forward to that			0
