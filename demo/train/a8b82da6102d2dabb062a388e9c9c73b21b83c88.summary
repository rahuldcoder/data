-- @entity1 said tuesday he and his wife " did not party - crash " a @entity5 state dinner last week			1
the @entity7 administration said @entity1 and his wife , @entity8 , attended but had not been invited to the state dinner for visiting @entity10 prime minister @entity9 , and officials say they got into the event because of a breach in security			1

i can tell you , we did not party crash the @entity5			1
" @entity1 said he and his wife " are cooperating extensively with the @entity27 " in their investigation of the incident and said " the truth will soon come out			1
" yet @entity5 press secretary @entity32 said tuesday the @entity33 were not on an invitation list of guests			1
" if your name is not on an invitation list and you show up , in my book , that 's called crashing , " he said on @entity0 's " @entity36			2
" " the president was concerned about the security breach here , as was the @entity27 , " @entity32 said			1
" @entity46 is evaluating their procedures			2
" the @entity33 said last week that they would appear monday on @entity0 's " @entity48 , " but they later canceled after @entity0 reported thursday about several lawsuits involving the @entity33			0
the couple 's publicist , @entity50 , urged @entity0 to delay its report about the couple 's legal woes			2
" we will begin doing press and media next week providing exclusive interviews and press junkets , " @entity50 said in an e-mail to @entity0 on thursday			0

" on the " today " show , @entity32 was asked about a report that the @entity33 had an e-mail exchange with a @entity68 official and believed they had an invitation			2
" i think if you ask the @entity33 directly , they were not on a list here at the @entity5			1
their name was not in a security tower in order to get into this secure complex			0
and they had been told on a number of occasions that they did not have tickets for that dinner			2
" monday , @entity68 official @entity82 denied in a statement obtained by @entity0 that she helped try to get the couple on the list for the state dinner			1
" i did not state at any time , or imply that i had tickets for any portion of the evening 's events , " @entity50 said in a prepared statement released by a @entity5 official			1
" i specifically stated that they did not have tickets and in fact that i did not have the authority to authorize attendance , admittance or access to any part of the evening 's activities			0
even though i informed them of this , they still decided to come			0
" @entity50 is a special assistant to defense secretary @entity104 and serves as the @entity68 's liaison to the @entity5			1

@entity1 said he and his wife are " respecting " the @entity27 " timeline " and " want to get through that process			1
" they suggested there was no misunderstanding			0
" in our view , it 's clear to us			0
and based on the timeline , i think the @entity125 public is actually going to be extremely surprised with all the details that went from beginning to end into what was supposed to be a lovely , beautiful evening , " @entity1 said			0
the @entity33 also denied a report that they were uninvited guests at a @entity132 dinner in september , saying they had been invited there by a law firm and had been its guests at the dinner			1
" were we escorted out ? of course not			0
that 's another gossip rumor , " he said , saying the story got started through a gossip column			0
yet a spokesman for the @entity143 said tuesday that the couple was asked to leave the event			1
president @entity7 and the first lady also attended that fundraiser dinner , but foundation spokesman @entity148 emphasized that " at no time did mr. and mrs. @entity8 have access to president @entity7 and mrs. @entity152			1
" @entity50 said that at the @entity132 foundation 's fundraiser two months ago , he saw the @entity33 at the pre-dinner reception , and later in the evening was informed that the couple was seated at a table without tickets			1
the table was in the event 's " @entity160 , " where tables sell for $ 20,000 each , he added			0
" at that time , i went to grab a few security personnel , who were not @entity27 , " @entity50 said			2
" we walked with ( security ) to the table and just tried to sort everything out			0
when we realized they did not have tickets , the security personnel escorted them out			0
" the @entity33 -- who said they were not paid by @entity16 to make an appearance on the " today " show -- have been characterized as publicity hounds			0
they said their lives have been " destroyed " by their notoriety			0
" unfortunately , we 've been mischaracterized , you know , through the media and other paparazzi forums , and you know , our homes have been invaded , and it 's been just devastating what 's happened to @entity8 and i , " @entity1 said			0
