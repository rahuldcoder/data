@entity0 -- the past decade has seen a number of developments on the @entity5 continent -- a relative increase in political stability , modest economic growth , and the early signs of a re-emergence of a young and vocal middle class engaging actively in debates about the continent 's future			1
poverty , war and disease are still heartbreakingly common , but there is a sense of possibility that a few decades ago seemed absent			0
it is against this backdrop that 500 people interested in ideas from @entity5 will gather on december 1 in @entity25 , @entity0 , for the fourth @entity27 event to listen to 13 distinguished speakers , including @entity29 , " patient capital " investor @entity30 and writer @entity32 -- all of whom , in different ways are challenging conventional wisdom , through their work on the @entity5 continent			1
@entity27 , an independently organized @entity39 event , aims to reflect the ideas and inspired thinking of a new generation of @entity5 leaders committed to engaging and re-engaging in an active and meaningful manner with the continent			1
what started as a small event in @entity47 in 2009 has grown to become one of the premier events focusing on @entity5 in @entity0			1

in december 2005 , a @entity57 flight from @entity58 crashed as it prepared to land at @entity59			0
only two of the 110 passengers aboard survived			0
among those lost were my younger brother 's best friend from childhood , @entity63 and his young nephew @entity66			0
sitting in my office in @entity68 in @entity69 , trying to absorb the news , i was filled with a great anger and sadness which fuelled a polemic article that seemed to erupt through my fingers straight on to the page			0
the title was " why are we crying , we are all guilty " , and in it i accused all @entity55 of the negligence in our civic duties that had allowed tragedies like this to occur			0
the piece seemed to strike a chord with many @entity55 , bringing me praise and invective in equal measure , but one of the positive responses was from @entity90 , a @entity55 living in @entity92 and author of a blog called @entity95			0
he asked if he could republish the piece on his blog , i agreed and we kept in touch			0
read related : ' change is imminent ' : african ceos look to bright future months later , he sent me a link to a call for @entity5 fellowships for a @entity108 conference in @entity109 in 2007			2
i had never heard of @entity39 , but on googling it , thought that it sounded interesting			0
i forwarded the call for applications to my networks and a few months later , was informed that @entity116 and @entity117 , my friend and colleague had been selected			0
our 4 days in @entity109 were simply life changing -- we laughed and we cried and we were moved and inspired as we listened to @entity5 speakers like @entity121 , the @entity122 blogger who had set up @entity123 to bring the proceedings of the @entity122 @entity125 to the people of @entity122 for the first time , @entity128 , then @entity55 's first female minister of finance , who had just started publishing government financial allocations for the first time in @entity55 newspapers and @entity132 just on the verge of leaving her job with the @entity135 in @entity136 to set up @entity138 's first commodity exchange			1
@entity139 moved us to tears explaining why he had left a comfortable position at @entity142 to set up @entity143 , @entity144 's first liberal arts college			0
listening to them , we were confronted for the first time with so many successful @entity5 seeking to contribute in small ways to changing the way things were in @entity5			2
on leaving @entity150 , @entity117 and i started our blog , @entity152 , and 2 years later , applied for a licence to organize the first @entity27 event			1
from the beginning , we wanted to continue the conversations from @entity109 , to recreate that sense of wonder and inspiration that we had felt in @entity109 for an audience of @entity5 and friends of @entity5 in @entity0			2
that first event with 100 people in a small hall at @entity47 , largely organized on the back of our credit cards , has today grown into a greatly prized event , the only @entity169 event outside @entity5 focusing completely on the @entity5 continent			1
today , it is organized by a team of 16 dedicated @entity5 professionals from medicine , it , literature , law and ngo backgrounds , all volunteering their time to help create an amazing event aimed at inspiring new ideas about @entity5			1
at last year 's event , @entity182 , then chief executive of @entity183 , one of @entity5 's largest banks said from the stage " i have been attending conferences on @entity5 since the 80s and i have never felt the kind of energy that i am feeling in this room now			1
" for us , that was a vindication of the long hours put in to produce the event			2
from our interaction with the speakers this year , we expect tears and laughter in equal measure as we all are inspired by the @entity5 stories of another 13 amazing speakers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity27 aims to reflect the ideas of a " new generation of @entity5 leaders "
13 speakers will *discuss* how to engage with @entity5
event will *shoecase* " inspiring @entity5 stories , " says organizer @entity204
