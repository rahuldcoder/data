-- @entity1 does n't think chance explains why a bottle full of messages washed up on the shore of @entity6 , @entity7			1
@entity1 , the supervisor of a crew doing cleanup after the @entity11 oil spill , was astonished by the content of the four letters found inside the bottle last month			1
" what we found was it was about a soldier that lost his life in the @entity22 war and his family had written him a series of letters kind of sharing their thoughts and emotions , " @entity1 said thursday			1
in them , family members wrote letters to their beloved son and brother , pvt. @entity33 , 21 , a @entity34 soldier who was killed in september 2009			1
" each person when we unwound the letters , started opening one letter at a time and reading one letter at a time , " @entity1 said			1
" as we found out after about two letters the whole occasion turned real somber and we were kind of taken aback and were like , ' wow ! this is a little more than we anticipated at first			1
' " in january , @entity33 's mother , @entity47 , her son , her daughter and the latter 's boyfriend dropped the bottle in the @entity53 at @entity54 , 1,300 miles from the @entity7 coast , @entity46 said			1
it was a bottle of sambuca , his favorite , she said , and each of them sipped sambuca themselves in @entity33 's honor when the bottle was launched			1
@entity1 said finding the bottle was like something out of a @entity67 movie			1
he and the cleanup crew managed to find the family through the internet and contacted them , according to news reports			1
they also signed a t - shirt and sent it to @entity46 , @entity1 said			0
he sees a parallel between @entity33 's death and the oil spill disaster			2
" it seems too good to be true			0
both of us fighting different tragedies , " @entity1 said			0
" one in war and us fighting the battle with the oil spill			2
it just seems like it was just meant to be			0
" " it does feel like ... our crew was destined to find this bottle			1
" @entity33 's mother agrees			0
she told @entity0 's @entity89 on friday : " i think the bottle took the journey it was meant to make			2
somehow it was meant to turn up there , and with those guys			0
" @entity47 said she and her family had all but forgotten about the bottle they dropped in the ocean when they were on vacation			2

not only because you were a soldier , but more so because of the wonderful , honorable young man you were			0
