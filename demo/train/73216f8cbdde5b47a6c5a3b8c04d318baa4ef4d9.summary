@entity0 -- the lawyer for a 30 - year - old @entity4 married father of two who has admitted in a plea bargain to rape by deception said wednesday he will appeal his client 's sentence , which was handed up monday			1
" eighteen months in prison is too much , " said @entity11			1
he is representing @entity13 , a @entity4 living in east @entity0 who admitted pretending to be a single @entity17 man before having sex with an @entity20 woman			1
@entity13 already has been detained for two months , followed by about two years of house arrest , his lawyer said			1
" according to the bargain , he should be punished , but we expect him to receive community service on appeal in about 30 days ' time , " @entity11 added			2
@entity13 told @entity1 the relations with the woman , who has not been identified publicly , were consensual			1
" the girl is the one who started flirting with me and talking to me , and she is the one who wanted the thing from beginning to end , " he said			2
" i met her on a @entity0 street , she approached me and started flirting with me			2
within 15 minutes , she wanted to be with me , and we were together			0
" @entity11 described his client 's liaison in more detail : " there was a short foreplay a few minutes before ; during the foreplay , the guy tells a few lies , the lady tells a few lies			2
they both have one goal , and that is to go to bed together			0
after the sexual intercourse , which was totally consensual , the lady decides to claim that the guy raped her brutally			1
she comes to court and testifies that this was a case of rape in which there was the use of force			2
" at this stage , the defense decides to make an independent investigation			0
the investigation came up with new facts upon which the @entity63 [ district attorney ] decides to give up the claim the sex was not consensual			1
so both sides agreed that the sexual intercourse was consensual			2
however , the @entity63 still wanted to charge him with rape by deception			0
" so this is the best the defense could do in this case			2
we are appealing the very long sentence			0
" @entity13 , who acknowledged having told the woman he was single , said he is known as " @entity78 , " a nickname for the @entity17 name " @entity81 , " but also his own nickname			1
" apparently , later she discovered that i was an @entity84 and complained to the police , " he said			0
" i did not say anything or commit anything wrong , " he insisted , adding that he did not understand how his misrepresentations could result in a rape charge			0
" if i told the woman i was a pilot and later she finds out that i was not a pilot , then she goes and says that ' he raped me ' ? if i told her that i was a millionaire and it turns out that i am a poor man , then she goes and says that ' he raped me ' ? " " it is terrible , but the law says very clearly that if someone has sexual intercourse using deception about his identity to conduct the act , it can be considered rape , " said @entity96 , a lawyer specializing in civil rights and human rights cases			1
but , if the circumstances had been different -- if a religious jew had said he was not religious in order to woo a potential suitor -- " he would not be brought to court , " she said			0
" and i am not sure that , on this occasion , it is a reason to charge			0
to have intercourse in daytime in a deserted building in the center of town -- i say the circumstances speak for themselves			2
" she added , " the thing that interests me in the case is the need , the necessity , of @entity84 in @entity20 to pretend			1
to speak without an accent so as not to be seen as @entity84			0
to dress not to look like @entity84			0
" she predicted @entity13 would prevail			1
" i do n't know if he will be acquitted , but he has served his punishment , " she said			0
criminal law rarely applies to minor lies , like dyed hair or a changed name , " said @entity129 of the @entity130 for @entity131			0
" but it would apply to the more meaningful lies , " she said			0
" for example , where a doctor persuades a woman to have sex claiming it would be a part of the medical treatment			1
as for this particular case , it is not the fact that he was an @entity84 and claimed to be @entity17			1
the court emphasized the fact that he claimed to be single while he was married , which would be relevant in the context of a romantic relationship			1
" @entity13 expressed regret , but not for the alleged victim			1
" i would only be upset and regret this because i have put my wife through pain and upset her , but i did not [ do ] anything wrong with the girl			0
" his is the second conviction on the charge of rape by deception			0
in 2008 , the @entity20 @entity165 convicted @entity166 for impersonating an official in the @entity168 and promising women help and benefits to persuade them to have sex with him			1
@entity166 was sentenced to 10 years in prison			2
@entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report from @entity0 .			0
