-- @entity2 summits are often fertile ground for the most grandiose of political promises			0
true to form , this year 's one did n't disappoint : the leaders of the @entity7 and the @entity8 fired the starting gun in the race to create the biggest bilateral trade agreement the world has ever seen			1
despite tensions surrounding revelations of alleged @entity7 spying on key @entity8 figures , the talks officially kicked off this week			1
but what are the chances of such a deal coming to fruition ? read more : @entity8 envoys meet over claims of @entity7 spying on @entity25 allies and by the time each side has had its say , will the new pact really bring the benefits touted today ? at a recent event i chaired in @entity33 , former @entity35 president and one - time @entity7 trade negotiator @entity30 was skeptical			1
talk is cheap , he said , what matters is what 's achieved			0
@entity40 visit : why @entity7 now needs @entity41 more than ever one thing @entity30 was adamant about is that it will take years to get any definite deal up and running , and by the time concessions have been made the agreement is likely to look rather different to the original blueprint			1
the @entity47 -- or @entity48 for short -- is an ambitious project , designed to boost what is already the world 's most important inter-regional trading relationship			0
both partners are betting it will add generously to the 13 million or so jobs that depend on transatlantic trade , whilst boosting investment in key sectors starved of cash during the global financial crisis			1
outgoing @entity35 chief : fix eurozone make no mistake , each side needs this deal badly : to speed up the painfully slow recovery and provide an effective counterweight to @entity67 , whose cheap exports have put scores of @entity7 and @entity25 firms out of business			1
but there are limits to what each side will accept			0
the logic is by removing all tariffs on goods and harmonizing regulatory standards for the production of cars to crops , the regions will be able to create one gargantuan market for their goods and services			0
@entity89 has so far successfully lobbied to protect @entity25 's film and music industry while the @entity7 could retaliate with its own conditions , meaning the chances of a fully comprehensive framework look slim			1
@entity95 up to around $ 280 billion , the @entity48 will cement an alliance between two blocs which already account for almost half of the world 's gross domestic product			1
@entity101 : @entity7 - @entity8 trade deal not in ' our lifetime ' all this may sound great in principle but the reality is stronger @entity7 - @entity8 ties risk alienating large emerging economies that have been deliberately excluded			1
@entity67 has watched the transatlantic nations ' dubious stewardship of the world economy with increasing alarm			2
it will not take kindly to their stranglehold over world trade			2
back in @entity25 , some are already questioning whether the @entity48 's economic benefits will be evenly shared			0
a survey commissioned by @entity41 's @entity121 expected @entity7 incomes would rise 13.4 % per head thanks to the @entity48 , whereas those in @entity25 would only increase 5 %			2
even among @entity8 member states the trickle down effect is likely to be uneven with the @entity129 's economy likely to grow 9.7 % while that of @entity89 would expand just 2.6 % , the study found			2
what also remains unclear is the effect increased trade with the @entity7 would have on @entity135 commerce upon which many member states are heavily reliant			1
still , on balance , even if there are fewer crumbs to be had on its side of the table , @entity25 has the most to lose if the @entity48 does n't go through			0
why ? because it has fewer options than @entity7			2
dogged by uncomfortably high unemployment and repeated recessions , one gets the sense the @entity147 views the @entity48 rather like a " get out of jail " card			0
faced with no effective policy to tackle its issues , a crisis of leadership and a dearth of funds , @entity33 appears to believe the @entity48 will prove to be some sort of panacea			0
another unknown is whether the business community will buy into the @entity48			0
large firms often talk up the merits of free trade but shy away from the cumbersome aspects that new trading environments often offer			2
the nascent @entity7 - @entity8 trade negotiations aim to achieve much but it will take years to work out the details and by the time the @entity48 is up and running the economy will probably be back on its feet again			1
hopefully by then they will have dreamed up a new name though			0
after all " tip " is hardly a promising acronym for the biggest deal on the planet .			0
