-- @entity1 , fighter of wolves , may be the closest thing the box office has to an alpha male			0
the 59 - year - old actor 's latest thriller , " @entity6 , " debuted in first place with a better - than - expected $ 20 million , according to studio estimates			1
that places the r - rated film just below the openings of @entity1 's " taken " ( $ 24.7 million ) and " unknown " ( $ 21.9 million )			1
it also represents a major win for @entity15 , the new distributor formed by @entity16 and @entity17			0
although " @entity6 " cost a reported $ 34 million to produce , @entity15 acquired the wilderness - survival movie for just $ 5 million			1
the well - reviewed but admittedly harsh film earned a middling " b - " rating from @entity22 audiences			0

of particular interest , 67 percent of moviegoers listed @entity1 as the reason they purchased a ticket to " @entity6 , " confirming the actor 's drawing power			2
@entity1 is now taking suggestions on what animals he should confront next			0
the weekend 's two other new movies , " @entity38 " and " @entity39 , " witnessed less impressive debuts			1
both films were promoted with $ 6 ticket offers through online coupon sites ( @entity44 for " @entity38 " and @entity45 for " @entity39 " )			1
also , with @entity47 's recent acquisition of @entity48 , the studio was essentially competing against itself -- " @entity38 " is a @entity47 release , while " @entity39 " is from @entity48			1
" @entity38 , " a @entity51 action comedy starring @entity52 as a bail - enforcement agent , landed in third place with $ 11.8 million			1
that 's slightly better than what many industry experts predicted , but still represents @entity52 's worst opening since breaking out in 2007â € ²s " knocked up			0
" there 's a noticeable downward trajectory to the star 's recent box - office performance , with each of her last four films opening to a smaller amount than the movie before it			0
" @entity38 " drew an audience that was 75 percent female , and @entity22 participants gave it a " b - " grade			1
" @entity39 " underwhelmed with $ 8.3 million -- enough for fifth place			1
the @entity51 thriller stars " @entity77 's " @entity74 , who has yet to prove he can open a film without being surrounded by big - budget special effects			0
according to @entity22 , only 17 percent of audiences listed @entity74 as their reason for buying a ticket			0
if there 's a bright spot for " @entity84 , " it 's that the movie received a " b + " rating from @entity22 audiences			0
among holdovers , " underworld : awakening " fell 51 percent for $ 12.5 million			2
that 's actually the best second - weekend hold for any " @entity92 " movie			0
after 10 days , " awakening " has grossed an estimated $ 45.1 million -- more than any of its predecessors had in the same time frame			1
the @entity98 action film " @entity99 " dropped 45 percent for $ 10.4 million , bringing its two - week total to $ 33.8 million			1
also , " mission : impossible -- @entity103 " crossed $ 200 million on friday			1
after 45 days in theaters , " @entity103 " has earned $ 202.6 million and is neck and neck with " mission : @entity108 , " which collected $ 201.7 million in the same period			2
it 'll be a nail - biter as " @entity103 " attempts to pass " mission : @entity108 's " final tally of $ 215.4 million to become the franchise 's top earner			1
in limited release , " @entity117 , " starring @entity119 - nominated @entity118 and @entity120 , debuted to a mediocre $ 770,000 from 245 theaters			2
a number of @entity123 nominees expanded this weekend to take advantage of their recent nominations			0
" @entity126 , " which increased its theater count from 560 to 2,001 , jumped 176 percent to pull in $ 6.6 million			2
