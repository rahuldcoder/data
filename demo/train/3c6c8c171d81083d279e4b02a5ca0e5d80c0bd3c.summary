tails wagging wildly , tongues panting heavily , ears -- soft as felt -- flapping around as if they were wings propelling them against gravity			2
these canines are getting some much - needed freedom from their leash , running , leaping and rolling on a field at a landfill in @entity12			1
but this is no normal walk in the park for these dogs , as it might be their last			1
homeless and ownerless , these shelter dogs have almost maxed their shelf life in the local pound , and they could end up in the landfill buried with everything else people have discarded			1
this is the sad reality of a pet overpopulation problem that photographer @entity27 wishes to change through her wide lens and huge heart			1
as a last - ditch effort to save these dogs from euthanasia , her " @entity31 " project has already changed the metaphorical landscape : of the 127 dogs she has photographed on these symbolic grounds , 108 have gotten homes			1
but it 's more than just finding owners for the animals			2
she hopes to change the physical landscape as well and open the conversation about how to save these animals from a fate six feet under			2
" throwing bodies into landfill after being injected with a barbiturate is n't good for the environment , " @entity48 said			1
" my hope is that underlying that , we can figure out what to do to curb overpopulation from starting in first place			0
" @entity48 knew nothing about homeless dogs until she adopted one of her own after completing graduate school			1
her journey to shoot " @entity31 " started with a forgotten crate and a neighbor nice enough to return it			0
the two spoke for a while about rescue animals and led @entity72 to start volunteering at the local shelter in @entity74 , @entity12			1
" i was awestruck by how many animals there were and how quick the turnover was , " @entity48 said			0
the @entity78 houses animals as long as possible before they run out of room or resources to take care of them			0
" the saddest thing is there is no alternative for animal overpopulation other than euthanasia , no other tool in their arsenal , " @entity48 said			0
her first project on the shelter in 2009 , titled " @entity95 , " depicted the lethal injection process			2
she wanted to show people what happens when the animals are not adopted , and she wanted to show how hard the animal shelters work as " first responders " to " discarded property , " she said			0
years went by before she approached the subject again , but this time she took a different , more positive angle			0
instead of showing the " doom and gloom , " she wanted to show that animals could be helped out before it was too late			0
the former director of the @entity78 asked her to come out to a landfill that he was turning into a public park			2
social media follow @ @entity113 on @entity114 to join the conversation about photography			0
she paused and thought , " why is he involved in both waste and animals ? " the county animal shelter falls under the same management as the landfill			1
by law , pets are property			0
" if you do n't want your property anymore , that 's what the animal shelter is for			2
and most of the time , they then end up in landfill , " she said			1
thus , " @entity31 " was born to give man 's best friend the chance to be seen for their beauty -- and to be saved , like the wasteland - turned - park that they play on			0
@entity27 is an @entity144 photographer based in @entity12			1
