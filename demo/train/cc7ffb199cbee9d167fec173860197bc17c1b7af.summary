-- @entity1 is ceo of @entity2			1
in this role , he oversees the delivery of an aggressive investment strategy , generating significant financial returns and driving sustainable economic development in the @entity8			2
@entity1 at the signing of the february deal with @entity11 that will see @entity13 host a @entity11 race in 2009 @entity1 is also chairman of the @entity15 of the government of @entity13			2
this specialized government agency is mandated to provide strategic policy advice to the chairman of @entity13 's @entity20 , his highness @entity19 , @entity19 of @entity13			2
in addition , @entity1 is a board member of @entity22 and also holds positions on the boards of @entity25 , @entity26 and the philanthropic @entity27			1
he is chairman of @entity29 , vice chairman of the supervisory board of @entity32 and vice chairman of @entity34 , the leading @entity35 aerospace company			1
all of these organizations are wholly or partly owned by @entity2			1
@entity0 's @entity37 met @entity1 in @entity13 and began by asking him about @entity2 's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the @entity41 investment firm , @entity40 for $ 1.35 billion			1
@entity37 : in the past we 've talked about a return or a double - bottom line for @entity2 when you approach investments			1
one is a financial return , the other is a strategic return			2
how does @entity40 fit into a double bottom - line for @entity2 ? @entity1 : if you look at the areas @entity40 has focused on - aerospace , energy , power , infrastructure , transportation , healthcare - these are all areas you find @entity2 very aggressively acting in			1
and the synergies that we see , the potential partnerships that can be created through this investment are endless			2
so it 's a very good fit for us , it 's a very good deal for @entity2 and i think it 's the right step			1
@entity37 : as you know , a @entity67 firm took a non-voting stake in the @entity70 before its ipo , $ 3 billion but has seen that investment tumble			2
what makes you confident that this will play out differently for @entity2 ? @entity1 : we 've met with all the executives at @entity40 , we 've looked at their track record			1
their track record speaks for itself			2
we 're confident in all the due diligence work we 've done , and i think this investment will pay off handsomely for us in the years to come			0
@entity37 : it 's interesting , you were in @entity86 closing this deal , three weeks ago i see you in @entity87 on a real estate development and in between you 're in @entity89 with your f1 obligations in @entity35			0
i take it that speed is of the essence these days			0
you 're moving at such a rapid speed in all directions at this stage			0
@entity1 : i 'm getting used to sleeping on planes , let me put it that way			0
@entity37 : that 's an understatement			0
seriously , the speed is quite impressive			0
@entity1 : it 's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years , and the growth in @entity13 , the growth in the region and the growth that @entity2 has gone through is tremendous			1
it requires people like me , executives in this company and executives across the board to be running around and making sure we get the right deals and the right partnerships and making sure we have a sustainable growth strategy			2
@entity37 : you have a wide - ranging portfolio			2
if you look at it , it does n't seem to blend or come together			0
@entity26 energy , a huge natural gas project in this region , majority holder			1
five percent stake in @entity130			1
i mean how do we know that 's not just a vanity investment for @entity130 ? how does that fit in to your long term strategy ? @entity1 : well @entity130 has been a very exciting and interesting investment for us			1
again , right off the bat , it 's a financial investment , it makes a lot of sense , it provides the right returns for us			0
but beyond that , we created a strategic alliance with @entity130			1
two years later , we have a @entity11 in @entity13			0
that could n't have happened without that entry point , in @entity130			1
@entity26 is another great story for us because this was a project that seven years ago , was a dream			1
i remember talking to people about building a pipeline between @entity157 and the @entity8 to transport gas , and people frankly looked at me and said , " you 're nuts , that 's not gon na happen			0
" well here we are , it 's 2007 , gas is flowing from @entity157 to the @entity8 and it 's done			0
@entity37 : how do you avoid the eventual backlash here that seems to be brooding or percolating at this stage ? are there merits to the argument that this is just oil - wealth being redeployed and not a level playing field ? @entity1 : @entity2 now is focusing on creating a good corporate institution			1
it 's a totally different ball game than maybe 10 years ago or maybe 15 years ago , with the type of corporations and institutions that are now coming up in the region , and the approach they are taking in the investment strategies that they are pursuing			0
@entity37 : we are sitting in an extremely grand @entity183 , a $ 3 billion structure			0
you have an urban plan that goes out to 2030			0
what 's this going to tell us about @entity13 in this time frame ? we do n't know much about this emirate in the last 10 years			0
@entity1 : @entity13 has typically been very conservative in its approach			0
we 've always taken a lot of care towards planning , towards strategic thinking , in any sector we are involved in			0
it 's a 23 - year plan that looks at the growth of the city and makes sure that the growth of the city is in line with the aspirations of the government , with the aspirations of the people and in line with the type of developments that are being put forward from the real estate private sector and the industrial sector that is now growing at a pace that you do n't see in many other places			1
