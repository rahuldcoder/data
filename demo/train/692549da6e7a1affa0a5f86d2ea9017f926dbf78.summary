-- call it the second coming			0
@entity4 and @entity5 star in " @entity6			1
" @entity8 the spaceman first visited these parts in @entity12 's 1951 @entity11 classic " @entity6 , " when he threatened to blow us all up unless we stopped threatening to do the job for him			1
@entity8 was n't exactly greeted with open arms back then -- he was shot and hounded for his troubles -- and if the earth has moved on over the past half century , you would n't know it from the trigger - happy welcoming committee that surrounds his luminous snowball of a space craft in @entity25 's @entity24			1
where sci - fi films in the 1950s used to see red ( s ) , today they go green			0
directed by @entity29 ( " @entity30 " ) and scripted by @entity31 ( " @entity34 " ) , " @entity6 " 2.0 ditches the @entity11 theme			1
@entity8 ( @entity5 ) means to save the planet , but war is n't the problem			1
the filmmakers have come up with an effective @entity42 prologue , cutting from the @entity43 in 1928 to contemporary biology professor @entity44 ( @entity4 ) , whisked from her home by uniformed men in response to an undisclosed national emergency			0
it 's strange to think that in the final hour the government will turn to molecular biologists for guidance , though true to form ( as in the 1951 original ) the scientists are quickly overruled by the politicians			2
but once @entity8 emerges from his blubbery placenta spacesuit , the movie shifts into familiar fugitive thriller terrain and the tension slowly drains out of it			1
dr. @entity62 helps him escape to @entity63 where he can meet with an alien undercover agent in @entity65 's , and she can introduce him to a true world leader , a @entity68 laureate played by @entity69			2
if you 're going to cast a top star as an alien being , @entity5 seems a solid choice			1
he 's always been able to process human emotion with a @entity76 - like detachment			0
" this body is going to take some getting used to , " @entity8 cautions shakily in his first scene , but in fact he gets the walking - talking thing down pat in no time			1
he 's a messianic figure -- he fires lasers out of his wrists , like a reverse - stigmata and he has the power to resurrect the dead ( though unlike @entity87 , @entity8 killed the guy in the first place )			1
the climax even includes a plague of robotic locusts			0
but the movie never comes up with a convincing explanation for why his superpowers do n't extend to , say , picking up a telephone			0
apparently the aliens have been monitoring us for at least 70 years , but @entity8 is taken aback to discover our emotional side			1
mostly he learns this from @entity101 , who plays dr. @entity62 's stepson @entity102			2
it 's not necessarily a good emotional side : @entity102 is a whiny , obstinate and disobedient little boy that would lead most extraterrestrials -- and not a few of the rest of us -- to reach for the destruct button			0
still , it 's surely remiss to wipe out the species before lending an ear to @entity114			0
the original movie is beginning to show its age , but at least it holds up as a story			0
that 's more than you can say for a preachy , draggy blockbuster that espouses a radical message of @entity123 technophobia at the same time as it conspicuously plugs @entity124 and @entity125 , and dresses up its half - baked thinking in blinding ( but not that brilliant ) cgi wizardry			2
@entity128 used to joke that his 1964 bomb " @entity131 " was so bad it was transferred to flammable nitrate film stock			0
if they 're so determined to be green , perhaps the producers of " @entity6 " would consider something biodegradable			2
" @entity6 " is rated @entity135 and runs 103 minutes			2
for @entity137 's review , click here .			0

" @entity6 " a remake of 1951 classic
@entity5 plays @entity8 , alien come to earth to tell humanity to *straighten* up
new version suffers from preachy script , long , dull scenes
