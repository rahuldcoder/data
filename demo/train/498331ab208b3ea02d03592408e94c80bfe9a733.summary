-- a week after dropping its invite - only requirement and letting the masses sign up for accounts , social - bookmarking service @entity1 has made another expansion , this time to @entity7 devices and the @entity8			1
@entity1 is a visual bookmarking tool for collecting and organizing content you find online by theme , such as women 's hats , cake recipes , cat photos or motorcycles			2
users mark , or " pin , " sites they like and make carefully crafted collections that other people can view and share			0
since it launched last year , @entity1 has only been available on the @entity23 and through its popular @entity25 app. as the company rolled out new features and expanded into additional languages , it has heard one request back from users : make an @entity7 app. on tuesday , the company announced three new @entity1 apps , starting with its first @entity7 offering			1
the engineers at @entity1 built the free @entity7 app from the ground up and optimized it to work on the large range of available @entity7 tablet and smartphone devices			1
no matter what size device you use , the app 's design is the familiar cascade of tiled images			0
the app is available in the @entity48 store and is expected to be in the @entity48 later this week for @entity50 owners			0
the @entity8 also got its own @entity1 app , a speedy experience with some nice new user interface touches			1
swiping to one side brings up the list of categories , the other direction flips through the layers of pins you 've opened			0
there 's an embedded browser in the @entity8 version of the app. double clicking on a product such as a pair of shoes will take you to the brand 's site within the @entity1 app , and you can then see what other product users have pinned from the same company			1
" it 's a really different kind of browsing experience , " said @entity1 co-founder @entity75 , who told the story of first seeing @entity77 demo the @entity8 while reclining in a chair			1
" it was really amazing because he was using that device exactly how we thought @entity1 would be used sometime in the future			2
" the @entity25 app got a refresh , which @entity75 said will increase stability and speed			0
it has an updated design that lets you view two columns of pins			0
the company announced the mobile news at a gathering in its new @entity97 office space			0
the summer - themed event featured paper lanterns , finger sandwiches and stations inspired by popular @entity1 topics -- a polaroid photo booth with mustache props , diy postcards , temporary tattoos and a design - your - own terrarium table with the ultimate @entity1 staple , mason jars			2
the event was one bluegrass band short of being the ultimate hipster wedding			0
an in - person announcement is a departure for @entity1 , which typically rolls out features slowly and announces them on its blog			1
however , the shift to mobile and the gathering of people tied into its newest theme : using @entity1 to do more in the real world			2
" our goal is to actually get you offline , to get you to go out , " said @entity1 co-founder and ceo @entity125 , citing the large amount of do - it - yourself actionable content people pin on @entity1			2
the site 's growth has leveled off in recent months after its meteoritic rise from 1.03 million unique monthly users in the @entity135 in august 2011 to 17.8 million in @entity136 in july , @entity1 had 23.3 million unique users in the @entity135 , according to research firm @entity138			0
that number is likely to jump again as @entity1 reaches for new audiences with its anyone - is - welcome phase and trio of mobile apps .			1
