in 1610 , after he built his telescope , @entity0 first spotted enormous @entity5 's gigantic rings			1
more than 400 years later , astronomers have in a sense dwarfed that discovery with a similar first			0
using powerful optics , they have found a much larger planet - like body , @entity12 , with rings 200 times the size of @entity5 's , @entity15 and @entity17 astronomers said			1
it lies some 400 light - years away from @entity19			0
for decades , scientists have believed that many moons around large planets formed out of such ring systems			1
but this is the first one astronomers have observed outside of our solar system , they said			1
it was discovered in 2012 , but a detailed analysis of its data was recently completed and published			0
if @entity33 were in our solar system , it would dominate @entity19 's nightly sky			1
" if we could replace @entity5 's rings with the rings around @entity41 , they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon , " said @entity36 from the @entity17 ' @entity37			1
unlike @entity0 peering a relatively short distance through his simple telescope , today 's astronomers ca n't eyeball the rings hundreds of light - years away			2
but using two very powerful optical devices with eight cameras each , they can observe the effect the rings have as they pass across nearby star j1407 -- written without a ' b ' at the end			0
it is similar to our sun. the rings of planet j1407b eclipse its light			0
with the enormous size of the rings , the eclipse the astronomers observed lasted 56 days			2
but the star did not go completely dark for nearly two months			0
some of @entity12 's 30 rings are denser , blocking more light , and some of them are less dense , letting more light through			0
and there are gaps between the rings , leading the scientists to theorize that " exomoons " have formed and cut clean orbits through the debris , like the moons around @entity5			1
our own solar system 's ringed giant has at least 60 moons , according to @entity83			1
like its system of rings , planet @entity12 is also much larger than @entity5 , said astrophysicist @entity87 , whose team at the @entity89 discovered the object			1
" you could think of it as kind of a super @entity5			2
" it is called a brown dwarf , a size classification somewhere between a planet and a star , according to the @entity99			0
brown dwarfs are hot but do n't burst into nuclear fusion the way stars do , so they do n't give off light			0
the scientists are calling on amateur astronomers to keep an eye on star @entity108 in hopes they may observe the rings eclipsing it again and report the results to the @entity114 , which collects astronomical data on " stars that change in brightness			2
" and astronomers will also search for more such ringed systems .			0

scientists have long believed many moons formed from @entity5 - like rings
this is the first time such a system has been spotted outside of our solar system , astronomers say
