-- as you struggle to read this with that one sleepy eye just barely open , you 're probably deep into your post-thanksgiving tryptophan coma , sitting peacefully on the sofa with a laptop balanced by your gut			1
maybe you 're still trying to rationalize the fact that your projectile shirt button flew across the dinner table and killed @entity11			1
" at least he died so i could have more gravy			1
" " he would 've wanted it that way			1
" but do n't worry			1
nobody blames you for murdering @entity11 ; everyone 's just too happy to see your sweet punim back at home			1
they love you , and it 's good to spend quality time with your family during @entity25			2
besides , if you get it over with now you wo n't have to suffer again for another year			2
think of it like an annual physical			2
just turn your head to the left and give @entity31 a kiss			2
of course , the only real alternative to being fat , sleepy and useless in the living room is to actually get out of the house and do some early holiday shopping with the masses			2
which is a terribly misguided idea because ( a ) it involves being around other people and ( @entity41 ) putting on pants			1
most retailers sort of require that			2
the bottom line is that there 's no real point being out in public at this stage of the food coma			2
and , so long as you 've got the laptop out , you might as well join us in 2012 and do all your shopping the way @entity57 intended : online , half - awake and fully bloated			1
@entity58 ! and , hey , just to make it even easier , i 've already uncovered a great trending gift that , while not necessarily new , has gained renewed popularity on the interwebs			1
it 's called the @entity65			1
essentially , this thing serves as a bedtime substitute for the missing man in your life			2
feel the warmth and security as you curl its plush arm around your body and rest your head on the half - chested slab of memory foam that oddly happens to be wearing a full button - down shirt to bed			1
maybe he just came home drunk from happy hour			0
oh , but you do n't care			0
" mmmm , let 's go to sleep			0
what do you say , sexy @entity65 ? " " i want a @entity89			1
" for those who prefer the comfort of a woman in bed , they also make the @entity95			0
it 's essentially the same idea as the male version , but this one has large , and astonishingly disproportionate , memory foam breasts			1
the other major difference is that ( shocker ) the @entity95 is n't wearing a shirt , because , clearly , this was designed by a man			1
and likely one who reads @entity105			0
so , if you 're actually interested in buying one of these pillows , both the male and female versions run about $ 30 and are sold by a company called @entity112			0
even if you 're not interested , you might still find amusement from the descriptions on their website			0
in promoting the @entity65 , they write : " this fun and cozy snuggle pillow is excellent for people whose partner is away on military leave or work absence			1
singles , who desire to feel the touch of a man , without actually having to be with one , will love it too			0
" it 's the second part that concerns me : " ... without actually having to be with one			0
" are we men really that bad ? let 's just allow their product overview for the @entity95 to answer that : " ... maybe you enjoy a better sleep when you locate your neck in your girlfriend or wife 's breast			0
it appears we are , in fact , horrible people			1
but at least we 're consistent			0
so , if giving weird , possibly inappropriate gifts is your thing , hop online before they 're all gone on cyber monday			0
and maybe get one of these for your dear , sad auntie			0
perhaps she 'll enjoy having someone next to her in bed again			0
of course , there 's no replacing @entity11			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			0

the @entity65 , while not new , is a trending topic *recently*
the person - shaped , memory foam pillow is designed for lonely people
the pillow , " oddly , happens to be wearing a full button - down shirt "
