did you cut your cable but miss recording your favorite shows ? @entity3 might have the answer			2
the dvr company announced a new , $ 50 device that lets cord - cutters record over-the - air network shows and watch them later on their televisions			1
the @entity10 ( the @entity11 stands for " over the air " ) can record and store programs aired by @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and other networks			1
it also connects to web services , including @entity23 and @entity24			1
" we recognize some viewers opt not to receive the benefits a subscription with a cable provider offers , " @entity3 chief marketing officer @entity25 said in a news release			0
" @entity11 makes sure that they , too , can get a best in class dvr experience through an antenna			0
" the announcement comes two months after the @entity35 ruled that @entity36 , a similar service , violated copyright laws			1
@entity36 captured shows from the broadcast airwaves and let users stream them digitally to their computers , smartphones or tablets			2
the difference , @entity3 says , is that the @entity11 uses devices in the home to record video , instead of recording it outside the home then streaming it to digital devices			1
" the technology is not anything new , " @entity3 spokesman @entity53 told @entity54			0
" we never had legal challenges regarding recording content in the home for an individual consumer			0
" @entity3 's news release was printed under the title , " simple , @entity64			0
" you know you 're in peculiar times when an established digital company makes a point of clarifying that its new product is legal			0
while still dwarfed by the nation 's millions of homes with cable , a growing number of consumers have begun " cutting the cord " in recent years -- opting to rely exclusively on network broadcasts and streaming web services like @entity24 , @entity79 and @entity23 for their movie and tv show needs			1
the @entity11 can record up to four programs at the same time and has 500 gb of storage , enough for 75 hours of high - definition recordings			2
it will be available september 14 in a limited release at @entity88 stores , with more availability , presumably , if the product succeeds in those markets			0
one thing that cable - haters may not love : in addition to its $ 50 price , the @entity11 comes with a $ 15 monthly fee and a minimum one - year subscription			1
that 's still a lot less than most cable packages , but one more fee to pile on top of those other web - content subscriptions .			0

@entity3 *unveils* the @entity10 to record network shows
the device is $ 50 with a $ 15 monthly service fee
it also records web content like @entity24 and @entity23
@entity11 rolls out two months after @entity35 ruled against @entity36
