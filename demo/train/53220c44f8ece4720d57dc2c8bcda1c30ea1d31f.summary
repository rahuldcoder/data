@entity0 -- the @entity3 must release its visitor logs and can not hide behind a shield of privilege , a federal judge ruled monday			1
the @entity8 administration has resisted public disclosure while it fights a lawsuit over alleged political influence by conservative @entity13 leaders			1
the @entity8 administration has been fighting the release of @entity3 visitor logs			2
@entity17 district court judge @entity16 concluded the information is part of the public record and is subject to disclosure under the @entity22 as " agency records			1
" " because the @entity25 creates , uses and relies on , and stores visitor records , they are under its control , " said @entity16			1
he ordered the @entity25 to produce records within 20 days			2
the @entity3 claimed exclusive control of the documents , subject to the complete discretion of the president over their release			2
@entity25 records have been an important tool for advocacy groups and members of @entity39 seeking information on the inner workings of the executive branch			1
congressional investigators used the records a decade ago in their investigations of the various @entity47 scandals involving president @entity48 and his associates , as well as allegations of influence peddling by the @entity48 campaign in the 1996 elections			2
@entity54 , a self - described government watchdog group , sought the visit records of prominent conservatives @entity57 of @entity58 , @entity59 and seven others including the late televangelist @entity61			2
" @entity54 is pleased that the judge saw through the @entity3 's transparent attempts to hide public documents from the @entity17 people , " said @entity62 , the group 's executive director			1
" we look forward to sharing the documents we obtain through this lawsuit			0
" the @entity3 and @entity71 had no immediate reaction to the ruling			0
separate legal action by @entity54 and other groups , including @entity76 and the @entity77 , sought @entity3 visitor logs that listed lobbyist @entity79			1
he pleaded guilty last year to public corruption charges			0
the @entity3 and the @entity25 in 2006 signed an agreement that visitors to the @entity3 complex were not subject to public disclosure			1
that " memorandum of understanding " was disclosed during legal action over the @entity79 records			1
@entity16 called that a " self - serving " agreement because it was issued after the records were created and after the @entity54 lawsuit			0
the judge , in a separate ruling monday , said he lacked the authority to order the @entity25 to stop destroying its visitor records once copies were turned over to @entity3 officials			1
but @entity16 noted the @entity97 had to approve any destruction of the logs			0
another federal judge in @entity0 ordered the release of @entity25 logs of visitors to vice president @entity105 's office			2
@entity105 claimed those logs were subject to executive privilege			0
that ruling is being appealed			0
@entity16 noted the @entity25 has an important " protective mission " when compiling electronic information -- including background checks -- of those seeking to enter the @entity3 complex			1
but he said the agency 's claim of " limited use " of the data does not mean the records are not subject to judicial review			0
" this does not mean the @entity25 does not read or rely on them , " wrote @entity16			0
" if that were the case , any convenience store patron who has ever bought a losing scratch ticket could claim they did not gamble simply because they held the ticket for only a few minutes			0
" the issue of @entity3 privilege over visitor logs has not been fully addressed by the @entity130			0
the case decided monday is @entity54 in @entity0 v. @entity17 @entity132			0

judge : @entity25 - controlled log is public under @entity22
@entity3 *battling* suit alleging influence of conservative @entity13 leaders
separate legal action finds *convicted* lobbyist visited @entity3
records have been a key investigative tool for advocacy groups and @entity39
