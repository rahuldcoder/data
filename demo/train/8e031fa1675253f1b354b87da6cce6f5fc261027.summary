@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's opposition said sunday that it will not " commit political suicide " by entering into a government with president @entity6 without the power to deliver change , food and jobs			1
@entity1 president @entity6 , in a speech to supporters saturday , refused calls to step down			1
@entity16 spokesman @entity15 made that comment after his party 's national executive meeting and ahead of talks slated for monday on forming a government of national unity			1
last september , @entity6 and @entity16 leader @entity23 signed a power - sharing deal , but they have not formed a government of national unity			1
the agreement , brokered by former @entity30 president @entity29 on behalf of @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , stalled as @entity23 accused @entity6 of grabbing all key ministries such as defense , information , foreign affairs , finance and home affairs			1
@entity30 president @entity38 , chairman of the regional body @entity31 , is coming to @entity1 monday with his predecessor , @entity29 , and with @entity42 leader @entity41 to try to resolve the impasse			1
in an interview with @entity2 , @entity15 said of monday 's planned meeting : " we can not go into positions of authority without the attendant and consequent power to enable us to deliver on change , food and jobs			1
" it is an act of political hari - kari , political suicide , and we are not ready to commit suicide yet			0
we can not commit political suicide by entering into a government limping and in pain			0
it 's like swallowing poison and we become the victims			0
" we are going to insist on the outstanding issues , which are to do with equity of ministries , making sure that we attain the position of governors in line with march 29 election and therefore we are going to insist and stick to our position and we hope mister @entity6 and @entity72 will appreciate the nobility of our very vital position			2
" @entity72 is @entity6 's party			2
describing monday 's planned meeting as a " watershed , " @entity15 said his party wanted the protracted talks to end			2
@entity6 told the state media that monday 's meeting would be the final one , and that he would form a government without the opposition if no agreement was reached			1
@entity15 responded by saying : " @entity6 is a failure and can not dictate pace			0
if they choose to terminate the talks by their arrogance , let it be , we will not give @entity6 latitude to be funny			1
" we are the winners and therefore we should be indicating which issues to deliberate on			0
so we will not give mister @entity6 latitude to be funny because there is no time for that , people are suffering			2
" the agreement , under which @entity6 would remain as @entity1 's president and @entity23 would become prime minister , follows last june 's hotly disputed presidential runoff , which was marred by more than 200 deaths , mainly among opposition supporters			1
@entity23 had won the first round in march , but failed to reached the threshold required			0
the deal is seen by many as the panacea to the plethora of problems facing @entity1			2
the once prosperous nation is facing its worst economic and humanitarian crisis			0
acute shortages of essentials have raised inflation , now the highest in the world			0
the @entity116 says more than five million people face starvation and there is no food aid			0
added to that , a cholera outbreak has claimed more than 2,200 lives as the country fails to import adequate stocks of chemicals to treat the water			0
the epidemic has coincided with a strike , now in its fourth month , by doctors and nurses demanding a salary review , more medicines and better hospital equipment			0
@entity23 returned home saturday and said he was committed to a power - sharing deal with @entity6 , despite recent threats to abandon the deal			1
but he vowed that he would not be rushed to join an inclusive government .			0
