@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 military is ordering that soldiers crossing from @entity6 into @entity1 be returned home at a faster rate , a move that comes as commanders work to break up a bottleneck of troops who have been pouring across the border ahead of a year - end deadline to withdraw , @entity2 has learned			1
" the order is to have these soldiers off the ground in @entity1 as soon as possible , " a military official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity2			1

" they do n't want these soldiers sitting around here			1
" the official did not immediately know whether the military was moving up or adding flights for troops from @entity1			2
the order follows president @entity32 's announcement last month that he would pull virtually all troops from @entity6 by year 's end , meeting the terms of a @entity4 - @entity6 security pact that set a december 31 , 2011 , withdrawal deadline			1
the president 's announcement followed news that negotiations to extend the deadline broke down after @entity6 's top political leaders refused to grant @entity4 troops legal immunity , opening up the prospect of soldiers being tried in @entity6 courts and being subjected to @entity6 punishment			1
of the approximate 11,000 troops in @entity6 , down from the 50,000 three months earlier , only about 150 will remain after the deadline to assist in arms sales , a @entity4 official previously told @entity2			1
@entity53 for most troops will require them to cross from @entity6 , either by convoy or airplane , into @entity1			2
there , they will turn in equipment before starting the journey back to the @entity4			2

about 1,200 troops are permanently based at @entity0			0
the population has swelled , at times , to more than four or five times that number			0
to accommodate the influx , the dining facilities extended hours of operation , expanded retail hours , opened a second @entity81 , and increased the number of cleaning crews			0
" we increased the space available for housing troops , as well as doubled our space for units to perform the administrative work they need to do to redeploy , " said lt. col. @entity84 , commander of the 134th @entity85 , a @entity87 - based @entity86 unit deployed to @entity0			0
" we also increased showers and latrines to make sure we had enough			0
" in @entity6 , a @entity4 military spokesman says every step in the withdrawal is a " deliberate operation in which we collect intelligence , coordinate with the @entity101 , clear routes and ensure that every convoy has ground security and air cover			1
" " we take that approach because force protection is inherent in every one of our operations , and we 're going to do everything we can to protect our troops , " army maj. gen. @entity106 , the senior military spokesman for @entity107 , told @entity2			0
@entity106 said the @entity4 withdrawal is on track , with all troops out of @entity6 by year 's end			2

" as a result , we 're able to get them on a plane headed home quicker than before , " he said			0
meanwhile , the @entity4 military is moving tens of thousands of pieces of equipment , including armored vehicles and equipment to counter improvised explosives , across the border from @entity6 to @entity1			1
more than 5,800 armored vehicles are expected to pass through @entity0 by year 's end , though it will take months more before the equipment is either shipped back to the @entity4 or @entity138 , said lt. col. @entity139 , a liaison officer with the team overseeing the receipt and shipment of equipment at @entity0			1
