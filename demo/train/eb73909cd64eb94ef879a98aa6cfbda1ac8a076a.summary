@entity0 , @entity1 -- the woman who stopped a plot by conservative activist @entity5 to embarrass a @entity2 reporter said @entity5 's latest statement on the matter is " clearly not true			1
" in an e-mail to @entity2 , the former executive director of @entity5 , @entity10 , wrote : " it 's clearly a pr statement for damage control			1
it 's clearly not true but what can you do			2
" @entity10 was reacting to @entity5 's explanation of what he said would have happened on his boat in august after he agreed to meet @entity2 investigative correspondent @entity21 , who was working on a documentary about young conservative activists			1
the documentary , " @entity25 , " which aired this past weekend , revealed that @entity5 had planned to " faux seduce " @entity21 by setting up the boat with hidden cameras and sexual props			1
the details of his plan were contained in a 13 - page " @entity36 " document obtained by the network , which also aired a series of e-mails that @entity5 had sent to @entity10 about getting @entity21 on his boat			1
the meeting with @entity5 was scheduled at an address in @entity39			2
the location turned out to be a private home			0
@entity5 's boat was docked behind the house			1
in a two - sentence statement prior to the airing of the documentary , @entity5 said he did not write the document and that he " found certain elements highly objectionable and inappropriate , and did not consider them for one minute following it			1
" in a statement posted monday on his @entity5 website , @entity5 again asserted he did not intend to carry out the plan as specified in the document			1
" when the @entity2 idea was pitched to me , i 'll admit that i liked the basic absurdity of meeting @entity21 on a boat and the idea of counter-seduction satire executed in a tame , humorous , non-threatening manner , " @entity5 's statement said			1
" after all , as all liberal reporters do , she was trying to ' seduce ' ( a metaphor ) me so she could get more for her story			2
it would be fun , i thought , to turn the tables in jest			0
however , i was repulsed by the over-the - top language and symbolism that was suggested in the memo that was sent to me , and never considered that for a moment			0
" @entity5 explained in his statement how his version of the " @entity36 " plan would not put @entity21 in a " threatening situation			1
" " she would have had to consent before being filmed and she was not going to be faux ' seduced ' unless she wanted to be			0
if a @entity2 reporter would be willing to engage in such a folly , it might even be more newsworthy than ' @entity82 firing			1
( @entity2 also has @entity83 on payroll			2
he 's done more outrageous things than anything i 've ever gotten in my in - box )			0
" the @entity36 document lists @entity89 [ @entity90 ] as the author and @entity5 [ @entity92 ] as the activist			1
@entity94 is a fellow activist and one of @entity5 's mentors			1
the plan involved getting @entity21 aboard a boat filled with sexually explicit props -- including sex toys , condoms , fuzzy handcuffs and pictures of naked women -- and then recording the session to embarrass @entity21 and @entity2			1
the detailed document even outlined possible " concerns " and " potential problems " associated with the plan			2
" if @entity2 gets advance warning and you find this out , you should simply cancel the operation , period			2
... if she refuses to get on the boat , " the document states , " just leave			0
you 're in a position of strength			0
make her come to you			0
to leave the boat kills the operation			0
" it also warns against " running the operation without props and with a dirty boat			0
" " in the rush to get this done , the temptation will be to skimp on the details , and that just puts two things at risk : 1 ) @entity21 's confusion as to whether this is legitimate , ruining her reaction which is key to the operation , and 2 ) making the video that much less interesting lacking props and proper ambiance			0
" @entity5 asked @entity21 to meet him in @entity39 to discuss an upcoming video shoot related to her project about young conservatives			2
according to a phone conversation that @entity5 taped , he wanted to have a " face - to - face " meeting with @entity21 , and said he felt more comfortable if she were to come to the meeting alone			2
when @entity21 arrived , @entity10 told her that @entity5 had prepared an elaborate plan to " punk " her			1
@entity2 's documentary revealed a series of e-mails , which appear to show @entity5 's intentions			1
in one e-mail to a colleague , written several days before @entity21 's scheduled meeting with @entity5 , he forwarded an audio recording from the phone conversation he taped without @entity21 's knowledge			1
@entity5 wrote : " getting closer			2
audio attached of conversation with @entity21			0
what do you think of her reaction guys ... @entity89 , you think i could get her on the boat ? " in a different e-mail to @entity10 , @entity5 gives her specific instructions to help him prepare for the meeting			1
" please go to fedex and print out pleasure palace graphic on large banner , " @entity5 wrote , " needs to be ready by late tonight -- if possible ... " those emails contradict @entity5 's latest statement , in which he says he did not implement plans detailed in the document			1
" i do believe that @entity10 , who came to ms. @entity21 with the documents and the story , was simply trying to protect me and the organization from a dangerous and objectionable plan , one sent to me in my personal emails that she assumed , wrongly , and probably due to my own lack of communication to her , that i was going to implement , " @entity5 wrote in his statement			1
" nothing in the document was implemented			0
" in a statement released through @entity2 , @entity21 said , " i am not interested in debating @entity5 about what his plans were for me on his boat			1
his statement reinforces what we reported in our documentary			0
" the other part of the @entity36 document explained how to trick @entity2 into reporting a false story about the @entity195 or @entity196			1
the plan involved @entity199 rep. @entity198			0
" certain past topics , such as the war or terrorism , seem to be relatively off the radar as it regards to the news interest of the mainstream media , " the document states			0
" things that are on politics , the @entity207 , scandal , race issues , are all pertinent and relevant			0
" " if we were to offer @entity2 evidence of racism , playing on these currently relevant issues , and produced enough supporting evidence to prove the claim we make , have them write a story and then prepare our allies to pounce , it could be a good way to undercut their credibility , " the document reads			2
it suggested creating false evidence and documents			0
" the false video evidence , for one , could be focused on the incident with congressman @entity198 where he said he was called a n --- -- by tea party protesters , even though the video evidence disproved his claim ... spoofing video evidence proving @entity198 ' claim , along with a good story that the tea party had suppressed such evidence , might be enough for @entity2 to report on the story			2
" " the video evidence just needs to be simple , just @entity198 walking by with a faint n --- -- said in the background , yelled by someone there			0
the video evidence would need to be sufficient to get by potential fact - checkers at @entity2 who might analyze the video and audio			2
" the document states that " the danger is , of course , that the lie becomes the official truth , and so it would be necessary to immediately deconstruct this story on friendly networks and media outlets			0
the goal is n't to draw out the scandal after all , rather just to embarrass @entity2 by having them report a false story			2
so immediately reporting on the falseness of the story would be key			0
" @entity5 's statement did not address this part of the " punk			1
" " i can assure my supporters and my misguided adversaries that @entity5 will continue to work to produce the investigative reports that @entity2 and others in the mainstream media have failed to deliver			1
it 's time to get back to work			0
projects will be released soon			0
that inbox is getting full again			0
" and you never know what bizarre idea i 'm going to need to reject next			0
