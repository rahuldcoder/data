@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity7 , the thought of another massive tropical storm bearing down on his home in @entity0 is traumatic			1
the 46 - year - old fisherman lost 11 members of his family , including his wife , his three children and his mother , when @entity14 lashed the central @entity1 in november last year			1
follow : @entity15 ' we were n't prepared last time			0
we were confident we 'd be safe because we have a stone house and everything we need with us , " he said			0
" but we did not expect that a storm surge would be coming and take all our family away			1
we were not given information that a great wave would come			0
" tragically , only six of his family members were ever found -- and they 're now buried close to his modest home			1
it 's difficult to look @entity7 in the eyes			1
it 's impossible to understand what he has been through			1
escaping the coast a year on and what remains of his family are leaving their homes to move inland to stay with relatives			1
" i 've been following developments on the radio this time , " he said			0
" the government is now providing better information			0
i 'm scared but at least i know what is going on			0
yesterday , the mayor visited us and told us to vacate our homes for our safety			0
" @entity0 's mayor , @entity51 , has ordered the forced evacuation of several coastal " barangays , " or neighborhoods as a precaution -- hundreds of people			1
these areas are usually made up of rudimentary shacks -- exactly the type of structures washed away during @entity14 -- owned by many of the area 's poorest residents			1
the local police are now doing sweeps of the area ensuring that people comply , with women and children being prioritized and taken to dozens of evacuation centers around the area -- part of a massive operation across the country that has seen almost half a million people in the path of storm moved to safety , according to the @entity79 ( @entity79 )			2
" when i took the decision a few days ago to close schools , people questioned me			2
but now they realize i wanted students to have time to return to their families in other areas so that they could prepare properly , " said @entity51			0
he said one of the biggest problems last year was the sheer volume of people they had to help			1
" many were coming in from outside @entity0 and saying they were from here , " he said			0
" when we asked them which barangay they came from , they said ' @entity96 or 23 ! ' but when we asked the barangay captain if he knew them , he 'd often say no. " but for humanitarian reasons , we 'd have to shelter them			0
but we could only do this for a day or so then send them away			0
" @entity103 subdued ahead of storm it 's now saturday morning and the center of @entity0 should usually be a bustling hub of activity , the scene is eerie			2
barely a handful of people are on the streets , with most businesses shuttered			2
the few shops that remain open seem to have plentiful supplies on their shelves , and no real queues to speak of			0
people respect what they 're being told			1
@entity14 is all too fresh in the memory			1
like many others people in @entity0 , it took @entity7 months to rebuild his home -- and his life -- after such an appalling tragedy			1
sadly he expects to rebuild his home once again if the storm reaches anything like the velocity it did a year ago			2
even if @entity134 -- known as @entity135 here -- hits further north as current predictions suggest , the sheer size of it will be felt here in @entity0			1
@entity7 seems resigned to this			1
we fear this typhoon will destroy everything again , " he said			0
" we 're still rebuilding and now another typhoon is coming			2
" asked if he 's considered moving away from an area prone to these kind of destructive storms , he replied : " no , i ca n't do anything because my life is here			2
i work on the sea			0
" but now we 're willing to evacuate when we hear about these storms			0
" and that is the biggest difference between this year and last .			0

fisherman @entity7 lost 11 family members during @entity14 last year
as @entity134 approaches , he 's worried about what he may lose next
last year @entity14 whipped up waves , catching people off guard
this year they 're heeding *warnings* to take precautions , to leave if possible
