@entity0 -- there is an old joke in the @entity4 that goes like this : one of @entity7 's advisers finally gets the courage to say , " mr. president , maybe it 's time to think about your farewell address to the @entity14 people			1
" @entity7 looks at the adviser and asks , " why ? where are they going ? " in reality , @entity7 got the message loud and clear			1
now , this leader , who for decades has been not just the symbol of @entity14 but a dominant voice in the @entity4 , will be leaving , and nobody is sure what will emerge in his wake			1
the effects will be felt not just in the @entity4 but back in the @entity27			1
today , the @entity27 has less leverage in the region than ever before			1
at talks last month in @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity30 showed the @entity27 and its allies that it will remain defiant on its nuclear program in the face of tough sanctions			1
@entity38 is in the throes of a dangerous game of brinksmanship that threatens to send the country back into civil war after @entity44 , supported by @entity45 and @entity30 , brought down the @entity27 - backed government of prime minister @entity47 and installed billionaire businessman @entity48 as its choice for the job			1
in @entity52 , a strongman president has been ejected , but he was also key to @entity27 anti-terror efforts in the country that harbors an active and threatening subset of @entity56			1
reform in the @entity4 was an important item at the outset for the @entity61 administration			1
president @entity61 received international goodwill upon taking office , for simply not being president @entity64			0
he flew to @entity65 early in his tenure and gave a much - watched speech to offer a " new era " in @entity27 relations with the @entity71 and @entity72 world			2
that was the high point			0
although it came into office hoping to seduce the region rather than fight it , the @entity61 administration has not delivered on the tantalizing promises it made since taking over , not only to show progress on solving the @entity80 - @entity79 conflict but to encourage democratic reform			0
change in the region comes not from his encouragement but from the disaffected taking matters into their own hands			0
these dashed expectations @entity61 has created in the region are not just disappointing ; they have hurt @entity27 credibility in the region and have had diplomats and @entity4 experts scratching their heads about just what @entity61 's vision for the region is			1
this troubled region has always looked to the @entity27 to help in times of crisis			2
now , countries like @entity33 and @entity102 , whose interests do n't always align with @entity0 's , are taking the lead			0
while its influence on big - ticket issues in the region is declining , the @entity27 has redoubled efforts to tackle their root causes , such as poverty , hunger and disenfranchisement of women			2
these are the same ills that prompted @entity117 to take to the streets , with people in the neighborhood nipping at their heels			0
sensing the winds of change in the region , the @entity61 administration has been engaged in a robust debate over the past few months about whether to elevate the issue of reform			0
the answer was delivered in a speech last month in @entity102 by secretary of state @entity129 , in which she warned @entity71 leaders that unless they reform and address economic and social frustrations , their regimes would " sink into the sand			0
" the fall of president @entity138 @entity137 in @entity117 and the events in @entity14 caught @entity27 officials off - guard and brought that debate to critical mass. for the first time in history , the @entity27 has broken with authoritarian @entity71 allies			1
the events in @entity14 have leaders of other pro- @entity27 countries in the region rightly concerned about what will happen if demonstrations take place in their countries and whether they can count on @entity27 's loyalty			1
the @entity61 administration is trying to send the message to these countries -- but not necessarily their leaders -- that they can count on @entity27 loyalty			2
for years , a game ensued in which the @entity27 called for reform and @entity71 leaders resorted to cosmetic and ad hoc changes to placate @entity0 , which accepted the meager gestures in the hopes they would lead to further changes			2
@entity61 's decision to break with @entity7 , a critical @entity27 ally in the @entity4 , serves as a warning to @entity71 allies that they too are expendable and their reactions to @entity27 calls for reform in the future must be met more seriously			1
although the @entity27 has finally found its footing on the reform issue , its aspirations of restarting @entity4 peace talks between @entity80 and @entity79 may be stalled indefinitely			1
@entity7 was an anchor of @entity27 policy of stability in the region			1
the twin pillars of that policy -- support for pro-american regimes that share @entity27 security interests and the pursuit of @entity80 - @entity71 peace -- are now on shaky ground			2
@entity80 will probably conclude that if such entrenched @entity71 regimes can fall , making peace with a deeply divided @entity79 movement is anything but a sure bet			0
@entity80 is keeping a wary eye on developments in @entity14 with fears that an @entity72 takeover there would end three decades of cooperation between the two countries			2
the @entity27 - brokered @entity200 accords , signed by @entity80 prime minister @entity201 and @entity14 president @entity202 in 1978 , ended a generation of hostilities between the two nations and forged a relationship that has endured , in part , because of the stability of the @entity7 regime -- which came to power after @entity202 was assassinated in 1981 -- and in spite of deep animus among rank - and - file @entity14 toward @entity80			1
@entity213 , @entity80 's ambassador to @entity14 from 2003 to 2005 , predicted that if the @entity7 regime falls , a new @entity215 regime , hostile to @entity80 and @entity217 nations , will replace it			1
" there will be no democracy in @entity14 , " @entity213 said			2
" if there will be democratic elections in @entity14 in the summer or in the very near future , ( they ) will be the first and last democratic elections in @entity14			2
" while he recognizes that the causes of the upheaval in @entity14 lie in economic and social strife , @entity80 president @entity224 said he is concerned that " there is a possibility that an organized force will take advantage of the situation			1
" a new @entity14 regime probably will affect relations with @entity235 , which controls the @entity79 territory sandwiched between @entity80 and @entity14 , and may play up the harsh criticism among many sectors in @entity14 society toward @entity80 policy			2
but some terrorism experts believe that extremist voices are being drowned out by the chants of the protesters in @entity65			0
@entity1 analyst @entity245 wrote that @entity56 's support base , " already severely shaken by its barbaric excesses in @entity248 and biting criticism from fellow jihadists , could narrow yet further			0
" " the televised scenes of secular , middle - class youngsters and @entity14 from all walks of life courageously and largely peacefully challenging the regime of president @entity7 have been transmitted onto tens of millions of television screens across the @entity71 world and have captured the imagination , providing vastly more attractive role models for young @entity71 , whose hopes for too long have been strangled by political , economic and cultural sclerosis , " he wrote			1
@entity27 officials feel that the @entity264 , @entity14 's main @entity72 political organization , has been very sophisticated in its handling of the people 's revolt			1
the group deliberately stayed out of the fray in the early days of the protests , allowing other @entity14 to lead the charge for fear @entity7 would cite fears of extremist activity in cracking down on the demonstrators			1
@entity276 , an associate professor of political science at @entity278 and author of " @entity280 : @entity283 in @entity14 , " notes that the @entity264 is an umbrella organization that encompasses different views and trends			2
though technically illegal , the group does have a presence among the masses , but it is no longer the defiant anti-system movement it was in the past			0
the key question is whether the @entity264 will continue to exercise self - restraint when the @entity7 regime falls			2
@entity293 believes it will , arguing that the @entity264 is less interested in seizing power and calling the shots than it is in spreading its message and influencing policy			0
other experts believe the @entity264 will grab power if given the chance			0
it is unclear to what extent established institutions of @entity14 and other countries will be willing and able to change and open enough political space for viable oppositions to flourish			0
the future of @entity27 policy and interests in the region will largely depend on who ends up in power , not just in @entity14 but in the host of other countries on the verge of transformation			1
in a doomsday scenario , extremist @entity72 factions in @entity14 , @entity117 and even @entity321 could come to power , killing critical diplomatic and military relationships , forcing the closing of the @entity326 and allowing @entity30 fill the vacuum			1
that could even trigger a most dangerous war between @entity80 and @entity30			0
nobody expects that worst - case nightmare to come through , however			0
regardless of the outcome , the @entity61 administration has concluded that it must try to be on the right side of history , which is seems to be the catchphrase of the week for @entity4 analysts			0
supporting the status quo could embolden leaders to hold on , possibly becoming even more oppressive			0
that could give way to a permanent resistance that creates even more pressure for chance , further radicalizes the @entity71 street and creates even more anger at the @entity27			0
this tectonic shifts taking place in the region have altered the @entity27 role in the @entity4 indefinitely , if not forever			1
for the first time in decades , the @entity27 is in uncharted waters in the proverbial boat without a paddle			0
there is certain fatalism to it all , with the @entity27 gradually accepting the hard reality that it can only be driven by events rather than helping to drive them			0
the hope is that the whoever the new leaders of the @entity4 are , they will look to @entity0 as a partner			0
when asked how the @entity27 will pick up the pieces in the region , one senior official simply said , " we will call whoever is in charge			0

nobody is sure who will fill @entity7 's place when he steps down as @entity14 's president
the effects will be felt in the @entity4 and in the @entity27
