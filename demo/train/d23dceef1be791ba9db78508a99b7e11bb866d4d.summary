@entity0 , @entity1 -- prosecutors fighting to keep @entity5 student @entity4 behind bars for murder in @entity1 defended on monday the dna tests that linked her to the killing of @entity13 student @entity11			1
@entity14 is appealing her conviction and 26 - year sentence for the murder of her housemate in 2007 , with her defense team arguing that dna evidence used in her original trial is not conclusive			1
this summer two new forensic experts , professors @entity24 and @entity26 , cast doubt on the dna evidence that played a role in the convictions of @entity14 and ex-boyfriend @entity30			1
" i think the prosecution is trying to take the independent experts ' testimony away and frankly , i do n't see that happening , " @entity14 's father , @entity31 , told reporters after court adjourned monday			2
" i mean , i think the independent experts have done a very good job in evaluating the information ... and i do n't see it breaking down at this point			2
i see that it has been good for @entity4			2
" @entity44 , the @entity1 state police forensic expert who conducted the initial dna examination presented at @entity14 's trial , testified monday regarding the methods and equipment she used			1
@entity44 told prosecutor @entity49 she was using older equipment at the time			0
while police now have better equipment that can analyze smaller amounts of @entity45 , she said the testing methods remain the same			1
authorities testified in 2009 that a knife found in @entity30 's home had traces of @entity14 's genetic material on the handle and @entity61 's in a tiny groove on the blade			1
dna on @entity61 's bra was also traced to @entity30			2
@entity24 testified that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of @entity45 said to be @entity61 's was so low , it could not be examined again with any conclusions			1
@entity24 and @entity26 also said there was no evidence the knife had been " thoroughly washed , " as prosecutors argued during the trial			0
@entity44 said according to the protocol she used , the amount of @entity45 on the knife was sufficient and clearly attributable to @entity61			1
she said the new experts have equipment capable of examining very small dna samples and that testing should have been done			0
" @entity44 has thoroughly and calmly clarified the principal elements of the work she carried out -- in a clear manner , given the complex subject ... during the examination at the time , " @entity82 , attorney for the @entity61 family , said monday			1
" i think she managed to get the court 's full attention and to have damaged the independent forensic work			2
" @entity24 and @entity26 also said the clasp from @entity61 's bloodied bra , which allegedly contained @entity30 's dna , was " dirty " and had been allowed to rust , making further testing futile			2
the evidence , the two argued , should be " inadmissible			0
" @entity44 is expected to testify about the bra clasp tuesday			0
she testified monday that she wore anti-contamination equipment when examining the dna evidence			0
" the appeals trial is very different from the first trial , obviously , " @entity14 said monday			2
" and i see that , especially with the appeals trial asking for an independent review ... with the way the information came back from the independent experts , i see that this is turning ( in ) @entity30 and @entity4 's direction			1
" asked about his daughter , he said , " i got to hug her for a few seconds			0
she is happy that court is back in session again			0
it has been a long summer for her , knowing that she is innocent			0
... she is anxious , she is hopeful and she is looking forward to a decision hopefully by the end of this month			1
" as the appeal heads into its final weeks , @entity61 's sister on sunday urged people not to get caught up in the details but to " please remember our beautiful @entity11			1
" " amongst the media frenzy that has developed throughout , @entity11 has been forgotten because she is no longer with us , yet this should be about her and what really happened on that tragic evening , " @entity61 said in a statement distributed by @entity82 , the family attorney			1
@entity14 and @entity30 were convicted in 2009 of killing @entity61 , 21			1
@entity30 was sentenced to 25 years in prison			2
a third defendant , small - time drug dealer @entity11 , an immigrant from the @entity135 , was also jailed in connection with @entity61 's death			1
he was sentenced to 30 years for murder and sexual violence following a fast - track trial in 2008 , but his sentence was later cut to 16 years			2
@entity61 , a @entity13 exchange student , was found dead , seminaked and her throat slashed in the villa she and @entity14 rented in the central @entity1 university town of @entity0			1
the two professors have said records about the machine that did the dna testing were missing , suggesting the testing process itself may have been unreliable			0
on monday , prosecutor @entity49 said the records had been found and asked the judge to admit them as evidence			0
the defense argued they should not be admitted because they were not in the files originally given to the new experts			0
@entity49 said @entity24 and @entity26 could have had them if they had asked for them			0
forensic experts for the two sides are expected to return to the stand tuesday			0
this stage of the appeal is scheduled to run at least through saturday			0
final arguments and summations are expected this month			0
@entity170 's sister @entity61 said the family was feeling " great concern as the rumours surrounding the original dna evidence findings are spreading			1
" she said it was difficult for @entity61 's family to understand how the evidence , so carefully developed and presented at trial , could be deemed irrelevant , and also to understand how a small amount could be useless when there is no determination of how much should be present			2
@entity14 's defense seems " to focus and rely heavily on these two pieces of dna evidence , but can we just remember for a moment what this case is actually about : my sister , a daughter brutally and selfishly taken from us nearing four years ago ... not a single day goes by that we can grasp any peace or closure			1
" she urged the public to remember the blood - splattered crime scene as well as 10,000 pages of evidence presented in the case			0
" we still have confidence in the @entity0 police and every faith in all those involved in court and the investigation , " @entity61 said			2
her family is asking that the appeals court assess each piece of evidence , " both scientific and circumstantial , as well as any witnesses who have taken the stand independently of any other information or media			0
" @entity82 said monday that @entity61 's family has faith " in the whole baggage of evidence " aside from evaluation of the @entity45 on the knife and bra clasp			1
" please do not let @entity11 die in vain , " @entity61 said			1
" her courage and strength fight on and we will seek justice so she can rest in peace			0
" her sister , she said , put up a fight for her life and did not give up , " and we will not give up now			0
" @entity2 's @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
