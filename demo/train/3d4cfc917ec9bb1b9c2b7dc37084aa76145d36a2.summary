-- shrimp : it 's not just for surf - and - turf anymore			1
in fact , thanks to research at @entity7 , the little crustaceans may be the next thing in plastic			1
in experiments with the material in shrimp shells , called chitosan , and material from silk , known as fibroin , researchers at @entity7 's @entity12 put the two together at a nano level			1
the result was a material they call " shrilk " -- a substance that 's both remarkably malleable and incredibly sturdy			1
" it actually feels like a huge beetle shell , or cuticle , " says @entity25 , the director of the @entity12			0
" ( it ) can be very strong in terms of tensile strength			0
if you wet them they can actually get more flexible , " he adds			1
" we can get the range of different properties of plastics by changing how we fabricate these			0
" though the word " plastic " applies to any moldable solid , it 's come to be associated with materials made out of petrochemicals			1
that 's both a blessing and a curse			0
plastics are made in such quantity that they 're both inexpensive and versatile , yet most are n't biodegradable			1
indeed , the infamous @entity51 trash vortex -- the large area of garbage suspended in the @entity51 -- is primarily made up of plastic debris , which has killed fish and wildlife and wreaked havoc on local ecosystems			1
@entity60 , on the other hand , is fully biodegradable , says @entity25 -- a necessity if the product is to succeed			2
" in the middle of the @entity65 and @entity51 there 's continents of plastic floating that fish are getting entangled in and dying			2
we ca n't keep going on like this , " he says			0
" i think many people are searching for replacements for plastics that would have the properties of plastic but be fully biodegradable			1
this may not solve all the problems but we feel like it 's a first step			0
" the current challenge for shrilk is to make it cost - effective			1
there 's plenty of raw material , says @entity25 -- the seafood industry has so much shrimp shell discard " that they have to pay to get it cleared away sometimes " -- but there 's still a ways to go			2
" we need to work with real manufacturers who know what the design challenges are and the durability and the cost , " says @entity25			0
" the materials exist , the manufacturing processes exist , it really just requires it to be integrated into the pipeline			0
" the researchers say there is plenty of room for growth			2
literally , in fact : the material in shrilk makes excellent fertilizer			2
" they are so rich in nutrients that you could put seeds in them , just in the broken down material , and a plant will grow , " says @entity25			0
perhaps , a new part of the plastics industry will as well .			0

@entity7 researchers have developed plastic made of shrimp shells , silk
so - called " shrilk " can be hard or flexible
substance is also biodegradable
