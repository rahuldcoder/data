@entity0 -- @entity3 officials warn the threat posed by a lone gunman or a group with small arms is a serious concern to law enforcement			2
a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the @entity11 and the @entity12 cites the july attack in @entity14 as one very deadly example			1
@entity16 allegedly shot and killed 69 people on the @entity14 island of @entity19			1
authorities say earlier that day a vehicle bomb made by @entity16 exploded in @entity22 and killed eight people			2
the @entity3 law enforcement bulletin issued tuesday warns @entity16 's preparations went undetected			1
the memo , which was obtained by @entity1 , says @entity16 " is believed to have acted alone and used legal methods to procure the vast majority of materials and weapons needed for his operation , successfully avoiding law enforcement suspicion			2
" in an interview with @entity1 's @entity36 on tuesday , president @entity34 expressed concerned about lone wolf actors " being able to carry out wide - scale massacres of the sort that we saw in @entity14			1
" he called the lone wolf worry " the most likely scenario that we have to guard against right now			1
" a law enforcement official told @entity1 the alert sent to state and local law enforcement was a " cautionary kind of thing " and was not the result of intelligence concerning a possible upcoming attack			1
the official noted the upcoming 10th anniversary of the september 11 terror attacks , but quickly added law enforcement is always worried about catching lone actors before they strike			2
the document lays out the singular challenge for law enforcement presented by lone wolves : " attacks by lone offenders -- which by definition lack co-conspirators , and therefore provide fewer opportunities for detection -- may be more difficult for law enforcement and homeland security authorities to disrupt			0
" @entity71 chief @entity70 says the lone wolf scenario remains a concern , and intelligence is the " best tool " to prevent it			0
" there are a number of trip wires in place around the country that the @entity12 and others have , state and local police			0
those are the best opportunities to detect and deter a possible terrorist			0
that being said there are those individuals -- lone wolves that i referred to -- that do things on their own , " @entity70 told @entity1			0
speaking before the @entity3 @entity91 at a " @entity94 , @entity95 " public awareness event on wednesday , @entity11 secretary @entity93 said , " we 're seeing smaller plots using a variety of techniques ... we 're also seeing the rise of activities by individuals who are actually in the country			1
and they 're acting by themselves			0
and that kind of attack is the most difficult to prevent			1
" however , the @entity3 has had success detecting lone wolf plots			0
the bulletin points to the july 27 arrest of an awol soldier named @entity113 who allegedly wanted to attack soldiers at gathering spots near @entity116 in @entity117			1
the document says law enforcement found bomb - making materials in @entity113 's hotel room but law enforcement was alerted in time to avert an attack thanks to a warning from a gun store employee who found @entity113 's behavior suspicious			1
but another plot involving @entity116 was not detected , which resulted in tragic consequences			1
in november 2009 , @entity132 maj. @entity131 allegedly opened fire in a center where soldiers were preparing to deploy overseas			0
armed with two pistols , @entity131 allegedly killed 13 people and wounded more than 30 others			0
the bulletin also warns terrorist groups overseas " have long favored small unit assault tactics , in which small teams of operatives storm a target using small arms to defeat security			2
" @entity3 officials say they have found " no information indicating transnation terrorists have attempted to execute a small - unit assault operation in the homeland			0
" but the document lists two homegrown plots that were disrupted			0
one involved six people found guilty of plotting to attack a military base at @entity156 , @entity157			2
a second one listed by @entity11 and @entity12 officials concerns two men who allegedly wanted to strike at a @entity161 in @entity162			1
@entity1 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			0
