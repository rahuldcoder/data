-- when @entity2 exploded onto the scene , enthusiasts could barely contain their excitement over pages upon pages of pastel , lace - trimmed , sugar - sprinkled @entity9 deliciousness			1
it was the manifestation of our collective consciousness of intended crafts			2
we spent hours pinning , as if the action itself were a legitimate replacement for actual creation			2
who does n't want to know how to make @entity20 - infused vodka ( " vomit the rainbow " ) or create an anytime jersey dress out of an oversized t - shirt ? again , we were n't exactly creating most of these items , but knowing they were safely tucked away within meticulously organized virtual boards was enough to make us feel like creative maestros			2
for parents , @entity2 took things to a whole ... ' nother ... level			1
one could pass days falling down the rabbit hole of ideas spanning every milestone of child rearing			2
from the time - lapse pregnancy photo montage to gender - reveal cupcakes to lunchbox hand - pies shaped like baby octopi , @entity2 left no familial event untouched			1
suddenly , a rumbling in the distance			2
an overwhelming tide began to rise			2
it 's not that these ideas were overly complicated			1
there were just so many of them			2
all demanding attention , crying out for a voyage to the craft store , begging to be manifested into fruition			2
what 's wrong with using tech to distract kids ? initially , i 'd managed to stay on the shore and watch @entity59 sink or swim from a distance			1
@entity2 did n't infect me during any of the traditional gateway holidays like @entity62 or @entity63 ( did you know both of these holidays now require wreaths ? )			1
it got me with the @entity68			1
when i was kid , the @entity68 , if the wench remembered to come all , would leave a quarter			1
maybe 50 cents if she was having a good year			2
a 2012 survey reported that @entity75 parents give their children $ 3 per tooth , so even considering 20 years of inflation , my fairy was obviously from the wrong side of the tracks			2
when i was a child , my mom was studying to become a dentist			2
maybe to her , the idea of celebrating calcified structures separating from mouth tissue seemed like overkill			0
these days , a quick " @entity68 " search on @entity2 will result in thousands of ways to turn what should be a very simple transaction into an event worthy of a @entity92 score			1
i 'm not sure what it is about this specific milestone that had me feeling all romantic , but i knew @entity2 would be the place to go for inspiration			1
by the time my oldest daughter 's first tooth was threatening to wriggle free , i 'd hyped up the @entity68 significantly			1
" what do you think she 'll bring ? i hope it 's not money			1
i do n't like money , " she said as i pulled her comforter to her chin			0
" me too ? " my 3 - year - old worriedly asked from her bed across the room			1
" i 'm not sure what she 's going to bring			1
and she never forgets little sisters , " i explained			0
eventually , the tooth fell out during breakfast			0
unfortunately , as the day went on , the business of life combined with my chronic tendency to procrastinate proved more powerful than the @entity2 - derived @entity68 extravaganza i 'd planned			1
i did n't remember the fairy 's scheduled visit until i woke up with a massive start at 2 a.m. the next day			1
i 'd dropped the ball			0
my mind started to race with ideas			0
perhaps the gas station around the corner had candy ... wait no , the @entity68 would n't give candy ; that 'd be like a doctor handing out @entity133			1
and do i really want to get on the road at 2 a.m. when the bars are closing ? what if there are drunken drivers ? i do n't want to go down as the first @entity2 - related death			1
i began opening every closet in my home , searching the pantry for something that i could pass off as a gift from an enchanted forest warehouse			0
i found a few mini candy canes , but no , the tooth fairy would clearly be non-denominational			0
maybe i could make sandwiches shaped like hearts and keep them in the fridge -- no , the present is supposed to be under their pillow			0
shaved turkey slices on whole wheat have no place in a child 's bedding ; even i know that			1
i finally found some snack mix that i was sure my kids had n't seen before			1
combined with a few chocolate chips ... that 's something the @entity68 would whip together in her @entity166 kitchen , right ? as i prepared the melange and dumped it into sandwich bags , i got a distinct mental picture of a jury of @entity2 moms in cardigans shaking their heads at me while knitting stuffed animals			1
" groceries ? really ? " their leader said			0
she was wearing a t - shirt dress			0
it looked amazing on her			0
i glanced down sheepishly at my work			0
the bags looked like something you 'd sneak into a movie theater to save $ 5			0
i closed the bags with craft twine and finished the whole debacle with wrapping paper			0
what about a note ? there are hundreds of pins featuring little notes written with what i can only assume are calligraphy pens			0
people even make matching miniature envelopes			0
after i 'd dropped the packages , being careful not to wake the children ( how would that go ? " oh i was just seeing the @entity68 out ... " ) , i still felt uneasy			1
you 're only a kid once			0
it 's fun to believe in this nonsense			2
i decided to take it up a notch by sprinkling some pink glitter by their bedsides and made a trail all the way to the upstairs bathroom window			1
no , i had n't been drinking or using recreational drugs			0
it just felt right at the time			0
by now , i was so tired that i was having a semi-out - of - body experience and felt like i really was the @entity68			1
glitter clean - up ? i 'd have one of the lesser fairies take care of it the next day			2
it will be good for their @entity226 © @entity225 © s. about 3 a.m. , i remembered seeing a website where you can superimpose pictures of a fairy on a photo of your sleeping child			0
knowing that nothing would traumatize my youngest daughter more than a visual of an otherworldly creature walking on her face while she lay unconscious , i took a photo of a windowsill upstairs instead			0
for the low price of $ 7 , i added what looked like a crouching @entity245 doll wearing a cheap prom dress and wings			0
as i lay in bed , i created an elaborate backstory of how i 'd managed to take the photo with my @entity251 right before she spit in my face for scaring her			1
come morning , the children were as excited as could be to find their plastic food bags beside their beds			0
" there is fairy dust everywhere ! " they shouted from upstairs			0
the photo was the icing on the cake			0
i 'm still trying to decide what the @entity68 will bring the next time she pays a visit			1
maybe a gift card .			0

@entity269 's @entity268 says @entity2 has created *unrealistic* *expectations*
she managed to avoid the holiday @entity2 craze but *succumbed* with the @entity68
in a blast of creativity , @entity268 decorated her kids ' room with snacks and glitter
she says the kids ' *reaction* made the effort *worthwhile* but set a high bar
