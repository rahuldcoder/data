-- president @entity1 said friday he came to @entity2 to break down stereotypes between the @entity4 and its neighbor to the south			1
speaking at the @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity1 said that too often the relationship between the @entity4 and @entity2 is " trapped in old stereotypes , " where @entity2 see @entity11 as trying to wall itself off from @entity2 and @entity4 see @entity2 through the sensational headlines of violence in the war on drugs			1
" i have come to @entity2 because it is time to put old mindsets aside , " @entity1 said			2
" it 's time to recognize new realities , including the impressive progress in today 's @entity2			0
" he said it is clear that " a new @entity2 is emerging , " highlighted by a growing economy , a robust democracy and new generation of youth empowered by technology			0
" i see a @entity2 that is taking its rightful place in the world , " he said			1
in a tip of the hat to the overwhelming number of @entity34 that helped re-elect @entity1 in 2012 , the president said , " without the strong support of @entity34 , including so many @entity36 , i would not be standing before you today as president of the @entity4			1
" throughout much of @entity1 's only speech in the country , the president framed two domestic issues in the @entity4 -- guns and immigration -- as issues that affect the daily lives of @entity2 , too			1
on immigration , the president appeared confident that immigration reform , an issue @entity1 says he intends to work closely with the @entity2 government on , will be passed			1
" i 'm optimistic that -- after years of trying -- we are finally going to get it done this year , " @entity1 said after describing his plan as one that strengthens border security , improves legal immigration and " gives millions of undocumented individuals a pathway to earn their citizenship			0
" and on guns , @entity1 framed the issue , one the president made a priority after 20 students and six adults were killed at a school shooting in @entity68 , @entity69 , as something that would save both @entity11 and @entity2 lives			1
" we also recognize that most of the guns used to commit violence here in @entity2 come from the @entity4 , " the president said			1
" i will continue to do everything in my power to pass common sense reforms that keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people , that can save lives here in @entity2 and back home in the @entity4			2
" in interviews before the speech , however , most students in the crowd did not mention guns or immigration as issues they hoped the president would discuss			0
flanked by @entity11 and @entity2 flags , students from @entity91 in @entity8 put the war on drugs , @entity95 and education as higher priorities for them than either immigration reform or guns			0
" i hope to hear about his education plans in the @entity4 , because college is expensive and i 'm hoping to study there , " said @entity99 , an 18 - year - old senior			0
@entity1 did mention education , telling the students that the @entity4 and @entity2 need to " do more together in education so our young people have the knowledge and skills to succeed			1
" the president also announced plans to encourage 100,000 students from the @entity4 to study in @entity11 , including @entity2 , each year , and for the same number of @entity11 students to come to the @entity4			2
although many of the students live in @entity8 , an area that has witnessed far fewer incidents of drug - related violence than the north , the war on drugs was not far from most students ' minds			0
" the biggest thing i want to see is how the @entity4 and @entity2 are willing to tackle the war on drugs , " said @entity125 , another 18 - year - old senior			1
" in my point of view , it has not been successful			0
" on thursday , at a news conference with @entity2 president @entity130 , @entity1 stressed the focus of his trip is the economy , not security and immigration , two issues @entity1 said often get too much attention when it comes to talking about the @entity4 - @entity2 relationship			1
" we do n't want to make this relationship targeted on one single issue , " @entity1 said			0
" we want to place particular emphasis on the potential in the economic relationship between @entity2 and the @entity4			1
" but even as @entity1 and @entity130 pushed to shift the tone more toward trade and economics , security issues loomed large over thursday 's meeting			0
@entity130 said thursday that his government remains committed to fighting organized crime , but the @entity4 and @entity2 must " cooperate on the basis of mutual respect , to be more efficient in our security strategy that we are implementing in @entity2			1
" @entity1 stressed that the countries will continue to cooperate closely on security , but he did n't specify how			0
" i agreed to continue our close cooperation on security , even as that nature of that close cooperation will evolve , " he said			0
it 's up to the @entity2 people , @entity1 said , " to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations , including the @entity4			1
" high - profile cartel takedowns were a hallmark of former president @entity169 's tenure			2
@entity130 has vowed to take a different approach , focusing more on education problems and social inequality that he says fuel drug violence			0
the details of his policies are still coming into focus , and analysts say his government has deliberately tried to shift drug violence out of the spotlight			0
before @entity1 's arrival , a spate of news reports this week on both sides of the border detailed changes in how @entity2 cooperates with the @entity4			1
under the new rules , all @entity4 requests for collaboration with @entity2 agencies will flow through a single office , interior minister @entity186 told @entity2 's state - run @entity193 news agency			2
it is a drastic change from recent years , when @entity4 agents enjoyed widespread access to their @entity2 counterparts			2
critics have expressed concerns that @entity130 's government will turn a blind eye to cartels or negotiate with them -- something he repeatedly denied on the campaign trail last year			0
on tuesday -- two days before @entity1 's arrival -- his government arrested the father - in - law of @entity211 " @entity206 , head of @entity2 's @entity207 and one of the country 's most - wanted drug lords			2
but with the focus on the economy , @entity130 said the presidents agreed to create a new high - level group to discuss economic and trade relations between the two nations			1
the group , which will include cabinet ministers from both countries and vice president @entity222 , will have its first meeting this fall , the @entity2 president said			2
imports and exports between the @entity4 and @entity2 totaled nearly $ 500 billion last year , and before @entity1 's arrival officials on both sides of the border said economic relations would be a focal point during the @entity4 president 's visit			1
later , he traveled to @entity233 , where he met with president @entity234 and other regional leaders			1
@entity1 pledged continued @entity4 support to the @entity238 , saying " with the absence of security , " it is very hard to develop economically			2
" problems like narco - trafficking arise when a country is vulnerable because of poverty and institutions not working for people , " he said			0
" the stronger the economy and institutions for individuals seeking legitimate careers , the less powerful these narco - trafficking operations are going to be			0
" @entity0 's @entity251 and @entity252 and @entity0 en @entity253 's @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report .			0

new : president @entity1 meets with @entity233 president @entity234 , regional leaders
" i see a @entity2 that is taking its rightful place in the world , " @entity1 says
the @entity4 remains committed to reducing the demand for drugs , he says
a new high - level group to discuss economic cooperation will *convene* in the fall
