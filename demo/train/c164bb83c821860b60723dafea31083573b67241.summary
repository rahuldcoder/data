-- let 's face it ; most awards shows can be pretty dull			1
it 's not that we do n't tune in to every single one , of course , but it 's always a pleasant surprise when the ceremony is actually fun to watch			1
last night 's @entity9 hosted by @entity10 not only honored emmy shoo - ins like " @entity12 , " " @entity13 " and " @entity14 " and fan favorite " @entity16 " alike , but also brought the laughs			1
here are our top five funniest moments			1
leading ladies storm the stage as soon as @entity21 and @entity22 presented the nominees for outstanding lead actress in a comedy , @entity26 , whose name was read first for " @entity28 ' " smiled at the camera and then promptly ran up onto the stage before any of the other nominees -- let alone the winner -- was announced			1
as @entity21 and @entity22 continued to read names , each of @entity26 's fellow funny women , @entity37 ( " @entity46 " ) , @entity38 ( " @entity39 " ) , @entity40 ( " @entity41 " ) , @entity42 ( " @entity43 " ) and @entity44 ( " @entity47 " ) joined her on stage			1
the group lined up and held hands in their best beauty pageant re-enactment while waiting for the big reveal -- a bit which received a standing ovation from the audience			2
to top off an already stellar and hilarious display of female solidarity , when @entity37 won the @entity9 she not only received genuine smiles and big hugs from the rest of the women , but also walked away with a bouquet of roses and a tiara as a bonus			2
" wow , it 's my first and best pageant ever ! " @entity37 said			2
all - star ' office ' back from commercial break , viewers were treated to a sketch where characters from different shows all popped up at the @entity74 office to discuss their least favorite thing about their jobs			1
there was @entity83 from " @entity28 , " @entity81 from " @entity43 , " @entity77 from " @entity13 " and @entity78 from " @entity79 " ( who we learn is @entity85 's crystal meth dealer ) and more			2
@entity86 showed up , but even she was a little confused as to why			2
" i 'm sorry , i 'm not sure i get the question , " she deadpanned			2
" what do you mean by work ? am i saying that word right ? work ? " finally , we see @entity93 in @entity95 's old office , but the rest of the staff is sure this is a mistake			1
" i 'm pretty sure that i 'm taking over as the new lead , " @entity93 said			0
when @entity99 tells him that 's for a different show and this is n't @entity104 lot , it all clicks for @entity93			0
" oh , i was wondering where the half man was ! " 3			0
@entity10 's shortest , sweetest zinger " a lot of people are curious why i 'm a lesbian			0
ladies and gentleman ... the cast of @entity115			0
@entity117 's wife when @entity117 and @entity119 of " @entity14 " won for outstanding writing in a comedy series , it was a safe bet that the speech would be funny			0
but viewers were n't expecting @entity117 's wife @entity125 's perfect , comedic timing to steal the show			0
when @entity117 explained that the inspiration for the winning episode was when his children walked in on him and his wife " in the act , " @entity125 looked directly at the camera and rolled her eyes			1
later in the speech when @entity117 went back to the mic to thank his " somewhat - satisfied wife , " she reprised the disgruntled eye roll and forever cemented a place in our hearts			0
remote @entity141 just when we thought all the joke mileage that could be gotten out of @entity141 ' @entity144 hosting controversy had run out ages ago , he once again faced some of the celebs he slammed -- albeit in an @entity9 pre-recorded message			1
" sorry i ca n't be there live in person , " he said			0
in fact , now during any awards ceremony , i 'm not even allowed on @entity155 soil			0
and the @entity9 bosses have warned me that if i say anything rude or controversial , they will edit it out and you wo n't know the difference			0
" he then began to deliver a speech full of obvious jump - cut edits when he veered into potentially dangerous territory , like when he said some shows that had beaten him out for @entity9 were , in his opinion , absolute ... " @entity165			1
" what were your favorite moments of the @entity169 ? tell us in the comments below .			0
