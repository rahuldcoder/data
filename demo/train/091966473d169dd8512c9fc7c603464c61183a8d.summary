-- i thought i could drink			2
i thought i could eat			2
i even thought i could sing			2
then , @entity2 ( cny ) 2013 happened			1
i did n't just lose my @entity2 cherry last year ; it was ripped out of me , the flesh devoured and the stone spat back in my face			1
i wanted to enjoy it			2
i wanted to fall in love and snuggle up and giggle childishly -- like all first times should be			2
instead i was shocked , slightly abashed and in just enough pain to hope i did n't have to do it again soon			0
@entity2 was , as far as i understood , an annual get together for families and loved ones to enjoy each other 's company			1
so when my then girlfriend ( now wife ) suggested we go to her hometown to meet her extended family for the first time , i agreed -- with all the bouncy enthusiasm of a puppy being led to the vet			1
i was happy simply to be going somewhere , simply to be included , blissful in my ignorance of the anguish that awaited			0
what unfolded was an education in consumption that nearly matched in three days what i learned in four years as a @entity32 university student			0
the @entity2 myth if you do a little research into @entity2 , you 'll be told it 's a two - week period during which everyone goes home to honor their ancestors , worship deities and partake in superstitions and dragon dances that hark back centuries			1
and @entity44 celebrate @entity45 by singing hymns , praising @entity47 and distributing wealth and good cheer to the needy			0
it may go on in some places , for a short while , but for the most part , in most families , it 's about drinking and eating far too much and trying not to disembowel each other over a @entity58 board			1
the real cny -- at least my version of it -- is a similarly non-traditional tradition that revolves around food , arguments and of course baijiu , the sickly , sticky distilled spirit with more kick than a startled mule			1
it is this 100 - proof ( 57 % @entity68 ) pungent , nasal - cavity - searing liquid that will forever tinge my memories of that first cny experience			1
@entity71 or @entity72 ? it started with a 15 - hour train ride from @entity75 to @entity76 -- because we wanted to " do it properly , like locals			1
" that 's 225 million locals to be precise -- the number of people who traveled by train during 2013 's cny			1
it involved quantities of baijiu that do n't make any sense to our numerically challenged brains			1
eleven billion liters were consumed in @entity91 in 2012 -- that 's one third of all spirits consumed worldwide -- and my new family seemed convinced they could help surpass that in 2013			1
the drinking of baijiu at cny is a ceremonial affair that goes like this : there will be one uncle at the table who quietly designates himself the " baijiu assassin " -- empty baijiu glasses and sober people are his prey			1
his mission , he has decided , is to ensure no one can stand up from the table without stumbling and giggling			0
his weapon of choice is the toast , which works like this : he will stand , proffer his glass of baijiu toward another member , say something auspicious about health and fortune for the coming year , and then drink			0
the irony of that act has not yet been grasped , it seems			0
in order to acknowledge and accept the toast , the toastee must also stand and drink			0
importantly , the toastee must drink the same quantity as the toaster			0
and if you 're a " yingguoren " ( @entity127 ) or other " laowai " ( foreigner ) introduced to the group for the first time , you 'll often be the subject of these toasts			1
body slams in fact , all 12 members of the group toasted me at least twice			0
and a " ganbei " and " ceremonial " slamming of the entire glass of baijiu accompanied each toast			0
at one point , one of my new " cousins , " whose body mass was at least twice mine , decided to pay the ultimate respect by toasting me with three consecutive tumblers full of the stuff			0
in the hazy aftermath of what followed , i can vaguely recall a karaoke den , in which i decided " @entity157 " by @entity155 would be a good choice			2
tip : @entity155 's " @entity157 " is never a good karaoke choice , even when you do n't have to sprint for the bathroom midway through			1
but i was no worse than one of my new cousins , who appeared to make the rookie mistake of confusing volume for tunefulness			0
@entity167 number one , he of the three - glasses toast , revealed exactly why he was so " respectful " at dinner as he proceeded to dispossess me of loose change in a game of liar 's dice			1
and so on , and so forth , until the next thing i saw was my future mother - in - law bursting into the hotel room to feed us congee , thankfully one of the world 's great hangover soothers			1
cracking morning after i was thankful to have survived the previous night , until i was told in an airily dismissive way to get washed and dressed for we were to have lunch soon , and the celebrations would begin all over again			2
the only way i could have felt worse is if a thousand firecrackers were going off just outside the window			0
those firecrackers , unleashed upon so many hungover skulls each cny to symbolically drive away evil spirits , were like audible nails being hammered into my ear canals			0
if there is a pairing more unfortunate than the year 's most alcoholic night followed by the loudest morning after , i 've not heard of it			2
the second day went much like the first , and the third day went much like the second			0
thankfully , 2014 is not going like 2013			0
with a bottle of red .			0

meeting a partner 's @entity2 family for the first time is an alcohol - *imbued* affair
@entity71 , a distilled spirit , is consumed in huge quantities over the *festive* period
celebrations involve much food , karaoke and sore heads
