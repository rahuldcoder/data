@entity0 , we are fortunate to have the right to speak our minds			2
filmmaker @entity5 did just that with his attack on the use of military snipers in warfare just before the release of the @entity6 - nominated and devastating war / anti-war movie " @entity7 , " directed by @entity9			1
@entity5 obviously has the same freedom of speech right that all @entity0 do			1
some of what he has publicly stated in the past is opinion , some is fact and some is absolutely ludicrous			2
in an apparent reference to @entity25 @entity24 , credited with 160 enemy kills -- the most in @entity28 history -- and the movie " @entity7 , " @entity5 commented on @entity30 that his " uncle was killed by a sniper " and that he was " taught that all snipers were cowards			1
" @entity5 explains snipers are ' cowards ' tweet to begin with , the reason @entity0 have the freedom of speech @entity5 was exercising is because brave men such as @entity24 and other active - duty personnel and military veterans have fought to protect this precious right			1
as far as the comment that " snipers are cowards , " that is beyond ludicrous and it is difficult to understand just how anybody could make such a comment			1
let 's look at some of the basic facts surrounding @entity24 's life as a @entity25 sniper			1
@entity24 either trained for war or was deployed in war zones for more than 300 days a year during his service in the @entity25 teams			1
@entity25 wives basically raise their children alone			2
the divorce rate for @entity25 is incredibly high			2
many of the guys have been married multiple times			2
the children grow up not really knowing their dads because the dads go on frequent and often back - to - back deployments to war zones			0
these guys seldom know when they are leaving or for how long			0
their work involves going in harm 's way and fighting an enemy that is determined to do whatever it can to take away our way of life			0
after returning home from a deployment , these guys immediately go back to work preparing for the next deployment			0
some are not so fortunate and are wounded or killed in the line of duty			0
a sniper , who operates behind enemy lines , has one of the most demanding and dangerous duties in the @entity91 community			2
snipers operating in @entity96 , @entity92 and a host of other countries often must crawl and make their way through treacherous urban or desert war - zone terrain for hours just to reach their position undetected , a position of over-watch , cover and concealment			2
once they are on site , they sometimes stay in their position for days on end waiting for follow - on orders			0
why ' @entity7 ' is a smash hit military snipers are not sociopaths , coldblooded killers			1
snipers believe in their hearts that when they neutralize , or " take out , " a threat that they are saving the lives of their teammates , other military personnel or other innocent people			2
their target hit lists typically include terrorists or people preparing to cause grave harm or death to the innocent			0
as i cite in my book " @entity127 , " lt. col. @entity124 uses the analogy of wolves , sheep and sheepdogs			0
@entity124 , in his book " on combat , " compares the average citizen as basically peaceful and nonthreatening -- like sheep			0
these are the majority of people and do not want to cause harm to others ; they wish to live peacefully			0
the terrorist -- the enemy , the " bad guy " -- strikes terror and threatens to harm and kill the innocent , like the wolf who threatens the sheep			0
fortunately , there are brave men and women who sacrifice much to protect those who wish to live day to day in peace			2
these protectors are the community sheepdogs			0
@entity24 was a champion sheepdog			1
every time @entity24 pulled back on his trigger and fired a shot that neutralized a " wolf , " he was saving countless lives and protecting the sheep			1
every wolf he put down was no longer capable of causing harm or death to the sheep , the innocents			0
i ask , how can anybody consider a sniper , a @entity25 sniper , to be a coward ? as much as i try to keep my mind open to all viewpoints -- from the far left to the far right -- i can only reach the conclusion that @entity5 has no idea what he is talking about			1
his unfounded comments could not be further from the truth			0
i am confident that if @entity5 had the courage to spend just one day in a war - zone " sniper hide , " waiting for the go signal to take out an enemy target his opinions on snipers and the military would change 180 degrees			1
i would go so far as to say if @entity5 would simply attend a one - day sniper - training course in the @entity28 , his opinion would drastically change			1
yes , of course , he has the right to say whatever he wishes , but when a guy like @entity5 has the pulpit and the attention of the media , he should have a moral obligation to speak only on topics in which he has some basic knowledge of the facts			1
@entity24 is an @entity28 war hero who has been credited and awarded for saving countless @entity28 and innocent lives			1
after what he did for our country , after all of his sacrifices , @entity24 decided to get out of the @entity25 and assist those brothers in arms who returned from overseas with post-traumatic stress disorder			1
how incredibly sad and ironic that in february 2013 , @entity24 was killed and shot in the back , police say , by a @entity207 suffering with @entity208 whom he was trying to help and mentor			1
@entity5 , tell me : how was @entity24 a coward ? how are snipers cowards ? when @entity24 was killed , he left his loving and devoted wife , @entity212 , behind			1
she feels that " @entity7 " did a good job at portraying the struggles that @entity24 endured as a @entity25 sniper as well as his roles as a husband and father			1
the movie illustrates the real - life story of heroism , patriotism and self - sacrifice of a remarkable @entity28 war hero			0
@entity225 , who portrayed @entity24 , told @entity226 that the role was " nothing short of life - changing			1
it 's just not about me or @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , or anybody else			0
... it 's a real human being			0
... so there 's a huge responsibility			0
but i saw it as an honor			0
... i felt like i lived with him for those six months in a very intimate way			0
... ( @entity240 ) e was the first voice i heard every morning and the last voice i heard going to bed			0
" @entity24 joins the elite ranks of other @entity28 sniper icons such as @entity246 , who was credited with 93 confirmed kills during the @entity248			1
@entity246 felt the same as @entity24 did when it came to taking out threats			2
he simply understood that he was protecting his fellow @entity207 and other innocent people			0
if there were not people like @entity24 and @entity246 protecting our freedoms , @entity5 , along with the rest of us , would live in a much more dangerous world			1
i remain deeply honored and humbled to be an @entity28 and to have been part of a community where heroes like @entity24 have served .			2

@entity263 : @entity5 called snipers cowards , but they protect his free speech
@entity24 , subject of " @entity7 , " made sacrifices to protect our freedoms , he says
@entity263 : if @entity5 had trained to be a sniper , he *'d* have a clue
