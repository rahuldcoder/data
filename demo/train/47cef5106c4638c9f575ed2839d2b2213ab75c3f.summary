@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 has joined the growing number of major economies that are back in black			0
@entity1 's prime minister @entity7 's $ 150 billion stimulus helps nation out of recession			1
@entity1 's economy grew 3.7 percent on an annualized basis from april to june this year , the first time the world 's second largest economy has seen positive growth in 15 months			1
the announcement of preliminary figures by @entity1 's @entity18 comes after @entity19 and @entity20 surprised economists last week by posting 0.3 percent growth for the second quarter of the year			1
the news that @entity1 has rebounded -- the hardest hit of the major economies because of its reliance on exports -- gives economists cautious optimism that the worst of the global recession is over			2
" the economy has seen a bottoming out of global demand , which has pushed out net exports ... especially in high tech industries and basic materials , such as chemical , steel and so on because of @entity43 demand , " said @entity32 , chief economist in @entity1 for @entity33			0
@entity1 's gdp grew just under 1 percent during the three - month period and trade increased 1.6 percent			2
the uptick marks the end of the worst recession in @entity1 since the end of @entity1 's gdp fell at a record pace during the january - march quarter , when gdp was 15.4 percent lower than the same time period last year			1
the @entity54 economy was buoyed by a historic Â¥ 15 trillion ( $ 150 billion ) stimulus package in may , which included unemployment benefits , aid to struggling companies , promotion of green industries and a variety of tax breaks			0
" there are many times in the past when tax breaks and fiscal stimulus were offered and failed , but this time around , it worked , " @entity32 said			0
economists expect gdp to continue modest growth through the rest of the year , especially with an expected rebound in global auto sales this quarter			0
but whether the recovery can continue into the new year after the stimulus package runs its course remains a question			0
" @entity1 's economy still is quite sensitive to global demand ... and for consumer demand to grow on a self - sustained basis still seems unlikely , " @entity32 said .			1
