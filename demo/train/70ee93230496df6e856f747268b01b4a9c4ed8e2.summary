-- twenty - five years ago , @entity1 discovered " one of @entity4 's loudest bands , " courtesy of documentarian @entity6 and his film , " @entity8			0
" @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 will perform @entity13 and @entity14 songs on tour			1
it was all parody -- @entity6 was director @entity6 , and cohorts @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 played the heavy - metal musicians in @entity13 -- but for a fictional band , @entity13 has had a long afterlife			1
the film gave birth to several catchphrases , including one -- " up to 11 " -- that 's made it into the @entity27			0
there are web sites devoted to the tap , including at least one , http://tap-albums.s5.com / , that offers a complete discography of the fictional band 's nonexistent albums			0
and @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 have never left their spandexed alter egos behind			1
the band reunited for a 1992 album , " @entity38 , " and again for a 2001 tour			0
for the latter , the opening act was another @entity43 - @entity11 collaboration , the @entity14 from @entity9 's film " @entity44			1
" now @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity9 are hitting the road again , but not as @entity13 or the @entity14			1
they 're playing ... themselves			2
" we 're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us , and only us , " says @entity11 in a phone interview discussing the trio 's " @entity53 " 30 - date acoustic tour , which kicks off friday in @entity51 , @entity52			1
" and because we do n't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we 're trying to dress it up as a treat , a rare treat , to see us as ourselves			1
" the group will be performing both @entity13 and @entity14 songs , though , @entity11 adds , " [ we 'll be ] doing these songs kind of in a different way because we 're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters			1
" have no fear , however , tap fans : a new album , " @entity67 , " is due out in june			0
@entity11 took some time out from tour preparations to talk about @entity13 's origins , the similarities between @entity13 and @entity72 , and how " @entity73 " became more closely identified with the @entity14 than the @entity74			1
the following is an edited version of that interview			0
@entity0 : it 's been 25 years since " this is @entity13 , " but it 's been much longer since @entity13 came together			1
do you remember what brought it about -- and who it 's based on ? @entity11 : you know , i would like to make a little book composed of all the bands that people have guessed @entity13 actually is -- there would be a lot of bands in there			1
and in fact it is about a lot of bands -- it 's never been about one band			0
when we did this , the @entity98 had already done [ the @entity102 parody ] the @entity103 , so there had been a piece that ... was a really specific spoof of a really specific band			2
that was something we did n't want to do -- that had been done			0
our notion was to ... sort of encapsulate everything we know about rock ' n ' roll -- and everything we found funny or amusing about bands -- into one band			0
so it was a process of smooshing all that stuff into this fictional band			0
@entity0 : are you familiar about this new movie called " @entity119 " ? [ the documentary , about a real heavy - metal band , has been compared to " @entity8			2
" ] @entity11 : i 've been reading about it and hearing about it a lot , but i have n't seen it			1
the last thing i 've seen along that line was " @entity131			0
" ... was that amazing			0
... i heard they had a therapist			0
but it was n't really a therapist -- it was a life coach			0
which is different -- and worse ( laughs )			0
it 's one thing to have somebody who 's a therapist , but ... did you ever see " @entity142 " ? the daytime series on @entity144 ? @entity0 : no. @entity11 : oh , four or five women in a house with two life coaches			2
oh my @entity149 , it was just shocking			0
well , " @entity131 " is in that vein			0
@entity0 : how do you guys go about writing songs ? the songs on the first album were wonderful pastiches of various heavy metal - type things			2
on the second album you had more styles and brought in guest musicians , including [ renowned session pianist ] @entity162 for " @entity163 " @entity11 : my @entity149 , yeah			1
@entity162 had actually come in , i think , to audition for the movie but could n't do the movie or something , but we 'd always dreamed to work with @entity162			0
how we write the songs -- ... every one is a different experience			2
in the case of @entity13 , it 's what seems like a funny idea sort of leads to a riff or some lyrics			2
in the case of the @entity14 , i think there was more -- at least the stuff @entity10 and i wrote together -- a sense these certain kinds of songs that became clichés in that era of folk music , and we sort of have to touch each of these bases			1
@entity0 : like " blood on the @entity191 , " a combination of coal mining and train song			0
@entity11 : yeah ! we saved you the time			2
... there were a lot of songs in that era that were kind of based loosely or less loosely on the @entity203 , so we wrote " @entity204 , " and then of course the great cliché of folk music is the rambler or wandering song , so we wrote " @entity211 did no @entity212 ' , " about a guy who just stayed home			2
@entity0 : since you 're going to be performing as you , are you worried that people will show up wondering where the costumes are , or perhaps yell out , " @entity218 , i want to hear @entity219 , " or " hey @entity221 , do @entity220 " ? @entity11 : each seat will be [ affixed ] with @entity224 equipment to discourage that			1
... hopefully , we 'll be so entrancing that they wo n't be even thinking of talking to us , except if we ask for questions			0
but as to what people are expecting , we 're trying very hard to get across the idea that this is us , and only us , and because we do n't often appear as ourselves -- because we most often appear as characters -- we 're trying to dress it up as a treat , a rare treat , to see us as ourselves and doing these songs kind of in a different way , because we 're approaching them as ourselves and not as these characters			1
@entity0 : are you planning to do covers on the order of " @entity73 " ? [ the @entity14 covered the @entity74 song on the " @entity44 " soundtrack			1
] @entity11 : " @entity73 " is actually the only song that we did n't write that 's in the show			1
i ca n't resist [ it ] -- none of us can -- but i have a personal affection for it			2
after the @entity253 a few years ago in @entity254 , where the @entity74 played halftime , a few weeks later i met somebody who said that " the soundtrack record of ' @entity44 ' is my 6 - year - old son 's favorite cd , and at the @entity253 that day during halftime , i was in the kitchen making lunch for him and his sister , and the 6 - year - old ran into the kitchen as excited as i 'd ever seen him in his life and said , ' daddy daddy daddy , they 're doing a @entity14 song on the @entity253 ! ' "			1

@entity11 , @entity9 and @entity10 performing as themselves
trio has been @entity13 , the @entity14 in different movies
@entity11 : " we 're approaching [ songs ] as ourselves and not as these characters "
