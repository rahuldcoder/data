@entity0 , @entity1 -- for me , music is about joy -- the complete release of emotion , exhilaration and all - encompassing freedom			2
it 's so easy for us , especially as classical musicians who lock ourselves away from the world for hours at a time to perfect our craft , to forget that this music is really about others			2
it 's about conveying a message			0
for me , music is about communication that goes beyond our spoken language and rests deeper in our collective human psyche			2
in college , i fell in love with biology , especially neurobiology			0
i was even lucky enough to land a few internships at amazing labs -- one at @entity30 in @entity31 studying spinal chord regeneration and another at @entity33 studying @entity34			0
i was fascinated by the brain , and i wanted to become a doctor			0
but my heart cried out for music			2
and on a total whim ( more like a last chance , really ) , i took an audition for the @entity42 a few years later , and i won the job			1
learn more about @entity44 at @entity45 i was totally and utterly crazy about making music , but i confronted myself a few months into the job			1
what solid proof did i have , besides the ovations i received , that this music was affecting my audiences the way it affected me ? was i just playing the fiddle because it was something i did well and because i was , well , in love ? i felt like i was neglecting a calling as a doctor and a neuroscientist			2
and then i met @entity58			1
and i saw a miraculous transformation in a man who was delusional , lost and paranoid			0
i had witnessed ( and conducted ) a therapy where the dosage was n't measured or administered under sedation or struggle , where the treatment opened a channel for human communication and understanding			0
music communicated where words had failed ; i found a moment in which music transcended medicine			1
it caused a change , immediate and visceral , in a man who was on the brink of a schizophrenic episode			0
the music ultimately revealed @entity58 's brilliance -- as if the music opened the floodgates of a previous life and allowed him to face memories and emotions that may have been either too painful or distant to remember			1
@entity58 began to recite @entity86 opuses and @entity88 and @entity89 catalog numbers			1
he displayed an intuitive understanding of the violin though he 'd never taken a real lesson on in his life			1
he seemed happy and calm			0
he was a totally different person than when he had walked into the room			0
and the way that @entity58 changed also changed me , as a classical musician , as a voice for mental illness and as a human being			1
i realized that what really mattered here was n't the venue or even the type of music or any other type of external factor , but relation			0
the music equalized @entity58 and myself			1
it allowed us to behold each other at our most human level and relate to each other			0
the music allowed us to communicate at a profoundly honest level , and i understood that this was why i made music			1
to relate to people at their level through the expression of common , simple human emotion manifested as redemption			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity44 .			1

@entity44 gave up a career in medicine to play violin for the @entity42
he says *homeless* street musician @entity58 asked for a violin lesson with him
through music , @entity44 says , the two men were able to communicate and help heal @entity133
@entity44 says music has a *powerful* *ability* to connect people and treat mental illness
