-- @entity1 looks at the camera proudly			2
" in my mouth , i got stitches			2
in my legs , i got stitches too , " he announces			2
@entity1 is one of the subjects featured in " @entity9 , " a five - minute digital documentary by @entity12 filmmaker @entity11 about a subculture of train surfers in @entity15 -- one of @entity18 's largest and poorest townships ( " staff riding " is the local slang for train surfing )			1
the illegal " sport " attracts many of the community 's young men , who perform tricks and dance moves on top of moving trains			1
casino notes that the trains , which deliver many of the township 's workers and students into nearby @entity34 , plays a pivotal role in the region			1
" people from the township use the train every day			1
there 's a really strong connection here to the trains , and i think train surfing is something that came out of that relationship , " he says			1
the dangers are numerous for those that practice the activity			1
train speeds aside , these young daredevils have to constantly dodge 3,000 - volt cables overhead			1
" they do n't really care about the risks			2
some of them figure , ' if i do this dangerous stuff on top of the train , my friends will respect me more , ' " says @entity11			1
after stumbling upon an online video of the world 's 10 most dangerous sports that listed train surfing as near the top , @entity29 became curious about the practice			1
his inquires led him to @entity15 , where he spent a month getting to know the local community of staff riders			0
the film recently won @entity71 in the 2014 @entity72			1
" i did n't know what to expect , but what i found is that it 's really about social redemption , " he says			0
@entity15 is hardly a land of opportunity , especially not for young people			0
like many townships in @entity82 , @entity15 played a prominent role during the anti-apartheid movement , though living conditions have changed little since apartheid ended			0
according to the 2011 census , the youth unemployment rate in @entity82 ( the municipality of which @entity15 is a part ) is 37 %			0
" a lot of these guys are really young , from 15 to 25 years old			0
most of them are unemployed and have traumatic family situations			0
this is a way for them to socially reinvent themselves , " says @entity11			1
some seem to use the practice as a vent their frustrations			1
" it 's a way you can express your feelings , " @entity1 says in the film			2
" you want to take out the anger			0
instead of beating someone or robbing them , you just express your anger			0
" casino notes that many young people have lost one or both parents , either due to @entity116 , drugs or general poverty			0
" a lot of the guys i met grew up with their grandparents , who are old and do n't really have the energy or power to stop them doing this , " he says			0
though @entity29 shot footage from atop some of the trains , he admits that he was " gripping the irons			2
" " if you make one little mistake , you 're dead , " he says			0
" the last day of filming , two guys died while train surfing			2
i also met a lot of people that got injured and survived , which is not so common , because most of the time , they die			0
" the film features one such survivor : @entity142 , a sweet - faced , ambitious youth who dreams of working in advertising , and who unfortunately has suffered multiple amputations following a staff riding accident			1
" most of them do n't even realize the value of their own lives , " says @entity11			1
" for me , realizing that was one of the worst parts of this project			0
