-- a year ago , @entity1 , an 11 - year - old @entity2 girl , was fighting for her life while her family waged a campaign to change a national policy on lung transplants for child recipients			1
their battle has now led to permanent policy change			1
on monday , the @entity12 and @entity13 ( @entity14 ) and @entity15 ( @entity15 ) announced their decision to allow some children ages 11 or younger to receive additional priority for lung transplants , including lungs from older donors , according to a statement from @entity15			2
the previous policy required lung transplant candidates to be at least 12 to receive lungs from an adult donor			1
following an appeal by the @entity29 , in june 2013 a federal judge issued a restraining order to prevent the age - restriction policy from being imposed in @entity1 's case			1
@entity1 received lungs donated by an adult			0
the first transplants did n't take , requiring a second transplant , again from an adult donor			1
" @entity1 receiving adult lungs means she is now breathing on her own , " her family said last year , " after three years of being tethered to machines			0
" on monday , the family called her new lungs " beautiful " and said @entity1 will be returning to school in the fall			0
" @entity1 is still getting physical rehabilitation and we have work in front of us , " said the family , " but we are blessed there has been no rejection			0
" the new policy change to allow some child recipients to receive lungs from adult donors " is meant to provide an appropriate balance for a specific group of candidates , " a @entity15 statement said monday			1
the @entity1 family expressed excitement regarding the decision , saying in a statement also released monday that the policy change " is important for two reasons : more children will be fortunate enough to receive life - saving lung transplants , and the medical community has determined this is the right step to take			1
" the fight was not just about @entity1 , the @entity29 said , " because there was a very good chance it would have been too late for her -- but for every family in our situation			0
" several factors determine a potential child recipient 's place in line on the adult list , such as distance from donor to potential recipient , a lung allocation score determined by a patient 's diagnosis and test results , and a patient 's blood type			2
@entity1 's parents said her score was a 78 last year and went up to a 91 in june of 2013 according to a family spokeswoman			2
anything above 60 is considered a high score , according to the @entity14 's ranking system , and means a transplant need is particularly urgent			0
@entity1 's parents fought to change the policy regarding lung transplants because their daughter suffered from a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis			1
this illness led to a deterioration of her lungs			0
in light of @entity1 's case the @entity14 executive committee a year ago approved a one - year change to the age - restriction policy			1
today , @entity1 can be seen riding her bike outside , swimming , even kicking around the soccer ball			0
@entity1 's case received national attention and was widely covered by @entity0			2
according to policy documents , a high - profile media case was the catalyst for the first change in policy			0
@entity0 's @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .			0
