-- no doubt there is a sizeable audience primed for the latest @entity4 flick , and chances are quite a chunk of that crowd is looking forward to seeing how former teen idol @entity8 sizes up now he 's graduated from " @entity9			1
" well , he 's bulked up quite a bit , and he 's sporting something a little more than stubble , but the strong , silent type is not his natural forte			1
in " @entity15 , " @entity8 plays @entity16 , a @entity17 with three tours of @entity19 under his belt			1
if he 's come out alive he owes it to the photograph of a pretty girl he picks up in the rubble one day -- a snapshot that seems like a lucky talisman , protecting him while so many of his comrades fall			2
back home , he swears he will track down his guardian angel and tell her what she has meant to him			0
the lighthouse in the background gives him a clue as to where to start			0
they say that some soldiers develop a thousand - yard stare in combat			0
whether that 's what the 24 - year - old star was aiming for is hard to say , but he sleepwalks through this tearjerker with a blank look and delivers his ( admittedly awful ) lines with numb detachment			1
if @entity8 's going to make it as leading man he 's going to have to dig a lot deeper than this			1
because nature abhors a vacuum , @entity54 ( " @entity55 " ) steps it up and brings at least a modicum of life to the party as @entity59 , the divorced @entity60 kennel - owner who happens to be in the market for a dog walker			1
having walked all the way from @entity64 with his @entity65 @entity66 , @entity16 seems disturbingly well qualified			2
as for the plot , there is n't one			0
@entity59 has a gifted , but insecure son ( @entity71 @entity70 ) , one of those wry grandmas you see in this kind of movie ( @entity77 ) , and an ex-husband with a sheriff 's badge and a real bad attitude ( @entity82 , from " @entity83 " )			1
@entity16 walks the dogs , mends the guttering , fixes the tractor and bonds with the boy			2
no wonder @entity59 gets into a lather washing the dishes as she watches him			2
he even gets her motorboat ticking over again			0
director @entity93 ( " shine " ) bathes the whole show in an amber halo that makes the @entity97 look like an antiseptic shampoo commercial and shies away from anything that might be dramatically sticky , complex or even halfway interesting			0
the ex is such a boorish bully it 's laughable when @entity16 assures him he 's " not a bad guy " ( this after the drunken cop has threatened to shoot him and his dog ) ; @entity16 himself has the opposite problem -- he 's just too good to be true			1
it 's nice to see that @entity109 believes in virtue and decency and everyone just getting along			0
but virtue untested is not much of a subject , and this slight , unconvincing romance is a walk on the mild side .			0
