-- starting a legitimate business is hard , boring work			1
there 's paperwork to fill out , employees to hire , and all sorts of other drudgery , not to mention the biggest hurdle of all : providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay			0
president @entity13 foiled a gold scam			1
in all likelihood , it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets			1
or so it would seem			0
as many aspiring scam artists quickly learn , when a business scam fails , it tends to fail in rather grand fashion			1
just ask any of these four teams of not - so - smooth operators			1
a corny sea story @entity28 and @entity29 may not have been the world 's first white - collar criminals , but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence			1
in 360 b.c. , the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash			1
shipping was extremely risky at the time , and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency			0
to exploit this uncertainty , @entity28 and @entity29 devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from @entity49 to @entity50			1
due to the dangers associated with shipping , the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment did n't make it to @entity50 , so if the boat sank @entity57 and @entity29 could keep their cash			0
instead of loading the ship with expensive corn , the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days , then sink it and escape in lifeboats			1
since the boat itself was insured , this plot seemed airtight , and the potential profit was great			0
unfortunately , though , the boat 's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship			1
these passengers were understandably a bit peeved at @entity29 ' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain			0
@entity29 panicked and jumped overboard , at which point he drowned			0
unable to sink the ship by himself , @entity28 had to sail on to the port , at which point the buyer , @entity88 , wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty			1
a legal battle followed , and although the verdict has been lost by history , it 's safe to say that the late @entity29 regretted the scam			1
when friday went black despite his prowess as a general , @entity13 's presidency did n't go so smoothly			1
ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869 , when a group of speculators upended the @entity106 gold market			1
the plan started when financier @entity108 and robber baron @entity109 formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market , which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price			1
of course , one can only corner the market if there 's a fixed quantity of gold available			1
otherwise , the government could just sell large quantities of gold , and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure			2
in an effort to avoid this fate , @entity109 and @entity108 brought president @entity13 's brother - in - law @entity127 into their fold			1
using @entity127 's influence to get an audience with the president , the pair would argue to @entity13 that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs			1
the wily pair also used their influence at the @entity141 to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the @entity106 for @entity144 , who would warn them if the government started to sell gold			2
with their connections in place , @entity108 and @entity109 started buying up gold in september 1869 , quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent			2
once @entity13 and his advisors got wise to the situation , though , the government quickly sold off $ 4 million in gold to break the corner , effectively killing the inflated prices on september 24			1
as investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold , the price plummeted sharply , and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money			1
@entity108 and @entity109 managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury , but what would be known as @entity168 did n't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the @entity106 economy			0
bad moves if you 've ever hired movers , you know it can be pretty pricey			0
@entity177 , the founder of @entity178 , @entity180 - based @entity179 , understood that most movers were expensive , so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients			1
the customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply			0
that is , until the price went up			0
@entity177 's movers would load the company 's vans with all of a customer 's worldly belongings , then a foreman would inform the client that they 'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs			2
the price hikes were n't small , either ; one man 's estimate stated he could move for $ 3,000 but was later revised to $ 16,000 after loading			0
according to authorities , if customers balked at these demands , the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street ... and then charge them an unloading fee			0
if things got really sticky , @entity179 's trucks could just take off with all of the clients ' possessions			0
@entity177 supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong - armed customers into forking over the premiums			2
in the end , though , @entity177 learned that you ca n't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it			2
in 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion			0
three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket			2
@entity177 was sentenced to seven years in prison , after which he 'll face deportation to his native @entity238			2
fools for gold @entity240 was a small @entity241 mining company that made a big announcement in 1995			1
geologists had discovered gold on a site @entity240 owned near @entity246 , @entity247			2
not just a little gold , either -- at least 30 million ounces , possibly as much as 200 million ounces			2
given the high prices of gold , such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars			2
@entity240 's stock price shot through the roof ; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $ 280 @entity241			0
in fact , the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like @entity240 could not possibly handle it all without some help			0
in 1997 , the @entity247 government convinced @entity240 to take on an @entity106 firm as a partner to help extract the gold			0
when this firm , @entity263 , started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence , it reached a confusing conclusion : there was n't any gold in the soil			0
subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion			0
the " natural " gold that in the original samples @entity240 had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry			0
although the company 's market cap had climbed to $ 4.4 billion , this report quickly destroyed @entity240 's value			0
share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement , the company was soon removed from the @entity289 and @entity290 , and @entity240 quickly went bankrupt			0
amazingly , no one ended up in jail from this scam , but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on @entity297			1
