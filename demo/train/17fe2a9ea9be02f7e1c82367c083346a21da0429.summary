@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 reported more cholera deaths wednesday as chaos reigned in this country 's second - largest city , and cases among people who had traveled from @entity1 were reported in @entity9 and the @entity10			1
at least six people were wounded in related violence in @entity1			1
photos : cholera in @entity1 the cholera - infected woman who had recently traveled from @entity1 to @entity9 was recovering , the @entity9 @entity15 said			1
her case was identified through the state 's disease surveillance system and sent to the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , where it was confirmed , the state health department said			1
@entity9 , home to about 241,000 @entity1 - born residents , has asked local health care providers to watch for people who become sick or show symptoms of cholera after returning from travel to @entity1			1
" we are working with our health care partners to ensure appropriate care of this individual and prevent the spread of this disease within the community , " said state surgeon general @entity32			1
" we will continue to monitor the state for any future cases			2
" the first confirmed case in the @entity10 was a 32 - year - old @entity1 construction worker who returned friday from @entity1 with symptoms of the illness , the health ministry said tuesday night			1
the man , who was vomiting and had diarrhea , was hospitalized in @entity50 , near the eastern resort town of @entity52 , said health minister @entity53			1
the man was in stable condition , according to the newspaper @entity56			2
according to data provided by the @entity59 countries , the @entity10 is the second-most popular @entity59 destination for @entity62 tourists , only behind @entity63 , @entity64			1
more than 900,000 @entity62 have visited the island through august of this year			0
however , tourism and public health experts said that at the moment , the risk to tourists in the @entity10 were minimal			1
neither case was a surprise , said dr. @entity72 , team leader in @entity1 for the @entity22 in @entity73			1
" @entity22 has been expecting to see cholera cases elsewhere in the region , including the @entity62 , " he told @entity2 in a telephone interview			2
but he said cholera was unlikely to spread widely in the @entity62 or in the @entity10 , since both countries have public health infrastructures -- i.e. , chlorinated drinking water and intact sewage lines -- that are more robust than those in @entity1			1
in addition , health officials in the @entity10 , which shares the island of @entity86 with @entity1 , have been watching the epidemic spread across @entity1 for several weeks , during which they have been preparing by putting into place a surveillance system and educating the populace about what to do if they should come down with symptoms , he said			1
" we are very hopeful that the magnitude of the cholera problem in the @entity10 will not be on the scale of @entity1 , " @entity72 said			1
" diligence in public health messaging and people doing the right thing with water and food preparation and managing waste is going to be critical to that success			1
" in @entity1 , the outbreak had claimed 1,110 lives , the health ministry reported wednesday			1
another 18,382 people had been hospitalized with the disease			2
the hospital death rate was 4.0 percent , far above the 0.0 to 1.0 percent that infectious disease experts said they expect in developed countries			0
" it 's telling me that the treatment is not optimal in the hospitals , " said dr. @entity115 , a professor emeritus at the @entity116 at @entity117 in @entity23			0
" it leaves something to be desired			0
" the risk factors in @entity1 make that country " a perfect storm " for the disease to spread , @entity115 said			1
he cited " a highly susceptible population , crowding , flawed infrastructure and a virulent strain " of the bacteria , which the @entity22 reported this month as having resistance against some drugs commonly used to fight the infection , though other commonly used drugs -- including tetracycline -- are effective against it			0
though a vaccine against cholera exists , " health authorities generally have mixed feelings because it is expensive , it has some serious limitations and mobilizing the population to get the vaccine is problematic , " @entity115 said			1
aid agencies appealed for calm in the northern port city of @entity0 , where angry demonstrators accused @entity149 peacekeepers of starting the outbreak			0
residents erected burning barricades , then hid in alleyways and pelted convoys of armored personnel carriers driven by @entity149 peacekeepers as they drove past			0
@entity0 convulsed in a third straight day of violence			0
at @entity160 , the city 's main hospital , doctors treated a patient with a gunshot wound on wednesday afternoon			2
soon after , wheelbarrows holding two more patients were rolled into the hospital			0
one man had an apparent bullet wound to the chest , the other a bullet wound through the leg			2
" @entity177 shot them , " said a man pushing one of the wheelbarrows and referring to the @entity149 forces in @entity1 by their acronym			1
during the night , a medical worker told @entity2 that the hospital had received three more patients with gunshot wounds			1
the violence occurred as medical workers struggled to cope with a dramatic increase of patients infected with cholera			2
at a basketball stadium that has been turned into a makeshift cholera treatment center , dr. @entity188 of the humanitarian group @entity189 ( @entity189 , known in @entity190 as @entity189 ) estimated nearly 200 new patients had arrived overnight			2
at noon , an elderly woman joined the arrivals , her head slumping as she was rolled in a wheelbarrow through the gates of the compound			2
the stadium was packed with patients on cots , many of them being rehydrated with intravenous fluids			0
those patients who did not fit into the main area were being quartered in a hallway underneath the stadium risers			0
@entity189 workers said a child died overnight at the stadium			0
they also said that some patients had been unable to reach the treatment center , their way blocked by protesters who continued to prevent most cars and trucks from traveling the streets of this port city			0
at one of the burning barricades in the center of town , angry residents chanted in @entity225 for the @entity149 to go away as white @entity149 armored - personnel carriers rolled through piles of burning garbage			0
the @entity149 has a peacekeeping force of more than 10,000 foreign police and soldiers deployed in @entity1			1
the global body has denied @entity1 assertions that @entity235 peacekeepers had introduced the cholera bacteria to @entity1			1
aid workers said the tense situation on the streets of @entity0 was hampering medical and logistical efforts			0
aid agencies have suspended clean water projects to slum areas , and canceled flights to deliver soap and other supplies to affected areas , a statement from aid agencies said			0
supplies in @entity0 were running out and the medical staff was overwhelmed as cholera mortality numbers climbed , said @entity253 , coordinator for humanitarian action for the @entity149			2
" we call upon all involved in these clearly orchestrated demonstrations to stop immediately so national and international partners can continue to save lives with our response to the cholera , " @entity253 said			2
" every day we lose means hospitals go without supplies , patients go untreated and people remain ignorant of the danger they are facing			2
it is vital that everything possible is done to contain this outbreak in @entity0 while we still can -- but this is very difficult in the current environment			0
" @entity271 , head of the @entity189 mission in @entity1 , said the organization 's medical staff members were able to continue treating patients in @entity0 as they have been for the last 10 days			1
but , he said , " it is not an easy environment to work in			0
" in the capital , @entity73 , @entity271 said the number of cases @entity189 is treating has increased significantly			0
in the northern slum of @entity283 , @entity189 doctors were seeing 10 times the number of patients than they were seeing last week , he said			0
@entity189 has been increasing bed capacity every day and hoped to raise it to 800 by the end of wednesday , @entity271 said			0
" it 's not enough , " he said			0
as capacity rises , so do the number of patients			0
meanwhile , the @entity292 announced wednesday that it has committed $ 1.5 million for cholera response in @entity1			1
the foundation said in a news release that it plans to partner with @entity1 's health ministry to train 10,000 community public health workers across the country			1
also , it will purchase and distribute 10,000 portable treatment packs containing oral hydration salts , soap , aqua tabs , chlorine , hand sanitizer , garbage bags , educational material and stationery			0
the other $ 500,000 will be spent on a national awareness campaign			0
" the recent outbreak of cholera is a devastating development for the people of @entity1 , and serves as an important reminder of all that remains to be done in our work to help @entity1 build back better after the earthquake , " said former president @entity312			1
the last cholera epidemic in the @entity323 began in @entity324 in 1991 and spread to some 16 other countries , from @entity326 to @entity327 , according to the @entity328			2
from 1991 to 1997 , @entity324 alone saw more than 650,000 cases			0
a similar pattern in @entity1 could produce some 270,000 cases , which means public health officials likely face long - term challenges in @entity1			1
the @entity149 denied an assertion promoted by some @entity1 that @entity235 peacekeepers were responsible for starting the cholera outbreak			1
@entity149 statements said the protests may be politically motivated to create insecurity ahead of november 28 elections			0
symptoms of cholera , an acute , bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water , can be mild or even nonexistent			2
but sometimes they can be severe : leg cramps , profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting , which can cause rapid loss of body fluids and lead to dehydration , shock and death			0
journalists @entity353 and @entity355 and @entity2 's @entity356 , @entity357 and @entity358 contributed to this report .			0
