" piracy has flourished recently off the coast of @entity85 , which has not had an effective government for two decades			0
while piracy in the @entity105 has taken place for years close to the @entity85 coast , " in 2008 we saw a very marked and rapid shift into the @entity109 , where @entity85 pirates were attacking and hijacking vessels very , very regularly , " said @entity112 , manager at the @entity113 in @entity114			2
international navies combating piracy have been fairly successful in setting up a patrolled transit corridor through the @entity109 , @entity112 and @entity28 said			0

" most of the people who embark on those kinds of missions are well aware of ( the dangers )			0
they 're surrounded by prayer and uplifted by their friends and family			2
... if they feel called , they typically go			0
" @entity49 said the @entity16 did n't feel comfortable arming themselves while in dangerous waters			1
@entity16 had noted , among other things , that " if you take a firearm on board and you stop at certain ports , your boat can be confiscated along with your cargo , so he did n't want to risk that			1

the group , which organizes long - distance group cruises , said the @entity22 broke off on february 15 after leaving @entity182 , @entity183 , to take a different route			1
