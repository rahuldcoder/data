-- on a warm summer afternoon in @entity4 last february , an @entity2 friend dropped me off in the charming historic neighborhood of @entity7 on her way to work			1
" you should go see a murga tonight ! " she said			2
my only association with murga was a love song by one of my favorite musicians , @entity17 singer @entity16 , called " @entity18 " : " con mi amor yo quiero bailar / @entity18			1
" my @entity19 was n't good enough to understand the entire song , but the lyrics i did get seemed pleasant : something about summertime , a shower of stars , the end of carnival and how he wanted to dance with his love			0
did i want to see a murga ? @entity30 ! hearing the drums of the murga so as the sun set over the @entity34 , i wandered away from the tourists sipping cappuccinos and mates as they watched tango dancers in @entity39 , one of the city 's historic squares			2
several blocks later , the tourists had vanished and the smoke of a sidewalk asado , a huge @entity2 - style barbecue , filled the air as lanky men in tank tops demonstrated their grilling prowess			1
in the distance , i heard the drums of the murga			2
@entity55 , it turned out , is far from a slow , romantic dance			1
it 's a lively form of street theater that became a prominent part of carnival celebrations in @entity17 and @entity2 at the turn of the 20th century			1
if you happen to be in this part of the world during carnival , which generally begins in late january or early february , it 's also a great way to experience regional culture and history			0
@entity55 originally came from @entity70 , @entity71 , but transformed in the @entity34 region into a unique cultural expression also rooted in other @entity75 and @entity76 traditions of music and dance			1
it first flourished in working - class , immigrant neighborhoods of @entity2 and @entity17 , drawing on sounds of daily life : calls of street vendors , melodies of popular songs and , fundamentally , @entity76 drumming			1
@entity76 rhythm pulses through the music during the 18th and early 19th century @entity19 colonial era , enslaved @entity76 in the region developed elaborate drumming rhythms called candombe , which became a way of preserving their cultures and stories			1
today it continues to thrive , particularly in predominantly @entity99 - @entity17 neighborhoods in @entity100			1
this is the pulse of murga			2
but murga also has distinct differences in each country			2
in @entity2 , murga corsos are parades in which performers from a given neighborhood , many dressed in satin frock coats and top hats , drum and dance through the streets until reaching a staging area			1
there the musicians sing and play nasally horns while agile dancers swirl and kick and jump to the rhythm of the bombo , tambor and cymbals in a blur of sequins and feathers			0
in @entity17 , carnival lasts 40 days ( it 's the longest in the world )			1
this year it started january 25 and will continue until early march			0
@entity55 performances here are much more regimented and elaborate			1
they incorporate a greater variety of musical instruments , powerful choral song and costumes that recall commedia dell'arte - like characters with painted faces , colorful capes and plumed hats or other outrageous headgear			0
filled with parody and political satire @entity55 competitions are televised , and groups practice exhaustively for months to develop and perfect their routines in secret -- serious prize money is at stake			1
the groups perform in theaters and tablados , outdoor staging areas constructed all over @entity100 , and may travel to several venues in one night			0
murgas in both countries incorporate social and political criticism			0
but @entity17 murga places more explicit emphasis on parody and political satire , often achieved by playing with the lyrics of well - known songs and even advertising jingles to construct clever , humorous critiques of everything from presidents to soccer teams to social issues			1
in a country where people often feel overshadowed by neighboring @entity2 , these distinctions count			1
" @entity55 is one of the only things that a lot of @entity17 feel is only theirs			1
so it 's viewed with a lot of pride , " said @entity174 , a professor of world music at @entity176 in @entity177 who studies @entity17 murga			1
despite the differences , the tradition remains , in both countries , by and for the community			0
murguistas are not professional singers and dancers , but working people -- bakers , vendors , mechanics and factory workers			1
they achieve a certain celebrity status during carnival , but they derive their material from the joys and struggles of family and neighbors , placing everyday life in a larger sociopolitical context			0
repressive regimes banned the murga @entity55 's association with working - class neighborhoods , unions and political satire made it a target of the countries ' right - wing dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s , when thousands of people deemed threatening to the regime were forcibly disappeared			1
during this period , murgas tended to align with leftist ideals , in opposition to the repressive regimes , said @entity174			0
officials responded by barring murga performances in public streets and censoring lyrics			2
political messages became more subtle as murguistas found new metaphors to circumvent the restrictions			0
" during dictatorship it became a place where people could in a coded way talk about what was going on , " said @entity174			2
" ( @entity235 ) were saying what people want to say and what they could n't say			2
there are a lot of metaphors especially from that period around light , home , spring ... that was the role that the murga played during the dictatorship -- giving hope			2
" today murga is undergoing a renaissance			2
popular musicians are integrating the traditional rhythms of candombe and other characteristic murga elements into rock , jazz and other genres			2
dedicated murguista masters have introduced it to young people through neighborhood workshops , now with government support			0
and while many younger murguistas have abandoned some of the hard - edged political rhetoric that developed in response to dictatorship , murgas remain a venue for clever social and political commentary			0
@entity4 , @entity2 carnival in @entity2 is february 2 - 24			1
look for performances in the following neighborhoods , which offer among the most authentic murga experiences			0
and word to the wise : do n't dress up for murga			0
more than likely you 'll be caught in the crossfire of a popular carnival street fight involving water bombs , shaving cream and children who take no prisoners			0
@entity285 : high - end housing and restaurants are transforming this neighborhood of old factories and barracks near the city 's port area			0
but it retains vestiges of its working - class roots , even as it has begun to blossom as a center for art and community cultural events			1
@entity300 : this immigrant neighborhood maintains a rough - and - tumble reputation , but today it also has a well - established tourism industry			0
sit at a sidewalk cafe with a glass of wine against a backdrop of quaint , brightly painted houses known as coventillos before taking your place to watch the local murguistas			0
@entity7 : one of the oldest neighborhoods of @entity4 , @entity7 will meet every romantic 's expectations : cobblestone streets , wrought iron balconies , antique markets and tango			0
the outskirts of @entity7 , away from the throngs of tourists , is a staging area for murga			0
@entity100 , @entity17 it 's well worth spending a couple of days in @entity100 -- a three - hour ferry journey from @entity4 across the @entity34			1
carnival here is under way and continues into early march			0
@entity330 : it 's one of the most important venues for official murga competitions , but smaller open - air tablados also host cheap murga performances throughout the carnival season			1
it 's best to buy tickets well in advance , especially if you 're planning to see the top acts compete in the finals			0
@entity343 and @entity344 : @entity348 drumming performances and llamadas , a call - and - response procession or parade , occur in these traditional @entity99 - @entity17 neighborhoods			1
like murga , they are central features of carnival , but you generally do n't need a ticket			0
@entity356 is a great place to learn more about the history of murga and other carnival traditions			2
the museum can also recommend venues for murga , candombe and llamadas .			0

both @entity17 and @entity2 have rich traditions *honoring* murga
@entity55 is a lively form of street theater
working people practice for months to star in televised competitions and street celebrations
@entity55 has its roots in @entity71 but was transformed by the drumming of enslaved @entity76
