-- football fans appear to have a love - hate relationship with the @entity3 , according to a new @entity0 / @entity5 poll			1
on one hand , most appear unmoved in their views of the @entity3 after controversies like alleged bullying between @entity11 players and the murder case involving former @entity14 tight end @entity13			1
some 75 % percent of respondents said claims of racist and violent communications between suspended @entity11 guard @entity18 and teammate @entity19 had no effect on their view of the @entity3 overall			1
about the same number -- 78 % -- said @entity13 's murder case did not shake their views of the league			1
but about three out of four respondents said that overarching issues of violent behavior and bullying among players are serious enough that something should be done about them			1
the poll results underscore the complicated way fans may try to reconcile the entertainment value of the @entity3 with violence in professional football			1
no issue captures that dichotomy more than concussions			0
issues surrounding brain damage , and other potential long - term cognitive and emotional consequences of repetitive brain trauma , are now practically synonymous with the @entity3			1
in august , thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the league in a lawsuit that put the issue under the microscope			0
the deal calls for the @entity3 to pay $ 765 million to fund medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for retired @entity3 players and their families , and litigation expenses , according to court documents			2
head impact sensors : on - the - field placebo or danger ? at the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs ' allegations that the @entity3 led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its @entity70 -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks			2
more recently , former player @entity74 said he struggles with memory loss and personality changes and was told he shows signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity78			0
the progressive degenerative brain disease has been found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma			0
and former player @entity83 told a radio talk show that he has had memory lapses			0
perhaps because of that attention , 36 % of poll respondents said they view the @entity3 less favorably based on its handling of the concussion controversy			1
sixty percent say it has no effect on their views			0
on the topic of @entity3 injuries overall : about half of the public believes that something should be done about them , while the other half views them as part of the game			1
the same number say they view the @entity3 less favorably when players inflict intentional injuries on opposing players ; 50 % view that style of play as part of the game			1
the scales tipped dramatically for respondents when it came to youth football players and concussion ; 80 % of the public considers concussions sustained by middle school and high school players to be a serious problem			2
and when asked to weigh two scenarios -- the possibility of having to pay fees for their child to play football , or concussions they could sustain while playing -- 64 % said concussions mattered more to them , while only 25 % said paying to play was more important			0
a poll released last month by @entity130 and the @entity131 showed that one in three @entity132 said that knowing about the damage concussions can cause would make them less likely to allow their sons to play football			2
high schools tackle football concussions " historically , youth football has fueled the @entity3 , " said @entity138 , director of the @entity139			1
" parents ' concern about the safety of the game could jeopardize the future of the sport			0
" a report from the @entity148 , also released last month , found that high school athletes who play football , lacrosse , soccer and baseball were more likely to experience concussions than college - age players			0
respondents in the @entity0 / @entity5 poll included 843 people interviewed by telephone november 18 - 20			2
of those , 51 % identified as football fans , and 8 % said they were " somewhat fans			0
" forty - one percent of people polled were not football fans			0
the sampling error was plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .			0

poll respondents say bullying , murder case does *n't* affect their view of @entity3
but a *majority* say something should be done about violence , bullying
about half think something should be done regarding football injuries
