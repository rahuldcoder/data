every other character on the show who has left @entity16 's ad agency has either never been heard from again , or revisited in a one - off episode and then rarely to never heard from again			1
@entity9 , by contrast , had been such an integral part of the show 's exploration of the 1960s that the thought of completely losing her â € ” and the @entity26 - nominated @entity10 â € ” had some fans in a wee bit of a snit			1
