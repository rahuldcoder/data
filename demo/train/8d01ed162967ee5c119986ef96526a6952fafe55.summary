three likely presidential candidates shared the stage sunday night before a roomful of wealthy donors , engaging in a rapid - fire policy discussion that underscored sharp disagreement within the @entity7 over global affairs and national security			1
@entity7 sens. @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 took part in a largely friendly , but occasionally fiery , panel at the @entity16 event sponsored by mega @entity7 donors @entity18 and @entity19 , better known as the @entity20			1
the event , moderated by @entity23 's @entity22 , marked the first time potential @entity7 contenders gathered on the same stage at the same time to talk about policy in 2015 , a year that 's expected to see a hoard of candidates compete for the @entity7 nomination in forums and debates			1
@entity34 : 2016 race kicks off with auditions in @entity37 it also offered a window into the unofficial campaign that 's largely playing out behind the scenes , with @entity43 hopefuls traveling the country and meeting privately with donors — in settings much like the @entity48 desert sunday — to gauge the kind of the financial commitments they could secure for a 2016 endeavor			0
the first - term senators were keenly aware of their immediate audience — at one point @entity11 blatantly said , " i admire @entity19 and @entity56 " — but knowing their remarks would be public , they also sought to show off their command of the issues in a high - pressure scenario			1
the senators revealed little disparity on domestic and economic policies , but roughly half way into the event , the discussion shifted toward president @entity68 's new @entity67 policy — and @entity12 instantly found himself on defense			1
" i 'm kind of surrounded on this , " @entity12 joked			1
@entity10 and @entity11 both have parents who emigrated from @entity67 , and @entity12 is also the odd - man - out on substance , being the only one on stage who 's backed the president 's call for relaxing the @entity67 embargo			1
the @entity80 @entity7 explained that in hindsight , president @entity85 " made the right decision " by opening relations with @entity83 , saying it prevented war and opened up trade			0
" @entity83 not a good example , " @entity10 disagreed , saying the country may be " more prosperous ... but it is not a free country			1
" that launched the two into a deeper debate over whether the @entity95 should place sanctions against all countries with a record of human rights violations			0
" i 'm not a big fan of a lot of these regimes but i do n't want to isolate ourselves and not trade with people who are n't perfect , " @entity12 said			2
his answer was also a masked response to critics who label him an isolationist due to his push for less intervention abroad			0
@entity10 , answering @entity12 , stressed that @entity67 stands out because of its close proximity to the @entity95 " the difference is that @entity67 's 90 miles from our shores , " @entity10 said			1
" what happens there we will feel immediately			0
" the negotiations with @entity119 over its nuclear weapons program also became a major flash point on the panel			0
@entity12 is supporting @entity68 's push to avoid imposing sanctions against @entity119 while the negotiations are still ongoing			2
" diplomacy is a good thing , not a bad thing , " @entity12 said			2
his argument , however , failed to generate much excitement in the room			0
that 's when @entity10 swooped in to warn that the @entity95 is dealing with a country that 's run by someone whose mission is " to bring the whole world under the flag of @entity138			2
" " so i am a little cautious ... about negotiating with someone who has openly said he wants to force all of us to either be like him or die , " he said , generating a strong response from the audience			0
@entity11 also won heavy applause when he underlined the threat of @entity138 extremism , declaring that a nuclear @entity119 would be the single biggest threat to the @entity95 and argued @entity147 and the country 's leaders are " radical religious @entity138 nutcases " who " glorify death or suicide			2
" combating @entity138 extremism was a common theme saturday when potential candidates , including @entity11 , took turns speaking at a marathon event in @entity37 , where attacks on @entity68 's foreign policy , in particular with regard to @entity161 , stirred some of the loudest responses from the audience			1
each of the senators delivered an impressive grasp of the issues , firing off statistics on a wide range of topics and punctuating their positions with personal stories that touched on their own background			0
but it was @entity10 who commanded the most time , delivering fast - paced but forceful answers			1
he jumped first at questions and frequently sat on the edge of his seat as he would crescendo into some of his more impassioned arguments , like on @entity67 or @entity119			0
style-wise , @entity10 sported a suit and looked the part of his day job , while @entity12 donned a navy sport coat with blue jeans , and @entity11 wore the same tan colored coat he wore to a conservative event in @entity37 the day prior			1
@entity10 , who has already said he wo n't run for re-election to his @entity194 seat in 2016 if he runs for president , held the middle seat of three seats and drew frequent laugh lines in addition to applause			2
when @entity22 asked if the super wealthy have too much influence on elections , @entity10 made the audience roar when he quickly rattled off a snarky response that both validated his audience and took a shot at the left			2
" as opposed to @entity210 or the mainstream media , you mean ? " while all three men praised @entity214 on a personal level , none expressed any faith that the 2012 @entity7 nominee would be successful in another bid at the @entity43			0
@entity12 said @entity214 would have been a better president than @entity68 , but when asked if a revised @entity214 campaign would fare better in 2016 , the @entity80 @entity7 joked : " i 'm kind of with @entity220 on this one ' no. no. no. no. never '			2
" ( it was actually @entity214 , not his wife @entity222 , who repeated the word " no " 11 times to the @entity225 last year when asked if he planned to run again ) the next nominee , @entity12 argued , needs to be someone who can " reach out and appeal to new constituencies , " and he questioned whether the millionaire with a long history in politics would be able to strike that " visceral connection " with " enough people to win a general election			1
" for his part , @entity11 used @entity214 's infamous comments about nearly half the country being dependent on government to illustrate his case against the 2012 nominee			2
" the reason @entity7 lost can be summed up in two words : forty - seven percent , " the @entity243 @entity7 said			0
" i do n't just mean @entity214 's comments that were caught on tape ... the central narrative of the last election , what the voters heard , was we do n't have to worry about the 47 %			0
" " i think @entity7 are and should be the party of the 47 % , " he added , seeking to drive home a message about the @entity7 needing improve its standing with middle class voters			0
things certainly grew tense when the discussion focused on foreign policy , but the men did n't deliver any blows or direct attacks against each other on stage			1
in fact , @entity11 tried to round out the event with a glowing tribute to his soon - to - be rivals			0
the senator , who was elected in 2012 , pointed out that both @entity10 and @entity12 mounted long - shot @entity194 bids in 2010 and won despite facing establishment money and resources			1
" all of the money in their state was against them , and they ran campaigns that inspired me , inspired me to run , " said @entity11 , who also won an underdog campaign			0
instead , knowing it 's never a bad idea for republicans to attack the media , they directed any confrontational tones towards @entity22 for trying to get the men to give " yes or no " answers			0
" when and if any of these people run for president , there should be an absolute rule : no ' yes or no ' questions , " @entity12 said to the moderator , drawing applause from the audience and getting a " here , here " from one of his colleagues on stage .			1
