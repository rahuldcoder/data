when @entity1 and his dad travel this week to @entity3 , @entity4 , for the @entity5 , it will be a bucket - list experience			1
and yet for them it will be so much more			0
for @entity1 , a @entity10 native , it 'll be a chance to thank his father , @entity12 -- the man who never stopped fighting for him while he spent 10 years behind bars for a crime he did n't commit			1
" being able to do this with my father after all he 's done for me , sacrificing 10 years of his life to prove my innocence -- that 's when it became real , " said @entity1			1
the father - son pilgrimage came about last month when a ticket distributor who had heard about his story offered @entity1 an all - expenses - paid trip to sunday 's game			1
the 30 - year - old , who now lives in @entity27 , was released from prison in 2013			1
@entity1 's 12 - year nightmare began on november 1 , 2001			1
he and his friend @entity30 , both then 17 , were drinking illegally at a college bar in @entity32 , @entity10			1
about five blocks away , @entity34 sports editor @entity33 turned off his computer after a long night and left the newsroom shortly after 2 a.m. , according to court documents			0
in the newspaper 's parking lot , someone struck @entity33 from behind and strangled him with his own belt			2
police interviewed a janitor , @entity44 , who said he could n't identify the people involved in the slaying			2
but two years later , @entity30 told police he had " dream - like " memories of committing the crime , according to court documents			1
@entity1 told police that he remembered driving @entity30 home before going home himself			1
but after @entity30 implicated him and @entity44 changed his account , @entity1 was charged with murder and convicted in 2004			1
when @entity1 's father , @entity57 , awoke the day after his son 's arrest , he was devastated			1
" ' @entity60 , i got to get to work , ' " his father , now 70 , recalls thinking			0
" it 's like watching one of your children drowning			2
i had to do something			0
" " i started reading the police reports over and over , " said the real estate agent			0
" i made a timeline and flow chart of all the depositions			0
i started questioning people on my own , and i dug up a lot of witnesses			0
" each week , @entity1 's father visited his son in the maximum - security prison where he was held			1
they would share updates , compare notes and work on the case together			0
@entity1 served a quarter of his 40 - year sentence while his family and friends campaigned to free him			1
after two key witnesses admitted that they had lied , a court of appeals overturned his conviction in november 2013 and @entity1 walked free			1
@entity30 is serving a 25 - year sentence in a @entity10 prison			1
no one else has ever been charged in the case			0
" can you imagine wiping out everything you did in your 20s ? " @entity1 said			1
" that 's what it ( spending 10 years in prison ) is like			1
" after he was freed , @entity1 did not feel safe in his hometown			2
the case had gotten a lot of attention locally , and a lot of people knew who he was			0
@entity1 said he feared the legal system which had put him , an innocent man , in prison			1
" i love @entity32 , @entity10 , " he told @entity6			2
" if it was n't for the authorities , i 'd go back			2
" while in prison , he worked out religiously and began writing his first book , about physical fitness			2
upon getting out , he moved to @entity27 , became a certified personal trainer and earlier this month , published " @entity118 : a guide to @entity120			0
" " the crazy thing is i saw him more when he was in prison , " said his father , @entity57 , who still lives in @entity10			1
" he 's been incredibly busy			2
we get together around once a month			0
" @entity126 has always been a way to bring the father and son together			0
" i played football in college and high school			0
he was brought up on it , " @entity57 said			0
" it 's a vernacular for us , a way for us to get together and have something to talk about			2
" for the elder @entity1 , the best part of the @entity5 trip will be getting to spend a few days with his son			1
" we 'll get to watch one of the greatest sports possible , and we 'll get to spend a lot of time , just the two of us , together , " said his father			0
@entity147 , co-founder of @entity149 - based @entity148 , had watched @entity151 's " @entity150 " special about @entity1 a few years ago			1
in november , he saw a follow - up about @entity1 being released from prison and wanted to do something nice for him			1
" whatever cost we incur , it 's worth it , " @entity147 said			2
" he 's got an amazing attitude			0
after talking to him a number of times , i ca n't wait to meet him			0
" it took @entity147 about a month of trying to connect with @entity1 on @entity163 and other channels before his offer was taken seriously			2
" it seemed like one of those things that were too good to be true , " said @entity1			2
" in my life , i 've learned to leave things alone that are too good to be true			0
" @entity6 first learned of the news from freelance writer @entity173 , who uploaded the story to @entity175			0
at first , @entity1 did n't have much of a reaction to the @entity5 offer			1
" the excitement , joy and happiness did n't hit until i talked to my dad , " he said			2
" we were screaming on the phone , ' yeahhhhh ! ' " while @entity1 does n't have a @entity5 favorite -- he 's just excited to see " amazing people do amazing things " -- his dad is rooting for the @entity186 in their matchup with the @entity188			1
" when we were in @entity192 , we were so impressed with their spirit , " said @entity57 , referring to a trip in 2014			0
" it 'd be difficult for us not to be supporters			0
" the father and son will spend a long weekend together , reveling in football fandom and their shared bond			0
and making up for lost time			0
" being locked up for 10 years meant no college and i never even sent a text or posted a @entity163 update or used a smartphone , " @entity1 told @entity202			1
" i will get to go to the @entity5 with my dad			1
it 's a dream come true			0
this is a golden opportunity and one that i will never , ever forget for the rest of my life			0
