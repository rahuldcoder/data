-- in august @entity1 revealed that its new headquarters in @entity3 , designed by @entity4 , will be , according to company founder @entity5 , " the largest open floor plan in the world "			1
over 3,000 people will work on moveable furniture in a space that stretches over 10 acres			1
but are open plan offices better suited to the machinations of architects and needs of a company rather than to employees ? open plan offices came out of a drastic rethinking of architecture , by mid- 20th century proponents like @entity21 ( who thought walls were " fascist " ) and @entity23			1
in the 1960s , @entity24 , a designer for @entity25 , noticed people had their best ideas or did their best thinking when they left their desks			2
his action office furniture , released in 1968 , introduced cubicles to the world , in an attempt to revitalize a landscape that @entity24 had described as " the daily scene of unfulfilled intentions and failed effort			1
" research by @entity40 professor @entity39 in 2006 discovered that people communicate the most with those in a 50 meter radius , and that complex topics are best discussed face to face			0
but there are problems with open plan offices			1
according to a study by @entity52 researchers conducted over a decade , most workers find " speech privacy " the biggest problem			0
as a result some suggest that rather than foster more useful conversations they may actually inhibit them			1
a 2000 study by @entity60 and @entity61 suggested that the constant distraction of colleagues ' noise dampens employees ' motivation			0
even @entity24 revised his initial thoughts on cubicles			0
in a 1998 he said " crass people " had managed to use his idea to " create hellholes "			0
" they make little bitty cubicles and stuff people in them			0
@entity76 , rat - hole places , " he told @entity75 magazine			0
yet just as it did for an expanding postwar workforce , today , adjustable workspaces make economic sense and account for much of their enduring popularity			1
" you can put more people together in the same space and fill it up without separating walls , " says @entity84 , architecture editor for @entity86 newspaper @entity85			0
he adds that open plan designs also allow more light into deep buildings , and are cheaper to heat			1
10 technologies that will change your workplace " for employers , it 's very easy to rearrange the workstations to account for changing needs			1
it is especially well suited for temporary types of work			1
you easily share information using an open space -- you get to know what 's going on , if you 're working on the same project , " he says			1
" the client likes to build them that way , and the architects like to draw them because you can get more dramatic spaces when you 're operating with one big scale instead of having to make a lot of repetition of small spaces "			2
in some ways , an open plan makes an organization transparent to itself			1
you can see your colleagues , and they can see you			0
" that is quite important , to feel some kind of unity , " says @entity84			0
" you 're part of something bigger than yourself when you 're working in the open space			2
" however @entity84 believes that open plan offices suit managers better than employees , and suggests that the problem of noise spillage goes deeper than merely finding it difficult to concentrate			1
" most people feel stressed when they first move to an open space			2
you do n't have a private sphere anymore , so you ca n't personalize your workdesk in the same way			0
you 're deprived of your individuality			0
" are cool offices the key to success ? when employees moved into @entity152 's new headquarters in @entity153 , @entity84 says , " they had three psychologists working full time for them , just to accommodate the problems around the new office			1
" @entity84 notes that ( not unlike @entity1 's influence on society ) , open plan " changes the balance between private and public "			1
" it 's okay to watch @entity161 clips or read irrelevant pages out in public , " he says			2
" all these human inclinations , there 's no need to hide them			2
" but for other human inclinations -- such as the inclination to fight -- private space is still a necessity , says @entity84			0
" you have to have a room where you can go and have an argument without everybody listening in			0
it 's a problem if a building ca n't accommodate that			2
" 8 ways to make your office life better like @entity183 , he believes workspaces should encourage creative thought , but he believes this is being addressed in a patronizing way -- " they have all these entertaining rooms , with perhaps a playground			2
" a more important consideration is to make employees feel important , " to somehow empower the employee so they feel that they are necessary for the product			0
" @entity84 believes an open plan office " sends a signal that you are interchangeable " , and argues that , if employees do n't have dedicated spaces they can personalize , they are more likely to feel that their job is temporary			1
" i think that is kind of a sad development			0
