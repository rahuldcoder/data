@entity0 -- rep. @entity2 has lost patience with president @entity4 over his response to the surge of minors from @entity8 crossing the southern border			1
the @entity11 lawmaker has criticized the administration 's handling of what it has called a " humanitarian crisis , " and is urging a reluctant @entity4 to visit affected areas			1
he 's also unwilling to write @entity4 a blank check for his $ 3.7 billion proposal to @entity19 for addressing the matter			0
" we just ca n't just trust the president and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want , " he told @entity1 in an interview			0
he also says he hopes @entity4 's decision to skip a border visit does n't become his " @entity29 moment , " a reference to how the heavily criticized federal response to the devastating hurricane and its aftermath was a defining moment in @entity36 's presidency			1
@entity2 's sentiment is right in line with @entity40 critics giving @entity4 heat over the unexpected influx of minors from @entity8 , many of them unaccompanied , and now mired in bureaucratic limbo and caught in the middle of a partisan political firefight			1
but @entity2 's a @entity48 who is going after a president of the same party in a high - stakes election year during which immigration has gained prominence as a campaign issue			1
he told @entity54 on wednesday that he 's gotten calls and visits from @entity58 officials but is not giving much thought to that			0
what 's going on ? " i 'm more concerned about my constituents , " @entity2 said , noting the perils facing the tens of thousands of kids coming across the border in record numbers and overwhelming border and immigration services			2
while the current crisis is taking place in @entity2 's back yard in conservative - led @entity11 , his crossing of @entity4 and @entity70 is not new for him			1
he was endorsed by the @entity74 during his 2006 primary and backed @entity36 in the 2000 election that propelled him to the @entity58			0
his bruising 2004 primary battle for the @entity58 seat then held by rep. @entity79 , who at the time headed the @entity81 , won him few friends in the caucus , comprised of @entity70			0
@entity2 endorsed @entity84 over @entity4 for the 2008 @entity70 presidential nomination and even raised money for her campaign			2
he also was one of 27 democrats who voted against @entity91 reform legislation backed strongly by @entity4 early in his presidency			0
and in 2001 , @entity93 gov. @entity93 's appointed @entity2 as @entity11 secretary of state , a post he held for 10 months			2
democrats were unhappy about @entity2 's 2012 support of a redistricting proposal backed by the @entity93 administration			2
critics said he supported the proposal in an effort to ensure a favorable district for himself , a charge he denied			0
some democrats also question @entity2 's latest move : a plan to introduce bipartisan legislation on thursday with @entity11 @entity109 sen. @entity109 to address the southern border situation			1
that measure favored by @entity40 members would reverse a @entity36 - era law that allows illegal immigrant children from @entity8 countries to stay in the @entity116 as their cases wend through the backlogged adjudication process			0
rep. @entity119 , a staunch immigration reform advocate , said on @entity1 's " crossfire " on wednesday " i would n't not support the legislation			0
" after @entity4 's @entity11 trip , what now for the immigration crisis ? @entity126 on immigration : when will @entity4 take responsibility ? @entity4 seeks emergency immigration funds , more authority @entity1 's @entity131 contributed to this report .			1
