editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of " the @entity3 : @entity5 's @entity4 , " , which was the basis of a @entity9 video documentary released in november			1
he is a reporter for @entity11			0
@entity2 says @entity13 's immigrant heritage helped drive his advocacy of a more open @entity5			1
( @entity15 ) -- with a sign from @entity23 , @entity24 , hanging in his @entity18 @entity17 office , a reminder of the famine - ravished farm where his ancestors began , sen. @entity13 always seemed to understand that the @entity3 were perhaps @entity5 's greatest immigrant story -- overcoming religious , ethnic and cultural barriers to reach once unimaginable heights			1
" my brother @entity28 wrote ' @entity29 ' in 1958 , and his words ring true as clearly today as they did half a century ago , " said @entity13 early last year , a few months before he was struck with a malignant brain tumor that claimed his life tuesday			2
" i 'm constantly reminded of my immigrant heritage			2
" indeed , the @entity3 ' vision of " @entity29 " -- which @entity13 championed throughout his public career -- dramatically transformed today 's @entity5 , opening the door for millions of new citizens and paving the way for @entity38 's presidency			1
it is the @entity3 ' most lasting legacy			0
@entity43 's idealistic belief in @entity5 's dream of opportunity for all was clearly stated in " @entity29 , " which reflected so much of his family 's story as @entity49 immigrants			2
the essence of this little known , little - studied book became the 1965 @entity52 , which ended the discriminatory preference given to white @entity54 and opened the door to millions from @entity5 , @entity56 , @entity57 and around the world			0
first proposed by president @entity13 in july 1963 , a few months before his assassination , the bill was passed in his memory , pushed by his two brothers in the @entity64 and signed by president @entity65 beneath the @entity66			1
@entity13 was particularly proud of its passage and referred to it often in public			0
no law in our lifetime has done more to change the demographics of modern @entity5			0
many historians routinely ignore , or give only a passing nod , to the underlying forces of ethnicity and religion that so often influenced the @entity13 family 's actions and outlook			2
often their years in power were lionized as " @entity84 " by the press			0
but as @entity13 realized , a comparison to @entity88 royalty hardly seemed proper for the great - grandson of an @entity91 migrant worker who fled from a @entity23 , @entity93 , farm during the @entity94			0
that @entity23 sign in @entity13 's office was a reminder of the @entity3 ' sense of their own immigrant heritage , their epic encounters with religious bigotry , and how the complex dynamics of their family life reflected the @entity49 experience in @entity5			1
from his grandfather , former @entity107 mayor @entity43 " @entity106 , young @entity13 heard of the great wave of @entity91 immigrants to @entity5 that included their family			1
and in the 1990s , the efforts of @entity13 and his sister , @entity18 ambassador @entity113 , to bring peace to their ancestral homeland seemed to reflect their deeper sense of being @entity91 , of being @entity49 and of being members of a family coming from an often oppressed immigrant minority			1
@entity13 went back to @entity24 many times , including to the old @entity13 homestead in @entity23			0
the culmination of this @entity13 's immigrant legacy was most apparent by the 2008 presidential campaign , which offered many reminders for @entity13 of the barriers his brother faced in 1960 , becoming the first @entity18 president from a minority background			1
most notably , @entity38 , the @entity18 senator from @entity130 , possessed a style and dignity particularly reminiscent of the @entity13 era			1
at a key moment in the primary campaign , @entity13 publicly supported @entity38 who , in turn , said the @entity13 family always stood for " what is best about @entity5			1
" @entity38 's campaign faced many tests similar to those that @entity43 endured in 1960 as the first and only @entity143 elected to the presidency			1
as a minority , born to black and white parents , @entity38 had to overcome code words and subtle biases historically applied to african - americans			0
like @entity49 hard - liners who complained that @entity13 was n't " catholic enough " in 1960 , @entity38 was sometimes criticized within the black community for not seeming " black enough " in 2008			2
and yet when the media made it seem @entity38 had been attacked for his minority status , african - americans rallied to his support , just as @entity143 did in 1960 for @entity13			2
@entity13 's dramatic embrace of @entity38 's candidacy carried a powerful symbolism , one of the last significant acts of his distinguished career before he fell ill. from the broadest vantage , the @entity13 story reminds us of the glories and the limits of @entity5 's melting pot and those histories that paint people from minority groups in familiar " just like us " tones			1
we gain a better grasp of the @entity3 ' appeal beyond @entity49 -- to countless other immigrant and minority groups who share a dream of ascendancy in @entity5			0
in this context , our understanding of the @entity3 becomes richer , more complex and of greater historical significance to what @entity43 called a nation of immigrants			0
it recalls how far we 've progressed as a country since the 1960 election , and yet how many barriers still remain today			0
no one understood that better than @entity13			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity13 's heritage was of an immigrant family that broke barriers
@entity2 says the @entity13 brothers pushed wider opening of @entity18 borders in 1960s
he says *resulting* demographic change helped usher in president @entity38 's election
@entity2 : like @entity43 , @entity38 's background is much different than other presidents
