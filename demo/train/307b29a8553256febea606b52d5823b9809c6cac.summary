a man weeps by a grave			0
he lowers his head and murmurs a few quiet words			0
he sits awhile , glances intently at the writing on the headstone , he uses the palm of his hand to wipe away the dirt			0
his eyes glaze over with a look of hopelessness , almost pleading for something to happen			0
the man rises , turns and leaves			0
that night he gets his answer -- the curse lives on			2
despite being finalists on seven occasions in various major @entity22 finals -- in 1963 , 1965 , 1968 , 1983 , 1988 , 1990 and in 2013 -- each time @entity23 have been unable to bury the famous curse			1
a condemnation that even the prayers of his famous protege @entity29 could not lift that day in @entity0			0
" every year when @entity23 plays in the @entity22 they try to get rid of the curse , " @entity31 journalist @entity30 told @entity34			1
" any time that @entity23 play near @entity26 's grave , somebody will take flowers			1
" the way @entity23 were beaten by @entity41 in wednesday 's @entity43 final in @entity44 -- @entity46 's injury - time header securing the @entity49 side 's 2 - 1 win -- if you were fan of the @entity31 side you could have been forgiven for thinking some other powerful force was at work			1
even in death , @entity26 is determined to have his own way -- much to the anguish of a club he left in anger after taking it to the peak of @entity22 football in the early 1960s			1
a charismatic and sometimes eccentric genius , @entity26 revolutionized football during a coaching career which spanned 25 jobs in 13 different countries before he passed away in 1981 , aged 82			1
@entity67 born into a @entity70 family in @entity71 in 1899 , @entity26 , like his parents , became a trained dance instructor before switching his focus to football			1
after becoming part of the @entity77 side which won the league title in 1920 and 1921 , @entity26 left for @entity0 following the rise of @entity80 under @entity82 's regime			1
it was here , among the @entity1 intelligentsia , that he flourished , taking in the political and literary debates in @entity0 's coffee - house society			0
there he joined the exclusively @entity70 football club @entity90 , where he won the league title in 1925 as well as winning four caps for @entity93			1
after traveling on a tour to the @entity95 with @entity90 , @entity26 decided to stay put in @entity96 only to lose a considerable amount of money in the @entity100 crash			2
that forced the nomadic traveler to move on once again , first back to @entity0 where he took on a coaching role with @entity90 before joining @entity105 side @entity104			0
but @entity26 's life , like those of so many other @entity70 , was turned on its head during the rise of @entity110 in @entity22 and the @entity67 which killed six million people			1
" @entity26 was hugely talented , " says leading football writer @entity112 , author of the book " outsider : a history of the goalkeeper			2
" " he was tactically very astute but also very awkward and difficult , " @entity112 told @entity34			0
" he was very quick to take offense			0
" the central theme with @entity26 is the war			2
we do n't know how he survived it , and the fact he skips over it in his book could mean one of two things			0
" did he feel guilty for surviving or did he compromise himself to stay alive ? " or , perhaps it was that the memories were just too painful to share and that the loss of so many of his loved ones meant he did n't speak about it			0
" he was hugely successful but there was something tragic about him , which probably comes from that time			0
" famine while family members , including a brother , perished in concentration camps , @entity26 escaped to @entity138 where he was held in internment			2
it was n't until the end of the war in 1945 that he returned to football , this time in @entity144			0
it was here , in 1946 with club side @entity147 , that he demanded to be paid in vegetables at a time when famine was a growing problem			0
while parsnips and carrots were gratefully received , @entity26 's relationship with the board was never a particularly healthy one			2
when a club director began to interfere in team selection , @entity26 finally lost patience			1
his fiery temper and attitude of " my way or the highway " earned him plenty of attention , especially from the media			0
following spells with @entity170 and @entity171 in @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 in @entity175 and @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity26 hit the big time with @entity179 in 1953			2
his team led the @entity182 table after 19 games in his second season , only for another run - in with the board to curtail his tenure			2
" i have been sacked , even though i am neither a criminal nor a homosexual , " he told a shocked press conference			0
" nomadic career years later , on his first day as the manager of @entity23 , he fired 20 players before leading the club to the @entity31 title			1
" he was an incredible man , " @entity112 said			0
" did he become a parody of himself ? did he do those kind of things because people expected it ? " i do n't know			0
but it was clear that he never wanted to stay in one place for long , he was always moving			0
" that could have been because of the war , but also because he was looking for the next pay check			0
" it was in @entity31 , after a successful spell in @entity208 , that @entity26 really secured his legacy , securing back - to - back @entity211 with @entity23 in 1961 and 1962			1
it was the first time that any club other than @entity214 had won the competition			0
during his time in @entity217 with @entity218 between 1957 and 1958 , where he won the league title before moving to @entity221 , @entity26 introduced the 4 - 2 - 4 system which @entity217 used at the 1958 @entity223			2
inspiration it was a system that laid the groundwork for the great @entity217 sides to establish themselves as masters of the beautiful game			0
@entity26 had taken some inspiration from the great @entity232 , the man who coached the " @entity233 " in the 1950s			1
under @entity235 , also of @entity70 descent , @entity93 became the first nation to defeat @entity49 on its home soil , winning 6 - 3 in 1953 before reaching the @entity223 final the following year			2
from 1950 until the @entity240 in 1956 , the national team won 42 games , drew seven and lost just once --- in the @entity223 final against @entity243			0
@entity235 preferred a 3 - 2 - 1 - 4 formation which allowed @entity245 , the great @entity93 striker , to thrive alongside the precociously talented @entity246			2
that slowly changed to the 4 - 2 - 4 formation which would inspire @entity23 to @entity22 and domestic glory			1
" i never minded if the opposition scored , because i always thought we could score another , " @entity26 once said			2
his thirst for innovation and his psychology degree , which he earned in his younger days , helped him become a leading figure in man - management and a master tactician			0
at @entity23 , it was the arrival of @entity29 which allowed @entity26 to play @entity261 in a deeper position and unleash one of the most attacking teams of the era			1
@entity23 defeated @entity266 3 - 2 in @entity267 in the 1961 @entity269 final before coming from behind to beat then five - time winners @entity214 5 - 3 the following year			1
but where there was triumph , disaster was never far away			0
" from the moment he arrived in @entity31 , @entity26 's relationship with @entity23 was destined to be complex , " says @entity31 football expert @entity274			1
" after the second @entity269 victory , @entity26 approached the recently - elected president @entity279 with what seemed an eminently reasonable request -- a pay rise			1
" @entity279 chose to turn @entity26 down , whereupon the @entity93 departed with what has become a well - worn parting shot : a simple declaration that @entity23 would not win another @entity269			1
" @entity26 's curse has proved painfully prophetic -- the @entity287 have lost five @entity269 finals in 1963 , 1965 , 1968 , 1988 , 1990 , the 1983 @entity43 final and now the @entity43 final			1
" @entity292 comparison remembered for his uncompromising attitude , his innovation on the field and his nomadic existence , @entity26 's story gained further resonance following the emergence of @entity31 coach @entity292 , a @entity22 champion with @entity221 in 2004 and @entity301 in 2010 after beginning his career with a brief spell at @entity23			1
" @entity26 's prickly personality and relentless pursuit of success have led to comparisons with @entity292 in some quarters , " @entity274 told @entity34			2
" what is certainly true is that both left @entity23 in unfortunate fashion , and both departures became matters of considerable regret for the club			1
" the results of @entity26 's ' curse ' have been well documented , whilst presidential candidate @entity318 's stated wish to replace @entity292 with club legend @entity319 following the 2000 elections led to ' the @entity321 ' taking his talents elsewhere			1
" in a similar scenario to that which led to @entity26 's tenure coming to an end , @entity292 approached @entity318 with a contract extension request shortly after his election ( and a 3 - 0 win over @entity331 ) , which was denied			1
" @entity318 's opponents have dined out on that mistake since			0
" as for the @entity23 's players the task of finally closing the book on @entity26 's curse continues .			1

@entity26 was a @entity93 *jew* who survived the @entity67
he led @entity31 soccer team @entity23 to @entity269 glory in 1961 and 1962
after leaving @entity23 , he left a " curse " that the club would never win it again
@entity26 coached in 13 different countries , before dying at the age of 82 in 1981
