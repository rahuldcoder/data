" i 'm supportive of what the president has done going into @entity15 and @entity16 , but you have to see this thing through , " the @entity10 @entity9 said tuesday on @entity12 's " @entity11			0
" @entity1 suggested in an interview with @entity21 ' " @entity20 " that his policy of sending no @entity5 combat troops will stay in place			2
the situation in the region is more a political problem than a military one , he said			0
according to a @entity12 / @entity31 poll , the overwhelming majority of @entity5 ( 73 % ) support the current airstrike campaign but less than four in 10 favor sending combat troops into @entity16 and @entity15			0
if @entity1 's administration ultimately comes to @entity36 with a plan to send combat troops to @entity16 and @entity15 , @entity0 said he would support it			1
" i think the president should come to @entity36 with an authorization of force resolution and i would support it , " he said			0
" and i would help the president pass that because i think it 's necessary to see this threat through			0
" " we need to destroy @entity8 , and we need to do what it takes to destroy @entity8 , " he continued			2
@entity49 : @entity8 ' rise like ' watching a train wreck ' @entity0 , the 2012 @entity9 vice presidential nominee and a potential 2016 presidential contender , said that he does n't think " whole divisions " will be needed			1
" this is not a 100,000 boots on the ground campaign , but i do believe , based upon our experiences in @entity16 and @entity59 in particular , that having @entity61 teams embedded with indigenous fighters and a coordinated air campaign has been very successful for us in the past			1
" @entity66 ' disturbed ' by @entity1 on @entity8 @entity0 , who said " we have been getting briefings on @entity8 for ... a couple of years , " stood by the president 's current actions so far , but suggested more needs to be done			1
having enablers on the ground to help guide the air campaign and avoid civilian targets would be helpful , he said			2
" what i fear is the president is micromanaging the military in such an incremental way , making the same mistakes we 've made in the past , " he said			0
" we need to see this thing through and let the military do it as fast as possible			0
" how could @entity1 have ' underestimated ' @entity8 ?			1
