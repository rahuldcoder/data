-- @entity3 's @entity2 squad boycotted training on sunday in protest at the decision to send home star striker @entity7			1
in a bizarre twist , coach @entity8 had to read out a statement from the team to explain their decision			1
" all players without exception want to declare their opposition to @entity16 ( @entity16 ) decision to exclude @entity7 , " he said			1
" for its part , the @entity16 has at no time tried to protect the group			0
" they made a decision without consulting all the players , only on the basis of the ' facts ' reported by the press			1
" " accordingly , and to mark their opposition to the highest level of @entity29 football , all players decided not to participate in the work - out			2
" @entity7 sent home after @entity33 row despite their refusal to train , the players added that they would " do everything individually and in a collective spirit so that @entity3 regains its honor against @entity38 on tuesday			1
" @entity3 must beat the hosts and hope the result of the other match in @entity42 between @entity43 and @entity44 goes their way to have any chance of qualifying for the last 16			1
their hopes were dealt a near fatal blow by a 2 - 0 defeat to the @entity52 on thursday , after which it emerged that @entity54 star @entity7 and under fire coach @entity8 had a massive row at halftime			1
@entity7 was substituted but reports of his tirade against @entity8 were picked up by the media , prompting the @entity16 to take the decision to send him home on saturday			1
captain @entity63 was incensed by the leak , claiming there was a " traitor " in the @entity29 camp			0
as the squad came on to the training ground at @entity70 on sunday , @entity8 and @entity63 were still in discussion on the team bus			1
the pair eventually emerged , but @entity63 then became involved in a shouting match with fitness coach @entity75 , who reacted by angrily throwing down his official accreditation badge			2
the squad , who said they only turned out to greet fans , promptly walked off and were joined by @entity8 on the bus , after which he emerged to read out the statement			1
to add to the chaos , a distraught @entity3 team director @entity81 publicly announced his resignation to the media			2
" ask the players , they do not want to involve themselves any more			0
it 's unacceptable , " he told @entity88			0
" they do n't want to train			0
it 's a scandal for the @entity29 , it 's a scandal for the federation and the @entity29 team			0
" it is a shame			0
as for me , it 's over			0
i 'm leaving the federation			0
i 'm sickened and disgusted			0
" @entity43 sink sorry @entity3 2006 runners - up @entity3 have picked up just one point from their two games , a dull goalless draw with @entity44			2
but it was the lackluster display against @entity43 which provoked a storm of criticism , much of it directed at @entity8 , who is standing down after the @entity2 finals			2
@entity8 , who is being replaced by @entity106 , told the @entity16 official website that @entity7 could have stayed had he apologized for his halftime remarks			1
" i had another chat with him ( @entity7 ) the next day and i left open the possibility for him to apologise , something which he did not want to do , " he said			2
" the decision to exclude him was the right one			0
he does not have the right to say such things			0
