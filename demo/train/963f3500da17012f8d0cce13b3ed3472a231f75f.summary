-- a nurse with @entity2 may have shown symptoms of the virus as many as four days before authorities once indicated , meaning that she might have been contagious while flying on not just one , but two commercial flights , officials said thursday			1
@entity9 was hospitalized tuesday , one day after she took a @entity11 flight from @entity12 to @entity13			1
tests later found that @entity15 -- who was among those who cared for @entity17 , the first person diagnosed with @entity2 in the @entity18 , at @entity13 ' @entity19 -- had @entity2			1
authorities indicated @entity15 had a slightly elevated temperature of 99.5 degrees @entity22 , which was below the fever threshold for @entity2 , but did n't show any symptoms of the disease while on her monday flight			1
this is significant because a person is n't contagious with @entity2 , which spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids , until he or she has symptoms of the disease			1
but on thursday , dr. @entity34 of the @entity35 told reporters in @entity37 that " we have started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as saturday			2
... we ca n't rule out ( that ) she might have had the start of her illness on friday			0
" " so this new information now is saying we need to go back now to the flight that she took on friday the 10th and include them in our investigation of contacts , " said @entity34			0
the @entity35 announced later thursday that is " expanding its outreach to airline passengers now to include those who flew from @entity53 to @entity12 on @entity46 " last friday -- which is how @entity15 got to @entity37 , from @entity54 , originally			1
can you catch @entity2 on a plane ? the medical director in @entity58 , @entity37 , where @entity15 spent time before returning to @entity54 , told @entity0 that two things have changed : what the @entity35 defines as a " contact " of someone with @entity2 and more information has been gathered on how @entity15 was feeling			1
" what the @entity35 has discovered , through interviews , is that she may not have been feeling well earlier than we initially thought on ( monday ) , " said the director , dr. @entity64			0
" ... it was nothing you could point your finger at and say , ' ah , this is a particular disease , " @entity64 added			0
nonetheless , the new information " kind of signified that maybe she had the illness longer than what she had when ( hospitalized )			0
" her uncle , @entity15 , said thursday night that his niece did n't feel sick until tuesday morning , when she went to the hospital with a temperature of 100.3 degrees ( which is still below the @entity35 's @entity2 threshold )			1
yet a federal official with direct knowledge of the case gave different information to @entity0 's @entity83 , relating that @entity15 said she felt fatigue , muscle ache and malaise while she was in @entity37			1
she did not have diarrhea or vomiting while in that state or on the flight home			0
the fact health officials are working from this latter assumption -- that @entity15 may have been ill for longer than once thought -- could significantly expand the number of people who might have been in contact with @entity15 while she was contagious			2
earlier , @entity35 director dr. @entity97 had said there 's an " extremely low " risk to anyone on @entity11 's @entity12 - to - @entity13 flight , though his agency was reaching out to all 132 passengers as part of " extra margins of safety			1
" @entity11 is also grounding its six crew members for 21 days -- the maximum time between when a person can contract @entity2 and show symptoms -- out of what its ceo says is " an abundance of caution			1
" @entity11 now says it is notifying up to 800 passengers total , a figure that includes those on last friday 's @entity13 - to - @entity12 flight , the return flight four days later , plus five subsequent trips taken by the plane used in that last flight			1
and now " 12 confirmed contacts of @entity9 in @entity37 ... are currently under quarantine , " according to @entity58 's assistant health commissioner @entity123			1
they include at least two people who worked at a bridal store , where the 29 - year - old nurse went as part of her wedding planning			0
latest @entity2 developments nurse moving to @entity133 hospital @entity15 was flown wednesday to @entity135 's @entity134 , where her uncle @entity15 said she is " feeling ok			1
" workers at that hospital -- which previously treated @entity18 @entity139 and @entity140 for @entity2 -- are also caring for an unnamed person with @entity2 who came there september 9			2
another person being treated for the virus , freelance @entity147 cameraman @entity146 , is " getting better every day " at @entity148 , hospital spokesman @entity143 said thursday			0
the fourth person with @entity2 in the @entity18 , @entity19 nurse @entity150 , arrived via plane in @entity152 on thursday night			1
she was then transported , by ambulance , to the @entity133 hospital in @entity155 , @entity152 , just outside @entity156			2
the @entity13 hospital said that transferring @entity150 " is the right decision ( because ) many of the medical professionals who would normally staff the intensive care unit ( are ) sidelined for continuous monitoring			2
" some 76 workers who cared for @entity17 , like @entity15 and @entity164 , have been asked to do things like regularly take their temperatures to gauge whether they have @entity2			1
@entity19 's critical care medicine chief dr. @entity168 said " she has improved so much in a short period of time			0
" @entity164 sounded upbeat and grateful in the same statement about her upcoming move to @entity152			2
" i 'm doing really well thanks to this team , which is the best in the world , " @entity164 said			0
" i believe in my talented co-workers			0
" how the ebola virus spreads many of those co-workers are subject to heightened concern and scrutiny , due to their involvement in @entity17 's care			0
to that end , @entity13 mayor @entity186 told @entity0 's @entity188 on thursday night that about 50 people from @entity19 have signed a document legally restricting where they can go and what they can do until they totally clear of @entity2			1
among other things , they 'll be placed on a " @entity194 " that would prohibit them from flying commercially like @entity15 did			2
( @entity97 " they ca n't take public transportation			0
they must have personal monitoring twice a day , " @entity198 said			0
" furthermore , they can not go to public places			0
" complete coverage on @entity2 schools closed , @entity205 deployed to @entity206 that was n't the only government move thursday related to @entity2			2
in @entity54 ' @entity210 , several schools shut down because two students were on the same @entity12 - to - @entity13 flight as @entity15			1
two schools in the @entity215 school district in suburban @entity12 also closed because a staffer " traveled home from @entity13 on @entity11 on tuesday on a different flight , but perhaps the same aircraft " as @entity15 , the school district said in a statement			1
in @entity156 , president @entity222 voiced opposition to a travel ban from the countries ravaged most by the virus but did signal openness to appointing a so - called " ebola czar " to focus on the issue at home			0
he also signed an executive order authorizing the deployment of @entity205 troops to @entity206 -- where most all of the nearly 9,000 reported @entity2 cases and 4,500 deaths have been occurring , according to the @entity235 -- to help authorities there deal with the devastating outbreak			2
@entity222 : ebola czar ' may make sense ' @entity242 and @entity54 health officials faced heated questioning on @entity244 about how @entity2 has been handled so far in the @entity18 and how it will be handled in the future			1
dr. @entity246 -- the chief clinical officer for @entity19 's parent company , @entity247 -- admitted hospital staff " made mistakes " the first time that @entity17 visited there in late september , letting him leave despite his symptoms and the fact he 'd just come from @entity206			0
" we did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of @entity2 , " @entity246 testified thursday to the @entity18 @entity254			0
" we are deeply sorry			0
" 5 things nurses say the @entity54 hospital got wrong while procedures may change -- especially after some well - publicized mistakes -- @entity97 said his agency 's overarching goal will not			2
" our top priority , our focus is to work 24/7 to protect @entity18 , " @entity97 said			0
" that 's our mission			0
" @entity18 health officials grilled on @entity2 at congressional hearing @entity0 's @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			2
