-- it has been nearly four weeks since @entity2 went to the polls and the country is still drifting rudderless without a functioning government			0
this week , political leaders are holding two days of crucial talks with @entity2 's ceremonial president of the republic , @entity8			1
the talks began wednesday morning and are expected to conclude at 6 p.m. thursday in @entity11			2
@entity2 's february elections were inconclusive , and have created a political gridlock that is hobbling the country 's economy			2
the nation is currently in its longest recession in 20 years			0
it 's economy -- @entity20 's third - largest with a government debt the @entity22 puts at $ 2.6 trillion -- shrank by 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 , @entity19 says			2
after the elections failed to produce a government , international ratings agency @entity24 downgraded @entity2 's credit rating from a- to @entity29 + and warned of further risks if political uncertainty continues and reforms and austerity measures are stalled by a lack of a functioning government			2
@entity2 's hung parliament met for the first time on friday , when ministers began the process of electing leaders of the lower house and the @entity42			1
@entity43 , 51 , a former journalist and spokeswoman for the @entity45 of the high commissioner for refugees , won a strong majority as the speaker of the lower house			1
@entity50 , 68 , an anti-mafia magistrate from @entity51 , became the speaker of the @entity42			0
at a news conference tuesday , @entity43 and @entity50 pledged to push through legislation that would cut salaries and benefits for members of parliament by 30 %			0
@entity2 lawmakers are among the highest paid in all of @entity20 , according to a @entity19 poll in 2011			0
" we are asking for the same kinds of sacrifices to our pay that @entity2 are suffering through the recession , " @entity43 told @entity0 by telephone			0
but @entity2 is still lacking a functioning prime minister			1
none of the country 's top leading parties currently has enough support to lead the country single - handedly , and none of the leaders have so far showed a willingness to form a grand coalition or support each other 's candidates for the prime ministerial role			0
@entity8 said at a news conference tuesday afternoon that during this week 's talks he will first attempt to persuade leaders to support @entity82 of the center - left @entity83 as prime minister			1
@entity82 fared the best in the february elections by leading a leftist coalition to a small majority in the lower house of parliament			1
but he was unable to win a majority in the @entity42 , where it counts			0
instead , power in the @entity42 was divided between @entity82 and former prime minister @entity96 's center - right coalition , anchored by his party , @entity97 , or @entity97			1
@entity82 and @entity96 are arch - rivals who have indicated they will not work together			1
@entity82 's platform included judicial reforms that reverse legislation passed when @entity96 held office , including expanding statutes of limitations on financial crimes and stripping political leaders of immunity			1
@entity96 is currently awaiting a verdict in a trial in which he stands accused of paying an underage prostitute for sex on more than 13 occasions and abusing his office to protect her in an unrelated crime			0
the verdict is expected to come in early april			0
last year , @entity96 was convicted of tax fraud			0
last month , he was convicted of publishing illegally acquired wiretaps in his brother 's newspaper			0
he is appealing both convictions			0
@entity96 has indicated that he does not agree with @entity82 's judicial and criminal reforms and that he would not work with the center - left as long as those items are on the agenda			1
the election deadlock has meant that @entity127 , a former comedian and political revolutionary who led his grass - roots @entity130 to third - place in the elections by promising to get rid of @entity2 's tired politicians and traditional political parties , would be the key to power if he were to support one of the traditional parties			2
but since the elections , he has refused to work with either @entity82 or @entity96 , resulting in the political gridlock			1
he has said no to a political or technocratic government , leaving little room to negotiate			0
@entity127 , continuing to rebuff @entity82 's attempts to work together to form a coalition , friday called @entity82 " dead man talking			1
" but his own party is showing some fractures			0
a dozen of its members in parliament voted against the party 's candidates in the elections last weekend to choose the parliamentary leaders			1
@entity127 , who is not a member of parliament and did not run for office , lambasted his unfaithful party members on his personal blog			0
@entity160 , who led @entity2 in a technocratic role after @entity96 resigned under pressure in november 2011 , did not win enough support in the february elections to bolster either side , and his austerity platform is not seen as a draw for support			1
he has been acting as prime minister since the election produced no winner , but he threatened to walk off the job last weekend during the debate over electing the parliamentary leaders			1
saturday , @entity8 asked @entity160 to stay on in his caretaker role until a government can be formed			2
" it is important for @entity20 , and to exercise whatever initiatives are possible and necessary , especially for the economy and jobs , the government remains under the authoritative leadership of @entity160 until a new government is formed , " @entity8 said in a written statement			2
@entity8 's intervention meetings on wednesday and thursday will either confirm @entity82 as a prime minister or produce a technocratic leader who will guide the country forward to inevitable early elections , likely either in june or next autumn			1
to further complicate matters , @entity8 's mandate as president ends on may 15			2
in accordance with @entity2 's electoral law , the president can not dissolve parliament or call new elections with less than six months left in office			2
that means that either with or without a prime minister , @entity2 's hung parliament must begin the process of electing a new president to replace @entity8			1
that process will start on april 15 with the nomination of candidates , a step subject to a fair amount of backroom horse - trading			0
@entity96 recently said in an interview on his @entity212 television network that he would consider agreeing to @entity82 as prime minister if his center - right ally , @entity214 , were elected president of the @entity216			1
other presidential candidate names mentioned by members of parliament in interviews with the @entity2 press include @entity160 and respected @entity224 leader and former @entity225 member of parliament @entity226 .			0

talks led by president @entity8 begin wednesday in an effort to forge a government
@entity8 said he will first try to get agreement on @entity82 as prime minister
@entity82 's party holds the lower house , but is vying in the @entity42 with @entity96 's party
with no agreement , new parliamentary elections would be *scheduled*
