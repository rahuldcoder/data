@entity0 -- the increasing use of the internet by political campaigns presents hackers and spammers with growing opportunities for abuse , according to two internet experts			2
@entity10 is director of emerging technologies for @entity12			0
@entity10 , director of emerging technologies for @entity12 , a computer security firm , said he has seen attacks of only moderate severity but warns much more damage could be done			1
those attacks include : phishing , or e-mails designed to look legitimate but which take respondents to fraudulent sites ; adware , or ads that appear through pop - ups or banners on web pages ; and spyware , which secretly monitors computer users			1
fraudulent web sites and plain old lies are also used			1
" campaigns , extremists and others who may not be associated with the campaigns are very likely to start participating in these types of attacks , if not in this election , then in future elections , " @entity10 said in a presentation this week to a @entity35 computer information security conference in @entity0			1
according to @entity12 , an e-mail was sent last week to several hundred people urging them to click on a link to see a video of @entity50 presidential candidate sen. @entity49			0
the people who did so inadvertently downloaded a malicious code that made their computers start spewing spam			0
other incidents have involved the theft of money and personal information			0
in 2004 , for instance , supporters of the @entity50 presidential ticket of @entity61 and @entity62 received an e-mail soliciting donations			0
it provided a link to a site on which people were directed to enter their credit card information			0
authorities do n't know how much money was collected , where it went or how much credit card information was compromised			0
with @entity77 fundraising proving to be a blockbuster success for candidates , @entity10 said he believes more thieves will try to exploit it			1
some cons operate through " typo squatting			1
" for $ 8 a month , anyone can register a domain name that closely resembles the internet address of a campaign			2
if an attacker then establishes a web site that closely resembles a candidate 's , unsuspecting supporters could make donations			2
the campaign would never get the money , but the attacker would			0
@entity10 said his research shows that typo squatting is in wide use			1
hundreds of domain names close to those of the presidential candidates have been registered , some of them in @entity104 and @entity105			1
these domain names have been used to establish web sites on which to sell advertising or make political points			1
others are used to mock candidates			0
a slip of the finger while navigating to @entity113 's web site , for instance , could send a user to @entity117 , which portrays the former first lady as a character from " @entity120			0
" candidate web sites themselves also can be hacked , and visitors to the sites could find their computers infected with viruses or worms			1
" i 'm sure it is happening now , " said @entity128 , vice president of security awareness for @entity129			0
@entity128 said all web sites , including political ones , are targets			1
" web sites are being attacked on a daily basis by individuals , non-state actors , organized criminals and state actors , " he said			2
" web sites are seen now as the perfect storm because you can attack the users that use them to access the information and visitors who use those sites , who trust those sites			2
" the internet might also be used to distribute disinformation about candidates			2
politically motivated hackers could even post inaccurate information on a candidate 's site , @entity10 said			0
attackers are rarely caught , according to @entity10			1
it is easy for " attackers to remain completely anonymous and to never be discovered , " he said			0
if the exploitation and corruption of political information on the @entity77 grows as @entity10 predicts , he said he fears the public could become wary of internet fundraising and even become suspicious of political information available on the @entity168			1
" it certainly has the potential to not only disrupt but potentially cause voters to lose faith in the electoral system , " he said			0

politically related @entity77 attacks moderate so far , security expert says
with @entity77 fundraising a success , thieves may be more likely to strike on web
bogus sites with @entity185 close to candidates ' sites take advantage of " typo squatting "
internet attackers rarely caught , expert says
