@entity0 -- the new @entity2 is still a month and a half away from being seated , but the battle for the next @entity2 is already heating up			0
and the fight for the 2014 @entity5 may end up being the most compelling storyline as the dawn of the midterm campaign approaches			1
after failing to take advantage of a golden opportunity to win back control of the chamber this year , the @entity9 gets another chance in 2014			1
the democrats , with big victories in the 2008 election , will be defending 20 of the 33 @entity5 seats up for grabs in 2014			1
if it sounds familiar , it is			0
thanks to their success in the 2006 midterms , the @entity15 defended 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs last week			1
in fact , they expanded their majority by at least one seat and probably two -- depending on which party @entity27 , the senator - elect from @entity29 , caucuses with -- from their current 53 - 47 majority			2
analysis : it 's never too early to talk about 2016 " it would be easy for someone to say the @entity15 ' were on the defensive in 2012 and they did just fine , ' but i do n't think any two election cycles are exactly the same			1
we have to see what the political environment looks like ; we have to see what candidates and nominees emerge ; we have to see what kind of retirements we have			0
those are the factors that play into how successful a party will ultimately be in the upcoming election , " says @entity48 , deputy editor of the non-partisan @entity49			0
and the current lame - duck session between now and the end of the year could also impact the next election			2
difficult votes on avoiding the fiscal cliff in 2012 could come back to haunt some senators facing difficult primary or general election challenges in 2014			2
among the most vulnerable @entity62 senators up for re-election in 2014 are ( in alphabetical order ) : @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 of @entity68 , @entity69 of @entity70 , @entity71 of @entity72 , @entity73 of @entity74 and @entity75 of @entity76			0
democrats may also have some open seats to defend			0
sen. @entity79 of @entity80 is an obvious candidate to retire			0
he 'll be 90 by november 2014			0
and @entity81 of @entity82 will be 77 by the midterms			0
republicans and @entity15 proclaim optimism on fiscal cliff deal " there are some vulnerabilities on the @entity62 side , but a lot of it depends on how popular the president is in the midterms and the quality of the @entity9 challengers against these @entity62 senators , " adds @entity48			1
a senior @entity9 strategist argues that president @entity98 's victory last week makes it tougher for some of those @entity15 facing challenging re-elections			1
" the irony of this past election is that if you 're @entity73 , @entity75 , @entity71 or other targeted @entity15 , it would have been easier for each of them politically if president @entity98 had not been re-elected			1
because the president 's liberal , big government agenda , and their longtime support for it , will undoubtedly play an even greater role in each of their races next cycle , " says the strategist , who spoke to @entity1 on the condition of anonymity			0
but the @entity119 , the group that focuses on getting @entity15 elected to the @entity5 , disagrees			1
" last week 's results proved that conventional wisdom is often wrong , especially two years out from @entity122			1
we 've proven we can win in red states , we can overcome steep spending deficits , and we can defy the odds even when the map is tilted against us			0
remember only two @entity62 incumbents have lost reelection in eight years , " @entity119 communications director @entity128 tells @entity1			0
opinion : conservatives , do n't despair the 2014 geography seems friendlier to the @entity9			1
of the 13 @entity9 seats up for grabs next november , only @entity134 of @entity29 comes from a state that 's not solidly red			1
the moderate @entity9 senator has n't said if she 'll retire or run for another term in 2014			1
some of the @entity9 up for re-election , including minority leader @entity141 , could face potential primary challenges			2
regardless , just holding onto their seats wo n't be enough for the @entity145			0
a big problem , of course , is that the last @entity9 primaries resulted in some extreme , combustible or un-electable @entity5 candidates , who have arguably cost the @entity9 five @entity5 seats over the past two cycles			1
that includes controversial comments about rape by rep. @entity155 of @entity156 and @entity158 treasurer @entity157 , who both lost their contests last week			0
" republicans openly acknowledge that they have a lot of soul searching to do right now			0
the party is at war with itself			0
even in more conservative areas of the country , voters reject the extremism and tea party ideology that has taken over the @entity9 , " suggests @entity128			2
the key for the @entity9 is if stronger , less controversial and more generally acceptable nominees emerge from their 2014 primary process			2
@entity175 on @entity176 " i think you can find common - sense conservative candidates who can appeal to primary and general election voters , " says another @entity9 strategist , adding this needs to come without the downside of those candidates saying some stupid things			1
for the @entity9 , the simple math of the next @entity5 means winning back the majority will be a tougher proposition in 2014 than it was this year			1
but @entity9 do have one thing in their favor : a midterm electorate			1
" if 2014 is similar to past midterm elections , the demographics of the people who turn out to vote will be very different from the electorate in the presidential elections of 2008 or 2012 , " says @entity1 polling director @entity192			2
" in midterms dating back to the 1990s , voters under the age of 30 represented 11 % -13 % of all voters , compared to 19 % this year			0
african - americans in past midterms have represented 9 % -11 % of all voters , compared to 13 % in 2012			0
so if history is any guide , the 2014 midterm electorate will be older and a bit whiter than this year , which could easily benefit @entity9 candidates , " adds @entity192			1
just like last cycle , we may not have to wait until @entity122 for the first @entity5 contest of 2014 and if that 's the case , we 'll have @entity213 to thank			1
the 2009 death of @entity62 sen. @entity215 forced a january 2010 special election , which @entity9 state sen. @entity217 won , in an upset			2
if @entity213 ' senior senator , @entity221 chairman @entity220 , is nominated as @entity98 's defense secretary or secretary of state for his second term , there would be another special election in that state			2
and that could provide an opening for @entity217 , who was just defeated last week , to make a comeback			0
moderate @entity15 eye midterms warily			0

the race for the 2014 @entity5 is already starting
@entity15 actually gained at least one @entity5 seat in last week 's election
@entity9 have one thing in their favor in 2014 - a midterm electorate
