-- months after he told off a passenger over a plane 's public address system , a former @entity2 flight attendant told @entity0 's @entity6 on tuesday that " a perfect storm of bad manners " triggered his much ballyhooed outburst			1
" it was a stressful , rushed ( plane ) full of harried carriers ... and a harried crew , " @entity11 said in his first extensive interview since the august incident			1
" i was angry at all of it			0
i call it the perfect storm of bad manners that created this situation , including my own			0
" @entity23 talked to @entity0 exactly one week after reaching a deal with prosecutors and pleading guilty to second - degree attempted criminal mischief , a felony , and fourth - degree attempted criminal mischief , a misdemeanor			1
under terms of the deal , he must enter a yearlong mental health program , which includes treatment for substance abuse , and take certain medications			0
@entity23 must also pay a $ 10,000 fine to @entity2 for the cost of repairing or replacing the chute			1
that 's a steep cost given that @entity23 earned $ 9,700 last year after taking time off to help his ailing mother , said his publicist @entity41			1
but @entity23 said he was happy to avoid a trial that , as long as he is n't arrested again , keeps him out of jail			1
" i do n't look very good in horizontal stripes , " he said			0
@entity23 has signed with a book agent , through the @entity48 agency , to work with a co-writer on a story documenting his 20 years in the travel business			1
the book is tentatively titled " @entity53 , " @entity41 said			1
according to @entity23 , the incident occurred during the third and final leg of a day of flying for him and his crew , capping three straight days on the road and in the air			1
while on the ground in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity23 said his forehead got cut as he worked with a woman trying to wedge an oversized bag into an overhead bin			2
he said most of the brief @entity61 to @entity68 flight was largely uneventful , though some passengers later said he 'd been rude to them en route			0
@entity23 said tuesday , " i would n't deny that one bit			2
i 'm sure my service was less than stellar that day			0
" after the plane landed at @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity23 said the passenger with the large bag -- which had to be checked as it would n't fit in the overhead bin -- began berating him			1
with the @entity62 microphone already in hand , he said that he thanked the " respectful " passengers on board but not the woman who @entity23 said had called him a curse word			2
@entity23 said he then grabbed a few beers from the beverage cart , looked outside , opened the emergency evacuation slide and slid down			1
he described his thoughts at the time as a combination of " pure rage " and serenity and clarity that " i did n't need to do this anymore			0
" " i was just thinking , ' i 'm free , i 'm finally free , ' " he said			0
" it was a nice , hot beach day , and i had a couple of cold beers			0
" @entity23 hopped in his car and drove to his @entity100 , @entity68 , home , where police came and arrested him a few hours later			2
a self - described " recovering alcoholic , " @entity23 said he had " a few sips " of an alcoholic beverage while on the late - morning flight , but he denied he was drunk			1
almost hours after it became public , the episode became a national phenomenon			0
his " take this job and shove it " sentiment stirred support from hundreds of thousands of fans online , on talk radio , on late - night talk shows and elsewhere , as well as strong opinions about @entity23 , travel stress and the perceived growing rudeness of people			2
the son of an @entity120 pilot and flight attendant , @entity23 said that he 'd been a flight attendant for 20 years for @entity122 , @entity123 and ultimately @entity2 before that airline suspended him after this summer 's incident			1
being a flight attendant had changed significantly in that time , he claimed , becoming more stressful , less satisfying and less rewarding -- for people like himself as well as passengers			1
@entity23 said he was set to work a return flight for @entity130 before it crashed in july 1996 minutes after taking off from @entity68			1
he got counseling after that crash , which killed several friends , and after the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
" the days of the pillbox hat and the white gloves are long gone , " he said			0
" i think of myself as someone who reached the end of the rope and may not have handled it the best way ... but i 'm moving forward			0
" @entity23 himself says he was taken aback by the media frenzy and found humor in some of the potshots			2
" it 's surreal , it 's very strange , " he said			0
" i kind of remind myself that ( @entity11 ) has been a two - dimensional media , @entity150 - created figure			2
this is my chance to become a little more three - dimensional			0
