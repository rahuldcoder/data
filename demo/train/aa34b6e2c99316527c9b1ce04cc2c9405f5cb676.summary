-- " @entity5 " managed to enchant audiences and take flight opening weekend while @entity4 's sophomore effort , " @entity7 , " stumbled out of the gates			1
@entity9 's gothic fantasy , a @entity11 - rated re-imagining of the classic @entity13 villain starring @entity14 in the titular role , netted an estimated $ 70 million from 3,948 locations — $ 6.7 million of which was from the 347 @entity18 screens			1
boasting an @entity19 , the $ 180 million pic also brought in $ 100.6 million internationally from 47 territories ( 40 percent ahead of " @entity22 " ) , bringing its global cume to a mighty $ 170.6 million			1
it opens in @entity25 on june 20 and in @entity26 on july 4			2
" we 're feeling great , " @entity27 , @entity9 's distribution head told @entity0			1
" we came into the weekend thinking that we were going to do somewhere around $ 60 million and to end up with $ 70 million is a really encouraging start			2
" @entity0 : review of ' @entity5 ' as far as " @entity5 's " demographics go , 60 percent of audiences were female , 45 percent families , and 18 percent teens			1
on saturday , audiences were strong at all showings , from matinees to late night			2
" it feels like there 's some momentum and great word - of - mouth helping to propel the picture overall , " said @entity27			2
" it 's good to see that during the daytime you can be a really meaningful option to families			2
" but , the late - night business is key , too , he said			2
it shows that it appeals to a cross-section of demographics			2
he added : " it 's a nod to the draw of @entity14			2
she has had such extraordinary passion for this role			0
" @entity0 : @entity14 q&a - bringing malevolent ' @entity5 ' to life last weekend 's shiny new comic book movie , " x-men : @entity63 , " plummeted 64 percent in its second weekend with $ 32.6 million to take the no. 2 spot			1
most high - opening actioners are front - loaded , so this was n't unexpected , although it is on the higher end			1
second weekend falls have been all over the place in this seven - movie franchise			1
for comparison 's sake , " x-men : @entity75 " fell nearly 67 percent in weekend two , while @entity74 : @entity76 fell only 56 percent			1
but the @entity78 saga is doing just fine			0
the $ 200 million film has made an estimated $ 162 million domestically , and $ 500 million worldwide			1
@entity4 's " @entity7 " ( @entity82 ) did not fare so well , opening in third place with $ 17.1 million from 3,158 locations			1
that 's less than half of what @entity85 opened at in 2012 ( $ 54.4 million ) , and also below studio and analyst expectations , which assumed that the @entity90 comedy would at least break $ 20 million			0
in terms of the audience , 45 percent were female and 28 percent were under 25 for the raunchy r - rated pic. internationally , " @entity97 " opened in 21 territories and brought in $ 10.3 million , bringing its worldwide total to $ 27.4 million			1
westerns are historically a tricky genre to track , and combined with the fact that @entity102 is an untested lead ( as himself at least ) , this was much more of a wildcard than we initially assumed			0
but , the pic , which reportedly cost a modest $ 40 million to produce , could have legs amongst @entity102 's devotees in the long run			0
i would n't tell you otherwise , " @entity112 , @entity113 's president , @entity114 , told @entity0			1
" we would have hoped it would have been a little bit better , but it 's not a grave loss to the studio			0
" rounding out the top five are @entity122 and @entity124 's " @entity123 " and " blended " ( @entity122 as well )			0
the @entity125 brought in $ 12.23 million in its third weekend in theaters , bringing its domestic total to $ 174.66 million			0
finally , in weekend two , @entity129 's comedy " blended " managed to beat out neighbors ( now in its fourth weekend in theaters ) to take the fifth place spot with $ 8.43 million			1
the $ 40 million pic has made an estimated $ 29.63 million to date , domestically			0
here 's the top five : 1			0
@entity5 — $ 70 million ( domestic total : $ 70 million ) 2			0
x-men : @entity63 — $ 32.6 million ( domestic total : $ 162.1 million ) 3			1
