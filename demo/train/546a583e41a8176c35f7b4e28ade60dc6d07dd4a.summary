@entity0 , @entity1 -- the 33 workers trapped in a @entity1 mine got a rare treat tuesday night : they got to watch their national soccer team compete against @entity7 via a small projector wired down to their safety chamber on a fiber optic cable			1
@entity1 lost , 2 - 1			0
but it was a diversion , nonetheless , as the miners try to distract themselves while rescue crews continue drilling down to save them on day 34 of their ordeal			1
@entity17 , a spokeswoman for the @entity1 minerals ministry , told reporters wednesday that the drill being used in what 's called rescue @entity22 has driven through 28 more meters ( about 31 yards ) of earth since tuesday for a total distance of 141 meters ( 154 yards )			1
the @entity27 drill plunged 145 meters ( 158 yards ) more , to reach a total of 268 meters ( 293 yards ) , she said , and equipment for the @entity31 drill will begin arriving wednesday evening			0
@entity22 could take up to four months to reach the men , officials have said			0
the @entity27 operation could get to them in two months , while the @entity31 option -- which could turn out to be the fastest -- may not be ready to put into action until late september , authorities have said			0
the workers are trapped at a depth of 2,300 feet inside of a chamber in the mine			1
when rescuers first found them , the men told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter			2
by last week , their meals included bread with ham and turkey , wine cookies , stroganoff with pasta primavera , peaches in juice , nutritional supplements , bread with caramel spread , chicken in sauce and plantains			0
a team of experts from @entity69 held meetings with @entity1 officials tuesday to discuss the miners ' eventual extraction and their lives beyond that			1
dr. @entity76 , the deputy chief medical officer at @entity77 , said the @entity1 viewed the extraction of the miners as the end of the rescue operations			1
the @entity82 suggested that given the delicate recovery and re-integration of the miners , the actual rescue was just but a step in a longer process			1
for example , there is their re-introduction to their families and society , and the pressures they will feel from others and the media , he said			0
they will have to cope with a certain level of celebrity status for having survived in the mine , he added			2
@entity69 psychologist @entity101 , who was also a member of the @entity82 delegation , said that the miners were in great spirits			1
the fact that they had organized themselves into groups and established a hierarchy among themselves before being found in the mine was good for their mental well - being , he said			2
@entity101 said he shared with the @entity1 ideas about the importance of sleep and wake cycles and creating a systematic way of positioning lighting to that end			0
@entity1 health minister @entity120 told @entity2 the miners have been assigned tasks underground			2
the men have been divided into teams to manage the tubes that carry the supplies that are their lifeblood			0
one miner is in charge of setting the schedule of when they eat and sleep , another of nutritional matters and another of medical needs , he said			0
@entity2 's @entity136 in @entity0 contributed to this report .			2

the miners were able to watch a soccer match live via a projector
it 's been 34 days since they were trapped in the mine
@entity69 experts say their eventual rescue is only the first step in their recovery
