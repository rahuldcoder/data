-- in many ways , the @entity1 makes a strange -- and at times perilous -- hotbed for caricature			1
many of the region 's leaders have a poor reputation for humor , and often , the list of banned topics makes for a long read			2
for those that dare to satirize a taboo , the punishments can be harsh : arrest , torture , exile , even death			1
" the one thing a tyrant ca n't stand is to be laughed at , " says @entity20 , the executive director of the @entity21 , a group that monitors the threats facing editorial cartoonists globally			2
" if there 's rebellion in the streets , they can bring out the tanks , but if everyone is laughing at you , what defense do you have ? it undermines the authority of a tyrant to be laughed at			0
" despite the dangers that await many @entity42 cartoonists , some of the region 's more contentious countries are actually experiencing a political satire renaissance			1
according to @entity45 , a @entity47 - based @entity46 who is translating @entity50 's cartoons into @entity51 for his blog , @entity53 , the country is experiencing " a golden age of caricature			1
" " on any given day , a newspaper could have ten comics			0
you 'll see dozens of @entity61 above the @entity63 fold being mocked , " he says , referring to the ousted @entity50 president			1
" you just would n't see that in @entity67 papers			0
" video : the artist that sculpted @entity71 still , he notes , the country 's media is more reticent about publishing images critical of the military			0
" a couple of artists told me they got warning calls from the military , but more as a kind of gentle , backroom nudge , " he explains			0
in other countries , the nudges are less gentle			2
the assault of @entity86 cartoonist @entity85 in 2011 brought international attention to the dangers awaiting those that -- pen and ink in hand -- poke fun at the @entity42 world 's more tyrannical leaders			1
for much of his career , @entity85 satirized the political and military order in @entity99 without singling out any individual			1
in the months leading up to the @entity86 revolution , he broke what he called " the barrier of fear " and started drawing president @entity103			1
in one daring image , the @entity86 ruler was depicted standing on the side of the road , thumbing for a lift from deposed ( and , at the time , living ) @entity113 dictator @entity112			1

" the president 's boot is better than you , " they told him , before breaking every finger in his hands and leaving him for dead			0
" at that moment , i thought that i was going to say good - bye to life			1
but i also thought i had to accept the outcome of what i 'd done			2
i had to stand behind what i believed in , " admits @entity85 , who was recently in @entity132 for an exhibition of @entity86 art organized by the charity @entity99 , who is using proceeds from the sales to fund their relief work			1
hands healed , @entity85 continues to draw politically charged cartoons , but now lives outside @entity99			2
if he was ever reticent about caricaturing the atrocities taking place in his home country , he is n't now			0
" i was really happy to start drawing again			0
it was like a second chance			0
after what happened to me , i had more resolve to tell the whole world			0
i went to the front line			0
it 's been even more important for me to speak out against the regime , " he says			0
video : @entity50 's first comedy factory though exile is not an easy life , those cartoonists that have n't managed to escape face a potentially worse fate			1
last year , another @entity86 artist , @entity162 , was arrested and has n't been heard from since			2
@entity20 , who has been lobbying for @entity162 's release , fears he may be dead			0
" we sent a letter to @entity86 ambassador in @entity167 , @entity168 , and a few days later heard his trial had been delayed			2
we thought , ' oh , how wonderful			0
' two weeks later , we heard he 'd been killed , " he says			0
recognizing the dangers that many cartoonists face , @entity115 @entity172 who fled @entity115 in 2003 , is working on an online platform that allows cartoonists to use templates to create their own satires anonymously			1
" that way , people can use those characters to question the authorities , without having it traced back to , say , the @entity86 or @entity115 cyber army , " he says			1
" it 's our way of giving a voice to the voiceless			0

some countries in the @entity1 , like @entity50 , are experiencing a ' golden age ' of caricature .
many cartoonists in the region can face arrest , torture and exile .
@entity86 cartoonist @entity85 thought he 'd say ' good - bye to life ' when assaulted by thugs in 2011 .
