a " bunch of twats " on friday			2
the 31 - year - old took to @entity15 to refute the findings of an @entity10 disciplinary panel which cast " considerable doubt " over evidence he gave in defense of former @entity3 captain @entity21 , who was found guilty last month of racially abusing @entity23 defender @entity22			1
@entity22 is the brother of @entity26 star @entity25 , whose comments about former @entity3 colleague @entity2 and strained relations with onetime defensive partner @entity21 have contributed to what one leading football official has described as a " ' mafia feud "			1
' @entity33 , well done # fa i lied did i , # @entity35 , ' @entity2 tweeted , so courting a possible misconduct charge himself from the very organization he was criticizing			0
@entity2 , who is set to join up with the @entity3 squad after the weekend for two forthcoming @entity40 qualifiers , has since deleted the tweet that was re-tweeted over 19,000 times and apologized for his remarks			1
" i had just finished training and saw the captions on the tv screens in the treatment rooms about what was said in the @entity52 ruling about me , " a statement issued by the player declared			0
" i was really upset and tweeted my feelings in the heat of the moment			0
i apologize unreservedly for my comment about the @entity10			0
" @entity2 was responding to the @entity10 's publication on friday of a 63 - page report which questioned the truth of statements given by himself , @entity21 and @entity1 club secretary @entity62 about a @entity64 game at @entity23 in october 2011 -- with the commission describing @entity21 's defense as " improbable , implausible and contrived			1
" stripped of the @entity3 captaincy in february by the @entity10 in relation to an incident which has since seen him retire from international football , @entity21 has until 18 october to decide whether to appeal his four - game suspension and us $ 350,000 fine			1
during a game which @entity1 lost 1 - 0 , following the dismissal of two players from the current @entity78 champions , @entity21 has admitted to calling @entity22 a " f * * * * * * black c * * * " in the closing moments			2
the defense for his comments was based on the claim he was repeating words @entity22 had said to him , with the @entity1 captain saying he was asking his fellow defender if he believed he had been on the end of racial abuse			0
" we are driven to conclude not just that it is ' highly unlikely ' that mr. @entity22 accused mr. @entity21 on the pitch of calling him a ' black c * * * ' , but that he did not , " the @entity10 commission wrote			2
" a much more plausible and likely explanation is that mr. @entity21 was angry ; angry at mr. @entity22 's taunting and provocation of him , angry at the way the match had gone , and angry at the way in which it seemed likely to end			0
" the much more likely explanation for what he said is that all of this provoked him into saying ' f * * * ing black c * * * ' as an insult , which is consistent with the fact that insults preceded and followed those words			0
" @entity111 is entitled to use its collective experience of life and people to judge demeanor			0
" we have watched the film footage many times			0
in the critical phase , during which he uses the words ' f * * * ing black c * * * ' , mr. @entity21 can be seen to be smiling initially , before his facial expression changes to disdainful and contemptuous			0
" at no point is his demeanor and facial expression that of someone who is imploring , injured , or even quizzical in the face of an unfounded allegation by mr. @entity22 that he ( mr. @entity21 ) had just been racially abusive towards him ( mr. @entity22 )			0
" @entity21 was cleared in a magistrates ' court in july of racially abusing @entity22 but the @entity10 found him guilty on 27 september , using the " balance of probabilities " as its standard of proof as opposed to the " beyond reasonable doubt " ruling used in a criminal trial			2
the organization stressed that it does not believe " @entity21 to be a racist " , citing a large body of testimonial evidence -- " including statements from black footballers " -- to say that he is not , but that it did find the controversy - plagued 31 - year - old guilty of making a racist insult			0
the @entity10 also stated that it had " considerable doubt " over @entity2 's claims that he had heard @entity22 use the word " black " when insulting @entity21 after the pair clashed late on			1
the initial evidence given by @entity2 in the days after the game was amended in november 2011 when @entity1 secretary @entity62 asked the @entity10 to add the word " black " to the left back 's original statement			1
nearly one year on , the @entity10 panel found @entity62 's evidence to be " materially defective			1
" it went on : " @entity111 [ has ] considerable doubt as to whether the request to amend paragraph 4 of mr. @entity2 's statement , to include the word ' black ' , was based on mr. @entity2 's own personal recollections , or as a result of discussions that he had had with mr. @entity62			2
" the document also found fault with @entity2 's claims since it believes abusive comments made by @entity22 himself towards @entity21 -- which the @entity23 defender says were in relation to a perceived marital affair by the @entity1 man with a former team mate 's ex-girlfriend -- were of a sexual rather than racial nature			1
some observers have queried the leniency of @entity21 's ban , half that given to @entity180 's @entity179 after he repeatedly racially abused @entity26 's @entity181 last year , and the @entity10 report states that the @entity1 captain 's punishment took light of the fact that his " racist insult was issued only once "			1
even should @entity21 decide against appealing his ban and fine , @entity2 's outburst will means that an ongoing stain on the @entity9 game --- namely , the continuing focus on racism in the self - proclaimed " best league in the world " --- looks set to continue for some time .			1
