@entity0 -- international golfers were choking on the greens in @entity4 over the weekend -- but it was n't due to an outbreak of the yips			1
hazardous levels of pollution descended on the @entity11 capital during its biggest sporting weekend of the year so far , affecting competitors and spectators alike at an @entity17 golf event and the @entity19 tennis championship , which boasted such big names as @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23			1
the sight of golfers wearing surgical - style face masks at the @entity27 was hardly the advertisement that the sport was seeking for the first @entity17 event to be held in @entity11			1
play was delayed for several hours sunday to attempt to give the smog time to clear , before players including @entity35 's @entity34 and @entity37 's @entity36 took to the fairways donning masks			1
spectators at tennis ' @entity19 , where @entity21 triumphed in the men 's final and @entity23 in the women 's , were also photographed wearing protective face masks			1
the pollution levels -- which saw visibility drop to less than 500 meters at times , according to @entity11 's @entity49 , and prompted the @entity51 embassy to advise its citizens to stay indoors and run air purifiers -- has led to questions being raised of the viability of international sporting fixtures in the northern @entity11 city , or at least their continued ability to draw big names			1
@entity61 doubles player @entity60 remarked about the dire conditions in his blog , labeling the air quality " a disaster " and " a joke			1
" " how much of your life disappears when you spend time here ? " he wrote			0
" already after a few days i feel that i am not doing ( too ) good			0
i get dizzy when i get up			0
yesterday i could n't recover between points in practice and was breathing heavily the whole hour			0
if you blow your nose in the evening , the paper turns black			0
it 's just not healthy to be here			2
i should probably think about that next year			0
" @entity77 , director of @entity78 , a company that organizes sports events in @entity80 , said it was unlikely @entity4 would be able to continue to attract big names at sporting events unless pollution issues were addressed			1
" @entity4 will always have big sporting events because they 'll get the sponsorship and support from local government			2
but in terms of the caliber of the athletes -- the top athletes will have concerns about coming to @entity4			2
regardless of their prize money and the lucrative offers they 'll get to participate -- they 'll have doubts about whether it will affect their health in the long term			0
if it does , is it worth coming ? " read also : @entity21 beats new no. 1 @entity22 to retain @entity19 title @entity60 is not the first athlete to raise concerns about competing in @entity4 's smog			1
in 2008 , reigning marathon world record holder @entity106 refused to contest the event at the @entity109 due to fears of the impact on his asthma , saying to do so would be " committing suicide			2
" a year earlier , the women 's tennis number one @entity114 pulled out of the @entity19 in the city for the same reason , while in 2011 , organizers at the event were forced to turn on floodlights in the afternoon to allow play to continue amid the heavy smog			1
@entity77 , whose firm organized the @entity124 up a skyscraper in august , said the capital 's pollution levels were a particular concern for potential participants in running events in the city , and were among the reasons why the city 's marathon , to be held later this month , would likely struggle to attract top - tier talent			1
" when it comes to runners , pollution in the air really affects their performance			0
we have to advise them to actually just stay at the hotel and train in the gym , " he said			0
" there are times when i 've stayed at hotels in @entity4 and have n't been able to see out the window			2
" the pollution issue meant the company had to give " serious thought " to running any sports events in the city			0
" as an event organizer safety is our first priority , " he said			1
" even if you have a few serious incidents where people have to go to hospital because of the pollution , then that makes it not worth doing			0
" the smog , which also grounded a number of international flights out of the capital , came at the end of @entity11 's october 1 - 7 " @entity171 " holiday , a peak travel time for @entity11 families to travel			2
six major highways were closed sunday , exacerbating the problem			0
@entity21 acknowledged the pollution issue after the event , saying it was less than ideal , but that players knew what they were dealing with			2
the @entity27 was won by one shot by @entity11 's @entity180 , in her second career victory .			0
