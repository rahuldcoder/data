-- three human heads and three decapitated bodies with notes aimed at high government officials were found thursday in different parts of @entity8 's capital , national police said			1
the notes were addressed to interior minister @entity10 and @entity11 , the nation 's director of prisons			1
one of the notes said the officials must impose order in the nation 's prisons or these atrocities would continue , police said			1
the other said that impunity against lawlessness must end , according to police			2
the heads were inside plastic bags , one of them in front of the main doors to the @entity31 in @entity32 , police said			1
" that 's obviously a first for @entity8 , " said @entity33 , an expert on @entity35 gangs and founding editor of the @entity38 intelligence report			1
" that 's something we 've seen the @entity42 ( drug cartel ) do in @entity44			2
" @entity47 , a spokesman for the national police , attributed the slayings to the @entity42 or another narcotrafficking group , the @entity46 newspaper reported			1
@entity47 did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment			2
@entity33 did not discount the possibility that anti-crime vigilantes could have been responsible			2
" it could also be death squads , " he said			2
" off - duty police officers or other types hired by local businessmen who say , ' go after the street gangs			2
' " there 's a lot of moving parts to this story , " said @entity33 , who recently wrote a book on the @entity63 gang of @entity64 and is working on a book about the @entity42 , which has emerged as @entity44 's most ruthless drug cartel			0
@entity33 said in an interview last year that there are two main criminal elements in @entity8 : drug cartels that deal in large - scale exportation and street gangs that sell drugs at the retail level and are involved in other crimes , such as robbery and extortion			1
in some cases , they work together			0
when those criminals get arrested , they continue their activities inside prison , said @entity88 , director of the @entity89 in @entity32			1
" the prisons , in general , are centers of corruption , " @entity90 said last year			1
" from inside prison , they direct kidnappings , extortion , drug trafficking			0
" prison officials are often targeted for violence			1
in september , three coordinated attacks killed four prison officials in a five - hour span			2
left dead were a prison assistant director , a warden and two guards			0
one guard and a shooting suspect were wounded , as were three citizens			0
one of the wounded was a woman in the eighth month of pregnancy , news accounts said			0
at least three prison guards have been killed and five wounded in five attacks this year , published reports say			0
@entity33 said that all of @entity64 is under attack from organized crime cartels , because the region is pinched between @entity121 and @entity44 , the two biggest sources of drugs in the area			0
@entity126 interdiction efforts that have targeted the flow of drugs through the @entity128 also have forced cartels to travel through the @entity89 isthmus , @entity33 said			0
within @entity64 , he said , @entity8 , @entity131 and @entity132 have the worst problems			1
among those three nations , @entity8 stands out			1
" when you talk about a country being hollowed out by organized crime , @entity8 is at the top of the list , " @entity33 said			1
there are two main reasons , he said : geography and an incompetent and corrupt government			0
" @entity8 bunches right up against @entity44 , " @entity33 said			1
" any spillover effect is almost certainly going south			0
" said @entity145 , a @entity64 analyst with the @entity147 consulting firm , " the narcos are coming down from @entity44			2
" in addition , @entity33 said , the federal government is not able to control large segments of the country			0
for example , @entity154 state in northern @entity8 , bordered on two sides by @entity44 , is lawless , he said			1
@entity145 made the same point in an interview last year			0
" the narcos control about 40 percent of the territory down there , which is pretty amazing , " she said			0
@entity145 also pointed out that the @entity8 government reduced anti-crime spending in the 2010 budget because of the nation 's dire economic situation			1
" if you do n't have resources , you ca n't pay for troops and supplies and intelligence , " she said			0
