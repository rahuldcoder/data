-- with the @entity2 set to hear oral arguments about the constitutionality of the president @entity6 's health care law , more patients than ever have been asking for my thoughts about health reform			1
i practice primary care in southern @entity11 near the @entity13 border , which gives me a firsthand look at how health reform has impacted my neighboring state			1
despite flaws with the @entity13 approach , and the president 's @entity19 which is modeled after it , i believe that health care reform needs to move forward			1
read a transcript of monday 's court arguments over the years , i have encountered too many cases of patients who are inadequately served by our current health care model			1
some of their stories are heartbreaking , others are deeply worrisome			0
some time ago , i had one middle - aged patient with diabetes , whom i 'll call @entity35 , requiring high doses of insulin to control his blood sugar			0
he faithfully saw me every three months , where i made careful insulin adjustments so his sugars would n't go too high or low			0
but all of a sudden , he stopped coming			0
i did n't hear from him until a year later , when i received a call from the emergency department telling me @entity35 was found in a coma because of a critically high sugar level			2
thankfully , he survived his hospital stay , and when he came for a visit afterward he explained how he had lost his job , and thus , his health insurance			2
he could n't afford to see me or buy his medication			0
according to the 2010 @entity53 survey , 72 % of jobless @entity51 said they could n't afford to fill a prescription or obtain needed medical tests			0
worse , 40 % said that medical bills forced them into difficult financial decisions , such as depleting their savings , or being unable to pay for necessities like food , heat or rent			0
these are choices patients should never be forced to make			0
but it 's not only patients without insurance who suffer			0
others are in a situation like another patient of mine , whom i 'll call @entity75			0
she recently told me that her sister was diagnosed with colon cancer , a disease with a strong genetic component			0
i recommended that @entity75 have a colonoscopy			0
unfortunately , her health insurance plan had a deductible in the thousands of dollars , making a colonoscopy prohibitively expensive			0
last year , a study from the @entity86 , a nonprofit , nonpartisan research organization , found that families enrolled in high - deductible plans like @entity75 's cut back on health care that was clearly beneficial , like cervical cancer , breast cancer and colon cancer screening			1
according to the study , " these cutbacks could cause a spike in health care costs down the road if people end up sicker and need more intensive treatment			1
" the @entity19 would help patients like @entity35 , by providing him a way to obtain affordable health insurance regardless of his job status			1
beginning in 2014 , health reform would expand the eligibility of @entity109 and provide federal tax credits to help buy private insurance			1
on average , 17 % of the nonelderly population nationwide would be helped , with numbers as high as 36 to 40 % in parts of @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
and for patients like @entity75 , health reform would prohibit cost sharing for many preventive screening tests , including colonoscopies			1
my support of the @entity19 is tempered , however , by a serious flaw : its benefits can not be fully realized without a strong primary care foundation			1
in the @entity51 , the number of specialists to primary care doctors is about 70 - 30 , a ratio that 's reversed in the rest of the world			1
that primary care deficit is a far bigger threat to health reform than if the @entity2 were to rule president @entity6 's law unconstitutional			1
having health insurance does n't necessarily mean that you 'll be able to see a doctor			0
in @entity13 , more than 95 % of residents have health insurance , the highest in the country			0
however , a 2011 @entity148 survey found that more than half of primary care doctors were not accepting new patients , while the average wait time for an appointment exceeded one month			1
when you consider that health coverage will expand to 32 million @entity51 in 2014 , whether our strained primary care system can handle that burden is a serious question			1
an inability to see a primary care provider will force patients to already crowded emergency departments , where health care is often the most expensive			1
the @entity19 does n't do nearly enough to make primary care enticing , despite the anticipated shortfall of primary care providers approaching 30,000 by 2015			1
medical students , concerned by their average school debt approaching $ 160,000 , often eschew primary care in favor higher paying specialties			2
and the bureaucratic burdens of primary care , including paperwork and spending time on the telephone refuting insurance company denials , are overwhelming			2
according to an @entity180 study , 30 % of primary care doctors considered leaving the field entirely , citing burnout , time pressures and administrative hassles			2
these concerns , however , should n't stall health reform			2
instead , they need to be addressed as the @entity19 is modified and improved on in the coming years			2
far too many patients can no longer afford to obtain basic care			2
it 's their stories that have made me realize we desperately need to fix our broken health care system , and accept health reform despite its shortcomings			1
we can not let the pursuit of perfection become the enemy of doing the right thing			0
patients like @entity35 and @entity75 need help now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity2 will hear arguments about the constitutionality of the health care law
@entity205 : despite flaws , we should go forward with the @entity19
he says current health care system does not adequately address needs of patients
pho : health reform is necessary , but we also need a strong primary care foundation
