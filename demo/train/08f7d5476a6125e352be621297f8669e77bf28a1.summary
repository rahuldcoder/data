" he said everyone needs to know they are of value and respected , and by saying , ' gay is good , ' he thought that reflected that feeling			0
he wanted dignity and self - respect , and that 's what he fought for , " according to @entity14 of the @entity15			0
@entity2 died peacefully of natural causes , according to his sister @entity17			1
he was at a @entity20 dinner a week ago in a wheelchair , she said			0
" @entity2 led an extraordinary life marked by heroic activism that set a path for the modern @entity28 civil rights movement , " @entity20 president @entity22 said in a statement			2
" from his early days fighting institutionalized discrimination in the federal workforce , dr. @entity2 taught us all that ' gay is good			0
' " as we say goodbye to this trailblazer on @entity34 , we remember the remarkable power we all have to change the world by living our lives like @entity2 -- openly , honestly and authentically , " said @entity22 , whose group works for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights			0
a seat at the front of the audience was reserved for @entity2 when president @entity45 in december 2010 signed into law the repeal of " @entity48 , " which banned gay men and lesbians from serving openly in the @entity52 armed forces			0

@entity2 called upon the nascent gay rights movement to model itself upon the civil rights movement			1
the homophile movement , as it was called at the time , said that homosexuals were triply condemned : the medical establishment deemed them mentally ill , the law made them criminals and religions branded them sinners			1
at a time when lesbians and gay men were so ostracized , the homophile movement decided its best tactic was to embrace the label of sickness : at least that seemed a half - step up from being criminals			2
but @entity2 argued that such an approach was counterproductive , and that gay people should demand equality with heterosexuals			2
to gain equality , he argued , the movement needed to assert itself			2
@entity2 led the way in tactics such as public demonstrations , went on the attack against the @entity102 for its policy of firing homosexuals , and spearheaded an effort to get the homophile movement to take the position that homosexuality was not only not a mental illness but was on a par with heterosexuality			1
