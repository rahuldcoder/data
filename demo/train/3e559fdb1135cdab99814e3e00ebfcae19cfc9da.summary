@entity0 -- @entity3 's widow on tuesday questioned the findings of @entity6 scientists that the @entity8 leader did not die from radioactive polonium poisoning but rather from natural causes			1
the conclusion , leaked to multiple @entity6 media agencies and @entity13 , contradicts the findings of @entity16 forensic scientists who concluded last month that samples taken from @entity3 's exhumed body were consistent with polonium - 210 exposure but did not definitely prove that he was poisoned			1
" i 'm convinced there is something wrong , and he did not die from a natural death , " @entity21 said at a news conference in @entity0			1
she said she is requesting that the @entity16 findings be made available to @entity6 authorities investigating her husband 's death			1
she said the medical experts in @entity16 and @entity6 came from different medical fields			1
" i do n't doubt them			0
but they are different skills			0
they are different types of medicines , " she said			0
the @entity6 findings will do little to quell the rumors that @entity3 was poisoned			1
@entity3 died at age 75 at a @entity0 military hospital in november 2004 after he had a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma			2
@entity8 officials said in the days before his death that @entity3 had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems			1
rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but @entity8 officials denied them			0
two weeks after @entity3 's death , his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death			1
@entity58 , who was the @entity8 observer to the @entity59 , said toxicology tests showed " no known poison , " though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle 's death			0
polonium - 210 made headlines in 2006 , when it was used to kill @entity68 , a former @entity69 agent who came to @entity70 in 2000 after turning whistle - blower on the @entity72 , the @entity69 's successor			1
in a deathbed statement from a @entity76 hospital , @entity68 blamed @entity78 's president @entity77 , an accusation the @entity80 strongly denied			0
palestinians who view @entity3 as a symbol of resistance are also quite emotional about the suspicion he was poisoned			1
@entity3 first led the @entity84 , which carried out attacks against @entity87 targets , and then served as the leader of the quasi-governmental @entity89 after parts of the @entity91 and @entity92 were returned to @entity8 control			2
he was considered one of the pioneers of what became known as " television terrorism , " high - profile attacks that targeted @entity87 and made for big television stories			0
@entity3 won the @entity100 in 1994 , along with @entity87 leaders @entity102 and @entity103 , for their work on the @entity106 accords in 1993			2
the @entity106 agreement was perceived at the time as a breakthrough that could lead to an independent @entity8 state and a permanent peace with @entity87			0
but in 2000 , @entity3 rejected an @entity87 peace deal based on the @entity106 deal			2
that led to a @entity8 uprising that lasted more than four years			0
@entity87 -- in retaliation for increased terror attacks on @entity87 -- severely restricted @entity3 's movements , confining him to his @entity91 compound in @entity119 in december 2001			2
@entity120 reported from @entity0 , and @entity121 wrote and reported from @entity122 .			0

" he did not die from a natural death , " @entity21 said tuesday
she says the findings by @entity6 scientists contract those of @entity16 scientists
the @entity6 findings conclude @entity3 was not poisoned with polonium - 210
last month , @entity16 scientists said there was evidence of polonium in samples
