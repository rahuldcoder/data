, child - free workers are pitted against those who are parents , haggling over who does more work			1
certainly , the tensions are real			0
but what this article and much popular debate around flextime misses is that when appropriately implemented , co-workers benefit from the greater contributions , not to mention healthier lifestyles , that flextime affords			2
it 's time to move beyond overly simplistic analysis that sets people against each other at work			2
as an executive coach , adviser and confidante to senior executives across many industries , i 've been working with this issue for more than 15 years and have heard all sides			1
those without children will find many reasons to complain about work , including having to pick up slack for colleagues with children			2
but the reverse is true , too : while working parents are worrying about getting to their kids ' activities , they complain about the preoccupation their child - free colleagues have with dating , their frequenting of happy hours , their unavailability to answer calls at night while they are out socializing and the unproductive mornings that follow as they try to shake their hangovers			1
in my experience , much of the tension among employees with children and those without children is caused by varying levels of availability			1
who would think that parents with children are often more accessible and more reliable than those without ? on a recent friday at 5:15 p.m. , i went to meet a friend at her @entity70 office , where she works as a psychologist at the @entity72			1
the office was practically empty			0
she and her colleague were the only therapists , out of 30 , who were there after 5 p.m. they are among the few therapists on staff with toddlers at home			0
just the night before , i met a client in @entity83 for dinner , a senior executive at @entity86 , no kids			0
she told me that she was taking this friday off to spend more time with her parents in their country home			1
these are not the scenarios that generally come to mind when you think of stereotypical workers with and without children			1
that is because the flextime issue has long been framed as a zero sum game in which those with kids win and those without kids lose			1
this relies on old - school ways of thinking about how work gets done			0
if face time were the only measure of contributions in the workplace , then perhaps it would seem that child - free workers were left holding the bag			1
efficiency trumps face time almost every time in white collar jobs , and even a good portion of blue collar jobs			1
the majority of senior managers i have worked with tell me that parents learn time and people management skills that make them more effective managers at work			2
because there is more at stake when one 's paycheck is providing for many rather than one , there is a sense of urgency in keeping a job and being promoted rather than a sense of entitlement about perks and promotion			0
what the problem often comes down to is superficial appearances : it may look like working parents are getting a slide when they leave to take care of the family			1
and that is because working parents and child - free workers alike assume we need to disclose more than we really do			1
in these matters transparency is overrated			0
my recommendation is simple : do n't ask , do n't tell			2
when a worker has to leave the office , he or she should simply state , " i have to leave at x time because i have an event / appointment / commitment			0
" the caveat here is that this only works for jobs that do n't require physical presence in a particular location , in office cultures in which total contribution is measured and in workplaces in which employees are present and available to take calls 90 % of the time between 9 - 5 and often beyond			1
ultimately every company wants employees who look in the mirror each morning and ask , " am i working as smart as i can ? " at companies such as @entity179 , a global design company , they 've refined this model			2
on a tour of the company this summer , i learned that a typical new project launch commences with each team member describing their ideal work schedule , and the whole team is expected to morph into a schedule that goes partway to meet everyone 's scheduling needs			0
not only is this a successful model , but company 's managers tells me they find that employees are more productive when they work out their customized schedules			0
they also remain at the company longer , accept lower compensation because of the benefits in work / life balance and have reduced tension with co-workers around issues of fairness in team contributions			0
similarly , employees at the @entity208 web - app company 37 signals are part of a results - focused and mostly virtual environment in which each person determines his or her schedule with consideration to teammates needs and is judged by the results			0
whether it 's toddlers or happy hours that motivate a worker 's desire to work more flexibly , the reasons do n't matter as long as the worker gets the job done			0
if we do n't start taking a more enlightened and complex view when it comes to our feelings about co-workers , the conversation around flextime will quickly descend into blame and resentment , which ultimately affects not only morale and culture but also the bottom line			1
we need to flex our minds when we think about who partakes , who loses and who gains from workplace attitudes that allow for making judgments about co-workers not only at work but outside of work , too			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity249 .			2

@entity249 : @entity251 *reports* tension between workers with children and those without
she says it should n't be so ; workplaces that value contribution over face time do better
she says working parents often more efficient ; *nonparents* go out , sometimes not available
@entity266 : companies ' with enlightened view about flextime , remove *resnetment* as an issue
