-- @entity2 ' decision to star in " @entity3 " was a risk that paid off			1
when the 39 - year - old actress first spotted the script for @entity9 's ' 60s - era drama , her interest was piqued			2
but while she was all in to play @entity11 , the sharp and curvacious secretary who would rise to become an integral member of " @entity3 's " world , @entity2 ' agency was n't so sure			1
" they said , ' it 's a period piece , it 's never going to go anywhere , " the actress told @entity15 paper @entity14			0
" ' we need you to make money and this is n't going to make money			0
' " the agency , she continued , " ended up dropping me			2
" but to @entity2 , the promise of " @entity3 " outweighed the potential for failure			1
" i had been on several shows that were meant to be the big ones , that would go on for ever , and they did n't , " she pointed out			0
" so there was no sure bet and i 'd already taken a chance on them and i felt , why not do the one you 're in love with and take a chance on that ? " taking that chance has led to a breakthrough role for the actress , who until " @entity3 " had done a few appearances on tv series " @entity48 , " " @entity49 " and " @entity50			1
" but after stepping into @entity11 's shoes , and earning five emmy nominations along the way , @entity2 ' popularity has soared			1
the treatment she receives now from the public is a far cry from what she suffered in high school , where @entity2 said she was bullied			1
" we had a locker bay , and every time i went down there to get books out of my locker people would sit on top and spit at me , " @entity2 told @entity14			2
" so i had to have my locker moved because i could n't go in there ... i felt scared in high school			1
it was like ' @entity73			0
' there was always some kid getting pummeled and people cheering			0
" at this point , she could attend her high school reunion just to have the last laugh , but @entity2 said that she has n't held on to any bitterness about those days			1
" you know , i had so much anger about that time , that experience , for so long and i do n't know what dissipated it , but now it 's gone , " @entity2 said			2
" i feel some sadness about it , about how cruel kids can be to each other , but that 's it			0
... i have n't gone to any reunions			0
i 'm sure , if i did , they would have no idea i went there			0

@entity2 was dropped by her agency over " @entity3 "
but the risk paid off , as the series has earned her five @entity104 nods
she was also bullied in high school
