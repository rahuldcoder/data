-- when @entity2 went to bed on a summer night in 2008 , she was an ordinary administrative assistant living in a modest one - bedroom condo just outside @entity5 but a few hours later , when a persistent ringing phone woke her up in the dead of the august night , the 55 - year - old found out she was much more than simply a secretary			1
at the other end of the line was @entity2 's cousin , from @entity13 , a small fishing village on the coast of @entity16			1
excited and humble , he congratulated her on being the new king of @entity13			1
" i said , ' listen , it 's 4 o'clock in the morning in the @entity19 , i am very tired , let me sleep , ' " remembers @entity2			1
" i thought he was trying to really play games with me			0
" but this was no time for games			0
the previous king of @entity13 , who was @entity2 's uncle , had just died			1
the village elders , who remembered @entity2 from the times she 'd visited with her mother , had decided to anoint her as their new ruler			1
watch video : @entity2 shows off her crowns after the initial shock , @entity2 decided to accept the kingship			2
over the course of a few days , she went from being plain old @entity2 , who had worked for nearly three decades at the @entity36 in the @entity19 , to becoming @entity2 -- the first female king of @entity13 , reigning over approximately 7,000 people			1
" it never ever occurred to me [ that i 'd be @entity13 's king ] , " says @entity2 , who 's been living in the @entity19 since her early 20s			1
" i realized that on this earth , we all have a calling			0
we have to be ready to accept it because helping my people has really helped me a lot to know that i can really touch their lives , " she adds			0
" i would have really regretted it if i had n't really accept this calling			0
" although she still works at the @entity16 embassy , @entity2 uses all her holiday every year to spend a month in @entity52			1
@entity2 is the traditional title of @entity13 's ruler , and @entity2 says she 's happy to be called a king , rather than queen , because it means she can achieve more			1
" most of the time , a king is the one who has all the executive power to do things , while the queen is mostly in charge of the children 's affairs and reporting to the king , " she says			0
" so i really love this			0
" read more : the @entity2 of @entity13 @entity2 was born in @entity68 , southern @entity16 , in 1953			1
she studied in @entity70 before moving to the @entity19 , where she became an @entity19 citizen in 1997			2
but after inheriting the throne , @entity2 has been living two very different lives in two different continents			2
in @entity5 , her secretarial duties include typing letters , answering phone calls and booking appointments			0
in her little apartment her life is far removed from the luxuries of her royal roots			2
" when i am in the @entity19 i do everything by myself , " she explains			2
" i do my own laundry , i do my own cooking , i do my own driving and i do my own bed when i wake up in the morning			0
" read more : secretary is still the top job for women but back in @entity16 , she stands out as a gold crown - wearing , scepter - holding king who lives in a refurbished palace			1
@entity13 residents usually address her as " nana " -- an honorary title given to royalty but also to women with grandchildren -- and bow when they see her			2
" when i am back home they see me as their king and they want to pamper me , " she says			2
" they have to cook for me , they have to carry me around and they have to protect me from people			0
they want to do everything for me which i usually refuse ... sometimes i say to them ' please , do n't bow			0
' i just want them to be free and comfortable so that way we can really address issues			0
" in pictures : @entity118 's power women but beyond the bows , the royal attire and certain luxuries that come with her title , being a king in an impoverished place like @entity13 is all about dealing with the pressing needs of the community and improving the lives of the people , says @entity2			1
" to be a king in an @entity118 village or some places like this , it 's not like @entity136 queens where everything is on a silver platter for them , " she says			2
" i have to really work hard to help my people			0
i have to give myself to people to better their lives			0
" in the last few years , she 's helped poor families pay school fees for their children and brought computers to classrooms			0
with the help of other @entity19 she 's also provided @entity13 with its first ambulance , as well as access to clean , running water			1
her next priority , she says , is to bring state - of - the - art toilets to @entity13			2
and even when she 's not in @entity16 , her royal duties do not stop ; she wakes up at 1am every morning to call @entity13 and be informed about what 's happening in the community			1
" i talk to my regent , i talk to my elders , " @entity2 says			0
" if there is something that i want to know , they tell me			0
if there is something that i want them to do , i tell them			0
" last year , @entity2 's real - life fairy tale was documented in a book written by her and author @entity169			1
and now she says her amazing life journey from secretary to king will be told in a film , after @entity175 star @entity174 bought the rights to the book			1
" next year , @entity178 willing , we are going to have a movie out there , " says @entity2			1
" @entity181 is going to play me and i 'm so happy to at least let the whole world know that a secretary can become a king and lead wisely and help the people			0

for more than *30* years , @entity2 has worked as a secretary in the @entity19
but then one day a phone call took her back to her @entity16 roots
she was chosen to be the king of @entity13 , a fishing village in @entity16
