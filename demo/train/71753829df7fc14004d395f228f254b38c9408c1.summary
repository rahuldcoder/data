-- online classified service @entity5 's decision to censor its adult services section is a " good step but a continuing battle has to be fought , " a leader in the fight against prostitution ads said on sunday			1
" i 'm very pleased by this very solid and significant apparent step in the right direction , " said @entity11 attorney general @entity10 , who spearheaded a recent letter from 17 attorneys general urging @entity5 to discontinue its adult services section			1
" i say apparent because we have received no definite or definitive word from @entity5 that the shutdown is permanent or complete , " @entity10 told @entity0 's @entity16			1
@entity10 said he wants to broaden his fight against online prostitution ads but that " right now our focus is really on @entity5			1
" " we 're taking it one step at a time , " he said			0
" we want to verify and confirm that @entity5 is in fact shutting down ( its adult services section )			1
" the embattled website has been under fire for allegations that it promotes prostitution			2
" these prostitution ads enable human trafficking and assaults on women , " @entity10 said saturday			2
" they are flagrant and rampant			0
@entity5 has lacked the wherewithal or will to effectively screen them out			0
" the section that usually reads " adult services " on @entity5 was replaced saturday by the word " censored			1
" it was not clear whether @entity5 removed the adult services and replaced them with the " censored " section , which had a link that was not active			1
but for users who accessed the account outside the @entity47 , the adult services link was still active			1
@entity5 representatives said on saturday that they will release a statement at a later time			0
" if it remains shut down it will be a model for other sites , we hope , because @entity5 is by far the biggest , " said @entity10 , who is running for the @entity51 in @entity11 as a @entity52			1
he said that he would try to change federal laws to make it easier to prosecute sites like @entity5			1
" @entity5 says it can not be held legally responsible for anything on its site , " he said			2
" my belief is strongly ... that we need to change that			0
" in the august 24 letter to @entity5 ceo @entity65 and founder @entity66 , the attorneys general wrote : " the increasingly sharp public criticism of @entity5 's @entity69 reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it			1
" @entity10 said on sunday that attorneys general from three more states have joined his campaign against @entity5 's adult services ads. @entity10 did n't say which attorneys general joined the initial list of 17			1
a @entity5 spokeswoman said at the time that the site agreed with at least some of the letter			0
" we strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women , through the internet or by any other means , " said @entity85 , who handles press inquiries for @entity5			2
" we hope to work closely with them , as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement , to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking , and to combat such crimes wherever they appear , online or offline			0
" in their letter , the attorneys general highlighted an open letter , which appeared as a @entity107 ad , in which two girls said they were sold for sex on @entity5			2
when the ad came out , @entity65 wrote a blog post in response that said , " @entity5 is anxious to know that the perpetrators in these girls ' cases are behind bars			0
" the letter also highlighted a report in may by @entity0 's @entity119 , who posted a fake ad for a girl 's services in the adult section			2
she received 15 calls soliciting sex in three hours			0
earlier this month , @entity126 interviewed a woman named " @entity128 " who sells sex on @entity5			0
the woman said a @entity5 ad was " the fastest , quickest way you 're for sure going to see somebody that day			0
" in a later blog post , @entity65 said @entity5 implemented manual screening of adult services ads in may 2009			1
" since that time , before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney , " the post said			0
he said the attorneys are trained to enforce @entity5 's posting guidelines , " which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages , newspapers , or any other company that we are aware of			0

@entity166 was charged with the april 2009 killing of @entity170			0
@entity171 said that @entity170 , a model , advertised as a masseuse on @entity5 , and @entity166 might have met her through the website			2
