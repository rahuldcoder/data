the @entity0 is pulling millions of dollars in investments out of three @entity1 companies tied to the @entity5 occupation of @entity7 territories			1
in a close vote at its annual assembly in @entity11 on friday , the church voted 310 - 303 to divest $ 21 million from @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
the church says @entity12 supplies products to @entity5 that are used to destroy @entity7 homes , @entity13 provides logistics and technology to help enforce the naval blockade of @entity21 , and @entity14 provides military and surveillance systems in illegal @entity5 settlements			1
but immediately after the vote , church leaders said the decision was not a judgment against @entity5			1
" in no way is this a reflection for our lack of love for our @entity35 sisters and brothers , " moderator @entity28 said			0
the approved divestment proposal included a preface underscoring the denomination 's longstanding commitment to peace in the region and the suffering on both sides			0
" we recognize the complexity of the issues , the decades - long struggle , the pain suffered and inflicted by policies and practices of both the @entity5 government and the @entity7 entities , " it said			1
the church also stressed it still supports @entity5 and that the vote was not connected to the @entity56 ( @entity56 ) movement , an international campaign to punish the jewish state over the occupation of @entity7 lands and other hotly contested issues			1
vote stirs passionate responses but some @entity35 organizations , even those that support a two - state solution to the ongoing crisis in the region , see the decision as a direct result of and support for the @entity56 movement			1
the @entity74 ( @entity74 ) says the decision undermines the @entity5 - @entity7 peace process			1
" it is a very sad day for @entity0 - @entity35 relations when church leaders from across the @entity1 align with the international @entity56 ( @entity56 ) movement , " rabbi @entity76 , the @entity74 's director of interreligious and @entity78 , said in a statement			2
" this is an affront to all who are committed to a peaceful resolution of the @entity5 - @entity7 conflict , " @entity76 said			1
rabbi @entity87 , the president of the @entity88 , issued a statement after the vote calling it " a preference for a policy of isolation , rather than one of engagement			0
" " of course , we will continue to partner with our allies within the church who are committed to a two - state solution , reject the effort of the @entity56 campaign to delegitimize @entity5 's right to exist as a jewish state , and work toward a just and fair solution to enable the @entity7 to achieve the state that they deserve , " @entity87 said			1
the @entity108 called the move " out of step " with the majority of @entity112 in churches across the @entity1			0
the @entity108 's national director @entity114 said the decision also creates an atmosphere of open hostility			0
" " this resolution sends a painful message to @entity1 @entity35 and threatens the long - standing relationship between the @entity35 community and the national @entity0 with whom we have worked closely on many issues of mutual concern			2
" some @entity112 are condemning the vote , as well			2
the rev. @entity127 , the president of @entity129 's @entity128 , is calling on @entity112 opposed to the decision to reach out to their local @entity35 communities to try to repair relationships following the controversial vote			1
@entity134 said the vote " sets back the work toward a just and peaceful resolution to the @entity7 - @entity5 conflict			1
" " it hurts the @entity0 place at the table for peacemaking , and creates barriers not just between @entity112 and @entity35 , and @entity5 and @entity7 , but also within the @entity0 body			1
" @entity7 supporters of the @entity56 movement , meantime , said they are pleased with the church 's divestment decision and see it as a sign the movement is gaining momentum in @entity1			2
@entity154 , for one , calls the vote a " sweet victory			0
" " presbyterian supporters of @entity7 rights have not only solidly introduced divestment from @entity5 's occupation to the @entity1 mainstream , they have given the @entity7 people real hope in the face of the relentless cruelty of @entity5 's regime of occupation , settler colonialism and apartheid , " said @entity154 , a founding committee member of the @entity157			2
not a snap decision the denomination , the largest presbyterian body in the @entity1 , says it still supports the jewish state			0
" we have significant investments in @entity5 , " said church spokeswoman @entity176			2
and the church is keeping them			0
the decision was about morality , not politics , she said			0
there are many @entity7 @entity186 in the occupied territories that the church is concerned about and obligated to support			2
@entity189 said the church no longer wanted to profit from investing in companies that have a hand in the destruction of people 's homes and lives			0
instead , she said , it will now shift some of its investments into economic development programs in the @entity7 territories			1
the divestment from the three companies was not a snap decision			0
the church has discussed and considered the issue for the past 10 years			0
it almost passed a divestment proposal at its 2012 assembly , narrowly voting it down by just two votes			0
@entity189 said the vote may make the @entity112 seem unique among @entity1 protestants , but they are not alone			0
" there are other denominations that are grappling with this , " she said .			0

in a 310 - 303 vote , the church decides to pull $ 21 million in investments
it is divesting from @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
@entity35 *groups* , and some @entity112 , condemn the decision
the church is keeping other investments in @entity5 , while investing in @entity7 territories , too
