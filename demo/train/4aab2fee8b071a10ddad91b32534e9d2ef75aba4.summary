it was 3 a.m. in @entity1			1
presumably barely anyone was watching			0
but the country 's military chief chose that hour to appear on army - run @entity6 television tuesday to declare martial law across the country			1
" this is not a coup , " said gen. @entity10 , hours before the nation 's people woke to the new public order ; with soldiers stationed at intersections and tanks on the streets			1
the army says it has taken control to ensure law and order in a country split by deep political divisions , two weeks after the country 's @entity26 removed caretaker prime minister @entity29 from government			1
" the defendant has abused her position as prime minister , " said the judge in the ruling			0
" her prime ministership has ... ended			0
" nine cabinet ministers were also removed from office , while deputy pm and commerce minister @entity39 was appointed caretaker prime minister			0
how has the caretaker prime minister reacted ? @entity39 has not been removed from his post , although one of his aides , who declined to be named , told @entity45 the government had not been consulted before the military made its move			1
" we have to watch and see if what declared by the @entity51 chief is well honored , " he said , calling the events of tuesday morning " a half coup d'etat			1
" @entity39 later issued a statement on the imposition of martial law : " with reference to the @entity51 's declaration of the martial law to preserve order and bring back peacefulness to the country , the government wishes the same for national peace , and hopes that the martial law is imposed by way of peaceful means and equality with no violence and discrimination and under the legal state and the rule of law which is in accordance with the government 's ongoing policy , " he said			1
" this action of the @entity51 's must be under the principles of constitution and democracy with the @entity81 as head of state			1
" a long history of coups the people of @entity1 are all too familiar with coup d'etats			1
there have been at least 18 actual and attempted military takeovers since @entity1 became a constitutional monarchy in 1932			1
the last one was in 2006 when the military sent tanks onto the streets before ousting then prime minister @entity93 , the brother of @entity29 , who is now living in exile to avoid a corruption conviction he claims is politically motivated			0
@entity93 's supporters , known as red shirts , have also rallied around @entity29 , slamming her ousting as a " judicial coup			2
" thousands of protesters swarmed the streets following the ruling , seeking the removal of the caretaker government			0
their political rivals allege @entity29 is acting as a puppet leader for her brother and campaigned for her removal			0
the anti-government movement includes " yellow shirts , " predominantly urban , middle class members of the royalist establishment			0
members of the " red shirts " are typically rural working class			0
what does martial law look like in @entity1 ? within hours of declaring martial law , gen. @entity10 announced he would be leading a new security task force , the @entity121 ( @entity122 )			1
the task force 's advisory committee also includes chiefs of the navy , air force and national police , he said			0
soldiers were dispatched to stand guard at television stations			0
broadcasters , including 10 satellite tv stations , were ordered to shut down " to ensure that information will be distributed rightly and to prevent any distortions which could lead to misunderstandings and it could lead to wide spread conflicts			0
" images posted on social media showed soldiers patrolling the streets of @entity142			0
@entity143 , director at @entity144 told @entity45 they were positioned at intersections but so far there was no sign of unrest			0
" traffic is a real mess here at the moment			0
but there 's no violence			0
i think what the military is trying to do with this ' martial law light , ' if i can say that , is to convince protesters to go home			1
they 're trying to dial down the tensions here as well as preempt several large rallies and strikes that were scheduled for later this week , " he said			0
@entity167 , a journalist and author who focuses on @entity1 , told @entity45 the military 's decision to announce martial law at night indicated it was trying to do so " with minimal possible fuss			1
" what happens next ? @entity167 said it would become clearer in the next couple of days what the army 's intentions are ; whether it 's going to call an election or appoint a new government			2
" if they appoint a government it 's a coup by another name and you might see the start of violence from the red shirts , " he said			2
" martial law means the police are sidelined and they are no longer responsible for security			1
and the police in @entity1 are seen as heavily supportive of @entity93 and his allies , which is the red side of the battle			2
so when you 've got a police force that 's suddenly been sidelined that 's another combustible element in this mix. " so @entity1 is kind of on a knife - edge , " he said			2
did the military have no choice ? gen. @entity10 's move to impose martial law did n't come as a surprise , wrote @entity210 , digital editor for the @entity211			1
the army chief warned last week the military could be forced to act to end violent protests			2
" the country was moving towards a possible bloody clash between the two camps , leaving no choice for the army commander but to try to prevent it			0
as a general , he had only two choices : a military coup or martial law , " @entity210 wrote			1
" he picked the softer option and did as he had promised in last week 's statement , that the army does not want a coup because it would meaning tearing down the 2007 constitution			2
" however , @entity230 from @entity231 @entity1 said the situation in the country had not yet justified the army 's intervention			1
" there is no concrete proof that the situation in @entity1 is out of control to the extent that an enforcement of the martial law is essential			1
with the enforcement of martial law , the army is one step closer to taking over power completely from civilian administration			1
" " at the moment , military authorities have superior power over civil authority in keeping public order			2
there is no check and balance ; there are no safeguards against rights violations ; there are no remedies for any damage cause by the army			0
the fate of the nation is essentially in gen. @entity10 's hands , " he said			0
could the military broker peace in @entity1 ? @entity269 , a political science professor , said the declaration of martial law in @entity1 had broken the deadlock between warring parties , and the army was now in a position to mediate a possible resolution			1
" we 've been paralyzed in @entity1 because on one side we have protesters bent on replacing the government , and on the other side we have a caretaker government refusing to resign			2
" " if the army can play a mediating role in search of a compromise that satisfies all sides then we can find a way out of this crisis			0
but if it does not , if the army plays a partisan role , then we can see a lot more crises in @entity1 , " he warned			2
in a statement , the @entity295 encouraged all parties to " respect democratic principles " and also stressed the need for elections " to determine the will of the @entity1 people			2

@entity1 military says it 's imposition of martial law is not a coup d'etat
@entity309 made on army at 3 a.m. local time to cause " minimum fuss "
