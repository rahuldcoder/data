-- @entity1 is on the edge of the precipice as a consequence of the standoff between @entity7 prime minister @entity6 and @entity9 vice president @entity8 , with the former accusing the latter of engaging in terrorism and the latter accusing the former of dictatorial ambitions			1
this crisis involves all three major sectarian and ethnic groups in @entity1 , with @entity8 taking refuge in the autonomous @entity20 region of @entity1 as a guest of @entity1 's @entity20 president @entity22			1
what happens over the next couple of weeks will determine whether @entity1 will continue to exist as a unified state or begin to irretrievably unravel in sectarian strife			1
two realities stand out in the midst of all the noise and fury currently surrounding the debate in and over @entity1			0
first , it is clear that the @entity34 venture in @entity1 has ended in abject failure at the cost of 4,500 @entity34 lives and between 100,000 and 200,000 @entity1 lives			0
no weapons of mass destruction were found in @entity1 , nor was any link established between the @entity43 regime and @entity44			0
furthermore , as the events of the past few days demonstrate , the @entity34 has been largely unsuccessful in establishing an inclusive , democratic order in @entity1 , another objective touted by @entity48 to justify the invasion of @entity1 in 2003			0
what the @entity34 invasion ended up doing was creating unprecedented sectarian strife and totally debilitating @entity1 capabilities , thus tilting the regional balance of power in the energy - rich @entity55 substantially in favor of @entity57			1
second , it is only @entity57 that can now prevent @entity1 from sliding into the abyss of chaos and disintegration			2
this argument has a simple logic			0
@entity57 is the country with the greatest leverage with the @entity7 - dominated @entity6 government			1
in fact , @entity6 would not have been able to put together a coalition after haggling for nine months , and become prime minister for a second time after the last elections , had @entity57 not weighed in on his behalf			0
@entity57 is also the state with the greatest stake in keeping @entity1 unified and ensuring its sovereignty , because @entity1 's disintegration could adversely affect @entity57 's national integrity and its aspirations to become a regional leader in the @entity78			1
while the major @entity7 parties in @entity1 -- the @entity81 , the @entity82 , and the @entity83 -- are not @entity57 creations per se , all of them are beholden to @entity57 in multiple ways			1
their leaders lived in exile in @entity57 during @entity43 's rule , and the @entity89 trained their militias			0
their links with the @entity89 and the militias ' dependence on @entity57 training and weaponry continue to exist			0
whenever the going gets tough for any @entity1 @entity7 faction , its leaders take refuge in @entity57 , as @entity101 did time and again over the past few years			1
@entity1 dependence on @entity57 is bound to grow now that the @entity34 -- who had tended to favor the @entity7 over the @entity9 in @entity1 -- have departed the shores			1
the @entity6 government , its current bombast notwithstanding , will soon realize -- if it has not done so already -- that it is surrounded by a host of latently hostile @entity9 @entity108 neighbors , from @entity109 and @entity110 to @entity111 and potentially @entity112			0
@entity57 is its only dependable ally and one which it can not afford to alienate			0
@entity57 also forms the lifeline of the @entity1 economy , especially in the predominantly @entity7 south			1
@entity57 pilgrims flock to the @entity7 holy cities of @entity120 and @entity121 , providing livelihood to thousands of @entity1 citizens			1
cheap @entity57 manufactured products flood the @entity1 market , and @entity57 contractors are involved in infrastructure projects such as power , health and housing			2
@entity57 is now @entity1 's second largest trading partner after @entity131 , which has a near monopoly on trade with @entity134			1
additionally , @entity57 financial support keeps many @entity7 institutions , parties , and leaders afloat			2
in short , the @entity1 government 's dependence on @entity57 in political and economic terms is of a very high order			1
this provides @entity144 with enormous leverage that it can use , if it so desires , to compel the @entity6 government to undertake a radical course correction and return to the model of a more inclusive political system rather than one based simply on @entity7 demographic strength			0
@entity153 constitute approximately 60 % of the @entity1 population , with @entity9 and predominantly @entity155 each accounting for about 20 %			2
there is every reason to believe that such a course correction is in @entity57 's long - term interest for a number of reasons			1
first , if the @entity1 state disintegrates as a result of @entity6 's policies , @entity134 , currently an autonomous entity , will be emboldened to declare itself a sovereign , independent state			0
this would run contrary to @entity57 state interests , since @entity57 is also home to a restive @entity20 minority whose demands for autonomy border on independence			0
an independent @entity20 state next to @entity57 @entity134 would not only be a bad example ( from the perspective of the @entity57 state ) for @entity57 kurds , it would also become a center for @entity20 irredentism , stoking demands for @entity184 unity that would have deleterious consequences for both @entity57 and @entity131			0
second , @entity57 has regional ambitions not only in the @entity55 , but also in the broader @entity78 region			0
the @entity57 regime is fully aware of the fact that one of the major hurdles in its path toward regional pre-eminence is its @entity7 character			2
much of the rest of the @entity78 is predominantly @entity196			0
this was a major , if not the primary , reason that @entity57 's post-revolution leaders emphasized the " @entity83 " rather than the @entity7 nature of the @entity57 revolution , thus enhancing its appeal among the @entity9 majority in the @entity78			1
@entity57 's support to @entity196 causes -- the @entity207 cause foremost among them -- regardless of the sectarian composition of the affected @entity196 populations has added greatly to the popularity of the @entity212 , particularly among the @entity108 public			1
@entity6 's sectarian policy is bound to hurt not only @entity1 interests , but also the image of @entity57 in the @entity78 , and adversely affect its ambitions to act as a major player in the region , especially since @entity57 is perceived as the principal supporter of the @entity6 government			1
it is , therefore , in @entity57 's interest to rein in @entity6 's sectarian proclivities and to maneuver to have him replaced as @entity1 's leader if he is not amenable to @entity144 's advice			1
@entity101 can be used by @entity57 to pull the rug from under @entity6 's feet , since @entity6 is now dependent upon the 40 - member @entity82 group in @entity230 to keep him in office			0
( the @entity232 -- the coalition of @entity9 and secular @entity7 groups to which @entity8 belongs -- withdrew its support from the governing coalition			2
) that the @entity82 , one of the three main @entity7 groups in the @entity1 @entity230 , may be contemplating such a move themselves is indicated by their demand on monday that @entity230 be dissolved and new elections held			2
the @entity82 agenda may , in fact , coincide better with the @entity57 one , given @entity101 's visceral anti-americanism , which stands in sharp contrast to @entity6 's ambivalence toward the @entity34			0
but regardless of this fact , it is becoming increasingly evident that @entity6 's current policy runs contrary to @entity57 's interests			2
it is also clear that only @entity57 is in a position to force him to reverse course and thus to save @entity1 from disintegration and civil war			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity258 .			0

@entity1 is facing a sectarian crisis with @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity262 factions
@entity258 : @entity57 has the most influence over @entity1 's government
he says it 's *strongly* in @entity57 's interest to keep @entity1 as a single nation
@entity258 : the next several weeks could determine the fate of @entity1
