-- the newest monument in @entity2 dedicated to the memory and legacy of @entity5 is attracting thousands of @entity6 and foreign tourists			1
it will finally get its official day in the sun on sunday			2
that is when the federal government will formally dedicate the @entity12 on the @entity13			2
this weekend in @entity2 should not be a destination , however			1
it should be viewed as a new leg on a long journey to find the @entity6 that @entity5 spoke of 48 years ago when he gave his " @entity19 " speech			1
when a quarter - million people turned out for the 1963 historic @entity23 , the nation 's capital was also not so much a destination but a journey			2
it is that journey that several of @entity5 's @entity28 brothers took to heart to spark the campaign to build a memorial in his honor			1
little did they know their idea for a small tribute would become the monument that it is today			1
little did fraternity members know that the young @entity38 who joined the fraternity in 1952 at @entity40 would become a world leader and historic figure who inspires millions			2
fraternity historian @entity44 , a professor of history at @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48 , says the idea for the monument started 28 years ago when brother @entity51 and his wife , sitting at their kitchen table , said there should be a tribute to @entity5 in @entity2			1
@entity44 says they got the idea after watching president @entity59 sign into law the @entity5 holiday bill in the fall of 1983			1
@entity51 , then living in @entity63 , @entity64 , brought together four other @entity28 men in his local chapter , and from there the idea became a national mission of the fraternity			1
after years of producing fiscal and fundraising plans , drawings and blueprints and galvanizing public support , @entity28 persuaded @entity75 and key elements of the executive branch , including the @entity78 and the @entity79 , to green light the project			2
@entity5 's brothers ' dream is now a reality			1
" many people did n't think this could be built , but we did it , through hard work across the country , " said @entity85 , general president of the fraternity			2
" in our local chapters , we worked with community groups to build support from local leaders to members of @entity75 , pressing why it was important and why we were willing to do whatever was needed to make this memorial happen			0
" it also would take raising $ 120 million			0
@entity28 boasts the largest contingent of individuals to donate , at approximately $ 3 million			0
there are thousands of other private citizens who gave , including children who raised dollars at elementary school events			2
the @entity6 government allocated $ 10 million in matching funds , and the remainder came from about 100 corporate sponsors			1
thousands of people were set to descend on @entity2 on august 28 for the unveiling and dedication			1
it was planned to coincide with the anniversary of the 1963 march on @entity2			1
but @entity118 came along and disrupted everyone 's plans			0
it was going to be one big party , an international celebration not seen in @entity2 since the inauguration of president @entity125 in 2009			1
the fraternity did hold a private dedication that drew more than 5,000 on august 26 before the rest of the weekend events were canceled			0
this weekend 's government event may be a bit smaller than the originally planned celebration , but it will still have star power and a festive flair			1
the president will speak , civil rights legends will tell stories of the struggle , and we 'll hear about the long journey to build this worthwhile memorial			0
also , it still will have a link to an historic day in @entity6 : october 16 is the anniversary of the 1995 million man march			0
but the question remains , what really will happen after all the pomp and circumstance ? what lessons will be learned and applied ? this year , @entity5 would have turned 82 years old			1
he would be in the club of all those veteran civil rights warriors who have made it to the 21st century			0
the iconic rev. @entity155 , a co-founder the @entity156 with @entity5 , turned 90 last week			1
many now are in their twilight years			0
they march to a slower cadence , many with a third leg			0
some are pushed along in wheelchairs			0
many say the memorial is a marvelous and well - deserved tribute to a man who helped @entity6 find its soul			0
a man who showed the country how its citizens could - and should - be treated despite their race , color , creed or station in life			0
none of us know what @entity5 would think of all the euphoria surrounding this memorial , but my guess is that he would say we still have a lot of work to do			1
you do not have to look far for evidence that he would be right			0
a recent poll by the @entity189 shows that the wealth gap between whites and @entity192 - and latino - americans has grown by leaps and bounds			0
according to @entity189 , " median wealth of white households is 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of @entity201 households			0
" so it is clear the @entity5 memorial has to be more than just a " stone of hope			1
" it must be more than just another tourist site we put on our maps			0
it has to rekindle the enthusiasm in people for those issues @entity5 cared about			2
it has to be a living monument			0
it has to transform lives of those who will make the journey to see it up close			0
" the @entity28 men who originally pushed this idea of a memorial saw this not just to honor @entity5 , but as an inspiration to schoolchildren who visit the capital each year , " @entity44 said			1
" having this memorial to @entity5 could be inspirational as they go back home			2
" @entity51 never got to see his dream become reality			0
he died several years ago			1
but now the world has the chance to benefit from that dream and to see @entity5 in a new way			2
however , it will mean nothing if we do not put action and meaning into what we glean from this monument			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			2
