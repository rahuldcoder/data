-- the show " @entity1 " has decided to use some levity to deal with a name that is far from funny these days			2
the adult animated fx series focuses on operative @entity1 ( voiced by actor h. @entity6 ) , who works for the @entity9 - based @entity8 , or @entity10			1
given the negative connotation now attached to the name , the @entity11 reports that it will be phased out when the show returns in january			0
creator @entity15 said he and the executive producers @entity16 and @entity18 decided that the name will go away in the first show of season 6			1
@entity15 said he suspected it might become an issue as the terrorist group the @entity24 and @entity25 began to make headlines			0
" back in season 5 , @entity27 said , ' this might be a thing , ' and i thought , ' maybe it wo n't be ? maybe it 'll be the mole that i 'm gon na ignore and nothing will happen , ' " he told the @entity11			1
" we got sort of lucky and could organically make a merger with the @entity37 , so we went back and retroactively painted out the @entity10 logos in parts of the show , and we just do n't talk about it in dialogue			1
" fans will see two movers pushing out the large circular blue @entity10 sign while spy @entity46 ( voiced by veteran actress @entity47 ) explains to her son that they now work for the @entity37			2
" it 's just the most awful thing , and we did n't want to have anything to do with it , " @entity18 said			1
" there were people online saying that we should address it and say , ' oh , i ca n't believe these guys have co-opted our name			0
' that 's the way ' @entity59 ' would do it , coming after them and saying , ' these a * * holes stole our name , ' but that 's not the way the @entity1 universe works , where it 's all our own creations			0
in our universe , they do n't exist			0
