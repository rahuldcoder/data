can you hear the music ? @entity2 is the birthplace of grunge			1
@entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 spawned an entire era of flannel shirts , unkempt facial hair and teen angst			0

the fishmongers at the world - famous market are skilled in the art of tossing fish ordered by customers			0
@entity114 was founded in 1907 and is one of the oldest open - air , public farmers markets in the @entity22			1
but there 's more to this market than just the amazing , locally grown food			2
wonderful restaurants , unique shops , the @entity130 and eccentric buskers really make the trip down to @entity133 worth your while			0
and if you 're wiped out from all that shopping , walk across the street to the original @entity137 to grab some java			0
speaking of coffee , did i mention that @entity141 has a time share here ? you ca n't swing a laptop in this town without hitting a coffee stand that features tons of flavors , roasts and a plethora of options for the caffeine junkie			0
sorry @entity42 , but as much as we love our sister to the south , the fact is that @entity2 has everything we could want and more			1
