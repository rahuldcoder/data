for 19 years , the cold case of two slain prostitutes weighed heavily on the small military town of @entity3 , @entity4 , especially after the brothel 's madam publicly accused two allegedly corrupt police officers of the killings			1
because the madam 's accusation was boldly made during a @entity14 meeting three years after the deaths , everyone in town has long known of the suspicions , but local police and the @entity18 were unable to crack the case			1
now , a seven - year investigation by the @entity21 has resulted in charges against the two police officers , both of whom have since left the force , and a third man			1
one of the former officers was a detective who appeared at the crime scene with other officers to investigate the killings , said one former officer who was first on the scene			2
for now , @entity3 , adjacent to the @entity35 's @entity34 , is feeling relief from the tantalizing mystery , but the town 's mayor said wednesday he suspects the case could become even bigger			1
" i think this is just the tip of the iceberg			2
i think there are more arrests coming , " said @entity43 , who was n't mayor when the killings occurred in 1994			2
" would n't the other police officers know ? " one of the former officers , @entity51 , 50 , already is serving a three - year prison sentence after pleading guilty in september to tampering with physical evidence in the case , state police said			1
@entity51 , of @entity56 , @entity4 , was charged this month with two counts of complicity to murder , police said			1
former officer @entity62 , 43 , of @entity63 , @entity4 , was charged with two counts of murder and is being held by the @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity18 pending his extradition to @entity4 , said @entity61 trooper @entity60 said			1
it was not immediately clear if @entity62 has retained an attorney			1
a third man who was never a police officer , @entity71 , 39 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , also was charged with two counts of murder and is being held by @entity73 authorities pending extradition to @entity4 , @entity60 said			1
@entity71 's father , @entity77 , told @entity78 that his son -- who was living in nearby @entity80 , @entity81 , at the time of the killings -- is innocent and says he is n't sure how his son came to be associated with @entity51 and @entity85 -- or if they were at all			0
@entity62 and @entity71 are being held in lieu of $ 1 million bail , @entity60 said			0
@entity51 's attorney , @entity89 , said his client " maintains his innocence and denies being involved in the murders or intentionally doing anything to cover up or conceal the identities of the murderer or murderers			1
" " mr. @entity51 pled guilty in september of this year as a result of his mishandling of the police investigation immediately following the murders in 1994 , " @entity97 said			1
" he expressed remorse and regret to the victims ' families and to the court for his inadequacies as a young inexperienced detective with too much responsibility on his shoulders , " @entity97 said			0
the charges against all three men stem from the 1994 killings of @entity115 , 22 , and @entity116 , 18 , who worked as prostitutes at the @entity118 , police said			1
" needless to say , since it 's an open and active investigation , we ca n't get too much into the details , " @entity60 said this week			1
" the @entity21 got the investigation back in 2006			1
our investigators , once we get an investigation from another agency , we start from square one and go through all the information available with a fine - tooth comb			1
" a fellow officer 's suspicions former officer @entity131 , who was first to arrive at the scene of the killings , recalled his suspicions of @entity62 and @entity51 at the time			0
" i suspected that they may have been involved , but did n't have evidence , " said @entity131 , who had joined the force only a year before			1
@entity115 , a mother of two , " was still alive " when he arrived , @entity131 said , " but she died on the way to the hospital			0
" " once @entity51 got there , he was the detective , so it became his scene , " he said			0
in an interview this week with @entity78 , @entity131 claimed @entity51 disturbed crime scene evidence			1
" @entity51 ran in there and messed up the scene			0
the phone was off the hook when i arrived , but then after @entity51 was in there , the phone was back on the receiver , " @entity131 said			0
" no one had ever asked me -- the first officer on the scene -- anything about this case			2
no one ever asked me anything until the state police took over -- years after it happened			1
" @entity131 , who went on to be a city councilman and served until last year , said he and @entity51 had been friendly back then			2
" he could be a nice guy , but he could have a real temper , " @entity131 said			0
@entity163 : ' they knew we had stuff on them ' three years after the killings , then - councilwoman @entity167 announced that she , too , was a former prostitute at the massage parlor			1
she and other prostitutes gave police sexual favors at a discount or at no cost , she alleged			1
" if they were police officers , that 's what we had to do whether we wanted to or not , which we did n't like , " @entity167 told @entity78 in 1997			2
this week , @entity131 recalled the city council meeting in 1997 when @entity181 , the massage parlor 's madam , dramatically accused the police officers of extortion and murder			2
@entity181 could n't be reached by @entity78 for comment this week			0
but in a 1997 interview , @entity181 alleged of police : " they were n't getting any more money from us , and they knew we had stuff on them			2
the only way to keep us quiet is to kill the girls and put us in jail			0
" @entity181 made further accusations in the @entity78 article that year , when she had already quit being a madam			2
" i did what they told me to do , " she said			0
" if they needed new police lights , i bought new police lights			2
if they needed birthday money , i gave them birthday money			0
if they needed money for a trailer to be moved ... basically anything they told me they needed , i gave them the money for it			0
" @entity115 and @entity219 were shot in the head , and their throats were slashed , @entity181 said			0
" it was devastating to us , " @entity181 said in 1997			0
" they both had babies			0
one was breastfeeding her baby			0
it was just a few weeks old			0
" taken : the coldest case ever solved a pall in the aftermath also in 1997 , the @entity234 sheriff 's department said crime scene evidence was botched by police , and then - sheriff @entity237 said @entity62 was a prime suspect			1
he had been at the scene 30 minutes before the slayings , according to authorities			0
" there 's other information that we have that leads us to believe that @entity62 would be a good suspect , " @entity237 said			0
then - mayor @entity245 said the killings cast a pall over the small town : " there 's a cloud hanging over us right now and there 's no rain , " he said			2
" let 's get it to either rain or let the wind blow the cloud out and let 's get moving forward to the future			0
" in 1998 , a federal court in @entity4 ruled in favor of @entity219 ' husband and her two children in their lawsuit against @entity181 and @entity268 , who owned the massage parlor business , court papers show			1
the court issued a default judgment against the @entity272 for failing to respond to , or defend against , the @entity219 family 's lawsuit , which accused the @entity275 of negligence in @entity219 ' death			0
a @entity280 @entity279 judge , however , dismissed the @entity282 ' negligence claims against @entity283 , the owner of the building where the massage parlor was located			0
