-- @entity1 , the former deputy director general of the @entity2 recently asserted that @entity3 having passed the " @entity7 " in its nuclear weapons program could within two weeks have the ability to enrich enough missile - grade uranium to build a bomb			1
yet @entity10 - led direct negotiations with @entity3 broke down in @entity11 while the potential remains for the unraveling of sanctions			1
@entity15 wants @entity3 's enrichment of uranium set back by 12 months along with the dismantling of numerous centrifuges			1
the @entity10 , however , is willing to set it back by five months			0
@entity15 fears the problem with the @entity10 timeline is if @entity3 kicks out inspectors , @entity23 would not have sufficient time to gear up militarily			1
at @entity11 , @entity3 opposed suspending work on its plutonium - producing reactor at @entity29 and downgrade its stockpile of higher - enriched uranium			2
@entity15 notes that recently @entity3 has planned for 34 new nuclear sites to be constructed along the country 's @entity34 and @entity35 coasts			1
@entity37 , the head of the @entity3 parliament 's foreign affairs committee recently asserted that @entity3 will never agree to dismantle the @entity41 uranium enrichment facility			2
@entity42 , the vice president of the @entity43 notes that this was a key concession that officials in the @entity10 and @entity47 had expected @entity3 to make			2
@entity49 countries such as @entity50 and @entity51 have been able to push back against @entity10 - led negotiations with @entity3 by allowing countries like @entity54 to curry favor with them			1
thus it is possible that @entity54 scuttled the deal on offer in @entity11 in order to win energy and military contracts in @entity50 and the @entity51 at the @entity10 's expense			1
@entity54 has also increased defence ties with @entity15			0
for these reasons there is little chance that @entity15 and @entity50 will not lobby to derail @entity69 talks when they reconvene in november 20			2
a skeptic urges : give @entity3 talks time @entity15 is also concerned that the unraveling of sanctions accompanied with @entity3 's increased enrichment of uranium will be blamed by the @entity77 administration on its settlement policy			1
secretary @entity80 's harsh criticism of @entity15 's settlement policy is linked to president @entity77 's original position that the road to @entity84 runs through @entity85			0
in an interview with @entity88 , @entity10 secretary of defense , @entity86 described one of the main strategic interests of the @entity10 in the @entity91 as resolving the @entity15 - @entity93 issue			1
this is at a time of more than 100,000 people killed in @entity97 with a mass refugee crisis spilling over the borders threatening the stability and security of @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104			2
@entity91 borders drawn by the @entity106 are disintegrating			0
red lines have been crossed in @entity97 as chemical weapons have been used by the @entity110 regime which suffers no consequences while subsequently being increasingly reluctant to reveal all its sites or offer access to them to chemical inspectors			0
@entity3 could follow suit by avoiding tougher sanctions by appearing to cooperate with the @entity10 , playing for time while creating and exploiting differences between the @entity10 on one hand and @entity15 and @entity50 on the other			1
they already did this by backing out of the @entity11 point at the last hour			0
@entity3 could maintain their core nuclear program making peripheral relinquishments so that they could reconstitute their program and a nuclear weapon in a moment 's notice			2
a @entity134 - @entity133 war is brewing across the region with the @entity10 's policies ironically emboldening @entity137 by supporting the @entity138 in @entity139 and its hands - off approach that emboldened jihadists in @entity97			1
at the same time the @entity10 is relinquishing its role in the @entity91 to @entity144 much to the consternation of @entity50 and @entity15			1
at a time of austerity leading to the slashing of military budgets and a less than comprehensive foreign policy it is surreal that the @entity77 administration would seek to focus on imposing a solution to the @entity15 - @entity93 conflict			2
the @entity10 was reluctant to commit troops to @entity156 or @entity97 where mass slaughter has been committed , and yet is willing to commit troops to the @entity102 valley			2
amid austerity , the @entity10 has abandoned the promotion of democracy , prevention of humanitarian catastrophe and resisted becoming involved in " someone else 's civil war			0
" thus president @entity77 is incompetent by being unable to prioritize security threats and strategic interests			0
a senior @entity15 defence official told me that the alternative is that president @entity77 genuinely thinks that the @entity93 and @entity15 are the problem -- the source of all the region 's ills			0
he revealed his country 's national consciousness saying gravely , " jews have heard that accusation before but today is different , the state of @entity15 exists and we refuse to be vulnerable			0
" @entity10 - @entity15 rift over @entity3 nukes now in the open @entity15 does not see the @entity10 as a reliable ally , especially in light of leaks from the @entity186 on targets that the @entity10 had of @entity97 's military instillations and chemical sites giving the @entity110 regime the time to disperse it into densely populated areas ; and more recently on @entity15 's strike on @entity195 's weapons shipments giving @entity195 an excuse to strike back			1
the combined result is that the @entity10 's allies in the region -- mainly the @entity34 and @entity15 are feeling cornered with the high probability that @entity15 will feel forced to strike @entity3 before the @entity77 administration decides to proceed with independent negotiations with @entity3 and unilaterally roll back sanctions allowing @entity3 to become a nuclear threshold state			1
@entity50 and @entity15 care more about @entity10 sanctions than @entity207 ones ; @entity207 and @entity209 sanctions hurt @entity3 less than @entity10 ones as even if @entity207 banks do n't offer letters of credit to @entity3 , it is because of the @entity10 sanctions			1
if @entity207 does not buy oil from @entity3 , @entity3 will go and sell it to @entity217			0
@entity50 , @entity139 and @entity103 will also seek to go nuclear in the event that the @entity10 fails to prevent @entity3 from gaining nuclear status			1
former @entity15 defence officials that i spoke with that were previously averse to the idea of a military strike on @entity3 are increasingly warming to it			2
@entity226 and @entity15 have increased their intelligence sharing to counter an @entity3 threat			0
it was the former that @entity230 revealed urging president @entity77 to " cut the head of the snake			0
" the international community including the @entity10 and @entity234 will publically denunciate @entity15 's actions while privately offering a sigh of relief in the same way that it did in the aftermath of @entity15 's strikes against @entity242 's nuclear facility in @entity243 in 1981			1
it is foolhardy to write off @entity246 's threats as mere bluster and one has to understand the @entity15 psyche			0
an @entity3 bomb would be the death knell for @entity252			0
former @entity3 president @entity254 in the past observed that targeting @entity15 by the , " application of an atomic bomb would not leave anything in @entity15 but the same thing would just produce damages in the @entity138 world			1
" it would be a historical irony if after over half a century of declaring " @entity267 " and posing as an insurance policy for the physical survival of the @entity266 people , @entity15 become a state ghetto with a concentration of @entity266 people becoming vulnerable to a nuclear attack			0
@entity15 considers the @entity11 talks as contributing to just that			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity276 .			0

former @entity2 deputy : @entity3 could have ability to enrich bomb - grade uranium in 2 weeks
@entity15 fears @entity23 would have *insufficient* time to gear up militarily - @entity276
@entity276 : @entity10 's policies *aiding* @entity137 , by backing @entity138 in @entity139 and @entity97 jihadists
@entity50 , @entity139 and @entity103 as well as @entity15 all fear @entity3 gaining nuclear status - @entity276
