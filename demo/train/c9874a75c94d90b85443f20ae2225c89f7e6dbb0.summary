@entity0 resigned friday as the head of the @entity2 , leaving behind the daunting task of repairing a broken health care system that has left thousands of veterans at risk as they wait for medical care			1
@entity0 's resignation concluded a firestorm of criticism and growing calls for him to step down following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at @entity17 hospitals , allegations exposed by @entity19 in a series of exclusive reports			1
details of the delays were first exposed by @entity19 last november in an investigation into two @entity17 hospitals in the @entity26			2
since then , @entity19 's reporting has expanded to include numerous other @entity17 hospitals , culminating with details about secret waiting lists at the @entity17 that may have played a role in the deaths of 40 veterans			1
president @entity34 went before reporters at the @entity36 minutes after meeting with @entity0 , saying the retired army general told him " the @entity17 needs new leadership " to address widespread issues that were chronicled in new reports this week			1
@entity34 said @entity0 " does not want to be a distraction			1
" " that was @entity44 's judgment on behalf of his fellow veterans , and i agree			2
we do n't have time for distractions			0
we need to fix the problem , " @entity34 said			2
calls for @entity0 's resignation snowballed in recent days from across the political spectrum -- republicans and @entity54 , as well as veterans ' advocacy groups -- because of the misconduct			1
in a farewell message to @entity17 employees , @entity0 did n't address the scandal specifically but did say he resigned with veterans ' interests in mind			1
" my personal and professional commitment and my loyalty to veterans , their families and our survivors was the driving force behind that decision , " he said			2
" that loyalty has never wavered , and it will never wane			0
" @entity0 says ' situation can be fixed , ' but not by him earlier friday , @entity0 announced steps to address the @entity17 shortcomings , including removing senior leaders in the @entity17 medical system , eliminating performance awards for @entity17 leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans			1
he also apologized to veterans and @entity86 , but declared : " this situation can be fixed			0
" but @entity0 wo n't be part of the solution			2
he went to the @entity36 to present @entity34 with findings from his internal audit of what was happening in the @entity17 system , including that many audited facilities had " questionable scheduling practices " that signaled a " systemic lack of integrity			1
" read the @entity17 audit report the president acknowledged that scheduling issues did n't rise to the attention of @entity0 , whom he praised as a man who " has served his country with honor for nearly 50 years			1
" at the same time , @entity34 said that he and @entity0 agreed that a shift in leadership was necessary			2
for now , @entity109 -- a @entity0 deputy -- will head the va until a new secretary is named and confirmed			2
" part of that is going to be technology			0
part of that is management , " the president said			0
" but as @entity118 himself indicated , there is a need for a change in culture within the @entity123 , and perhaps the @entity123 as a whole -- or the @entity17 as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed			0
" read @entity34 's statement breaking open the scandal @entity130 waits lists alleged in @entity132 problems in the @entity17 system date back decades , but @entity19 's reporting of long waits at @entity17 hospitals brought the issue into national focus at the end of 2013			1
an april report by @entity19 in which sources said 40 veterans died at a @entity17 facility that used secret waiting lists to cover up the problem prompted angry calls for action			2
the @entity17 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care			0
@entity19 also obtained an e-mail written by an employee at a @entity153 that said staff was instructed to " game the system " to make the clinic appear more efficient			0
a preliminary inspector general 's report made public wednesday described a " systemic " practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the @entity123 in @entity132			0
the @entity17 's troubled history according to the report , at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the @entity17 , raising the question of just how many more may have been " forgotten or lost " in the system			1
in a recent @entity172 opinion piece , @entity0 ordered @entity17 officials to contact each of these veterans " in order to bring the care they need and deserve			1
" the latest report by the @entity17 inspector general 's office and @entity0 's auditors indicated a link between employee bonuses and covering up patient wait times			1
there also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record - keeping to cover up delays at @entity17 hospitals			0
@entity34 said friday that would be up to the @entity192 , which has been collecting information but has not launched any investigation			0
shortly before he resigned , @entity0 told a veterans group that he was shocked by the inspector general 's report , especially the prevalence of wait lists for veterans needing medical care			1
" that breach of integrity is irresponsible , it is indefensible and unacceptable to me , " he told the @entity202 just before heading over to his final meeting with @entity34			0
" i said when this situation began weeks to months ago and i thought the problem was limited and isolated because i believed that			0
i no longer believe that			0
it is systemic , " he said			0
at the same time , the @entity17 chief of more than five years said that others had misled him			0
" i was too trusting of some , and i accepted as accurate reports that i now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait times , " he said			0
" i ca n't explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our health care facilities			0
this is something i rarely encountered during 38 years in uniform and so i will not defend it because it 's indefensible , but i can take responsibility for it and i do			0
" @entity0 could n't weather firestorm whistleblower : @entity17 was ' way too focused on ... good numbers ' as the accusations mounted -- including the latest one in which reps			1
@entity233 and @entity234 of @entity235 claimed 700 veterans had been placed on a primary care waiting list for doctor appointments at the @entity240 center , with some waiting since 2012 -- so too did the pressure on @entity0			2
senators calling for @entity0 resignation politicians largely applauded @entity0 's resignation on friday , even as they said that the @entity17 needed to do more than put new people in his place to resolve its shortcomings			1
" the denial of care to our veterans is a national disgrace , and it 's fitting that the person who oversees the @entity2 has accepted responsibility for this growing scandal and resigned , " @entity249 leader @entity249 of @entity250 said in a statement			0
meanwhile , a @entity17 whistleblower who told @entity19 about the problems at the @entity132 facility said friday he was saddened by @entity0 's resignation under such circumstances			1
" the @entity17 administrators got way too focused on having good numbers and they forgot the most important mandate , the reason we all work at the @entity17 -- to take care of veterans , to save their lives and give them good medical care , " dr. @entity266 said			2
" the next secretary 's biggest challenge will be to get that refocused and make sure the number one job is taking care of veterans - not worrying about their bureaucratic careers , " @entity266 added			1

@entity34 accepts @entity17 secretary 's resignation , says @entity0 does n't want to be a distraction
@entity0 says his commitment to veterans drove his decision to resign
the move comes after months of reports about problems with the @entity17 medical system
