-- two of the main companies involved in the disastrous 2010 @entity5 oil spill were more focused on personal injury risks than the potential for a major accident , a federal agency said in a report released tuesday			1
the @entity10 , an independent federal agency entrusted with investigating serious chemical accidents , released findings from their months - long analysis tuesday at a public hearing in @entity15			0
the @entity10 said two of the main companies involved , @entity16 and @entity17 , as well as @entity19 regulators , focused too heavily on personal injury issues such as dropping objects , slips , trips and falls instead of on overarching considerations of importance , such as the potential of losing control of an oil well or drilling using a complicated rig			1
three lessons linger from @entity16 oil spill the disaster began on april 20 , 2010 , when an explosion aboard the @entity38 drilling rig killed 11 people and caused a three - month - long oil spill , sending nearly 5 million barrels of crude spewing into the @entity5			1
" a number of past @entity10 investigations have found companies focusing on personal injury rates while virtually overlooking looming process safety issues -- like the effectiveness of barriers against hazardous releases , automatic shutoff system failures , activation of pressure relief devices , and loss of containment of liquids and gases , " @entity10 chairman @entity43 said			1
the agency said the oil industry had not learned key lessons from a 2005 blast at a @entity16 refinery in @entity64 -- an incident it said bears an " eerie resemblance " to the @entity38 disaster			2
during that incident , a fire and explosion during startup of a unit that raises gasoline octane killed 15 people and injured 180 others			0
@entity76 wins suit filed by @entity78 over oil cleanup machine the @entity10 pointed out that during both occasions , workers were being congratulated for low rates of personal injuries on the very day that the explosions occurred			2
" the emphasis on personal injury and lost work - time data obscures the bigger picture : that companies need to develop indicators that give them realistic information about their potential for catastrophic accidents			1
how safety is measured and managed is at the very core of accident prevention , " said @entity10 investigator @entity96			2
" if companies are not measuring safety performance effectively and using those data to continuously improve , they will likely be left in the dark about their safety risks			2
" the @entity105 ( @entity105 ) , the now - defunct agency under the @entity106 that oversaw offshore oil exploration and production during the time of the 2010 accident , had already given @entity16 and @entity17 a total of 15 safety awards , and @entity16 was a finalist for yet another			1
but @entity10 investigators found that the deciding factors used to determine recipients were based on personal safety records and not on safety management programs designed to prevent serious disasters			0
@entity121 engineer says company records clear him in @entity5 spill the @entity106 subsequently dismantled the mms and formed the @entity124 ( bsee )			2
besides concluding that @entity17 and @entity16 had " multiple safety management system deficiencies that contributed " to the oil spill , the @entity10 also found the federal government should adopt some changes with its policies			1
in tuesday 's report , the agency concluded the @entity106 still needs to develop a better safety indicator program for reporting potential precursors to major incidents instead of just reporting accidents			1
the @entity10 is a @entity136 - based independent federal agency charged with investigating industrial chemical accidents			0
board members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the @entity140			0
in april , @entity16 announced that it had reached an estimated at $ 7.8 billion settlement with thousands of businesses and individuals who filed damage claims in the wake of the spill			0
independent scientists have said the spill harmed marine life and bird populations as well as coral reefs in the @entity5			0
other researchers said they have found at least one plume of hydrocarbons from the well deep below the surface			0
@entity156 drilling : from ' hell no ! ' to ... ' ok '			0

report : @entity16 , @entity17 , regulators focused too heavily on personal injury issues
past investigations saw companies " virtually overlooking looming process safety issues "
11 people died and 5 million barrels of oil spilled in the 2010 @entity5 disaster
report : @entity106 needs to a better job of reporting major accident risks
