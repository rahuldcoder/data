-- this week we mark @entity2 , commemorating the electrifying moment on september 17 , 1787 when the @entity5 framers went public with their proposed @entity2			1
over the ensuing year , @entity6 debated and ratified this audacious plan , and thereby gave birth to a far better world			1
let 's recall the central features of that year that changed everything so that we can measure how far we have come , and how far we still need to go , to redeem the @entity2 's promise			2
after its public unveiling in mid-september , the @entity5 plan was put to a vote across the continent , in a process that let vastly more ordinary folk than ever before in human history decide how they would be governed			0
in most states , standard property qualifications were lowered or eliminated for this special ratification election			0
@entity27 , for the first time in its history , let all adult free male citizens vote -- no property qualifications , no race tests , no religious qualifications , no literacy tests -- for ratifying - convention delegates who in turn voted yes on the @entity2 several months later			1
later generations have nobly built upon this foundation , repeatedly adding the words " the right to vote " in a grand colonnade of amendments promising a permanent end to all sorts of electoral discrimination and exclusions			0
but @entity6 no longer leads the world in the integrity and inclusiveness of our elections ; several states are now shamelessly trying to roll back voting rights ; the @entity55 has renounced a key piece of the landmark @entity57 ; and @entity59 has yet to mend the tattered statute			1
modern @entity6 free speech is a happier story , with robust free expression in almost every corner of the land			1
here , too , we have 1787 - 88 to thank , a year when @entity6 dramatically embodied free speech in the very process of establishing the @entity2			1
no one was censored that year , and the document 's opponents were not forever demonized or voted off the island			0
in fact , several of the @entity2 's early critics came to rank among the new nation 's highest leaders -- for example , president @entity77 , vice presidents @entity78 and @entity80 , and @entity55 @entity81			2
the two camps that had sharply divided over the @entity2 's ratification -- the @entity84 and the @entity85 -- soon thereafter found common ground in supporting a @entity87			1
is it too much to hope that today 's polarized parties might learn something from this inspiring example , and try to find something -- anything ! -- that they can agree upon ? perhaps because the @entity2 's supporters did not try to muzzle skeptics , these skeptics , when outvoted , acquiesced			2
in several states , the document squeaked through only by the narrowest of margins -- for example , 30 to 27 in @entity27			0
yet everyone accepted the basic principle of majority rule , even though the document itself did not explicitly specify this voting rule			0
here , too , there are lessons for today			0
the entrenched filibuster has made the current @entity112 a deeply dysfunctional body , yet some senators seem to think that a supermajority - rule system has deep roots in founding principles and practices			0
the early @entity112 followed the principles of 1787 - 88 , and the key principle that year in every single state ratifying convention was simple majority rule			2
everyone got to speak ; and then votes ensued , and simple majorities prevailed			0
finally , let 's note the extraordinary religious inclusion championed by the document first unveiled in mid-september 1787			0
unlike most revolutionary state constitutions and the contemporaneous rules generally in place elsewhere on the planet , the @entity2 opened its doors to office seekers of all faiths and philosophies			1
last year , three of the four men atop the major party tickets -- @entity139 , @entity140 , and @entity141 -- were not members of the mainstream @entity144 churches that dominated society at the founding			0
today 's speaker of the @entity148 is a @entity149 , the @entity112 majority leader is a @entity151 , and no @entity144 sits on the current @entity6 @entity55			2
one is tempted to say , " only in @entity6 ! " but in fact there are other modern countries that are democratic and religiously pluralist			2
however , many of these democracies have been powerfully influenced by the @entity6 constitutional experience			1
before the @entity2 went public in 1787 , pluralistic democracy existed almost nowhere on the planet , outside @entity6			1
thus it had always been throughout recorded history			0
today , constitutional self - government reigns across half the globe , and it does so thanks largely to the legal , political , cultural , moral and military success of the @entity6 constitutional project			1
in short , the world is becoming more @entity6 ( and @entity6 itself , thanks to trade and immigration , is becoming more global )			2
so we should not say " only in @entity6 , " but rather " only because of @entity6 " -- and in particular , because of @entity6 's @entity2 and because of the year that changed everything			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

this week marks the *anniversary* of the unveiling of the @entity2 in 1787
@entity175 : over the following 12 months , @entity6 debated the ground rules for a new kind of democracy
on voting rights , the @entity6 has recently taken backward steps ; free speech is *flourishing* , he says
@entity175 : constitutional self - government rules half the globe , thanks to @entity6 example
