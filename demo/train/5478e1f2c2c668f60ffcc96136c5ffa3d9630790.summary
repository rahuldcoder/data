-- @entity2 's private journal sat unnoticed on his great - grandson 's bookshelf in @entity5 for at least a year			1
full of notes that would inform his legendary novel " @entity17 " and other stories , the thin , unmarked book had probably been lugged down from the attic at some point , along with other things the @entity2 family had passed down for more than a century and placed inconspicuously in @entity14 ' @entity16 home			1
then , one day not long ago , a researcher working on a project about @entity2 got in touch with @entity14 to ask if he might know anything about a journal his famous relative kept			1
@entity14 looked around and finally popped open this tiny book			2
it was signed " @entity2			2
" " it 's kind of incredible , but @entity14 was rather @entity31 © about it , " laughed @entity26 , @entity14 ' cousin and a professor in @entity28 who has written a book about @entity2			1
when news reached @entity26 that the journal had been discovered , he cajoled his cousin into sending him photographs of a few pages			1
" when i saw it , i was amazed , " @entity26 said			2
" i thought , ' the @entity39 ! we 've found it ! ' there is so little written by @entity2 about @entity2			1
family , scholars and hard - core fans -- so many people have wanted to know what made the man who wrote ' @entity17 ' tick			0
and here we had a major set of clues			0
" those clues will be published next march in " @entity53 , " @entity26 told @entity0			1
the publication will mark 100 years since the author died in april 1912			1
@entity26 has worked with @entity2 scholars to annotate " @entity53 , " which also offers quirky bits of folklore from @entity59 , @entity2 's homeland , and insight into the inspiration for his other work			1
there are 305 entries , some pages - long , others just a few sentences			0
@entity2 was in his early 20s when the journal began in 1871			1
he had graduated from @entity59 's @entity70 and was working at @entity71			0
it would be more than a decade before the author learned about the primary inspiration for his @entity17 , " @entity75			0
" the real - life prince of @entity78 who ruled during the @entity80 conquest of the @entity81 , @entity75 earned his nickname by impaling his enemies			0
his viciousness became notorious in @entity85 and other parts of @entity87 where tales spread of a man - monster who lived off blood			0
@entity75 's father was a member of the @entity93 , or @entity94			0
" @entity96 " means @entity95			0
the last entry of @entity2 's journal in 1881 hints at a major character he would use in " @entity96			1
" in the novel , @entity100 is an asylum inmate who has delusions that compel him to eat living beings , including flies , to gain their life force			0
the vampire @entity17 seizes on @entity100 's weakness and offers him as many creatures as he can eat in exchange for his eternal devotion			0
it does n't work out well for @entity100 in the end			0
in his journal , @entity2 wrote : " i once knew a boy who put so many flies into a bottle that they had not room to die			1
" in another passage , the author seems to be alluding to a vampire 's inability to see his own reflection			2
" story of man who reflects everybody 's self who meets him , " he wrote			0
@entity2 's interest in spookiness shows up in other journal entries			1
" a man builds up his shadow on a wall bit by bit by adding to substance , " he wrote			0
" suddenly the shadow becomes alive			0
" the passage is believed to be a kernel of the " @entity138 , " one of @entity2 's first attempts at a horror mystery			1
the journal offers some surprising insight about the author , too			2
there are funny " memos " that @entity2 wrote to himself , which @entity26 believes were witticisms that the author may have wanted to use at a party or a pub to seem interesting			1
the journal also contains romantic poems			0
" people do n't think of @entity2 as being romantic , but there are some very romantic , sweet moments here , " @entity26 said			1
the author apparently drew from his journal for material that would make up " under the @entity162 , " a lesser - known collection of short stories for children that @entity2 published in 1881			1
one note in the journal alludes to the writer 's fascination with children : " @entity168			2
child goes to sleep & palace grows -- sky changes into blue silk curtains etc. " dreaming kids would appear in several stories in " under the @entity162 , " all darkly told tales that meditate on the blurry line between reality and imagination , science and folklore			0
" @entity2 had a troubled childhood , " @entity26 said			1
" he was very lonely and thought about death a lot during seven years that he was just a boy and struggling through an undiagnosed illness			2
" the journal 's first entry , titled " @entity187 , " is a kind of ode to the sea and the people who encounter it			2
the writing seems experimental and flowery			0
" it 's as if @entity2 were practicing , " @entity2 said			1
" he might have thought , ' well , this is how a writer is supposed to write -- in very long sentences			0
' " the author was fascinated with the theater and the act of observing , and he traveled a lot , a rare thing for his time			0
journaling and touring are central in " @entity96			0
" the novel 's narrator , @entity206 , writes in his journal as he travels across @entity87 , witnessing and questioning the day 's superstitions and trying to make sense of his own bad dreams and bizarre , supernatural encounters			2
the novel centers on @entity17 's attempt to move from @entity215 to @entity5 , and his battle with professor @entity217			2
" @entity2 traveled an unusual amount for the time that he lived , " @entity26 said			1
he loved to ask those questions : what is real and what is myth , and where do they meet ? what is stronger , science or myth ? " though @entity2 died before his @entity17 became internationally famous when @entity229 played him as a suave nobleman in the 1930s film , @entity26 thinks the author would be flattered by how his character has stayed relevant over the years			1
from @entity229 to @entity235 's @entity234 and " @entity236 " to " twilight " and " @entity238 , " @entity2 's main question : " what does it mean to live forever ? " has proved eternal			1
and in true @entity2 style , he left one more mystery			2
in one of his books , the author alludes to another diary			0
he writes about an upcoming trip to @entity248 where one can get work as a writer			0
the journal of writing and notes that was recently found in the @entity16 home is not that diary			1
" there 's something else out there -- that missing piece , this mystery diary , " @entity2 said			2
" i 'm dying to know where it is			0
