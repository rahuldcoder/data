-- the sun is putting on a fireworks show again			0
@entity4 cameras captured images of what the agency is calling at least two " significant " solar flares			1
the first one peaked at 7:42 a.m. et tuesday , followed by a second , lesser blast at 8:52 a.m. et. the short - lived explosions were expected to disrupt high - frequency radio communications on @entity14 , although @entity4 scientists said they pose no threat to humans			1
even with all its power , the sun does n't have enough energy to hurl a fireball 93 million miles at the @entity14			0
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation that send gases , plasma and other matter into the solar system			1
harmful radiation from a flare can not pass through @entity14 's atmosphere to affect humans , but when intense enough , the explosions can disturb gps and communications signals , @entity4 said			1
the first flare was classified as an @entity37 flare , which is unusually bright			0
scientists classify solar flares by size , in much the same way they do tornadoes or earthquakes : x-class flares are the biggest and are major events that can trigger planetwide radio blackouts ; @entity48 - class flares are medium - size ones ; and c - class flares are small , with few noticeable consequences here on @entity14			1
the number after the letter provides more information about a flare 's strength			0
an @entity57 is twice as intense as an @entity58 , an @entity59 is three times as intense , and so on			0
a huge flare can be many times larger than the @entity14			0
the second flare tuesday was classified as an @entity64 flare			0
the images were captured by @entity4 's @entity66 , which typically observes the entire sun 24 hours a day			2
solar flares are not uncommon , as such activity has been increasing in recent years			2
@entity4 has recorded a handful of large - and medium - size flares already in 2014 , although few were as bright as the first one tuesday morning			1
