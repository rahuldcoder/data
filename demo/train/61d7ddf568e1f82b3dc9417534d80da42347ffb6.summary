-- a @entity2 - flagged ship that played a central role in a bloody hijacking drama last spring was attacked again wednesday , a busy day for piracy in the dangerous waters off the east coast of @entity8			1
it was the first time a security team aboard a major merchant ship repelled a pirate attack , a top @entity14 officer said			1
but a defensive weapon that emits a loud noise did not work , vice adm. @entity15 said in a briefing			0
" they tried to employ [ a long - range acoustical device ] and it did not have the effect , " said @entity15 , the commander of @entity19 , which is responsible for the area favored by pirates			2
he said he did not know why the device did not work			0
the @entity27 came under automatic weapons fire from pirates about 350 nautical miles east of the @entity31 coast , the @entity33 's anti-piracy force said , but fought the attackers off			1
the failed attack came on a day of dramatic piracy events : the captain of a ship hijacked monday was confirmed to have died , even as his ship was used to attack another , and a @entity42 prosecutor demanded an investigation into reports that a ransom had been paid for a ship released tuesday			1
the failed attack wednesday targeted the same ship that was hijacked in the @entity49 in april			1
its captain , @entity50 , was held hostage on a lifeboat for five days before @entity14 snipers shot three pirates dead			2
a fourth pirate was arrested , and @entity50 was rescued			0
this time , private security guards on the @entity60 - owned ship fended off the pirates , @entity33 and @entity2 naval sources said			1
security had been beefed up on the vessel since the attack in april , @entity63 spokesman @entity62 told @entity0			1
the ship 's owners did not immediately respond to a @entity0 question about whether @entity50 is still captain of the ship			2
@entity31 pirates vowed revenge for the killing of their compatriots by the @entity14 in april , but it was not immediately clear if the @entity27 was targeted intentionally or if the latest attack was a coincidence			1
no casualties were reported on the ship , but pirates on land in @entity31 feared the pirates who attacked the @entity27 may have been killed or wounded , or may have drowned , they told a local journalist			1
there has been no contact with them since they attacked the @entity27 , a pirate in the central @entity31 town of @entity90 said			2
their last communication came while they were battling the security guards on the cargo ship , the pirate said			0
pirates on land also exchanged gunfire -- with one another			0
they fought among themselves wednesday over a multimillion - dollar ransom they received for releasing a @entity42 fishing boat , said a local journalist in contact with the pirates			1
" there was a heavy exchange of gunfire between some of our friends " one pirate told the journalist , speaking of the other pirates			0
" they fought over the 3 million euro ( $ 4.5 million ) received as a ransom from the @entity42 boat			2

it had been held for 47 days			0
@entity125 did not say how the ship was freed			0
@entity42 media -- including @entity0 sister station @entity0 + , which cited a source it said was close to the negotiations -- reported that a ransom had been paid			1
a top prosecutor in @entity138 on wednesday called for an investigation into the reported ransom			1
@entity142 prosecutor @entity141 sent a written request for the ransom investigation to judge @entity145 , asking that the financial web involved in the alleged payment be untangled , including commissions paid to intermediaries in the negotiations , @entity0 + reported from the courthouse			1
the prosecutor also called on the judge to take testimony from all the ship 's 36 crew members			0
various government ministers have sidestepped questions about whether a ransom was paid , but @entity42 media reported the payment to the pirates totaled $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million			1
a leading @entity42 fishing industry executive , @entity162 , told @entity0 on wednesday that he was certain a ransom was paid for the release of the @entity42 tuna trawler			1
but @entity162 , who heads @entity166 -- a pan-european tuna fishing industry group -- and a @entity42 tuna canning association , said he was n't sure about the amount of the ransom			2
he declined to provide details			0
a day after the hijacking , @entity42 military monitoring the situation captured two pirate suspects as they left the fishing boat and later brought them to @entity138			1
the two were indicted monday on 36 counts of kidnapping and armed robbery			0
they could face sentences of more than 200 years in prison each because of the multiple kidnapping counts			0
separately , the captain of a chemical tanker seized earlier this week died of a wound inflicted during the hijacking , a pirate said			2

it was heading for @entity202 , @entity203 , but was hijacked in the south @entity204 , about 180 miles northwest of the @entity205 , the @entity33 statement said			0
