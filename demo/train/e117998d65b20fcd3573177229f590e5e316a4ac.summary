-- the champagne is on ice , the fireworks are exploding overhead and the guests are getting down to some funky sounds -- but is n't your @entity6 a bit , well , last year ? not everyone spends the last night of december carousing like the dawn will bring a @entity13 apocalypse , yet they still manage to have a great evening			1
so perhaps to see in 2013 , it 's time to pour away the @entity16 , defuse the skyrockets , eject the @entity19 mixtape and take inspiration from some of the planet 's more unusual new year celebrations by adding these to your shopping list : frozen water most parties lay on a few ice cubes for the cocktails , but if you really want your guests to chill , how about a frozen lake , river or sea			1
for some reason , glaciated bodies of water have a magnetic lure for new year revelers undeterred by hypothermia , frostbite or common sense			1
sub-zero soaks are commonplace from @entity44 to @entity45 as swimmers , often fortified by a shot of booze , shiver themselves bluer than the cast of @entity50			2
why you should : an invigorating icy swim will wash away last year 's cobwebs			1
why you should n't : it could also wash away frozen parts of your body			2
underwear after exposing your extremities to such a chilly experience it might be wise to have some thermals to hand , but sensible unmentionables are n't on our list			2
instead , like partygoers in @entity65 and some @entity67 countries you should be thinking about a more dazzling set of drawers			0
in @entity65 , @entity71 and @entity67 and @entity72 , color - coded underpants take on special meaning at @entity6 with red or yellow auguring luck or romance			1
why you should : it 's a chance to liven up your lingerie			0
why you should n't : with all this talk about pants and love you 'll need another icy dip			0
@entity83 sense of humor if you 're fed up with unfunny jokes told by drunken party guests , it 's time to tap into @entity83 's love of deadpan absurdism			1
almost every @entity6 for the past half a century , @entity83 television has broadcast " @entity92 , " a comic @entity94 play in which a sozzled butler imitates party guests to humor his elderly employer			1
the annual repeat of the show 's catchphrase : " the same procedure as last year , " adds to the hilarity and has helped it earn fans in several neighboring countries			1
why you should : the show 's saucy punchline is well worth it why you should n't : the joke takes about 50 years to work properly broken television set when endless reruns of " @entity92 " result in frustration being taken out on your tv , you might be tempted to throw it out of the window in line with a now extinct @entity65 @entity6 tradition of defenestrating unwanted goods			1
a similar habit in @entity123 has seen fridges and other household objects ejected from up high , sometimes resulting in injury and arrest			1
why you should : you should n't			0
why you should n't : it 's illegal , not to mention dangerous			0
grapes there 's nothing too unusual about serving grapes at a party -- unless you follow the traditions of @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 where 12 grapes are consumed on @entity6 , each a symbol of the months that lie ahead			1
in @entity71 the grapes must be eaten in time with the 12 chimes of midnight , which can turn the traditional @entity6 's kiss into a messy business			1
why you should : grapes are a tasty source of anti-oxidants and vitamins			1
why you should n't : inhaling grapes = @entity149			2
molten lead back to @entity83 for another unusual ritual in which a spoonful of lead is melted over a candle then dropped into a bucket of water			1
the shapes formed by the cooling metal are then divined for signs of what lies in the year ahead			2
certain formations have specific meanings : an egg signifies a growing family , a clover means luck and a hat shape means good news			0
no one takes it seriously			0
why you should : it 's fun			0
why you should n't : it 's nonsense			0
pigs in the @entity175 ski resort of @entity176 , the first day of january is celebrated with a piglet race in which 10 tiny porkers sprint through the snow for the enviable prize of being spared from the sausage factory			2
the winner is usually adopted as a town mascot for the year			2
why you should : piglets ! so cute ! why you should n't : the losers get eaten			0
chairs chairs at a party are n't exactly a radical innovation , but in @entity191 they are typically used as a launching pad for people who believe that by leaping into the @entity6 they will banish malevolent spirits			0
why you should : you can claim your new year exercise regime has started early			2
why you should n't : you 'll need the icy water again to bathe those twisted ankles			0
dead birds sailors love a good party , but are notoriously superstitious souls , believing that it is unlucky to begin a voyage on december 31			0
maritime lore also suggests that feathers plucked from a wren slain on @entity207 can protect seafarers from dying in a shipwreck			0
why you should : you polished off those piglets , so a wren is n't going to hurt your conscience			0
why you should n't : nothing kills a party like a dead bird			0
bed @entity218 has a certain reputation when it comes to @entity6 , particularly in @entity44 where @entity222 celebrations -- climaxing in a rendition of the traditional @entity44 song " @entity225 " -- can border on the bacchanalian			1
so it is perhaps a surprise to discover that , according to a survey conducted last year , over a third of @entity218 prefer to be tucked up in bed on the stroke of midnight			1
why you should : you 'll avoid the most overrated party of the year			2
why you should n't : @entity236 corks , fireworks and @entity19 will keep you awake anyway .			0
