@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 brushes her dark brown curls away from her face , nose scrunched up in concentration as she stares at the white board			1
she looks down to write and then pauses , placing her little finger on her chin in contemplation			2
like a typical 7 - year - old , her favorite part about school is the games			2
" @entity17 , " she says in @entity16 , giggling sheepishly			2
" i like hide and seek			2
" but no matter how hard she tries , there are some things this little girl and her friends ca n't hide from			2
" i am scared from the bombs , " she sighs			2
" i am very afraid			2
" read @entity25 's blog entry about the children of @entity0 on @entity27 @entity4 lives in @entity0 , capital of @entity1 's @entity28 , tucked right up against the @entity29 next to @entity27			1
when the @entity1 military began its multiple offensives targeting its own homegrown militant networks in the tribal belt , the retaliation was felt in @entity0			1
it was the residents of this ancient city of 3 million who bore the brunt of an ongoing brutal bombing campaign			2
people 's lives were shattered as the city found itself at the very core of @entity1 's war on terror			1
a truck bomb in a popular marketplace frequented by women and children killed more than 100 people			1
checkpoints sprang up all over the city , meant to instill a sense of security			2
but at the same time they created targets of opportunity as they and government buildings were regularly attacked			0
@entity4 's school is tucked way down an alley off what once was @entity0 's most popular modern market street			1
just out front sits a checkpoint			0
these days her school door remains bolted , the bus drivers act as additional guards and parents are discouraged from coming			0
the school administration wants as few adults loitering around as possible , afraid of suicide bombers			0
but there is little the school can do to keep the children safe from the demons that haunt them			1
" when there is an explosion , " @entity4 says , pausing before she continues , " it feels like the @entity77 are here			0
i imagine corpses are all lying on the ground			0
" her eyes widen and she giggles			0
" she may be laughing , but psychiatrists say it 's deadly serious : the children are confronting a faceless and unknown enemy			1
" the exterior smile is a deception ; it 's the only coping mechanism the child has , " dr. @entity87 , a psychiatrist in @entity88 , says			1
" the child needs counseling , protection , and they are not getting that			0
" the children simply do n't understand why their little world has been affected			1
the problem is , @entity87 explains , the parents can barely cope with the paralyzing fear that defines their lives			1
" the confusion is n't just for the children			1
it 's for the adults , as well			0
the confusion for the adults as to why this is happening , why is this happening repeatedly , it trickles down to the children , " @entity87 says			1
and as those emotions intensify , people look for scapegoats			1
at @entity4 's school we also meet 10 - year - old @entity117			0
we ask her what she likes to do			0
" i like to do painting and i like to ... " she pauses and looks away			0
" but i do n't like @entity121 because she is so bad , and also @entity123			0
" she says it 's what her parents are telling her , explaining that the @entity128 refugees who have lived in the city for decades are n't responsible			0
having children growing up in such an intense and charged atmosphere surrounded by so much violence can have detrimental effects on society			1
" you will have a very insecure population , a population that can be easily polarized , " @entity87 says			0
he says it 's going to take a collective effort from the government , the media and the international community to prevent @entity1 's next generation from being a lost generation materializing into a dysfunctional society			0
but @entity1 's medical services are already stretched to the limit			0
so for the time being , @entity4 and her friends are left to their own devices , trying to survive in a world their elders ca n't even make sense of -- carrying with them the knowledge that each day could be their last .			1

children in @entity0 live with effects of military offensives and militant retaliation
their smiles are how they cope with a faceless and unknown enemy , psychiatrist says
as emotions intensify , people -- *including* the children -- look for scapegoats
