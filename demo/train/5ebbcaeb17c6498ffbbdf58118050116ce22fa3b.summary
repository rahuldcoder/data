-- as @entity3 and @entity4 presidential candidates scour the country for votes during the 2008 campaign , they 'll inevitably court the @entity9 community , a voting group growing rapidly in number and diversity			1
some @entity3 presidential candidates pose before a debate sponsored by @entity15			0
the @entity4 debate was postponed after only one candidate agreed to attend , a development which troubled some party leaders			0
the @entity9 vote is neither homogenous nor loyal to one party			1
though the current political moment seems to favor the @entity3 , experts say that affinity should not be taken for granted			2
the @entity9 community is the fastest - growing minority group in the @entity25 , according to the @entity25 census			1
but its percentage of the electorate is lower than its numbers as a whole because of lower citizenship rates , less voter participation and a youthful demographic			2
of the nation 's more than 44 million people of @entity9 origin , about a third are too young to vote			1
but all that 's changing			0
before the midterm elections in 2006 , the @entity39 , a @entity41 - based think - tank , estimated more than 17 million hispanics would be eligible to vote in that election			2
the number represented a 7 percent increase from 2004			2
the @entity9 share of the @entity25 electorate increased from 8.2 percent to 8.6 percent during the same period , @entity39 estimated			1
that percentage may grow even more by 2008 as a result of citizenship drives , get - out - the - vote campaigns and the natural growth of the community			1
@entity15 , the @entity54 - language broadcast giant , has thrown its considerable weight behind a citizenship drive this year			2
" we feel that empowering our audience is good for @entity9 and the country , " @entity15 president @entity15 told the @entity58 in may 2007 , adding that it was " a totally nonpartisan effort			1
" organizations such as the @entity64 , or @entity64 , are also mobilizing the vote			2
" we have spearheaded a massive naturalization campaign and close to , i think , a million applications will have been submitted this fiscal year , " said @entity64 's executive director , @entity66			0
the change in the electorate could play a significant role in possible swing states like @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 during the 2008 election			1
there 's a reason the @entity3 decided to hold its presidential convention in @entity83 , experts said			0
" i do n't think it 's really registered with people just how influential the @entity9 vote can be in some of these state primaries , " @entity66 said			1
the @entity9 vote has historically been aligned with the @entity3 , an allegiance established during the administrations of presidents @entity91 and @entity92 , said @entity93 of the @entity94			1
that political alignment was further cemented when @entity96 -- designed to deny health care , education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants -- was pushed by @entity4 and passed in @entity101 in 1994			2
but the @entity4 , intent on gaining more @entity9 voters , made inroads during the early parts of this decade , culminating in the 2004 presidential campaign by president @entity107			1
exit polls showed he carried 40 to 44 percent of the @entity9 vote , according to the @entity39			1
" there are a lot of issues that @entity120 agree with @entity4 philosophy , " @entity93 said , pointing to the @entity4 stances on entrepreneurship , fiscal policies , its appeal to @entity9 evangelicals and its policies toward @entity116			1
but the heated immigration debate , when many congressional republicans disagreed with president @entity107 over granting a path toward citizenship for many illegal immigrants , may erode those gains			2
" the republicans are really caught between a rock and a hard place , " @entity93 said			0
they must balance the interests of a segment of their constituency that is very anti-immigrant with the interests of a " @entity9 voter that is affluent and middle class , who can theoretically be reached by @entity4 principles , " he said			1
it is little wonder then , that among @entity4 presidential candidates , only @entity73 sen. @entity143 agreed to appear at an @entity15 debate scheduled for mid-september			0
the debate did n't happen			0
all but one of the @entity3 contenders appeared for their debate			0
some @entity4 leaders said last week not participating in such debates could harm the party 's standing with minority groups for the 2008 election and beyond			2
" what are we going to do -- meet in a country club in the suburbs one day ? " former congressman and @entity4 vice presidential candidate @entity157 told the @entity158			0
" if we 're going to be competitive with people of color , we 've got to ask them for their vote			0
" " this [ political environment ] gives @entity3 a huge advantage , " @entity168 , who heads the @entity169 at @entity170 , said in an e-mail			0
he also runs the @entity174 , a multicultural public relations firm based in @entity41			0
" they are likely to draw far more @entity9 votes than in 2004 and would gain at least a half - million vote advantage " under one of his group 's more conservative scenarios , @entity168 said			1
but the @entity9 community is diverse and voting interests are not homogenous , which imperils such predictions			1
@entity9 immigrants originate from more than a dozen different countries , arrived in the @entity25 through numerous immigration waves and have different perceptions of communal identity , @entity168 said			1
for example , a @entity189 may vote @entity4 because of the @entity4 's long - standing policies toward @entity116 , whereas a @entity193 voter in @entity194 or a voter in a border state may be driven by different motives			0
the culture of a state can also affect a @entity9 voter 's behavior			2
a voter in @entity203 may be more conservative , whereas a voter with a similar background in @entity101 may be more liberal , @entity93 said			0
there may also be generational cleavages , @entity93 said			0
a study he conducted with a colleague on the impact of religion on the @entity9 vote revealed differences between first - , second - and third - generation hispanics			1
the first and third generations said religion was more important to them when compared to the second generation			0
additionally , despite the furor over immigration , that issue might not be the most important to @entity9 voters , @entity64 's @entity66 said			1
" if the election were held today , i think immigration would be a significant factor , but we 're more than a year away from the election , " he said			0
based on a series of town hall meetings conducted in 2004 and conversations throughout this year , @entity66 said education , the @entity232 war , the economy and health care may take precedence over immigration			0
" we need to distinguish issues that matter to the @entity9 community versus the issues that matter to @entity9 voters , " he said			1
" those are not the same			0
