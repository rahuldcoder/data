@entity0 -- in the days before the @entity3 voted to end a filibuster and take up gun control this week , president @entity2 crisscrossed the nation , flying from @entity7 to @entity8 in an effort to energize public opinion and pressure reluctant lawmakers			1
vice president @entity12 also made an emotional plea at the @entity14			1
and even the first lady brought an audience to tears at a high school in @entity19 where gun violence has been felt most painfully			2
but , as a bipartisan group of senators reached agreement on what some have called a watered - down proposal for expanded background checks for gun purchases , the question remains whether all that lobbying really made a difference			1
" it has helped , but it 's sort of a two - part story , " said @entity32 , author of " politics of @entity34 " and chairman of the @entity38 - @entity37 's political science department			0
" part one is the president using the bully pulpit to make news events and congratulate those states where they 've enacted tougher laws			2
there 's a certain downside that anything that @entity2 is for is anything his opponents are against , " @entity32 said			1
as the president spent considerable political capital over the past few days to champion gun reform , opponents have raised the stakes by vocally speaking out against such policies and making it clear there will be a reckoning come @entity61 for any lawmaker who supports them			1
take the president 's fiery comments on monday in @entity65			2
it was a message crafted as much for lawmakers as it was for the families of students and educators killed in december 's school massacre in @entity73 , which is not far from where @entity2 spoke			1
the families sat behind him on stage and traveled to @entity0 with him on @entity78 to lobby @entity79 on gun control			1
" this is not about politics , " the president said to applause			2
" this is not about politics			0
" " this is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let 's make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down			0
" but it is , at least in part , about politics			0
why we 're still debating guns sen. @entity98 , the conservative @entity100 @entity99 and avid gun supporter who helped lead a bipartisan compromise agreement with fellow senator @entity103 , @entity104 , over background checks , was visibly moved after meeting with @entity73 families			2
" i can do something , " an emotional @entity98 told parents who lost children in the attack			0
but when the pair announced their compromise to expand federal background checks to gun shows and internet sales , the executive director of the @entity112 , @entity113 , tweeted the sentiment of many in his organization			2
" may sen. @entity103 experience in 2016 the same as he did to sen. @entity124 in 2010			0
" in 2010 , @entity103 was the more conservative challenger to the late sen. @entity124 in @entity104 's @entity127 senatorial primary			0
@entity124 , who beat @entity103 in a similar , contentious @entity127 primary in 2004 , later switched parties and lost in the @entity131 primary to rep. @entity132 , who then lost to @entity103 in the general election			0
" it means that he ought to be held politically accountable and the way to do it is in the primaries , " @entity113 told @entity1 's @entity134 in a heated exchange , indicating his organization would support a primary challenge to @entity103 when he is up for reelection in 2016			0
the timing of @entity2 's speech in @entity65 preceded the @entity3 's vote clearing the way for consideration of a @entity99 - backed gun control package			1
the @entity147 has not yet decided when or if it will take up a similar bill			2
and the timing of first lady @entity151 's emotional homecoming to @entity19 , speaking wednesday at a luncheon fundraiser for a new initiative seeking to curb youth violence , was not by accident , either			0
she recalled the shooting death of @entity158 , a 15 - year - old who was killed a week after performing in @entity0 during the inauguration in january			0
saying @entity162 " was me , and i was her , " mrs. @entity151 reflected on the opportunities that led her to the @entity14 instead of a similar fate			0
@entity2 was in @entity7 last week , just miles from the scene of last july 's movie theater shooting that left 12 people dead , to push for expanded background checks			1
" i 've come here to @entity171 today because @entity7 , in particular , is proving a model for what 's possible , " @entity2 told the audience			1
@entity7 gov. @entity174 recently signed measures into law that will require universal background checks for gun sales , restrict the size of ammunition magazines and make buyers pay for their own background checks			1
before the @entity7 gun - control vote , @entity12 , who heads the @entity2 administration 's efforts on the issue , called several state lawmakers to underscore the broader national importance of the heated gun control policy debate			1
but those efforts may have backfired , galvanizing pro-gun advocates instead			0
@entity7 gun groups have vowed to help defeat lawmakers in tough districts who supported passing the gun control package			1
" i do n't want to go their cocktail parties			0
i do n't want to make friends			0
i just do n't want them to stop @entity203 of their rights including me and my kids , " said @entity200 , executive director of @entity201			0
his group , as well as pro-gun rights groups and publications , such as @entity211 magazine , have stepped up gun giveaways in states like @entity7 , @entity214 and @entity215 , where tough gun control laws have passed or are pending			1
the @entity217 , the nation 's largest and most powerful gun lobby group , said wednesday that expanding background checks at gun shows " will not prevent the next shooting , will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools			0
" the group 's leaders have also been deeply critical of @entity2 's efforts			2
" president @entity2 should be as committed to dealing with the gang problem that is tormenting honest people in his hometown as he is to blaming law - abiding gun owners for the acts of psychopathic murderers , " the @entity217 said in a statement			1
@entity2 has often said that the fight for new gun control is personal			1
he wiped away tears when reflecting on the @entity73 shooting spree			0
and the president was animated in talking about what he sees as national support for stricter gun control policies			1
however , gun control advocates have worried and polls have shown that in the months following the @entity73 shooting , support for stricter gun laws has waned			1
in that , @entity2 's fierce push to keep the issue up front has been extremely valuable to those seeking stricter gun laws , @entity32 said			1
" it 's an imperative that the president be out front on this issue , " @entity32 said			0
" @entity2 's ability to keep this in the minds of the public paves the way a little more for legislative reforms			2
" @entity1 's @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity2 flew from @entity7 to @entity8 pushing gun control agenda
question centers on whether lobbying has made any difference as @entity3 takes up bill
opponents up pressure on lawmakers to vote against any gun control legislation
@entity2 has often said gun control fight is personal
