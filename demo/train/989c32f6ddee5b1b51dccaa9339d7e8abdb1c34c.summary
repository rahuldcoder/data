-- @entity2 's umpires are all over the news after a spate of , er , questionable calls throughout this postseason			2
despite larger postseason umpiring crews that include two extra umps in the outfield , it feels like an inordinate number of calls have gone the wrong way			2
all of these gaffes have prompted renewed debate about whether baseball should start using instant replay			2
how could umps blow this many calls that are so obvious when viewed in slow motion ? are n't these guys trained professionals ? are they handsomely rewarded ? what do we really know about the men in blue , anyway ? after some spotty officiating in the @entity29 last fall , we did some digging on the officials in the four major sports			1
here 's what we found : they make good money a @entity29 ref can make anywhere from $ 25,000 to $ 70,000 a season , although since most of the games are on sundays , they can also have other jobs during the week			1
( we 'll get to those in a minute			0
) that cash comes with responsibilities , though			0
in addition to relaying the calls to the teams and fans , a ref is also the crew chief , or leader , of the seven - man officiating team that also includes an umpire , a field judge , a back judge , a line judge , a side judge , and a head linesman			1
officials in other sports pull down more loot , but they have much more grueling schedules ... @entity2			0
according to @entity63 , @entity2 umpires get around $ 120,000 when they start out in the big leagues , and senior umps can earn upwards of $ 300,000			1
between spring training , a 162 - game schedule , and the postseason , being an @entity2 ump is a job that takes up most of the year			1
they are , however , well cared - for while on the road			2
each ump gets a $ 340 per diem to cover hotel and food , and when they fly , it 's always first class			2
working a full postseason can tack on an extra $ 20,000 , plus expenses			1
they also get four weeks of paid vacation during the regular season			2
these guys hang onto their jobs , too ; on average , there 's only one opening for a new big league ump each season			1
@entity93 refs are similarly well compensated			1
they earn anywhere from $ 100,000 to $ 300,000 for an 82 - game season			1
there are some nice fringe benefits , too ; when referee @entity97 admitted to helping gamblers fix games , the @entity93 asked that he repay other benefits he 'd pulled in over the course of his 13 - year career , including $ 750 worth of sneakers and $ 4500 worth of free tickets			1
if you can skate and survive the occasional lockout , @entity106 ref is hardly a bad job			2
refs make between $ 110,000 and $ 255,000 while linesmen earn from $ 72,000 to $ 162,000			1
@entity0 : stories behind all 30 @entity106 team names @entity29 refs have day jobs since @entity29 refs only work one day each week , they can have " real " jobs to supplement what they earn on any given sunday			1
some of them actually have pretty interesting jobs			2
@entity120 , my personal favorite ref , is an entrepreneur and inventor who holds eight patents for snow sports apparel			1
he founded and co-owns @entity125 , a ski apparel company			0
@entity126 is infamous in @entity127 for being the ref in the " @entity129 , " but he 's also a fifth - generation dairy farmer who once held the position of president of the @entity132			1
@entity133 became an official in the league in 1996 and got the promotion to referee in 2003			0
prior to becoming a referee , he was better known as dr. @entity138 , a dentist			0
@entity139 is probably used to dealing with unruly crowds of guys from his day job as a high - school social studies teacher			0
if @entity146 seems hard to scare on the field , it 's probably because he 's seen worse			0
he was an @entity148 colonel during the @entity149 , where he was awarded a bronze star			0
@entity0 : what 's with those @entity153 throwback uniforms ? @entity154 is similarly tough ; he spent 27 years as a police officer and firefighter in @entity157			0
@entity159 's not just a ref , he 's also an associate professor in @entity161 's phys. ed. department			0
@entity162 must love how he looks in stripes			0
in addition to being an @entity29 ref , he officiates @entity167 hoops games and has drawn @entity169 assignments in previous seasons			1
and when @entity172 is n't officiating a game ( or working out ) , you might find him in a courtroom			1
he 's a trial lawyer in the @entity176 firm @entity177 , @entity178 , and @entity179 , which employs over 80 attorneys			0
it 's a long climb to the top how does one become a ref ? most of these guys have humble beginnings as officials			0
@entity120 started officiating @entity189 games in 1972 and gradually worked his way up through the college ranks			0
eventually , he became an @entity29 side judge in 1990 and received a promotion to @entity29 referee , the pinnacle of football officiating , in 1995			1
@entity172 started as a @entity189 ref in the early 1970s ; he was a law school student who needed a little extra pocket cash			0
he then slowly made his way up through high school , junior college , and small conference college ball before getting a @entity203 gig			0
he eventually made it to the @entity29 in 1990			2
it 's a slow build , but if you stick it out long enough and have some natural talent , you can be the one patting his head to signal an ineligible receiver downfield			0
still not convinced it 's a tough ride ? in a recent op - ed in the @entity214 , former baseball commissioner @entity212 cited the paltry salaries for minor - league umps : just $ 9500 for a five - month season for junior umpires , and only $ 20,000 a season for guys who have risen all the way to triple a ball			1
