-- dr. @entity1 knows what it 's like to be sought after			2
the @entity5 plastic surgeon -- first made famous by reality show " @entity1 " -- has operated on a range of a-list celebrities ( though he declines to name them )			1
yet even he was unprepared for the clamor that met him when he first visited @entity12 in what was meant to be a one - time gig as a guest surgeon			1
" for that week , i literally had people waiting until 2am for a consultation			2
the waiting room was filled 20 people - deep all day long , " he recalls			2
since , @entity1 has returned to the city every two to three months as part of a partnership with the @entity24			0
over the years , he has enlisted the @entity25 of @entity5 surgeons to join him at the practice			1
" every time i go , i do n't even sit down			0
i 'm running around from 7am until midnight			0
the demand is literally out the door , " he says			0
in the last couple of years , @entity12 has become a nip - and - tuck hub			1
where once residents from throughout the @entity35 would venture to @entity5 , @entity37 or @entity38 for treatments , these days , they 're staying closer to home to have work done			0
" in @entity44 , i 'd say it 's been about a 30 - 40 % drop [ in business ] , " says dr. @entity42 , the national secretary for the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) in @entity44			1
" a lot of surgeons are leaving			1
they 're moving to @entity12 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
these countries are safer and more attractive for plastic surgeons , " he says			1
the @entity57 diamond notes that these days , " there is no paucity of plastic surgeons " in @entity12			1
according to the @entity63 , their membership has jumped from 60 in 2006 to 150 this year			2
in fact , there are more cosmetic surgeons per citizen in the @entity68 than in either @entity37 or the @entity69 -- two nations lauded for their love of the scalpel			2
" the market is very saturated , " notes dr. @entity73 , a plastic surgeon who moved his practice to @entity12 from @entity37 in 2005 who is also on the scientific committee of the @entity63			1
" every day i get emails [ from surgeons ] saying , ' i heard @entity12 is good for business			1
i want to come and visit , do some work , then come back home			0
' everybody thinks @entity12 is this mecca full of rich people			1
they think they 'll come over and find gold on the streets			0
it 's not like that ; it 's hard work , " he says			0
despite the influx , experts say demand for plastic surgery is on the rise			1
according to the @entity101 ( @entity102 ) , in 2012 , medical tourists made up 8.7 % of total health sector revenue , with many seeking cosmetic procedures			2
" the industry is growing very fast , " notes @entity105 , founder of @entity12 plastic surgery consultancy @entity106			1
she says the city 's healthcare market is expected to grow 11.4 % over the next two years			2
a beauty smorgasbord as @entity12 is one of the most multicultural cities in the world ( 200 different nationalities call the emirate home ) , it 's no surprise that surgeons are noticing a broad demographic willing to go under the knife			1
" last year , i saw patients from 73 nationalities , which is a record , " says @entity73			0
though patients come from as far afield as @entity125 and @entity126 , the majority , he says , come from the @entity35 , with many making the trip from @entity128			0
diamond also reports having operated on many @entity128 woman , who traditionally wear a veil in their day - to - day lives			0
" in @entity69 , you 're not exposed to too many people who cover their face , and you assume those who do do n't care about their appearance because they never show it off			0
but once you get to know the culture , you realize they 're not that different from us			0
@entity143 women love looking good just as much as @entity69 women do , " he says			1
and it 's not just women investing in their looks			0
surgeons in the area have reported seeing a growing number of men in their clinics , as well as teenagers ( @entity154 estimates that 15 % of plastic surgery patients in the @entity68 are under 23 )			1
she adds that in her experience , @entity158 patients are often more gung - ho than their @entity162 counterparts			0
" in @entity126 , @entity69 and @entity164 , people will try to adopt their lifestyle first			0
@entity167 , for instance , would be a last resort after you 've tried everything else			0
here , it 's more , ' i 've gained some weight , i 'll get some lipo , ' and they 'll get the treatment four or five times , which is when it becomes dangerous , " she warns			2
part of her job , she says , is discouraging patients from over-indulging in treatments .			0
