@entity0 -- the @entity5 diplomat whose arrest and strip search in @entity0 ignited a diplomatic spat between nations has filed a motion seeking the dismissal of the charges , her attorney said wednesday			1
the diplomat , @entity13 , left the @entity14 last week amid federal charges that she lied on a visa application for her housekeeper			1
a dismissal of the charges against her would allow her to reenter the @entity14 , where her husband and two daughters reside , said her attorney , @entity23			0
a hearing is set for january 31			0
a motion filed in federal court tuesday asked that the case be thrown out , saying the court " does not have jurisdiction over the defendant due to the @entity31 's diplomatic status which provides her absolute immunity from criminal prosecution in the @entity14			0
" because dr. @entity13 was cloaked in diplomatic immunity at the time of her arrest on december 12 , 2013 , as well as the time of the filing of the subsequent indictment on january 9 , 2014 ( on which she was not re-arrested or arraigned ) , she can not be prosecuted thus necessitating a dismissal of the indictment and proceeding , " the motion said			1
@entity14 prosecutors accused @entity13 of lying in a visa application about how much she paid her housekeeper			1
she was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements			1
the @entity5 government denied a request by the @entity57 to waive @entity13 's diplomatic immunity so she can answer the charges , @entity14 and @entity5 officials said			1
the immunity was granted after her controversial arrest			0
@entity13 arrived at the @entity63 airport friday , according to an @entity5 official who was not authorized to speak to the media			1
@entity13 told @entity1 , through an intermediary , that the charges against her " are false and baseless			1
" " i look forward to demonstrating that to all of you , " she said through the intermediary			0
@entity13 " affirmed her determination to ensure that the episode would not leave a lasting impact on her family , in particular , her children , who are still in the @entity14 , " the @entity71 said			2
@entity63 is demanding that @entity78 apologize and have the charges dropped			0
amid the tensions over the case , the @entity14 announced that it will withdraw one official from its embassy in @entity63			0
federal prosecutors allege @entity13 promised in the visa application , under which her housekeeper moved from @entity5 to the @entity14 , to pay her at least the minimum wage in @entity0 , and to require she work no more than 40 hours per week			1
they allege that @entity13 then had the housekeeper , @entity89 , sign a second contract , which set her pay far below the minimum wage and required that she work much longer hours			2
" i would like to tell other domestic workers who are suffering as i did -- you have rights and do not let anyone exploit you , " @entity93 said in a statement released thursday			0
mix of @entity101 legacy and politics ? diplomatic status @entity13 's lawyers have repeatedly said the diplomat is not guilty and is entitled to diplomatic immunity			2
@entity13 " did not make any false statements and she paid her domestic worker what she was entitled to be paid , " her attorney said			1
@entity93 fled the diplomat 's home last summer , and @entity13 started legal proceedings against her and her husband in the @entity5 courts			1
@entity93 has been granted permission to remain in the @entity14			0
@entity23 , @entity13 's attorney , said the diplomat and her legal team were pleased that the @entity57 had done " the right thing " thursday by recognizing her diplomatic status			2
@entity14 officials had previously said @entity13 was entitled to consular immunity , which is less broad than diplomatic immunity and covers only actions carried out under official duties			2
@entity13 was @entity5 's deputy consul general for political , economic , commercial and women 's affairs			1
but after her arrest , @entity5 officials appointed her as counselor at the country 's permanent mission to the @entity136 in @entity0			1
through that post , she was accorded " the privileges and immunities of a diplomatic envoy , " the ministry said			0
two senior @entity14 officials said that the @entity57 had no choice but to grant @entity143 full diplomatic immunity once she was accredited to the @entity136 because she did not pose a national security threat , which is the only reason for which , in very rare cases , immunity is denied			0
when @entity5 refused the @entity14 request to waive the immunity so that she could face the charges against her , she had to leave the country , the officials said			2
debate : arrest , strip - search of @entity5 diplomat ' barbaric ? ' arrest and search @entity5 has expressed outrage about the arrest of @entity13 , who was handcuffed and strip - searched by federal agents on december 12 after a complaint filed by @entity93			1
some observers have suggested that @entity5 officials ' protests and repeated demands for an apology are driven by political concerns			2
secretary of state @entity165 expressed " regret " about the situation last month , but stopped short of saying authorities had done anything wrong			0
@entity14 law enforcement officials have said that @entity13 's strip search was standard procedure and that she received a number of privileges not usually accorded to defendants			1
during the spat , @entity5 authorities removed concrete barriers from outside the @entity179 and took away @entity14 diplomats ' identification cards			0
that was followed recently by an order that the @entity14 shut down " commercial activities " at a recreational facility at the @entity179 in @entity63			0
the @entity14 @entity179 should halt the activities at the property by thursday , an @entity5 external affairs official said last week			2
the property houses a bowling alley , swimming pool and gym			0
