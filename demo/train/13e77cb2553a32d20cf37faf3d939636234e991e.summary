-- a journal written by the 19 - year - old gunman in last week 's @entity4 mall shooting offers no clues to a key question investigators are asking -- whether @entity7 knew the young man and woman he shot and killed before turning the gun on himself			1
while police in @entity13 , @entity4 , are not yet releasing the contents of the journal , they said tuesday that from his writings , it appears @entity7 knew he had mental health issues			1
they did not elaborate on that point			2
but why did he go to @entity22 in @entity23 on saturday and fire as many as nine shots into a skateboard apparel shop ? gunman 's mother says he was ' gentle , sweet ' @entity7 was an avid skateboarder , a friend of his family said			1
as of now , that 's the only known link between him and the skate shop @entity33			2
investigators are distributing fliers with @entity7 's picture to those in and around the mall , in hopes of finding people who either knew him or saw him			1
@entity7 was known to frequent the mall , according to police , where " he would hang outside and smoke in small groups			1
" investigators are also working on retrieving data from @entity7 's computer and cell phone , according to police			1
still , his motive remains a mystery			2
it started out as a routine day in busy mall @entity7 's mother told reporters sunday that her son was a " gentle , sweet kid , " and that she does n't think he knew his victims -- 21 - year - old @entity58 and 25 - year - old @entity59			1
on saturday , a federal official briefed on the shooting told @entity0 that preliminary information suggested the gunman aimed only at @entity58 and @entity59 , perhaps indicating it was an isolated situation and not a wider shooting spree			1
" i know there 's a lot of interest in the motive for this , and i have as much interest in that as anybody , " @entity13 police chief @entity72 said sunday			2
@entity58 was an assistant manager at @entity33			2
she had worked there since november 2012 , according to her @entity76 page			0
friend @entity77 said @entity58 , the mother of a small boy , was " just full of energy			0
" " she was so nice and just an amazing artist and just an amazing person inside and out , " @entity77 told @entity0			0
" she loved her son			0
she loved being a mother , " @entity77 said			0
cops : mall gunman expressed ' general unhappiness ' in journal @entity59 had worked at the store for about three months , according to his @entity76 page			1
five people went to the hospital for treatment after the shooting			1
all were treated and released			0
@entity93 suffered injuries in the chaos after the shooting			0
the other injured victim suffered a gunshot wound to the foot			0
police said the woman was n't in @entity33 ; rather , she was on the first floor when she was hit			0
the mall reopened monday afternoon , but the @entity33 store will be closed indefinitely , according to a sign on the boarded - up storefront			0
the simple thing your mall can do to protect you @entity0 's @entity110 and @entity111 contributed to this report .			0
