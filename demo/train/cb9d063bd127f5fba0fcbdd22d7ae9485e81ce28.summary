but investigators were eventually able to find corresponding e-mails , ip addresses and other communications they linked to @entity111			0
they also tied him to online forums asking about malware , how to control webcams , and hacking into @entity57 accounts			0
investigators also linked him to at least eight other young women -- some of them , like @entity4 , from @entity119 , though others were from as far away as @entity121			1
the victims told authorities similar stories : of a person they did not know saying , and in some cases proving , he had nude images and making demands as a result			2
the stalker claimed to have 1,000 photographs of one woman , the complaint said			0
when she asked , " why are you doing this to me ? " the response was , " i told you i 'll answer any questions after you @entity83			0
" as an @entity13 agent was speaking by phone to this young woman , she logged onto her @entity144 account to find it populated by nude pictures of her , the complaint said			2
a few young women apparently complied with the demands for a @entity83 session			0
the man promised not to record the sessions and he made it look like he was erasing the nude pictures of them			0
one such session was found on the suspect 's phone , police said			2
