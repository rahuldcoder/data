@entity0 , @entity1 -- a large crane used to load and unload containers from cargo vessels , was bent , twisted and leaning toward the water at the main port for @entity1 's capital city on thursday			1
roads leading toward the city from a dock normally used for offloading ships were impassable , buckled about 5 feet high by tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake			2
three vessels loaded down with medical supplies , food , clothing and water for earthquake victims had nowhere to dock and offload , according to a @entity21 shipping company who provided them			0
meanwhile , so many aid planes had landed at the @entity0 's airport that a bottleneck was created , and space to unload aid items was at a premium			2
some planes were held in the air because there was no space to land and unload them			0

" " the aid is coming now and getting to the @entity0 airport			2
and it 's not getting out , because of the road system			0
" he said he hoped the @entity44 and other nations would bring in equipment to help clear the roads			0
in addition , he said , the airport was overcrowded			0
" and that is due , probably , to the fact that the control tower fell ... but we understand that the @entity44 , especially the @entity64 , was putting up an emergency control tower			2
" @entity1 continues search for survivors @entity69 spokesman @entity68 said thursday afternoon that @entity44 military air traffic controllers were running @entity0 's airport , per an agreement with the @entity21 government			1
