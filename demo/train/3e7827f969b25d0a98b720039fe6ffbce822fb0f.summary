-- @entity1 sat down heavily on a neighbor 's porch , somewhere in between her front door and her good friend 's driveway			1
the distance between the two was less than half a mile			1
it might as well have been 20			1
she had already taken a break on a tree stump near the road			1
this was the last stop , she told herself as she stood up from the porch slowly			2
she was going to make it			2
reaching her friend 's house was like reaching the finish line of a much longer race			2
" i was just like i had run in a marathon , " @entity1 remembers			1
" it was the biggest moment in my life			2
" " he had to bring me home because i could n't walk back , " she laughs , " but ... " but the victory was sweet for a woman who just six months before had primarily relied on a wheelchair to get around , a woman who had lived in her house for two years without walking to the mailbox			1
at her heaviest in march 2011 , @entity1 weighed 428 pounds			1
" i could no longer participate in life 's activities and was forced to become a spectator while people around me lived their life , " she wrote on @entity32			2
" today , i am 276 pounds lighter , 14 jean sizes smaller , and no longer need a wheelchair , walker or cane to get around			1
i am a walking , talking miracle and have been given a second chance at life			2
" @entity1 's father died when she was 8			1
friends and family showed their sympathy with food			2
the lunch lady at school put extra fries on her tray ; the neighbors gave her more candy at @entity57			2
her grandparents were caterers , and their extended family got together often for exorbitant meals			2
" i learned at a very young age that food makes the happy times better and the sad times more bearable , " she says			2
she was heavy throughout high school and college but says her weight never really affected her life until 2003 , when a series of setbacks sent her into a downward spiral			2
@entity1 lost her church job of 15 years and moved more than 200 miles to start anew			1
she lost her grandfather and best friend back - to - back a few months later			2
then her new job was cut from the church 's budget			1
" all of a sudden i 'm 42 years old , living alone , unemployed , no income whatsoever , " she says			1
so she comforted herself with food and decided to go back to college			2
professor @entity81 was n't surprised by @entity1 's amazing transformation			1
she caught his attention right away as a student willing to work hard			2
" i already knew she was dedicated , " @entity81 says			2
" i think starting over as a college freshman had to be a challenge -- almost just as impressive			2
" over the next four years , @entity1 gained weight steadily			1
her doctor diagnosed her with rheumatoid arthritis , an extremely painful chronic disease that inflamed her joints			0
the extra pounds she was carrying only made the condition worse			0
she used a walker or cane to get around			0

by january 2011 , " my life was in complete chaos , " @entity1 says			1

" i could barely function , " @entity1 says			1
she got up , rode around in her wheelchair , popped painkillers , ate and went to bed every night at 7 p.m. " every bit of energy i had went to just living			1
" her wake - up call came on march 1 , 2011			0
her sister phoned to tell her she was getting bariatric surgery			0
@entity1 pleaded with her not to -- she had heard horror stories about the procedure 's aftereffects			1
when the sister hung up , @entity1 went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of peach soda			1
" something just clicked in my head , " she says			0
a quick calculation made @entity1 realize she had been drinking nearly 7,000 calories a week in soda -- the equivalent of 2 pounds			1
she opened up the bottle and dumped it down the drain			0
then she did the same with the rest of her stash			0
at that moment , @entity1 gave up sugar cold turkey			1
ten days later , she went to the doctor and had lost 7 pounds			0
she bought a calorie - counting book on the way home and started reading food labels			0
soon after , she restricted her calorie intake to 1,000 calories a day ( experts warn against eating less than 1,200 calories a day because it sends your body into starvation mode )			1
she says she was n't hungry at that limit because of her lack of mobility			0

almost a year later , she showed up in @entity81 's office doorway			0
he never heard her coming			0
" there 's a chance we may have done a little dance in the hall , " he says with a laugh			0
" to see somebody walk again ? i considered that miraculous			0
" every time she lost 20 pounds , @entity1 went to the store and bought a pair of pants in the next size smaller			1
they sat in the corner of her room until she could pull them on			0
they were her motivation when she was tempted to cheat			0
to celebrate losing 200 pounds , she bought a black and white diamond ring			0
she wears it every day as a reminder never to go back			0
" the first row of black diamonds is the first 100 pounds , the second row is the second 100 pounds , " she says			0
