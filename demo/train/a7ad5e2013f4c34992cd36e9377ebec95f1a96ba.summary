the first thing to remember about federal government shutdowns is that they do not matter very much			1
history does not now recall the three @entity5 - led shutdowns during the @entity7 administration over using @entity8 dollars to fund abortions , even though their combined 28 days will almost certainly dwarf the @entity10 of october 2013			2
even the most famous modern shutdown , the 21 - day @entity13 / @entity12 standoff of 1995 - 96 , had effects that were felt most acutely by comparatively well - off federal workers , not their taxpayer bosses			2
a recent @entity24 summary of that event included among its headline impacts stuff like " @entity27 was unable to issue a new standard for lights and lamps that was scheduled to be effective january 1 , 1996 , possibly resulting in delayed product delivery and lost sales			0
" probably the worst thing back then was that passports for @entity30 and visas for foreigners went unprocessed for three weeks , taking a temporary bite out of the tourism industry			0
so when president @entity36 says the shutdown will " throw a wrench into the gears of our economy " and put " the @entity30 people 's hard - earned progress at risk , " it is appropriate to treat such claims with skepticism			1
as we saw during the run - up to the march 1 sequestration trims in federal spending , politicians are incentivized by self - interest and unconstrained by shame in maximizing the hyperbole about what may happen if their ability to collect and redistribute our money is impeded even a little bit			2
none of this , however , means that the shutdown is good politics			1
on that score , all recent public opinion research is unanimous : it is n't			0
as a @entity73 poll released tuesday concluded , " @entity30 voters oppose 72 - 22 % @entity68 shutting down the federal government to block implementation of the @entity71 , or @entity71			1
" all summer and early fall , republicans have played a good political hand badly			1
@entity30 do n't like federal spending levels , do n't like increasing the debt ceiling unaccompanied by spending cuts , are souring on president @entity36 and continue to be lukewarm at best toward his signature legislative accomplishment			1
this would suggest broad political support for keeping day - to - day federal spending levels ( at most ) as is , attaching some cuts to the inevitable debt - ceiling increase , and using the october 1 rollout of the @entity71 as a teaching moment toward crafting policy and politics for legislative reform and eventually replacing it			1
instead of focusing on those popular means to achievable ends , @entity74 spent this political season attempting a hail mary pass with a broken throwing arm			1
trying to defund @entity71 through deadline negotiations in the @entity98 is not only massively unpopular , but — even according to some of the most influential backers of the project — probably doomed from the start			1
it appears unlikely at this writing that our latest government shutdown will end with much more than a relatively insignificant medical - device tax tweak to go along with yet another budgetary can - kicking exercise			2
by that time , it is plausible to assume , public opinion toward @entity74 negotiators will have further eroded , making it harder to get debt - ceiling concessions			2
everyone , everywhere , will declare the whole sorry episode bad for @entity30			0
but is it really ? despite the soul - killing grotesqueness of divided - government brinkmanship , there are some potential upsides even to this dreary saga , particularly for those of us who prefer our government limited			0
for starters , closing down @entity126 provides one of the only occasions to have a national discussion of what is and is not " essential " government work			1
at a time when entitlements , pensions and debt service will be swallowing ever - larger slices of the budgetary pie at all levels of government for as far as the eye can see , this is an exercise we 'll all soon have to master			0
shutdown politics from 2011 and earlier this year also produced something many people thought they 'd never see : a year - over - year trim in @entity149 spending signed onto by the @entity74			1
as sen. @entity151 , @entity152 , has observed , you can not hope to limit the size of government if you do not also find some military spending to cut			2
sequestration was the first in what will have to be many more such steps			0
even the maddening and deeply irresponsible budgetary governance by continuing resolution has produced a desirable result through undesirable means : an effective flat - lining of government spending			2
( or as the @entity168 's @entity167 puts it , " the federal government in the past two years has been wasting money at a slower rate			1
" ) so , you do n't have to squint too hard to see some positive side - benefits of @entity126 dysfunction			0
but that does n't make it any less desultory			0
this year , for the first time since 2009 , both the @entity173 and the @entity98 fulfilled their legal requirement in passing an annual budget			0
it 's long since time to supplement this minimal stab at responsibility with the legislative next step : a conference committee to hash out a compromise for consideration from the president			0
if our federal government must careen from crisis to crisis , the least it can do is push the deadlines out to every 12 months			0
there are too many actually interesting things going on in this country to waste our energy watching professional hucksters argue over our money .			0

@entity199 : government shutdowns have n't mattered much in past , nor will this one
he says it 's been bad politics for @entity74 , which played a good political hand badly
he says @entity74 spent energy on @entity71 instead of focusing on spending issues
@entity199 : but shutdown does open welcome discussion on what 's " essential " spending .
