-- we are losing in @entity2 , on two fronts			2
the most important center of gravity of the conflict -- as the @entity7 well recognizes -- is the @entity9 public			1
and now , most @entity9 are opposed to the war			2
for years , @entity2 was " the forgotten war , " and when @entity9 started paying attention again -- roughly around the time of president @entity16 's inauguration -- what they saw was not a pretty sight : a corrupt @entity2 government , a world - class drug trade , a resurgent @entity7 and steadily rising @entity9 casualties			1
many surely thought : did n't we win this war eight years ago ? @entity9 , of course , hate seeing the deaths of fellow citizens in combat , but even more they hate to see those deaths in the service of a war they believe they are either not winning or maybe even losing , which is one of the reasons why they largely turned against the @entity37 war in 2006			1
within a couple of years , @entity37 came back from the brink and started to turn around , after which the war there became largely a nonissue for most @entity9			2
similarly , the @entity9 public would be more likely to tolerate the losses of blood and treasure in @entity2 if they saw real progress being made there			1
and right now , they do n't			0
the second front we 're losing is the @entity2 themselves , who are the @entity9 ' center of gravity in the @entity2 war			1
eight years into this conflict , @entity9 and its @entity58 allies -- who are still looked on favorably by a majority of @entity2 -- are not providing large swaths of the @entity2 population with the most basic public good , which is security			1
it 's time to table fancy counterinsurgency doctrines about " connecting the @entity2 people to the government " -- @entity2 have never had , and do n't expect much , in the way of services from their government , and it 's time now to focus on something much more basic : security			1
the last government to provide @entity2 with real security was ... the @entity7			1
when they ruled the country before 9/11 , security came at a tremendous price : a brutal , theocratic regime that bankrupted the country and was a pariah on the world stage			0
but in the context of @entity2 history , the @entity7 bringing security was decisively important , since what had immediately preceded their iron rule was a nightmarish civil war during which you could be robbed or killed at will by gangs of roving ethnic and tribal militias			1
it is has been a staple of @entity96 political theory since the mid- 17th century , when @entity97 wrote " @entity98 , " that if the state does not provide security to its people , life will be " nasty , brutish and short			1
" @entity97 wrote " @entity98 " in the shadow of the @entity104 , deriving from that bloody conflict the idea that the most important political good the state can deliver is security			2
the @entity9 relearned this lesson in @entity37 with some success starting in 2007			0
but the @entity9 seems to have developed instant amnesia about this issue in @entity2 , where around 40 percent of the country was controlled by the @entity7 or was at high risk for attacks by insurgents , according to a private assessment prepared by the @entity2 military in april , which was obtained by @entity0			1
a glaring symbol of the collapse of security in the country is the 300 - mile @entity125 - to - @entity126 highway , economically and politically the most important road in the country , which is now too dangerous to drive on			0
who will then provide security ? the @entity2 army is relatively small and generally ineffective			1
the plans to ramp up the size and efficacy of those forces are , of course , a key part of the @entity9 exit strategy from the country			0
but that training mission is going to take years			0
nor are @entity58 allies going to add significantly more troops			0
indeed , a number of @entity58 countries are already heading to the exits			0
that means that it now falls to the @entity9 to do the heavy lifting in @entity2 , and if @entity16 is serious about securing the country and rolling back the @entity7 , he really does n't have much choice but to put significant numbers of more troops on the ground			1
that way , he can start winning the war : win back the @entity9 public , roll back the @entity7 -- who have melded ideologically and tactically with @entity160 -- and provide real security to the @entity2 people			1
such a ramp - up will have an additional benefit			0
in the larger war on @entity160 and its allies , the center of gravity is the @entity169 public , military and government because it is in @entity169 where @entity160 and its @entity7 allies are headquartered			1
and in one of the most important strategic shifts since 9/11 , the @entity169 military and government are now getting serious about wiping out large elements of the @entity7 and allied groups on their territory and , most importantly , are doing it with the support of their population			0
no longer are @entity169 military operations against militants in @entity185 and @entity186 seen by @entity169 as " @entity9 's war " : they are now seen as being in the vital interests of the @entity169 state because the @entity169 @entity7 and other jihadist groups have made major strategic errors since early 2009 , including marching close to @entity192 , attacking @entity169 's equivalent of the @entity194 and killing hundreds of @entity169 soldiers and policemen			1
this new development is vitally important			0
over the years , @entity9 military commanders have often talked about hammer and anvil operations in eastern @entity2 and western @entity169 that would bring an @entity9 hammer down on the militants based along the @entity2 - @entity169 border , who would then in turn be caught on a @entity169 anvil			2
in reality , the @entity9 hammer was never large and the @entity169 anvil was never strong			0
but the ongoing @entity169 military incursion into @entity186 , which was preceded by months of " softening up " operations with air strikes and artillery as well as a ramped - up @entity9 drone program aimed at @entity160 and @entity7 leaders there , is today setting the conditions for a real anvil			2
the hammer must now be applied			0
armed groups do n't sue for peace when they believe they might have the upper hand , and right now , the @entity7 feel that they are winning the war -- or at least not losing it , which for most insurgencies amounts to the same thing			2
if there is to be some kind of political reconciliation with elements of the @entity7 , that will only come once they truly believe they have no prospect of military success			0
at the same time , key roads , cities and towns in @entity2 must also be secured			0
without providing that security , as @entity97 wrote three and half centuries ago , governments of any kind will fail at their most basic task			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 .			0

@entity239 : most @entity9 now oppose the war in @entity2
he says @entity9 , @entity2 government do n't provide basic security
@entity97 said life in nations without security is " nasty , brutish and short "
@entity251 : @entity16 has to add troops if he is serious about repelling @entity7
