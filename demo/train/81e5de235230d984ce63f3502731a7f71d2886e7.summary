-- @entity2 's defense of the @entity4 title was dealt another hammer blow saturday as @entity7 ' slumping side were beaten 1 - 0 by @entity8 at @entity9			1
it was the second home defeat for @entity8 in three days and their fifth of a sorry campaign , as many as they suffered all last season in winning their record 20th @entity16 championship			2
trailing leaders @entity19 by 12 points before the lunchtime kick off , @entity8 remained in ninth place while @entity8 , winning at @entity9 for the first time in 41 years , moved up to sixth place ahead of the afternoon program			1
@entity27 's goal just after the hour mark sealed three points for the visitors , the highly - rated @entity32 scoring after a cut back from @entity34			1
missing the suspended @entity36 , the home side created few opportunities although @entity38 hit the post with a header before the @entity8 breakthrough			2
@entity43 striker @entity42 , back after injury , had a late effort ruled out for offside and substitute @entity46 shot narrowly wide , but @entity48 's battlers held out comfortably enough			0
@entity7 , who took over from @entity49 in the summer , refused to accept that their title challenge was over at this stage of the season , but admitted his team were in a " transitional period			0
" " i stand firm that we 'll be very close to it and i hope we 're in and around it when it comes to the end of the season , " he told @entity56			0
he also asked for patience from the @entity8 fans , so used to continuous success under the legendary @entity49			2
" i think they understand it 's the same players which were here last year as well			0
obviously the manager 's changed , so we 'll work , we 'll try and improve and try and get better			0
" @entity8 did look to be turning the corner with a 12 - match unbeaten run ahead of wednesday 's 1 - 0 defeat to @entity7 ' former club @entity74			1
@entity36 , so missed saturday , starred in a 5 - 0 win over @entity76 which took them into the last 16 of the @entity78 , but their @entity4 form has been inconsistent			1
@entity19 can open a 15 - point gap over @entity8 if they beat @entity81 and could take heart from the results of their nearest challengers later saturday			2
@entity86 slipped to a shock 3 - 2 defeat at struggling @entity89 with on - loan @entity91 winger @entity90 grabbing the odd goal in five winner in the final minute			1
@entity95 's side looked set for a point after @entity97 completed a double either side of goals from @entity100 and @entity101 , but @entity90 hit the winner with a sublime strike at the death			0
@entity105 also missed the chance to close up , held 1 - 1 at @entity107 after taking a 10th - minute lead through @entity109			1
but @entity110 grabbed the equalizer for the @entity107 before halftime			0
@entity91 took advantage of the slip ups to go above @entity86 into second place on goal difference with a 4 - 1 home win over @entity118			1
the struggling @entity118 did not help their cause by scoring two own goals and having captain @entity121 sent off in the second half			0
the outstanding @entity123 scored his 14th goal of the season in the impressive win			0
@entity127 secured their second away win in a week in the late game at @entity130 , emerging 2 - 1 winners to take close order in sixth .			2

@entity2 beaten 1 - 0 by @entity8 at @entity9
@entity27 goal on the hour mark seals *victory*
