" " this is a meaningless step -- legally and in practice -- and an action that creates an unnecessary confrontation with the international community at a time when we are making an effort to persuade elements in the international community to reach a better deal with @entity33			1
at this time , the attention of the international community must not be diverted from the main effort -- preventing @entity33 from receiving an agreement that will allow it to continue its military nuclear program			0
