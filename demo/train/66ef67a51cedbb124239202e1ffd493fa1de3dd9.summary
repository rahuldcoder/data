prosecutors maintain that @entity6 psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they were n't feeling well , contributing to their deaths			1
" you ca n't walk out when you 're in an altered state			0
you ca n't walk out when your capacity to make decisions is taken away from you , " said @entity122 , @entity94 's cousin			1
" everything conducted that week was to make sure people fell in line ... their ability to make rational decisions was taken away from them			1
" defense attorneys dispute that			2
