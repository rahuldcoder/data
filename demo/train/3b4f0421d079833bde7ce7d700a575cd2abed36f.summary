in @entity16 , only one semester of physical education is required for high school students , and middle school students can have a parent waive the regular class			2

@entity2 's solution was fit - @entity76			2
with grant money , she converted classrooms in her local high schools into minigyms			2
these labs contain traverse climbing walls , gaming stationary bikes and virtual group fitness instructors			2

we also have to teach kids how to move , " he says			0
" if we expose children to these environments that are rich in opportunities to be physically active , they 're going to be more physically active as adults			0
" @entity104 rated highly the programs that incorporated movement into minibreaks throughout the school day			2
" many people look at this from the neck down , and they look at all the physical benefits			2
but when we 're talking about kids in school , we also have to look at the neck up			0
kids who are engaged in physical activity are better learners			1
" another finalist , the @entity138 , @entity135 ' " just move " program in @entity136 and @entity137 , added five - minute breaks into students ' daily routine while addressing another obstacle in the fight to add physical activity in schools : how to avoid taking away classroom time			1
the " just move " program uses exercise flashcards that are linked to a grade 's curriculum			1

in fifth grade , they learn the difference between perpendicular and parallel lines while doing squats or talk about camels while doing the camel yoga pose			0
