president @entity1 's new budget includes a mixed bag of tax reforms , including progressive proposals to create a fairer income tax , as well as misguided corporate giveaways			1
on the individual side , he would increase taxes on the very wealthiest @entity10 to pay for tax cuts for lower - and middle - income @entity10 , including limiting tax benefits of itemized deductions for the best - off @entity10 , scaling back gigantic tax breaks for capital gains and large estates , and ensuring that hedge - fund managers pay their fair share			2
each of these steps would reduce glaring inequities in our tax laws that allow the @entity25 of the world to pay lower tax rates than their secretaries			0
on the tax - cutting side , @entity1 would expand tax credits for child - care and education expenses , boost the earned - income tax credit for childless workers , and give a new tax break to two - earner couples			1
critically , these tax cuts would be paid for by the loophole - closers already mentioned			0
unfortunately , these sensible proposals are almost certainly dead on arrival in the @entity42 - led @entity41			1
but on the corporate side , the president 's plans actually have a chance of being taken seriously by congressional @entity42 â€” possibly because his ideas are more in line with the ideological push for lower corporate tax rates			1
the president 's plan would impose a one - time 14 % tax on the $ 2 trillion in untaxed income that multinational companies collectively have stashed in tax havens			1
while 14 % is certainly higher than the single - digit rate companies such as @entity59 and @entity60 have paid to date on their offshore cash , it 's still a lot less than the 35 % these companies should be paying on their profits , and it 's less than what many other businesses are already dutifully paying			0
members of @entity41 have made similar proposals , including sens. @entity70 and @entity71 , who recently proposed taxing foreign profits at 6.5 %			0
put another way , the president and lawmakers ' theory on taxing offshore profits appears to be " getting something is better than nothing			0
" but we can do better			0
in the wake of a titanic debate last year over what should happen to the corporate tax rate , @entity1 's budget is equally notable for failing to include a comprehensive proposal to eliminate tax giveaways			1
the president has said that he wants a revenue - neutral corporate tax change that collects the same amount of revenue by lowering the corporate tax rate while eliminating loopholes			2
but his budget proposal is silent on how to accomplish this goal			0
the goal of corporate tax reform should be raising more revenue , not the same amount			1
measured as a share of the economy , the @entity10 corporate tax is lower than almost every other developed nation -- and our corporate tax collections are at nearly their lowest point since @entity107 this decline has been driven by rampant tax avoidance by big multinational corporations			2
@entity111 released a report which found that 111 @entity114 corporations have found a way to pay zero corporate income taxes in at least one of the last five years despite being consistently profitable			0
and more than 70 % of the @entity114 companies now have subsidiaries in foreign tax havens			0
all of which makes it even more absurd that president @entity1 would reward these tax dodgers with a special low tax rate on their foreign cash hoard			2
there is some good in the president 's tax reform proposal			1
in particular , the low - income tax credits will encourage work and pull millions of workers out of poverty			2
unfortunately , it is hard to imagine these ideas receiving a real hearing this year			0
but the president 's plan to lower the corporate tax rate and reward companies that stash their profits offshore with a lower tax rate -- coupled with his budget 's lack of detail on a road map to eliminating corporate loopholes -- signals there is fertile ground for compromise that would fail to achieve a fair and sustainable corporate tax .			1

@entity155 : @entity1 's progressive plans to create a fairer income tax wo *n't* get through @entity42 - led @entity41
but the president 's proposals for corporate tax reform may *fly* , maybe because they go easy on corporations
