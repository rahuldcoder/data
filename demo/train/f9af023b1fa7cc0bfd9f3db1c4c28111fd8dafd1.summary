-- a @entity2 - based coal company was the victim of a hoax tuesday after activists set up a fake website saying the company would offer free , custom - branded inhalers to children			1
a press release supposedly from @entity11 said it was creating a new public health initiative " designed to combat the stigma of asthma among @entity16 children			1
" under the so - called " @entity20 " initiative , the false statement said , the inhaler actuators would be given to children living within 200 miles of a coal plant , along with coupons good toward purchase of asthma medication			1
" earlier today , an activist group released a ' spoof ' website claiming to be sponsored by @entity11 , " the real company said in a statement			1
" the site is in fact a hoax , making inaccurate claims about @entity11 and coal			1
" a group called @entity20 is killing kids issued a claim of responsibility for the hoax , calling itself " an environmental and public health group that aims to challenge @entity43 's expensive lobbying against sensible updates to the @entity45			1
" the actual @entity11 , based in @entity46 , said in its statement , " @entity11 is proud to help hundreds of millions of people live longer and better through coal - fueled electricity			1
a growing collection of studies demonstrate the correlation between electricity fueled by low - cost coal and improvement in health , longevity and quality of life			1
" government statistics show that coal use in the @entity16 has more than tripled in the past several decades , while regulated emissions have declined 84 % , the company said			2
" @entity11 is a global leader in clean coal solutions and is advancing more than a dozen clean coal projects around the world , leading to our ultimate goal of near - zero emissions from coal			1
" but @entity20 is @entity75 said that @entity11 is " lobbying ferociously against new pollution standards for power plants proposed by the @entity78 , standards the agency says will prevent 120,000 cases of childhood asthma each year in the @entity16			1
" a @entity11 spokeswoman did not immediately return a call or an e-mail from @entity0			1
the hoax press release said children could choose from a variety of youth - themed inhaler cases , " from tween faves like ' the @entity87 ' and ' @entity88 , ' to the ' @entity89 ' and ' @entity91 ' inhalers for older , style - conscious youth			1
there 's even ' my first inhaler ' for tots			2
" the hoax statement included a " quote " from real - life @entity11 chairman and ceo @entity101 , saying , " our actions are guided by a single mission : to be a leading worldwide producer and supplier of balanced energy solutions , which power economic prosperity and well - being			1
@entity20 brings this mission to life , empowering children everywhere to take control of their destinies , beginning with their own lungs			2
" the fake statement pointed readers to the " @entity20 " website			1
" we at @entity11 want to make asthma - related bullying a thing of the past , " says the site 's @entity118 asked @entity121 section			1
" ... kids should never be ashamed of having asthma -- after all , many of their classmates likely have it as well			0
" " @entity20 is a $ 7 billion per year industry , producing more than half of all @entity16 electricity , " the site says			0
" we know we ca n't do this without you , the consumer , and especially without your children , who will continue consuming coal long after you 're gone			2
we depend on your children 's mental well - being and goodwill			2
" the site also offers a kids ' section , where a word - search puzzle features words like " sickness , " " propaganda " and " lies			0
" the phony press release listed a contact name and number at the bottom			0
callers to the number reached a recording identifying it as the " communications and investor relations department			0
" coal is killing kids said in its statement that it worked with the @entity161 , a project of @entity163			2
the @entity163 says on its website it aims to impersonate " big - time criminals in order to publicly humiliate them			0
our targets are leaders and big corporations who put profits ahead of everything else			0
" asked whether the group is concerned about potential consequences , @entity175 , a spokeswoman for @entity20 is killing kids , told @entity0 on tuesday , " we 're really not			1
most companies just leave it alone			0
they 're just worried about their public image , and they do n't want to look like the bad guys			0
" she said the attention surrounding the hoax has been " quite interesting			0
" " we 're very passionate , just because we know there are millions of people out there with sick kids , and we know the coal companies are getting away with this and they want families to pay the price , " @entity175 said			2
in the @entity20 is killing kids statement , @entity175 said , " people may laugh at our sick jokes , but they also understand the real health impacts of burning coal			1
that 's exactly what the coal industry does n't want people to think about , because if enough of us were aware of it , we would shut down these plants once and for all			2
" tuesday 's hoax statement was posted on the spoof @entity20 website and appeared to have been distributed by @entity210			1
but " @entity210 did not issue the hoax release , " said @entity210 spokeswoman @entity211 in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" it appears that whoever is behind setting up the spoof website also posted that hoax release on the site and added @entity210 's name to the release			1
" in this digital age , such hoaxes are becoming more common , said @entity223 , senior faculty for ethics at the @entity225 , an independent school with a focus on educating journalists			0
" a fake press release is actually a fairly unsophisticated way of getting out information , " she said			0
" but building a website to support it allows you to bypass the middleman , the media , and go right to the consumer , and so it 's a lot easier nowadays to get out information that is deliberately distorted			2
" she noted that more than 3,000 people had recommended the fake website on @entity241			1
" this is pretty elaborate , and people are definitely going to be fooled by this , " she said			0
but , she added , " people get tricked every day on the internet			0
... i do n't know that people are that alarmed about it anymore , which is what 's really scary			0
" last month , @entity163 put out a hoax press release saying that @entity252 would pay a $ 3.2 billion tax refund to the @entity254			0
and the @entity16 @entity255 sued the group over an october 2009 hoax press release and fake press conference staged at the @entity259 , claiming the @entity255 had changed its position on climate change legislation and would support cap - and - trade legislation introduced by @entity263 in the @entity264			2
" coal is just an outdated technology , " @entity175 said tuesday			0
" it 's something we started using in the 19th century			0
... nobody ever caught asthma from a solar panel			0
" @entity0 's @entity272 contributed to this report .			0

the spoof was *engineered* by a group concerned about kids ' health
@entity11 says it 's " a global leader in clean coal solutions "
the fake website says @entity11 will give free inhalers to children
