@entity1 , @entity0 -- a glimpse of something shiny on the ocean floor nine years ago led a @entity7 diver to uncover a piece of local history that had been forgotten for more than a century			1
the silver pocket watch was found off the @entity12 coast in @entity7			1
diver @entity13 was exploring a shallow shipwreck off the @entity12 coast in april 2000 when he noticed the object embedded in sediment			1
he thought at first that he had found a coin , but he found it was actually an intact silver pocket watch , still bearing the inscription of its owner			2
@entity13 said he was determined to trace the history of the watch , believing such a prized object deserved to belong to family members or a local museum			1
but that led @entity13 on a nine - year search with lots of dead ends and few leads			2
now , months after enlisting the help of a local researcher , @entity13 has finally tracked down a family member and will be presenting the watch to him next week			2
" i 'm very happy and satisfied that we found out who he was , " @entity13 told @entity2 by phone wednesday			0
" it sort of brings the story to a close			0
it 's quite rewarding that it has n't just sat in the back of somebody 's garage			0
" the watch inscription reads " @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , 1866			1
" that was the only information @entity13 had to go on for most of the past nine years ; even the name of @entity49 's ship was a mystery at the time			1
over the years , @entity13 searched records in person and online , contacting everyone from county records offices to @entity63			0
nothing turned up any information about @entity49			1
" it becomes a bit of a bug , really , " @entity13 said			0
" it 's hard to describe			0
if you find something like that -- it 's a very personal item , and one of my biggest bugbears is if somebody pulls something off a shipwreck and it just sits in the back of their garage			0
" it 's just a lost opportunity and it 's tragic when that happens , that history is just put in a corner , " @entity13 said			1
" you 're obligated to find something out about it			0
it 's your duty to do it			0
" earlier this year , out of frustration , @entity13 said he turned his attention again to the place name inscribed on the pocket watch , @entity50 , a coastal town in @entity51			0
" i just kept doing searches on @entity96 to find out whether any historical societies at all had any information on it , " he said			0
that led @entity13 to a couple that runs the web site for a nearby village , @entity104 , and they put @entity13 in touch with researcher and historian @entity107			0
@entity107 searched the graveyards of local churches and found two references to @entity49			2
he also found a reference to @entity49 on the @entity114 ' web site , showing that @entity49 was captain of an iron - clad barque called the @entity116			1
the pocket watch was probably a gift to @entity49 when he was promoted to mate in 1866 , from his fellow sailors or his parents			1
@entity49 became captain of the ship and died in 1881 while the @entity116 was en route to @entity124 , which is modern - day @entity124 , in @entity126			1
he was buried at sea			0
the watch was lost on the @entity116 's return trip to @entity7 with a cargo of rice later that year			1
@entity107 believes the man who took over from @entity133 , captain @entity134 , was probably bringing the watch home in order to present it to @entity49 's widow			1
@entity134 probably intended to sail through @entity138 , between @entity139 and @entity7 , on his way to @entity141 , @entity13 said			2
but on a dark november night , in driving rain and gale - force winds , @entity134 took a wrong turn and found himself stuck in the @entity145 , along @entity7 ' south coast			1
" these ships could n't turn around -- they could only go 90 degrees to the winds , " @entity13 said			0
" he would n't have known where he was			0
" @entity13 said the captain would probably have been filled with fear to see the cliffs of the @entity12 coastline in front of him , where waves that night were probably at heights of 30 to 40 feet			0
with no way to turn around , the @entity116 crashed into the cliffs and sank			2
everyone on board the ship was saved , with the exception of captain @entity134 , who went down along with @entity49 's pocket watch			1
while that solved the mystery of the unidentified shipwreck , tracing @entity49 's descendants proved a tougher task			1
though @entity49 had a son , he died with no heirs , and @entity107 found no descendants from @entity49 's three sisters			1
@entity49 's only surviving relative is @entity174 , a retired dentist living in @entity175 , @entity51 -- incidentally , not far from @entity50			2
@entity174 's grandmother was @entity49 's cousin			2
@entity13 now plans to present the pocket watch next week to @entity174 , who in turn plans to present it to the @entity50 village hall for display in an annual exhibition			0
this year 's display will open a week from saturday , he said .			0
