" so proclaims the motto of @entity4 's athletics program			1
for years that seemed to be the case			0
under the tutelage of coach @entity9 , the football program has never been sanctioned by the @entity10 for a major violation and boasts one of the highest graduation percentages for athletes in @entity16 football			2
but just as a major program is only as good as its last win , so is one 's honor , one 's ethical status			2
the recent charges of sexual abuse of boys by a former @entity4 assistant football coach and the seeming years - long cover - up by university officials has befouled an illustrious program and the school 's honor			1
for those of us who have been influenced deeply by @entity9 's football career as proof that an ethical program can indeed be run in high - power college football , the visceral and immediate response is that of the child to @entity39 after the breaking of the " @entity43 " scandal in baseball , " say it ai n't so , @entity9			1
" but alas , it appears to be so			0
rather , however , than bemoan the decline in college sports , a topic upon which one could write for weeks , i am more concerned about what lessons we can learn from this experience and how it fits within a wide and , seemingly , growing culture committed to prostrating itself before the idol of monetary success			0
from banking scandals to @entity63 , elementary schools to universities , the scramble to succeed in dollar terms , to bring in ever more money has led individuals and organizations to ignore visible , powerful , and pressing evidence of malfeasance			2
money and power buy impunity , or at least rent it			2
the @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , and now @entity4 deserve the opprobrium that has been , and should be , heaped upon them for looking away , feigning ignorance , or covering - up the frauds , the abuses , the criminality			1
when we place our loyalty , our commitment , in the service of individuals , organizations , or money we already have started down the path of corruption			2
such misplaced loyalty , whether to a colleague in a hospital , a comrade in battle , or a stock trader on the floor , can only lead to error , wrongdoing , and evil			0
in appearing to place success above honor , the administration of @entity4 has aided a sexual predator and ruined numerous lives			1
in their loyalty to the university 's good name , they failed in their loyalty , nay their duty , to the victims and to society as a whole			0
for this they should be wholeheartedly condemned and punished			0
the firing of @entity9 and university president , @entity115 , are clearly the right steps in that direction			0
for the rest of us , we need also to look inward			0
as fans , investors , administrators and co-workers , how have we furthered this reality ? do we really desire the @entity10 to clamp down on abuses , even if it is our team ? as surgeons , do we report the incompetent or drunken medical colleague ? as individuals whose wealth increases , do we really care about the nature of the stock trades or the processes ? how we answer those questions determines the nature of our society			1
let us honor the coach who reports boosters slipping money to players , the co-worker who reports malfeasance , and the soldier who decries abuse and illegal orders			0
for if we do not , we ourselves must bear the guilt			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			1

@entity152 : @entity4 has betrayed its athletics motto , " @entity1 '
failing to report alleged crimes has befouled an illustrious program , he says
he says those who do n't report wrongdoing bear part of the guilt
queen : desire to *preserve* *institutions* or make more money corrupts many
