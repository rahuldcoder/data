-- a study released thursday claims that troops who report suffering post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of sexual trauma -- namely for rape , assault or harassment -- are much less likely to get benefits than troops claiming to suffer from ptsd because of other causes			1
the report from the @entity14 and the @entity15 looked into what is called military sexual assault trauma			2
specifically , how did troops ( male or female ) who claim to have experienced " sexual violence " fare in getting disability benefits ? not well for many of them , the advocates claim , calling the " often unsuccessful " effort to get such benefits " an unfair fight			0
" " they face a broken bureaucracy , with protracted delays and inaccurate adjudications , " the report 's authors write			0
" and ... it is clear that veterans who survive in - service sexual trauma also face discrimination in seeking compensation			2
" they point to data , obtained following lawsuits from the @entity42 , that show a persistent gap in the success rate of those troops seeking benefits for ptsd tied to sexual trauma compared to those who say they got ptsd for other reasons			1
the @entity42 responded in a statement , saying it is " committed to ensuring that veterans have access to military sexual trauma - related health care and disability benefits			1
" the @entity15 / swan report goes through the 2012 fiscal year and does not include @entity59 2013 , which ended september 30			2
data for the more recent fiscal year , the @entity42 points out , shows a 6 - percentage point gap in benefits grant rates for those with sexual trauma ptsd claims and all ptsd claims even without this data , those claiming ptsd due to sexual trauma have had increasing success in getting benefits			1
the claims of 56.8 % of them went through in fiscal year 2012 , much higher than the 30 % success rate in fiscal year 2008			0
the report 's authors point out approval rates for ptsd claims not related to sexual traumas went up as well : for @entity79 , those were at 73.3 % , up 20 % from a few years earlier			0
" the gap is really striking , " said @entity80 , executive director of @entity14			0
" ... the gap got even larger in 2011 and was large , as well , in 2012			0
" the @entity42 , however , highlighted training and other efforts that have led to the significant increase in the number of troops claiming sexual trauma who have received disability benefits			1
" the under secretary for benefits ( @entity93 ) has spearheaded @entity42 's efforts to ensure that these claims are adjudicated compassionately and fairly , with sensitivity to the unique circumstances presented by each individual claim , " the department said			2
" ... @entity93 's efforts have dramatically improved @entity42 's overall sensitivity			0
" notably , claims tied to military sexual trauma represent a fraction of the ptsd claims overall that @entity42 sees			1
over the 2008 through 2012 fiscal years , for instance , there were 15,862 such claims out of 591,456 overall			0
the report highlights significant differences among @entity42 regional offices in benefit grants for sexual trauma			1
co-author @entity115 , from the @entity113 at @entity114 , said that the variation between @entity42 offices for all @entity11 claims " is not nearly as widespread " as that for those specifically tabbed to sexual trauma			1
the office with the lowest approval rate for sexual trauma claims in @entity59 is in @entity124 , @entity125 , signing off on just 25.8 % of requests			2
offices in @entity128 and @entity129 had similarly low rates , while offices in @entity132 , @entity133 and elsewhere showed significant upticks in recent years .			0

@entity15 , swan release a report about troops seeking benefits for sexual trauma
they *'re* less likely to get benefits than troops seeking ptsd benefits for other reasons
@entity42 notes efforts to " compassionately " deal with sex trauma claims , notes major uptick
sexual trauma *victims* are increasingly likely to get benefits ; so are all ptsd sufferers
