-- revolutions devour their young			1
that lesson became well - known after the @entity4 , and it has proven itself true many times since then			0
now the @entity6 -- whose very name summed up the idealistic , democratic expectations of the activists that launched it and the optimistic reception their movement engendered around the world -- looks like it may well join the long list of popular uprisings that failed disastrously to meet those aspirations			1
it has turned out that mass movements would not swiftly sweep away entrenched dictators and replace them with pluralistic democratic rule			2
in @entity24 , where a street vendor set himself on fire in december 2010 , igniting the region , someone has been assassinating liberal politicians , raising tensions between the @entity32 - dominated government and an increasingly restless opposition			1
in @entity35 , what started as a peaceful uprising against the rule of president @entity38 has turned to civil war			1
more than 100,000 @entity35 are dead			1
millions more have fled , further destabilizing a fragile region			0
@entity42 , with the support of @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 , has stopped the opposition 's momentum			2
the democratic movement has been invaded by radical @entity50 , including @entity52 loyalists			2
the country is falling apart and could well end up as a failed state , run by warlords and split along sectarian lines			0
there are serious troubles also in @entity59 , and few if any signs of democratic progress anywhere else , not in @entity63 , @entity64 or @entity65			2
is the @entity6 over ? is there any hope for the people of the @entity70 @entity69 to enjoy true democracy , equality , respect for human rights , freedom of the press and of religion ? all eyes are now on @entity78 , the @entity70 world 's most important country , a state whose political example has proven a regional trendsetter over many decades			1
as in the other struggling @entity6 nations , democracy here has also found toxic soil			1
but the cause is not hopeless			0
despite the setbacks for revolution , something has changed in the region , and it is in @entity78 where the movement will live or die			1
it was in @entity95 's @entity94 where liberal groups launched their movement for democracy , only to see their vision hijacked by the @entity100			1
and it is in @entity78 where last month they made a push to save their revolution from @entity50 , only to be outplayed yet again , this time by the military and its leader , gen. @entity107			1
the highly disciplined @entity100 won the first wave of democratic elections , but its intentions differed sharply from those of the @entity94 protesters			2
president @entity113 , @entity78 's first freely elected president , set on a course to give his @entity100 steadily expanding control of the country			1
the @entity100 repeatedly broke promises and started to create a country dominated by its loyalists , firing critical newspaper editors , blocking opposing views from the writing of the new constitution , naming @entity100 members as provincial governors , allowing laws and practices that were disastrous , even deadly , for @entity128 , @entity129 and women			0
making matters much worse , the economy started spiraling down , creating enormous hardships for the @entity78 people			1
then the @entity137 ( rebellion ) movement gathered millions of signatures calling for the president 's resignation and new elections			2
on june 30 , millions of @entity78 took to the streets			2
within hours , the military put an end to the @entity100 rule			2
@entity113 has been held in an disclosed location since then , but the @entity148 's top diplomat , @entity147 , met with him for two hours monday			0
@entity78 by the millions are exhilarated by the end of the @entity100 experiment , intoxicated with gratitude to the military , grateful for removing the president			1
@entity107 's profile is rising			0
he 's clearly in command and exploiting the popular adulation			0
but is this what the @entity6 was supposed to do , replace an unelected dictator with a general and his hand - picked prime minister ? in a highly suspicious move , @entity107 called for a mass demonstration in support of the military on friday , summoning his backers to the streets , even as thousands of @entity113 supporters continued a sit - in outside a mosque			1
on the day of the protest , as if to provoke the @entity50 to confrontation , @entity113 was charged with murder and espionage			0
with the strong show of popular support , security forces took on the @entity50			0
in the clashes , which have been replicated in other cities , scores of @entity100 supporters have been killed			0
@entity182 @entity78 are getting worried			2
@entity107 's own words should be cause for concern			0
he has defended the military 's outrageous " virginity tests " on female activists as a way to " protect the girls from rape			1
" the military has promised a return to democracy next year , but @entity107 has written about the need to introduce another version of @entity32 rule to @entity78			1
authorities are reviving @entity200 - era institutions of repression amid an atmosphere of swelling nationalism and adulation for the military			0
this is a steep , seemingly impossible , challenge for liberals			0
the military saved them , but it could easily bury them			0
what they have in their favor is that the @entity6 introduced the concept of democratic legitimacy into @entity78			1
a government that strays too visibly , for too long , will ultimately face the wrath of the people			0
what activists should do , and the world should help them do , is stress the fundamental values of liberal democracy and publicly demand that the military affirm its own acceptance of those values -- which the @entity100 was criticized for violating -- including freedom of thought , freedom of the press and equal rights under the law for all			1
the killing of @entity100 supporters is a shameful violation of those principles			0
@entity78 needs to develop democratic institutions , political tolerance , real political parties and politically educated citizens			1
it 's a tall order			0
but it 's the only way to keep the revolution from devouring the ideals on which it was launched			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245 .			0

it 's long been known that revolutions devour their young , @entity247 says
the hope of the @entity6 has dimmed with @entity78 , @entity24 , @entity35 *upheaval* , she says
@entity247 : liberals in @entity78 benefited from the military 's move but may suffer as well
she says they must stand up for liberal , democratic values
