in many ways , shooting a engaging short video for @entity1 or @entity3 's @entity2 is harder than making a longer video			1
smartphone users have become pros at arty shots of food and sunsets , but brief video clips require a different skill set			2
it 's not easy to tell a compelling and coherent story in 6 seconds ( @entity2 's limit ) or even in 15 ( @entity1 's )			1
as @entity1 adds the ability to embed its photos and videos in outside blogs and websites -- a feature long requested by users -- we asked some experts for advice on how to make interesting , super-short videos			1

and do you have a creative video to show off ? tag it # cnnireport on your post			2
be picky about your subject a video takes up more of your followers ' time than an image			1
be discerning about what subjects are video worthy			0
not everything that makes a great @entity1 will translate well to video			1
for example , food shots are an @entity1 staple , but it 's harder to make a salad or bowl of pho look appetizing in motion			1
@entity57 video producer @entity55 suggests beginners start with the tried and true : " there is no way you can mess up a mini-video with adorable subjects			1
" grab the nearest dog , cat , baby , bunny , deer or grandma and record them being cute			0
if you 're going for atmospheric shots -- leaves in the wind , waves on a beach -- do n't linger too long on one shot without adding to the narrative			0
@entity81 and @entity82 , filmmakers at the production company @entity79 and @entity80 , recommend keeping it short or moving the story along with with a variety of shots			1
plan ahead part of the challenge of shooting video on @entity2 and @entity1 are the strict time limits			1
another is the requirement that you shoot the videos from within the apps			2
there is no importing video you 've already shot on either tool ( though technically you could record a screen playing an existing video , but some would classify that as cheating )			0
to make the most of these compact timeframes , plan ahead			0
if you 're crafting a story with multiple shots , figure out what they 're going to be ahead of time			0
on @entity1 , you can delete your most recent clips , while on @entity2 , you have to start over			1
neither tool lets you change the order of clips , so make sure you shoot in sequence			0
combine shots to tell a story it is possible to tell a story in 6 to 15 seconds			0
commercials have been cramming entire narratives into 15 seconds for years			0
weave in quick edits and a variety of shots by making each clip just 2 seconds long			0
the guys at @entity79 and @entity80 recommend starting with an establishing shot			0
if you 're doing a surfing video , you can open with a wide shot of the ocean and beach , then move to a close up of a surfboard or a sign with the name of the beach -- something that has a little more information and can move the story forward			0
add some tighter shots of someone waiting for a wave , catching it , and end with a wide shot of them back on the beach			0
ready , steady , go shooting with smartphones means your video may be shakier than usual			2
both @entity1 and @entity2 are plagued by a rash of jerky , dizzying videos filled with fast pans and constant movements			1
set the phone down on a steady surface or , even better , mount it on a tripod			2
if you 're holding the phone , @entity55 recommends locking your arms by extending them straight in front of you to minimize movement			0
if you must move while shooting , walk heel to toe , rolling the foot from back to front , in order to have a smoother shot			0
@entity81 says one other option is to move with the subject , so that even if the background or foreground are in motion , the subject stays in one place in the frame			1
some of the best things to come out of the short - video boom are the incredibly creative animations and stop - motion videos that people have cooked up			1
@entity2 automatically loops its 6 - second videos , meaning your little creation will play over and over			1
this has opened up the format to a variety of innovative and weird content			2
to make a stop - motion video , place the camera on a tripod or otherwise secure it so that it does n't move when you hit start and stop repeatedly			1
set up your scene -- say , a ball of @entity198 -- on a solid surface			0
hit start and stop as quickly as you can , then make small , incremental changes to the scene and repeat until you 've hit your time limit			1
a time - lapse video requires more time and patience , as well as better battery life			2
set up the camera in one spot and space out the quick clips , say one every 10 minutes for a sunset or every 30 seconds for a melting scoop of ice cream			2
pay attention to audio there 's no way to add a separate audio track in @entity2 or @entity1			1
when combining multiple shots , the ambient noise can add to the ambience of the video ( ocean waves , birds , cars ) or it can just come off as choppy , loud and distracting			0
@entity82 recommends covering the smartphone 's microphone for some quiet : " if you 're out and about and you do n't want it to sound disjointed , hold your finger over it or put a piece of paper over the mic , " he says			0
get good lighting stay in an area with stable light , says @entity55			0
do n't move quickly from a dimly lit room to the bright outdoors -- the phone wo n't have time to autocorrect for the lighting			0
avoid back - lighting your subjects , unless you 're going for the silhouette look			2
play with the medium people are still finding new ways to use these new video tools			0
personal videos of breaking news and stop motion videos have been early breakout stars of social media , but there will be a flood of groundbreaking content on @entity2 and @entity1 in the coming year			1
for example , some people have started making micro-how - to @entity1 videos , packing into 15 seconds what might have been stretched out to 3 minutes on @entity262			1
now that both types of videos are embeddable , the potential for innovative storytelling is even greater .			2
