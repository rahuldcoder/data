-- how do you replace the adrenaline - filled emotion of scoring one of the greatest goals in @entity6 history when your football career ends ? if you 're @entity8 , you start a multimillion - dollar horse racing business			1
it 's 16 years since a teenage @entity8 slalomed his way through the @entity13 defense to announce himself as @entity15 's brightest superstar at @entity16 ' 98			1
now he is cantering to success with his own horse stables -- not that it comes close to emulating the feeling of a sweetly struck goal			1
" the surge of emotion and adrenaline of scoring a goal can never be matched , no matter what you do , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity23 show			1
" this is a weird type of feeling			0
it 's a feeling of emptiness when you say cheerio to the horse and jockey down at the start and you 've just got no control over anything			1
" as a striker , even if you are part of an 11 - man team , your fate is very much in your own hands -- or rather feet -- and you 're judged by the number of goals you score			0
but as a racehorse owner , @entity8 's success or failure is governed by a whole new range of emotions			1
" with football you always feel in control			2
on the pitch , you can always do something to make something happen			0
your destiny is in your hands in many ways , " he says			0
" but with racing there 's none of that			1
it 's just a real emptiness			2
" except when your horse passes the winning post			2
" you 're just sitting there hoping ... but when one of your horses crosses the line in front it 's a great feeling and a great adrenaline rush			2
not quite that of scoring a goal , but it comes close			0
" @entity8 retired from football in march 2013 following an illustrious career in which he played for several of @entity78 's top clubs and scored 40 goals in 89 international appearances for @entity15			1
after starting his career at @entity82 , where he scored 158 goals in 297 games , @entity8 went on to play for @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			2
named @entity91 in 2001 , his pace and predatory instincts made him one of the most prolific strikers in the game before a succession of injuries took their toll			0
but horse racing always provided a much - needed escape from the pressure of playing at the highest level of the game , having been introduced to the " sport of kings " by his father @entity104			1
@entity8 set up @entity105 in may 2007 with trainer @entity106 and businessman @entity107			2
situated between @entity82 and @entity109 in northwest @entity110 , the 170 - acre operation houses 90 horses co-owned by up to 250 investors			1
while the pace may have gone from his own legs , @entity8 's horses continue to prosper , with 81 winners last season and over 60 this time around			1
as an elite footballer he was very well paid , but he is very conscious that his stables are well run financially even if it is a hobby			0
" it 's a business that takes a lot of money to run , " he says			0
" you do n't want to continue to not be in profit or at least break even , so the business is in a healthy position now			0
" i do n't want to have to plow money into it every year , which is why it 's important that it 's run correctly			0
" aside from that , it 's purely a hobby and if it gives me a lot of enjoyment then that 's exactly what it was built to be			0
" @entity8 remains connected to football , working as a media pundit for broadcasters such as @entity142 -- which is threatening to break @entity144 ' dominance of @entity146 coverage after landing big - money deals for the @entity148 and @entity149			1
his love for the game can be seen in an advert he did for @entity142 in a sketch where he sneaks into a recording booth to excitedly commentate on his greatest goals			0
" my real business and my real passion and my real purpose for getting up is still in football , " @entity8 says			1
" i look after a lot of young talented players in this country and i do a lot of television work and everything else connected with the game , so that 's where my main passion lies			0
" @entity8 is not alone when it comes to a love of football and horses -- trainer @entity172 played for @entity173 and @entity174 as well as @entity15			1
then there is @entity8 's former manager at @entity87 , @entity177 , who has an interest in a number of horses , which means he is often seen on racecourses around the country			1
@entity184 , who recently signed a $ 500,000 a week deal with @entity87 , also has his own horse -- @entity187			1
" @entity184 and his wife @entity188 own two horses with us , " @entity8 says			1
" his family love it as well -- his father and his granddad , they 're often down here , so there are a few footballers here			0
" the likes of @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 all part - own horses too , according to their former @entity87 teammate			0
" a lot of footballers enjoy it , " he adds			0
" the likes of @entity202 , @entity209 , he 's a big racing fan , and @entity211 likes his racing			2
" a lot of the others have just bought it for a day out or whatever , but some of them are really keen			0
" @entity8 's own horse , @entity219 , has enjoyed success in @entity15 and finished eighth at @entity223 's @entity222 in november 2013			1
he shot to fame in 2011 by winning the @entity225 at @entity226 -- a result which left @entity8 with tears of joy streaming down his face			2
while he does not profess to be a trainer , and is happy to leave such work to his 40 - strong stables staff , @entity8 does believe his experience of playing elite sport can be translated into the horse world			1
" the training of a racehorse is very similar to that of an athlete , " he says			0
" we 're all mammals at the end of the day , we require the same things to make us go fast and recover			0
" we all get stiff after work so there are a lot of things that football could teach racing and vice-versa			2
" as his playing fortunes dwindled , @entity8 's popularity dipped markedly at the end of his career and he was regularly targeted on social media with unrelenting abuse			1
with injuries curtailing his time on the pitch , he would more often be seen on the turf next to his horses than at football stadiums			1
it led to the accusation that he was no longer interested in football and simply picking up the wages to fund his new venture -- something he strenuously denies			0
" you live in a world as a footballer where people are quick to criticize or quick to question you , " @entity8 says			2
" but those same people that said , ' oh you 're taking your eye off the ball , setting up a business , ' they do n't realize that when you finish football you 're finished and you 've got nothing			0
" plenty of footballers have suffered from depression or squandered their considerable earnings , but @entity8 was determined not to fall into that category			2
" i 've got a young family , so i 've prepared for life after football , " he says .			0

@entity8 has moved from professional football to horse racing
@entity8 's stables houses around 90 horses
@entity184 has two horses which are looked after by @entity8
@entity8 says he has no intention of moving into training any time soon
