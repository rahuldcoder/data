-- nearly one out of every five @entity2 soldiers killed in @entity3 this year were killed by @entity3 police or army forces			1
nine of the 16 victims were @entity9 soldiers			0
this pattern of attacks raises a fundamental problem for the plans of the @entity9 and other @entity2 countries to draw down their forces over the next two years			1
that plan is , in part , predicated on the idea that as @entity3 forces take the lead in security operations , they will be supported by small numbers of @entity9 / @entity2 advisers embedded in @entity3 army and police units			1
those advisers will be quite vulnerable to attack			0
this problem was underlined earlier this week when an @entity31 ( @entity30 ) officer on monday shot and killed a @entity9 soldier in the eastern province of @entity34 , and the same day an @entity3 soldier murdered two @entity37 soldiers at a @entity2 base in @entity39 , the capital city of @entity40			1
monday 's shootings were the latest in a wave of attacks on international troops by @entity3 security forces , prompting concerns over the stepped up frequency of what @entity2 terms " green - on - blue " incidents			1
incidents of green - on - blue violence were rare in the first few years of the @entity53 , averaging no more than one a year through 2008			0
with the " surge " of 33,000 @entity9 troops in 2009 , though , the number of attacks jumped to 4 , likely due to the increased exposure of @entity3 forces to international troops			1
instead of tapering off , this upward trend continued to a peak of 12 incidents in 2011			0
and there have already been nine such attacks this year			0
in january , an @entity3 soldier fired on a group of @entity68 troops during a training exercise , killing four and wounding 16			0
the deadly attack prompted @entity68 president @entity71 to temporarily suspend @entity68 training programs in @entity3 and threaten the early withdrawal of @entity68 troops			0
@entity2 officials usually characterize these incidents as " isolated , " and not indicative of the overall relationship between coalition forces and their @entity3 partners			1
but the trust that might have once existed between international forces and their @entity3 counterparts has been seriously undermined by three recent incidents			2
-- in january a video surfaced on @entity84 showing @entity9 @entity85 urinating on the bodies of suspected @entity88 insurgents			0
-- this month @entity9 staff sgt. @entity89 was accused of going on a murderous rampage a mile from his base in @entity92 , killing 16 @entity3 civilians			2
-- the accidental burning of @entity95 by @entity9 soldiers at @entity97 on february 21 sparked massive protests across @entity3			2
during one such protest outside a military base in @entity101 , a man wearing an @entity3 army uniform turned his gun on @entity2 troops , killing two @entity9 servicemen			1
two days later , @entity3 wearing police uniforms shot and killed two @entity9 officers in one of the most secure areas of the @entity111			2
the @entity88 quickly claimed responsibility for the murders inside the @entity111 , saying they were in retaliation for the @entity116 burnings			0
however , the insurgent group 's involvement in planning most of the green - on - blue attacks is doubtful			0
a few perpetrators have found safe - haven with the @entity88 following their attacks , such as the @entity3 army soldier , @entity123 , who appeared in a @entity88 video in february boasting about his attack on @entity127 troops , but rarely have the @entity88 declared that the @entity3 soldiers and police who have turned their guns on @entity9 and @entity2 troops were working for them			1
with @entity9 forces making up almost 70 % of the @entity2 troops on the ground in @entity3 , it is not surprising that almost half of the attacks involved the death or injury of @entity9 troops , but as the bar chart on the left shows , many other @entity2 countries have also been the target of insider attacks by @entity3 security forces			1
sixteen @entity37 soldiers , for instance , have been killed in such attacks			0
@entity2 's withdrawal strategy requires a high degree of trust between small numbers of military advisors embedded with much larger units of @entity3 troops in order to succeed			1
this trust has now been eroded to a dangerous degree			0
does @entity2 have a @entity159 ?			2

@entity161 : @entity2 troops *falling* victim to shooting by @entity3 forces
he says the trust that once existed between @entity2 , @entity3 has been eroded
plans for drawing down @entity9 , @entity2 troops assume *handover* of duties to @entity3
@entity174 : does @entity2 have a @entity159 ?
