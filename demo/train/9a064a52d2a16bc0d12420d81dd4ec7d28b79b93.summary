-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 is famous for his flat - top and middle of the road politics			0
@entity5 , @entity1 's fellow @entity6 and would - be colleague from @entity8 , is known for her nose ring and her unabashedly liberal affiliations			1
although many insiders dismiss her campaign as a long shot , @entity5 is raising money at a prodigious rate and battling assertions that she is too radical for conservative - leaning @entity8			1
but on many issues , the candidate admits she needs to study up			1
but time is running out with @entity20 a little more than two months away			1
@entity21 , a @entity22 math teacher serving her first - term in the @entity8 state house , has already raised $ 180,000 in 10 days , according to her campaign , and sees " people coming out of the woodwork " to support her			1
according to @entity21 , who spoke with @entity0 last week , her nomination as the @entity34 @entity33 candidate " came from incredible circumstance			1
" @entity21 added that she had not even planned to seek re-election to her seat in the state legislature , let alone run for the @entity33			1
an untested candidate but that " incredible circumstance " comes with a price for @entity21 and the @entity41 who thrust an untested candidate into the national spotlight overnight			1
when asked her position on the situation in @entity47 , @entity21 told @entity0 , " give me a little more time			1
" on the border crisis , " i 'll need more time , you know only 11 days ago i was painting my storm windows			0
" one area the teacher had a firm answer was @entity54 , the controversial national education standards opposed by teachers ' unions but supported by the @entity59 administration			0
@entity21 said , " i am excited by @entity54 , as a teacher ... but there has been a rush to implement it and that 's the problem			1
" @entity65 professor @entity64 concedes that " she 's clearly rough			0
... it 's going to take time to get her answers down to sound bite quality			0
" not going to back down but @entity72 , a @entity34 @entity8 state senator , finds the lack of polish " a refreshing change from the usual spin			0
... her approach tells voters she is not going to back down			0
" her priorities : access to public lands , opposition to rep. @entity85 's @entity84 @entity83 budget , and " economic policies for the 100 % , not the 1 %			0
" @entity21 , 34 , has already garnered the support of the state 's unions , former @entity91 gov. @entity90 's @entity88 and @entity1 , the state 's two - term @entity34 senator			1
" as @entity8 's senior senator , i 'll be supporting @entity5 as well as all democrats who are talking about the issues that are important to @entity8 , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" @entity5 's energy and enthusiasm will be a refreshing change and will bring attention to issues facing working families like education and access to our public lands			1
" @entity1 helping out @entity1 's spokeswoman @entity107 confirmed that he has been helping @entity21 fundraise and plans to continue to make calls on her behalf			1
when @entity1 's counterpart , @entity111 , left the @entity33 this year for the @entity2 ambassador 's post in @entity114 , @entity8 @entity41 were in a pickle			0
they chose @entity118 , a decorated veteran , the head of the state 's @entity119 and its lieutenant governor , to keep the seat blue			1
it was already an uphill battle in the @entity125 state against popular freshman @entity2 rep. @entity126 , the @entity83 nominee			0
then the plagiarism charges hit after a @entity129 story detailed how @entity130 lifted large parts of his master 's thesis from others ' work			1
@entity130 dropped his campaign within two weeks , vowing to stay in the @entity33			0
little time to vet candidate rushing to fill the seat , they chose @entity21 at a nominating convention with little time to vet her for the job			2
after the nomination was announced , the state @entity83 circulated a montage of @entity21 's @entity150 videos that catalogue her first term as a state representative			1
in the video , @entity21 is critical of gun - rights supporters , calls herself " an anarchist at heart , " and explains she had to restrain herself from punching a fellow state representative who expressed anti-gay sentiments			2
chairwoman of the @entity164 @entity163 said the @entity83 is taking the remarks out of context in an attempt to smear @entity21			2
" i encourage you to watch the whole thing			0
they are not showing the full story , " @entity170 told @entity0			0
@entity21 , for her part , stands by the videos she contends are being manipulated , and encouraged voters to watch them in their entirety			2
" those videos are my public record , " @entity21 said			2
conservative criticism conservative critics have unearthed other controversial statements and affiliations , including @entity21 ' association with the @entity185			2
@entity185 is a far left union movement that hopes to " take possession of the means of production , abolish the wage system , and live in harmony with the @entity191 , " according to its website			0
her husband , @entity194 , is listed as a local organizer for @entity185 in @entity8			0
@entity197 of the conservative advocacy group @entity198 , which first published @entity21 ' affiliation with @entity185 , told @entity0 , " @entity200 disqualified a @entity33 candidate , but extremist ideology , advocacy of violence , and membership in the @entity185 results in nothing but praise for his replacement			2
this is what the @entity34 has become in 2014			0
" @entity21 campaign manager @entity212 was asked about the union affiliation and criticism , but replied by emphasizing her populist approach			2
" @entity5 grew up in a family that struggled to put food on the table so she knows first hand the struggles of @entity8 working families			2
unlike @entity224 , @entity5 believes that we must put working @entity8 families ahead of corporate special interests , " @entity212 said			2
dems see her as a net - plus @entity34 strategists see @entity21 's firebrand politics as a net - plus , if not for her race , for down ballot races			1
they confided that before her entry into the race , liberal voters were unlikely to turn out for the @entity34 ticket in an off - year			1
the @entity21 run will change that , they told @entity0			2
the @entity41 ' campaign arm , the @entity241 , is widely expected to lay low and not invest in the @entity21 campaign , which is down double digits in the latest polling			0
professor @entity64 thinks it increasingly unlikely @entity21 will receive significant outside support " unless she closes in on @entity249 in the polls and money race			1
" for their part , the @entity252 is confident that @entity21 wo n't be able to breakthrough against @entity126 , who has a huge advantage in name recognition and fundraising			0
" our strategy will remain internal , but it seems telling that the @entity241 is telling allies that they 've given up on the race entirely , " said @entity252 spokeswoman @entity257			0
but @entity21 backers remain upbeat			0
@entity72 said the @entity83 " should take ( @entity5 ) seriously " since she raised $ 150,000 in the first week of her campaign " just using social media ! " calls by @entity0 to the @entity241 seeking comment were not immediately returned .			0

a late entry into @entity270 race , @entity5 is unabashedly liberal
many insiders dismiss her candidacy as she trails in polls , but she 's raising money
on many issues , @entity21 admits that she needs to study up , but @entity20 is not that far off
@entity21 *stepped* in after @entity118 's candidacy *imploded* over plagiarism *allegations*
