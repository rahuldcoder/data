-- @entity1 is not one to rest on her laurels			1
after giving birth for the first time in january -- providing @entity7 's fourth great - grandchild -- the equestrian star could be forgiven for taking a break from the harsh demands of the stables			1
yet just three months on , the @entity11 @entity13 's eldest granddaughter would find herself back on that familiar saddle competing once more			1
by august , she had remarkably gone a long way to likely booking her place in what will be her second @entity18			1
" it was harder than i thought it was going to be			0
i had a lot of friends who said , ' do n't come back too quickly			0
' i sat on a horse about five weeks after ( giving birth ) , " @entity24 tells the @entity26 show			1
but come back quickly she did			0
eight and a half months after @entity30 -- the 16th in line for the throne in @entity11 -- was born on january 17 , her mother placed 11th in the eventing at the @entity34 in @entity35 , helping her nation to silver and @entity18 qualification			1
@entity40 ' performance in @entity41 , which among the @entity11 riders was only bettered by world no. 1 @entity43 , could well be enough to persuade @entity11 's @entity18 selectors that she is worthy of a spot in @entity47 in 2016			1
the master plan had come to fruition			0
" i always wanted to get back for the @entity49 at the right time , " @entity24 says			1
" i 've given myself enough time to get back where i left off			0
" the objective now , as well as bringing up her daughter with rugby star husband @entity55 , is winning @entity18 gold			1
she claimed team eventing silver at @entity59 , where she was presented her medal by her mother @entity61 -- who competed for @entity11 in equestrian at the @entity64 ' 76 games			1
her father , @entity24 , won eventing gold at @entity69 ' 72 and silver in @entity68 16 years later			1
@entity24 ' parents divorced in 1992			1
yet despite now being a fully - fledged @entity71 , the 33 - year - old @entity1 still feels she has some unfinished business to attend to when she , if all goes to plan , touches down in @entity47 in two years ' time			1
" when you come out of the @entity18 you just go , ' let 's just do it all again , ' " @entity24 says			1
" to be able to come out with a medal ( in @entity78 ) was incredible			2
but we wanted gold and we probably should have got it			2
" we 'd definitely like to go back and try and change the color			0
" in 2012 , @entity24 had a whole host of royalty fighting her corner , with princes @entity43 and @entity86 , to name just a few , among those cheering on their relative from the stands			1
come 2016 , @entity30 -- who will be superseded as the youngest member of @entity11 's royal family when @entity43 's wife @entity93 gives birth for the second time -- could be watching her mother 's bid to win gold , having already spent time on the equestrian circuit			1
" she 's been on the road			0
there 's so many kids on the circuit , so many people who 've had babies already , " @entity24 says			1
" we 're lucky because we can ride and go back and forth a bit , it fits in really well			0
it seems to have worked and hopefully it will keep going like that			0
" having admitted to not feeling maternal before @entity30 's birth , @entity24 has since treasured the experience of becoming a mother for the first time			1
" i 've really enjoyed it			0
in a funny kind of way it 's like having another type of high - performance horse on your hands , " she jokes			2
" it 's an incredible bond you have			0
i 'm lucky , she 's really good			0
" @entity24 has had plenty of experience developing special bonds down the years , having nurtured a number of relationships with her horses since being introduced to riding as a child by her equine - loving family			1
it was with her beloved @entity139 that she first started competing properly , soon going on to become both a @entity142 and world champion -- taking continental glory in 2005 and 2007 , while conquering the globe at the first attempt in 2006			0
@entity18 success came alongside @entity147 , and he could well be @entity148 ' partner in @entity47 , given that she rode the bay gelding in @entity35			1
" i 've had him since he was a five - year - old , " @entity24 says of @entity147 , now 13			1
" we 've come up the levels together and taught each other everything			0
" i 'm trying to teach him			0
i think it really helps that i 've had him for that long and know him very well			2
" @entity24 ' equestrian career , though , has not come without its setbacks			2
injury to the now - retired @entity139 cost her likely selection for the @entity164 in @entity165 , while lightning unfortunately struck twice four years later as another injury to the chestnut gelding ruled her out of @entity170			2
@entity24 also broke her collarbone in 2008 after falling off @entity172 , and the horse had to be put down			2
" i think you get to see the signs when things are really good and when things are n't so good , " @entity24 reflects			2
" you would hope that you would notice before anything went too wrong			0
and that 's what you always try			0
" she remains ever - indebted to the role her family have played in helping to lay the foundations for her successful career			0
her grandmother , one of the great patrons of @entity11 horse racing , still rides at the age of 88			2
" i remember always being around the yard and being around horses			0
it was great fun , you know , " @entity24 says			2
" you get this passed down through the family and that 's where it sort of came from			0
obviously we 're very grateful to our family and hobbies and traditions , and the love and passion they 've got for the horses has filtered down through the years			0
" " horses mean everything to me , " @entity24 adds			2
" they 're what i do -- my work and my passion			0

@entity1 helps @entity11 qualify for 2016 @entity18 less than nine months after giving birth
@entity24 now targeting gold medal in @entity47 after claiming silver at @entity59
the 33 - year - old is treasuring the experience of being a mother to @entity30
