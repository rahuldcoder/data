-- are you truly happy ? if you were presented with a group of people you 've never met , could you determine who was really satisfied with their life ? a panel of five people took a test to see how happy they really are			1

@entity14 , @entity17 and @entity16 scored the highest on the satisfaction scale , while @entity15 and @entity18 scored the lowest			1
satisfaction for @entity14 is achieved by surrounding herself with happiness			1
the most important thing ? her husband			0
" he is there for me			0
he does n't only love me , he appreciates me and makes me feel good , " @entity14 says			1
happiness does n't depend on money , she says			1
it 's about enjoying the simple things			0
" every morning i have a ritual			0
after the boys have left , [ my husband and i ] get in the hot tub , and it 's our time			0
we talk about what is going on for the rest of the day			0
it is just our quality time just to stay connected			0
" @entity17 , the funeral director , says he 's developed phrases that help him keep a positive outlook			1
" i will say , ' it 's a marvelous monday			0
it 's a terrific tuesday , ' " he says			0
although he deals with death daily , @entity17 says his job is anything but depressing			1
" most people look upon funeral service as a sad profession			1
i look upon it as a profession where i 'm helping people at a very difficult time in their lives , " he says			1
" being successful in life is not what really matters			0
being significant in life is really the core root of what matters			0
" @entity16 says she lives by the philosophy , " negative out , positive in			1
" she says she believes happiness is a conscious effort			1
" it 's about claiming what 's yours			0
if you want a positive life , you need to think positively and act positively , " she says			0
" i do my best not to compare myself with others			0
i 've always felt that what one person has may not be destined for me			1
" dr. @entity99 has dedicated his life to studying the pursuit of happiness			1
the psychologist is the founder of the @entity104 in @entity105 and the author of 10 best - selling books , including " happiness now ! " dr. @entity99 says those looking for happiness often do n't realize they already have it			1
it 's a lesson that he says he was lucky to learn at age 18 from a spiritual teacher			0
" he said , ' look , actually , @entity99 , you 're already happy			1
' and i said , ' well , that 's great , but i do n't feel it			1
so tell me , what do i have to do ? ' " dr. @entity99 recalls			0
" and he said , ' you have to understand that the pursuit of happiness is a mistake			1
it 's like , you do n't chase happiness out there			1
you learn that you 're happy inside you , and then you go running			1
then you go into the world			0
' " when looking at the guests who scored the highest on the happiness scale , dr. @entity99 says he instantly recognizes the keys to their satisfaction			1
for @entity17 , it 's his job			1
" your job just helps you to have a great perspective on life , which is , ' we 're just here for a short spell , and it 's really important to make the most of it , ' " dr. @entity99 says			1
@entity16 uses the law of attraction to stay happy , dr. @entity99 says			1
" @entity16 , basically what i see is that you 've chosen to be an optimist			1
you have had some difficult times in your life , and you 've had bad circumstances , but you 've made great choices			2
and this is how the law of attraction works , " he says			0
" what i found is that basically we have beliefs about life , and our perception gathers evidence to prove that our beliefs are right			0
so an optimist believes that good things can come from bad situations			1
" after taking the happiness test , @entity15 found that she received the lowest score possible -- a 5 out of 35			2
so how can @entity15 find fulfillment ? dr. @entity99 says to look within her heart			0
" what really occurs to me is ... you are such a good person			1
... but i realized that you 've not made some of the best choices in your life in the past , " dr. @entity99 says			0
" those choices , i think , are being motivated really by a lack of what i call self - acceptance , which is where we somehow do n't believe we deserve any more than we have			2
" the law of attraction could make a big difference for @entity15 , dr. @entity99 says			0
" the way the law of attraction works is that as we increase our self - acceptance , we attract more happiness , " he says			2
dr. @entity99 says @entity15 needs to realize she is , indeed , a great person			1
one way she can do that is to surround herself with people who already know that			2
" i think it 's also great to have some friends around you who can remind you , because we do forget , " dr. @entity99 says			1
@entity15 says she feels like she 's taking her first step on the road to happiness			2
" i feel like i 'm starting			0
i can feel it , " she says			0
@entity18 scored in the middle range of the satisfaction test and says people often mistake her for being happy because she puts on a false front , whether she 's being a room mom for one of her six children or attending a @entity45 meeting			2
dr. @entity99 gets to the root of her dissatisfaction			0
" you 're so good at helping everybody else , i think you 're in danger of leaving yourself out of your own life , " dr. @entity99 says			1
" what we have here is a classic what i call a martyr ethic , which is where we 're putting everybody else first instead of ourselves			2
" in fact , dr. @entity99 says @entity18 can help herself and give an important gift to her family -- her own happiness			2
" i know you ... want your children to be happy , and i tell you this : you ca n't just tell them to be happy			2
you show them with your example			0
and that 's the big key , " dr. @entity99 says			0
@entity18 can start today by simply asking for help			0
" i think the big mistake here , and it 's a common one , is that we try to do our lives by ourselves , " dr. @entity99 says			0
" it 's time to stop being a super mom and start being a real mom			0
