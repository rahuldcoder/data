in just the past week , questions over the @entity2 targeting of the tea party and other groups have reached a new level of volume and , frankly , confusion			1
this , after the tax agency revealed that it lost an unknown number of emails in the investigation due to hard drive crashes from years ago			2
the most wanted of those missing emails belong to @entity15 , who ran the @entity2 division in charge of tax - exempt status and was the highest - ranking official to be directly connected to the political targeting			1
@entity15 has refused to testify about the controversy , invoking her constitutional right not to do so			1
friday , @entity2 commissioner @entity23 will face sharp questions about the missing emails and hard drive crashes in an appearance before the @entity28			1
here are some key things to know about the @entity2 controversy : what do we know about the missing @entity15 emails ? an unknown number of her emails , dating between 2009 and mid- 2011 , are missing			1
the @entity2 notified @entity37 last week that they were lost when her computer hard drive crashed in 2011			1
we do n't know exactly how many are missing because a ) they are missing and b ) the @entity2 has managed to retrieve 24,000 of the lost emails by searching through the accounts of dozens of other @entity2 employees who could have been included in those emails			1
overall , the @entity2 has turned over 750,000 pages of documents in the investigation , including 67,000 emails			1
this investigation 's been going on for a year			0
when did the @entity2 know about these missing emails ? it depends who you ask			1
when @entity54 spoke with the @entity2 commissioner on tuesday , @entity23 said that agency investigators knew about the crashed @entity15 hard drive in " late spring			1
" but the @entity28 insists that on that same day , the @entity2 told them it knew about the problem in february			1
it is not clear why the @entity2 waited to tell @entity37			2
how exactly can government emails be lost forever ? ah yes			2
during this time period ( 2009 - 2011 ) , the @entity2 capped how much material each employee could keep in an email account to about 1,800 emails			1
if the employee went above that capacity , the individual had to either delete emails or move them to their hard drive			0
all of them on @entity15 's hard drive were lost when it crashed			2
government to revise proposed regulations on controversial tax - exempt groups but , did n't the emails stay on a server or somewhere else in the system ? the @entity2 has said no. that during this time period , the only system - wide email storage were backup tapes erased every six months			1
thus the only permanent storage of emails was on employees hard drives			0
the agency changed this policy in may 2013			0
how do we know @entity15 's hard drive really did crash ? the @entity2 has supplied @entity54 and others with emails between @entity15 and the it department during the time of the crash			1
at the end of a chain of emails , on august 5 , 2011 , an employee wrote , " unfortunately the news is not good			0
the sectors on the hard drive were bad which made your data unrecoverable			0
" @entity15 replied , " i really do appreciate the effort			2
" what happened to the hard drive ? can the @entity2 double check for emails ? no. according to the @entity113 , the @entity2 told them that the hard drive has been " recycled " and is no longer accessible			2
it is not clear if the hard drive is still in the agency 's possession			0
what about the other missing emails ? did six other hard drives also crash ? the @entity28 says that this past monday , the @entity2 told them that the agency also lost emails belonging to six other @entity2 employees whose hard drives had also crashed			1
one of those six employees was particularly important : @entity128 , who had worked as chief of staff to the former head of the @entity2			2
@entity128 was known to be involved in discussions about the @entity133 targeting			0
the agency told @entity54 : " the @entity2 in recent days identified other instances where individuals had hard - drive issues			2
we are still assessing whether any of this data is permanently irretrievable , so it is premature to say that a significant amount of this data was lost as a result of these issues			0
" @entity144 - led @entity28 votes to hold former @entity2 official in contempt why did n't the @entity2 tell everyone about the other missing emails ? that 's not clear			1
the @entity2 seemed to only tell one @entity150 , not other congressional groups , working on the issue			2
this is a particularly harmful aspect of the controversy to the @entity2 because the same day that the @entity150 says it learned of the additional missing emails , the two top senators investigating the matter sat down with @entity23			1
and sen. @entity158 , a @entity159 @entity144 , says that neither @entity23 nor the staff with him mentioned the other missing emails			0
@entity158 sent a letter to @entity23 thursday expressing intense frustration			0
" clearly someone was aware of this information when we met and chose not to disclose it to me , " he wrote			0
@entity158 later took to the @entity113 floor and said he did n't feel he could trust information from the @entity2 any longer			0
@entity170 files suit against @entity2 on @entity172 back to all this email , is n't the @entity2 required to keep every communication ? did the @entity2 break the law ? this could be a significant question and point of debate at friday 's hearing			1
federal regulation generally requires agencies to retain items of official record			0
the @entity2 insists that its email policy met that regulation and that the determination of what was " official " ( vs what was personal ) was up to each employee			2
thus , the agency asked @entity15 and each @entity2 employee to move any " official " email to their hard drive to be saved			1
@entity144 have already indicated they are not satisfied with that answer			0
is n't it hypocritical that the agency requiring taxpayers to keep receipts for three years only kept emails for six months ? lawmakers are raising that precise point			0
in response , the @entity2 says it simply does not have the funds for enough server space to keep every e-mail permanently			0
@entity23 estimates that would cost up to $ 10 million			0
what is @entity37 doing about all this right now ? there are three committees looking into this			0
these efforts are led by @entity144 with the exception of what has been a bipartisan investigation underway in the @entity113			0
* @entity28 : is holding its hearing			2
chairman @entity220 , a @entity221 @entity144 , has also asked the @entity28 to turn over any emails between its offices and @entity15 and requested that the @entity225 launch an investigation and audit into the hard drive crash			1
* @entity229 : has issued a subpoena for @entity23 to appear at a hearing monday , june 30			0
the @entity2 has not officially responded yet			0
oversight chairman @entity232 , a @entity233 @entity144 , led the effort for the @entity28 to hold @entity15 in contempt of @entity37 for not testifying about the targeting controversy			1
the committee is now waiting for the @entity225 to determine how it will handle the contempt charge			0
* @entity113 has put its bipartisan report on the @entity2 controversy on hold			2
it was nearly completed last week when the @entity2 told lawmakers about the @entity15 hard drive crash			1
@entity158 , the top @entity144 on the panel , has called for an independent investigation into how the @entity2 has handled congressional requests and the search for information about @entity15			1
@entity232 's @entity250 counterpart : you 're pulling a @entity252 in @entity2 case			0
