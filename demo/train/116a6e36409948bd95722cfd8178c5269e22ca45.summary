@entity0 -- @entity2 has never had a problem getting into the muck of politics			1
since leaving the @entity7 in 2001 and stepping into the role of the @entity10 ' elder statesman , the former president has continually shown why he rose from humble roots in rural @entity12 to president of the @entity14 in the first place : his political chops and willingness to use them			0
so when @entity19 , the uber - @entity20 strategist , floated questions about @entity23 's health , it was no surprise that @entity2 was the one to respond from " @entity25 , " not @entity23			1
" i 've got to give him credit , " @entity2 said of @entity19 on wednesday at an event in @entity0			1
" that embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds			0
first they said she faked her concussion			0
and now they say she 's auditioning for a part on ' @entity38			0
' " @entity2 went on to say he was " sort of dumbfounded " by the fact that @entity19 reportedly hinted last week that @entity23 may have suffered a " traumatic brain injury " when she fell and suffered a concussion in december 2012			1
as a result of the fall , she suffered a blood clot in a vein between her skull and brain and was treated at a @entity50 hospital for three days			0
@entity2 said he had no questions about his wife 's health			1
" look , she works out every week , she is strong , she 's doing great			0
as far as i can tell she 's in better shape than i am			0
she certainly seems to have more stamina now , " he said			0
" i do n't know but if it is you ca n't be too upset about it			0
it is just the beginning			0
they 'll get better at it			0
i am still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to @entity69			0
" fear factor : @entity19 comments show @entity20 's concerns about @entity2 @entity2 's response was mild , but there were undertones that there was more where that came from			1
according to one of the former president 's advisers , he considered @entity19 's comments a weak attack			1
" so stupid as to be a low hanging curve ball , " the adviser told @entity1 's @entity84			0
@entity86 slams ' @entity20 consultant class ' notably , however , @entity23 -- who has tried to remain above politics while she weighs a possible @entity7 run -- remained mum about the kerfuffle			1
at two events in @entity0 on wednesday -- one to a prominent @entity94 group and another at the @entity95 -- the former first lady did n't come close to addressing the @entity19 questions and instead left the job of responder - in - chief to her husband			1
the role is a familiar one for @entity2			2
" i think he says whatever he wants whenever he wants to , " @entity102 , a former @entity103 adviser , told @entity1 's " @entity105 " on thursday			0
" i think it is natural			0
" since his wife agreed to become @entity14 's top diplomat in early 2009 and now that she is weighing a run at the presidency , @entity2 has rarely shied away from getting into the political fray			1
he endorsed candidates who helped with his wife 's 2008 presidential run and looked to bury those who crossed the @entity115 during that failed campaign			2
@entity2 's role is put into full perspective in " @entity119 : @entity120 of @entity23 , " a book by @entity122 and @entity123 that details @entity23 's time at the @entity125			1
according to the authors , @entity126 , a former congressman from @entity127 , was the epitome of @entity2 's political retribution			1
@entity2 defends @entity23 over @entity131 " if there was a poster boy for the betrayal - and - revenge narrative , it was @entity126 , a tall , broad - shouldered former @entity136 football player who had won his western @entity138 seat in the midterm @entity10 landslide of 2006 , " the authors wrote , before describing the lengths the @entity115 went to in the run up to the 2008 election to win over the congressman			1
when @entity126 decided not to endorse anyone , the congressman was blacklisted and earned @entity2 's ire			1
" the bill for @entity126 's neutrality would come due nearly four years later , to the day , in the 2012 @entity127 @entity10 primary , " write @entity123 and @entity122 , when the former president choose to endorse @entity148 over @entity126			2
when @entity148 went on to win the primary , his victory was largely attributed to two things : his strong labor support and the endorsement he picked up from @entity2			2
although @entity126 's anecdote is a colorful example , the story is not totally unique			0
on wednesday , for example , the former president endorsed @entity160 gubernatorial hopeful @entity159 over his top challenger , @entity160 attorney general @entity161			0
@entity2 touted @entity159 's record and notes that he felt " enormous affection " for him			1
not surprisingly , @entity159 was a vocal supporter of @entity23 's failed 2008 bid and traveled to a number of states on the campaign 's behalf			1
@entity161 , on the other hand , was a proud supporter of @entity170 and co-chaired his 2008 primary campaign in @entity160			0
@entity2 's support was so potent that when the @entity159 campaign announced it in april , @entity161 felt it necessary to issue a statement that spelled out his " respect " for the former president and his strong support for @entity23 , " should she choose to run " in 2016			1
whether @entity23 will run is not the only question facing the @entity115 right now , though			2
in order for her to be successful , a number of @entity10 strategists have said , @entity2 's role will also have to be defined			1
in 2008 , @entity2 was a staple of the campaign trail and while he was a prolific fundraiser and campaigner , he also had a few notable blowups as things went sour			2
republicans -- some of whom would probably like to see less of @entity2 -- suggest that he would be a political liability for a @entity2 campaign			2
" @entity23 can not hide behind her husband on this			2
it was an interesting decision , if it was one , to have him come out and say anything , " said @entity198 , a @entity20 strategist , about @entity2 's response to @entity19			1
" i think they need to really pull @entity2 back			2
he is not as good at this now as he used to be			0
" @entity10 scoff at that assertion and point out that other than @entity23 herself , the former chief executive is probably the one closest to her thinking on political issues and whether or not she will run			2
@entity102 responded to @entity210 with this : " i do n't think we will be taking your advice			0

it was no surprise that @entity2 responded to @entity19 's attack on his wife
@entity19 , the @entity20 strategist , questioned @entity23 's injuries in a 2012 fall
@entity2 's response suggested that there was more where that came from
