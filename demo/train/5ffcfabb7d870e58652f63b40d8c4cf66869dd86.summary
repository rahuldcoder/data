-- the chief prosecutor in the murder trial of @entity3 accused him on monday of " tailoring " his version of how he killed his girlfriend , as the grueling cross-examination of the track star went into a second week			1
prosecutor @entity8 has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of @entity12 , whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his luxury home in @entity16 , @entity17			1
his questions have sought to undermine @entity3 ' reliability and credibility and to portray the @entity22 and @entity23 athlete as someone who was inventing his version of events to suit his story			1
@entity28 , known in @entity17 legal circles for his bulldog - like approach to questioning , has gone through minute detail regarding the early hours of @entity33 2013 , repeatedly challenging the double amputee over his actions that night			1
on monday , in yet another intense scrutiny of his story , the prosecutor again tried to exhaustively highlight apparent inconsistencies between @entity3 ' bail application and his testimony in court to show he is " tailoring his evidence " to suit the defense case			1
" i am going to point out to you how improbable your version is , " @entity28 told the runner , who sat immobile , staring ahead at the judge as he answered questions			0
the prosecution 's argument is that @entity3 shot @entity12 intentionally after a heated argument			1
@entity3 does not deny shooting her but insists that he mistook her for an intruder			1
" i did not fire at @entity12 , " @entity3 told the court , his voice breaking , causing a second brief adjournment in the day 's proceedings so he could gather himself			1
scrutinizing every detail @entity28 took @entity3 detail by detail through what happened on the night of @entity12 's death -- where he moved , how he moved , what he saw -- aggressively questioning him about the moments before the shooting			1
speaking about the noise he said he thought had been caused by intruders , the athlete described how he started shouting			0
asked what he shouted , @entity3 broke down as he answered : " get the f * * k out of my house			1
get the f * * k out of my house			0
" ' i was screaming ' the prosecutor pressed on why the athlete did n't give fuller details of his account in his bail statement			0
@entity3 said then that there was a noise from the bathroom that caused him to think that people had broken into his house			1
he later explained that it was the bathroom window sliding across and slamming against the frame			0
the athlete said on monday that he was on medication and traumatized while in a jail cell at the time of his bail statement			0
@entity28 also said it was improbable that , according to @entity3 ' story , @entity12 did not ask him why he was getting out of bed in the middle of the night to retrieve fans from the edge of the balcony			1
he repeatedly asked the athlete why he fired , and if he did so intentionally			2
" no , i did not , " @entity3 said			1
" i fired because i got a fright			0
" @entity28 has openly called the athlete 's version " a lie , " contending @entity3 knew exactly what he was doing when he fired his gun			1
" i blame myself for taking @entity12 's life , " @entity3 said			1
describing what happened after the shots , @entity3 ' high - pitched voice wobbled			2
he said he went to the bed and realized @entity12 was not there , and then felt the curtains to see if she was behind them			2
" then i was panicking , realizing she was n't answering , " the runner said			0
" i was screaming , i was screaming out for her			0
" @entity28 said his next line of questioning would deal with the toilet			0
he asked to continue on tuesday morning and the trial was adjourned for the day			2
' emotional memories ' the prosecutor has repeatedly asked the runner why he was getting " emotional " as @entity28 's questioning has drawn tears			0
" is it about what happened , or the questions and your frustration with answering them ? " @entity28 said , asking @entity3 if he was using his emotions as an escape			2
@entity3 said he was not			2
" it 's emotional memories for me , " the runner replied			0
@entity3 , 27 , has denied he acted selfishly toward @entity12 , who was 29 when she died			1
in a bid to paint their relationship as rocky , @entity28 has ripped apart message exchanges between the couple			0
@entity28 also sought to paint @entity3 as selfish and demanded to know why the athlete did not respond to his girlfriend 's declaration of love			1
but @entity3 said he preferred to talk to his girlfriend over the phone rather than messaging			1
he acknowledged he never got a chance to tell her that he loved her			0
" because it was all about mr. @entity3 , " @entity28 said			2
the trial has gripped @entity17 , where @entity3 is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity			2
his disabled lower legs were amputated when he was a baby , but he went on to achieve global fame as the " @entity3 , " winning numerous @entity23 gold medals on the steel blades fitted to his prostheses			2
only those in the courtroom can see @entity3 because he has chosen not to testify on camera			2
his testimony can be heard on an audio feed			0
@entity12 's mother , @entity169 , has been in court throughout his testimony			1
