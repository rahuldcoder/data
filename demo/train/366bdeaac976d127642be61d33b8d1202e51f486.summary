-- once again , there are rumblings that the third - and fourth - largest @entity4 wireless carriers may merge to form a larger combined no. 3			0
but would this be enough to keep the @entity4 wireless market competitive for consumers ? last week @entity8 reported that @entity9 , the parent company of @entity10 , is negotiating a possible sale of @entity10 to @entity12 according to @entity14 and the @entity15 , some industry analysts believe the @entity4 government would approve this merger			1
rumors of this merger have been around since 2009 , when @entity20 was eyeing a purchase of @entity12			1
and last weekend , @entity22 reported on an ambiguous non-confirmation / non-denial memo sent to @entity10 employees by ceo @entity26			1
given the nature of wireless networks and the current business landscape , @entity10 probably needs to make some kind of major move if it hopes to survive in some form			2
in the big picture , it takes a lot of capital to build out high - speed wireless broadband networks that can support an ever - growing number of data - hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets -- especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular , and if the @entity44 administration is serious about its national wireless initiative to make wireless broadband available to 98 % of the @entity4 population			0
carriers with the largest customer base -- especially the most customers locked in to pricey two - year contracts -- are in the best financial position to build out their 4g networks			2
having those networks , in turn , makes the largest carriers even more likely to attract even more customers			0
and this is the economic dynamic that could turn the @entity4 wireless market into a @entity63 / @entity62 duopoly , with only some discount carriers surviving on the fringes			1
for @entity4 mobile users , further wireless market consolidation is a good news / bad news situation			0
it offers the promise of ubiquitous high - speed wireless broadband networks available in markets outside major metro areas , which would lessen the geographic aspect of the mobile digital divide			0
but just because wireless broadband is available in a region does n't mean everyone there can afford to use it			0
a less competitive wireless market could mean wireless broadband wo n't get much cheaper			0
and it could even get more costly , especially if tiered data plans become the norm -- which would make more sense for the carriers in a less competitive environment			0
that would be bad news on the income / class front of the mobile digital divide			0
lately , @entity10 has been taking a bit of a beating in the @entity4 market			2
@entity8 noted : " @entity10 ... has lost customers at an accelerated rate as it trailed rivals in building out a third - generation mobile network and missed out on being able to sell @entity102 's @entity101			1
about 56,000 customers abandoned @entity10 last year , while @entity12 , @entity62 and @entity63 all boosted their counts			1
" consequently , @entity20 may not be pleased with what @entity12 may be willing to offer for @entity10 -- so who knows if this merger will happen			1
furthermore , a @entity10 / @entity12 merger might be difficult for technical reasons			1
@entity110 noted : " @entity10 currently markets its @entity111 + network as @entity113 but lacks the bandwidth to deploy @entity115 or @entity116			2
@entity12 and @entity10 use different network technology and operate on different spectrum bands , which would complicate a possible merger of the companies ' wireless services			1
" if @entity10 hopes to survive intact , it 'll need access to much more bandwidth in more @entity4 locations			2
so if the @entity12 merger does n't happen , @entity10 does have options -- mainly leasing additional spectrum or access to other providers ' networks , such as @entity130 , a wholesale - only wireless lte network			1
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity133 .			0

@entity9 is negotiating a possible sale of @entity10 to @entity12
about 56,000 customers abandoned @entity10 last year
by contrast , @entity12 , @entity62 and @entity63 all boosted their *subscriber* bases
