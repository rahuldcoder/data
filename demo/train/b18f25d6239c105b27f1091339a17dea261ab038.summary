-- world champions @entity1 meet @entity2 tuesday at @entity3 in a rematch of the 2006 world cup final and the 2002 @entity7 final -- but with very different consequences			1
@entity10 players train monday in @entity11 ahead of their showdown with @entity2			0
with both sides still seeking their first win of the tournament , defeat for either in @entity11 would mean certain elimination from @entity18 and an ignominious return home for the losing squad			2
should @entity21 beat the @entity22 -- who are expected to rest key players having already qualified for the quarterfinals -- in the group 's other match in @entity29 both sides face elimination regardless of the result			1
@entity32 coach @entity31 and @entity10 counterpart @entity33 could also find their jobs on the line if their players fail to meet the expectations of two countries steeped in footballing success			1
going into the tournament , both the @entity1 and @entity2 -- who also met twice in qualifying -- had been considered among the favorites despite being placed in the toughest group			1
but shock defeats against the @entity47 -- 3 - 0 and 4 - 1 respectively -- and failure to beat the defensively minded @entity49 has left them scrambling for survival			0
" nobody would have thought that @entity1 - @entity2 would be a last - ditch match , " said @entity10 goalkeeper @entity51 , whose penalty save against @entity21 kept his country 's slim hopes of making the last eight alive			1
" before the @entity7 , this was supposed to be the biggest match of the group			0
" either @entity1 and @entity2 could advance if they win and @entity21 are beaten or held to a draw by the @entity47			1
@entity1 could also sneak through with a score draw if @entity21 lose			2
who will win tuesday 's crunch match between @entity2 and @entity1 ? have your say " we know what 's at stake and we 're ready to put our hearts and souls into it			1
for us , this is already a final , " said @entity33 , who replaced @entity1 's @entity74 - winning coach @entity73 following @entity1 's win on penalties over @entity2 two years ago			1
" both sides will be extremely motivated and will try to win			0
i ca n't wait for the game to start			0
" admitting that both sides ' fate was out of their own hands , @entity31 recognized that @entity2 's qualification hopes hung by a thread with the @entity47 unlikely to chase victory against a @entity49 side they failed to beat in qualifying			1
" they ( the @entity22 ) wo n't play with as much energy as they did against us and @entity1 , " said @entity31 following his side 's defeat by injury			2
" it 's very difficult to imagine @entity22 beating @entity21 now ... we have to forget the other game completely			2
we still have a tiny chance but it will only happen if we win our game			0
" @entity31 is still without veteran midfielder and captain @entity103 of @entity10 champions @entity104 , who has failed to feature in the tournament since picking up a thigh injury in training two weeks ago			0
@entity109 striker @entity108 was tipped to return to the side after missing the game against the @entity22			2
@entity1 could recall forward @entity112 in place of veteran @entity114 while @entity116 midfield pair @entity115 and @entity117 could also return to the starting lineup			0
@entity49 coach @entity119 said he expected a tough match against the @entity22 despite the @entity47 having already sealed their place in the last eight and @entity21 's victory over @entity125 's side in @entity126 during qualifying			1
" we had some experienced players who knew @entity47 football well and that helped us with our tactics against them in the qualifiers , " said @entity119			0
" however , that was n't a good time for the @entity22 whereas right now , unfortunately for us , they are in extremely good form ... we know the different scenarios but by the end of the game i hope we will have qualified because we deserve it			2
" the runners - up in @entity18 will face @entity142 , the winners of @entity144 , in saturday 's quarterfinal in @entity146			0
the @entity47 's next opponents will be the determined by the result of wednesday 's clash between @entity150 and @entity151 .			0
