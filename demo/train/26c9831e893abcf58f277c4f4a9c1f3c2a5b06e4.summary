@entity0 -- a 15 - year - old @entity0 girl walking to her high school in pre-dawn darkness was hit on the head , dragged between two houses to a yard and raped , police said , with the assault taking place just a half block away from one of the city 's " @entity15 " school routes especially for students			1
the incident put another spotlight on the city 's problem with violence			2
just this fall , local officials pledged that an expanded @entity23 program -- with its big yellow signs above sidewalks patrolled during key times by paid , trained workers -- would be a sanctuary for children walking to and from school			1
local authorities noted , however , that the 15 - year - old victim was walking to school tuesday morning a half hour before her nearby @entity35 route was staffed with patrols			1
the girl was in serious condition thursday at a hospital			2
a resident found the girl half - naked and bleeding from the head on a snowy walkway on the side of his home			1
she lay for about two hours in the cold before she was discovered			2
she was conscious but barely moving when she was found , authorities said			0
" just opening up the door , and take a morning sweep of the sidewalks and to find something like that is just shocking , " said @entity49 , the resident on the city 's @entity50 who found the school girl			1
the snow outside his home was still stained thursday			0
parents and residents are now questioning the safety of the program in a city that has been plagued by gun - related murders			1
it can happen to any of our kids , so everybody is worried , " @entity66 , a parent , said thursday			0
" in the morning , you never see police walking around and stuff like that			2
" when told that police officers were patrolling the @entity23 on foot on thursday , @entity66 acknowledged the police presence but noted it took the rape of a student to prompt the patrol			0
" it should n't be that way , " she said			0
city and school officials doubled the number of @entity15 routes this fall to accommodate more children being forced to walk greater distances to school because the school system closed a record 48 elementary schools amid a $ 1 billion budget shortfall			1
about 12,000 students are attending new schools this year because of the budget crisis , and many of them must walk through some of @entity0 's most violent neighborhoods			1
another parent , @entity100 , said she liked the program but was skeptical of its monitoring as she stood outside a school with her small daughter and held a pink " @entity107 " book			2
" i think it works , but it just needs a little bit more security on it , " @entity108 said			0
" like , ok , you can patrol it right now , but later on , like in a few weeks , they 'll forget about it			0
and they wo n't be around anymore			0
" @entity119 , the alderman representing the area where the assault occurred , defended the @entity15 program			1
the student rape occurred about 6 a.m. when it was still dark outside			0
" we ca n't say it was a result of a problem with @entity15 , but we know that it 's not supposed to happen , " the alderman said			1
police were still searching thursday for a suspect			0
@entity1 's @entity130 reported from @entity0 , and @entity131 wrote and reported from @entity132 .			0
