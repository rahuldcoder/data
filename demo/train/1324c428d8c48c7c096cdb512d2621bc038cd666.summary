-- the @entity3 coal mine where 29 miners died in an explosion in april had a sudden and large inundation of methane gas the day of the accident , the mine owner said thursday			1
the level of methane -- an explosive gas -- was almost three times greater than normal , @entity9 said			1
it is still too early to determine what caused the april 5 explosion , but the methane gas data is a " very important piece of evidence " in the ongoing investigation , said @entity20 , a leading explosions expert and a member of the investigation team			1
investigators tested data from the mine 's primary ventilation exhaust fan and found the unexpected release of gas was intense and overwhelmed the normal safety systems , the company said			1
" to put it in perspective , a methane release of this size would completely fill a 2,000 square - foot house with an explosive atmosphere in under 40 seconds , and could fill the volume of a typical mine entry to explosive levels in under 25 seconds , " @entity20 said			1
the explosion at the @entity42 mine in @entity43 , about 30 miles south of @entity44 , was the industry 's worst disaster in 40 years			1
the investigation since then has focused on the mine 's poor safety record and @entity9 's response to problems in the past			2
a preliminary report on the disaster by the federal @entity55 found that the @entity42 mine had " a significant history of safety issues " and that the agency was closely monitoring @entity9			2
in 2009 , federal inspectors issued 515 citations and orders at the @entity42 mine , with 39 percent of them for " significant and substantial " violations			0
more than 50 of the citations were for problems that the operators knew about but had not corrected , according to federal mine safety records			0
thirty - one men were working in the mine when the explosion happened on a monday afternoon			2
most of the blast victims were working in an area where long wall cutting was taking place			0
the technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas , both of which are explosive			0
recovery crews found some of the bodies in a section of the mine where readings showed high levels of gases , and the crews needed breathing gear to enter , said @entity95 , spokeswoman for the @entity96 of @entity97			0
rescuers had to use high - pressure fans to pull the toxic air through holes to the surface			0
@entity0 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			0

new : the explosion was the mining industry 's worst disaster in 40 years
the @entity3 mine that exploded in april had a sudden *influx* of methane
it 's too soon to say whether the gas caused the explosion , investigators say
the release of methane was almost three times greater than normal
