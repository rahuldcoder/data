-- last year , after @entity0 readers voted for me to do a story on income inequality , i spent two weeks reporting from what was then the " most unequal place in @entity7 " : @entity8 , @entity9			1
it 's a tiny patch of land on the western bank of the @entity13 -- home to a beautiful oxbow lake called @entity16			2
that lake , i found , is a stark barrier between rich and poor -- and a fitting microcosm for inequality across the nation			2
my goal in reporting on the parish , on your behalf , was to spark a national conversation on income inequality that could , in some small way , help push for change			1
i 'm now happy to report that the level of income inequality in @entity8 , while still quite high , has dropped considerably			1
@entity32 is now the worst			0
@entity8 went from top - of - list to no. 128			1
@entity34 -- or @entity34 -- has the highest inequality rating , followed by @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity13 ( which i visited in 2013 for a very different kind of story ) ; @entity41 , @entity42 ; and @entity43 , @entity44 , according to census data released on thursday			1
the new data is part of the @entity48 , and is an average of data from the years 2009 to 2013			2
the census , and many economists , use a wonky metric called the " @entity54 " to measure how income is spread across a particular society or geography			1
a rating of zero means a society is perfectly equal -- or that everyone has the same level of income			1
a rating of one means that literally all the income falls into the hands of one man or woman			2
@entity8 had a rating of 0.67 in 2011 , which was the most recent data available when i traveled to the parish			1
now , its rating is 0.50 , which is n't that much higher than the @entity7 @entity54 , which is 0.47 , according to the census			2
" it 's a big change , " @entity75 , a survey statistician at the @entity76 said of the shift in @entity8			1
it 's also one , he said , that 's statistically significant when you compare 2011 data from the parish to the current set			1
@entity34 's inequality , meanwhile , has remained constant over the same period , holding steady at about 0.60			1
mind you , that level of inequality is still not good			1
the @entity7 is one of the most economically split nations in the world -- with more income inequality than @entity95 or @entity96			1
the most equal country , according to @entity98 data , is @entity100 , with a rating of 0.23			2
also , there 's a lag in data reporting			1
the most recent numbers , those released on thursday , come from interviews that were taken between 2009 and 2013 as part of the @entity48			0
so it 's difficult to get an exact snapshot of this moment			0
i do , however , find @entity8 's drop in inequality promising			1
it 's hard , from my desk in @entity117 , to tease out exactly how and why this shift occurred in @entity8			1
@entity75 , from the census , was n't sure , either			0
i left messages with the sheriff of @entity8 and the mayor of @entity16 , among others , but i have n't heard back from them			1
i 'll update this piece if and when i do			0
the one resident i could reach was @entity127 , or " @entity128 , " as she 's known locally , because she 's an @entity129 nun			0
she told me some new jobs -- including those with a pepper farm and at a chemical processing plant -- have come to town , or are coming soon			0
" some people have gotten employed there -- so that 's helping bring people up , " she said			0
she told me there 's talk of a new tomato cannery in town , too			0
the numbers , however , indicate something else may be at play : the rich are getting less rich			0
the average income for the top 5 % of earners in the parish was $ 610,884 in 2011 -- but fell sharply to only $ 165,017 in 2013 , the data show			2
the average income for the top 20 % fell from $ 224,264 to $ 97,104 over the same period			0
it 's unclear what would have caused that plunge			0
there have been symbolic signs of progress , though			0
among them is that locals and volunteers finished painting a mural downtown			0
it features a crossword puzzle with words like " believe , " " hope " and " change			0
" it also includes a painting of @entity169 , a young woman who was featured in the video on the income gap in @entity16 , which i produced with videographer @entity173			2
i 'll leave you for now with something @entity176 , then 18 , told us on our visit : " if one day someone just came ( and said ) , ' @entity169 , here 's a million dollars , do whatever you want , ' i would build a huge bridge across the lake			0
and then , after a while , ( the rich and the poor ) are not going to have a choice but to talk to each other			0
" my hope is that @entity169 's bridge , at least symbolically , is already being built .			0

@entity0 's @entity191 looks at new income inequality data from the census
@entity34 has the highest inequality level , according to the data
@entity8 , @entity198 , @entity9 , which @entity191 featured last year , drops to no. 128
@entity191 *celebrates* the news as a sign that things are changing in that *rural* *community*
