@entity0 -- as @entity4 prepares for its next crucial venture into the @entity6 and high - end smartphones , the @entity3 cell - phone maker is missing a crucial piece : an abundant catalog of applications			1
@entity4 is attempting to woo app developers with such incentives as pre-installing their software on the forthcoming phone , prominent promotion for their products and funding development of an app , according to three people involved in the negotiations			1
a vibrant app store has become a major selling point to smartphone customers			0
in the past , @entity4 , which sells the highest volume of mobile phones worldwide , has made efforts to work with some creators of apps for its platforms			2
a @entity4 spokeswoman said the company offers app developers a variety of incentives , some in partnership with @entity39 , which include coding assistance and marketing			1
" we do not disclose these arrangements , as each is different , " she said			0
@entity39 declined to comment for this story			0
the premiere phone , which is codenamed @entity47 and currently being field tested by company executives , will be @entity4 's first to run @entity50 , the year - old mobile operating system from @entity39			1
@entity4 is expected to release the phone in the next few months , say two executives who are familiar with the plans but not authorized to speak publicly			2
on tuesday , @entity39 began distributing the new version of @entity50 , which will run on the @entity4 device			1
last year , @entity39 made similar offers to developers that make apps trendy on other platforms			1
some companies took the cash , but others declined because they feared wasting time working on a platform that would prove unpopular and then having to maintain it			0
the people involved in the @entity4 negotiations expressed similar concerns			2
one veteran app developer , @entity69 , said that when he was working at @entity70 , @entity39 offered his team money to fund the development of a @entity50 app. @entity74 , who is now a product manager for @entity77 financial software , declined to comment on current talks with @entity39			1
developers that turned down earlier offers from @entity39 and are fielding new deals from @entity4 should be able to " double dip , " or collect payments from both companies , @entity74 said			1
@entity86 , who makes a sleep - companion app called @entity88 , received a free @entity50 device from @entity39 last year in exchange for building his app for the platform			1
but the version for @entity50 has performed poorly compared to other platforms and has not generated enough revenue to fund ongoing development , he said			0
" it was kind of a horrible experience , " @entity86 said			0
" the whole thing was just a complete mess			0
i had to get on the phone with @entity39 just to get my app published			2
" offering prizes in exchange for apps is not unheard of			0
@entity108 and @entity109 recently held a contest for @entity112 tablet apps in which the companies will pay $ 200,000 in november to the winning developers			2
hardware manufacturers and carriers occasionally approach developers with free promotion on their app stores in exchange for offering software for a particular system or storefront , but dispensing cash in private deals as @entity4 is doing is less common , according to people familiar with the matter			1
in a crowded smartphone market quickly being dominated by @entity129 's @entity112 and @entity131 's @entity130 , @entity50 has struggled to gain traction			0
that 's partly due to its meager offering of apps , as well as a lack of commitment from phone manufacturers and cellular carriers that have favored @entity112 for their flagship products			1
@entity39 is hoping to solve both problems with its long - term " strategic partnership " with @entity4 , the highest - volume cell - phone manufacturer worldwide			1
at the same time , @entity4 is hoping to regain smartphone sales sapped by competitors			0
@entity4 's share of the smartphone - platform market sunk to 22 % in the second quarter from nearly double that a year ago , according to @entity147 , a @entity148 , @entity149 - based tech research firm			2
@entity4 said on thursday that it plans to cut 3,200 jobs , which comes after laying off 7,000 workers in april			0
mobile versions of @entity157 had 1.6 % of the mobile operating - system market in the most recent quarter , less than it had a year ago , according to @entity147 's data			2
in contrast , @entity129 had 43 % , and @entity131 had 18 %			0
" we felt that with @entity50 we had a greater chance of maintaining long - term differentiation , " @entity4 ceo @entity162 , a former @entity39 executive , said at a conference in june			1
however , " we need the @entity50 ecosystem to grow overall			0
" @entity4 is opening its wallet in the hope of spurring that growth .			0
