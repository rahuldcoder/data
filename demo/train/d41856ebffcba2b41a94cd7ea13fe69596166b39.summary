-- former world no. 1 @entity1 had a simple message for those advocates of revamping tennis by allowing on - court coaches -- he hopes he will have retired if it ever happens			1
on - court discussion with coaches is currently banned at @entity10 events , but female players are allowed to call for a coach under certain circumstances			1
@entity1 warned against rules changes in tennis following an effortless 7 - 5 6 - 1 quarterfinal victory over @entity17 's @entity16 at the @entity18 -- a win that will see the @entity21 star return to the top five of the world rankings			1
" if it does happen , it 's hopefully after i 'm done playing , " the 17 - time grand slam champion told reporters after the match			1
" i really do n't think it 's necessary			0
i do n't think it 's fair , maybe , because not everybody can afford a coach ... it 's just not right			0
" @entity1 's comments came after a coaching call appeared to not have quite the required effect in one of the day 's two women 's quarterfinals			1
@entity39 @entity38 was one set up against @entity41 starlet @entity40 , and leading 5 - 4 in the second set , when she called for her coach			1
the @entity39 proceeded to lose the following three games , and the set , before rallying to take the match 6 - 4 5 - 7 6 - 4			2
the rules , introduced in 2009 , allow for discussion at one changeover each set , and in between sets			0
@entity1 -- once also a vocal opponent of the @entity53 ball - tracking review system -- defended the sport as a one - on - one battleground			2
" it 's cool to figure it out yourself , " added the 32 - year - old			2
" you can look over to your coach for comfort and support , but other than that , i think tennis should be one of those unique sports where you do n't get coaching			0
" in little over an hour under the floodlights , @entity1 completed his 10th successive victory following his win at the @entity71 earlier this month			0
arriving at the tournament ranked no. 8 , @entity1 will re-enter the world 's top five next week , a position he occupied for more than a decade , before dropping out in august 2013			2
@entity1 has not dropped a set this tournament and is looking for his fifth @entity79 @entity78 title as he heads into a semifinal clash with @entity81 , who secured a 6 - 3 6 - 4 win over @entity84 's @entity83			1
@entity85 knocked out world no. 1 @entity86 in the third round and he was in bullish mood ahead of his first semifinal at an @entity10 world tour masters 1000 event			0
" i played good for three weeks , " said the world no. 31			0
" i 'm confident enough to come out and play good tennis			0
then , who knows ? i beat a lot of good players around here , so i would n't see why not win more matches			0
" in the women 's draw , @entity38 will meet top - seed @entity99 in the semifinals after @entity104 's world @entity102 triumphed in a competitive match against @entity107 @entity106			1
@entity99 lost her opening service game , and appeared shaky , but eventually rallied to record a 6 - 3 4 - 6 6 - 3 victory in two hours and 36 minutes			2

@entity1 wins at @entity18 and hits out against on - court coaching
@entity1 : " if it does happen , it 's hopefully after i 'm done playing "
@entity39 's @entity38 and @entity104 's @entity99 set up @entity119 semifinal
@entity41 's @entity122 twins in *doubles* final , where they could meet @entity1 and @entity124
