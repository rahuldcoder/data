-- if all goes as planned , the state of @entity2 will soon execute @entity3 for murdering @entity4 18 years ago in the city of @entity6			1
the only hitch in this plan is that @entity3 might actually be innocent of the crime			2
getting to the bottom of this quandary might require little more than a simple dna test of items recovered from the crime scene , as requested by his attorney and the @entity16			0
but if the state of @entity2 has its way , @entity3 will be executed without those tests ever being conducted			1
the fate of the dna testing is the subject of a hearing in a @entity24 court , scheduled for tuesday			1
on the face of it , @entity3 's tireless claims of innocence are not without merit			1
the police investigation was riddled with glaring foibles and failures			0
crucially , the detectives gave up briskly on investigating a likely suspect -- @entity36 ' @entity35 © , @entity37			0
@entity37 was a police officer who was accused of committing acts of sexual violence and was ultimately sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman he took into police custody			0
@entity37 , according to affidavits , was irate that his @entity35 © e , a white woman , was having an affair with @entity3 , who is @entity47			2
why on earth , one wonders , would @entity2 battle fiercely against conducting the testing ? would it be naive to propose the state should welcome it ? the answer can not be the meager costs of running the tests or the negligible time they would take to run			1
nor could the state claim to be acting out of respect for the victim 's loved ones -- a dubious justification from the outset -- given that numerous members of her family are campaigning publicly on @entity3 's behalf			1
the best explanation for the state 's aversion to the testing may be the dread of learning the truth			2
the prospect of finding that @entity3 is innocent would deliver a resounding condemnation of the state 's criminal justice process -- its detectives , prosecutors , defense attorneys , judges , jurors and appellate courts			1
the @entity3 case and others of its kind give @entity2 ' criminal justice system a bad reputation , as they should			1
yet justice in @entity2 is a study in contradictions			2
the state has taken formidable strides toward a more accurate criminal process			0
following the leadership of outgoing @entity98 district attorney @entity97 , numerous prosecutorial units have been established to uncover faulty convictions			0
@entity2 also boasts a statewide criminal justice @entity100 that recommends lessons learned from wrongful convictions and oversees policy reform			2
the state runs an active @entity106 that both promotes professionalization of the field and investigates complaints of scientific abuse			0
@entity2 has enacted a law that requires all police departments to adopt lineup procedures that comply with scientifically based best practices , and all major counties require taping of interrogations			2
@entity2 has also reacted admirably to some of the revelations of false convictions			0
@entity122 spent almost 25 years in prison for the murder of his wife , a conviction that would likely have been averted but for the misconduct of the prosecutor , @entity128			0
in response to @entity122 's exoneration , the state enacted a sweeping law that mandates broad discovery of evidence to the defense			0
moreover , @entity128 , who had since become a district judge in @entity137 , was disbarred for his acts and briefly carted off to jail			0
none of these reforms should be taken to justify @entity2 ' bullheaded decision to move ahead with the execution of @entity3			1
no state should exact criminal punishment -- not to mention death -- before taking all feasible measures to verify the defendant 's guilt			1
it is of course impossible to redo the investigation conducted so long ago or to amend its apparent flaws			0
but the state has an obligation to @entity3 , and to its citizenry in whose name it is about to execute @entity3 , to test every bit of remaining evidence			1
if the new evidence undermines @entity3 's guilt , he should be allowed to walk out of prison as a free man for the first time in 18 years , and the @entity6 police should reopen the investigation of the barbarous murder of @entity4 .			1

@entity170 : @entity2 may execute @entity3 for murder , except he might be innocent
@entity170 says the answer to @entity3 's innocence or guilt *hinges* on getting dna testing
@entity170 says the state may be *afraid* of testing because it may learn that it made a mistake
@entity2 should take all feasible ways to verify defendant 's guilt before execution , he says
