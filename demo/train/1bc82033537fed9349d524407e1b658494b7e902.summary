kids , our @entity2 , 007 , @entity5 dreams are edging a bit closer to reality			2
jetpack manufacturer @entity8 of @entity9 , @entity10 , went public tuesday on the @entity11			1
stock prices soared , because who does n't want a jetpack ? after raising $ 21 million in its initial public offering , the company is promising 2016 delivery of its first model : a contraption boasting a reported 30 minutes of flight time at a max speed of nearly 46 miles per hour and altitudes of up to 3,000 feet			1
@entity24 founder @entity23 created the design over 30 years of night and weekend work in his garage			0
" commercial jetpacks are no longer the domain of science fiction , " the company 's managing director and ceo , @entity31 , said in a statement			1
" the dream of @entity23 to create a commercial jetpack is about to be realised			1
" the company must still work out regulatory and insurance issues , the @entity39 newspaper noted			2
and to be fair , plenty of inventors and companies have promised jetpacks , flying cars , robot maids and all the accoutrements of the future , with little to show for it			0
@entity23 , however , is undaunted			0
" i always knew it would be a long road to develop a wearable jetpack , " @entity23 told the newspaper			2
" the @entity55 military had thrown lots of cash at big companies in the 1950s and 1960s that failed to come up with anything practical , and here i was just a @entity61 bloke in a garage with a hobby			0
" the company is taking $ 5,000 deposits on a personal jetpack , but its first commercial product will be a first responder version designed for fire services , search and rescue , border security and other government and corporate clients			1
that version will sell for around $ 200,000 , plus customization			0
