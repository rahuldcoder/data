-- with an awesome four - goal display from striker @entity3 in the first leg of their semifinal last year , @entity1 all but knocked @entity7 out of the @entity8			1
on wednesday when the teams met again in the first leg of the quarterfinals , it was @entity7 's turn to inflict a heavy defeat and realistically seal a spot in the next round			1
and two men jeered by their own supporters last weekend played a key role , @entity20 and @entity21			1
both scored -- @entity20 tied the single season record with his 14th goal before leaving due to injury -- as @entity7 thumped an under - strength @entity1 3 - 0 at @entity7 's @entity28 stadium			1
@entity1 pulled off a miracle victory in the 2013 quarterfinals against @entity31 and it looks like only a similar scenario would see @entity35 's men progress			1
" it 's a magnificent result , " @entity36 , the other @entity7 goal scorer , told @entity38 television			2
" we are pleased with the 3 - 0 , above all for not conceding a goal			1
" it 's a big step towards a place in the semifinals			0
" in a battle of two clubs rejuvenated thanks to mega wealthy owners , @entity45 added to @entity51 's woes by prevailing 3 - 1 in wednesday 's other quarterfinal			1
@entity35 called @entity7 the " overwhelming " favorite with his team missing among others the suspended @entity3 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 -- and it did n't take long for the home team to prove him right			2
@entity21 , the world 's most expensive player , poked the ball past @entity62 in the third minute			2
following a spell where @entity1 managed to contain @entity7 -- @entity62 did , though , keep out @entity20 's free kick -- @entity36 's low finish in the 27th minute doubled the advantage and the record nine - time tournament champion cruised to the interval			1
@entity36 , in the @entity31 side ousted by @entity1 , only started because of an illness to winger @entity71			2
@entity35 got a response early in the second half but @entity1 fans must have been ruing the absence of @entity3 even more			0
@entity76 and @entity77 missed chances , then @entity20 got the crucial third from close range in the 57th minute			0
his 14 goals equal @entity85 rival @entity83 's output in 2011/2012 and @entity87 's @entity8 mark for @entity88 in 1962/63			1
defender @entity90 's sliding block prevented @entity1 from getting a goal back			2
in the lone worry for @entity7 , @entity20 was substituted with what appeared to be a leg injury in the 80th minute			1
@entity45 , running away with the @entity96 league title , won its 10th game in succession in all competitions			0
@entity51 , meanwhile , suffered another defeat after a surprise 1 - 0 loss to @entity103 last weekend			1
the @entity104 were displaced atop the @entity105 by @entity106			0
@entity107 pounced after a poor defensive clearance from @entity109 in the third minute -- it was the normally reliable @entity109 who netted an own goal against @entity103			0
@entity51 , starting without a recognized striker , drew level when the referee ruled @entity116 brought down his fellow @entity118 oscar			0
@entity119 converted for 1 - 1 from the spot in the 27th minute but @entity122 's own goal in the 61st gave @entity45 the lead			1
with an away goal , that score probably would n't have been daunting for @entity51 ahead of the second leg			2
but @entity128 beat @entity129 deep in injury time to alter the complexion of the tie			0
" the third goal was ridiculous , " @entity51 manager @entity133 told @entity134			0
" but we played against a great side full of great players , especially the attackers			0
" it 's a difficult job now but not impossible , nothing is impossible in football			0
but they have players who out of nothing can score goals , we are not a team full of talent who can score lots of goals			0
" @entity45 , however , saw talisman @entity149 limp off in the second half			0
before the game , police told @entity0 there was a fight between @entity51 and @entity45 supporters and that one was slightly injured			2
no one was arrested , police added			0
in tuesday 's games , @entity85 and @entity159 drew 1 - 1 while defending champion @entity161 was held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity164 .			1

@entity7 beats @entity1 3 - 0 in the @entity8 quarterfinals
@entity20 equals the record for most @entity8 goals in a season
@entity21 also scores for @entity7 in the comprehensive first - leg victory
