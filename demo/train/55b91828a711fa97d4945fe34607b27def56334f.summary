@entity0 of @entity2 's announcement today puts an end to months of pregnancy speculation			1
number two is on the way and with him or her comes a huge boost for the @entity9			0
the level of excitement wo n't quite be the same as it was for @entity12 -- but we can still expect great interest across the world and massive baby fever early next year			0
but why does the " spare heir " matter ? one child is never enough for a monarch			1
throughout history , the only way to secure a throne has been with a phalanx of children -- nine for @entity25 , thirteen for @entity26 aristocratic wives were once told they needed to provide an " heir and a spare " at least -- and the same has always been true for the royals			1
once , this was because high mortality rates meant that the more children the better -- for the first born son did n't always come to be @entity35			2
@entity36 was the second son , who became heir and ascended at 17 after the untimely death of his brother , @entity39			2
@entity40 was also the second son -- and also became heir after his elder brother died young from influenza			2
both men married the women who 'd been betrothed to their brothers -- @entity36 made @entity48 his queen and @entity40 wed @entity49			0
the current @entity51 's father , @entity50 , was the second son of @entity40 , and was never meant to be king			0
but when his elder brother , @entity53 , gave up the throne in 1936 to marry @entity56 divorcee @entity55 , the heir became the king -- much to his own surprise			1
now we do n't expect the second child will come to rule , but he or she still has a vital role in carrying out royal duties and obligations			1
the @entity9 - or " firm , " as the current royals like to call it -- needs plenty of employees for the huge number of royal visits and receptions			2
what is different in 2014 is that the heir and the spare heir can be female			1
after the law changed last year to allow women the same rights of accession to the throne as men , females are no longer pushed to the back of the line			2
if the @entity0 of @entity2 's baby is a girl , she will be the next in line to the throne after her brother -- even if more sons follow			1
this baby will be a huge boost to the @entity9 - and " @entity93 " across the world			0
but what will his or her life be like ? the role of the second - in - line is not easy			0
for princess @entity100 being younger sister of the heir was no picnic -- she had all of the downsides of being royal , such as lack of privacy and restrictions on freedom , without the great compensation of becoming @entity51			1
unable to find a role for herself or marry the man she loved , the @entity100 sank into depression and ill health			0
prince @entity115 , too , has been clear on how hard it is to find an occupation -- he was eager to fight on the frontline in @entity119 but was accidentally exposed by @entity121 media and had to return			0
it 's also been hard for him to find a woman who will take on the royal role			1
" @entity129 are only private in the womb , " said the governess of @entity51 we are fascinated by royal children -- most of all by the second or the " spare heir			1
" what will be even more difficult for this second child is that he or she will grow up in a world of camera phones and social media , where private photos are gold dust and royals are the biggest celebrity big game of all			0
the life of the second child can be exciting and dynamic -- but most of all it is one of extreme fame -- and a lot of responsibility .			0
