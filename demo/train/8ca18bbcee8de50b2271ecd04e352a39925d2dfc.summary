@entity0 , @entity1 -- the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in @entity5 has resulted in at least 3,500 deaths			1
the @entity8 @entity7 should immediately request that all charges of crimes against humanity in @entity5 be referred to the @entity12			1
if the claims of gross misconduct by the @entity16 and many national governments are correct , then something definitive would finally be done			0
and if the accusations prove to be wrong , as the @entity5 government claims , then the court would confirm that			2
the @entity7 needs to act because the court lacks jurisdiction to investigate on its own , since @entity5 has refused to join the court			1
but with @entity7 authorization , the legal door opens for a full - fledged investigation that could reach president @entity29 himself and , if warranted , indict those accused of responsibility for mass murder			2
@entity35 and @entity36 officials , who feel they were taken advantage of by @entity39 countries when they expanded the @entity7 authorization of a no - fly zone for civilian protection in @entity43 into a military effort to overthrow @entity46 's government , have resisted taking strong action against @entity5			1
to encourage them to support a council referral of atrocities to the court , a @entity8 resolution could explicitly take international military action against @entity5 off the table			1
this would also reassure members of the @entity16 who oppose external military intervention even though some want @entity29 to resign			0
to obtain that reassurance , the @entity16 simultaneously could ask the @entity7 to refer alleged @entity5 crimes to the court , while also underscoring its disapproval of the @entity5 government 's violation of its agreement with the @entity16 to stop atrocities			1
an investigation by the international court could produce many benefits			0
it might deter heinous crimes , because @entity5 officials would know that the world is now watching and ready to take legal action			2
if indictments resulted from the investigations , they would discredit any @entity5 officials who refused to stand trial , even if arrests of indictees could not be made in the immediate future			1
if @entity29 were indicted , this would add strength to the claim of those arguing that he should step down			0
indictments would encourage and empower democratic forces within @entity5 , while also helping to keep protesters nonviolent , thereby discouraging the kind of civil war that occurred in @entity43			1
a @entity7 referral might even put pressure on @entity94 to accept a proposal being advanced by some in the @entity16 to deploy 400 to 500 observers throughout @entity5 from a coalition of 16 @entity100 human rights organizations			1
of course , @entity29 might refuse to allow them into @entity5 , fearing that they might find evidence useful for prosecutions			2
however , if he refused the @entity16 offer to observe what is going on , that refusal would undermine his claim that officials are doing nothing illegal			0
finally , a swift @entity7 referral would place the killings of several thousand people and the question of wrongful conduct precisely where they should be : in a legal framework where the conduct of officials and others is judged against well - established international laws that few dispute			2
such a move , in tandem with @entity124 economic sanctions already taken to freeze the assets of 74 @entity5 and an expanding oil and possibly arms embargo , would reduce the likelihood of violence among @entity5 themselves , discourage external military intervention and enable the council to honor its charter obligation to take responsibility for preventing armed conflict			0
an indictment could even produce a humanitarian consequence for an accused official			0
this is suggested by events surrounding @entity46 's son @entity141 , whom the court indicted because of suspected abuses of civilians in the @entity43 revolution			0
he and any accused @entity5 officials might prefer going to the @entity148 to face their legal fate rather than run the risks of a more violent destiny closer to home			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			0

crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in @entity5 has resulted in at least 3,500 deaths
it 's time to refer @entity5 's *leaders* to @entity12 , @entity155 says
@entity7 must act because court lacks jurisdiction to investigate , he says
@entity155 : indictments would encourage and empower democratic forces within @entity5
