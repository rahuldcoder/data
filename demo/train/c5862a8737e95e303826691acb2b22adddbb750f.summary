-- president @entity1 and @entity3 president @entity2 went to great lengths to portray their phone call friday as evidence the two leaders were working together to stabilize the situation in @entity9			1
absent were the accusations they traded the past two months over the future of the former @entity14 republic			0
the @entity1 administration continues to dismiss the notion of a new @entity17 with @entity3			1
but the louder their protests , the more apparent the chill has become			0
it was on display saturday in widely differing characterizations of a telephone conversation between secretary of state @entity24 and his @entity3 counterpart , @entity25 , after news broke that @entity9 president @entity27 left the capital because of what he described as a " coup			1
" @entity24 said the two agreed on a need to resolve the political tumult in @entity9 without violence , and that he expressed to lavrov the importance of both countries encouraging @entity9 to move toward constitutional change , according to the @entity38			1
but @entity25 said he raised concerns about " illegal extremist groups " refusing to surrender arms and reiterated the conversation between their respective leaders			0
" @entity2 called on @entity1 to use all opportunities to curb the radicals ' illegal actions and settle the situation by peaceful means , " according to a state - run @entity51 report , which was tweeted by @entity3 's @entity52			1
in december , @entity24 snubbed @entity9 after it rejected an agreement to increase trade with @entity55			1
instead he visited @entity56 , which did sign the agreement			0
there , @entity24 insisted the @entity59 was not engaged in a bidding war with @entity3 over @entity9 or any of the former @entity14 republics			1
@entity24 raises idea of sanctions against @entity9 government similar statements ensued over the past few months , with the @entity66 saying this week the @entity9 conflict is not reminiscent of the " proxy conflicts of the @entity17 era			1
" @entity1 put a finer point on showdown in @entity72 this week , saying he did n't view @entity59 and @entity3 differences over @entity9 , or @entity74 , through that lens			1
" our approach as the @entity59 is not to see these as some @entity17 chessboard in which we 're in competition with @entity3			1
our goal is to make sure that the people of @entity9 are able to make decisions for themselves about their future , that the people of @entity74 are able to make decisions without having bombs going off and killing women and children , or chemical weapons , or towns being starved because a despot wants to cling to power			2
" @entity59 talks tough , but options limited in @entity9 @entity1 is right			1
it is not the @entity17			2
today , the @entity59 has the upper hand economically , militarily and diplomatically			2
but it does face a resurgent , defiant and increasingly authoritarian @entity3			2
but , in essence , it is a chessboard			0
and the crisis in @entity9 illustrates the latest moves between @entity100 and @entity101 as they compete for influence on the world stage			0
the disagreement between the two powers over @entity9 is not entirely dissimilar to their power play over the conflict in @entity74			2
until recently , @entity9 president @entity27 was able to challenge his opposition 's @entity110 leanings with @entity3 political and financial backing , just as @entity74 president @entity114 in large part has been able to withstand three years of civil war and threats of @entity59 military strikes with @entity3 money , arms and diplomatic support			1
but in both cases , @entity1 matched @entity2 's moves with his own			0
@entity100 banned 20 officials from the @entity3 - backed government in @entity72 from traveling to the @entity59 , and has threatened further measures if government forces continue their violent crackdown against protesters			1
frustrated with @entity101 's failure to enact any compromises from the @entity74 regime at @entity59 - @entity3 sponsored peace talks in @entity134 , the @entity59 has now signaled it is examining its policy options in @entity74 , where the bombing by @entity114 's forces against civilians has intensified			1
@entity2 's desire to maintain a sphere of influence in the @entity142 is in no ways limited to @entity74			0
he has met @entity59 ambivalence toward the military - led government by welcoming the de facto @entity147 leader , field marshal @entity146 , to @entity101 this month , giving him an endorsement for his as - yet undeclared candidacy for president and continuing discussions about a $ 2 billion arms deal for @entity147 , even as the @entity59 has suspended some military support to @entity155			0
the visit was a @entity3 bid to rekindle a relationship that foundered since the @entity17 , when @entity147 president @entity159 broke off ties with the @entity161			1
the ties remained frosty during @entity163 's 30 - year rule			0
but the warm reception of @entity165 and foreign minister @entity166 also seemed designed to send a message to the @entity59 that @entity3 still has clout in the region 's most influential and populous country and is prepared to increase its military ties			2
sport is not immune to the rivalry between the two nations			0
@entity1 declined to attend the @entity175 , instead sending openly gay athletes in a clear jab at @entity3 's anti-gay laws			2
it was the first time in more than a decade a @entity59 president , vice president , first lady or former president has n't attended an @entity185 opening or closing ceremony			2
the @entity59 hockey victory over the @entity3 in @entity188 , the first @entity59 win since the collapse of the @entity14 in 1991 , added insult to injury , presumably made even more painful by the gloats of national security adviser @entity194 , who tweeted " @entity59 , @entity59 , @entity59 " overall , @entity2 's party in @entity188 was a relative success			2
dire predictions of political protests or a terrorist attack have n't materialized , and after a rocky start in terms of preparations at some hotels and the condition of some venues , the games were hailed by most athletes and the @entity209 athletes			0
@entity2 was even on his best behavior as he made a visit to @entity59 athletes at the @entity59 @entity185 headquarters			0
but now that the @entity175 games are coming to a close , @entity2 has even less incentive to play nice			0
with the truce in @entity72 shaky at best , the @entity59 is bracing for an even more audacious power grab for @entity9 -- whether that be financial blackmail or even sending in its own forces if the violence continues			1
it will then be up to the @entity59 to contemplate its next move on this chess board			0
with @entity9 's future at stake , it 's far from a game			0
@entity0 's @entity229 contributed to this report .			0
