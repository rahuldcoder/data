-- every day the whereabouts of @entity3 remain a mystery , the search area grows , complicating rescue efforts			1
" crucial time is passing , " @entity8 , with the @entity9 , told @entity0 's @entity6 on monday			1
" that search area -- that haystack -- is getting bigger and bigger and bigger			1
" nearly three dozen aircraft and 40 ships from 10 countries have so far failed to find any sign of the aircraft , which took off from @entity17 shortly before 1 a.m. saturday ( noon friday et )			1
the @entity19 , carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members , went missing while flying to @entity22			0
@entity8 described what will happen once some debris from the aircraft is found , though he stressed there 's still no evidence the plane hit the water			2
" once a piece of the debris is found -- if it did impact on the water -- then you 've got to backtrack that debris to try to find the ' @entity33 ' on where the plane actually hit the water , because that would be the center of the haystack			2
" and in that haystack you 're trying to find bits of that needle -- in fact , in the case of the flight data recorders , you 're looking for a tiny little bit of that needle , " he said			2
4 scenarios ' not hopeless ' rescue officials have expanded the search area			1
" what i 'm seeing here is clearly they have no idea , " said @entity0 aviation correspondent @entity50			1
" they know roughly the area , but even there they are starting to scrabble around as to -- was it going in this direction ? had it turned round ? " the newly expanded search area encompasses a larger portion of the @entity64 between @entity65 and @entity66 , according to @entity67 , director general of the @entity68			1
@entity69 described the search as " extremely painstaking work , " suggesting a grid would have been drawn over the ocean and that teams are combing the area , bit by bit			1
" let 's not be fooled into thinking this is n't a vast swath of water			0
that area between @entity65 and @entity66 is still several hundred miles			0
that 's an enormous amount of water , " he said			0
although the work is challenging , @entity69 is confident @entity3 will be found			1
" it 's not hopeless by any means			0
they will find it. , " he said			0
they have to know what happened			0
" mystery passengers @entity97 'd ' still a mystery ' @entity8 , of the @entity9 , speaks from experience			0
he helped lead the search for the recorders of @entity102 , which crashed into the @entity103 in 2009			0
the @entity105 flight was en route from @entity107 to @entity108 when communications ended suddenly from the @entity110 , another state - of - the - art aircraft			0
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of flight 447 's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean			0
it took even longer to find the cause of the disaster			0
in 2011 , the aircraft 's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles			2
" in this case , i thought for sure -- in a highly - trafficked area where there 's lots of air traffic , lots of ship traffic , not far from shore -- that for sure this would be a more rapid finding of some remnants of the plane -- but nothing , " @entity8 told @entity0 's @entity6 , comparing the @entity131 and @entity105 flights			1
@entity147 of the @entity149 @entity148 similarly spoke to @entity6 on monday			0
" we are looking over a -- now -- a very large search area in the @entity64 , and then yesterday , an area northwest of the @entity153			1
but as the hours go by , that area keeps getting bigger and bigger when you account for currents and the wind , " he said , while aboard the @entity155 , which is assisting in the search			2
marks continued : " it 's a very large search area , but still a mystery -- still a lot of question marks			1
" @entity0 's @entity167 contributed to this report .			2
