for too long , religious extremism has prevailed at the expense of our common human ties			0

this pope can help transcend the culture wars of the past			0

as governor of a state that is home to many @entity138 as well as a diverse group of believers and nonbelievers , these are the values shared in many corners of @entity34 , where we recently celebrated the 350th anniversary of our founding charter -- the first among the @entity35 colonies to protect religious liberty			1
