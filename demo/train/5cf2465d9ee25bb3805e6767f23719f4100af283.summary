call it a pre-emptive strike			0
hours ahead of her appearance wednesday before a @entity4 subcommittee certain to grill her on the botched launch of the @entity7 website , health secretary @entity2 announced an internal review of what happened and why			1
then her department released the latest enrollment figures for president @entity14 's signature health care reforms , showing a big increase in november after the site 's problem - plagued rollout on october 1			1
@entity7 sign - ups hit 365,000 ; still a long way to go the moves appeared timed to blunt criticism by the @entity23 - led @entity22 of the reforms known as @entity7 and @entity2 , the cabinet secretary in charge of implementing them			1
a chorus of @entity23 critics have called for her to be fired over the failure of the website , and she sparred with several republicans at wednesday 's hearing over complaints about @entity36 and the overall reforms			1
while little new information emerged , @entity2 told the panel the government has contracted to pay $ 677 million for the @entity7 website and actually paid $ 319 million of that total so far			1
website gets $ 47 million price hike let 's have a look in a blog post wednesday , @entity2 said that @entity48 , the inspector general for the @entity49 , would review what happened with the " flawed and simply unacceptable " launch of the @entity36 website			1
" i believe strongly in the need for accountability , and in the importance of being good stewards of taxpayer dollars , " she said , adding that " we need a thorough review of the contractor performance and program management structure that resulted in the flawed launch of the website			0
" in particular , @entity72 will " review the acquisition process , overall program management , and contractor performance and payment issues related to the development and management " of the website , her blog post said			0
" we will take action to address the inspector general 's findings , " she added			0
in addition to that review , @entity2 also said a new position would be created in the @entity79 that implements @entity7 to minimize risks from major policy initiatives			1
a third step called for better training for @entity79 employees on " best practices " for hiring and working with contractors			0
a few days earlier than planned , the @entity14 administration announced wednesday that nearly 365,000 people signed up for health coverage under new exchanges created by @entity7 in the first two months of enrollment			1
the figure was a big increase over the 106,000 who signed up the first month , when the computer problems undermined enrollment , but still well below the needed pace to reach the target of 7 million by a march 31 deadline to get coverage for 2014			2
at wednesday 's hearing , @entity23 challenged the new figures by pointing out they did n't reflect people who had actually paid for new policies under @entity7			1
in a particularly combative exchange , @entity23 rep. @entity105 of @entity106 called the new enrollment figure " fraudulent because it 's not those who have purchased plans yet			1
" @entity2 shot back that health insurance under @entity7 remained private policies , requiring people to pay up before they get a card from the insurance company proving they were covered			1
that did n't satisfy @entity105 , who cut her off by saying " you 're telling us those who shopped are enrolled			0
" administration officials say traffic has increased even more since they completed upgrades to the website at the end of last month			2
through november , just over 137,200 @entity124 obtained an insurance policy through @entity36 and nearly 227,500 through the 14 state - run exchanges , according to the new federal figures			2
an additional 1.94 million people have started the process but had yet to pick a policy			2
consumers must purchase health insurance by december 23 and pay the first premium by the end of the year for coverage to begin january 1			0
sign - ups vary widely by state			0
more than 107,000 @entity138 have picked plans , compared to only 44 @entity140			0
@entity141 leads the way in the federal exchange , with nearly 18,000 people picking plans , while @entity146 has only 265 enrollees			0
@entity23 attacks led by conservative @entity23 , critics continue to attack @entity7 as an example of big government run amok , and wednesday 's hearing included fresh salvos aimed at @entity2 and @entity14			1
while some @entity23 legislators focused on specific provisions or problems with the reforms , others made clear their unhappiness dated back to the passage of the @entity7 in 2010 with no @entity23 support			1
" a lot of this is about the way it was passed , " said rep. @entity162 of @entity163 , noting that the @entity165 @entity4 leadership at the time permitted no amendments			0
" there are very deep feelings about this still			0
" rep. @entity174 of @entity175 , the chairman of the subcommittee , said misinformation by the administration about the health care reforms had eroded public trust			0
" every major promise the administration made about the @entity7 , from being able to keep your health plan if you like it , to being able to keep your doctor if you want to , the very premise of health reform in the first place , that the @entity7 would make health coverage more affordable , has proven to be wrong , " @entity174 said			1
" my constituents have repeatedly expressed to me that they feel they were lied to by the administration about the real effects of this law			0
" @entity165 lampooned the @entity23 criticism as overheated rhetoric , with rep. @entity196 of @entity197 saying that " sometimes i think they 're living on @entity199 rather than here on @entity201			2
" " it just boggles my mind to hear these @entity23 comments about a world turned upside down when @entity7 is working , " he said			1
the blog post by @entity2 amounted to a sneak preview of her remarks to the committee , emphasizing steps she was taking to find out what happened with the rollout and prevent future problems			2
some @entity23 were concerned about problems with the " back - end " operations of the @entity36 website , such as transmitting correct enrollment information to insurance companies			1
@entity2 said such issues were being addressed , including efforts to contact people who enrolled online to make sure they follow up with the company they chose to confirm their policies and pay for them			2
your @entity7 form might have errors she was unable to provide details of how many of the more than 360,000 enrollees so far had paid , adding that they would likely wait until the year - end deadline			2
" i think most @entity124 will not pay until the money is actually owed , " she said			0
