@entity0 -- tens of thousands of people took to the streets saturday in @entity0 , braving bitterly cold weather to demand fair elections after what they claim were rigged results earlier this month that returned @entity11 's party to power			1
the protest , organized primarily through social media and word of mouth , comes on the heels of an announcement by president @entity18 of sweeping political reforms , an effort to address discontent following the december 4 parliamentary elections			1
the latest mass protest follows one earlier this month , when tens of thousands of people across @entity25 turned out to protest the election results that kept @entity11 's ruling @entity10 in power , albeit with a smaller majority			1
police estimated crowds in @entity0 at 25,000 , while organizers said at least twice as many participated			1
the protests were considered -- among analysts and political observers -- the largest in @entity25 in the past two decades			0
turnout at saturday 's protests was even greater , organizers said			2

@entity18 also called for lifting many of the political restrictions imposed in the past several years by his predecessor , @entity11 , @entity25 's current prime minister and a candidate in the march 2012 presidential elections			2
he also announced a number of new anti-corruption measures and called for the redistribution of power and financial resources from the federal government to local governments across the country			0
at the same time , he rejected widespread public criticism of the parliamentary elections , which critics say were marred by fraud and other irregularities , and blamed anti-kremlin opposition figures for their " attempts to manipulate the people and foment social discord			2
