@entity3 on what was supposed to be the last day before summer recess , dysfunction reigned in @entity5			1
@entity8 @entity7 leaders called off a vote thursday on their $ 659 million emergency response to the border influx from @entity13 overwhelming immigration resources , unable to agree among themselves about what to do			1
that sparked a revolt in their caucus over doing nothing , which forced @entity7 leaders to delay the start of august break to discuss the matter further on friday morning			1
and in the @entity27 , a $ 2.7 billion @entity25 plan to respond to the immigrant surge failed in a procedural vote			1
caucus revolt asked what happens now , speaker @entity30 said he 'd be working with his caucus			0
asked if that would go into the night , he responded : " oh yeah			0
" the @entity27 measure fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance after @entity36 opposed the measure because it did n't include any policy changes to make it easier to deport children back to @entity13			1
two moderate @entity41 voted with republicans to block the bill			0
the end result ? politicians eventually go home for five weeks to campaign for the november congressional elections without sending president @entity49 legislation to address what both parties agree is a humanitarian crisis at the southern border			1
volatile issue such inability to compromise , let alone even pass any kind of legislation , showed the volatility of the immigration issue in @entity13 just over three months before the november elections			0
@entity49 asked for $ 3.7 billion in emergency funding to strengthen border security and speed up the processing of the tens of thousands of arrivals -- many unaccompanied minors -- from @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 in the past 10 months			2
@entity8 @entity36 slashed that figure and added changes to a 2008 anti-trafficking law that would remove the guarantee of an immigration hearing for children arriving on their own from @entity13			1
facing @entity25 opposition , @entity7 leaders needed almost all of their majority caucus to support the bill			0
however , many @entity36 -- mostly conservatives -- argued against approving any new money and argued the measure failed to effectively limit @entity49 from acting on his own to allow illegal immigrants to stay in the country			1
@entity49 criticism they contend he has failed to enforce immigration laws by halting deportations of some child immigrants who arrived years earlier			2
and they now expect further unilateral steps signaled by the @entity8 that would allow more undocumented immigrants to work in the @entity92			2
after a partisan debate on the measure , an expected vote suddenly got canceled			0
a subsequent 90 - minute @entity7 caucus meeting behind closed doors resulted in the decision to keep going on friday to get something passed , participants said			2
" i was prepared to be very critical of the decision to go home but thankfully the leadership is doing the right thing and saying we 're going to get this thing through , " said rep. @entity101 of @entity102 , while rep. @entity103 of @entity104 described it as " an emotional ' we 've got to do something ' kind of cheerleading event			0
" several @entity36 told @entity4 that @entity7 leaders made it clear they wo n't hold a vote on the border bill until they knew it had enough support t pass , even it that took beyond friday			1
embarrassing result it was an embarrassing result for @entity30 and his new leadership team put together after former majority leader @entity126 's primary defeat last month , displaying the continuing deep divisions between conservative and more moderate @entity128 that has caused similar episodes in the past on other spending matters			0
" this situation shows the intense concern within our conference -- and among the @entity92 people -- about the need to ensure the security of our borders and the president 's refusal to faithfully execute our laws , " the @entity8 @entity7 leadership said in a statement			2
in one of the political ironies of @entity3 , the @entity7 leaders called for @entity49 to take steps on his own to address the border issue without congressional approval , a day after voting to sue him for doing exactly that			2
" there are numerous steps the president can and should be taking right now , without the need for congressional action , to secure our borders and ensure these children are returned swiftly and safely to their countries , " the statement said			0
shortly after , @entity8 senior adviser @entity160 tweeted : " by pulling their own bill , the @entity8 @entity7 once again proves why the president must act on his own to solve problems			1
" unilateral action @entity8 spokesman @entity165 said @entity49 will do what he can to address immigration reform because @entity8 @entity36 have refused to vote on a comprehensive measure passed last year by the @entity27			1
" the president ca n't do as much as @entity5 could do in terms of addressing some of these problems , but we 're gon na figure out what exactly the law will allow the president to do and we 're going to do as much as possible within the confines of the law to address a problem whose solution @entity36 in @entity5 continue to actively block , " @entity165 said			1
he told reporters the @entity49 administration already shifted resources from the nation 's interior to the border to try to speed up the processing of new arrivals			2
" we have surged some technology to allow immigration judges and other @entity192 ( @entity192 ) prosecutors and asylum officials the opportunity to try to whittle down the bottleneck or the backlog of immigration cases that currently exists , " @entity165 said			0
" we 've prioritized the cases of recent border crossers to try to process those cases more efficiently			0
" @entity27 challenges republicans led by conservative sen. @entity202 of @entity203 say @entity49 plans to unilaterally issue work permits to as many as 6 million immigrants living illegally in the @entity92 , which the critics call a violation of the @entity208			1
sessions tried to get an amendment that would block such presidential action added to the @entity27 border legislation , but @entity41 defeated his motion			1
however , @entity41 were unable later to secure the 60 votes necessary to overcome a budget challenge against the measure , which included $ 2.7 billion in immigration funding along with $ 900 million to fight @entity92 wildfires and bolster @entity221 's @entity220 missile defense system			0
sessions raised the budget challenge , noting the total $ 3.6 billion cost of the proposal would all be borrowed			0
@entity4 's @entity225 contributed to this report .			0
