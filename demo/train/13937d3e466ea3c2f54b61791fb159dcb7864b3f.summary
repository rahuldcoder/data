-- @entity1 ca n't reach his hotel in @entity3 because there 's a police barricade in front of it			1
a manager promises to " help " him cancel the reservation , but three days later , his credit card is charged $ 113			1
now his credit card has sided with the hotel			1
is there anything else he can do ? q : i do n't know where else to turn			0
i recently booked a room at the @entity19 in @entity3 through its central reservations phone number			2
when i arrived , the @entity21 had the entire block closed off			0
i immediately called the hotel and told a manager i could n't access the hotel			2
he said he did not know when the blockade would be lifted and could n't help get my car or luggage to the hotel			0
he could n't cancel my reservation because i had made it through @entity34 's central reservations number			1
after several more attempts to reach the hotel , he agreed to help me cancel my reservation			1
i stayed at another hotel that night			0
three days later , a $ 113 charge appeared on my credit card from the @entity34			1
i disputed the charge , but they told me i could n't get a refund because i could not prove that they refused me the room			0
when i called guest relations they said they needed a cancellation number before they would consider a refund			0
otherwise the hotel itself would need to reverse the charge			0
when i call the hotel , i get only voicemail			0
can you help ? -- @entity1 , @entity57 , @entity58 a : if a hotel representative says your reservation is canceled , you should n't be charged for your stay			1
but a review of your correspondence raises a few red flags			0
first , a manager told you that it was impossible for him to cancel a reservation made through @entity34 's 800 - number			1
then , a few minutes later , the same manager agrees to " help " you cancel the reservation			1
i would assume that " helping " you means your reservation is officially canceled , but what if he just looked into it and then decided it could n't be done , and left your original reservation intact ? since @entity34 did n't have a cancellation number , it probably means there was no cancellation			1
here 's what you did right : you noted the name of the manager with whom you spoke			2
you followed up with @entity34 , and you were persistent but polite			2
here 's what you overlooked : you should have called the central reservations number and asked for a cancellation number			0
if they refused to give you a number , you should have given a representative the name of the manager you spoke with			0
i would have followed up with the manager and not let @entity34 off the hook until you had a number			1
but getting a number is n't enough			0
instead of continuing to call @entity34 , i would have sent it a short , cordial email asking for a verification of your cancellation in writing			2
if you send an email through a hotel company 's web site ( @entity34 ) you 'll typically receive a meaningful answer in a matter of days , if not hours			1
with that information , your credit card dispute would have probably been a slam - dunk			1
before getting to the resolution on your case , let me add one more thing			0
as far as i can tell , @entity34 was under no obligation to refund your money			2
you could n't reach the hotel because of a police barricade , which the property could n't control			1
but since a manager assured you that he would help you make a cancellation , i think it 's reasonable to expect a refund			2
i contacted @entity34 on your behalf			2
it reviewed your case and apologized for the way in which your refund was handled			0
" clearly the inability to access the hotel was beyond your control , and in as such , you should be relieved of the $ 113 charge you have received , " a representative wrote to you in a letter			1
you 're getting your $ 113 back			1
