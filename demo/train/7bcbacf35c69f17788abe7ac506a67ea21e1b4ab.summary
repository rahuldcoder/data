-- @entity1 ended his 2011 @entity3 commitments wearing a @entity5 outfit and the robes of a @entity7 , and the @entity9 driver hopes next year will bring a return of the old @entity12 spirit			1
the legendary @entity14 marque has won 31 world titles overall , but none since clinching a 16th constructors ' crown in 2008			0
@entity1 was fourth in the drivers ' standings this year , 135 points behind @entity23 's all - conquering @entity22 after winning just one race , while teammate @entity25 was a massive 274 points off the pace in sixth			1
after being @entity28 for @entity12 employees at the team 's @entity31 headquarters , and then one of the @entity7 at a sponsors ' party , @entity1 turned his attentions towards his bid to add a third world title to his 2005 and 2006 successes at @entity40			1
@entity42 's new @entity3 project " this is the time when one is always optimistic , but then we must wait for the start of the season to see where we really are			0
it 's true that in the past few days , there was a good feeling at @entity31 and there 's an air of confidence about it , " the 30 - year - old told @entity12 's website			2
" we want to reacquaint ourselves with the taste of winning that has eluded us for a while			0
last spring , we made important changes to the structure of the technical part of the team and now we have adopted a new approach , a less conservative one , in the design of the new car			2
" the philosophy behind the 2012 car is very different to that of 2011 , especially in some key areas like suspension and aerodynamics			2
" @entity1 , who joined @entity12 in 2010 , is now looking forward to unwinding before testing begins again in @entity75 in february ahead of the opening race in @entity77 on march 18			1
" now 's the time to take it easy for a few weeks , time to recharge the batteries and be 100 % ready for next season , which i expect will be much more of an equal fight than the one just gone , " he said			0
" @entity23 will still be very strong , but i think they will have less room for improvement than us , as we were so far behind this year			0

@entity1 confident that @entity12 can return to winning ways in 2012
@entity9 driver and teammate @entity25 finished fourth and sixth this year
@entity1 says the design of the team 's new race car will be less conservative
