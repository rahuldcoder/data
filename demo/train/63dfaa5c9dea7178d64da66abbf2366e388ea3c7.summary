@entity0 -- the following is the prepared transcript of @entity6 speaker @entity5 's speech monday night on debt reduction talks : good evening			1
i serve as speaker of the whole @entity6 -- of the members of both parties that you elect			1
these are difficult times in the life of our nation			0
millions are looking for work , have been for some time , and the spending binge going on in @entity0 is a big part of the reason why			1
before i served in @entity22 , i ran a small business in @entity24			0
i was amazed at how different @entity0 operated than every business in @entity26			1
where most @entity26 business make the hard choices to pay their bills and live within their means , in @entity0 more spending and more debt is business as usual			1
i 've got news for @entity0 -- those days are over			1
president @entity36 came to @entity22 in january and requested business as usual -- yet another routine increase in the national debt limit -- we in the @entity6 said " not so fast			1
" here was the president , asking for the largest debt increase in @entity26 history , on the heels of the largest spending binge in @entity26 history			1
@entity36 's speech : compromise needed now here 's what we got for that spending binge : a massive health care bill that most @entity26 never asked for			1
a " stimulus " bill that was more effective in producing material for late - night comedians than it was in producing jobs			2
and a national debt that has gotten so out of hand it has sparked a crisis without precedent in my lifetime or yours			0
the @entity26 can not default on its debt obligations			0
the jobs and savings of too many @entity26 are at stake			0
what we told the president in january was this : the @entity26 people will not accept an increase in the debt limit without significant spending cuts and reforms			1
and over the last six months , we 've done our best to convince the president to partner with us to do something dramatic to change the fiscal trajectory of our country			2
something that will boost confidence in our economy , renew a measure of faith in our government , and help small businesses get back on track			0
last week , the @entity6 passed such a plan , and with bipartisan support			1
it 's called the " @entity93			2
it cuts and @entity95 government spending and paves the way for a @entity97 to the @entity98 , which we believe is the best way to stop @entity0 from spending money it does n't have			1
before we even passed the bill in the @entity6 , the president said he would veto it			1
i want you to know i made a sincere effort to work with the president to identify a path forward that would implement the principles of @entity110 in a manner that could secure bipartisan support and be signed into law			2
i gave it my all			0
unfortunately , the president would not take yes for an answer			2
even when we thought we might be close on an agreement , the president 's demands changed			2
the president has often said we need a " balanced " approach -- which in @entity0 means : we spend more			1
having run a small business , i know those tax increases will destroy jobs			0
the president is adamant that we can not make fundamental changes to our entitlement programs			2
as the father of two daughters , i know these programs wo n't be there for them and their kids unless significant action is taken now			2
the sad truth is that the president wanted a blank check six months ago , and he wants a blank check today			2
that is just not going to happen			0
you see , there is no stalemate in @entity22			0
the @entity6 has passed a bill to raise the debt limit with bipartisan support			1
and this week , while the @entity145 is struggling to pass a bill filled with phony accounting and @entity0 gimmicks , we will pass another bill -- one that was developed with the support of the bipartisan leadership of the @entity145			1
obviously , i expect that bill can and will pass the @entity145 , and be sent to the president for his signature			1
if the president signs it , the ' crisis ' atmosphere he has created will simply disappear			2
the debt limit will be raised			0
spending will be cut by more than one trillion dollars , and a serious , bipartisan committee of the @entity22 will begin the hard but necessary work of dealing with the tough challenges our nation faces			0
the individuals doing this work will not be outsiders , but elected representatives of the people , doing the job they were elected to do as outlined in the @entity98			0
those decisions should be made based on how they will affect people who are struggling to get a job , not how they affect some politician 's chances of getting re-elected			0
this debate is n't about president @entity36 and @entity6 republicans ... it is n't about @entity22 and the @entity6 ... it 's about what 's standing between the @entity26 people and the future we seek for ourselves and our families			1
you know , i 've always believed , the bigger government , the smaller the people			0
and right now , we have a government so big and so expensive it 's sapping the drive of our people and keeping our economy from running at full capacity			0
the solution to this crisis is not complicated : if you 're spending more money than you 're taking in , you need to spend less of it			0
there is no symptom of big government more menacing than our debt			0
break its grip , and we begin to liberate our economy and our future			0
we are up to the task , and i hope president @entity36 will join us in this work			1
@entity213 bless you and your families , and @entity216 .			0
