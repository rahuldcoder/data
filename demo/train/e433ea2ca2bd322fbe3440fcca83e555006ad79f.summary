-- for many people the financial sector appears to be a sprawling , interconnected mass of colossal banks , complex jargon and mind - boggling numbers			1
as a result , a question like " how do we improve the financial system ? " often seems very abstract			1
we can propose particular policies -- such as limiting bankers ' bonuses -- but these do not fundamentally change how people experience the system			1
entrepreneurs , likewise , push particular innovations that they think will improve finance , but they normally focus on some limited shorter - term goal , like reducing fees in the payments system			1
it is not a vision that can rally people together			2
what we need is a vision that provides us with simple , broad guideposts of where we want to eventually get to			2
i would personally like to see a financial system more like @entity32			1
the key characteristics of @entity32 @entity32 has five key characteristics			1
firstly , everyone has the opportunity to participate in producing it			2
you can set up an account and begin editing			2
secondly , provided you have the @entity40 , you have access to using it			1
thirdly , it is transparent			2
if edits are made , people can check them and hold the editors to account			2
you can debate what should be included in articles , and request amendments			2
the fourth characteristic is the community ethos that has developed around it			1
participants may bicker with each other , but on balance they feel they are working towards a larger goal of building the site and its integrity			2
the final key characteristic is that you have access to the underlying software , so if you do not think @entity32 is working , or have different requirements , you can implement your own version of it			1
for example , check out @entity65 or @entity66			2
we are quite a way from achieving a financial system that embeds these characteristics , but let 's look at initiatives that are aiming towards changing that			1
goal 1 : wider participation in financial production right now , production of financial services is limited to a closed , elite group of professionals -- bankers , fund managers , traders , and so on -- who reap very large rewards			1
they might possess talent , but they are also known to not always act in the public interest , and to occasionally cause giant economic crashes			0
encouraging wider participation in financial production would create more diversity in the system whilst empowering people			1
this is why peer - to - peer finance systems are a welcome innovation			0
they enable people to take control of a portion on their savings and lend or invest it directly into ventures that they feel personally attracted to			0
one of my favorites is @entity108 , which allows people to invest directly in wind farms			0
it gives an active role to someone who might otherwise passively deposit savings in unaccountable , non-transparent banks			0
other sites like @entity116 enable peer - to - peer microlending in developing countries			0
goal 2 : wider access to financial services the current financial system tends to steer money to those who already have it			1
for example , huge amounts of money get lent to hedge funds , while entrepreneurs with small businesses that are useful to society , but that are not sexy like @entity133 , get ignored by big investors and banks			0
one welcome trend that is challenging this is the rise of crowdfunding , which opens up financing opportunities to all sorts of underdogs			1
this includes filmmakers , young businesspeople who have heart but little track record , and projects that are too small for big banks to care about			0
for example , @entity150 is used to raise money social enterprises like @entity154			0
there are some great niche crowdfunding platforms too , such as the @entity158 - based @entity157 which caters for journalists			0
goal 3 : increased transparency the financial sector is notoriously opaque			1
have you ever tried to find out what your bank invests in ? it is often almost impossible			0
in the @entity169 , banks like @entity168 have taken the lead on trying to be transparent and accountable			0
such institutions represent a tiny percentage of overall banks , but set a great example			0
initiatives like @entity178 - based @entity177 work from the borrower side , casting light on the money behind large oil companies			0
goal 4 : building a collaborative culture the prevailing culture of finance is split into two toxic camps			0
on the one hand there are passive retail investors who put money into banks and pension funds but who do not expect much in the way of accountability			0
on the other hand , there is the high - flying world of glory - boy traders and corporate financiers who care little about financial inclusion			1
people do not always want to have to take full responsibility for their finances , but it would be great to encourage more collaborative , creative participation in financial life			1
that is why it is fantastic to see the rise of do - it - yourself corporate finance initiatives like @entity216 's equity for punks , where individual beer lovers get to participate in an enterprise they are passionate about , without having to pay @entity222 fees			0
check out @entity223 shares too			0
goal 5 : preserving the right to dissent no financial system is ever going to be perfect , and any particular model inevitably comes with tradeoffs			1
for example , deposit insurance was initially put in place to protect small - scale depositors , but it has subsequently contributed to people 's complacency towards banks			0
our goal should not be to try design a stable utopia , but to preserve peoples ' ability to challenge or dissent from whatever dominant system is in place at any one time			2
to allow this to happen though , we need to improve financial education			2
the current banking sector is unaccountable for many reasons , but one of them is simply the poor state of financial literacy , leaving empowered financiers facing off against people who frequently feel alienated or unsure about how the system works			1
finance is a social art , not a closed science			0
nobody should ever be mislead into thinking that they do not have right or ability to make a stand			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			1

the financial system should take cues from @entity32 , says former broker @entity266
the system should focus on transparency , access and community
@entity277 opens up financing opportunities to the underdogs , he says
