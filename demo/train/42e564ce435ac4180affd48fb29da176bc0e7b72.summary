@entity21 describes a forcible cell extraction as the @entity6 base 's process in which detainees who do not wish to be force - fed are restrained , sometimes " violently , " and taken to a force - feeding chair			1
the forced feedings are the @entity10 government 's response to hunger strikes by detainees			1
@entity13 , in court filings , seeks an injunction against " abusive " and painful force - feedings			0
@entity40 attorneys argued in court papers that although @entity13 was subject to forced feedings between march 2013 and february 2014 , " the medical records during that time period are not material to his current motion for preliminary injunction , which seeks prospective injunctive relief to stop ( forced ) feeding going forward			1
