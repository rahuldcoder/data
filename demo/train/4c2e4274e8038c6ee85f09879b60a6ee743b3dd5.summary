@entity0 , @entity1 -- all around the world this weekend , @entity3 are celebrating @entity5			1
for them , this holiest of days announces that death does not have the final word and that eternal life awaits those who would just believe			1
sunday also marks the anniversary of the rev. @entity13 's death			1
forty - two years ago , an assassin 's bullet took his life as he struggled to secure the promises of @entity19 democracy for the children of slaves			2
his sacrifice , along with countless others , helped usher in a new chapter in @entity19 life -- one that prepared the way for the election of our nation 's first @entity30 - @entity19 president			2
every now and again , the convergence of significant historical moments occasions a time for serious reflection			0
how might we think about the significance of the resurrection of @entity39 and the martyrdom of @entity13 to the lives we currently live as @entity19 ? what lessons does @entity5 hold for us ? and what does remembering @entity13 's death teach us ? on april 27 , 1957 , dr. @entity13 delivered an @entity5 sermon titled , " questions that @entity47			1
" for him , @entity5 settled the mystery of death and secured for us the importance of living a life in light of those forces that go beyond our physical experience			1
we are not simply biological processes			0
instead , @entity13 argued , @entity5 cries out to us about the importance of the unseen and of the personality , those " spiritual forces that are eternal and not merely these material things that we look about and see			1
our hopes and aspirations , our joys and triumphs matter			0
not because of something we have actually done , but rather , because of an inheritance borne on a cross on @entity68			0
@entity13 understood @entity5 's answer to the significance of human action in the world			1
" there is a faith , there is love , there is hope , there is something beyond the external that will stand through the ages			2
" this view holds off the notion that life has no meaning or is doomed to end in shipwreck			0
the fact that so many have lost their jobs , their homes , their dreams in these difficult times confirms for us that life carries with it a ' good friday ' experience -- that darkness and disappointment can be constant companions			0
" but thank @entity100 the crucifixion was not the last act in that great and powerful drama , " @entity13 preached			1
" there is another act			0
and it is something that we sing out and cry and ring out today			0
thank @entity100 a day came when @entity107 had to pass			0
" for @entity13 , @entity5 teaches us that death does not have the last word ; that invisible forces are more real than the shadows that we currently inhabit ; and that the darkness of @entity107 may be necessary but will eventually pass away			1
@entity5 ultimately demonstrates that " love is the most powerful force in the universe , " said @entity13			1
and this insight reaches beyond @entity3 to all of us , no matter what we believe			0
here , love is n't some sentimental notion ; instead , it involves risks , daring and growth -- a surrender to that feature of human personality that can cause us to sacrifice our lives in defense of it			2
it shatters hubris and crushes the illusions of death			0
it fortifies the soul amid the darkness of the hour ; it calls us to bear witness and to suffer , if necessary , the consequences			0
the mindless chatter of today distracts us from the power of love			1
instead , we are mired in the sundry politics of @entity144 , or we are content to spew venom at our opponents			0
mean - spiritedness carries the day			0
but @entity5 , if i understand @entity13 correctly , teaches us to love and to witness the miracle of the resurrection before the powers that be , no matter the consequences			1
" it says to us , " @entity13 preached , " that love is the most durable power in the world " and is stronger " than all of the military giants , all of the nations that base their way on military power			1
" such a conviction led him on april 4 , 1967 , a year before he was killed , to condemn the @entity163 and to say that @entity19 was " the greatest purveyor of violence in the world			1
" the fact that @entity5 falls this year on the anniversary of dr. @entity13 's death highlights the true lesson of this holiest of days			1
we are not to sit idly by because @entity5 proclaims the victory			2
too many @entity3 take comfort in the wrong - headed idea that all is settled because @entity39 rose from the dead			0
@entity13 , @entity175 's death suggests otherwise			1
his was a life given in love and in devotion to justice			2
are we , @entity3 or not , as committed ? to stopping war ? to ending poverty ? to fighting for the most vulnerable among us ? or , are we content to rest in the illusion that salvation is guaranteed ? our lives , if we are to be saved , must stand as a testament to that legacy which , beyond our doing , is inescapable			0
cowardice and complicity must die in us			0
and we must rise again to " love " a new world into existence			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			2
