despite a highly - publicized anti-corruption drive spearheaded by president @entity1 , @entity3 's position on an international corruption perceptions index has deteriorated in the past 12 months			1
@entity6 's @entity5 2014 ranks countries based on a 100 - point " corruption perception " scale , where zero equals a " highly corrupt " perception and 100 means the country is perceived to be very clean			1
in the report , released wednesday , @entity3 scored 36 , falling to 100th place from 80th last year , putting it on a par with @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity18 and @entity19 rank equal - worst of 174 countries with a score of just eight			1
@entity22 and @entity23 ranked least corrupt , with scores of 92 and 91 , respectively			1
the @entity5 highlights the problems that emerging economies have with public sector corruption , misappropriation of funds and bribery , said @entity31 , the chair of @entity6 , in a press release			1
it 's based on perceptions of public sector corruption , from the perspective of business people and country experts			1
" the @entity6 report is inconsistent with @entity3 's well - known achievements in the anticorruption campaign , " @entity3 @entity40 spokesperson @entity39 told @entity41			1
" the public will judge the achievement that the government has obtained and it will not be affected by the index			2
" corruption is the disease of human society which harms the justice and development of the entire society			2
it has to be eliminated			0
" anti-corruption drive @entity1 's much - vaunted drive against the " tigers " -- high - ranking public officials -- and " flies " -- lowly apparatchiks -- has been touted as a " life or death " priority for the leader , who announced the initiative shortly after taking office in 2012			1
since then , @entity3 state media says 75,000 cadres have been found in breach of austerity measures , as of the end of august			1
recently , the anti-corruption drive was extended to @entity3 's military , with particular emphasis on projects and medical and weapons procurement , @entity74 reported			1
in the past , @entity1 has said that corruption could lead to " the collapse of the party and the downfall of the state			2
" despite his warnings , and attempts to address the issue , the report finds that perceptions of public sector corruption in @entity3 are worsening			1
@entity91 , @entity92 for the @entity93 , @entity6 , says that @entity95 's approach is misguided			1
" @entity3 's fight against corruption focuses on prosecution , a very top - down way of fighting corruption , " he told @entity41			1
" the whole campaign of catching ' tigers ' and ' flies , ' and from this summer the ' foxhunt ' ( the worldwide operation to track down fugitive officials ) they all talk about prosecution , punishing people			0
" in many other parts of the world it is a more holistic approach , you need to talk about prevention as well			0
so , irrespective of the fact that @entity3 is trying to punish corrupt officials , it is still thrives			1
so this is a very strong message to @entity3			1
" @entity3 's drop from 40 points to 36 from in the index was one of the " biggest falls " of 2014 , @entity118 said			1
other countries whose rankings dropped were @entity127 , which dropped five points , and @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 , which all dropped four			2
economic growth suffers @entity6 says the extent of corruption within countries has an impact on their own economic growth , and there 's a risk of problems being exported with trade and investment			1
" the 2014 @entity5 shows that economic growth is undermined and efforts to stop corruption fade when leaders and high level officials abuse power to appropriate public funds for personal gain , " @entity31 said in a statement			1
" corrupt officials smuggle ill - gotten assets into safe havens through offshore companies with absolute impunity			2
" countries at the bottom need to adopt radical anti-corruption measures in favor of their people			0
countries at the top of the index should make sure they do n't export corrupt practices to underdeveloped countries , " @entity31 added			2
