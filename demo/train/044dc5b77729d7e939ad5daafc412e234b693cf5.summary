-- the @entity1 can not account for about $ 2 billion it was given to cover @entity4 - related expenses and is not providing @entity4 with a complete list of @entity7 - funded reconstruction projects , according to two new government audits			1
the reports come from the office of the @entity11			0
the @entity4 government in 2004 gave the @entity1 access to about $ 3 billion to pay bills for certain contracts , and the department can only show what happened to about a third of that , the inspector general says in an audit published friday			1
although the @entity1 ( @entity1 ) had " internal processes and controls " to track payments , the " bulk of the records are missing , " the report says , adding that the department is searching for them			1
other documents are missing as well , including monthly reports documenting expenses , the audit says			0
" from july 2004 through december 2007 , @entity1 should have provided 42 monthly reports			0
however , it can locate only the first four reports			0
" a letter accompanying the report is signed by @entity38 , the inspector general			0
the audit was overseen by @entity40 , assistant inspector general for audits			0
in a response letter also contained in the report , defense under secretary @entity42 acknowledges " a records management issue			1
" the audit says it believes records management is to blame , and " has been an ongoing problem for @entity1 in @entity4			1
by all accounts , @entity1 established good internal processes and controls to account for and report on " the funds it was given after the @entity53 dissolved			2
where the records did exist , they matched other records and contained " good financial documentation supporting individual payments			0
" also , there is " sufficient evidence " that required monthly reports were sent to the government of @entity4 , even though they ca n't be found , the audit said			1
the audit deals with a time when @entity4 's government was undergoing a transition			0
the @entity53 ran the country for 14 months from 2003 to 2004			0
during that time , the authority awarded numerous contracts			0
when it dissolved in 2004 , the @entity4 government gave the @entity1 access to the $ 3 billion to pay bills for contracts the provisional authority had awarded			1
the @entity1 letter from @entity78 -- the department 's deputy chief financial officer -- thanks the inspector general 's office for " the collaborative effort and professional courtesy " in a series of audits			2
separately , the inspector general 's office sent a letter sunday to the @entity7 ambassador to @entity4 complaining that the @entity7 government is not providing @entity4 with a complete list of reconstruction projects			1
the @entity7 criteria for selecting which projects to report to @entity4 -- which include only those valued at $ 250,000 or more -- is a central part of the problem , the letter says			1
the @entity7 @entity98 says the system is designed to help @entity4 " focus its limited resources on sustainment of infrastructure and other large capital projects done through @entity7 reconstruction efforts , " the report notes			1
the inspector general 's office argues that the limited list -- which is also " hampered by unreliable data and other data entry problems " -- does not allow @entity4 to decide where to focus its resources , and notes that the country might consider some smaller projects more important than those that are reported			2
" without more comprehensive knowledge about reconstruction projects the ( @entity4 government ) will not be in a position to maximize the use of its resources , " the report says			2
billions of dollars in spending are not reported to @entity4 under the current system , the report says			2
in a response letter , @entity122 , assistant chief of mission for the @entity98 in @entity4 , says that while the current system is incomplete , " it does capture the vast majority of reconstruction projects and there is no other alternative that captures more			1
" he also notes that the @entity4 reconstruction effort " is now in its very last stages , and all remaining capital projects will be reported through the asset transfer process			0
" the @entity11 was created in 2004 to continue oversight of @entity4 reconstruction programs .			0

new : the @entity7 is keeping @entity4 out of the loop on some projects , report says
new : the @entity98 in @entity4 *disagrees* with that complaint
the @entity1 ca n't account for about $ 2 billion in past spending , report says
the department acknowledges a " records management issue "
