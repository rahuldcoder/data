-- a flat tire saw @entity3 's lead in the @entity4 cut to seven and a half minutes by @entity6 @entity5 who finished second behind stage eight winner @entity8			1
@entity3 suffered a puncture 30km from the end of the stage between @entity12 and @entity13 and saw his overall lead whittled down to seven minutes 36 seconds by @entity5			1
the @entity6 lost out to @entity15 , from @entity16 , by just five seconds and is still awaiting his first stage win in the 2012 rally			1
defending champion @entity19 , from @entity20 , was disrupted by technical problems and had to stop on several occasions			2
he now trails @entity3 by over 45 minutes			1
pole @entity23 is third , 12 seconds behind @entity5 and 7 minutes 48 secs behind the leader			1
@entity3 is a @entity26 legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes , all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to @entity31 in 2009 but he did n't enjoy his best stage on monday			1
he told the @entity4 's official website : " i am losing loads of time			2
i drove quite slowly in the rocky parts because i was scared of punctures			2
and despite this ... i had one 30 km from the finish			0
it was a bad special , but that is the way it is			0
" @entity5 started three minutes before us , and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him			2
i think that when he saw us he stepped it up , leaving us in the dust			0
" he can win this thing , so it is essential for him to manage this situation as well as he can			0
" defending motorcycle champion @entity49 sealed the 20th stage win of his @entity4 career as rival @entity52 got stuck in the mud			1
stage eight saw @entity49 , from @entity16 , snatch the lead from the @entity57 and build a lead of one minute and 26 seconds			1
@entity52 spent ten minutes trying to extricate himself from a patch of mud and cut a frustrated figure at the end of the stage			1
he said : " there was a torrent of mud between the inspection of the reconnaissance car two days ago and today			0
therefore , it did not appear in the road book and i was the first to fall into the trap			0
" there was no way i could have avoided it			0
i am awaiting the organisers ' decision : after @entity78 , @entity79 and a few others had gone through , they took a detour , otherwise there would have been 200 vehicles trapped in the mud			0
" so i fail to see why i and the others should be the only ones to pay the price			0
but i do not think we will let this be			0
