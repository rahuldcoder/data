-- a cruise can be a stress - free escape from day - to - day life , promising all - you - can - eat buffets and nightly entertainment at a reasonable price			1
but some high - profile incidents aboard ship have led to rough sailing for some cruise lines , with a new survey showing that 18 % of passengers report experiencing a problem on their trip -- and walking away unsatisfied			1
nevertheless , overall customer satisfaction with cruise lines remains high , according to the survey from @entity20			1
conducting its first report on cruise line consumer satisfaction , the global market research company wanted to see how the industry ranked in customer service relations after a series of events that captured headlines			1
among the recent bad news : the @entity30 hit a reef off the coast of @entity33 in january 2012 , killing 32 people			0
then there was february 's @entity37 cruise , which experienced an engine fire in the control room that led to a loss of electrical power for five days			2
in may , @entity43 's @entity42 caught fire , forcing the ship to cut short the trip			2
" it is important for cruise line companies to understand their strengths and weaknesses in the service they provide to their passengers , " says @entity47 , senior account manager of the global travel and hospitality practice at @entity50			1
" cruises in general are not something you get on to go from point a to point @entity62 , " @entity47 says			0

five things we 've learned about cruising @entity78 , @entity43 and @entity79 came in first , second and third , respectively , in customer satisfaction , while carnival ranked last in the report of eight cruise lines			1
the survey measured seven factors that affect a customer 's experience : service , state of the room , food , the efficiency of boarding and departing on the ship , entertainment , cost and excursions			1
" when you 're on ship for a long time , there are bound to be problems , " @entity47 says			0
" i think the biggest thing as a company is the ability to recover			0
" when @entity43 's @entity42 had a fire in may , the cruise line did n't waste time in notifying customers of its recovery plan			2
less than an hour after the fire was extinguished , company representatives tweeted details that passengers would receive a full refund of the fare paid and a certificate for future sailing			0
though cruise lines are catering to the majority of their passengers ' needs , @entity47 says the firms need to be more aware of positive and negative feedback and work on customer retention			1
customers are often voicing their opinions regarding service through social media			0
