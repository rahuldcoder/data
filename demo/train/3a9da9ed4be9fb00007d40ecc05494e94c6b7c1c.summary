it 's not the @entity2 protesters yelling " mic check " who are bugging @entity5 at his events these days			1
it 's the attack ads occupying the airwaves in @entity10			1
a new spot from the @entity13 super political action committee @entity12 starts with the simple question : " know what makes @entity16 happy ? " the answer : " @entity5 's baggage			1
" in the ad , luggage bearing the names of the former speaker 's past liabilities then spills out onto an airline baggage carousel			0
" @entity5 has more baggage than the airlines , " the ad says			1
the spot does n't mention @entity30 's personal baggage			0
but it might as well			0
@entity30 has demanded that @entity13 call on the super pac to pull its negative ads. " i object to lies			1
i object to negative smear campaigns , " @entity30 said tuesday			0
but @entity13 makes no apologies			1
" if you ca n't stand the relatively modest heat in the kitchen right now , wait until @entity16 's hell 's kitchen shows up , " @entity13 said in @entity37 on wednesday			1
unfortunately for the former speaker , it 's about to get hotter			0
the 2012 campaign is now a high stakes version of @entity46			0
in the battle of @entity13 versus @entity30 , guess who the ghost is ? the @entity12 super pac is not only run by former @entity13 political operatives			1
it also is funded in large part by big donors who still work at @entity13 's former investment firm , @entity55			1
none of this is a mystery to @entity30			0
" we need to understand that these are his people , running his ads , doing his dirty work , while he pretends to be above it , " @entity30 said tuesday			0
according to an analysis of disclosure forms from @entity12 conducted by the nonpartisan government watchdog @entity69 , the @entity66 super pac has spent $ 430,380 on ads in @entity10			1
that 's more than the $ 325,770 spent by the @entity13 campaign			1
combined , they are outspending @entity30 in @entity10 by more than seven to one			2
@entity55 employees have given $ 1.25 million to restore our future			0
contrast that to the $ 84,500 contributed by @entity55 employees directly to the @entity13 campaign			1
contributions to federal candidates are limited to $ 2,500			0
there are no limits on donations to @entity65 's			0
that 's part of what makes them super			0
in its landmark 2010 decision in the case of " @entity92 vs. the @entity93 , " the @entity89 @entity88 green - lighted the activities of super pac 's , effectively allowing them to legally raise and spend unlimited amounts of money			1
@entity98 with the @entity69 said @entity55 's connection to " @entity12 " gives @entity13 a clear advantage in the race			2
" he automatically has access to extraordinary amounts of money through these individuals who are connected to securities and investment firms , which are part of the world he used to inhabit , " @entity102 said			0
@entity13 has suggested he has no legal authority to pull the super @entity65 spots			2
" my goodness , if we coordinate in any way whatsoever , we go to the big house , " @entity13 said in an interview on @entity119 's " @entity118			2
" @entity102 said @entity13 could do more			2
" if @entity13 wanted to he could call a press conference and call on the super pac to take down the ad , " @entity102 said			2
@entity13 defended " @entity12 " by pointing to the @entity122 , @entity123 , which has already started attacking his campaign			1
that pac , run by former @entity127 deputy press secretary @entity126 , has one spot featuring a now infamous photo of @entity13 during his days at @entity55			2
the picture shows @entity13 in a suit stuffed with money			1
as @entity13 has pointed out , the president 's advisers have set their fundraising goal at $ 1 billion			2
the @entity13 campaign said its own spots are positive			1
its latest ad stars @entity13 's wife , @entity139 , who extols the virtues of good moral character			2
" if you really want to know how a person will operate , look at how they 've lived their life , " @entity142 says in the ad			0
that sounds like another subtle swipe at @entity30 , who has a new ad featuring his wife , @entity152			0
" from our family to yours , @entity157 and @entity158 , " she says in the spot			0
with super @entity65 fever spreading , a little holiday cheer does n't hurt .			0

" @entity163 " political action committees are spending millions of *dollars* on ads in @entity10
one group supporting @entity13 has been attacking @entity5
a recent @entity88 ruling allows those pacs to spend unlimited money in a campaign
