-- @entity1 has had what her mother dryly calls " a very alternative life " since birth because of her chronic health issues			1
the 24 - year - old @entity7 , @entity8 , woman has @entity11 's disease , a rare congenital disorder that obstructs the large intestine due to an absence of nerve cells that regulate muscle movement			1
she never attended public school full time , has been in and out of hospitals since she was a newborn , and discovered that the one thing she can eat without getting sick is a bag of @entity22			0
now , @entity23 needs four organs -- a liver , kidney , pancreas and small intestine -- from a deceased type o donor to live			1
" it 's a pretty unusual circumstance , " said dr. @entity30 , chief of transplantation at the @entity32 , where @entity23 is being treated			1
" fortunately , she 's young , and youth trumps everything			0
she 's in very good shape relative to her condition			0
" at birth , @entity23 was one of only three people in the world with her particular type of disease , and doctors predicted she would n't live beyond her first year			1
growing up , " i would go to school when i could , but i did n't know anybody and always felt left out , " @entity23 said			1
" most of the time i felt ok , but i was really in a fragile state			0
i just wanted to be a normal kid			2
" why i donated my bone marrow @entity23 managed her disease as well as possible but experienced a major setback at 12 when she was given a drug too powerful for someone of her size			1
it destroyed her small intestine and her kidney , forcing her onto a liquid diet			0
it was n't until she was 17 that she received a small intestine transplant , and at 18 she accepted one of her mother 's kidneys			2
then , in 2011 , a negative reaction to a blood transfusion caused widespread intestinal failure			1
doctors removed both transplants last fall and advised her that they would have to remove her pancreas and her liver as well			2
by december , she was on dialysis and had lost all four organs			1
" i was so depressed that i was telling my mother and everyone that i did n't want to live anymore , " @entity23 said			1
" i just wanted to give up because of how many things had gone wrong			2
after a few months , i realized i could either die or try to get better -- and i at least wanted to try			2
" after successfully overcoming pneumonia this year , she was exposed to methicillin - resistant @entity83 , or @entity84 , a skin - borne infection common to hospitals that is difficult to treat			2
with a severely weakened immune system , she remains in an isolation room , where is she being fed through a tube			0
she has not eaten solid food since november			0
" it 's a complex operation , " @entity30 said of the quadruple transplant , " but it 's her only opportunity for survival and a reasonably good quality of life			0
" fortunately , @entity23 and her family are no longer alone in their quest for a donor			1
the @entity102 - based @entity101 of @entity103 has taken up @entity23 's cause after reading about her on @entity106			1
ceo @entity107 and her two sisters , @entity110 and @entity111 , started their organization after finding a kidney donor for their father in 2008 through the popular classified website @entity117			2
they have since capitalized on the power of the @entity120 and social media networks such as @entity106 and @entity122 to give patients more publicity and pair them with donors more quickly			0
" we knew right away this was a rare and challenging case , " @entity107 said			0
" @entity1 's story reminded us of the journey we went through for our father , and we had faith and confidence in knowing we could help			1
" a tale of two transplants the foundation educates the public on the organ donation and transplant process through online efforts as well as at fund - raising events around the country			0
the @entity107 sisters have saved six lives so far -- and they said they hope @entity23 is next			1
" it has been a unique , eye - opening , challenging and empowering experience , " @entity107 said			0
" we are confident that with more awareness and exposure ... we can help @entity1 receive a special family or individual to come forward and donate the gift of life			1
" typically , patients seeking organ transplants register as candidates for the national waiting list through the @entity158 after receiving medical clearance from their hospitals			0
they can either attempt independently to find a family member , friend or stranger to donate to them , or they can wait their turn on the list			2
cases are reviewed based on how sick a patient is , but even though someone such as @entity23 is near the top of the list , about 117,000 other patients vie for potential donations , according to @entity158			1
the process can take anywhere from two to 10 years			0
the @entity107 sisters help patients expedite that waiting period by providing them with a list of potential donors , helping them choose the right hospital and referring them to organizations that can assist with medical expenses			0
once matched with a living donor , a patient contacts his or her hospital , and the transplant occurs once the donor has been medically cleared by a series of tests			2
patients who need the organs of a deceased individual must also wait on the list , as @entity158 determines where to allocate these organs			2
but patients can take the initiative to find a family with a terminally ill loved one and have them consent to donate that person 's organs after he or she has died -- an option the @entity107 sisters are exploring for @entity23			1
many people are unaware of that option , so it does n't happen often			2
" we hope that @entity1 's story is the first step toward changing how families can choose where their loved one 's organs are allocated , " @entity107 said			1
" it is such a confidential process when it does n't have to be			2
this new procedure can make a family or individual feel empowered and not directed to a system			0
it makes the donation process more personable			0
" @entity23 's mother describes her daughter as a bright , inquisitive young woman whose resilience has always belied her physical condition			1
" she has a tremendous love for animals -- she 's shown horses and done a lot of work at shelters , " @entity227 said			0
" she has never seen herself as weak -- she has always been the person who fights for the underdog			0
" a race for life : double lung transplant woman sails @entity238 @entity1 's boyfriend of four years , @entity239 , stayed with her in the hospital for a month over the holidays			1
a geography major in his final semester at @entity243 , @entity244 , he met @entity23 when they were both enrolled at @entity246			1
" it was tough to be there and see everything that she was going through , " he said			0
" we 're pretty positive , but we always look at the other side a bit and think , ' what if ? ' and then we use each other to remind ourselves that we ca n't think about that and to keep a positive outlook			0
" @entity23 said the support from her family , as well from as strangers who have written to her after reading her story , has been overwhelming			1
" i 'm hopeful , " she said			0
" we did it once , and i 'm determined to do it again			0

doctors predicted @entity1 would n't live past her first year
she lost all four organs after a negative reaction to a blood transfusion
@entity23 says she " at least wanted to try " to get better
