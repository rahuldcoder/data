-- they are being billed as the @entity2 of horseshoes but it 's more than just the design that will appeal to jockeys and trainers			1
@entity9 company @entity8 claims to have built a lighter horseshoe by using titanium rather than the traditional cast aluminum			1
it says the shoe can be up to 100 grams lighter , which could mean that horses run faster in races			1
now , 100 grams might not sound like much but as @entity16 -- given a knighthood after coaching @entity18 to glory at the 2003 rugby world cup -- says , such small margins can make the biggest of difference			2
and whereas a pair of shoes made by @entity2 can fetch more than $ 3,200 , a set of four titanium horseshoes costs a mere $ 560			1
" we are aiming to build confidence with the horse and the racing team , " @entity28 , a titanium expert with @entity8 , told @entity0 in an email			1
" we still believe we can take more weight out			0
" in producing the titanium model , scientists scanned a horse 's hooves using a hand - held device before formulating the design with software , @entity8 said in a news release with a headline referring to the famous @entity46 - born designer			2
" four of the customized kicks were printed within only a few hours ! " according to @entity8			0
" it was a team decision when we were trying get people to understand the potential of additive manufacturing and how you do n't have to be an expert designer , " said @entity28			0
" @entity55 scanning provide an easy , affordable way to get a customized object and still have ultimate design flexibility			2
" there are so many ways we can use @entity62 titanium printing			1
" @entity63 , a senior jockey coach at the @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity18 , said the new technology has potential			0
" my job as a jockey coach is to get the riders to understand more about making finer points count , " @entity63 , a flat jockey for 16 years prior to retiring , told @entity0			0
" so if you add all those little points up and all those little 100 grams up , then i think there would be an advantage			0
