-- pity the poor @entity2 airport ; its self - esteem has taken a beating in recent months			1
in february , as reported by the @entity6 , vice president @entity5 said @entity10 's frequently lambasted @entity9 " feels like it 's in some third world country			0
" " why did we lead the world economically for so long ? " @entity5 lamented			0
" we had the most modern infrastructure in the world			0
" in march , the @entity17 - based @entity16 consultancy released its annual list of the world 's top 100 airports			1
the highest ranking any @entity2 airport managed to muster was no. 27 , achieved by the relatively small @entity22			1
now , @entity23 has joined the dogpile			0
after combing through data on more than a million flights in 2013 , the venerable @entity17 magazine concludes in its current issue that @entity2 airports are " awful , " beset by " soggy pizza , surly security staff and endless queues			1
" the @entity23 article poses the million - ( or , rather , multimillion - ) dollar question : " why are foreign airports better than @entity36 's ? " perhaps indicative of the global traveling public 's dismissal of the standards at @entity2 airports , the online article does n't bother to provide an answer			1
best eats at 20 busiest @entity2 airports hope for @entity2 airports ? well ... maybe " there 's no question that @entity2 airports suffer from an image problem globally , and the main culprit is our nation 's lack of dedicated infrastructure investment , particularly in its aviation infrastructure , " @entity36 president and ceo @entity44 said			1
" many of our airports are operating well beyond the capacity for which they were originally intended several decades ago , and this is the reason why air travelers -- international and domestic -- experience crowded terminals and outdated facilities			0
" the other source of harm to our global reputation has been the unacceptably long waiting times to process through customs at @entity2 international airports			2
" @entity44 is optimistic about correcting the problems , pointing to a recent @entity69 announcement that it will add 2,000 officers , many assigned to airports			2
" @entity73 has been working with @entity74 for additional staffing , and with international traffic on the rise , this increase could not have come at a more critical time for @entity2 airports , " @entity44 said			1
@entity80 airport glory days , breathtaking photos @entity83 public funding bedevils performance , improvement at the root of many problems experienced by travelers at @entity2 airports is an atypical system of governance and finance			1
unlike many of their overseas counterparts , @entity2 airports are predominantly owned and operated by city , county or state governments			1
" this means that how they are funded is far more restricted than the rest of the world , " @entity44 said			0
" for our large hub airports , their primary source of funding for capital improvement projects is the @entity107			0
" the charge is a nominal user fee paid by passengers upon purchase of airline tickets in the @entity2 , " virtually all of which , " according to @entity44 , is returned to the airport for investment in infrastructure projects			2
10 of the world 's top airport lounges the problem is , the fee no longer amounts to as much as it once did			0
" the @entity107 's ceiling of $ 4.50 has n't been raised since 2000 , and this has meant that its purchasing power has eroded by roughly half due to inflation over the past 14 years , " says @entity44			0
lack of @entity107 punch has hindered significant improvements and updates at many major @entity2 airports			1
despite all this , @entity44 , and perhaps at least some of the millions of visitors who continue to pour into @entity2 airports each year , remains bullish about the future of @entity2 airports			1
but can @entity2 airports realistically improve vis - a - vis their international counterparts in , say , the next five to 10 years ? " yes , but it 's going to take an unwavering commitment to upgrading our infrastructure , " @entity44 said			2
" it 's crucial that @entity74 and the @entity2 public recognize that infrastructure investment in airports is reinvestment in the communities they connect to rest of the world			2
" and in an increasingly global marketplace , the @entity2 will require world - leading airports to stay competitive			0
" or , by now , simply to catch up to a field that has already , by many estimates , flown far ahead of them			0
and the world 's best airport is ...			0
