-- leadership is a choice			1
when you assume a position of authority , either formally as a manager or informally as a team leader , you make the choice to lead			1
management is the discipline of getting things done right			0
leadership is the art of doing what is right for good of the organization			1
in other words , management is execution ; leadership is inspiration			1
inspiration emerges from purpose , knowing what you do and why you do it			0
organizational purpose emerges from the vision , mission and values of an organization			1
@entity32 is fine example of a purposeful organization			1
its leadership under @entity36 at the helm was focused on producing well - designed products , easy to use as tools of productivity or means of entertainment			2
everyone in @entity32 has been focused on this mission			1
you could say much the same about the @entity47 hotel chain			0
everyone from top to bottom , and that includes maids and wait staff , knows how to deliver a superior guest experience			0
among the ways leaders instill purpose in an organization , according to research conducted my book , lead with purpose , giving your organization a reason to believe in @entity65 , is through communicating the vision , tying customer benefits to employee contributions , and linking work to results			1
creating a purposeful organization is not easy			2
it takes the commitment of senior leaders who hold themselves accountable for delivering on the corporate mission			2
a fine example of this is @entity78 , ceo of @entity79 , a global it services company headquartered in @entity80			0
as @entity78 wrote in his book , @entity87 , @entity88 , " the role of the ceo is to enable people to excel , help them discover their own wisdom , engage themselves entirely in their work , and accept responsibility for making change			0
" toward that end , @entity78 regards himself as a servant of his organization one who holds himself accountable for putting individuals and teams into positions where they can excel			2
purpose is especially necessary in tough times			0
as @entity108 , president of the @entity109 , told me an in an interview : " if people do n't feel the purpose , and do n't feel the goal and [ know ] that they are accomplishing things and moving forward , then depressing news can really bring people down			0
" while purpose is the spark that sets up the vision -- where an organization is headed -- and defines its mission , it becomes inert if not practiced			2
so a leader must " connect the dots " between what an employee does and why it matters to the organization			1
a key example of this is @entity126			1
under the leadership of ceo @entity129 the organization has transformed itself from a struggling company to one that has become the most admired automaker			1
@entity133 to this has been the one @entity126 plan , which is the relentless focus on creating cars and trucks that complement the @entity126 brand globally			1
the beauty of this imperative is not the words ; it 's the action steps			0
employees throughout @entity126 understand the responsibility they have to deliver on one @entity126			1
if you work in manufacturing you understand that decisions and actions you make complement @entity126 's ability to build world - class products			1
or if you work in marketing , you know how your marketing plan for the @entity152 complement the strategic imperative			0
put in other way , purpose becomes personal			0
specificity is critical to purpose			0
i have developed two questions that managers can ask themselves to ensure that they are using purpose as a lever to effect positive results			0
the first , is asking oneself if you are teaching your staff about a purpose			0
secondly , ask if you are ensuring your staff follow through on the shared purpose			0
answers to these questions will enable the leader to provide his team with a goals			2
ways to deliver on this will include briefings from senior management but it will more importantly involve having conversations about what the team is doing and why it matters			2
stories about what is working or what is not can greatly contribute to a greater understanding of purpose			0
leadership is a choice for individuals to make , but the leader must provide his or her team with clear direction founded on purpose and understanding .			1

@entity193 believes leadership is a decision
he cites both @entity32 and @entity126 as two companies who have *successful* leaders
he says a leader must " connect the dots " between what an employee does and why it matters to the organization .
