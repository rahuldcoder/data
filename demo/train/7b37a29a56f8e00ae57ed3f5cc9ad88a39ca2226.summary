-- @entity2 officials say there is strong evidence that @entity6 militias in @entity7 are using @entity9 weapons to attack @entity2 troops , comments that followed reports that @entity7 security forces began cracking down on the groups near @entity9 's border			1
materials found following recent attacks against @entity2 troops " have been traced back to @entity9 origin , " an official told @entity0			1
the claim supports the @entity2 military position that the militias are backed by @entity9 , a charge @entity25 has long denied			1
the material collected indicates the militias are using @entity9 materials in " improvised rocket - assisted munitions " attacks against @entity2 forces , the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said saturday			1
the official was not authorized to release the information to the media			0
the munitions , or @entity39 , are metal canisters packed with explosives and propelled by rockets			0
@entity39 along with armor - piercing grenades are believed responsible for the majority of @entity2 deaths in recent months , the official said			2
the official acknowledged the weapons could have been assembled and manufactured elsewhere , but said @entity39 are a signature weapon of the militant group @entity50 , which is " funded by @entity9 and receives training there			0
" the news about the weapons arose as @entity7 security forces began a crackdown in the volatile @entity56 province , a @entity6 stronghold in southern @entity7 that serves as one of the main arteries from @entity9			1
the @entity2 military has not been asked by the @entity7 government " to provide any substantial assistance so far to the operations reported in @entity56 province , " army maj. gen. @entity60 , the top @entity2 military spokesman in @entity7 , told @entity0			1
@entity7 's southern provinces make up the majority of the @entity6 heartland , home to the holy cities of @entity71 and @entity72			0
it is in this area where a majority of the @entity6 militia attacks have been launched against @entity2 troops , who operate from a number of bases in the region			0
" while it is clear these militias receive training and weapons from @entity9 -- using them as proxies for @entity9 's own agendas in the region -- we have no evidence of @entity9 forces being directly engaged in the recent violence in @entity7 , " @entity60 said in an email late saturday			1
@entity60 said the @entity2 is encouraged by the @entity7 operation , though the security in @entity7 remains complex			2
while violence has dramatically fallen off since the height of sectarian violence that nearly tore the country apart , attacks and bombings remain a daily occurrence			0
the recent increase in attacks pushed june 's death toll to the highest this year for @entity7 security forces and civilians			1
more than 270 people , including 155 civilians , were killed in attacks , @entity7 authorities said			0
fourteen @entity2 soldiers were also killed in combat - related incidents in june , the largest loss of life among @entity2 troops in @entity7 since 2008 , according to @entity0 figures			2
the roughly 47,000 @entity2 troops in @entity7 are due to withdraw by january 1 , 2012 , under a @entity2 - @entity7 security pact , though @entity7 prime minister @entity119 is consulting with lawmakers over whether to request troops stay beyond the deadline			2
the @entity2 military has said the shiite - militias -- @entity50 , @entity125 , and the @entity126 -- are using the bombings to try to take credit for driving @entity2 forces out of the country			1
" if anything , these groups have proven to be resilient and we have no doubt they will continue to conduct violent attacks in the months ahead , " @entity60 said			0
he said @entity7 's best weapon against the violence was to continue targeting the groups			0
@entity0 's @entity138 contributed to this report .			0
