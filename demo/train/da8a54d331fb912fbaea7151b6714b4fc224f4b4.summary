@entity0 -- terrorists intent on striking commercial aircraft have shown renewed interest in surgically implanting explosives in humans to circumvent airport security , a @entity3 security official tells @entity1			1
the idea of implanting bombs has been discussed in the past , but the @entity3 has obtained fresh intelligence about the desire of terrorists to implant devices , according to the official			1
another @entity3 official said @entity18 , the top bomb maker for @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , is suspected of being behind the latest efforts			1
" he 's @entity20 's bomb guy , " said the official			1
@entity18 is also believed to be behind the thwarted 2009 @entity24 day " underwear " bomb , the failed october 2010 cargo plane bomb and an attempt to kill a @entity28 prince using a concealed bomb both officials said there is no specific or imminent threat			0
but the new intelligence prompted officials last week to brief international airlines and @entity3 allies overseas , a @entity36 spokesman said			1
" we are treating this information seriously , and as a precautionary matter , sharing it with our colleagues overseas and of course @entity3 carriers who travel overseas , " @entity36 administrator @entity41 told @entity1			1
" we see this as the latest iteration or the evolution of what terrorist groups are trying to do to circumvent our security layers and to perhaps defeat our societal norms , " he said			1
" the information is that terrorists are aware of this type of technique and interested in using it , but there is no specific threat as to a date and time and a specific flight , " he said			1
the @entity36 said full - body scanners can not see underneath skin , but said other " overlapping layers of security " could help officials deter any plot involving a human bomb			2
those layers include intelligence information about possible plots , equipment that checks for minute traces of explosives , behavior detection officers and canine teams			2
" all of those layers of security gives us the strongest defense and the best opportunity to detect and deter this from happening , " @entity41 said wednesday			2
@entity36 spokesman @entity85 said passengers flying from international locations to @entity3 destinations may notice additional security measures in place			1
measures may include interaction with passengers , in addition to the use of other screening methods such as pat - downs and the use of enhanced tools and technologies , @entity85 said			2
" these measures are designed to be unpredictable , so passengers should not expect to see the same activity at every international airport , " @entity85 said			1
a trauma surgeon contacted by @entity1 said terrorists could use a variety of techniques to conceal bombs in a human , ranging from crude surgery that would likely result in infections , fever and other complications , to more sophisticated procedures that would take greater skill , but could last a long time before causing problems			2
terrorists could replicate a cosmetic device , such as a breast or buttock implant , said dr. @entity123 , of the @entity124			2
" in many types of infections after surgery , there can be a kind of honeymoon period of a few days			0
but once you get several days after the operation , i think that 's when you 'd start to see signs that would begin with pain and fever			0
that would get worse and worse , and ultimately be fatal if nothing were done , " he said			0
an aviation security consultant said news of terrorists ' interest in implants shows the " continuous competition between terrorists and the defenders , where we always try to be one step ahead , and they try to do the same			1
" " i think we have come to the point where our technology capabilities have been exhausted to the limit , and right now there 's no further technology that can be applied to mitigate this kind of risk , " said consultant @entity151			0
the @entity36 does not have the option of subjecting people to medical doses of x-rays to find concealed objects , he said			0
" so we are very much now one step behind ( terrorists ) , rather than one step ahead			0
" @entity151 said the @entity36 is right to focus more attention on airline passengers , instead of on the bags they carry			0
a person with an implant bomb would likely exhibit signs of stress that could be detected by trained personnel , @entity151 said			0
" one thing obviously is an elevated level of stress , and in ( the case of a human bomb ) it would probably be extreme , " @entity151 said			0
" you may also see some influence of drugs to ease pain			0
" @entity1 correspondent @entity183 , national security producer @entity184 and producer @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
