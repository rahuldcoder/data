@entity0 -- to veto or not to veto : it 's up to @entity4 gov. @entity3			1
she must decide if she is going to sign into law legislation that would allow business owners , as long as they assert their religious beliefs , to deny service to gay and lesbian customers			0
if she approves it , the state could face litigation and a boycott , potentially harming @entity4 's economy and tourism industry as well as next year 's @entity18			1
@entity4 lawmakers pass controversial anti-gay bill @entity3 told @entity1 her decision will come after she returns later this week to @entity4 from @entity0 , where she has been attending the @entity24 meetings			1
" i have to look at what it says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing , " she told @entity1			2
the bill was sent to @entity3 on monday and she has five days to sign it , veto it , or do nothing and it would become law			1
she has been a conservative champion for much of her five years in office			2
and if that 's any indication , the measure could very well become law			2
but it 's not that straightforward			2
her conservative creds as secretary of state , @entity3 landed the gubernatorial gig in 2009 after previous gov. @entity46 left her job to head the @entity48			1
just over a year into her tenure , @entity3 rose to national prominence after signing @entity52 into law , a strict immigration measure also known as the " show me your papers " law that allows law enforcement ask people for legal documents , which critics say leads to racial profiling of @entity63			1
she made national headlines again for wagging her finger at president @entity69 on a @entity71 tarmac after he stepped off of @entity72 over immigration			0
in her bid for re-election in 2012 , she won the endorsement of the @entity77 , even though her primary opponent sat on the organization 's board of directors			0
the endorsement was well - earned , as was her a + rating			0
under her , @entity4 became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit			1
and people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed			0
but her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said @entity4 would participate in the controversial expansion of @entity97 under the @entity98			1
many conservative governors chose to opt out but @entity3 called it a " moral " obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured			1
@entity105 record while social and religious conservatives hope her conservative principles continue to guide her action regarding the @entity105 measure , her record on lesbian and gay issues is thin			1
@entity113 , vice president of @entity114 , said that @entity3 's record on related issues is " largely unproven			1
" while she vetoed a similar measure last year , it was had nothing to do with the content of the bill but political power plays inside the @entity124			0
the one substantive time she acted was not on the side of gay rights			0
she ended domestic partner benefits for state employees , which was a measure her predecessor implemented			0
@entity3 said the state could n't afford it and she defended her decision in court			1
" she 's been mostly silent on the issue of marriage equality and those types of things , " @entity113 said			0
lgbt rights : the patchwork states of @entity144 some insight where @entity3 has a proven record is in the area of @entity4 businesses , cutting regulations and taxes			1
and that could provide the clearest signal on what @entity3 might do this week			1
the religious freedom bill , @entity155 , is opposed by some of influential business groups in @entity4			1
a letter sent to @entity3 on monday by numerous business leaders encouraged her to oppose the measure			2
" after analyzing the bill , we are very concerned about the effect it could have on @entity4 's economy , " the letter , signed by the @entity163 among others , said			1
" we can not support measures that could expose our businesses to litigation , nor do we want to send a message that our state is anything but an open and attractive place for visitors and the top talent that will be the cornerstone of our continued economic growth			0
" and @entity3 is well liked among the business community			2
" we believe she 's done more than any governor national wide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state , " @entity181 , spokesman for the @entity163 , said			0
" we know this governor always does what she believes is in the best interest of the state			0
" and lgbt rights ' groups hope that her close ties with the business community is enough to convince her to oppose it			0
" this is where we hope her pro-business stance will prevail , " @entity113 said			0
growing support @entity3 is also facing growing support for a veto			2
is same - sex marriage no longer a political issue ? public pressure is mounting			0
another major protest took place monday evening outside the state @entity124			0
businesses are hanging signs in their windows that read " open for business to everyone ! " both @entity4 senators , republicans @entity214 and @entity216 , have publicly urged @entity3 to veto			1
and according to the local newspaper in @entity220 , state sen. @entity217 , who voted for the measure , is now urging @entity3 to pick up her veto pen			2
while the measure is not about same - sex marriage , a likely indicator of where @entity224 stand on the @entity225 is a @entity229 's @entity228 from last year			2
it found that a majority of @entity224 support same - sex marriage			0
@entity233 , an @entity234 professor of political science , noted that " it 's an extreme measure even for ( conservative ) @entity4			1
" " she 'll be viewed more reasonable than liberal " if she vetoes it , @entity233 said			0
a spokesman for the @entity241 , which will host @entity242 , in @entity243 next february , said the league is watching developments in @entity4			1
" our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness , and prohibit discrimination based on age , gender , race , religion , sexual orientation , or any other improper standard , " @entity246 said			0
@entity1 's @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity241 , which will host @entity18 in @entity4 next year , says it is *monitoring* situation
gov. @entity3 says she will " do the right thing " for @entity4
@entity3 's conservative record might indicate what she will do
but @entity105 advocates are *pinning* their hopes on her pro-business ties
