-- your own hammam , a personal chef and a chauffeur to smooth your way to the slopes -- they 're all part of the package for the ultra upper - crust skier			1
in fact , the après - ski 's so tempting at these sumptuous retreats you might be tempted to skip the skiing altogether			1
chalet @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity18 if you seek your thrills off - piste as much as on , this is the place : goodies include a hammam for rapid defrosting , a 10 - meter heated indoor pool and a @entity27 bar			1
the crisp @entity18 air should cure any effects of overindulgence -- and the chalet 's setting , sandwiched between the @entity34 and @entity35 lift stations , puts you on top of the main network of pistes above @entity17			1
you could plot your entire day 's skiing from the floor - to - ceiling windows , the view extending to that toasty pool			1
chalet @entity44 ; +41 79 412 7398 ; from @entity45 , 700 ( $ 32,650 ) a week @entity46 , @entity47 1850 , @entity48 @entity51 's @entity50 , the @entity52 president @entity50 and assorted @entity54 oligarchs might , based on reported past attendance , be among your fellow skiers at so - called " @entity56 in the snow			1
" where to retire from all the paparazzi , gawkers and generally less fortunate people when you 've finished skiing for the day ? prime pick is the ski - in / ski - out @entity64			1
the 10 - meter private pool , plus steam and massage rooms should soothe any aching limbs			1
but it 's the lavish extras , including butler and private - jet transfer ( if needed ) , that seal its elite status			1
if you only had your own private mountain to ski on , too , you would n't have to mingle with ordinary people at all			1
@entity46 ; +44 203 465 9130 ; from $ 52,945 a week @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity48 @entity80 may have lost out to @entity47 as the premier luxury ski resort but , with lodgings such as @entity84 , it 's hardly slumming it			1
the tiger skin on the black slate floor and the @entity87 in the entrance hall make for a décor that 's more rap star cool than classic chalet chic , and if @entity93 has n't already checked in he should be given a freebie for promotional purposes			1
doubtless he 'd appreciate the black - granite surrounds of the " rain shower " in the master suite , plus @entity100 and log fire			0
and if he considered skiing rather than shooting his next video on site , the chalet 's mere minutes from the resort of @entity80 , with 124 slopes -- or 30 mountain restaurants , depending on your preference			2
then again , @entity84 has its own chef			0
@entity79 ; +44 1242 547705 ; from $ 24,135 per weekve @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 @entity114 and @entity115 are among the a-listers to have been papped at @entity112 , a destination blessed with good snowfall at low latitudes			0
the hexagonal @entity111 is plugged as the resort 's " flagship " chalet -- though with four floors it feels more like an entire boutique hotel			2
there 's a lift to the l - shaped living space on the top floor , but it 's on the lower ground level where the fun really begins : the " wellness area " there includes a swimming pool , sauna , in - and outdoor hot tubs and a massage room with beauty therapist on call			2
plus there 's a private 12 - seater cinema for when you 've toweled off			1
step outside and you 'll find yourself in the resort suburb of @entity144 , a 10 - minute drive from the action			0
not that you 'll need to walk -- residents get a chauffeured 4x4			0
chalet artemis ; +44 ( 0 ) 208 682 5050 ; from $ 3,415 per person , per week , based on 12 sharing @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 as one of @entity155 's most southerly resorts -- and among its sunniest skiing spots -- @entity151 is on the up			2
the @entity158 rival the @entity159 on looks alone -- and that 's before you consider the excellent snow falling from december to april			0
newcomer @entity164 might not quite compete with the most exclusive @entity18 and @entity48 resorts but this is a sweet retreat , nonetheless			1
beside the inevitable pool big enough for a neighborhood gym , there are six bedrooms with en suites and piste - view horizontal windows that look like the widest widescreen tvs you can imagine			0
the wooden dining table stretching along the al fresco terrace -- which overlooks distant @entity178 , one of the world 's oldest cities -- provides a rustic touch but , do n't fret , you need n't cook anything			0
the in - villa manager and chef free guests from lifting ski - tired limbs unnecessarily			2
@entity164 ; +359 888 566 872 ; from $ 11,780 week a week @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity191 ver voted @entity191 's @entity193 at the last @entity194 , this former hunting lodge mingles cozy with chic			2
creature comforts at the 16th - century retreat deep in @entity189 forest include a @entity200 sauna , @entity202 bath and vast stone wine cellar with vintages from @entity205 and beyond			2
snowbirds flock here for the cross-country and alpine skiing around @entity210 and the @entity211			0
hands - on owners @entity214 and @entity215 can arrange alternative activities including winter paragliding and porcini - mushroom hunting -- the top onsite chef will cook your foraged finds			0
@entity188 , 39030 @entity222 ; +39 474 404042 ; from $ 3,260 per day based on two guests ( plus $ 135 a day per additional adult ) @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 set in the wilderness of @entity229 , 250 kilometers inside the @entity230 , remote @entity226 suits the more intrepid skier			1
its 25 pistes include four black and 10 red runs , as well as easier slopes			0
the @entity238 runs and off - piste trails are for the truly firm - thighed ; heli - skiing and snowmobile safaris are also on the menu			0
but even this testing terrain need n't preclude a little luxury -- or a lot			0
@entity246 , part of the @entity248 , has the de rigeur sauna and @entity100 beneath the stars , as well as a dedicated chef preparing gastronomic five - course meals			0
higher levels of luxury -- literally -- are available at the same hotel 's @entity255			2
at 1,228 meters above sea level , it 's @entity227 's highest - set mountain abode			0
@entity259 ; +44 1483 425 465 ; from 24,990 sek ( $ 3,838 ) per week			0

chalet @entity15 , in @entity18 , has its own hammam for après - ski defrosting
a butler and private - jet transfer are one @entity47 lodge 's claim to fame
a @entity229 ski retreat within the @entity230 lays on luxury at serious *altitude*
