-- the brief detention in @entity2 , @entity3 , last week of a @entity5 , @entity6 , church group comes on the heels of the detention of an @entity10 contractor and could indicate an increasingly chilly reception for some @entity10 visitors , according to the church travelers			1
the december 26 trip for 14 members of the @entity16 of @entity5 is a reminder of the entrenched tensions between @entity3 and the @entity10 despite the @entity21 administration 's loosening of previous restrictions			1
the church group was traveling on a @entity10 - issued license and planned to do humanitarian work			1
the group was denied entry to @entity3			2
part of the group spent the night detained inside the @entity2 airport before being put on a plane to @entity30 , the church 's social justice minister , the rev. @entity31 , told @entity0			1
the most recent trip was under a religious license , but the bulk of the mission was to be devoted to projects such as an @entity39 clinic and teaching women how to make baby clothes the church made three trips in november without incident , but things went sour almost immediately after the 14 volunteers exited the plane in december , one of the participants , @entity49 , told @entity0			1
most of the group passed through customs without a problem , but five members of the group were stopped and had their passports and licenses checked , @entity50 said			0
@entity50 said she told the @entity3 officials , " we love the @entity3			2
we have many friends here ; there is no reason to keep us out of the country			0
" the @entity3 authorities told the five that they were not allowed inside @entity3 because they were there for religious reasons and forced them to wait for almost an hour and a half before putting them on a commercial flight back to @entity30 , from where they had traveled			1
@entity50 pointed out the @entity10 gives travel permits to @entity3 for religious work , but the island , at least in this case , rejected the group for the same reason			1
" it 's a total @entity82 , " she said			0
the reason for the brusque treatment is likely because of the detention of another @entity10 earlier this month , several church members said			2
the detained man , whose name has not been released , is a subcontractor for @entity90 , an international development group on contract with the @entity10 government to promote human rights in @entity3			1
@entity3 leader @entity95 said that the man was detained because he was distributing satellite communications equipment in order to destabilize @entity3			2
for nearly a half a century , the @entity10 has maintained a trade embargo against @entity3 that many on the island nation have blamed for their country 's woes			1
" i do n't blame the @entity3 government , or our government , but i truly believe something has to be done to normalize relations , " @entity50 said			0
the nine others who had already passed through customs faced additional questioning and were detained inside the airport overnight , @entity109 , who was part of that group , told @entity0			2
later , it was learned that @entity3 authorities considered imprisoning them , she said			1
instead , they were left to find a place to sleep on the floor of the airport			0
the group ended up sleeping underneath a staircase , using fabric they brought for the clothes - making project as sheets , @entity109 said			0
the next morning , they were put on a plane to @entity30			2
the @entity3 officials " were rude and cold and indifferent , " @entity109 said			0
" it was very psychologically disarming			0
" but , @entity132 and others made clear , they were not mistreated by the @entity3			0
" we 're upset because of the treatment , but ultimately , we want the policy to change , " she said			0
" i hope goodwill and improvement of relations will come out of this incident , moving the two countries beyond the my - belt - is - bigger - than - your - belt diplomacy of the last half century			0
