" some skilful finger work and balancing is needed			0
i suspect it 's a bit like golf , practice , practice , practice			0

on @entity48 , the 24 - year - old announced on @entity49 his " first victory of 2014 " as he revealed he was engaged to @entity51 tennis player @entity50			2
the pair have been dating since september 2011 , but if media rumors were to be believed their romance has endured some difficult moments , particularly as both slipped down the rankings in their respective sports in 2013			0
but @entity1 , now the world no. 7 , told the media ahead of the @entity7 tournament that he is feeling more focused , especially as a would - be married man			2
