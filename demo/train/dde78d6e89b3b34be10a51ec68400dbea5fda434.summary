-- i am a 38 - year - old father of two little boys living in @entity3 , @entity4 , and i like my circumcised penis			1
however , when it came time to decide the fate of my sons ' own genitalia , my wife and i bucked the trend and let them live as they were born			1
first , to be clear : i 'm no " intactivist			2
" i do not feel nearly that passionately about the subject			1
i have absolutely no problem with anyone who decides to circumcise his or her child			1
and the @entity23 's newly revised policy statement will not , in my opinion , make the issue any clearer for expectant parents -- it remains artfully ambiguous			2
yet , the revised policy does clearly state that the procedure should be covered by insurance			2
this will likely lead to greater access to circumcisions , which will surely be heralded by advocates			2
but for me , the decision came down to my penchant to leave well enough alone			2
i figure that nature knows better than i do about how to make a penis			2
parenting : a history of circumcision i 'm not worried about the hygiene issues that are potentially related to uncircumcised penises			1
they are minor and rare			0
besides , my boys are lucky enough to be able to bathe in clean water just about every day			0
i 'll take the time to show them how to clean themselves just as the parent of a little girl must teach her to wash her vagina carefully			0
considering that some estimate a 1.5 percent complication frequency rate among newly circumcised infants , i 'm ok with my boys ' risking the infrequent urinary tract infection			1
there is , i suppose , a slightly higher risk of @entity59 transmission and other sexually transmitted infections for uncircumcised males			0
but i trust that i 'll be able to convey the importance of proper condom use when my boys reach the appropriate age			0
should teens make circumcision decision ? before the birth of my first son , most of the parental backyard barbecue banter dealt with either aesthetics or tradition			1
who was going to opt for the knife -- and why -- had a lot to do with personal preference , it seemed			0
practical health issues and religious adherents were rarely , if ever , discussed			0
either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just did n't care if they did n't			0
there was some talk among the women about whether circumcised penises were " cuter " than uncircumcised penises			1
while amusing , i did not find any real substance in these discussions			0
there is also an argument to be made that circumcision , in effect , mutilates the genitals of a minor without their consent , which strikes me as neither fair nor particularly holistic			1
i ca n't help but wonder if the practice of male circumcision , as with female genital mutilation , has something to do with a fear of human sexuality and a desire to control			1
but it is interesting to note that the @entity107 sure does n't think so : in 2010 , the @entity108 stated that non-therapeutic male circumcision " conflicts with the child 's right to autonomy and physical integrity			1
" they went as far as to claim that there are as many good reasons for prohibition of male circumcision as there are for female genital mutilation			1
parenting : why i decided to circumcise my sons i had a good friend who chose to get circumcised when we were in the eighth grade			1
i believe that he was solely motivated by pressure to look like his male peers			0
he was out of school for a week			0
i remember him telling me about the excruciating pain associated with the procedure			1
he was in pain for at least a week post-operation			1
adolescents like to exaggerate , but i believed him			0
i remembered this anecdote when it came time to make the decision for my sons			2
i did not have any desire to subject my beautiful baby boys to excruciating pain , even with analgesia			1
the thought of forcing them to endure another traumatic experience right after birth seemed cruel			0
parenting : how a circumcision is actually performed besides , the perception of what a " normal " penis should look like is rapidly changing			2
our doctor here in @entity3 informed my wife and me that the circumcision rate was nearing 30 % locally -- a far cry from the approximately 80 % rate of the 1960s			1
thirty percent is a lot closer to the global ratio			0
so , even if we move away from @entity3 someday ( and go ahead , make all the @entity163 jokes you want ) , the likelihood that my boys ' penises will be accepted is pretty high			0
the day will come when one of my boys will want to know why his penis is different than mine			0
it has n't happened yet although the oldest is only 3			0
when it does , i will look him in the eye and tell him that people did things differently when i was born -- no big deal			2

@entity191 is circumcised , but chose not to circumcise his sons
he says he and his wife decided to let their children " live as they were born "
@entity182 recalls a friend who *underwent* circumcision as an eighth - grader
he says he could not subject his infant sons to excruciating pain
