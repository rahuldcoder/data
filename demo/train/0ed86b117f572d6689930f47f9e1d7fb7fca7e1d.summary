-- medals and reputations will be won and lost at the @entity3 -- but forget the events , just who will triumph in the fashion stakes at the @entity7 ? it is not just the kit athletes will wear on the track or in the pool which will make a splash , it is also the official uniforms which will be worn for friday 's opening ceremony			1
as a designer , striking the right style chord can ensure your kit will be immortalized and cherished in the memories of a nation			2
get it wrong , and the fashionista police will never let you forget it			0

@entity40 , who generated sales of $ 16.3 million in 2011 and supply @entity44 's apparel , have their eyes on upping their share of a @entity48 sportswear market worth $ 5.5 billion			1
the @entity50 company has a long - standing relationship with @entity52 , the daughter of music legend and former @entity55 @entity54 , and she has designed the uniforms for the host @entity44 squad			1
" this project has really means a lot to me being a @entity48 designer and working with @entity44 at a time like this , when we are hosting the @entity7 in @entity64 for 2012 , " @entity54 told @entity0			1
" it really goes beyond anything i 've ever done before and it 's just such an incredible honor			2
" being a designer , a fashion designer this is not the type of opportunity that normally comes your way and i feel really very lucky and privileged			2
it 's been a really exciting challenge			2
" @entity54 is facing some top - level competition from the likes of @entity79 fashion house @entity77 as well as @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 , who have been brought in by other @entity28 associations to work on their kits and uniforms			1
" there were a million different things to consider with this role , " explained @entity54			2
" number one was trying to identify what makes a country , to show the pride of the nation and translate that into clothing , while taking into account the necessary technical achievement			0
" it also involves looking at the best athletes in the world and how to do them proud and to help enhance and support their performance			0
" while making sure the kit is fit for purpose , @entity54 was also keen for each kit to safeguard the masculinity and femininity of competitors			0
" every athlete i talked to have said they perform better when they feel confident about how they look , so i really tried to do that , " said @entity54			0
" another thing is how to look masculine and feminine with that and still keep the dignity of the athlete			0
" also , how everything will come across visually on television , when billions of people are watching it , to try and make it different			0
there are a million things to think of , working with a lot of guidelines			0

@entity134 , who will make his @entity3 bow in the cycling road race on saturday , said on @entity137 : " just arrived at the @entity3 , got all me kit , still think @entity52 was a bit @entity139 in the @entity141 when she knocked this one up , " a reference to one of @entity54 's @entity145 's classic records			1
" in a good way , certainly gon na ( sic ) stand out , " added @entity134 in a subsequent tweet			0
the confidence gained from looking slick is something @entity150 , fashion course director at @entity64 's @entity152 , believes could give athletes the edge when it comes to winning medals			1
" it is important that leading athletes are given the confidence of looking their best at such an important occasion when all the world is observing them , " said @entity150			0
" this should be provided by the best designers available			0
a versatile designer can turn their talents to a range of aesthetics within the parameters of sporting attire			0
" @entity150 also detailed the possible benefits for designers able to attach their name to a successful @entity28 squad , both in terms of reputation and financially			1
