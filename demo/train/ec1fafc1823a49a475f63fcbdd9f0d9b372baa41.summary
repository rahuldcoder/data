the @entity1 faced a newly pressing question in recent weeks : what constitutes an online " threat " ? police reviewed hundreds of online postings -- and made several arrests -- over alleged anti-cop threats made in the wake of the killing of two officers last month			1
it used to be a lot easier to define threats			0
it 's not that our dialogue has evolved much			2
art and music have always spoken about violence in the most graphic terms , whether it 's in rap lyrics or @entity25 songs			2
kids have consumed violent art and speech since long before @entity29 baked a witch in an oven , or @entity32 hacked his way through @entity35			2
the difference today is the delivery system : the @entity38 and social media			1
suppose , after the recent @entity1 threats , i posted that i planned to " swarm on any m.			1
. in a blue uniform , " meaning specifically the " punk police			0
" suppose i promise that " when i finish , it is going to be a bloodbath of cops dyin			0
' " scary right ? if i tweeted that today , i might expect police at my door			0
in 1988 , though , there was no @entity51 ... or e-mail ... or " online , " come to think of it , when the rap group @entity54 came out with its ( famous ) " @entity55 , " containing those very lyrics			0
people then were offended , of course			0
but songs on an album just do n't seem to contain the same direct threat potential of social media today			1
there was something very nonspecific about threatening language contained on a commercially mass - produced cassette tape			2
and when a megastar like @entity67 sang in 1988 that he had to kill a woman for complaining too much , and bury her in his backyard , millions heard those lyrics			0
that 's a much bigger audience than the 13 followers reading some guy 's rabid musings on @entity51			0
so , threatening speech online is not about how viral or far - reaching it is			2
our society is not as interested in protecting social media rants as it is in protecting artists because — whether the courts say it or not — we really do n't feel as good about protecting dummies			1
we will vigorously protect the free speech of legitimate artists , even if we find their work repulsive			0
instinctively , however , we draw the line at people whose only creative accomplishments consist of , say , a bitter child custody dispute and access to a @entity94 signal			2
it seems that if some shmendrik wants to rant on the @entity38 , he should be able to point to a scintilla of an actual music career to defend his or her language by claiming it is like " lyrics			0
" that analysis dovetails nicely with the issues before the @entity107 in a case called @entity109 v. @entity110			2
in @entity111 , an " aspiring rapper " used violent language on @entity113 to rant about his wife , an elementary school and an @entity118 agent			0
under the @entity121 , the court must decide whether a " threat " requires proof of the defendant 's actual intent to threaten , or if it is enough to show that a " reasonable person " would regard the statement as threatening			1
if the court ultimately requires proof of actual intent , that test would be a higher burden , and more favorable to defendants			0
but even under the " reasonable person " standard favored by prosecutors , the hearer of the words must understand them as a threat			0
maybe this is why social media has more threat potential , and it 's not because it can reach many persons : social media is more threatening for its potential to reach one specific person — but be overheard by many others			1
maybe that 's the key			0
in that sense , social media threats are less like a musical performance , and more like a menacing phone call placed on speakerphone for others to hear , or a call surreptitiously recorded by your @entity158 girlfriend ( as with @entity160 )			1
social media postings are ( generally ) not for profit , and they are authored by the speaker alone			1
in that sense they feel more like the unfiltered statements of present intent			0
as protective as we should be of free speech in art , maybe it 's time to draw the line at social media			1
then again , i 'm biased in a way that perhaps the justices are not			0
i 'm on social media , and the tweets directed at me from time to time are , let 's say , pretty threatening and too profane to reprint here			1
maybe the justices would be less inclined to equate the lyrics of @entity182 ( as justice @entity183 recently did ) with the poetic musings of frighteningly abusive tweeters if they had more personal experience with social media			1
the @entity1 confronts a similar problem			2
how is it to know the difference between a true threat , the work of an artist , or some troll sounding off online ? the @entity107 may contain the brightest minds of our time , but compared with your average 14 - year - old , they are @entity200			1
i 've never seen a hashtag in a @entity107 opinion , and i seriously doubt the justices spend a lot of time on @entity206			1
tasked as they are with defining threats on social media , will their reasoned opinion reflect a current understanding of how people communicate — or threaten — online ? even if they do , by then the kids will be onto the next thing anyway			1

@entity217 : arrests over tweets threatening @entity1 raise issue of when speech is threat
he says @entity107 to weigh in soon . maybe it 's time to draw threat line at social media
