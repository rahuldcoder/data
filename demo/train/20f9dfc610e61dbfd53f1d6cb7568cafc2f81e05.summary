-- it was the most devastating news an unsuspecting new parent could ever hear			2
i could n't wrap my brain around what the neurologist was telling me			2
finally , i stopped her			2
" is this bad , " i asked			2
" yes , " she replied			2
" so what you 're telling me is that my son has a fatal disease ? " " yes , " she said again			1
it was like someone had just pushed me off a cliff			2
our son @entity16 was diagnosed with @entity18 in may 2010 when he was 22 months old			1
at the time of his diagnosis , he was asymptomatic , and he still is -- but the clock is ticking			2
our geneticist gave us the best advice she could give in this situation			2
she told us that this did n't have to be a death sentence for @entity16			1
with the scientific advancements happening now , treatments that were unimaginable a few years ago are becoming a reality			2
this was all we needed to hear			2
we hit the ground running			1
a few weeks later , @entity32 was formed			1
the foundation is aimed at curing @entity34			1
we have two goals : to drive the science that will ultimately lead to a cure , and to raise awareness for all rare diseases			1
actor @entity40 of the tv show " elementary " is running a 50 - mile ultra-marathon in honor of @entity32			1
having him endorse us is a dream come true , and i 'll never be able to thank him enough			2
we 've also formed a consortium of scientists , clinicians and parents all focused on saving our children 's lives			1
we call this consortium hands ( helping @entity56 )			0
today , we have four research projects in the works			0
in the coming weeks we will announce the official @entity34 patient registry and a natural history study , which follows a group of people with a disease over time			1
a child 's struggle inspires drive for cure @entity34 is caused by a single gene defect			1
because of that defect , an enzyme is not produced			0
this enzyme 's job is to break down heparan sulfate , a long sugar chain			1
if the heparan sulfate is not broken down , it 's stored in every cell , and that causes a cascade of bodily dysfunctions			1
first affected is the central nervous system , causing profound brain damage			0
also typical is hearing and vision loss , organ damage and bone deformities			0
eventually a person dies after becoming unable to eat , walk or talk			0
there are four different enzymes responsible for breaking down heparan sulfate : they are designated a , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity16 has @entity91 , which along with @entity92 is ultra-rare and occurs in one of 1.4 million births			1
type a ( one in 100,000 births ) and @entity89 ( one in 200,000 births ) are more common and thought to be more severe			0
most children with those types do n't live past their teenage years			0
@entity90 and @entity92 children usually have less severe symptoms			0
the children suffer brain damage in early elementary school ; some live into their mid- 20s			0
most children succumb to organ failure or upper respiratory infections			0
a rare disease in the smallest of patients children appear normal at birth , meeting their milestones			1
during the preschool years parents start to notice something wrong and the children seem to slow developmentally			0
their speech is delayed , in part due to accumulated fluid in the middle ears			0
they have constant ear and upper respiratory infections , along with diarrhea			0
the texture of their hair turns kinky and thick			0
the children are described as having " coarse " features -- protruding foreheads , thick eyebrows , flat noses and full lips			0
next the children start to behave erratically , with hyperactivity , sleep disturbances and compulsions			0
the skills they have learned fall by the wayside			0
they are back in diapers , wandering aimlessly			0
some stop sleeping for days			0
@entity16 is 4 years old now , and we 've seen no sign of cognitive delay or regression			1
he does have a speech delay because of fluid in his middle ear , and he is on his third set of tubes			0
he 's constantly congested and has minor bone deformities -- flared ribs and a raised sternum , for example			1
he goes to preschool full - time and has speech , occupational and physical therapy			1
he 's happy and full of life , a character and the light of our lives			1
there are close to 7,000 rare diseases affecting about 25 million people in the @entity170 , according to the @entity171			1
about 80 % of them are genetic , and it is estimated about half affect children			0
@entity34 is not complicated like @entity176 's or @entity177 's , it 's just ultra-rare , so the pharmaceutical industry has not taken notice			2
very few federal dollars are allocated for funding rare disease research , and most go toward the diseases with larger patient populations			1
a disease is considered rare in the @entity170 if fewer than 200,000 people have it			1
@entity188 has a known patient population of 16 kids in the @entity170			0
living with a rare disease , making a difference it 's left to the parents to lay all the groundwork to de-risk treatments for the drug makers			1
our consortium wants to create a patient registry , conduct a natural history study and fund a treatment so we can hand it over to a drug company in hopes a treatment will be created			0
@entity16 could be the first child to ever walk away from @entity34 type @entity206 he 's priceless , and just like the thousands of other children affected by a rare and fatal genetic disease , he deserves a chance to live .			1

@entity213 's 4 - year - old son @entity16 has a rare and fatal disease
her family has formed a foundation to seek a cure and raise awareness
tv star @entity40 is running an ultra-marathon to benefit the foundation
