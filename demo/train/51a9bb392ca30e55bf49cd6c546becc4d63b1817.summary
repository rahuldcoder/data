@entity0 -- a federal advisory board 's recommendation that women in their 40s should avoid routine mammograms is not government policy and has caused " a great deal of confusion , " @entity3 secretary @entity2 said wednesday			1
" my message to women is simple			2
mammograms have always been an important life - saving tool in the fight against breast cancer , and they still are today , " @entity2 said in a statement			1
" keep doing what you have been doing for years : talk to your doctor about your individual history , ask questions and make the decision that is right for you			0
" with her statement , @entity2 waded into the controversy over monday 's announcement by the @entity28 that women in their 40s should not get routine mammograms for early detection of breast cancer			1
@entity2 ' statement is aimed at " making it clear these recommendations are not ours , " a @entity33 source said			1
the report " should n't be dismissed , " @entity2 said on @entity1 's " @entity38			1
" but she added , " there are other groups who have disagreed with this information			0
" the task force is " making recommendations , not coverage decisions , not payment decisions			0
" @entity49 health programs such as @entity50 will continue to cover routine mammograms , she said			1
" we will continue to recommend it , and the health plans have indicated that they will do the same , " @entity2 said			1
" if the health care provider recommends a mammogram for a patient , they intend to cover that payment			1
" though the @entity28 is independent , the @entity3 ' web site calls the panel 's recommendations the " gold standard , " and insurance companies look to the panel for guidance on which preventive care practices they should cover			2
with the @entity70 administration fighting to push a sweeping overhaul of @entity73 health insurance through @entity74 , @entity68 quickly jumped at the chance to attack the mammography report			1
" this is how rationing begins , " said rep. @entity77 , @entity78			0
" this is the little toe in the edge of the water			0
and this is where you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician			0
" the @entity33 disputes that , saying the recommendations " can not be used to deny treatment " on their own			1
@entity2 said the task force wo n't make coverage decisions			2
" mammograms have been a huge step forward for millions of @entity73 women , but we still have about 21 million women and girls in @entity73 who do n't have a doctor , who do n't receive any kind of mammogram screening on any kind of basis regardless of their age , " she said			2
" the health reform debate is about closing that gap			0
" criticism of the recommendation has come from quarters other than opponents of the @entity114 health care bills			1
the @entity115 said it disagrees with the findings of the task force and continues to recommend annual screening , including mammograms , for all women beginning 40 and over			1
" with its new recommendations , the [ task force ] is essentially telling women that mammography at age 40 to 49 saves lives , just not enough of them , " said dr. @entity121 , the group 's chief medical officer			0
and rep. @entity128 , d - @entity129 , who was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer at 41 , called the panel 's recommendations " really disturbing " and " absolutely irresponsible			0
" " it 's a very patronizing attitude that these scientists have taken , " she said			0
" it 's pretty outrageous to suggest that women could n't handle more information			2
" rep. @entity138 , chairman of the @entity140 's @entity139 , has announced that he will lead hearings into the advisory board 's recommendations			1
@entity128 said those hearings " will help us reach the appropriate policy conclusion , which i believe is that these recommendations should be set aside			0
" breast cancer is the most common cancer for @entity73 women , with nearly 200,000 women expected to be diagnosed with the invasive form of the disease this year , according to the @entity115			0
for women 50 to 74 , it recommended routine mammography screenings every two years			2
risks and benefits for women age 75 and older are unknown , it said			0
while roughly 15 percent of women in their 40s detect breast cancer through mammography , data show that many other women experience false positives , anxiety , and unnecessary biopsies as a result of the test , according to the task force			2
the @entity28 reviews medical data and bases recommendations on effectiveness and risks involved			0
it is composed of 16 health care experts , none of whom are oncologists , though a team of cancer experts presented its findings to the group			1
@entity1 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
