-- the @entity1 has invited the @entity2 to @entity3 for @entity4 , or so the @entity6 newspaper headlines recently declared			1
oh , that it were true if only because @entity8 , royal reporter for @entity6 's @entity9 , tweeted that if @entity10 , the mother of @entity11 , the @entity12 , emerged alongside the @entity1 and drove to church , he 'd cartwheel naked down the path			1
lucky for @entity8 -- and dare i say even luckier for us -- it 's highly unlikely			0
invitations to @entity4 are never extended to the families of royal spouses and why should they be ? nothing personal , simply that @entity4 provides an opportunity for the @entity1 to enjoy quality time with her own immediate family with no expectation of being on parade			1
well , that and the issue of space			0
large as @entity3 might be , it is a house , not a castle			1
when the whole family is in attendance , there just is n't room for anyone else			0
the @entity37 has @entity4 down to a science , and the @entity1 's festive plans are as reliable as television airings of " it 's a @entity41 " and my inadvertently cooking the turkey upside down			1
it 's the same every year			0
since the fire at @entity46 in 1992 , the royal family has gathered to celebrate @entity4 at @entity3 , the @entity1 's privately - owned @entity47 estate			1
following arrivals on @entity50 , afternoon tea is served			0
the evening brings a fancy black - tie dinner , and the opening of presents -- a @entity56 tradition embraced by @entity57 when she married @entity58			2
after breakfast on christmas morning , it 's church , lunch , a huddle around the television to watch the @entity65 message to the nation , a country walk , and an evening of parlor games			0
it is an occasion steeped in familiar tradition and protocol for the @entity72 , but for the inexperienced newbie it 's enough to make you want to double - spike your eggnog			0
@entity3 is the @entity1 's house , and therefore as the @entity79 invitations are at her discretion			1
she has consistently been open to change and has adapted to the times accordingly			0
during her reign she has opened @entity84 to the public , made the royal finances more transparent , made walkabouts the norm , signed the @entity89 , and she was the first reigning monarch to visit the @entity90 since @entity92 independence			0
@entity4 , however , is one area where change is unlikely			1
the @entity1 is not obligated in any way to the extended families of either her children or her grandchildren			2
the @entity99 may well be the grandparents of the future king , but so too were @entity102 and @entity103 , yet that did n't see either of them swilling sherry and pulling crackers over the @entity1 's @entity4 goose			1
were the queen to invite the @entity10 family , it would in turn pave the way for other in - laws to attend			0
@entity115 's children have n't spent @entity4 with their mother since she married @entity117 in 2005			2
princesses @entity118 and @entity119 have n't celebrated @entity4 with their mum since their parents ' divorce in 1996			2
the list goes on and therein lies the quandary			0
invite the @entity126 , and suddenly @entity4 becomes a free - for - all " plus one			1
" last year , with the @entity1 's blessing , @entity128 and @entity12 chose to spend @entity4 with @entity12 's family in @entity131 , @entity132			1
while alternating families for the holidays is the standard festive headache for us regular folk , it was an unprecedented decision for the @entity3 lot			2
by doing something different @entity128 and @entity12 effectively changed the model of a royal family @entity4			1
the @entity1 and the @entity143 enjoy a relaxed relationship with @entity145 and @entity10			2
before the royal wedding the @entity1 asked them to lunch at @entity46			1
in june 2012 they were invited to sail on the @entity151 paddle steamer during the @entity152 , and they joined other members of the royal family in the @entity1 's official carriage procession to @entity157 in 2011 and 2012			1
she has already publicly embraced the @entity2 far more than she has the family of any other royal spouse			0
@entity128 and @entity12 are the new owners of @entity161 , a property on the @entity3 estate , but it is currently being renovated , so there 's no room at the inn for the @entity99 there			2
even if it were ready , i do n't see @entity128 and @entity12 leaving her family at home while they swan off to the " big house			0
" every family celebrates @entity4 in their own unique way , and the @entity99 would never presume to be included in the royals ' personal festivities , nor would the @entity1 , @entity143 , @entity117 and @entity115 expect to load the corgis and a fruitcake into the @entity181 and head down to @entity131			1
there is no slight , no malice , no scandal here , rather a wish to preserve the elements of sacred family @entity4			2
in that way , the royals are " just like us			0
" looks like @entity8 will be keeping his clothes on this year after all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

some newspapers *suggest* @entity1 will invite *middletons* to @entity3 for @entity4
@entity199 says such an offer would break with all royal traditions
@entity4 is one area where @entity1 is unlikely to break with tradition , she adds
