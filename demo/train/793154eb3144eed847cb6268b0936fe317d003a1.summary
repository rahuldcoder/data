monday 's announcement by @entity3 's prime minister acknowledging that missing @entity4 ended in the southern @entity5 opens the door to a big question : how did new number crunching confirm the @entity10 's path ? now we know for sure " there 's no way it went north , " said @entity13 vice president @entity12			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity17 said monday that the plane was last tracked over the middle of the @entity5 , west of @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity23 has informed passengers ' relatives that " all lives are lost , " a relative told @entity1			1
monday 's announcement brings new questions about the mystery that has captivated the planet for more than two weeks			2
it also provoked a call that all airliners be constantly tracked			1
the mathematics - based process used by @entity13 and the @entity36 's @entity35 ( @entity35 ) to reveal the definitive path was described by @entity12 as " groundbreaking			1
" " we 've done something new , " he said			0
here 's how the process works in a nutshell : @entity13 officials and engineers were able to determine whether the plane was flying away or toward the satellite 's location by expansion or compression of the satellite 's signal			1
what does expansion or compression mean ? you may have heard about something called the doppler effect			0
" if you sit at a train station and you listen to the train whistle -- the pitch of the whistle changes as it moves past			0
that 's exactly what we have , " explained @entity1 meteorologist @entity62 , who has studied doppler technology			2
" it 's the doppler effect that they 're using on this ping or handshake back from the airplane			2
they know by nanoseconds whether that signal was compressed a little -- or expanded -- by whether the plane was moving closer or away from 64.5 degrees -- which is the longitude of the orbiting satellite			2
" each ping was analyzed for its direction of travel , @entity62 said			0
the new calculations , @entity12 said , underwent a peer review process with space agency experts and contributions by @entity10			1
it 's possible to use this analysis to determine more specifically the area where the plane went down , @entity62 said			2
" using trigonometry , engineers are capable of finding angles of flight			0
" what could wreckage tell us about flight 370 's fate ? no surprise experts said they were n't surprised by the news that the flight traveled along the southern track -- one of two possible paths revealed by satellite data last week			1
the possible northern track toward @entity106 would have been heavily monitored by radar			0
@entity106 had said it found no evidence of flight 370 on its radar systems			0
" it was very difficult to believe that no watch captain " along the possible northern path " would 've seen a burning or distressed aircraft in the sky during the course of their watch , " said @entity12			0
is the more pinpointed flight path now focused enough to increase the chances of finding wreckage from the plane ? if the flight definitely ended far from land , does that support the theory that the plane was not hijacked ? it 's just one question of many that investigators likely will be pondering in the coming days			0
hours before the prime minister 's announcement , @entity21 officials said they had spotted two objects in the southern @entity5 that could be related to the flight , which has been missing since march 8			1
one object is " a gray or green circular object , " and the other is " an orange rectangular object , " the @entity137 said			0
" this is obviously a major tragedy , " @entity12 said			0
" the only thing you can hope is that from this , just as the @entity145 resulted in ( new safety legislation ) , that from this , there will be a mandate that all aircraft should be constantly tracked			1

satellite experts use " groundbreaking " process to track @entity4 's final hours
the @entity23 @entity10 's last position was " in the middle of the @entity5 , west of @entity20 "
satellite official : hopefully , this will trigger a " mandate that all aircraft should be constantly tracked "
