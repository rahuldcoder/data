-- when @entity3 , @entity4 , advertising executive @entity2 finished high school in the late 1990s , he made a vow			1
he swore he would " never , ever again " commute to work by car , " no matter what i was doing in life			2
" most of his teen friends were getting their first cars and feeling free , but @entity15 did n't see it like that			2
for him , freedom was being able to spend three hours a day doing something other than driving to and from private school			2
driving was " oppressive , " and his @entity22 felt like a " ball and chain			0
" flash - forward to the present			0
@entity15 , now 32 , either walks or rides the bus to his office every day , making his way to the back of the @entity34 bus , where he 'll find a window seat and maybe enjoy a nice book			2
" i feel more free when i take the bus , " @entity15 said			0
" i do n't have to worry about a car , where it 's parked , gas or maintenance			0
" he 's secure knowing that , just outside his door , " a bus is going to come by every 15 minutes and and take me where i want to go			0
" @entity15 represents a growing segment of @entity46 that has embraced public transit from coast to coast in communities like @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
and the numbers are bearing that out			0
statistics released monday from the @entity57 show that 2012 ranks as the second - highest transit ridership year since 1957			1
trips in 2012 on @entity46 subways , commuter trains , light rail , trolleys and buses beat the previous year by 1.5 % -- or about 154.3 million rides			1
that despite damage from one of the worst @entity70 storms in decades			0
last fall , @entity71 shut down some of @entity46 's largest transit systems , resulting , according to the transportation association , in a loss of an estimated 74 million trips			1
in @entity77 , the storm closed subways for several hours			1
the annual traffic increased 2.8 % despite a 25 % fare increase earlier in the year			2
nationwide , ridership still increased			2
what 's going on here ? well , several things , say experts			0
for one , the price of gas spiked north of $ 4 a gallon in 2008			0
that year , a lot of commuters who economized by using transit got a surprise : they liked it			2
they liked it because they could work on their laptops or phones			0
they could call friends , read books , chat with other commuters			0
it was all so much more enjoyable than crawling in rush - hour traffic on @entity107 's @entity106 , @entity109 's @entity108 or even in @entity3 at the intersection of @entity111 and @entity112			1
so they kept on riding , even as gas prices dropped			0
another reason : cities that did n't have many public transportation options in the ' 80s and ' 90s have been getting on board			2
places like @entity123 and @entity124 , which fostered rail transit during the past decade , are now seeing community benefits like lower traffic congestion and increased economic activity			1
the ballot box revealed another signal of support			0
last year , voters approved nearly 80 % of the nation 's local and state transit funding initiatives , the @entity57 said , allowing their tax money to go toward public transportation systems			1
some of the winners in monday 's public transit report include : @entity141 @entity140 subways , up 1.82 % @entity140 heavy rail , up 3.70 % @entity143 elevated trains , up 4.32 % @entity3 , @entity4 , buses , up 6.6 % @entity146 , @entity147 , overall , up 9 % @entity148 , @entity149 ( northwest of @entity51 ) , overall up by 11 % @entity52 , @entity150 , overall up 6.8 % @entity124 light rail , up 6.7 % @entity152 , @entity153 , overall up 8 % @entity50 , overall up 12 % @entity155 commuter rail up 14.74 % ; light rail up 14.73 % cities that reported fewer trips included : @entity160 subway , down 3.2 % @entity109 @entity162 subway / elevated rail , down 5.02 % riders as customers less than 5 years old , @entity124 's light rail line gained nearly 7 % in riders last year			1
experts credit the increase to the train 's convenient access to the city convention center , schools , shopping and nighttime entertainment			0
" we look at riders as customers and try to design the experience from a customer 's point of view , " said @entity177 's @entity176			0
a special phone number offers riders real - time updates on arrival times			0
managers are considering adding @entity187 to the trains			0
plans call for @entity124 light rail to expand to 57 miles by 2026 at the earliest , depending on the economy			1
linking up @entity155 @entity155 's young rail system showed a nearly 15 % gain on both its light rail and commuter rail lines in the @entity123 area			1
a commuter railroad linking the city with @entity199 opened in 2012 , helping commuters avoid annoying vehicle traffic on @entity202			2
@entity155 's light rail debuted in 2001 and commuter rail in 2008			1
this year , two more light rail lines are expected to open for business			1
lawmakers are considering using public transit to battle the region 's smog problem			1
a proposal would offer free access to light rail during january and july , @entity155 's worst months for smog			1
generations and something else : the shift to embrace public transit appears to have a generational component			1
younger people are waiting longer to get their driver 's licenses , studies show			2
many of these folks are using public transit			1
@entity226 , age 18 to 34 , like @entity15 are more likely to use public transit than older @entity46 , according to surveys			1
" our parents moved to ' burbs where we grew up riding around in cars , " @entity15 said			0
" my generation is going the other way			0
it may be as simple as that			0

new stats show rides on @entity46 subways , light rail , commuter rail , trolleys increased 1.5 %
@entity46 took 154.3 more rides on public transit in 2012 compared to 2011 , study says
big increases in @entity3 , @entity4 ; @entity52 ; @entity53 , @entity77 , @entity141
