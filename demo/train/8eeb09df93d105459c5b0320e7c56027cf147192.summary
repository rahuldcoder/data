@entity5 , meanwhile , moved up into fifth place on goal difference above a group of five teams including @entity22			1
@entity23 are also in that bunch on 24 points -- 11 behind @entity16 -- after drawing 3 - 3 at @entity26 , who are one point further back in 11th place			1
@entity1 were bundled out of the @entity29 after a 4 - 1 thrashing at home to @entity33 side @entity32 on tuesday which meant the @entity1 failed to get past the group stage of @entity36 's premier club competition			2
they will be able to concentrate on domestic glory now , but will need to bounce back quickly to avert a continued slump , having ended last week so well with a 2 - 1 win against @entity16			0
@entity5 took the lead in just the seventh minute as former @entity1 youth player @entity42 blocked a clearance on the edge of the area and then his shot deflected into the net off @entity48			0
@entity50 forward @entity49 equalized in the 23rd minute after @entity5 goalkeeper @entity51 could only block @entity53 's shot , but the hosts went ahead again just before halftime with a penalty from @entity57 , who was tripped by @entity59 defender @entity58			0
midfielder @entity60 sealed his former club 's fate with a long - range effort that eluded goalkeeper @entity64 in the 86th minute to give @entity5 their first win over @entity1 since 1990			2
@entity23 needed a last - gasp equalizer from @entity67 which came five minutes into time added on to deny @entity26 in @entity69			2
@entity70 and @entity71 had the visitors 2 - 0 up after 65 minutes , but @entity26 hit back with three goals in the final 15 minutes through @entity74 , @entity75 -- his seventh in successive games -- and @entity79 striker @entity78			0
however , @entity70 was sent off for kicking a ball at @entity26 coach @entity81 as tempers flared during injury - time , then @entity67 's header denied the home team a fifth successive win .			1
