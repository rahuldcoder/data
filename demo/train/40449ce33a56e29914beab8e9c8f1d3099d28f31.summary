-- no play can begin in a baseball game until the pitcher throws the ball			1
and no play can conclude until the umpire makes the call			0
" we 're not just robots they send out there , " umpire @entity8 ( 2nd from l ) told author @entity10			0
yet these figures -- the man on the mound and the men who stand in judgment -- are vastly different in importance to the average fan			0
there are countless children who dream of becoming a major - league pitcher			1
he is , literally , the king of the hill			0
umpires ? almost nobody dreams of becoming an umpire			1
and yet the positions share a number of similarities , according to two new books : " as they see ' @entity34 " ( @entity35 ) , by @entity36 writer @entity10 , and " the @entity37 " ( @entity38 ) , by former major - league pitcher ( and current @entity41 broadcaster ) @entity32			1
both jobs require a great deal of command , neither gets enough training , and both are often disrespected by others in the game			1
indeed , despite a library of books by and about pitchers ( @entity54 's " @entity53 , " @entity56 's " the @entity55 , " @entity58 's " pitching in a pinch " ) , @entity49 said he believes that people still do n't understand what it takes to stand on that mound			1
" within baseball circles there is a common baseball axiom , ' if pitchers were n't so stupid , hitters would never get a hit , ' " he said in an e-mail			1
" of course , i knew this was a fallacy so i decided to write about the travails of major league pitchers			0
throwing a ball 95 mph to tin cup - sized quadrants sounds pretty difficult to me , and i wanted to express this to the reader			1
" umpires , on the other hand , rarely get written about at all -- in fact , they 're often treated as less than human			1
( " the owners basically see them like bases , " former baseball commissioner @entity82 told @entity10			1
" they say , ' we need a base ; we need an umpire ; same thing			0
' " ) @entity10 found a fraternity ( and they are almost all men ) much like cops or soldiers : tight - lipped believers in baseball law and order			1
@entity10 immersed himself in the " land of umpires , " as the book 's subtitle calls it , attending umpiring school , calling games at various levels of pro ball and talking with those who were willing -- including the legendary @entity103 , who was called " @entity105 " for his imperious demeanor			1
what he found is that what looks so obvious on television at home is often a challenge on the field , a matter not just of eyesight but positioning , rule - book knowledge and basic guts			1
" that 's really what [ being an umpire ] is about -- is being in charge , " he said			1
" if there 's anything that characterizes the major league umpire , it 's that special kind of chutzpah			1
" umpires need that presence because they 're often baseball 's most disrespected men			1
aside from the vitriol they face -- the managers kicking dirt , the spectators yelling " kill the ump " -- they 're second - guessed by broadcasters and barely tolerated by management , as @entity10 reveals in detailing the episodes preceding and following the 1999 umpires ' strike			1
and yet @entity139 does n't participate in umpire training or development , entrusting it to two umpire - run private schools , @entity10 observes			2
( @entity139 does run an annual umpire camp			0
) @entity49 echoes @entity10 's concerns in his own field , pitching			2
in these days of strict pitch counts and injury concern , pitchers are " undertrain [ ed ] , " he says , noting that top draft choices climb the ranks " never allowed to throw more than 110 pitches			0
" that leaves them at a disadvantage when they have to go deeper into a game or cope with a tough inning , he says			0
" it would be like training for the marathon and never running more than 5 miles , " he says			0
" identifying and preserving million - dollar arms are [ the purview ] of doctors , not baseball people			1
" @entity49 's book is a chronicle of pitchers ' thought processes , using individual innings from his pitching or broadcasting career to make his point			2
he talks about panic overtaking a pitcher , as it did for @entity49 in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the @entity179 ; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a @entity182 game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever , a 1981 extra-inning contest that @entity49 's @entity188 lost to @entity190 's @entity189 , 1 - 0			1
he says he remembered the games vividly			0
" i definitely watched tapes and read box scores , but i was very clear on almost all the minutiae of the good old days			0
a little scary and maybe a major personality flaw ! " pitchers get more support than umpires , of course			2
@entity49 observes that the relationship between a pitcher and his catcher during a well - pitched game " is one of sport 's most beautiful dances			1
i would not have said it when i was playing , but after a shutout ... there is a love for that person immediately after the process			0
you did something together that could not have been done alone , and nobody can understand what you went through to get there			0
" umpires , too , take pride in their best moments , though few pay attention outside their fellow umpires			2
more common is to be vilified for missed calls			0
@entity10 devotes a moving passage in his book to a conversation with the retired @entity229 , a 29 - year veteran remembered by fans ( if he 's remembered at all ) for a wrong call in the @entity232			1
though time has dulled the pain , " i think he lives with [ that call ] every day , " @entity10 said			0
" when a dreadful thing happens to you in front of so many people and you become famous for it , it must be devastating			0
" @entity10 says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks			2
when watching games now , the @entity247 fan says , he 'll focus on the umpires			2
" i just think umpiring is interesting			0
people hate ' em , and they somehow perceive of umpiring as a flaw in the game , but i do n't , " he said			0
" now i 'm always interested who the umpires are			2
" which is a point the umpires would appreciate			2
" umpires are people , too , " veteran ump @entity8 told @entity10			2
" we have families ; we have emotions			0
... somebody says , ' kill the umpire , ' and people go , ' heh , heh , that 's funny , ' but in order to do that , you have to disassociate the umpire from the person			0
we 're not just robots they send out there			0

" as they see ' @entity34 " is in - depth look at baseball umpires
" the @entity37 , " by @entity41 broadcaster @entity32 , gets inside pitcher 's head
two positions have similarities : necessary command , some disrespect
