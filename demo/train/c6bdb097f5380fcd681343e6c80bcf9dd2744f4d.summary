-- there 's no replacing @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6 as the original " @entity7 , " but if you were staging a one - night - only live version of the classic comedy , well ... whom might one contact ? @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity13 are going to cross the streams			1
the event is one of the monthly live - reads of a famous movie script organized by " @entity18 " and " @entity21 " filmmaker @entity19 , who â € ” of course â € ” has a family connection to this story			1
his father , @entity24 , directed " ghostbusters " and he remembers hanging around on the set as a little kid			1
but even he was surprised when he went back and looked at the original script of the movie for thursday night 's reading at the @entity31 collect all 4 hobbit covers : when you subscribe to @entity0 ! it turns out , @entity4 was making it all up as he went along			1
" while almost all of the dialogue in original screenplay is echoed on screen , the @entity37 character is completely improvised			2
it 's as if @entity4 was given a mumblecore - style essay about each scene and then permitted to say whatever he wanted as long as he got the point across , " @entity19 tells @entity0			1
" he slimed me " is in the script , but not the follow - up line : " i feel so funky			0
" and remember @entity37 's magician act ? it 's not in the script			2
" he 's like a jazz musician who knows , ' i have eight measures here and have to hit this note here and as long as i follow those rules everything else is up to me , ' " @entity19 says			1
did that drive his father crazy ? @entity19 laughs and says : " this was his third movie with @entity64			1
they 'd made meatballs , and done stripes together			0
he was already familiar with those improvisation skills			0
" in creating the script for the @entity71 live - read this week , @entity19 's father got him the original script , as well as a transcription of the finished movie			1
he found himself adding many of the improvisations to the page , while still trying to preserve some of the original lines , which have never been heard before			2
" every important @entity37 line is back in there , and there are about 30 of those , " @entity19 says			1
" you ca n't have ghostbusters without ' we came , we saw , we kicked its ass			0
' " it 's not just the memorable one - liners that @entity4 added			2
" it 's the strange nuances , " @entity19 notes			1
" for example , @entity37 goes to meet [ @entity93 's ] @entity92 at @entity94 and she 's talking to a man			2
as he walks away , @entity37 goes , ' i 'm sorry you and i did n't get more of a chance to chat ! ' he expresses vulnerability and ego in a way that is kind of impossible to write			0
" that leads us to @entity19 's choices on the live event 's casting : @entity11 as @entity107 " it 's the most crucial and tricky piece of casting			1
i knew we needed an actor whose rhythms were equally unique to @entity4 's and had that kind of a swagger			0
" @entity12 as @entity114 " when you think about @entity5 as @entity114 , you think about this positive enthusiasm and energy			1
no one has that like @entity12			1
" @entity13 as @entity119 " as originated by @entity6 , this part needs someone with an earnest , scientific mind and clear - cut decisive humor			1
" the role of @entity126 , originated by @entity127 , will be played by comedian and voice actor @entity129 , best known for the role of @entity131 in " @entity132			0
" ( yeah , poor , shot - in - the - face @entity131			0
) @entity93 's role of @entity134 , a.k.a. @entity135 will be played by @entity136 , while @entity137 will play both the mayor of @entity139 and the fussy @entity141 idiot @entity143 " this man has no dâ € ” k " @entity142			0
" @entity146 and @entity147 both lent their voices to the original film , and @entity137 does great impressions of both of them , " @entity19 adds			1
@entity154 of @entity155 will take over the role of the " ghostbusters ' " receptionist @entity158 , originated by @entity159 , while @entity160 ( @entity161 , @entity162 ) will perform the @entity164 part of louis " @entity165			0
@entity166 will fill out the rest of the cast with such roles as the guy taking the psychic test at the beginning of the film -- and being mercilessly electrocuted by @entity37			0
@entity19 has previously staged @entity173 live - reads of " @entity174 , " " @entity175 , " " @entity176 " and " @entity177 , " but this is the first time he has done one of his father 's films			1
" it was a part of my life growing up			0
i just thought it would be fun , " the younger @entity19 says			2
" i have one of the original ghostbuster guns in my house			0
that is the one thing they want to see , and want to take a photo with			0
i understand the energy around that film			0
to me it 's similar to @entity175 live - read we did last year			1
people have a relationship with the film that goes beyond normal movies			0
" the live - reads always sell out long before the film is even announced , but there is usually a wait - list outside and some people get lucky			2
