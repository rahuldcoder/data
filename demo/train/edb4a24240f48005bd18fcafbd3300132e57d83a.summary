@entity0 , @entity1 -- for the last 15 years , @entity3 has been trying to find the truth about her infertility			1
after her third child was born dead , the 49 - year - old leadership skills instructor who lives in @entity0 , the @entity1 capital , was never able to conceive again			1
three months after losing her child , a doctor confirmed her worst fears : her tubes had been tied without her knowledge or consent			0
my rights as a mother and woman were violated , " @entity16 said			2
@entity16 is not the only woman in @entity1 who was sterilized in the nineties during the government of president @entity23			1
human rights organizations say there are more than 2,000 documented cases of women who had their tubes tied without their consent			2
nobody really knows how many women were forcibly sterilized throughout @entity1 , but @entity32 , the special prosecutor who reopened the investigation in october , says that the number is in the thousands			1
" the @entity1 attorney general 's office has knowledge of about 2,000 women ( in this situation ) , but cases of forced sterilization based on the number of people ( who participated in the campaign ) could undoubtedly be larger at the national level			1
there are many women who i 'm sure have n't reported this and therefore their cases are not yet documented , " @entity32 said			2
all inquiries about the sterilizations were shelved in 2009 and it was not until late october when @entity32 was tapped to reopen the investigation by the new government of president @entity55			1
@entity56 , a human rights attorney at @entity57 , a women 's rights organization in @entity1 , also says there could be many more cases			1
" what happened was that [ the government ] instituted a policy of quotas , in a way forcing and giving incentives to doctors , gynecologists and nurses to sterilize a minimum of three women every month , " @entity56 says			2
both government officials and human rights organizations agree that about 300,000 women throughout @entity1 participated in a birth control campaign during the nineties			1
the campaign involved several methods including what @entity1 officials call " voluntary contraceptive surgery " or tying of the @entity82			1
but @entity56 says that this particular method was used in women in rural @entity1 , especially those who spoke no @entity86 , without their knowledge and sometimes by force			1
in a documentary made by the @entity92 and @entity91 for the @entity93 several women testify that they were sterilized by force or coerced			1
in her native @entity97 tongue , an unidentified woman says she was taken by force to a clinic where she was sterilized in spite of her objections			2
another woman says she and her husband were coerced to sign a consent form for sterilization			0
@entity106 was the @entity1 health minister between 1996 and 1998			1
he denied any wrongdoing when he testified before the @entity108 in the late nineties			0
and he denied it again , in a recent interview at his @entity0 office			0
but @entity106 admits the campaign could 've been have been executed better			0
" of course there were problems , " @entity106 said			0
" i 'm not going to deny it			0
i have never denied that there were problems			0
but what did we do about it ? first , we investigated all of the accusations that were filed ; absolutely all of them without exception			0
" @entity106 categorically denies that the government was targeting poor , indigenous women in rural communities			2
" there was never any order or instruction from my office favoring one method over another ; much less did we ever provide incentives for that to happen , " the former health minister said			0
so far @entity3 is the only woman in @entity1 that has won a case of forced sterilization			1
after a seven - year trial , she was compensated $ 2,750 , but her doctor did n't serve time in prison			0
she 's now trying to prove that her doctor was acting on government orders and that it was all part of a campaign to deceive women , especially the most vulnerable			2
" as a woman , i feel indignant and that 's why 15 years ago i said no woman should remain silent when her body has been violated , " @entity16 said			0
it has been more than a decade since those believed to be responsible for the forced sterilizations left office			0
for women like @entity3 , the reopening of the probe is the first hope in years that justice may be within reach .			0

nobody really knows how many women were forcibly sterilized throughout @entity1
the investigation was reopened in october
" i felt mutilated , " said a mother who has won a court case
