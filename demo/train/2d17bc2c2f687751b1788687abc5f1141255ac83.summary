@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 said tuesday that it would work to ban the sale of some mouse and rat poisons in a bid to better protect children and pets			1

among the targets are such popular rodent poisons as @entity21 , @entity22 and hot shot , the agency said			1

" today 's action will help keep our children and pets safe from these poisons			0
" the @entity2 said that as many as 15,000 children under the age of 6 are exposed to rat and mouse poisons each year			1
children are especially at risk , the agency said , because poisons are often put on the floor and kids will sometimes put bait pellets in their mouths			2
the sales ban would cover most loose bait and pellet products , the agency said			0
the @entity2 also intends to ban the residential sale of poisons that contain certain compounds -- brodifacoum , bromadiolone , difethialone and difenacoum -- because of their toxicity			0
