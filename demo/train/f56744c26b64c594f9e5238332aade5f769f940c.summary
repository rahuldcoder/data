-- once upon a time , the idea of having a trained , disciplined , cultivated memory was not nearly so strange a notion as it might seem to be today			1
people invested in their memories , in laboriously furnishing their minds			2
over the last few millennia , we 've invented a series of technologies -- from the alphabet to the printed book to the photograph to the @entity14 -- that have made it easier and easier for us to externalize our memories and essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity			2
these technologies have made our modern world possible , but they 've also changed us			2
they 've changed us culturally , and i would argue that they 've changed us cognitively			2
having little need to remember anymore , it sometimes seems as if we 've forgotten how			1
one of the last places where you still find people passionate about the idea of a disciplined , cultivated memory is a strange contest held each spring in @entity31 called the @entity32			1
contestants compete to see who can memorize the most lines of poetry , the most names of strangers , even the most random digits in five minutes			2
watch @entity41 's @entity40 the sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race			2
each year someone comes up with a new technique to remember more stuff more quickly , forcing the rest of the field to play catch up			1
three - time world memory champion @entity51 invented a memory system , which he alone has mastered , that allowed him to memorize the precise order of 28 shuffled packs of playing cards in one hour			0
he used a similar trick to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits in half an hour			0
even more incredible than the mere fact of this feat is that this is not an innate talent , but rather a skill he taught himself			1
@entity40 : how your brain tells you where you are while there are lots of different tricks for remembering better , all of the techniques used in these memory contests ultimately come down to a concept that psychologists refer to as elaborative encoding			0
and it 's well illustrated by a strange kind of forgetfulness that psychologists have dubbed the " @entity80			0
" the paradox goes like this : a researcher shows two people the same photograph of a face and tells one of them that the guy is a baker and the other that his last name is @entity91			0
a couple of days later , the researcher shows the same two subjects the same photograph and asks for the accompanying word			1
the person who was told the man 's profession is much more likely to remember it than the person who was given his surname			1
why should that be ? same photograph			0
@entity40 : the real reason for brains when you hear that the man in the photo is a baker , that fact gets embedded in a whole network of ideas about what it means to be a baker : he cooks bread , he wears a big white hat , he smells good when he comes home from work			1
the name @entity91 , on the other hand , is tethered only to a memory of the person 's face			0
that link is tenuous , and should it dissolve , the name will float off irretrievably into the netherworld of lost memories			0
( when a word feels like it 's stuck on the tip of the tongue , it 's likely because we 're accessing only part of the neural network that " contains " the idea , but not all of it			1
) but when it comes to the man 's profession , there are multiple strings to reel the memory back in			0
even if you do n't at first remember that the man is a baker , perhaps you get some vague sense of breadiness about him , or see some association between his face and a big white hat , or maybe you conjure up a memory of your own neighborhood bakery			1
there are any number of knots in that tangle of associations that can be traced back to his profession			0
@entity40 : a computer that works like the brain as i describe in my book " @entity173 " , the art of remembering better in memory competition -- and to remembering better in everyday life -- is about figuring out how to turn capital " @entity171 into lowercase " b " bakers			0
it 's about taking information that is lacking in context , lacking in meaning and figuring out a way to transform it so that it makes sense in the light of all the other things that you have floating around in your mind			1
@entity51 uses a complicated technique to memorize decks of playing cards and strings of binary digits , but we can all take advantage of the @entity80			0
if you want to make something memorable , you first have to make it meaningful			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity41 .			0

@entity197 observed the 2005 @entity32 and *won* it in 2006
he says you can teach yourself to remember a lot of information *effectively*
one of the keys is to associate a word or a fact with other things you remember , @entity197 says
@entity197 : " if you want to make something memorable , you first have to make it meaningful "
