-- @entity1 says bigotry , fear of change and a determination to personally destroy president @entity6 have paralyzed the @entity8 government			1
women and young people are the answer to fixing the gridlock that has partially shut down @entity14 , the actor told @entity0 on tuesday			1
" give them the reins , " @entity1 said			2
" i think they can do better than we have			0
" @entity1 , 77 , sat down with @entity0 's @entity19 to talk about his new film , " @entity23 , " which he agreed could serve as an analogy to the shutdown crisis			1
in the movie , @entity1 plays a lone sailor struggling to stay alive after his sailboat is crippled by a collision with a container ship			1
" at a certain point , i think , when things really get awful , when things get really bad and all seems to be lost -- there 's no hope , there 's no possibility -- then a lot of people quit , " @entity1 said about his character			1
" they say , ' what 's the point ? ' and they quit			2
and others keep going for no other reason than that			0
" opinion : men dither while women lead @entity1 : ' why are these people behaving so stupidly ? ' the conversation then turned to the drama playing out in @entity14 , where a standoff between @entity6 and @entity52 in @entity53 has forced the federal government into a partial shutdown and threatened a default on the @entity8 debt			1
" it 's so divided now with the people that are so narrow and so limited that they would take us back into the past , " @entity1 said			1
" and i was trying to figure out , why are these people behaving so stupidly ? why are they behaving so horribly that it 's crippling our whole country ? " and i think it has to do with fear			1
i think it 's a group of people that are so afraid of change , and they 're so narrow - minded that some people -- when they see change coming -- get so threatened by change , they get angry and they get terrorized , and then they get vicious			2
i think that 's who these people are			2
they 're so afraid of change that they 're behaving miserably			0
" @entity6 is " a compassionate man who ca n't function " in this political environment , @entity1 said			1
it " is so decrepit , it is so paralyzed , and the worst of it is it is paralyzed by intention , " he said			0
" there is a body of congressional people that wants to paralyze the system			0
i think what sits underneath it , unfortunately , is there 's probably some racism involved , which is really awful			2
" @entity6 's opponents reject whatever he might propose " because their determination was to destroy this person , " @entity1 said			1
" they wanted , if it meant destroying the government , anything to keep him from succeeding			0
" i think just the idea of giving credit to this president , giving him credit for anything , is abhorrent to them , so they 'll go against it			2
never mind that it 's the better good of the people , never mind that they 're supposed to be in office representing the interest of the public			0
they 're representing their own self - interests , which is very narrow and in some cases bigoted			0
" @entity8 's problem : we 're too dumb @entity1 : all is not lost but , unlike his latest film title , all is not lost , @entity1 said			1
he said " something new " is starting to happen that offers hope			0
" @entity126 , who is a @entity52 , is saying : ' enough of this			0
this is not the job i signed up for			0
i 've got to do something , ' " said @entity1 , referring to the @entity8 senator from @entity131			2
" so she 's bringing a bipartisan group together of women			0
i think the future should belong more to women and young people			0
" women must save the country " because a lot of men that were in control were behaving stupidly , " @entity1 said			1
" i mean , sometimes you say : ' can we actually be this dumbed down , or am i actually hearing what i 'm hearing from some of these people ? are they really , is that really happening ? ' it 's sad			0
" does this mean @entity1 is already throwing his support behind @entity154 in a 2016 @entity156 bid ? " no , i would n't single out one woman over another , " he said			1
" i think it 's time to give more women a chance			0
" " @entity23 , " which is almost a silent movie , with its sparse dialogue , hits @entity8 theaters next week			2
