-- a @entity6 juror 's laudatory @entity4 message to a medical examiner during a murder trial could nullify the jury 's conviction of @entity11 , the state 's @entity1 ruled wednesday			1
the high court did not immediately throw out the first - degree murder conviction of @entity11 , who was sentenced to life in prison in 2010			1
but in concluding the trial judge erred upon learning of the juror 's social networking communication with a key prosecution witness , state justices unanimously decided a new trial may be necessary unless the state proves the juror should n't have been disqualified			1
" if , for any reason , the trial court is unable to conduct a full and fair hearing with regard to juror ( @entity34 's improper extrajudicial communication with dr. @entity35 , then the trial court shall grant @entity36 a new trial , " the @entity1 ruled , referring to the juror by name , as well as dr. @entity26 , the medical examiner who testified			1
the @entity40 , @entity6 , @entity39 's @entity38 did not have an immediate reaction wednesday to the ruling			0
@entity11 's public defender declined to comment			1
a county grand jury indicted @entity11 in the death of @entity47 , whose body was found june 4 , 2007 , off a @entity50 road along with two .9 millimeter shell casings			2
the two had been living together , according to court documents			0
@entity11 went on trial in march 2010			1
after the jury was set , jurors were told by the judge they " should not talk with any witnesses , defendants or attorneys involved in this case			0
" testimony followed , including from @entity11 's cousin , who said the defendant told her a pistol " went off " while he and @entity47 were arguing and again when @entity11 was trying to move @entity47 's body			1
the prosecution also presented evidence indicating @entity47 's blood was in an automobile driven by @entity11 and owned by his father			1
the second - to - last person to testify for the prosecution was @entity35 , a @entity74 - trained assistant medical examiner			0
she conducted an autopsy on @entity47 and classified her death as a homicide , saying @entity47 was shot in the chest and the back of the head			0
the next day , about an hour after the jury began deliberating on @entity11 's fate , @entity35 e-mailed presiding judge @entity83 that she had been contacted via @entity4 by a juror who was an acquaintance			1
" @entity85 ! ! " the juror wrote , according to the e-mail included in the state @entity1 ruling			0
" i thought you did a great job today on the witness stand			0
... i was in the jury ... not sure if you recognized me or not ! ! you really explained things so great ! ! " @entity35 responded by saying she thought she recognized the juror , then warned of " a risk of a mistrial if that gets out			0
" the juror wrote back that he was aware of the risk , saying he had n't mentioned he knew @entity35			2
the first time the juror - witness communication came up in official court proceedings was after the verdict was delivered , but before sentencing			2
that 's when public defender @entity106 asked if the court asked the juror about the exchange , to which the judge replied , " no , i 'm satisfied with the communication that i have gotten with dr. @entity35 with regard to this matter			1
" @entity11 later asked for a new trial , in part because the defense was n't allowed to question the juror			1
the trial court ruled against him , as did a state appeals court that characterized the @entity4 communication as " mere interactions " and noted it is up to the court to decide if a juror is impartial			2
the @entity123 's ruling on wednesday overruled those decisions			2
stressing that " the public 's confidence in the fairness of the system " requires that all jurors be held " accountable to the highest standards of conduct , " the justices said the trial court should have taken " steps to assure that the juror has not been exposed to extraneous information or has not been improperly influenced			1
" in @entity11 's trial , this could have been addressed at a hearing at that time or a " full - scale investigation , " the court said			1
neither occurred , leading the state @entity1 to send the case back to the trial court for a hearing on the @entity4 communication and the jurors ' impartiality			2
conversations between jurors and people involved in a case have long been forbidden in state law			0
but the court admits that technology -- including the @entity155 , which allows jurors to conduct research and more readily communicate -- has complicated matters			0
" even though technology has made it easier for jurors to communicate with third parties and has made these communications more difficult to detect , our pre-internet precedents provide appropriate ( guidelines ) , " the ruling states			0
the state court also said trial courts need to " give jurors specific , understandable instructions that prohibit extrajudicial communications with third parties and the use of technology to obtain facts that have not been presented as evidence			0
" " trial courts should clearly prohibit jurors ' use of devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to access social media websites or applications to discuss , communicate , or research anything about the trial , " the court said			0
@entity0 's @entity183 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 went on trial in 2010 for first - degree murder
a doctor who did the victim 's autopsy testified , then was contacted by a juror
the trial judge did n't order a hearing into that interaction ; high court says he erred
@entity123 orders such a hearing , which could lead to a new trial
