experienced in running drug , prostitution and gambling rings , crime groups of various ethnicities and nationalities are learning it 's safer and potentially more profitable to file fraudulent claims with the federal @entity4 program and state - run @entity5 plans			1
" they 're hitting us and hitting us hard , " said @entity16 , head of investigations for the @entity18 at the @entity19			0
" organized crime involvement in health care fraud is widespread			1
" one hot spot for health care fraud is @entity26 , @entity27 , where @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 gangs have been caught by federal agents			1

the two , allegedly members of an organized crime ring , entered pleas of not guilty and are being held in a federal detention center			0
" they deny any allegations of wrongdoing , " said their attorney , @entity51			0
defrauding government - run health care programs involves stealing two types of identities : those of doctors , who bill for services , and patients , whose beneficiary numbers entitle them to medical care and necessary equipment			1
criminals are expert at collecting both			0
watch doctor tell what happened when his identity was stolen " that information is very , very valuable to these crooks			1
and the doctor may work at one clinic but he wo n't know about the second and third clinic that they 've already set up using his identification , " said @entity73 , special agent in charge of the @entity26 region for the @entity76			2
" they are definitely well - organized , well - schooled on how to commit @entity4 fraud			1
" dr. @entity84 had his identity stolen when he was recruited to join what appeared to be a new medical practice near @entity87 in @entity26			2
after the managers failed to show a business license and proof of malpractice insurance , @entity84 pulled out			0

" a jury found @entity99 guilty of using @entity84 's identification to bill @entity4 for medically unnecessary durable medical equipment			1
" i was naive enough to provide them my medical license , my other data , " said @entity84			0
patient beneficiary numbers are easy to buy along @entity26 ' @entity106			2
impoverished residents of shelters there tell @entity0 they 've accepted cash from recruiters -- known as " cappers " -- to go to bogus medical clinics where they share what they call their " red , white and blue " -- the tri-colored medicare card that has a beneficiary number for billing the government			1
" people down here need to eat			0
somebody who comes up on a quick hustle , quick money , they going to jump on			0
i 'm one of them , i will , " said a man who identified himself as @entity125			0
" they 're just defrauding the patients , defrauding the government			2
" @entity130 of @entity131 , @entity27 , tells @entity0 he went to a clinic three times a week , receiving $ 100 per visit but little medical care			2
" this is just like @entity137 , " said @entity130 , holding his @entity4 card			2
" matter of fact , better than @entity137			0
@entity137 has limitations on it			0
" the clinics , he concedes , were clearly fronts for collecting beneficiary data			0

" once criminals have doctor and patient identification numbers , they begin filing false claims			1
the @entity36 gang told @entity4 that health services were being provided on the 10th floor at 754 south @entity163			2
but there is no doctor 's office in that decrepit industrial building -- only a mail drop , where the @entity36 group collected checks from the @entity171 government for hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
the inspector general 's office of the @entity19 estimates it is on track to recover about $ 4 billion this year by breaking up health care fraud schemes perpetrated by all types of criminals , from organized rings to corrupt doctors			1
that amount , though , is only about 5 percent of the annual health care fraud cost in the @entity171 , according to the @entity182			1
because government health programs operate on the honor system , law enforcement officials say it 's easy for organized crime rings and average criminals to cash in at the taxpayer 's expense .			2

gangs make millions by getting @entity194 numbers of doctors , patients
then they file fraudulent @entity4 , @entity5 claims for care that never happened
one doctor had his id stolen , learned it was used to bill $ 800,000 for wheelchairs
government to recover $ 4 billion this year -- but that 's just 5 percent of fraud cost
