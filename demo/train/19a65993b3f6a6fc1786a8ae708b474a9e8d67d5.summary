-- twenty - five years ago , nearly to the day , i arrived at @entity2 with my wife of six months to become the first rabbi in residence in decades			0
i had just turned 22			0
my mandate was simple : deepen @entity8 identity among the @entity8 students and cultivate values - based leadership among the students at large			0
what i never expected to be my mission , but what eventually became central to everything i did , was defending @entity17 against ferocious and unjust assault			1
i quickly discovered that universities in general , and elite universities in particular , are breeding grounds for anti-israel bias			0
we beat back many attempts over 11 years to slander @entity17 as an expansionist , neo-colonialist power and succeeded in portraying the true nature of the @entity29 's only democracy			1
we hosted six @entity17 prime ministers and countless other eloquent defenders of the jewish state			1
but since i returned to the @entity35 , the situation among academics has only become worse			1
just after @entity37 's @entity36 compared @entity17 to @entity38 , we have the @entity39 , comprising about 5,000 academics , voting to boycott @entity17 academic institutions			1
the group is refusing all collaborations with universities , although not individual scholars			0
the reason , members say , is @entity17 's human rights abuses against @entity49 and the occupation			1
opposing view : boycott a sting to @entity17 apartheid the @entity39 has not boycotted any other country in a similar way			1
not , say , @entity56 , which regularly jails political dissidents for lengthy sentences and commits them to near - slave labor without any judicial process			0
@entity61 , who won the @entity62 , is serving an 11 - year sentence on fraudulent subversion charges			0
his wife , @entity65 , has been held incommunicado under house arrest for three years even though she has never been charged			0
so why would @entity17 , a thriving liberal democracy that guarantees the right of due process to all of its citizens , including minorities , be singled out ? if you argue that the reason is @entity17 's " occupation " of @entity77 lands , the @entity39 is surely aware of @entity56 's brutal occupation of @entity79 since 1950			1
@entity56 faces no existential threat			0
it does not have terrorists blowing up schools and buses and does not have a neighbor building a nuclear bomb threatening to annihilate it			0
@entity17 , by contrast , has all of these things			2
@entity17 has been under the threat of extermination by its @entity77 neighbors for six decades , has lost countless citizens to terrorism and has a nuclear - inclined @entity94 threatening to wipe it off the map			2
surely a group of scholars would understand the unique security situation facing a nation that has suffered a genocide of 6 million people just 70 years ago			2
so why @entity17 ? according to an article in the @entity104 , @entity39 president @entity102 said that his group singled out @entity17 , knowing that many of @entity17 's neighbors have worse human rights abuses , because " one has to start somewhere			1
" at @entity2 , i had the privilege of hosting and debating some of the world 's leading intellectuals			0
never before have i read a more inane quote from a man claiming to be a scholar			0
that 's your reason ? one has to start somewhere and that somewhere just happens to be , yet again , the @entity8 ? if it 's a matter of choosing a place to start , you could draw straws or perhaps throw dice or pull names from a hat			0
so , a group of academics just decided it was time to boycott some country and decided , arbitrarily , that @entity17 was as good as any ? this is n't even a case of @entity131 so much as buffoonery , not a case of prejudice so much as stupidity			1
let 's state the real facts			0
@entity17 is the @entity29 's only democracy , guaranteeing a free press and the right to worship , as well as the rights of women and homosexuals			1
although the @entity77 nations that surround @entity17 commit unspeakable human rights violations every day , @entity17 struggles under existential threat to balance its security needs with the freedoms it cherishes			1
the 1995 interim agreement says , " @entity17 and [ the @entity150 ] will ensure that their respective educational systems contribute to the peace between the @entity17 and @entity150 peoples			2
" yet @entity150 schools teach hatred of @entity17			2
a @entity35 government report finds that 84 % of the references to @entity17 in @entity150 textbooks are negative			1
in 2007 , the @entity162 reported in an article called " @entity167 " that university campuses are full of @entity166 propaganda			0
@entity17 has roadblocks and builds fences solely because it got tired of seeing its citizens blown to smithereens			2
calling for an academic boycott of @entity17 for the steps it takes to defend itself is akin to calling for an academic boycott of @entity175 and the @entity35 during @entity176 and , mind you , @entity17 has never even come close to indiscriminately bombing civilian population centers the way the allies did in that war			1
@entity17 takes great care to protect the lives of innocent civilians even as it fights genocidal terror organizations @entity166 and @entity187			2
we @entity35 who cherish freedom , democracy and liberty should be ashamed that a group of our nation 's " scholars " have so viciously maligned a most humane nation			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			0

@entity39 voted to boycott @entity17 academic institutions
@entity198 : with all the nations that are extreme human rights violators , why @entity17 ?
he says @entity17 is a thriving democracy that guarantees the right of due process to all
*boteach* : @entity35 should be ashamed that " scholars " have maligned a humane nation
