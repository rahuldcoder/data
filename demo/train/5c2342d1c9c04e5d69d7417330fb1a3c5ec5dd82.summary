despite the conventional wisdom that @entity2 is a frozen island of partisanship , a hopeful thaw is underway			2
for the past year , we have been spearheading a bipartisan effort to update the process of discovering , developing and delivering medical therapies to help people live longer and better lives			1
after months of listening to experts and stakeholders , the path to faster cures is clearer than ever			1
we call it the @entity18 initiative , and @entity19 is about to take a major leap down this road of hope			1
there are over 7,000 diseases yet we only have cures and treatments for 500 of them			1
this unacceptable fact led to one simple question : what policies can we enact to help get more cures and treatments to patients ? our review revealed several areas of reform that will close the gap between the science of medicine and the regulations that impact the volume and fate of new therapies			1
our legislation will modernize all of these categories , removing outdated hurdles that can prevent innovation from flourishing or from fleeing the @entity49			2
first , we must modernize clinical trials to streamline the approval of drugs and devices			0
safety has and always will be a top priority			0
but the old approach of automatically applying a therapy to a broad group of patients is no longer the best path forward , particularly for those diseases for which we do not have a treatment or cure			1
technologies like genetic screening can help us target the right treatments to the right group of patients , creating opportunities for smaller , more targeted and effective trials			1
we will also streamline the paperwork associated with conducting scientific investigations , whether it 's making it easier to recruit patients for clinical trials or adapting the operation of trials as we learn new information			0
second , we will better integrate the patient perspective into the regulatory process			0
building off of the @entity79 's @entity78 ( @entity81 ) program , we are looking at ways to help strengthen @entity79 's efforts to further incorporate the patient 's perspective			0
new public - private partnerships that can help build the science around biomarkers and patient - reported outcomes are one way to produce more collaboration , move toward faster cures and better involve patients			1
we also will create a predictable process for the qualification of biomarkers and patient - reported outcomes so we can utilize these tools in the development process			0
third , we must promote better access to and sharing of information such as genomic and other clinical data to foster more collaboration among researchers			0
we will also assist developers and entrepreneurs building innovative , patient - focused technologies by removing regulatory uncertainty as they build apps and other new products			0
with the explosion of technology , we can collect , monitor and analyze information like never before , helping patients stay healthy and adopt healthy habits while also making treatments safer and more effective			1
finally , fostering better interoperability and the collection and secure sharing of data for research are other critical components to modernizing the development of treatments			2
fourth , we will invest in the future of science			0
our legislation will help young , emerging scientists with expanded access to resources and will take steps to ensure federal dollars are invested wisely			0
many of our most promising investigators -- many with great ideas and cutting edge training -- are hamstrung by the challenges of securing much - needed support			0
we will encourage them to conduct research here in the @entity49 , creating jobs and ensuring that patients here at home have access to the most innovative , new treatments			2
finally , we will better incentivize new drugs and devices for unmet medical needs			0
this includes streamlining the premarket process while establishing mechanisms to better capture real world evidence post-market			0
we can also examine incentives , such as exclusivity or simplifying the reimbursement process , to produce drugs and devices for diseases with unmet needs			2
@entity49 has a strong history of finding solutions to diseases through medical innovation			1
today , partnerships with patients and advocates , health care workers and researchers , and government and the private sector can speed the cycle of finding faster cures			1
given the rate of recent scientific progress , it 's time to modernize policy to move the process of discovery , development and delivery even faster			2
the 21st century cures initiative is a bipartisan effort to melt @entity2 's polarization and do just that .			1

there are over 7,000 diseases yet we only have cures and treatments for 500 of them
the 21st @entity18 initiative is a bipartisan bill to speed the cycle for finding faster cures
