meanwhile , @entity1 's @entity33 described the move as a justified enforcement of the country 's air defense zone			2
@entity15 defense minister @entity38 said it was the closest that @entity1 jets had come to @entity15 aircraft -- passing about 30 meters from one plane and 50 meters from another			1

tensions in recent years over @entity1 's increasingly assertive stance towards territorial claims escalated in november when it unilaterally declared an " air defense identification zone , " or @entity85 , that included stretches of disputed territory			2
