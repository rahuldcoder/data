super-middleweight champion after out - pointing @entity5 @entity4 in a bruising encounter in his native @entity7 on saturday night			1
despite being previously unbeaten after 26 fights , the 32 - year - old @entity4 never looked comfortable against his durable opponent , who was given the decision on all three of the judges scorecards after 12 brutal rounds in front of a partisan and passionate crowd at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
@entity4 had @entity1 on the canvas in the fifth round , but the referee ruled that the @entity20 had slipped , and the challenger eventually wore the champion down with a combination of hooks and jabs to take the belt by a margin of 117 - 111 , 115 - 113 and 116 - 112			2
the result means 31 - year - old @entity1 , who has lost just twice in 45 fights , is a world champion again just five months after losing his @entity31 ( @entity31 ) title to @entity32			2
although gracious in defeat , @entity4 questioned if the decision would have gone @entity1 's way if the fight had taken place in his hometown of @entity39 , @entity40			1
" i feel terrible that i lost my title , absolutely gutted , " @entity4 told ringside reporters after the fight			0
" i do n't want to make a mockery of anything but i feel if it was at home in my town , the decision would have gone the other way			0
" he added : " i took some big punches off a big puncher and i 've got to give @entity1 the credit he deserves			0
he stayed in there and is a strong , proud warrior			0
