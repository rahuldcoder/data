-- @entity2 presidential candidate @entity1 wants the current head of world football @entity4 to be included in the organization 's investigation into bribery			1
@entity1 , who is the sole challenger to @entity4 in presidential elections scheduled for june 1 , is due to be quizzed by @entity2 's ethics committee this weekend along with @entity11 , who runs the @entity13 federation covering @entity14 and @entity15			1
the pair have been accused of bribery by @entity2 executive committee member @entity18 in relation to a meeting the two held with the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) on may 10 and 11 this year			1
@entity1 , who is head of the @entity22 , denied any wrongdoing and has now demanded @entity4 be included in the probe after claiming he was also named in evidence handed to the ethics committee			1
@entity2 probes fresh bribery scandal a statement sent to @entity0 by the @entity32 read : " @entity1 , member of the executive committee of @entity2 , was surprised by yesterday 's accusations of bribery			1
he rejects these accusations and confirms that they are without substance			0
" the accusations also contain statements according to which mr. @entity4 , the incumbent @entity2 president , was informed of , but did not oppose , payments allegedly made to members of the @entity21			1
" mr. @entity1 has therefore requested that the investigation by the @entity43 be extended to include mr. @entity4 himself			2
" the timing of the accusations so close to the election of @entity2 president on june 1 suggests that they are part of a plan to damage mr. @entity1 and force him to withdraw as a candidate for the @entity2 presidency			2
'' @entity1 added : " i am not at all afraid to answer any questions that the @entity43 may have for me at the hearing next sunday			0
as long as the committee guarantees a fair process , i have nothing to fear			0
" @entity11 has also been named in allegations made by @entity59 , the former head of @entity62 's 2018 @entity61 bid , who claimed he was asked to provide money to the @entity64 in exchange for his vote			2
meanwhile , @entity4 has insisted he " takes no joy " in seeing his election rival being hauled before the ethics committee , and rejected the idea he had anything to do with the situation			2
writing for the @entity74 website he said : " to make a point very clear , let me say this : i take no joy in having to observe yet another ethics committee hearing and investigation			0
and i take absolutely no joy in seeing my friends and colleagues of many years dragged before the ethics committee			0
" i take no joy to see men who stood by my side for some two decades suffer through public humiliation without having been convicted of any wrongdoing : nobody is guilty until a judge has found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt			0
" to now assume that the present ordeal of my opponent were to fill me with some sort of perverse satisfaction or that this entire matter was somehow masterminded by me is ludicrous and completely reprehensible			0
