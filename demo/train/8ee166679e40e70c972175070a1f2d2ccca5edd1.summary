the ambassador went to @entity0 and was asked what he was doing and he denied any wrongdoing , the source told @entity1			2

a member of @entity20 's security detail allegedly " engaged prostitutes while on official trips in foreign countries			1
" the inspector general 's agent assigned to investigate " concluded " that the " prostitution problem was endemic			0
" in @entity130 , an " underground drug ring " may have been operating near the @entity131 and " supplying " drugs to @entity3 security contractors , but an agent sent to investigate the allegations was prevented from completing the job			1
the allegations were first reported monday by @entity139			0
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity140 responded monday			2
controversies knock @entity142 off balance " we hold all employees to the highest standards , " she said			0

" during a tuesday @entity3 briefing with reporters , @entity140 reiterated that the memo contains " unsubstantiated allegations " and that some cases are ongoing and some are closed			1

@entity1 obtained a draft , dated december 2012 , of a report by the inspector general 's office evaluating the performance of the department 's @entity206			0

" the bureau does n't have a manual with approved guidelines on how to investigate cases , the report also says			0
investigators with the inspector general 's office " discovered uncertainty " among state agents about how to conduct thorough investigations , and noted that not going through the proper mechanisms can " ruin " a potential criminal investigation			1
the report also calls the department 's @entity228 " unwieldy " and says that " frequent agent turnover " makes it harder for the @entity206 to conduct investigations			2
the inspector general 's office published a february 2013 final report whose key findings are , largely , the same as stated in the december 2012 draft			0
the division 's current management structure , the report says , does not " foster independence from career pressures and creates significant potential for undue influence , favoritism , and potential retribution			0
