@entity7 , a television editor and producer , had sought $ 4.5 million in damages from @entity1 , his friend since their high school days in suburban @entity12			1
@entity7 claimed to be the creative force behind @entity1 's podcast and contended he was promised 30 % of the company			1
@entity1 completed his testimony in @entity17 on monday ; @entity7 testified last week and the case was winding to a close			1
terms of the settlement were confidential			2
" it was a good deal for my side and a smart deal for his side , " said @entity7 's lawyer , @entity22			2
the deal was reached after the judge issued a ruling that limited @entity7 's claim for damages from 2009 to 2012 , the year @entity1 fired him			1
@entity7 had sought a share of the podcast profits until 2017			1
@entity1 's lawyer , @entity35 , said the ruling caused the plaintiffs to blink			0
" after @entity1 's compelling testimony yesterday and @entity42 ( @entity41 ) @entity40 's ruling today gutting their expert 's damage theory , apparently they finally woke up to the fact that their case was disintegrating before their very eyes , " said @entity35 , who also is a legal analyst for @entity0			0
@entity51 said several jurors told him they were leaning toward @entity7			0
the only question they had , he added , was how high the damage award should be			0
the case told the story of the unraveling of a decades - long friendship between " @entity60 and " @entity61 that began during the 1980s at @entity62			0
@entity1 was a frequent visitor at the @entity64 ' home , often helping himself to food in the family refrigerator			0
when their other friends went away to college , the two rented an apartment and worked odd jobs			0
they rehabbed a 1964 @entity73 limousine , which they drove to clubs and parties , " entourage " - style			0
the saga of ' @entity60 ' and ' the @entity77 ' @entity1 , now 50 , eventually found his niche at a @entity12 fm radio station , @entity79 , and @entity7 worked at several network and syndicated television productions , including " @entity82			1
" he now works as a producer at " @entity84			0
" @entity7 claimed he came up with the idea for @entity1 to launch his podcast in 2009 when he lost his @entity12 morning radio show on @entity89 station @entity90			1
he claimed he was promised a cut of the business in a " handshake deal " but never got it in writing			0
he told the jury that , based on his friend 's word , he walked away from his $ 231,000 - a - year job , took out a second mortgage on his home and encouraged his wife and cousin to join the business even though they might not see an immediate payday			0
the reason : @entity1 was still bound to his @entity89 contract , which included a noncompete clause that kept them from soliciting revenue for the podcast during its first year			2
once the podcast started making money , @entity7 contended , @entity1 pushed him and the others out of the business			1
@entity1 , @entity35 says , always maintained @entity7 was n't the only person who encouraged him to start a podcast			1
@entity1 called @entity7 a " partner " to humor him and honor their longstanding friendship , the lawyer said			2
