-- the @entity3 @entity2 legislator leading an investigation into @entity6 gov. @entity6 's administration says he believes laws were broken when the governor 's aides ordered lane closures at the nation 's busiest bridge			1
" i do think laws have been broken , " state assemblyman @entity13 told @entity0 's @entity14 and @entity15 on saturday			0
" public resources -- the bridge , police officers -- all were used for a political purpose , for some type of retribution , and that violates the law			2
" legislators need to " make sure any violations of law are addressed , " said @entity13 , who 's also deputy speaker			0
@entity6 , who had no public activities scheduled for saturday , and his spokesman could n't be immediately reached for comment			1
meanwhile , @entity32 speaker - elect @entity31 , a @entity33 , will call a special session thursday so lawmakers can vote on extending the subpoena power of the investigation led by @entity13 , @entity31 said			1
the past week 's revelations " clearly show the need for a continued thorough investigation by the @entity32 , " @entity31 said			2
" many questions remain unanswered about this threat to public safety and abuse of power			0
" even while @entity3 call to expand the investigation , @entity46 @entity45 confirmed saturday that @entity6 will visit that state next week to raise money for the re-election effort of gov. @entity51			1
documents : @entity6 appointees stonewalled queries into lane closures " yes , @entity6 will be here next weekend , and we are looking forward to it , " @entity46 @entity45 spokesperson @entity56 said			1
in @entity2 , @entity13 said the legislative committee 's investigation into the scandal " would be made immeasurably simpler if the governor 's office said , ' please tell us what you 'd like			0
we 'll turn over all those documents			0
' " " if the governor really meant what he said , that he wants to get to the bottom of it ... it would only be fair for him to make those documents available , " @entity13 said			0
on friday , the @entity32 committee investigating the @entity76 scandal released more than 2,000 pages of documents suggesting politics was behind the lane closures and showing top @entity6 aides tried to stonewall media inquiries into the matter			1
read the documents @entity6 , a potential presidential candidate in 2016 , has strongly denied involvement in how his aides ordered the lane closures at the bridge as revenge against a neighboring @entity33 mayor who refused to endorse @entity6 in his successful gubernatorial campaign last november			1
the state legislative committee has yet to find any documents indicating @entity6 was involved in the lane closures , @entity13 said saturday			1
but @entity13 charged that it " just strains believability " that @entity6 had no knowledge of how his staff orchestrated the lane closures , which created public safety hazards in @entity99 , @entity2 , where mayor @entity100 had opposed @entity6 's re-election effort			1
@entity13 also suggested that retribution against the @entity99 mayor was the motive behind the lane closures to the bridge , which connects @entity2 and @entity107 , from september 9 to september 13			1
" i think anything 's possible , " @entity13 said			0
" one thing 's clear : the anger that was displayed [ ... ] by people in the governor 's circle after the lane closure was terminated			2
" why are they so angry ? why are they so mad at this process being shut down , " @entity13 asked			0
plenty in his own party happy to see @entity6 get comeuppance @entity6 this week fired his deputy chief of staff , @entity121 , for her role in the lane closure , which was captured in e-mail correspondence that was subpoenaed by @entity3 investigating the matter			1
the e-mail exchanges are among the most damaging evidence so far supporting their assertions the lane closures were politically motivated			2
the correspondence began three weeks before access lanes to the bridge were closed			0
" time for some traffic problems in @entity99 , " @entity121 said in an e-mail to @entity134 , then the highest - level appointee representing the state at the @entity136 and @entity2 , which operates the bridge connecting the two states			0
" got it , " @entity134 replied			0
@entity134 resigned last month from the port authority , where he was the director of interstate capital projects			0
@entity134 asserted the lane closures were part of a traffic study			2
legal woes lurk for @entity6 over scandal @entity0 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			2

new : lawmakers will hold special session thursday to vote on extending probe
new : gov. @entity6 will still raise money for @entity45 governor in @entity46 next week
@entity6 's team used public assets for retribution , says @entity33 leading probe
it " just strains believability " that @entity6 did n't know of lane closures , he says
