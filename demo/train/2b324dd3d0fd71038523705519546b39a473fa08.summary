-- it 's a grass - roots protest movement composed of the newly politicized and people distrustful of hierarchy			2
so how is it possible to be an illegitimate @entity6 member ? ask republicans in @entity8			2
some are accusing @entity10 , a new @entity6 candidate running for @entity11 , of being a fake			1
the allegation ? he was put in the race by agents of senate majority leader @entity17 to siphon votes from the @entity7			1
" no doubt about it , " says @entity19 , one of the many @entity7 @entity11 candidates hoping to challenge @entity17 in november			1
" nobody in the @entity6 knows who he is			2
he did n't know any of the principles of the @entity6 , " @entity19 tells @entity0			2
@entity19 even accuses " @entity17 's staff , campaign , whatever " of picking @entity10 because he 's @entity26 , as is @entity27			1
he explains , " they know the @entity31 are very close , they 'll vote for each other			0
" as for @entity17 , an aide dismisses the accusations			2
as does @entity17 , who says he 's never met @entity10 or " anyone in his family			1
" @entity17 tells @entity0 , " i think there are too many conspiratorialists in the world today			2
this is a free country			0
" @entity41 , the @entity7 front - runner in the @entity11 primary , according to recent polls , is the former @entity45 chair and seems to be the @entity7 ' best hope of unseating @entity17 in november			1
or at least she did , until @entity10 got into the race			0
@entity41 says she 's been very active with @entity6 groups in @entity8			1
" i am a @entity6 voter , absolutely			0
" which is why she says she finds it " a little strange " that @entity10 is emerging now			0
" i do n't know who this person is			0
he 's never been involved with anything that i 'm aware of in this state			0
" she does n't know if he 's a spoiler			0
" we 'll find out for sure , " she promises , adding , " i 've never seen him at one of our tea parties , by the way			0
" it 's clear why @entity41 and @entity19 would be concerned			2
a recent poll conducted for the @entity65 indicates @entity41 and @entity19 each beating @entity17 in one - on - one hypothetical general election matchups			1
but add a @entity6 candidate to the ballot , and that siphons off enough conservative votes to give @entity17 a narrow victory			1
according to the survey , @entity17 would grab 36 percent of the vote , the @entity7 candidate 32 percent and the @entity6 candidate 18 percent in a possible three - way showdown			1
so the conspiracy theories abound from @entity6 activists and worried @entity7 : @entity10 's never attended @entity6 rallies ; he has n't coordinated with local organizers ; the secretary of his @entity6 of @entity8 , @entity82 , is a registered @entity83			1
@entity84 said , " i vote the person , not the party " and calls the accusations " political garbage			0
" but to critics , it 's all proof that @entity10 is , in the words of @entity94 activist and blogger @entity93 , running a " false flag operation			2
" @entity10 seems to find the fuss amusing			1
new to the political scene , he personally gave @entity0 directions to his house for an interview that his wife , daughter and bulldog attended			0
he said it was the first time he 'd spoken with the national media			0
@entity10 , who helped form the @entity6 of @entity8 just to run for this seat , said that he 'd never take marching orders from the @entity109 or @entity17			1
" i have never met @entity17 , do not agree at all with any of his political values , " @entity10 said , adding that he 's not the kind of guy " who would follow or be told what to do			1
" he says he 's fielded endless calls from @entity7 trying to strong - arm him to leave the race , and he resents it : " i do n't think @entity7 own the @entity6 , " @entity10 said			1
" in fact , i know they do n't in @entity8 , because i do			0
that 's what 's really got them in an uproar			0
" he said he 's been told that he 's not welcome on the bus when the @entity6 rolls into @entity8			2
@entity10 says he got into the race because " we are patriots that want change			0
we 're normal people that want to make a difference			0
" first , he plans to make a campaign web site			0
a spokesman for @entity134 , a national @entity6 group that is encouraging efforts to defeat @entity17 at the ballot box in november , says it does not view @entity10 as a serious candidate			1
they say he 's not speaking at either of their two rallies in @entity8 on march 27 , when they kick off their third @entity6 cross-country caravan with events in @entity144 ( @entity17 's hometown ) and @entity65 , but they say he 's welcome to attend			1
@entity134 also says it is not endorsing any candidate in the @entity149 primary .			0

some say @entity10 , a new @entity6 candidate running for @entity11 , is a fake
@entity7 front - runner @entity41 says she 's never seen @entity10 at @entity6 events
another @entity7 candidate alleges @entity17 's campaign planted @entity10 to siphon @entity7 votes
@entity10 seems to find the fuss amusing ; @entity17 dismisses the allegations
