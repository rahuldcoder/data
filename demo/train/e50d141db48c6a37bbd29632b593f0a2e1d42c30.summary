-- it 's hard to think of a time in the history of @entity4 's intelligence community when it has been more battered by accusations of over-stepping or mismanaging its mission : to secretly gather information to support the activities of the @entity4 government the list of recent revelations grew over the weekend with allegations that @entity4 has been systematically spying on its @entity15 allies			1
reports in the @entity15 press , apparently drawn from documents provided by @entity19 , suggested that @entity4 spied on the @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and other close international friends , listening in on encrypted fax transmissions and planting bugs and other devices at 38 embassies and missions in @entity30 and @entity31 , as well as locations in @entity15			1
the timing is not great : the eve of scheduled trade talks with the @entity15 , a priority of the @entity38 administration			1
the new reports have caused a furor across the continent , stoking the uproar caused by earlier @entity19 - related revelations that @entity4 has been listening in on millions of @entity45 calls and e-mails			1
top officials , like secretary of state @entity48 , shrugged it off by saying allies often spy on each other , and others , like former director of the @entity54 and @entity56 gen. @entity55 , noted that some friends spied on us			0
but the damage was done to important relationships and to the @entity38 administration 's prior claims that it would conduct itself according to a different standard than past @entity4 governments			1
all nations collect intelligence , @entity38 says this all comes on the heels of reports that the overreach of the intelligence community begins at home			1
while it will be cold comfort to our @entity81 allies that we are only treating them as we do our own people , the details of programs that warehouse massive amounts of phone metadata and e-mail traffic were the first shock waves produced by the @entity19 leaks			1
but the problems go beyond what @entity19 leaked to the very fact that a comparatively junior contractor could gain top level clearances and access to so much information			0
indeed , it is deeply disturbing that hundreds of thousands of private contractors had @entity97 clearances and that , as we have learned , many may have gone through inadequate screening procedures or been inadequately managed			0
earlier news -- about the scope of @entity4 drone programs managed by the intelligence community , " kill lists , " extra-judicial targeting of perceived threats , the scope of @entity4 's cyberwarfare programs against enemies in @entity109 ( @entity110 ) , @entity111 and elsewhere -- have already called the role of the community into question			1
just last week @entity115 reported that a senior @entity4 military leader very close to president @entity38 and his national security team , gen. @entity118 , was a target of a leak investigation concerning @entity110			2
. these are all stories of a culture of secrecy and of arrogance that has simply gone too far			0
perhaps each and every one of these missions began with a reasonable national security goal			0
but because so much of the planning and execution takes place behind closed doors or in situations in which the term " oversight " is laughably applied to wink - and - a - nod rubber stamping of initiatives , it is perhaps more surprising we have seen so few scandals than that we are dealing now with what seems like so many			0
consider : according to the @entity4 government 's own figures , last year the @entity141 received 1,789 applications for approval of government spying operations and ok 'd all but one			1
since 2001 , according to a report in salon based on government figures collected by the @entity151 , more than 15,000 applications were approved and only 10 denied			0
the @entity152 of @entity154 @entity153 was a less effective rubber stamp			0
the @entity141 is just one of the feeble oversight mechanisms that apparently did not do its job			0
congressional and executive branch officials have bought into the post 9/11 paranoia and hopped up threat mentality and come to accept that even the possibility of an attack on the @entity4 warrants disregard for @entity4 laws and international agreements			1
not to mention the principles of respect for individual liberties and reasonable constraints on government power on which the @entity4 was established			2
this was well illustrated when @entity54 director @entity174 argued that the agency 's massive surveillance programs were warranted because they allegedly stopped " over 50 " terror attacks , with scant reference to the size of the attacks , the real risk posed , whether other means to stop them that did n't involve massive surveillance might exist , or to the possibility that the damage done to civil liberties might be worse than that which might have been produced had the terror plans gone forward			1
opinion : why we 're all stuck in the digital transit zone with @entity19 indeed , senior @entity4 officials have told me that , in their view , a primary motivator for accepting all these programs was fear that resisting would hold dire political consequences for them , should an attack occur			2
in other words , in the modern @entity4 intelligence community , @entity202 has become more important than @entity56			1
there are real threats out there			1
and , yes , other nations spy on us			0
terrorists use new technologies to target @entity4 interests and citizens and must be contained			2
cyberwarfare poses a growing threat to the @entity4 as well as other nations			2
all these facts require analysis and countermeasures by the @entity4 government			2
some require the @entity4 to go on offense			2
but what the revelations show is a series of errors of overreach and bad judgment , not that all our programs should be eliminated			0
the problem here is one of scale and of profoundly compromised and twisted values			0
that problem itself is complicated and exacerbated by @entity4 's emergence as the world 's first cybersuperpower			1
as such , we have sought to flex our technological muscles not only in ways that make us safer but that introduce a new form of constant , low - grade , invisible conflict that makes @entity154 spy games seem quaint in their narrowness -- even if their stakes were much higher			0
in the past , i 've called this @entity252 € ” neither cold nor hot but dangerous nonetheless , not just to our enemies but also to our friends , our interests and our values			0
@entity19 broke the law and if the @entity4 can bring him in , he deserves to be prosecuted			2
but the ones who should be in their own hot seat are those who created , approved and rationalized into existence the sprawling , seemingly uncontainable global intelligence and cyberwarfare apparatus that is as much of a threat to the kind of country we want to be as any terrorist group			0
opinion : why can the @entity4 do about @entity19 ? the problem for us , of course , is the only people with the power to restore balance and common sense limitations to these programs are the ones who let them get so out of control in the first place			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity287 .			0

@entity287 : the @entity4 intelligence community is being *slammed* as overreaching
he says more news of spying , on @entity4 ' @entity15 allies , has drawn shock and anger
he says it 's out of control , with poor oversight and disregard for laws and @entity4 values
@entity287 : there are real threats , but intelligence community has n't shown spying is only answer
