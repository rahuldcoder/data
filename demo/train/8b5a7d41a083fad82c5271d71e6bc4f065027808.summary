@entity0 , @entity1 -- three men who served 18 years in prison following their convictions in a 1993 triple - slaying in @entity7 , @entity1 , walked free friday to cheers from a supportive crowd after entering new pleas in the case			1
" i want to be out			2
i deserve to be out , " said @entity13 , who along with @entity13 and @entity14 , was freed after entering rarely used pleas in which they maintained their innocence but acknowledged that prosecutors have evidence to convict them			1
@entity20 and @entity13 entered what is known as an @entity23 plea on three counts of first degree murder			1
@entity14 entered similar pleas to one count of first degree murder and two counts of second degree murder			1
@entity32 circuit judge @entity31 sentenced the three to the 18 years already served and imposed a 10 - year suspended sentence -- meaning they could be returned to jail if they violate the law			2
" i do n't think that it will make the pain go away to the victim families			2
i do n't think it will make the pain go away to the defendant families , " @entity31 said , adding it was nevertheless the best for all involved			2
@entity20 was previously sentenced to death and @entity14 and @entity13 were given life sentences in the may 1993 slayings of second - graders @entity49 , @entity13 and @entity50			1
the boys ' bodies were mutilated and left in a ditch , hogtied with their own shoelaces			2
prosecutors argued that the men who were convicted , teenagers at the time , were driven by satanic ritual and that @entity20 had been the ringleader			1
critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied the three to the murders and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys ' wounds			1
more recent dna testing also demonstrated no links , according to the men 's supporters			2
@entity20 said after his release that he was " very much in shock , very overwhelmed			2
" " i 'm just tired , " @entity20 said			0
" this has been going on for over 18 years , and it 's been an absolute living hell			0
" @entity13 said he did n't initially want to accept the deal			1
" this was not justice , " he said , adding that he dropped his opposition to pave the way for @entity20 ' release from death row			0
" he had it so much worse than i had it , " @entity13 said of @entity20			1
" it 's just insufferable to put a person through that			0
" while prosecuting attorney @entity93 said the pleas entered friday validate the decision of jurors who sent the men to prison , it also spares @entity1 the possibility of a retrial , which would have been difficult to prosecute after so many years , or a potential civil lawsuit by the men			1
the trio had been on course to win the right to new trials later this year			0
" this is an appropriate resolution to this case at this time , " @entity93 , who works in @entity1 ' second judicial district , told reporters			1
" only time will tell as to whether this was a right decision on my part			0
" although supporters of the men , dubbed the @entity13 , believe the true killer remains free , @entity93 said he believes the pleas resolve the case			1
" i have no reason to believe there was anyone else involved in the homicide of these three children but the three defendants who pled guilty today , " he said			2
but he said the state could file charges against others if new evidence emerges implicating someone else in the case			2
@entity1 attorney general @entity130 said his staff had been helping @entity93 's staff prepare for a state @entity134 hearing on the case scheduled for december			1
but he said he learned this week that @entity93 had accepted a plea deal proposed by the defense			0
" i continue to believe that these defendants are guilty of the crimes for which they have now been twice convicted , " @entity130 said in a release			1
" prosecutors know their cases better than anyone			0
in this case , mr. @entity93 has exercised his discretion in such a way that has led to nine murder convictions that can never be appealed			1
" the case has drawn national attention , with actor @entity149 and singers @entity150 and @entity152 trying to rally support for the men 's release			1
@entity150 and @entity152 were at the courthouse on friday			0
@entity13 , whose stepson @entity13 was one of the three victims , said he believes the three men are innocent and releasing them without exonerating them of the crime is an outrage			1
they did not kill my son , " @entity163 said before the hearing			0
the father of another of the victims , @entity49 , also blasted the decision , but for another reason			0
" i do n't know what kind of deal they worked up , " @entity172 told @entity2 affiliate @entity173 before the hearing			0
" now you can get some movie stars and a little bit of money behind you , and you can walk free for killing somebody			1
" but @entity182 said he was happy that his son would be getting out of prison			0
" i thought it might be some kind of publicity stunt			0
i ca n't believe it but it 's real , " he told @entity173			0
the three men were seeking a retrial in the case , and a hearing had been scheduled for a new trial			2
the state @entity134 ruled in november that the three could present new evidence to the trial court after dna testing between 2005 and 2007 failed to link them to the crime			0
the material included hair from a ligature used to bind @entity50 and a hair recovered from a tree stump near where the bodies were found , @entity201 documents said			0
the hair found in the ligature was consistent with @entity49 's stepfather , @entity209 , while the hair found on the tree stump was consistent with the dna of a friend of @entity209 , according to the documents			0
police have never considered @entity209 a suspect , and he maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders			0
@entity20 and @entity13 said in a news conference after the men were released that they would continue to work to clear their names , something @entity13 said authorities are n't trying to do			1
" they 're not out there trying to find out who really murdered those boys , " he said .			0

the men , who say they are innocent , can now work to free their names , one says
