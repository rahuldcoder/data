@entity0 -- @entity4 's supreme court thursday ordered the cancellation of 122 cellular permits that have been at the center of a multibillion - dollar scandal involving the country 's booming telecommunication sector , attorneys said			1
a telecom minister awarded the licenses in 2008			1
the former minister -- @entity14 -- is in jail for his alleged role in what is believed to be a rigged sale of radio waves to companies			1
lawyer @entity21 called the judgment " historic			0
" " it will change the manner in which corruption will be examined and dealt with in the country , " said @entity21 , also the petitioner			0
the top court directed the country 's telecom regulator to create in the next four months new ways for issuing licenses that it said had been granted in " arbitrary and unconstitutional " manner , attorneys said			1
the 2008 license sale is seen as @entity4 's biggest corruption scandal -- one that rattled prime minister @entity39 's government and investor confidence in @entity42 's third - largest economy			1
a number of corporate executives , bureaucrats and high - profile politicians , including @entity14 , are facing trial in connection with the suspected scam revealed by the national auditor two years ago			0
@entity4 recorded a fiscal deficit of 4.7 % of its gdp in 2010 - 11			2
but @entity39 's top economic adviser , @entity54 , has warned it would be difficult for the country to bring the gap down in the current financial year			0
in 2010 , @entity4 raised billions of dollars from an auction of telecom licenses that surged beyond expectations and helped the country trim its losses			1
an auction of the 2008 controversial sale of the telecom bandwidth , canceled by the supreme court , could generate new revenues for the @entity4 government that is struggling to cut deficits that economists blame on high subsidy bills			1
" over the medium term , we should draw up an appropriate roadmap to reach the @entity75 ( fiscal responsibility and budget management ) target of 3 % of the gdp			0
we must focus particularly on reducing the overall level of subsidies as a proportion of ( the ) gdp , " @entity54 cautioned in his talk on the @entity4 economy on tuesday			2

" we are shocked to see that @entity84 is being penalized for faults the court has found in the government process			0
" business analysts , however , fear the ruling could hurt investment sentiments in @entity4			2
" the judgment , though correct on the aspects of law , leads to a larger question about government policy and the validity of doing business in the country , " said @entity100 , managing director of financial consultancy @entity101			0
" for foreign investors , there 's probably a big concern now that whether the huge amounts of money they put in stand vulnerable in @entity4 courts			2
this ruling , no doubt , has set a bad precedent for further investment in our country , " @entity100 remarked			0
the @entity4 government , cornered by opposition and civil society activists over a raft of corruption cases , sought to downplay business worries			2
" at last , we have put an end to the kind of confusion that prevails in the market , " telecom minister @entity134 , in welcoming the verdict			1
@entity134 insisted the ruling offered clarity to telecom businesses			0
@entity139 , he explained , would be available only through auction and not on a first - come , first - served basis that the court found discriminatory			0
in his comments , @entity143 , head of @entity4 's telecom regulator , suggested subscribers of the affected license holders port out to other service providers within the stipulated four months			1
