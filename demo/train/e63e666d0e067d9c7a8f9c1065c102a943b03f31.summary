@entity1 boss @entity0 has revealed that the inaugural @entity2 of @entity3 in @entity4 will not take place as planned next year , saying the organizers have not raised enough money to fund it			1
raced at 19 circuits around the world , @entity1 generates more than $ 4bn in revenues annually			2
the final 2014 calendar will be approved by motorsport 's governing body , the @entity12 , in december but new races need to have financing in place by now to ensure their plans are on track			2
it was recently revealed that the @entity2 of @entity3 organizers appointed investment bank @entity21 in june to raise $ 100 million which is required for the race to go ahead			1
but @entity0 told @entity23 that they have run out of time			2
" it 's not on the cards for next year , " he said , adding that the problem is " they have n't got any money			0
" however , @entity2 of @entity3 spokesman @entity30 insisted they expected the race would go ahead			1
" we do n't comment on financial matters but we are on track for 2014 and will have a statement following the announcement of the official 2014 @entity1 schedule , " said the spokesman			1
the race was planned to take place on 3.2 miles of public roads in @entity42 , a district in the @entity4 towns of @entity44 and @entity45			1
it snakes alongside the @entity47 and would give the race a spectacular backdrop of @entity51 's historic skyline			0
it has already been postponed once , having been initially scheduled for june this year			2
the wheels started to come off in august 2012 when @entity54 , the president of the race , unexpectedly resigned			0
@entity0 put the brakes on it later that month when the organizers missed payment deadlines in their contract with the @entity61			2
the @entity2 of @entity3 is the only new @entity1 race for over 15 years to be dropped from its slot on the calendar			1
it is also a rare example of a race which was given an @entity1 contract without having the required funding in place			1
the most well - known previous example was that of @entity75 circuit @entity73 , which had a 17 - year contract to host the @entity77 @entity2 from 2010			2
instead , the race stayed at @entity79 after @entity80 failed to raise the Â£ 135 million ( $ 210 million ) required to fund necessary improvements to @entity73			0
@entity0 said the situation in @entity4 " is like @entity73 all over again " and added that " it is such a muddle and a mess that it is not worth doing			1
" he said he originally signed the deal because he believed that the race 's promoter -- @entity88 , managing partner of private equity fund @entity89 -- would be able to raise the required funds			2
" the guy is a multibillionaire and is well - known in @entity44 , " @entity0 said			0
@entity2 of @entity3 spokesman @entity30 declined to comment when asked for a specific response to @entity0 's view that the situation in @entity4 was in disarray			1
construction on the @entity4 site is well under way , and last year three - time world champion @entity100 and former @entity1 driver @entity101 drove demonstration runs on the circuit for the @entity105 team			1
however , a lot of the work has focused on the pit building in a new block of garages which was already planned to be built			0
the plans are close to @entity0 's heart as he has been trying to hold a @entity2 in the @entity113 since the 1980s			2
he has already provided more support to the @entity4 race organizers than their rivals usually receive			1
after tearing up the original contract last year , @entity0 signed a new 15 - year agreement in may when the organizers agreed to hire @entity120 , one of his close confidantes and former chief executive of @entity1 's @entity3 motorsport rival @entity123			1
@entity124 works alongside @entity125 , who was the first investor in the race			0
in 2011 @entity128 provided the initial $ 10.3 million investment in race organizing company @entity130 ( @entity130 ) and obtained an additional $ 10.1 million loan			0
in april this year the @entity61 itself provided the company with a credit facility personally guaranteed by @entity125 , but it still needs $ 100 million to get the green light			0
@entity1 races require a high - octane level of investment			0
tracks typically cost over $ 250 million to build , but using public roads avoids this expense			0
the downside is that there is no asset for investment to be secured on , so the budget for street races is usually supplemented with state funding			0
however , @entity125 has confirmed that no public money will be used in the project			0
the race is part of @entity1 's strategy to break into the lucrative @entity3 market , which is dominated by local rivals @entity155 and @entity123			1
gaining a foothold there is understood to be an important part of revving up the stalled plans to float @entity1 on the @entity161 stock exchange			0
stateside television coverage of @entity1 moved this year to the sports division of @entity164 , the oldest major broadcast network in the @entity3 , and the @entity3 @entity2 returned to the calendar in 2012 after a five - year hiatus			1
it takes place in @entity170 , @entity171 , and a further race in @entity173 is also under consideration			0
losing the @entity4 race could cost @entity1 more than $ 375 million across the duration of its contract , as the annual fee has been estimated at $ 25 million with a small escalation every year			1
however , the investment opportunity overview produced by @entity21 in june states that the @entity2 of @entity3 contract gives the organizers " exclusivity for all @entity1 races across the northeast corridor " so the vacant calendar slot could be filled by another new race in the area			1
@entity0 is also known to be in discussion about a @entity2 in @entity190 , which would also plug the gap left by @entity4			1
meanwhile , in other @entity1 news friday , world champion @entity100 set the fastest time in practice for the @entity195 @entity2 at @entity196			1
@entity100 recorded a time of one minute 49.331 seconds , just edging @entity105 teammate @entity198 by 0.059 seconds			0
@entity200 , in third for @entity199 , was almost a second slower in the afternoon session , while @entity77 's @entity202 , who won the previous round in @entity204 for @entity205 was only 12th quickest			0
@entity100 achieved his time despite missing the last 20 minutes of the session with a rear puncture which left the tire shredded			0
two - time world champion @entity210 of @entity211 was quickest in the morning runs for @entity213 in wet conditions			0
saturday sees final qualifying for sunday 's race , with three - time defending champion @entity100 defending a 38 point lead over @entity200 's teammate @entity218 of @entity219 in the title race .			2

the inaugural @entity2 of @entity3 will not take place in 2014 , says @entity1 boss
@entity0 says race organizers have been unable to raise funding
@entity4 race had been originally scheduled for this year , but was *canceled*
@entity100 fastest in first practice sessions for @entity195 @entity2
