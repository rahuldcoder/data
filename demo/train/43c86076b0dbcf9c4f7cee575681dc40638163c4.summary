the first police officer at the scene of @entity3 's 1996 drive - by murder has revealed the last words spoken by the late rap legend			1
and they 're not exactly peaceful			1
" he looked at me , and he took a breath to get the words out , and he opened his mouth , " says @entity7 , a retired sergeant with the @entity8 , in a new feature with @entity10			1
" and then the words came out : ' f * * k you			2
' " @entity16 : 50 @entity17 @entity3 was shot multiple times on september 7th , 1996			1
after leaving a boxing match with former @entity21 ceo @entity20 , the rapper and his bodyguards got into a scuffle with 21 - year - old @entity26 gang member @entity25 in the lobby of the @entity29 casino			1
@entity7 , who worked with the city 's bike patrol unit , had also been watching the same @entity33 fight , but was unaware of the brawl taking place in the lobby			2
later , a white @entity37 pulled up beside @entity20 and @entity3 while they were stopped at a traffic light and one man began shooting out of the back window			1
@entity7 was the first officer to respond to the grisly scene			1
" i grab the car door and i 'm trying to open it , but i ca n't get it open , " he says			2
" [ @entity20 ] keeps coming up on my back , so i 'm pointing my gun at him			2
i 'm pointing it at the car			2
i 'm yelling , ' you guys lay down ! and you , get the f * * k away from me ! ' and every time i 'd point the gun at him , he 'd back off and even lift his hands up , like ' all right ! all right ! ' so i 'd go back to the car , and here he comes again			2
i 'm like , ' f * * ker , back off ! ' this guy is huge , and the whole time he 's running around at the scene , he 's gushing blood from his head			1
gushing blood ! i mean the guy had clearly been hit in the head , but he had all his faculties			2
i could n't believe he was running around and doing what he was doing , yelling back and forth			2
" @entity16 : @entity71 to star in @entity3 - inspired musical @entity7 says when he finally was able to open the door , @entity3 's limp body fell out of the vehicle , " like he was leaning against the door			1
" " so i grabbed him with my left arm , and he falls into me , and i 've still got my gun in the other hand , " he continues			2
" he 's covered with blood , and i immediately notice that the guy 's got a ton of gold on -- a necklace and other jewelry -- and all of the gold is covered in blood			0
that has always left an image in my mind			0
after i pulled him out , @entity20 starts yelling at him , ' pac ! pac ! ' and he just keeps yelling it			0
and the guy i 'm holding is trying to yell back at him			0
he 's sitting up and he 's struggling to get the words out , but he ca n't really do it			0
and as @entity20 is yelling ' @entity3 ! , ' i look down and i realize that this is @entity3			1
" @entity7 says he attempted to get a " dying declaration " of a potential suspect from @entity3 , but the rapper was ignoring him at first			1
" and then i saw in his face , in his movements , all of a sudden in the snap of a finger , he changed , " he says			0
" and he went from struggling to speak , being noncooperative , to an ' i 'm at peace ' type of thing			0
he went from fighting to ' i ca n't do it			0
' and when he made that transition , he looked at me , and he 's looking right in my eyes			0
and that 's when i looked at him and said one more time , ' who shot you ? '			1
he looked at me and he took a breath to get the words out , and he opened his mouth , and i thought i was actually going to get some cooperation			0
and then the words came out : ' f * * k you			0
' after that , he started gurgling and slipping out of consciousness			0
" @entity16 : @entity128 covers @entity3 at @entity129 so why is @entity7 coming forward with with information in 2014 ? two reasons : retiring from the @entity132 has allowed him the freedom to speak about the homicide case without being reprimanded ( " it 's been almost 18 years , " he says			1
there 's clearly never going to be a court case on this			0
" ) , and he also did n't want " @entity3 to be a martyr or a hero because he told the cops ' f * * k you			1
' " @entity7 says @entity3 never spoke another word -- remaining silent even when another officer tried to draw out a declaration in the ambulance			1
" as soon as he got to the hospital , he went into surgery and was heavily sedated , and i guess he went into a coma and really never came out of that , until they took him off of life support , " he continues			0
" so that moment i talked to him was his last real living moment where he was speaking			0
i talked to the cop who rode in the ambulance with him			0
he said @entity3 never came out of it , and he never said anything at the hospital			1
