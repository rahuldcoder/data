even after decades of battling one of the world 's biggest killers , the treatment of cancer is still an inexact science			1
successful methods such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells , but they also destroy healthy tissue			1
health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer -- and everything from monoclonal antibodies , which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells , to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success			1
in @entity24 , engineer and nuclear physicist @entity22 is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation ; a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects			1
" i started to designing equipment ( for ) proton therapy of cancer -- that was a radically new idea , " @entity22 told @entity2			1
encased in a two - metre thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield , one of @entity22 's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients			1
" in this space we accelerate the protons and we give them a higher and higher velocity until they reach two thirds of the speed of light -- that 's 200,000 km per second and this acceleration takes place in the shape of a spiral , " he said			0
" that 's needed if you want to be able to penetrate one foot into the body of a patient			0
" once the proton beam has been generated , it 's piped into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful dose of targeted radiation that kills only those cancerous cells			1
" it does a lot less collateral damage to the patient , " @entity22 said			0
" that 's the great thing about proton therapy			2
" while proton therapy is a giant step forward , it 's not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for			2
so far , it is not effective against all types of cancer			0
" there are a number of cancers which are not localized , " he said			0
" if you look at leukemia , which is cancer of the blood cells , there is nowhere to shoot -- it 's all through the body			2
" the other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap			0
each system -- and the bunker needed to house it -- does n't leave much change from $ 125 million			1
currently there are just 43 operational particle therapy facilities worldwide , with a total of 121 treatment rooms			2
as the fame of the process has started to spread , some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment			0
one @entity105 couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors ' permission to get to a proton center in @entity112 in the @entity113			0
@entity115 treatment is limited on @entity105 's @entity116			2
just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors			2
other centers , however , are currently in development			0
while the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by 2018 , with an estimated 300 proton therapy rooms , @entity22 's @entity126 - based company @entity125 is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible			1
" it would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it -- a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year			1
" at the moment , fewer than 1 % of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy , but @entity22 is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer			1
" i have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid , " he said			0
" that 's something i really cherish			0
when i feel a bit depressed , for whatever reason , i go back to those letters and they are very exciting			0

successful treatments such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells , but they also destroy healthy tissue
in @entity24 , one company is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation
the machines cost as much as $ 125 million , but the company is developing a smaller system for hospitals
