-- @entity1 is the b - movie bruiser of the moment			1
he appears in the occasional @entity5 gangster head game , but his genre of choice is the revved - up testosterone action film			1
the key to his charisma is that he 's so much more cutthroat smart and elegant , and so much more coolly @entity12 , than an actor from the crash - cars - and - ask - questions - later school needs to be			1
with his shaved skull and handsome you - talkin ' - to - me stare , he 's like a @entity19 mad - dog avenger crossed with a more sociopathic @entity20			2
as @entity21 , the title character of " @entity23 , " @entity1 is playing one of those super-stealth hitmen who can sneak into the most protected of lairs and slip away moments later with the target dead			2
