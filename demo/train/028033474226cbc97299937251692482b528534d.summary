-- just six weeks after the @entity4 @entity3 rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers , a government - appointed panel has recommended just that			1
the three - member panel , headed by former defense chief marshal @entity11 , made 22 recommendations monday on how the country should deal with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt to reach its shores each year			1
the report 's release came after a particularly busy weekend for maritime authorities , who intercepted six separate boats carrying a total of 265 people in the three days to sunday			0
it also came as officials investigated claims a boat carrying more than 60 asylum seekers had disappeared en route from @entity31 to @entity32 , a popular entry point to @entity4 's asylum system			1
read more : asylum seekers risking all to escape dangers of home among the @entity11 report 's recommendations was that offshore processing centers be established on the islands of @entity42 and @entity43 " as soon as practical			1
" it also recommended an immediate increase in the number of people accepted each year for asylum from 13,750 to 20,000			0
in an effort to reduce the demand for family reunions , it recommended barring people who arrive by boat from being able to sponsor their families to join them			0
and rather than dumping the government 's controversial and illegal " @entity57 , " the report recommended building on the deal " through high - level bilateral engagement focused on strengthening safeguards and accountability			2
" under the so - called " @entity57 , " @entity4 would have sent 800 asylum seekers to @entity65 for processing each year in exchange for 4,000 confirmed refugees			1
however , the @entity68 ruled the deal invalid last august on the grounds that , as a non-signatory to the 1951 @entity72 , @entity65 has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers , something required under @entity4 's @entity76			1

" we will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion , " she added			0
refugee advocates reacted with outrage to the report , calling it a " rebadging of the @entity95 , " a reference to the former @entity99 government 's controversial policy of the last decade			1
" at the heart of the panel 's report is the policy of deterrence , but all deterrence does is divert people from our doorstep to dangers elsewhere			2
it does n't address the circumstances , it just shifts the problem somewhere else , " said @entity109 , executive director of @entity4 's @entity110			0
" what we need to do is promote proper protection standards in the region			0
there needs to be the understanding that it will take time , perseverance and patience			0
there are no simple solutions , " he added			0
the so - called @entity95 was introduced by former prime minister @entity126 in 2001 and involved sending asylum seekers to detention centers on @entity130 nations while their claims were processed			1
the current @entity133 government abandoned the policy when it took power in 2007			0
since then , there has been a sharp increase in asylum seekers making the dangerous trip by boat to seek a new life in @entity4			1
between late 2001 and june this year , 964 asylum seekers and crew died at sea			2
of those , more than 600 lost their lives in the last three years , according to the report			0
" to do nothing is unacceptable -- so we have proposed a new approach			0
one that is comprehensive , integrated and equitable , " said refugee expert and panel member @entity152			2
in a statement , @entity156 's refugee spokesman @entity155 said he was " appalled " by the panel 's recommendations			2
" sending asylum seekers to places like @entity65 , @entity42 and @entity43 is unacceptable and a complete outsourcing of @entity4 's human rights obligations			1
" the ' @entity95 ' was a failed policy , and a wildly expensive one , that was internationally condemned for breaching the human rights of some of the world 's most vulnerable people , " he added			0
@entity109 said it was questionable whether @entity42 would meet the requirements to be considered as a legally viable option for offshore asylum centers			1
" although @entity42 and @entity43 have signed the @entity72 , neither country has its own laws in place to protect refugees nor are there any proper legal guarantees that refugees would be protected , and there are serious concerns about human rights conditions on the ground , " he said			2
@entity4 's politicians have long been at odds over the country 's official response to asylum seekers			1
while the opposition coalition has backed the reopening of offshore centers , the move has been fiercely resisted by the @entity196 which claims it breaches human rights			0
in late june , the senate rejected the @entity199 ( the @entity200 which would have allowed @entity4 to send asylum seekers to @entity65 and @entity42 for processing			1
@entity80 said she is willing to compromise further to reach agreement and a policy on the issue			0
the panel estimated that if all the report 's recommendations were adopted , they would cost us $ 1 billion to implement .			2
