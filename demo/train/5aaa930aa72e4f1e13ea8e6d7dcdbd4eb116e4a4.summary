sometimes , if he said ' we should do something ' i was feeling tired ... that 's why sometimes we have to fight			2

" she was certainly much more aggressive than i was , dictating the play			2
i was always on the defense , " said @entity7 , who lost to @entity4 in last year 's final			1
" when i had my opportunities and break points in games that went to deuce , i do n't think any of them really went my way today			2
" in the other semifinal , world @entity74 ended the run of @entity79 teenager @entity78 -- who famously knocked out one of the tournament favorites , @entity82			1
but the @entity83 was forced to overcome an injury scare on her way to a 6 - 1 6 - 4 win over her 19 - year - old opponent , who saved five match points and broke back to 5 - 4 in the second set before @entity4 took a lengthy break for medical treatment			1

" i almost did the choke of the year right now , " she said			0
" at 5 - 3 , having so many chances and i could n't close it out			0
i was a bit overwhelmed realizing i was one step away from the final			2
nerves got into me , for sure			0
" the 23 - year - old clarified her comments at her later press conference			0
" i 'm telling you honestly that my back was bothering me , " @entity4 said			1
" it took me too long of a time to call the trainer , which was my mistake			0
i took it to the point where i could n't breathe , which was causing from my back problem , and i could n't really figure out what was going on on the court			2
when the trainer told me that was the rib that was blocking that , my back , that 's what happened			2
" when you can not breathe you start to panic			0
i was really panicking , not because i could n't convert my match point			1
that 's not the case			0
i mean , i 'm experienced enough to go over those emotions			0
" but when you can not breathe , when something 's really blocking you , the stress , that was the stress i was talking about			0
i just could n't realize what was going on with me			0
" @entity78 refused to criticize @entity4 , with whom she shares an agent			1
