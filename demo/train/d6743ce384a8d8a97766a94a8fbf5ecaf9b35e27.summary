now that the @entity1 has upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate , it 's time to focus on what has always been a key goal of health reform : controlling health care costs			1
no matter how you count it , health care spending is large -- and growing at a worrisome rate			1
in 2011 , @entity12 spent $ 2.7 trillion on health care , almost 18 % of our gdp			1
the federal government spends more on health care than on defense , @entity19 or any other single expenditure category			1
investments that could have gone into important areas like education or infrastructure are instead diverted into footing our health care bills			2
the individual mandate by itself will have little effect on costs			1
this is because the main effect of the mandate is to add a relatively small number of people , about 15 million , to the insurance rolls			0
the vast majority of @entity12 , more than 250 million , already get their health insurance on the job or from public programs such as @entity39 and @entity40			0
the mandate alone was never going to change their health spending patterns			2
however , this does not mean that the court 's decision will have no effect on health spending			1
the @entity49 contains many provisions intended to drive the health care system toward providing greater value			1
it would not be an overstatement to say that , with the exception of eliminating the tax break for employer - sponsored health insurance , the health reform law contains almost every idea that anyone , @entity60 or @entity61 , has had in the past 10 years , about how to increase quality and efficiency in the health care system			1
these ideas include accountable care organizations , patient - centered medical homes , value - based purchasing in @entity39 , incentives for hospitals to provider better , safer and more efficient care , an excise tax on " @entity75 " health plans , and better information about treatment effectiveness to help patients and providers make informed decisions			2
the value - based purchasing program , for example , will change the way @entity39 pays hospitals for inpatient care			0
instead of paying hospitals for the amount of care they provide , @entity39 payments will now also depend on the quality of care provided			0
the idea is that by following best practices , hospitals will forgo unnecessary care , help patients recover faster and spend less			0
some of these reforms targeting the health care delivery system are novel , and experts are rightly cautious in their predictions about what they can accomplish and whether they will " bend the curve " of health care spending until it is sustainable			1
there are other ideas out there on how we can reduce the federal government 's obligations -- notably the plan advanced by rep. @entity109 , @entity110 , which takes the brute force approach of simply shifting costs from the government to states and individuals			0
the @entity49 is the better choice			0
instead of papering over our problems by shifting ever - increasing costs to those least able to afford care or depriving people of the services they need , the health reform law applies the most creative thinking to address the roots of our spending problems			2
today , the court gave us the green light to get on with seeking solutions to the underlying problem of inefficient spending			0
it permitted the government to do what it should , to innovate in the face of a seemingly intractable social problem			0
not everyone is happy with the decision			0
but no one can deny that it opens a new chapter in our history as we move forward on a bold and necessary policy experiment .			2
