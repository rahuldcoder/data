-- actress and filmmaker @entity1 has a special connection to @entity4			1
her friend and onetime nanny , @entity7 , was chosen as a @entity8 in 2008 for her work starting a school for @entity12 orphans in her native @entity13			1
@entity1 sat down with @entity0 senior producer @entity14 to talk about @entity4			1
below are excerpts from that interview			2
@entity14 : you have a very personal connection with @entity7 , do n't you ? @entity1 : well , let me just say that i 'm the one who discovered @entity7			1
i knew ! no , @entity7 was my employee ; she worked as my nanny for a decade			1
i knew from the second @entity7 walked in to the interview there was something special about her			1
she leads her life in such a positive way that she 's just a great example for me			2
@entity28 : so besides the personal connection , why is this cause so important to you ? @entity32 : my grandfather died of @entity12 back in the late ' 80s , when a blood transfusion in a hospital could give you @entity36 and @entity12			1
so i 'm personally , obviously , connected to this disease and wanting to find a cure			2
but then you look at continents like @entity40 and how the population is completely annihilated by it			2
with @entity7 , to see her family members that have succumbed to the disease and the children in her village that are all left behind -- not only without parents , but without an education -- it just seems like an obvious cause to get behind			1
and it 's just remarkable when you think of what one person , a nanny of all professions , was able to do while working for me full time			2
to me , @entity7 's picture is in the dictionary next to the word " hero			1
" @entity28 : this is your third year of involvement with @entity4 -- @entity32 : riding @entity7 's coattails			1
[ laughter ] yes , i 'm so appreciative of all that you guys do and personally how i 've been affected by what you do			0
@entity28 : how have you been inspired by some of the @entity4 that you 've met ? @entity32 : they 're amazing			1
the fact that they do so much in their own lives , it 's like they 're so separate but so organically similar			0
there are so many parallels about these remarkable people that give so much of themselves to help others for very little fanfare			0
that 's what i love about this event			0
it gives this , you know , just due recognition , knowing firsthand what @entity7 did @entity93 acknowledgment , and post			1
she 's been able to build a secondary school			2
now they have a school bus			2
now her goal is to change the curriculum of aids education in all of @entity40			0
it feels like none of that would have been possible without the exposure that @entity4 has given her			0
@entity28 : why do you think celebrities like you keep coming back to help us out , year after year ? @entity32 : i think we 're all inspired			1
we 're all just regular people and want to do our part			0
i want to be close to what you guys are doing , i want to do more			0
i ca n't wait to see who 's being honored this year			0
i look forward to that night and just being a part of it			0
being there live , it 's in your blood , you know ? you just feel like you 're walking on air to meet these people			0
@entity28 : why do you think we need to honor everyday heroes ? @entity32 : we all could use a little inspiring			1
to see what our neighbor is doing to help others , i think , makes us do better and be better			0
it makes you feel good			0
it makes you feel like you 're doing something worthwhile			0
we all can do a lot more than we 're doing .			0
