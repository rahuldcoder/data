@entity0 -- the manufacturers of seven caffeinated alcoholic beverages labeled a " public health concern " have stopped producing or shipping the products , the @entity2 announced wednesday			1
last week , the @entity2 sent warning letters to four beverage makers saying the addition of caffeine to alcoholic beverages was not approved by the agency and it was an " unsafe food additive			1
" the agency said discussions with the companies resulted in these actions : -- @entity21 of @entity22 , @entity23 , has ceased producing caffeinated alcoholic beverages , is no longer shipping such products and expects to have all of its caffeinated alcoholic beverages off retail store shelves by december 13			1
@entity21 is the maker of @entity21			0
-- @entity26 , @entity27 - based @entity25 has ceased shipping its caffeinated alcoholic beverage @entity29 and expects to have its product off retail store shelves by december 13			1
@entity25 also said that it no longer markets @entity32 , another caffeinated alcoholic beverage listed in the warning letter			0
-- @entity38 of @entity39 , @entity40 , ceased producing its caffeinated alcoholic beverages , @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37 , in september and has not shipped any caffeinated alcoholic beverages since early november			0
-- @entity43 of @entity44 , @entity45 , has ceased manufacturing its caffeinated alcoholic beverage , @entity47			0
the warning letters last wednesday followed a year - long review by the @entity2 , which gave the companies 15 days to either reformulate their products or face possible seizure under federal law , said dr. @entity54 , the agency 's principal deputy commissioner			1
experts have said the caffeine in the beverages can mask the effects of alcohol , leaving drinkers unaware of how intoxicated they are			1
" @entity2 does not find support for the claim that the addition of caffeine to these alcoholic beverages is ' generally recognized as safe , ' which is the legal standard , " @entity54 told reporters			1
" to the contrary , there is evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern			1
" @entity43 proprietor @entity77 told @entity1 last week she was puzzled by the @entity2 's decision to include @entity47 on its list			1
@entity77 described @entity47 as a craft beer that has about 4 percent alcohol by weight and about two - thirds the caffeine of a cup of coffee , and is sold in only three cities -- " and yet it 's being singled out with @entity21 and @entity29			1
" wednesday , @entity77 claimed the @entity2 has not had a clear policy on caffeinated alcohol			1
" they have not done their homework , " she said			0
" i 'm not going to stop forever			2
" moonshot is " absolutely , positively " safe and was marketed to " beer lovers who want a caffeinated choice , " she said			0
@entity21 announced last week that it was dropping caffeine and two other ingredients , guarana and taurine , from @entity21 in the face of " a difficult and politically charged regulatory environment			2
" @entity21 has been nicknamed " blackout in can " by some users			0
@entity54 called @entity21 's decision to drop those ingredients a " positive step			2
" and in a statement issued after the decision , the company said it was pleased by @entity2 's response			2
" as we stated yesterday , we have stopped the production and shipment of all our products containing these ingredients , " the company said last week			2
@entity25 previously said it was unaware " of a single incident of injury or other harm associated with its products			0
" the company declined comment wednesday			0
messages left wednesday with @entity123 were not immediately returned			0
the @entity2 began its review in november 2009 after complaints from officials in several states			2
the controversy exploded last month , when nine underage students at @entity131 were hospitalized after drinking @entity21 , both on its own and mixed with other drinks , police reported			0
critics say drinks like @entity21 mix caffeine equal to the amount in three cups of coffee with the alcoholic equivalent of three cans of beer and are designed to appeal to younger consumers accustomed to consuming high - caffeine energy drinks			1
a 23.5 - ounce can of @entity21 contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume , depending on state regulations			2
@entity21 has compared @entity21 to popular drinks like rum and cola or @entity152 coffee that also mix caffeine and alcohol			1
but " we did n't see these kinds of events when people were drinking @entity152 coffees , " @entity155 , @entity0 's state attorney general , told reporters earlier this month			0
" what we 're seeing now is striking , and we need to take quick action , " @entity162 said			0
@entity0 and four other states -- @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 -- already had taken steps to remove @entity21 and similar drinks from store shelves			0
and @entity173 , director of the @entity174 , praised the @entity2 for moving against products he said are " designed , branded , and promoted to encourage binge drinking			1
" @entity1 's @entity177 contributed to this report .			0
