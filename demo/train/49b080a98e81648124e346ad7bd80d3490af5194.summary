-- author @entity1 , who has been a boss and worked for male and female bosses , has a list of tips she 's titled , " how to tell a @entity6			2
" -- a male boss is aggressive ; a female boss is pushy			2
-- a male boss is attentive to details ; a female boss is picky			2
-- he knows how to follow through ; she does n't know when to quit			2
-- he 's ambitious ; she 's driven			2
-- he loses his temper occasionally ; she ca n't control her emotions			2
-- he is n't afraid to say what he thinks ; she 's mouthy			2
-- he 's a man of action ; she 's impulsive			1
-- he controls his emotions ; she 's cold			2
-- he thinks before he acts ; she ca n't make up her mind			0
-- he thinks before he speaks ; she second - guesses herself			1
-- he tells it like it is ; she 's tactless			0
the list might read like an e-mail forward that people laugh at , but considering the average @entity34 woman earns approximately 21 percent less than the average man , is there any truth to these perceptions ? " i can tell you that the exact same behavior is judged differently , depending on whether it 's a male or a female doing the behavior			1
this is true at all levels in the organization , " says @entity1 , author of " @entity46 i learned from other women			0
" it 's all about perceptions @entity53 , author of " @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , " says she sees the differences in how people perceive professional men and women			0
@entity61 says leaders of both genders can show aggression and still be accepted by their employees			1
the problem arises for midlevel professionals			0
" @entity75 , berating underlings , slamming doors , throwing chairs and loud , truculent phone conversations with vendors on speakerphone that everyone can hear can sometimes be career - stallers , " @entity61 explains			1
" if a woman acts out , underlings will gossip about her , and eventually their whispers will be overheard by someone in top management			1
if a man in the middle behaves in the same way , sometimes underlings will strive to ally with him			1
they may perceive that he is powerful or protected			0
his behavior is still errant , but it 's less likely to get him in trouble because he 'll have more allies to defend him if push comes to shove			0
" obviously , abrasive behavior is n't the entire problem			0
how people react to it is also an issue , and it carries over into other types of workplace behavior			0
" crying is the worst emotion to show at the office , and unfortunately , this is generally a female response , " @entity61 says			1
" @entity103 makes everyone around you feel like you 're weak and out of control , and it will positively unnerve some men in the office who wo n't know how to react			1
crying seems to be mildly acceptable in certain circumstances ( such as when a female employee is laid off ) ; it 's never acceptable as a response to a disagreement or office showdown			1
" naturally , if people did n't let tears unnerve them , becoming emotional would n't be a problem			0
but the fact that we use " emotional " to describe tears -- but not screaming -- alludes to the problem , considering that they 're both effects of an emotion			1
beware of the ' crazy ' woman clinical social worker @entity125 has been a therapist for more than 20 years and has seen the problem firsthand			1
" unfortunately , it has been my experience that the workplace is more forgiving of a man than a woman , " @entity125 says			1
" a man being emotional usually means inability to control temper			1
a woman being emotional is being ' crazy			1
' " in @entity125 's opinion , the problem does n't come only from men			0
she says women are more tolerant of a man 's unfavorable behavior than a woman 's			1
as a result , a strong woman is seen as competition by male and female colleagues alike , putting her in a tougher spot than her male counterparts			1
@entity61 suggests you try to understand the behavior			0
you do n't have to like it , but you might be able to handle it with less bias			0
" i feel that sometimes people react at the office in a similar way as they 've been conditioned to in their personal lives , " she says			1
fits of rage could be the result of upbringing or a current household , not necessarily your performance			0
" if you happen to be on the receiving end of [ someone 's ] outbursts , it 's helpful to remind yourself that most over-the - top reactions are not about business ... it is personal , and it 's about something in that person 's life that has nothing whatsoever to do with you			1
the person is just venting steam			0
" does that mean you have to accept what 's happening ? no. learning how to deal with an angry boss is one thing ; learning how to stand up for yourself is another			0
know when to speak up if you 're a woman , you could find yourself in this situation more often than you 'd like			1
author @entity183 still remembers a specific instance when she let intimidation get the best of her			0
" i was the only woman on the executive team of our small chemical manufacturing company			2
at meetings , whenever i would voice my opinion , one male chauvinist -- the vice president of manufacturing -- would sit with his head in his hands , elbows on the table , looking down at the floor , " @entity183 says			0
" it was very clear what he was saying : ' why in the world would this woman be allowed to sit at the same table with us men , daring to give advice to the president of the company ? ' " @entity183 had n't received that kind of hostility while at the company for 16 years prior to his arrival , and she did n't confront him on the issue			2
" to this day , i 'm embarrassed that i did not deal with it better as i let it fluster me , " she recalls			0
" but it did n't make me stop speaking up when called for			0
" even if @entity183 did n't address the vp , she did n't let him alter her behavior because she knew the problem was his and not hers			0
when you think about it , if an outspoken woman is going to be called mouthy and a quiet one will be labeled a pushover , what do you have to lose by being strong - willed ? &copy @entity0 2011			1
