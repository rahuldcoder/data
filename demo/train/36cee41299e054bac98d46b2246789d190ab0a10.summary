-- say hello to the new captain			2
in the first issue of @entity5 's " @entity4 , " in stores today , onetime sidekick @entity2 sheds his @entity8 persona and picks up the captain 's patriotic shield			1
@entity2 replaces @entity11 , who begins to age rapidly after losing a battle ( he came from the @entity15 era , after all			1
) with a woman taking over the role of @entity19 , an @entity16 is yet another example of the diversity trend in comic books			0
@entity0 recently spoke to writer @entity23 on what to expect with this big change			0
@entity0 : what led to this decision to hand over the role of @entity11 ? @entity23 : i had been writing @entity11 for a little bit ; he 's this kid raised in the @entity31 , and i wanted to explore that			1
that story has been the status quo of @entity11 since the 1960s			1
as i was developing the series , i fell more in love with @entity2 as a character and realized that in @entity5 continuity time , he would be a @entity39 , as am i. he 'd have a more modern sensibility and be able to speak to an audience the way @entity11 would n't be able to , so we started building the story from there			1
@entity0 : how will @entity2 handle things differently than @entity11 ? @entity23 : the two characters both come from a tumultuous , difficult place			1
but @entity2 is somebody who is n't reflecting on things as a soldier			1
he wants to stand up and put himself between the forces of evil and corruption and things that would harm the everyday citizen			0
@entity2 will not be working as closely with @entity55 as @entity11 ( spoiler alert ! )			1
ultimately , the way they approach problems will be quite different			0
@entity0 : what will @entity11 's role be now ? @entity23 : @entity11 -- who has aged now ; time has caught up to him -- will still be a tactician , providing his military experience			1
@entity11 is almost an eye in the sky			2
since he is incapable of serving as @entity11 , he will be at the @entity67 mansion at the command station			2
beyond that , he 'll be a military strategist , the one thing that @entity2 really is n't			2
@entity0 : what have you heard from fans ? @entity23 : the feedback 's been great ! obviously , there 's been a few ugly comments and people who have taken offense to the change for various reasons			0
but that 's been the challenge of the modern era , to ignore the hate online and to focus on the positivity			0
one of the things we got were photos of kids holding the shield			0
we got a photo from a predominantly @entity93 classroom , where the kids were jumping up and down with joy with the image of @entity2 behind them			2
culturally , that 's something that is significant			0
if it helps one kid feel a part of something and makes them feel that they are reflected in their heroes ... that 's a wonderful byproduct that will hopefully have more positive effects than just being an exciting superhero comic			0
@entity0 : will @entity2 meet up with other characters , like the new thor ? @entity23 : @entity111 -- who is the writer of " @entity19 " -- he and i have been cooking up some potential crossovers for the two books , along with appearing in " @entity67 " stories			1
@entity0 : how long will this last ? @entity23 : when i proposed it originally , it was seen as " you ca n't do it unless it 's going to be a long - term change			1
" depending on how well i do my job and people 's reaction , this could be a permanent change or something that goes on for a good long while			2
@entity0 : what can fans expect in upcoming issues ? @entity23 : i wanted to put @entity2 into something that felt like a traditional " @entity11 " comic book but wanted him to come up against an insurmountable wall unlike anything @entity11 has even faced			1
this is basically the rise of @entity137 in the @entity138 , in a way we 've never seen a terrorist organization rise before			0
under the watch of @entity144 and chancellor @entity145 , they 're moving forward with some big @entity147 - ian evil plans			0
@entity137 has already won before @entity2 realizes that they 're up to something			2
we put him up against a huge wall that 's going to have giant ramifications for the entire @entity138			0
that has implications we can appreciate in the world we 're living in today .			0
