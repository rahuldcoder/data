-- there is nothing new about the tension between the @entity4 and @entity5			1
relations have swung from crisis to crisis ever since the fall of the @entity10 in 1979			0
but recently , this tension is turning into outright confrontation and the threat of war			2
in october 2011 , an alleged @entity5 plot to kill the @entity17 ambassador to the @entity4 became public			1
a month later , the @entity18 issued a report that showed @entity5 had experimented with virtually every element of nuclear weapons production and studied how to put nuclear weapons on its missiles			1
in december , the @entity4 passed new sanctions designed to halt @entity5 oil exports that nearly crippled @entity5 's ability to conduct international banking ; the @entity28 passed similar sanctions this january			1
in response , @entity5 carried out a massive naval exercise in the @entity32 and @entity33			2
it issued threats to close the @entity32 and even demanded that @entity4 warships should not enter the @entity32			2
@entity5 announced it was dispersing the highly enriched uranium it had already produced at @entity37 and putting more advanced centrifuges inside a deeply buried site in a mountain in @entity41			0
on january 30 , secretary of defense @entity42 warned that @entity5 might have a basic nuclear device within a year , although actual weapons would take more time to produce			1
@entity46 's top political leadership threatened @entity5 more directly than ever before , and @entity5 's president , @entity47 , issued new calls for @entity46 's destruction			1
@entity5 is now far closer to making real nuclear weapons -- perhaps 2 to 3 years at most if it were to act decisively			1
@entity5 is also hiding its nuclear efforts and bringing new deeply sheltered facilities to full production			2
as a result , @entity46 may lose much of its capability to attack key targets in the course of this year , and some analysts put the deadline as early as this spring			0
the fear such an attack might come when the @entity4 and @entity63 sanctions might still work is a key reason @entity42 and president @entity65 have expressed their concerns to @entity46			1
the @entity4 is quietly building up its forces in the @entity32 , sending ballistic missile defense cruisers to the @entity70 and a " mother ship " for special forces and mine sweeping to the @entity32			0
while it is making clear it prefer negotiations , the @entity4 is also developing new weapons for its @entity77 bombers that can strike at @entity5 's underground nuclear facilities			1
last week @entity5 's @entity79 , the @entity80 , issued new threats to @entity46			1
@entity46 leaders again raised the prospect of preventive strikes on @entity5			1
secretary @entity42 cautioned @entity46 against such action and president @entity65 offered @entity46 new security guarantees			0
the @entity88 debated even stronger sanctions			0
none of this has to end in war			0
@entity46 may be issuing veiled and not - so - veiled threats to push @entity5 towards negotiations			1
the @entity4 may be publicly asking for @entity46 restraint as much to get @entity5 's attention as out of fear that @entity46 might strike			1
@entity5 could pause its programs and receive benefits in terms of cheaper fuel for its nuclear reactor program , a mix of trade and investment incentives , and an end to sanctions			2
last week , visits by @entity110 officials to @entity5 may have failed , but future visits may succeed as @entity5 comes under greater pressure			0
nothing about history offers any certainty about the future			0
tensions and fears are rising in @entity46 and the @entity32			0
a misstated or misinterpreted threat , or some seemingly minor incident in @entity121 , @entity122 , or @entity123 could trigger a process of escalation that could lead to serious conflict			0
@entity128 forces and capabilities for asymmetric warfare are steadily building on all sides			0
the clock is ticking on preventive @entity46 or @entity4 military options as @entity5 gets closer to full nuclear capability			1
unless @entity5 begins to negotiate with the @entity135 and halts its nuclear program , every passing month will raise the threshold of risk of some kind of serious clash in the @entity32			1
@entity46 may feel it ultimately can not compromise			0
the risk of war will grow and can lead to threats or actions that raise oil prices even further			2
the @entity4 is critically dependent on a healthy world economy that derives most of its oil from the @entity32			0
put simply , at a time of economic uncertainty , how the confrontation between @entity5 and @entity46 plays out has as much effect on those in the @entity153 as those in @entity155			2
the impact of the new @entity4 and @entity63 sanctions will not be fully felt in @entity5 until july			2
until then , it 's hard to say what will happen from today to tomorrow			0
