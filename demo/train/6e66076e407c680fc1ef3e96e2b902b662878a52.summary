@entity0 -- the @entity2 has refused a lower court 's unusual request to decide whether a shocking 45 - year - old civil rights crime can be prosecuted decades later			1
the justices monday dismissed an appeal involving @entity8 , convicted in the 1964 kidnapping of two teenagers whose bodies were found in a backwater area of the @entity13			1
the reputed former @entity15 member had long been suspected in the crime , but it was officially unsolved until @entity8 was indicted in 2007 , and later convicted			1
he is serving three life sentences			0
the move by the high court not to get involved keeps in place @entity8 's original indictment , but does not resolve the larger question of whether similar cases can be prosecuted			1
the issue could have enormous implications for several dozen " cold cases " involving racially motivated crimes dating back to the 1950s			0
@entity8 had appealed his conviction , claiming the statute of limitations had expired five years after the crime			1
the confusion arises over the fact that kidnapping could be considered a capital offense in 1964 , and thus had no time limit for a prosecution			0
the high court in 1968 eliminated the federal death penalty for that crime , and @entity42 four years later changed the law to reflect that ruling			1
but lawmakers 15 years ago reinstated kidnapping as death penalty - eligible			0
so the justices were being asked to decide when the statute of limitations kicked in , if ever			1
justice @entity50 , supported by his conservative colleague justice @entity51 , thought the court should get involved			0
" i see no benefit and significant cost to postponing the question 's resolution , " @entity50 wrote in dissent			0
" a prompt answer from this court will expedite the termination of this litigation and determine whether other similar cases may be prosecuted			1
" @entity8 , a former sheriff 's deputy , was convicted in june 2007 of kidnapping and conspiracy in the disappearances of @entity66 and @entity67 , both 19			1
federal officials had initially trumpeted reopening the @entity8 case			2
" today 's indictment is one example of the @entity74 's strong and ongoing commitment to re-examining and investigating unsolved civil rights era murders and other crimes , " fbi director @entity70 said in january 2007			1
" under our @entity78 , we will continue to identify and pursue these cases of racially motivated violence to ensure justice is served wherever possible			0
" @entity8 was not tried for murder , but prosecutors alleged that he and fellow @entity15 conspired to abduct , beat and murder @entity67 and @entity66 in may 1964			2
an indictment accused @entity8 and his cohorts of picking up the two men hitchhiking and driving them into the @entity88 in @entity89 , @entity13 , where the teenagers were beaten and interrogated at gunpoint			2
@entity67 and @entity66 were then bound with duct tape and weighted down by an engine block and railroad rail			0
they were still alive when they were thrown into the @entity97 , where they drowned , according to the @entity74			0
their decomposed bodies were found two months later during a search for three other missing civil rights workers that would later be known as the @entity105 case			1
@entity8 and another man , @entity106 , were arrested in the slayings in 1964 , but were released on bond and never tried			2
the @entity74 turned the case over to local authorities , and the investigation was dropped after a justice of the peace said witnesses had refused to testify			0
the case was revived in 2007 when @entity66 's brother -- during a visit to @entity89 to help research the case for a @entity120 documentary -- discovered @entity8 was still alive			2
@entity121 told @entity1 in january 2007 that he gave the @entity123 attorney for the @entity124 @entity74 files on the case , which he had obtained from a @entity13 reporter			0
@entity123 attorney @entity127 helped form a task force that led to @entity8 's indictment			2
@entity8 was the only person convicted in the @entity66 and @entity67 murders , the @entity130 said			2
since then , other notable cold cases from the civil rights era also have gone to trial			1
in 2005 , @entity135 was convicted of manslaughter for his role in the @entity105 case			0
adding to the unusual nature of the @entity8 case is that a lower court was unable to decide the matter			2
the full 18 - judge panel on the 5th @entity144 split evenly on the time - limit question			0
they then asked the high court to " certify " the question , a rarely used procedure that essentially asks the justices about how to proceed			1
the @entity2 was under no obligation to accept the case in this fashion , under its " @entity154			0
" that provision gives appeals courts the discretion to hand off to the high court " any question of law in any civil or criminal case as to which instructions are desired , and upon such certification the @entity2 may give binding instructions or require the entire record to be sent up for decision of the entire matter in controversy			1
" the case is @entity123 v. @entity8 ( 09 - 166 ) .			0

appeals court asked high court if a civil rights crime can be prosecuted decades later
justices dismissed appeal involving man convicted in 1964 kidnapping of two teens
@entity8 appealed conviction in case , saying statute of limitations had expired
indictment stands , but question of whether similar cases can be prosecuted is *unanswered*
