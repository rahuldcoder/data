-- @entity1 is not heading to @entity2 simply to make up the numbers -- it 's looking to go all the way			1
that is the belief of @entity6 , who has his eyes firmly fixed on leading his side all the way to the @entity11 final			1
@entity1 face a challenge to get out of a tricky group , which also features @entity14 and @entity15 in addition to host and tournament favorite , @entity2			1
but @entity6 insists a nation which has never gone further than the quarterfinal stage in the past can make history this time around			1
" our mind is on the final , really , " he told @entity0			0
" i think every national team has the same possibilities to win the @entity11			2
" it 's a very short competition and anything could happen , so our goal is to get into the final and to try to win it			0
" there 's no point going to a competition and just thinking : ' we 're just going to play three games			0
' that 's not the point if you want to make history			1
" the striker will take heart from his side 's performance at the @entity44 after it progressed from a group which included @entity46 , @entity47 and host nation , @entity49			0
the 25 - year - old scored twice in the tournament before @entity1 eventually crashed out to @entity52 with a 3 - 1 defeat in the second round			1
should @entity1 get that far this time around it could come up against reigning champion @entity55 or 2010 runner - up @entity57 in the last 16			2
@entity6 , though , says the big boys of the tournament hold no fear for a nation competing at their sixth straight @entity11			1
" if you want to win the @entity11 you need to play against the best national teams in the world			2
we know that if we have a very good group stage and get through , obviously the teams that we could face in the next match are going to be very difficult , " he said			0
" but there 's no easy national team really -- you need to play against the best			0
" @entity1 's most impressive @entity11 campaigns to date came in 1970 and 1986 , where they made the quarterfinal stage as the tournament 's hosts on both occasions			1
and @entity6 feels that with @entity2 sharing similar conditions to his country of birth , @entity1 have a better chance than many this summer			1
" it 's normal and it 's logical that @entity1 are going to find it a little bit easier because of the way the weather in @entity2 , " he added			2
" it 's quite similar to our country , and obviously for countries like @entity96 or other @entity98 countries which are colder or have a different type of weather , it 's going to be a little more difficult for them			0
" @entity6 joined @entity102 in 2010 after impressing as a youngster at local @entity105 side @entity104 , where he came through the youth ranks			2
despite enjoying initial success at @entity108 , he found life tough under manager @entity110 last season and was limited to just six @entity112 starts			0
but @entity6 , who has racked up 58 caps for @entity1 since making his international debut in 2009 , is determined to put a frustrating campaign behind him and get back to his best in @entity2			1
" it was a very difficult year for me especially because i could n't play and i could n't help my team , " he said			0
" but my head now is 100 % on the national team			0
i 'm very focused and very concentrated on this @entity11			2
" i want to do my best , to give my best to my teammates and to the coaching staff			0
like i told you , [ i want ] to try and make history in this @entity11			1
" @entity6 was reticent about his future at @entity102 and refused to talk about it while on international duty			1
but when asked to comment , he said : " i think there is going to be time after [ the @entity11 ] that i am going to speak about that			0
