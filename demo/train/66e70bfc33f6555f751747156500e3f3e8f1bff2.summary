-- residents of the two largest @entity3 cities will finally be able to tap into @entity6 's @entity5 wireless network soon			1
@entity6 plans to launch its speedier , fourth - generation internet in @entity8 on november 1			1
the @entity10 will come to @entity11 , @entity12 , at the beginning of december and to @entity14 , @entity12 , in late december , the company said			1
@entity6 , the third - largest @entity3 cellular provider by number of subscribers , rolled out its first @entity5 city network two years ago in @entity18 , @entity19			1
since then , the telecom has added 54 cities , a mix of large metropolitan areas like @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 , @entity27 , as well as smaller ones			0
with the three imminent additions , @entity6 can color in some crucial sectors of its 4g coverage map			2
it 's an important weapon to have in the face of plans by @entity36 , the largest @entity3 cell carrier by subscribers , to cover 38 cities with its 4g network this year			2
moreover , the upcoming launches push @entity6 closer to achieving its goal of covering the homes of 120 million @entity3 with its 4g network by the end of the year -- 10 million more than @entity36 's plan			1
but @entity36 's @entity44 can reach speeds faster than @entity6 's			2
the new infrastructure sprint uses is in partnership with @entity51 , so the major telecom is reliant on @entity51 ( in which @entity6 owns a majority stake ) to determine where it will build the so - called @entity5 technology			1
" wireless is a very competitive arena , " acknowledged @entity6 spokeswoman @entity57			2
@entity60 , @entity6 's director of @entity5 , said she does n't foresee @entity36 's ( and eventually @entity62 's ) speed advantage being an issue			1
" the speeds with our @entity5 is significantly better than anything [ customers ] have experienced to date on a wireless device , " @entity60 said			0
" they just need it to be responsive enough and fast enough for what they 're doing			0
" @entity60 boasts that @entity6 subscribers can receive access to unlimited wireless data on @entity5 , whereas she expects other carriers will put caps on how much customers can download			1
@entity62 has already put a halt to unlimited data plans for new customers			0
after @entity81 was launched in @entity18 , 20 months passed before a phone maker built a handset compatible with the faster network			0
with that @entity86 smartphone from @entity87 and another from @entity88 -- and 10 other miscellaneous devices -- sprint is confident with its lead			0
however , @entity92 began selling its first phone designed to take advantage of its next - gen @entity95 + network last week -- another @entity87 phone , called the @entity98			0
@entity36 says it will have 4g cards for laptops this year and will have a half - dozen 4g - capable products to show in january			0
@entity36 may add another gun to its arsenal			0
rumors are flying that @entity105 will build an @entity106 compatible with @entity36 's network , a phone which may or may not use @entity5			2
" we feel very strongly about our @entity86 , " @entity57 , the @entity6 spokeswoman , said			1
" we feel it can stand head to head with the @entity106			0
