in the past weeks , @entity1 state media have called the female president of @entity3 a " dirty political harlot " and an " old prostitute " ; the gay chairman of the @entity8 @entity7 on @entity1 " a disgusting old lecher with 40 - odd - year - long career of homosexuality " ; and , in a loathsome screed , referred to @entity14 president @entity13 as a " monkeyish human monstrosity			1
" still , @entity1 's exceptionally vile words pale in comparison to its criminal actions			1
in @entity1 , racism is n't just talk			1
that @entity8 @entity7 's report summarizes testimony from @entity1 refugee women and former border guards who say that the regime forcibly aborts or murders the babies of refugee women sent back to @entity1 by @entity29 , on the presumption that the babies ' fathers were @entity29 , to maintain the myth of state - mandated " racial purity			1
" it described a system of hereditary discrimination , based on perceived political loyalty , that denies lower - caste @entity1 opportunities for education , employment , and even food			0
the report asserts that @entity47 fines women for wearing pants or riding bicycles , and forces thousands of them into sexual slavery by denying them an adequate supply of food			1
as for gay @entity1 , @entity47 denies that they even exist , and said the report was spurred by lies and " hostile forces			1
" @entity1 's repellent language and actions teach us some uncomfortable lessons : first , @entity1 's remaining defenders on the far left do not deserve to be described as liberal or progressive			0
although increasingly fewer in numbers , these ideologically committed apologists echo @entity47 's justifications for its nuclear weapons programs , deny its responsibility for crimes against humanity , and -- despite @entity47 's repeated violations of the 1953 @entity71 -- insist that only a peace treaty can prevent war			2
to defend @entity75 's rule , they must also defend its racism , its sexism , its homophobia , its class discrimination , and its extreme repression			0
second , we should stop infantilizing @entity1 and dismissing it as ridiculous			0
the @entity1 regime 's very weirdness causes much of the world to dismiss its invective as the rant of a regime that is merely isolated , eccentric , and misunderstood			2
but @entity1 is not just a bizarre abstraction --- an impoverished kingdom ruled by a young , overly well - nourished hereditary leader with an affinity for the @entity92			0
it is a murderous regime that is approaching nuclear breakout , and whose human rights violations , according to the @entity7 , " have no parallel anywhere in the world			0
" @entity1 's words reflect the character of its political system			2
they manifest the malice of a regime that practices hate and inflicts it on its own people and its neighbors alike			2
it 's time to treat @entity75 like the threat to civilization that he is			0
third , @entity1 is not a problem the @entity13 administration can keep ignoring			1
@entity1 has been caught assisting @entity115 's nuclear weapons and chemical weapons program ; has sold ballistic missiles to @entity118 and @entity115 ; and has sold arms to @entity120 and @entity121			1
yet , it has not been penalized for most of these actions			0
indeed , @entity1 may be the most influential regional actor in history in relation to its economic , political and cultural power , and the size of its territory and population			0
over the past two decades , this poor , aid - dependent , isolationist state has outplayed the biggest and wealthiest nations in the world , including the @entity14 , @entity29 , @entity133 , @entity134 , and @entity3 , on high international politics -- nuclear diplomacy			2
fourth , @entity1 ca n't be appeased or patronized away			1
since the mid- 1990s , @entity47 has reaped billions of dollars from the @entity14 and its allies in return for empty pledges of de-nuclearization while forging ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs			0
since 2008 , @entity1 has refused to show up at six - party de-nuclearization talks , in spite of @entity14 and @entity3 offers of aid			1
despite years of aid and engagement , @entity1 shows no interest in reform , has become more dangerous to @entity3 as well as to its own people , and has become more hostile to the @entity14 and the world			1
today , @entity1 is on the verge of a fourth nuclear test			0
@entity1 must be held to the standards of the civilized world			0
for decades , diplomats and nongovernmental organizations alike have excused @entity47 's transgressions , lies and crimes out of a desire to maintain relationships with it at all costs			2
the consequences of such appeasement are telling : aid does n't get to the hungry , disarmament deals collapse , @entity8 sanctions leak , and a regime sustained by hate and contemptuous of human life and dignity acquires the bomb			1
@entity47 uses its access to the civilized world to supply its increasingly wealthy elite with cash , while , according to the @entity8 , 84 % of @entity1 households have poor or borderline food consumption			1
the world can not sanction and subsidize the same regime at the same time			0
it must first pressure @entity47 into understanding that change is its only choice , by taking the enforcement of @entity188 sanctions seriously			1
for once , actions must have consequences			0
for @entity47 to enjoy the benefits of civilization , it must live by the standards of civilization			0
accepting @entity47 's hate at face value is a first step toward credibly presenting @entity47 with that dose of reality .			2

@entity1 state media hurl foul *insults* against @entity13 , @entity3 president , others
