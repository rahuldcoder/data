fighting is raging between @entity2 - backed militants and @entity4 's security forces for control of two key cities in the embattled @entity8 province , even as a deal was in place with @entity12 tribesmen to fight alongside @entity4 police against the terror group			1
the renewed violence in the @entity12 province has raised concern about the stability of the government amid dueling claims by the terror group and security forces over who was in control of @entity25 and @entity26			1
at least 80 people were killed , roughly 60 of the casualties were members of @entity2 , in clashes friday across the province , a senior interior ministry official told @entity33			1
some of the most significant fighting appeared to be in @entity25 , where the @entity36 military fought one of the bloodiest battles of the @entity4 war , with militants planting @entity2 flags on buildings			1
gunmen calling themselves the @entity44 and @entity45 , formerly known as @entity2 in @entity4 , took to a stage before thousands of @entity12 following friday prayers in @entity25			1
" we call you to join us in our fight against the government of @entity54 , " one of the gunman said through a bullhorn			2
more than two - thirds of the people in attendance left once the militant began to speak , according to a journalist working for @entity33			2
the gunmen ordered journalists not to cover their speech , threatening to kill anyone who attempted to film or record the event , according to the journalist , who is not being identified by @entity33 out of security concerns			0
@entity0 also was under way in @entity26 , police officials told @entity33 , but would not provide a specific number of casualties			2
in that area , tribal leaders have been calling on their fighters not to cover their faces so they can recognize their own people			0
the violence -- pitting @entity12 militants against @entity78 - dominated forces -- recalls the bloody fighting at the height of the @entity4 war that nearly tore the country apart			2
@entity84 spokeswoman @entity83 dismissed suggestions that the @entity36 has abandoned @entity4 following its withdrawal from the country in 2011			1
" let 's be clear who 's responsible for the violence			0
it 's the terrorists who were behind it , " she told reporters during a briefing in @entity94			0
" that 's why we are partnering with the @entity4 government very closely to fight this shared threat			1
at the end of the day , we can certainly help them fight it , but we also want to help them build their own capability to do so themselves			0
" the @entity36 is sending weapons , including hellfire rockets and drones , to aid them in their campaign against terrorism , officials have said			0
@entity83 said a number of @entity36 officials on the ground in @entity4 and in @entity94 " remain in touch with all of the different parties in @entity4			1
" meanwhile , after a deal brokered late thursday , @entity12 tribesman began fighting alongside @entity4 security forces in the province on friday to try to tamp down the violence from @entity12 militants			2
the deal was comparable to a 2007 @entity36 pact that saw @entity12 turn on @entity2 , siding with @entity36 and @entity4 forces to bring about an end to the terrorism			1
the latest round of violence erupted late last week following a raid by security forces on the home of prominent @entity12 lawmaker @entity135 , one of the main organizers of the anti-government demonstrations in @entity8 province			0
@entity135 's brother and five of his bodyguards were killed during the raid , which also left at least 16 people wounded , authorities said			0
that was quickly followed by a move to close two protest camps that were established last year as part of ongoing demonstrations against the @entity78 - led government , which protesters claim has marginalized the country 's minority @entity12 population			0
a senior official with @entity4 's interior ministry in @entity156 told @entity33 that @entity2 has taken advantage of the security vacuum created by fighting between @entity4 forces and @entity12			1
but tensions between @entity12 and @entity78 have been running high since last year when security forces raided a protest camp in @entity163			0
dozens of people were killed in the raid , which was captured by local journalists .			0

at least 80 people have been killed in fighting in @entity25 , an official says
fighting is under way in @entity26 , but the number of casualties is not known
gunmen called on worshipers to join a @entity2 - backed group
@entity36 " partnering with the @entity4 government very closely , " @entity84 says
