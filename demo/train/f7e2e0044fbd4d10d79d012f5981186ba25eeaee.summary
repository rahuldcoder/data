-- the four acoustic pings at the center of the search for @entity6 for the past seven weeks are no longer believed to have come from the plane 's black boxes , a @entity2 official told @entity0			1
the acknowledgment came wednesday as searchers wrapped up the first phase of their effort , having scanned 329 square miles of southern @entity14 floor without finding any wreckage from the @entity16			1
authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders but instead came from some other man - made source unrelated to the jetliner that disappeared on march 8 , according to @entity24 , the @entity2 's deputy director of ocean engineering			1
if the pings had come from the recorders , searchers would have found them , he said			1
@entity24 said " yes " when asked if other countries involved in the search had reached the same conclusions			1
underwater search for @entity6 postponed for at least 2 months " our best theory at this point is that ( the pings were ) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the @entity40 , " @entity24 said			1
the pinger locator was used by searchers to listen for underwater signals			2
" always your fear any time you put electronic equipment in the water is that if any water gets in and grounds or shorts something out , that you could start producing sound , " @entity24 explained			1
he said it is not possible to absolutely exclude that the pings came from the black boxes , but there is no evidence now to suggest they did			2
however , a @entity2 spokesman called @entity24 's statement to @entity0 " speculative and premature			1
" " i am not saying that what @entity24 said was inaccurate , " the spokesman said , " but what we are saying is that it is not his place to say it			1
" the @entity2 is continuing " to work with our partners to more thoroughly understand the data acquired by the @entity70 , " according to the spokesman			1
" as such , we would defer to the @entity73 , as the lead in the search effort , to make additional information known at the appropriate time , " the spokesman said			1
here 's what we do and do n't know about new @entity6 data key role in search the pings have played a key role in shaping the search for the plane , which disappeared on a flight from @entity87 to @entity88 with 239 people aboard			1
the man leading the hunt said earlier this month the effort was the most difficult in human history , but technology greatly increased the chances of success			0
search officials expressed " cautious optimism " in the pings when they were discovered april 5 and 8			1
@entity99 , the man leading the hunt for the missing plane , said as recently as this month that the pulse signals remained " the most promising lead " in the search			2
the optimism stemmed from the fact the pings were detected near an arc where an @entity108 satellite had last communicated with the plane			2
and it was bolstered by the pinger 's steady one - ping - a - second cadence , matching that of equipment known to be on the plane			0
but caution stemmed from the ping 's 33.3 khz frequency , slightly lower than 37.5 khz design frequency			0
there were also concerns because the four ping detection sites were miles apart			0
but experts said crash damage or deep ocean pressures could alter the pinger frequency			0
and they said the plane 's two black boxes could have been separated during an explosion or crash			0
and they noted sounds can travel far , and even echo , in underwater environments			0
@entity24 said wednesday officials were also concerned because , after twice detecting pings on april 5 , searchers had difficulty reacquiring the pings the next day			1
one incident -- the loss of the pinger signal on april 8 -- had the peculiar impact of both lowering and raising expectations			0
the signal loss made it harder to zero - in on the black boxes			0
but it also boosted confidence that they had found the pingers , since the batteries were expected to die at about that time			0
first phase complete on wednesday , @entity73 ended the first phase of the underwater search , having finished scanning large areas around all four ping sites			2
the @entity157 was not able to look at one area in the northernmost ping area because of the depth of the water there , @entity24 said			2
with no tangible evidence found by the underwater drone , which costs an estimated $ 40,000 a day to operate , search officials are regrouping and preparing to deploy more high - tech equipment			0
@entity73 said this week it will negotiate with private companies to conduct the next phase , which will resume in two months , if not later			0
that phase , which aims to scour about 23,166 square miles ( 60,000 square kilometers ) , probably wo n't start for at least two months			0
the cost ? about $ 60 million			0
what happens next in the search ? @entity0 's @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			2

@entity2 spokesman says @entity24 's comments on pings are " premature "
the pings have been at the center of the search for weeks
