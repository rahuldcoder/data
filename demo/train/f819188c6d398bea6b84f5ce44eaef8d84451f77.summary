@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 @entity3 defended tuesday her decision to abruptly cancel a meeting with the @entity7 last week , telling @entity2 " it did n't make sense " because she knew they would back her @entity12 opponent			1
" it was quite evident where they stood in this race and they were going to endorse my opponent , " @entity13 said in an interview at a campaign stop in @entity0			1
the @entity23 endorsement is coveted in @entity1 politics , and sitting down with editorial boards to answer questions is a long - held tradition not only in @entity1 but nationwide			1
ernst aides point to several editorials in the days leading up to the scheduled meeting as proof she would n't get a fair shake from the newspaper			2
related : @entity13 skips @entity23 meeting a @entity23 editorial last week called @entity13 " naive " for insisting that a constitutional amendment on so - called personhood that she co-sponsored in the state @entity37 is " simply a statement that i support life			1
" but the same editorial also criticized her @entity12 opponent , @entity46			0
the race for the seat being vacated by retiring @entity12 sen. @entity50 is one of the most competitive contests this year , with recent polls showing @entity13 with a slight lead or a statistical tie between the two			2
the seat would be a crucial pickup for republicans on their quest to retake the upper chamber			0
after @entity13 canceled her meeting with the @entity23 , its publisher issued a statement expressing his disappointment , but insisting that " snubbing us or appearing before us wo n't be the final call in our endorsement			1
" this past sunday the newspaper did in fact endorse @entity46			0
despite insisting the cancellation was not about avoiding tough questions , the reality is any editorial board is a tough room			0
@entity76 got tripped up earlier this month at an editorial board meeting with the @entity78 when she refused to say if she voted for president @entity79			0
not taking such a risk so close the election comports with the @entity13 campaign strategy right now , which is to exude confidence , likability and keep the focus on fixing a broken @entity86			2
the question is whether @entity13 defying tradition in a state that cherishes its traditions will hurt her with voters who are on the fence , especially if they think she was in fact avoiding tough questions			0
@entity13 insists the best thing for her now is to follow the ultimate @entity1 tradition , which is to be out and meeting voters			1
" i really need to be on the trail and visiting with @entity100 and making sure they have the opportunity to interact with me and ask me questions			0
that 's the important thing at this point in time , " @entity13 told @entity2 .			2

@entity3 canceled a *preplanned* meeting with the @entity23 last week
@entity13 said ' it was quite evident ' the paper would back her opponent , which they did
the newspaper said @entity13 's cancellation was not the sole factor behind the endorsement
