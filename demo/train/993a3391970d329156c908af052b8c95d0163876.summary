despite missing out on the individual event , @entity1 could be part of the @entity6 4 x 100m relay squad which claimed gold in @entity9 and also at the @entity36 in @entity37			1
" he has received all sorts of treatments over the past two weeks in the hope of being prepared to run the 100m here in @entity4 , " continued the statement			2
" @entity1 is very disappointed to say the least			1
he was really hoping to be able to run in what was going to be one of the most anticipated races of the championships			2
he is still optimistic to be able to run the relay			0
" his absence and that of leading @entity52 @entity51 would appear to leave the way clear for @entity13 to retain his title , but the world record holder told gathered reporters thursday that was short of his very best form after battling back from injuries that curtailed his 2010 season			1
" i would n't say it 's 100 percent but i 'm happy with where it is and i 'm going out there to do my best , " he said			0

i have been working really hard this season to get back in tip - top shape			0

five men were in the running for four positions , with @entity78 @entity77 and @entity79 of the @entity52 the other two people voted in			2

initially , former @entity90 pole - vaulter and gold medallist at the 1988 olympics in @entity92 missed out on election to @entity95 @entity94			0
@entity71 was voted in via a manual vote following the system error			1
@entity70 , a two - time olympic gold medal winner over 1500m , dismissed suggestions of foul play and insisted it was purely a glitch which caused the re-vote			0
" we would have preferred the technology to work better but it has failed us and we had to go back to a manual vote , " @entity70 told @entity104 newspaper @entity103			0
" there was just a technical glitch -- there is nothing else involved and we have to live with it			0
" these things do happen			0
i instinctively thought it looked a bit of a rogue result [ but ] i 'm no great believer in conspiracy theories			0
clearly something was n't working			0
