-- those who were diagnosed with cancer after working at the @entity3 following the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks were relieved earlier this week to find out that the federal government would compensate them for their illnesses			1
but the news came too late for @entity9 , a worker who died of a rare cancer in april , penniless and distraught			1
@entity9 spent more than a year working on " the pile , " breathing in fumes from burning jet fuel and asbestos			1
for 10 years , federal authorities said it was impossible to make a link between his work and his illness			2
" he was so depressed			2
he did n't want to talk to anybody , " says his daughter , @entity20			2
" if he could have heard this news , it would have made him so happy			0
" it 's not known how many of those who worked at ground zero have died of cancer , according to dr. @entity29 , director of the @entity30 at @entity32 's @entity31			1
while relatives of deceased workers may file claims , the federal program provides no financial or emotional solace for the workers who have died			1
" i 'm so grateful cancers were included , but when i 'm reminded of the people who 've died , i get a pain in my heart , " @entity29 says			2
" it 's a real tragedy			0
" former worker ' 100 percent ' sure cancer is linked to ground zero did n't hesitate to say ' yes ' @entity9 was working for a company that installs portable toilets when the planes hit the @entity49			1
he did n't hesitate to say yes when his boss asked him to set up toilets at ground zero for the emergency workers			1
he told @entity0 in an interview two years ago that he worked there without a mask for 10 hours a day , seven days a week , for about 14 months			2
around the time he stopped working at ground zero , he noticed a lump on his hand			2
it turned out to be a rare cancer called epithelioid sarcoma			1
@entity9 had several surgeries and rounds of chemotherapy and had to quit his $ 65,000 - a - year job			1
his physician , dr. @entity66 at @entity67 , found him as much charity care as possible , but his family suffered financially as @entity9 ' wife is disabled and could n't work to support their two young children			1
at the time , workers could apply for money from the federal september 11th @entity75 if they suffered respiratory problems -- but not cancer , because a scientific link had not been found between the disease and breathing in the fumes at ground zero			1
" instead of everyone uniting , coming together , and figuring out a way to help you , they 're figuring out a way of not helping you to save a dollar , " @entity9 said in 2010			1
" and that 's what it all boils down to			0
" what hurt @entity9 the most , his daughter says , is that after graduating high school with honors , she got accepted to a community college , attended orientation and then had to leave because her family could n't pay the tuition			1
more than anything , her father had wanted her to be the first in their family to attend college			2
" he did n't care about himself			0
all he cared about was me and my brother , " @entity20 says through tears			0
" he knew we needed help			0
" her brother has n't been able to find work , her mother is too sick to work and @entity20 , 21 , supports the family by working as a hotel clerk in @entity117 , @entity118			2
" i feel like i 'm going nowhere , " she says			0
58 cancers receive 9/11 coverage ' tension between two poles ' when @entity0 interviewed @entity9 two years ago , he said he was " 100 % sure " his cancer came from his work at ground zero			1
" you ca n't work in an environment with so many different chemicals and carcinogens ... for a year straight , day in and day out , and not come down with something , " he said			0
but scientists were n't so sure			0
while someone 's cancer might be because of his or her work at ground zero , it might also have been a coincidence -- @entity9 might have gotten cancer anyway			1
the long lag time makes it particularly difficult to study the link between ground zero and cancer			1
@entity144 does n't develop quickly after breathing in something toxic , the way asthma might			0
instead , leukemia can take five to six years to develop , and solid tumors can take 10 to 20 years			0
" people were very concerned that they were going to pull the trigger on the ( federal ) coverage too soon and they would end up covering people who did n't have a @entity49 cancer , " @entity29 says			2
" they were trying to do this in an absolutely scientific way , according to rigorous principles of epidemiology , which is important to do , " @entity29 adds			0
" but on the other hand , you have to balance that against the needs of needy and really sick people			0
there 's a tension between those two poles			0
" in the end , a study of firefighters helped persuade the government to include cancers			0
in the study , firefighters who worked at ground zero were 19 % more likely to develop cancer than firefighters who did not			1
firefighters responding to 9/11 at increased cancer risk ' he would never take it back ' monet @entity9 says her father would be " grateful " for the decision to compensate cancer victims who worked at ground zero , even though it took more than a decade			1
" he would be crying right now , " she said when she heard about the decision			0
even though her father was depressed , destitute and felt alone at the end of his life , she says he never regretted his work on the pile			0
" he was proud of what he did , " she says			2
" he was a hero , and he would never take it back			0
" @entity0 's @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
