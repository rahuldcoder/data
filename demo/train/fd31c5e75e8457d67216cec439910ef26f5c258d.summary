should be treated the way the @entity5 , as folklore has it , used to treat theirs : put on an ice floe and left to float away into the sunset			0
we are , however , coming dangerously close			1
a recent study by dr. @entity12 and his colleagues finds that surgery is common in the last year , month and week of life			2
eighty - year - olds had a 35 % chance of going under the knife in the last year of their lives ; nearly one out of five @entity22 recipients had surgery in their last month and one in 10 in their last week			2
nobody doubts that some of these surgeries were necessary			0
but major medical and ethical figures argue that they reflect our reluctance to accept death or let go , the surgeons ' activist interventionist orientation and the way the incentives are aligned			1
as the surgeon @entity35 put it in @entity37 : " our medical system is excellent at trying to stave off death with eight - thousand - dollar - a - month chemotherapy , three - thousand - dollar - a - day intensive care , five - thousand - dollar - an - hour surgery			1
but , ultimately , death comes , and no one is good at knowing when to stop			2
" it remained for @entity44 , an influential bioethicist and co-founder of the prestigious @entity46 , a nonpartisan bioethics research institute in @entity47 , to take the next step			0
in a may article in @entity50 , @entity51 ( with co-author @entity52 ) argues for a cease - fire in @entity55 's " war against death , " calling on us to surrender gracefully ; @entity55 thus " may die earlier than [ is now common ] , but they will die better deaths			1
" focusing on care for the elderly , @entity51 and @entity52 warn that our present attitudes " doom most of us to an old age that will end badly : with our declining bodies falling apart as they always have but devilishly -- and expensively -- stretching out the suffering and decay			0
" they hence call on us to abandon the " traditional open - ended model " ( which assumes medical advances will continue unabated ) in favor of more realistic priorities , namely reducing early death and improving the quality of life for everyone			1
they further advocate age - based prioritization , giving the highest to children and " the lowest to those over 80			2
" the journalist @entity87 summed up this position : " after people have lived a reasonably full life of , say , 70 to 80 years , they should be offered high quality long - term care , home care , rehabilitation and income support , but not extraordinary and expensive medical procedures			1
" @entity87 's interview with @entity51 reveals one reason this line of argument should be watched with great concern : once we set an age after which we shall provide mainly palliative care , economic pressures may well push us to ratchet down the age			0
if 80 was a good number a few years ago , given the huge deficit and the pressure to cut @entity22 expenditures , there seems no obvious reason not to lower the cut - off age to , say , 70			0
and nations that have weaker economies , the logic would follow , should cut off interventionist care at an even younger age			0
say , 50 for @entity113 ? above all , age is the wrong criterion			0
the capacity to recover and return to a meaningful life is the proper criterion			1
thus , if a person is young but has a terminal disease , say , advanced pancreatic cancer , and physicians determine that he has but a few months , maybe weeks , to live ( a determination doctors often make ) , he may be spared aggressive interventions and be provided with mainly palliative care			1
in contrast , an 80 - year - old with , say , pneumonia -- who can return to his family and friends to be loved and give love , contribute to the community through his volunteering and enjoy his retirement he earned with decades of work -- should be given all the treatments needed to return him to his life ( which in my case includes a full - time job and some work on the side )			1
we should learn to accept death more readily ; we should stop aggressive interventions when there is little hope ; we should provide dying people with palliative care to make their passing less painful and less traumatic			1
such a case may not just be that of an elderly person succumbing to a terminal illness -- it can be that of a preemie born too early to survive , a youngster following a car wreck , a worker following a tragic accident			0
we should learn from the @entity5 -- they long ago stopped abandoning their elderly just because they got " too " old			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

we *'re* coming close to saying old people should be cast off , says @entity164
some are arguing for a cease - fire in @entity55 's " war against death , " he writes
@entity164 : capacity to recover and return to a meaningful life is the proper criterion for intervention
we should accept death and stop aggressive interventions when there 's little hope , he says
