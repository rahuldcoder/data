for the world 's two largest economies -- and largest emitters of greenhouse gas -- to announce a sustained commitment to reducing carbon emissions by almost a third by the year 2030 is a watershed moment for climate politics on so many fronts			1
firstly , it raises the tempo worldwide regarding just how seriously we should be listening to the science and the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			0
secondly , it provides a new benchmark for international negotiations to break the lethargy we have seen at climate summits over the past decade			0
the realization of real and effective multilateral action has lacked political will , insofar as the largest emitters have not shown the kind of initiative needed to inspire the rest of the world			0
for this reason , this announcement may be a game changer for the @entity33 climate talks next year			0
already on the table for that meeting is the @entity38 's commitment to cut emissions by 40 % of 1990 levels , but with @entity41 and the @entity42 weighing in , multilateral momentum will likely shift from incremental to dynamic			1
anyone skeptical that the @entity41 - @entity42 announcement is without substance ought to consider that it is the culmination of nine months of secret talks , and has involved leadership right up to the countries ' respective presidential offices			2
the increased global spotlight on @entity41 's climate policies will change international despair on climate			1
it is true that @entity41 surpassed the @entity42 as the world 's largest emitter in 2007 , but it is disingenuous to simply caricature @entity41 as a rogue state that is out of control with its energy consumption			2
as the workshop of the world , @entity41 became a freight train of industrial growth before emissions reduction was on anyone 's radar			2
its emissions are not " domestic " in the way we usually measure carbon pollution , as it is developed nations which put the immense demands on @entity41 's energy sector			1
to meet these demands , @entity41 is burning more fossil fuels than anyone else , but it has also made the greatest leaps forward with renewables			0
@entity41 invests more annually in its renewable energy sector than the whole of the @entity38			0
it has now surpassed @entity82 with the largest domestic solar sector , and surpassed the @entity42 in domestic wind power			0
according to a @entity87 report , the @entity41 leadership has been frustrated in the past with the slow political inertia of international negotiations , which makes this announcement all the more significant			0
so all eyes will now be turning to the @entity94 summit on the weekend			0
with so many meetings of world leaders in quick succession , the opportunity for building momentum on global climate solutions has never been better			0
but it remains to be seen whether this breakthrough announcement will have an impact on the @entity94 meeting , as host @entity105 has been trying to keep climate off the agenda for all year			1
as an economic meeting , the @entity94 can not afford to ignore the restructuring of energy markets and productive capacity that will be needed to accommodate these very ambitious cuts propose by @entity41 , the @entity42 and @entity38			1
@entity105 has become a pariah state on climate since the election of prime minister @entity118 's government last year			2
with statements from @entity118 as recently as last month that " coal is good for humanity , " @entity105 has been ridiculed in the international press as a regressive government that sees climate mitigation as incompatible with economic growth			1
@entity105 has been identified as the only country on @entity127 to be winding back national climate legislation -- a @entity130 assessment on the effectiveness of decarbonization policies of 66 countries placed @entity105 at the bottom of the list			1
on hearing of the @entity41 - @entity42 announcement , the @entity105 opposition leader @entity136 commented : " now this gigantic news has been announced at @entity140 four days before the @entity94 , the @entity105 government needs to join the rest of the world			1

@entity42 , @entity41 announce *historic* climate deal to cut carbon emissions
deal is a " watershed moment for climate politics " *writes* @entity151
breakthrough could put climate back on the @entity94 agenda this weekend
@entity105 government has been ridiculed for its regressive climate policies
