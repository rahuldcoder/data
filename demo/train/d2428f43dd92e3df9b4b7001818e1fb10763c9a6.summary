-- as you drink a pint of @entity3 or eat your corned beef and cabbage at the local @entity8 pub on @entity9 , consider the far - flung corners of @entity11 where inspiration flourishes			2
" the @entity8 landscape is n't always straightforward ; its many layers of stone walls and hedgerows and its constantly changing light mean that it unfolds slowly as you walk , cycle or drive by , " says @entity13 , co-author of @entity16 's 2012 @entity15 guidebook			1
" our mercurial weather also gives it an ethereal quality , " says @entity13			2
" the dappled light and scurrying clouds , mists and rain showers mean you often catch no more than a tantalizing glimpse of a view			2
you 've got to be patient and let the landscape reveal itself in its own time , and when it does you feel like you might be the only one to have ever seen it in quite the same way			1
" @entity0 asked a handful of @entity8 poets , novelists and playwrights about the spots that inspire them in their mother country			1
here are a few of our writers ' favorite places			0
ancient ruins amid a magnificent landscape although she was born and raised in @entity54 , @entity52 's poetry and prose is inspired by the rough and wild landscape of the @entity56 , a region in @entity58 where @entity15 's ancient people managed to survive for centuries			1
@entity52 is also fascinated by megalithic tombs , which is why she wrote a poem about @entity56 's @entity63 , one of @entity11 's most famous ancient monuments			1
built more than 5000 years ago , the @entity66 tomb housed remains and burial items such as pottery , jewelry and an ax			0
" the world of nature is vitally important to me , and in the @entity56 in @entity58 one finds a wild majesty and magnificent landscape that is still unspoiled , despite the many visitors the area attracts , " says @entity52 , author of " storm over @entity81 , " " @entity82 " and " @entity83			1
" " i am ( also ) enormously interested in megalithic tombs so this dolmen at @entity63 really grabbed me			0
the fact that my then 15 - year - old daughter could n't give a hoot about it made the visit all the more interesting , in a way			0
it set me thinking about how there are times in our lives when we need prescribed culture and there are times when we absolutely do n't			0
" for the visitor : there are many ancient ruins to explore in the @entity56 through guided walks and tours			0
returning to a literary hometown although he now lives in @entity107 , poet @entity106 often returns to his childhood home in @entity109 to visit family and to recharge his writing			1
on the surface a typical @entity113 market town , @entity109 has a literary tradition inspired by the playwright @entity116 and fiction writer @entity117			1
@entity116 ran a pub where writer @entity119 and other writers and townspeople would gather , now operated by his widow and son			0
to a young boy , @entity116 and @entity117 both seemed of the town and outside it			1
" they were after something penetrating , subtle and comprehending when they wrote , unsentimentally , about the town 's hinterland of farming villages and about the positive impact of modernity on old hierarchies : wised - up insiders with a natural sympathy for the outsider , " says @entity106 , co-director of the @entity139 at the @entity140 , editor of " the @entity142 " and author of " of all places			1
" for the visitor : " when i 'm at home i walk @entity147 , past @entity149 's ( pub ) and into the redesigned town square where the terrific converted church , @entity145 's , hosts theater and music every week , " says @entity106			1
" i walk past the @entity156 -- where @entity157 made his last public address -- under @entity159 , whose ruin is now attached to an interactive museum , which documents and celebrates the work of @entity116 ( @entity164 ) , ( @entity117 ) @entity117 and other writers from the area			0
" a historic horse fair @entity168 - born and bred writer @entity169 has always been inspired by @entity11 , where her mother 's family comes from			1
her mother shared stories about her life growing up in @entity175 , in @entity176 , with nine brothers and sisters			0
those stories have crept into @entity180 's work			1
" it seemed a form of rural @entity185 very distant to my own upbringing in a concrete and pebble - dash @entity168 suburb in the 1960s , " says @entity169 , whose books include a novel , " in sight of @entity196 , " " and two books of poetry , @entity193 " and " trapping a ghost			0
" " she had such freedom , and such fun and ' divilment , ' as people used to say			0
we 've returned to @entity175 frequently , though these days it 's usually for a family funeral			1
but i 'm still absorbed by how alive she [ my mother ] comes there , and how incredibly detailed her memories of a very happy past are			0
and i 'm still inspired by her to write poems			0
" for the visitor : the @entity211 and @entity212 in october , one of the oldest in @entity215 , dates back at least to the 1700s and attracts thousands of visitors , traders and @entity219 ( members of @entity11 's nomadic community )			1
elsewhere in @entity176 , @entity222 spent time in the 1920s at @entity224 , a 16th century @entity225 that served as a summer home and inspiration for his poem " @entity230			1
" an inspiration to @entity232 novelist and playwright @entity233 grew up on a farm in @entity236 , a region that barely merits a mention in some of @entity15 's tour books			1
yet amidst the ordinary midland landscape dotted with nondescript schools , restaurants and gas stations is a literary tourist 's dream			1
in @entity246 , the local nursing home seemed like nothing special			2
but for a time , it had been the house of celebrated novelist @entity250 ( 1767 - 1849 )			0
it 's where she lived almost all her life , where she wrote " @entity265 , " received sir @entity255 and @entity256 as visitors , wrote criticisms of the absentee landlord system and where @entity232 sent @entity261 a first edition of her novel " @entity264			2
" @entity266 , believed to be the inspiration for @entity232 's mr. @entity269 character in " @entity271 , " lived in nearby @entity270			2
growing up in @entity275 , with its ordinary life on top of extraordinary history , " made me look sideways at everything , " says @entity233 , whose debut novel , " solace , " was published last year			0
" that 's the way people look at things where i 'm from : sideways			2
never believing the first version of anything			0
always wondering , always doubting , always looking forward to dissecting it afterwards			0
" for the visitor : @entity275 is known for @entity261 , @entity287 , its fishing and the @entity289 , a bog road that was built in 148 b.c. inspiration at the ocean 's edge born and raised in the town that inspired @entity222 , short story writer @entity295 heads to @entity297 and the beach north of town to think and inspire her writing			1
" there 's one in @entity297 called @entity308 that 's usually almost empty and you can walk on the strand almost every day , no matter if the tide is in or out , " says @entity301 , whose work has appeared in the @entity303 and a collection called " @entity305			1
" " i take my shoes off , leave them at the rocks and walk with my feet at the edge of the water -- unless it 's snowing			2
i get my feet into the sand and have the sound and smell of the @entity323 all around me			0
it will always , always feel like home			2
if you walk the full length of the beach and back , you have clean feet and a very clear head by the end			2
" for the visitor : @entity333 celebrates @entity222 with the @entity334 and the @entity212 starting in late july with three weeks of poetry , music and other events			0
if you go : in celebration of @entity9 , @entity16 is giving away its @entity168 guide app from 12:01 a.m. pt on march 15 until 11:59 p.m. pt on march 17 ( regularly priced at $ 5.99 )			0
