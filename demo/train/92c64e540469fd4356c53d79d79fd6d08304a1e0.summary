-- when @entity2 hit @entity3 , it blacked out @entity4 and crippled the mass transit system			1
i was fortunate that the rising water from the @entity8 never reached my home in @entity10			2
but it was heartbreaking to see many parts of my beloved city wounded and so many people struggling			1
when the ferry service was partially restored , i took the first boat with a friend to @entity4 at dawn			2
we walked through the financial district -- normally bustling with activity -- where the traffic lights were dead and the streets were eerily quiet			2
like my experiences after 9/11 or during the @entity25 and the @entity26 , people seemed more aware of each other			2
people seemed to look out for each other , stopping to discuss the weather , the news or their personal stories in getting through the storm			1
" hey ! where 'd you get that coffee ? " became a key conversation starter in a city where getting a coffee has always been so easy			2
we met a harried transit worker who said he had been working for several days straight without sleep , toiling on the massive project of pumping water out of the flooded subway tunnels and inspecting the tracks			2
he told us about incredible levels of water , mountains of rats and the unimaginable stench			2
over the next two weekends , i volunteered in the @entity55 , an ocean - facing peninsula of @entity58 that was one of the most severely affected areas			1
i teamed up with @entity62 volunteers , a disaster relief group of young men and women from @entity66 , to help the residents with cleanup and recovery			2
i also joined a volunteer group known as the @entity71 that was focused more on organizing relief efforts			0
opinion : photographers , embrace @entity75 along the way , i met a man who had no family and lived alone and could n't haul the wreckage from his home by himself			1
i helped sift through the soggy rubble for the personal artifacts that someone might hold dear and want to keep : family heirlooms , photos , high school diplomas			1
it was a gut - wrenching experience			0
i met residents who were adamant that i leave the area before dark , because roving gangs of looters came to homes at night			0
map : see images of destruction , recovery across the @entity97 despite their remarkably dreary circumstances , those affected by the storm stayed amazingly positive and hopeful			1
they were grateful for the help , or even just someone to talk to			0
some of the communities showed their resilience by putting up @entity108 and @entity109 decorations as well as @entity111 flags , pulled out from the flooded basements and set up in comically absurd ways			0
in one street someone topped the mountain of sand washed several blocks inland with beach chairs and a sign that read " lifeguard on duty			0
" opinion : rebuilding after @entity2 is too big a risk while many parts of @entity3 resumed normalcy , there were whole neighborhoods that suffered and are still struggling			1
i felt frustrated that i could not help out in the cleanup as much as i would have liked			0
i was torn between the responsibility of my work and deadlines and the tugging feeling of wanting to drop everything to assist those in need			0
but i found a different way to help when i could not be on the ground			0
throughout the weeks , i would share images and stories of my experiences through @entity75			1
commenters from near and far asked how they could help , where to donate money or how to volunteer			0
i was glad to have a platform and an audience to provide information about local networks and initiatives , and nimble grass - roots organizations that were making an impact on people 's lives in a direct way			0
it 's important to remember that even as the effect of @entity2 recedes from the news , there are still devastated areas that are without electricity , heat or hot water			1
the outpouring of generosity has been incredible , but there is more to be done			0
there are high - rise apartment buildings with sick or elderly residents trapped in their freezing homes without enough food , water or medication who are unable to walk up and down several or dozens of flights of stairs to get what they need			0
there are lower - income areas of hard - hit neighborhoods that have not gotten much attention			1
these people will need help for weeks if not months			0
how you can help for those who are interested in helping , @entity187 is a great resource with up - to - date information			1
its @entity192 feed , @ @entity193 , is a constant sounding board for local initiatives with specific tasks			0
the most meaningful way to contribute is to be physically present in an affected area			1
there is no shortage in the need for helping hands , especially on weekdays and over the holidays			1
people who want to visit the scenes should recognize that residents have been through a lot			0
they 're exhausted , they 're chilly , sometimes they 're frightened or frustrated or just plain overwhelmed			0
a hello and a kind word go a long way			1
as the cold winter arrives , let 's not forget the disaster and the people whose lives have been turned upside down by it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			1
