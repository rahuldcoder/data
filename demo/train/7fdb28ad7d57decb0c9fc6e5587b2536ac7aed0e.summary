-- i was out roaming the streets of east @entity3 with a group of friends back in 2007 when we stumbled across this sweaty hipster club tucked between an old church and a bank			2
it was n't a very large space , holding maybe a couple of hundred people , but what it lacked in size was more than made up in the energy coming from the predominantly white , eclectic crowd on the dance floor			1
the music was a continuous flow of everything from ' 80s house music to current hip hop and i had just enough beers in me to join the raucous crowd in singing the words of each song at the top of my lungs			1
from @entity32 's " @entity31 " to @entity34 's " jump around , " it seemed with each track , the crowd grew louder and louder			0
then @entity37 's " @entity36 " came on			1
for those of you who do n't remember the chorus , allow me to refresh your memory : " now i ai n't sayin ' she 's a gold digger but she ai n't messin ' with no broke niggas " i 've never sobered up so quickly before in my life			0
there i was , one of maybe a handful of black people in a crowded , dark room with hundreds of drunk white people yelling the n - word			1
now obviously i never felt i was in any real danger			0
and even as the crowd repeated the word over and over and over again , not once did i think anyone around me meant anything malicious by it			2
still , i became angry ... i just was n't sure at whom			0
i thought , " what is it with white people and that word ? " but then i also had to ask myself , " what is it with black people and that word ? " after all , at least on that night , @entity37 was the one who brought it up			1
last week dr. @entity66 used the word repeatedly on her radio show in a discussion with a caller			1
the knee jerk reaction to her rant is to demand she be fired			0
that was also the response to @entity74 ' on - air racial slur back in 2007 , and @entity77 's racially charged comment in 2003 , and of course who can forget @entity80 for sort of getting the ball rolling in 1988			2
i believe @entity66 and the others deserve the repercussions their actions have drawn , but i am frustrated that as a nation we continue to interpret the censure of such people as progress while ignoring some of the uncomfortable truths nestled inside their racist diatribes			1
it is in dissecting these uncomfortable truths that we get to the actual social progress , not with the cosmetic firings that make us all feel better for a moment			0
for example , i know there is a contingent of black people who claim our usage of the n - word is done so affectionately that 's why it 's ok for us to use it and not whites			1
i do n't believe it 's ok for anyone to use the word because of its undeniable link to one of the country 's most brutal and disgusting periods			2
it was a word used to intimidate and belittle			2
any attempt to alter its meaning through some warped sense of exclusivity is not only misguided , but disrespectful to the blood of both blacks and whites that was spilled in the name of racial equality			0
yes , between friends it could hold a different connotation			0
but i would argue there is very little affection in @entity37 using the word in a song , and that our continual injection of the word into pop culture is not only hypocritical but unintentionally gives white hipsters in @entity3 , @entity140 , @entity141 or any other city where a song like " @entity36 " can be heard , permission to say it			1
the substantive question , the one that could lead to a better understanding , is n't who is saying the n - word , but why			1
now , if a white person said something like that , they could be labeled a racist			2
me ? someone out there is calling me an @entity157 right now			0
and it 's this sophomoric labeling that keeps us locked in a hamster wheel			0
it 's hard for me to believe that @entity66 's remarks were rooted in a genuine yearning to promote honest dialogue about race -- more like a belligerent attempt to shock , likely out of her own frustrations			1
how could a white person who has been in media as long as she has be ignorant of the ramifications of uttering the n - word on air ? but she was right about one thing : culturally neither blacks nor whites have the courage to talk honestly across color lines			1
we still act as if " colorblindness " can be achieved without addressing the nuances of race in a country with a complicated history such as ours			0
so , politically we coin euphemisms like " inner city " and " real @entity187 " as if no one knows what 's really being said			0
we draw lines in the sand on topics such as the n - word and we 're quick to assign harsh names to anyone who tries to cross that line , because bullying is much easier than listening			1
i know , i know , we have a black president , that 's got to mean something , right ? yes , it does			0
but also keep in mind the nation has also seen a dramatic increase in hate group membership and we have a new political movement with racist organizers woven into the early stages of its fabric since the election of that black president			0
this language is n't helping			0
there is still a lot of work to be done and quite frankly the rebuke of @entity66 does very little in addressing that work			1
just as dismissing @entity74 , @entity77 et al has done little			0
public gaffes like these need to move beyond reactionary name - calling and firings and toward the kind of conversations that can only happen when we remove the muzzle of fear			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			1

@entity231 says he was at a club of mainly white people singing along to hip hop music
he was shocked when they all began shouting the n - word along with @entity37 song
" what is it with white people and that word ? " he asks , but then notes that @entity37 brought it up
*writer* : word too *freighted* and *hurtful* to be *tossed* around by dr. @entity66 or anyone else
