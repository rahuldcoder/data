the announcement comes amid concerns in @entity0 over the performance of its forces during last year 's invasion of @entity16 , an expert on the @entity1 military told @entity2			1
@entity19 , an analyst at the @entity20 in @entity21 , said the campaign against the former @entity24 republic had revealed significant weaknesses within @entity1 's armed forces			1
" the @entity16 thing was a wake - up call on a number of fronts , " said @entity19 , a former @entity29 military and defense attache in @entity1			1
" things they expected to perform well did n't -- communications , the air force			0
it took five days , which is quite a long time , to suppress another country 's air defenses , quite a small country 's			0
" @entity3 said the " most important task is to re-equip the [ @entity1 ] @entity44 with newest weapons system , " in televised remarks to defense ministry officials			2
he said the process had already begun and would accelerate through 2011			0
@entity3 insisted that falling prices for oil and gas -- which contribute significantly to @entity0 's budget -- would not force him to scale back on plans to modernize the military			1
the defense budget has " virtually remained the same as was planned , " @entity3 said , " despite our current financial problems			0
" the country will aim for 70 percent of its weaponry to be " modern " by 2020 , defense minister @entity58 said , according to @entity61 , the state - run news agency			1
@entity1 invaded @entity16 , to its south , in august of last year -- the first time @entity1 military forces had engaged in an offensive outside their borders since the collapse of the @entity24 in 1991			1
the conflict strengthened the hand of @entity3 , who favors reform , against generals who oppose it , @entity19 , the military analyst , told @entity2			2
" it gave @entity3 a chance to reply to opponents in @entity76 : ' we need much more mobile forces , better weaponry , ' " @entity19 said			0
but @entity19 pointed out that @entity1 has been talking about modernizing its army almost since the end of the @entity82 nearly two decades ago			0
former president @entity83 announced in the early 1990s that @entity1 would replace its conscript army with a professional force by 2010 , @entity19 said -- a target it has come nowhere close to meeting			0
modernization foundered on @entity1 's need to bring in money by exporting arms , rather than using the products of its military - industrial complex itself ; opposition from entrenched interests in the @entity76 , which opposed downsizing ; and in the face of a national security strategy that focused on conflicts like the two @entity100 wars			1
former president @entity101 staked his popularity in the late 1990s on winning the second war with the restive @entity100 , @entity19 observed			0
@entity3 , too , wants to promote pride in the country 's military , the analyst said , but has a " more nuanced approach " than his predecessor , who remains influential as prime minister			2
@entity19 said @entity3 believes @entity1 forces should be capable of operating alongside @entity113 forces			2
but , he added , " some of the generals do n't agree with him			0
