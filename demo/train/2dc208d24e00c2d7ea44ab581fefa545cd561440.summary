@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 came to @entity5 ski resort in eastern @entity6 last month for what was supposed to be a skiing getaway			1
actress @entity3 died after suffering an epidural hematoma in a fall during a ski lesson			1
but what she may not have known is some doctors have been arguing that if a person here is in need of urgent care at a medical trauma center , he or she may not be able to get there fast enough			1
the only way to get to the closest trauma center from here is to drive 2½ hours to @entity24			1
no helicopter medical service is available			1
the @entity6 newspaper @entity27 obtained 911 recordings from monday , march 16 , when @entity3 fell on a beginners slope on a sunny , clear day at the resort			1
the first request for help came in at 12:43 p.m. , an urgent call that a woman had fallen on the slopes			0
seventeen minutes later , at 1 p.m. , an ambulance arrived , but @entity3 had been able to walk away from the fall and was headed back to her hotel room			2
ten minutes later the ambulance was told to stand down , the call canceled			0
what @entity3 could n't have known is that she suffered an epidural hematoma			1
it 's a condition where a blood clot forms between the skull and the outer layer of the brain			0
too much pressure can cause brain damage and even death			0
symptoms include dizziness , headaches and nausea			0
" the person seems to be fine and walks it off , and that 's one of the problems with an injury such as this , " said dr. @entity55 , a neurologist with the @entity56			0
" anytime there is any sort of process expanding in the skull , which is a closed space , once the symptoms are apparent , it can be a matter of 30 minutes to an hour to 90 minutes before there is a major deterioration			1
" two hours after her initial fall , while @entity3 was back in her hotel room , she was feeling the symptoms			0
the clock was ticking and she needed to get to a trauma center fast			1
with the closest trauma center 2½ hours away , time may have been running out on her			1
it 's recommended that anyone with an epidural hematoma get to the trauma center within 30 - 90 minutes			1
at 2:59 p.m. , another ambulance was dispatched to the resort			0
this time , the paramedics went inside and worked on @entity3 for 33 minutes before transporting her to the closest hospital an hour away , but it is not a trauma center			1
inside the ambulance , @entity3 drifted in and out of consciousness			0
" it is a rapidly deteriorating situation and the distance might have been just too much by ambulance , road ambulance or air ambulance			0
it 's difficult to say , " said @entity55 , who did not treat @entity3			0
depending on the severity of the injury at the time , he said , even helicopter services may have been too late			0
some trauma doctors have argued for air transport here since the mid- 1990s			1
they say the safest and fastest way to move anyone suffering a trauma injury such as @entity3 's is by helicopter			1
helicopter transport is common practice in the @entity109 and other areas of @entity6			2
but in the @entity1 region , very few places have access to air transport			2
in an open letter to the citizens of @entity1 sent to the @entity117 , dr. @entity118 , director of professional services at the @entity120 , said incidents like @entity3 's should serve as a wake - up call to @entity1			2
" it is no longer morally acceptable for our citizens who , in the moment of their greatest needs , do not have access to a rapid transit system that gives them the best chance to not only survive , but to survive with a quality of life			0
" @entity136 , director of @entity1 's pre-hospital care , told the @entity117 that cost is prohibitive when a one - hour flight costs $ 6,000			2
it 's a question of resources and priorities focusing on " the biggest gain for the biggest need , " he said			0
@entity3 was taken from @entity5 to a hospital in @entity146 , which does not have the facilities to help someone with a severe head trauma			2
@entity3 was transferred to the trauma center in @entity24 about 7 p.m. , more than six hours after her initial fall			1
twenty - four hours later she was flown to a @entity151 , where she was taken off life support and died			0
no one can answer the question whether a helicopter service could have saved @entity3 's life			2
she refused services immediately after her fall , but with the clock ticking immediately after she felt symptoms from her injury , 2½ hours may have been too far away even if she 'd gotten help immediately .			0

resort where @entity3 was injured is 2½ - hour drive from trauma center
no helicopter medical services are available
with epidural hematoma , survival *window* without treatment is about 90 minutes
some @entity6 trauma doctors have argued for air transport since 1990s
