-- @entity1 thought he had the body of the ideal man : 6 feet 2 inches of tanned musculature , sculpted arms and washboard abs that narrowed to a firm , 34 - inch waist			1
his perfectly chiseled body was hairless due to regular " manscaping			2
" people assumed he worked out three hours a day , seven days a week , but the 31 - year - old personal trainer said nutrition was really the key to his dream body			2
as for working out , he indulged in his favorite activity for only about 45 minutes a day , four to five days a week			0
then , @entity1 's once impressive muscles softened to pounds of bloated fat -- on purpose			1
@entity1 , a personal trainer , decided to gain nearly 70 pounds so he could better understand how his clients feel			0
he then planned to lose the weight to show that no matter the numbers they faced , others could get fit , too			0
he called it his " @entity30 " campaign , and documented it on a blog , and a book that debuts in june			0
he expected some physical discomfort , but the emotional struggle -- and judgment from others -- surprised him			0
as he loaded sugary cereals and soft drinks from his cart at the local grocery store one day , he caught three women staring at him , then sliding their eyes to the food he was buying			0
" ' i 'm doing this as an experiment ! i used to be a fit guy , not the fat guy , ' " @entity1 wanted to turn around and explain			0
" i 'm a lot more self - conscious now			0
there was a total lack of confidence in the way i felt in public because i was n't the fit guy anymore			0
" the female form has long been the topic of discussions about self - esteem , but what about men ? their ideas about weight , body image and self - esteem have been largely swept under the ambiguous rug of masculinity			1
meanwhile , changing standards about the ideal male form can leave them overwhelmed and exhausted by the chase for perfection , too			1
men do n't talk about it as much , health experts say , but that does n't mean they 're not thinking about it , whether they 're ultra-fit or kind of fat			1
" men are still taught as boys that the body is something that is designed to be a perfectly performing machine , not something to be cared for and nurtured , " said @entity75 , professor of psychology at @entity77 and author of " invisible men			1
" " but men base self - esteem on body image and weight			1
" inside the man in the mirror as a professor for 17 years and counting , @entity75 has observed how the male college students in his classes have changed and adapted to shifting cultural norms			1
in recent years , more of them spend time in the gym , focus on their appearance and monitor body mass. most are n't trying to lose weight -- they 're documenting their physique , he said			1
it 's a far cry from the male celebrities of the 1950s -- think @entity105 or @entity106 -- who wore their heftiness as a sign of financial success or a way to demonstrate masculinity , @entity75 said			1
he attributes the change to shifting gender roles			0
" as women gain more financial power in society , men are expected to bring more to the table , " @entity75 said			1
" in addition to being financially successful , they need to be well - groomed , in good shape , emotionally skilled in relationships and the emphasis on looking good is just part of the bigger package -- the stakes have been raised			0
" some psychologists and trend watchers said the male muscle obsession only grew during the last few years			1
as the economy struggled , men were sent looking for aspects of their lives they could define and control			2
body image is , at times , the only thing			0
" men ca n't control how much money they make or their employment situation , but they can control how they look			2
it can create this obsessiveness , " said @entity143 , senior health editor for @entity144			0
@entity147 , a psychology professor at @entity148 , said some men develop powerful , physically intimidating bodies as a display of masculinity in face of threats			1
but becoming a father pushes some men to lead healthier lives -- and as a consequence , develop a healthier - looking body , too			2
" one very important role for men , in terms of how they 're masculine , is their role as fathers , " @entity147 said			2
" you can make health more salient to men and connect it to their sense of masculinity by appealing to fulfilling the role of being a father			1
" but in a world of changing ideals and rising obesity rates , what is it they 're all idealizing ? the new physical ideal lately , big and bulky has been pushed to the wayside , and the swimmer 's physique reigns supreme , editors of men 's magazines and websites say			1
the male silhouette landing on magazine covers and action flicks is tall , lean , agile and fit			1
it 's a physique that 's more attainable for most men than the beefy - torso - and - chicken - leg look of the past			1
" our readers want the concept that this body is natural , " said @entity143			0
" a body that is inspired by nature , rather than machine , supplement or wealth to be able to buy you that body			0
" " our ideal male wants to look like he is healthy and confident , but not perfectly coiffed or manicured , " said @entity204 , senior fashion and grooming editor of @entity206			1
" he wants to look well - maintained			0
" that 's the real ideal : they want to look great , but they do n't want to look like they spend too much time on it -- but they know they need to spend time on it			1
" @entity204 points to actor @entity218 as an example of making the effortless look like an art form -- always the right amount of scruff and perfectly tousled hair , even if they use a beard trimmer to shave down scruff and pomade for the slept - in look			2
actors like @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 are constantly seen sporting tailored suits			0
rather than the clothes themselves , it is the fit that displays the effort they put into their appearance , and this is showing up in the workplace as well			2
this is the result of what some call the " ' @entity247 ' revival " -- the return of pomade , polish and of the perfectly cut suit			2
it stays within the boundaries of masculinity while offering men the option of looking their best			1
" men are seeing grooming not as an extra , but an essential , " @entity204 said			2
current trends might make topics like health and grooming more approachable for men while promoting a healthier ideal , but psychologists @entity147 and @entity75 do n't expect body image to become a big topic among guys			1
but @entity1 has been hearing plenty about it			0
as he put on 70 pounds as part of his experiment , he said he often received e-mails from " typical @entity275 men , " former high school and college athletes who stopped caring for their health and bodies after school or marriage			1
@entity1 said he believes they fell prey to the " masculine marketing " of fast food and beer			0
" at one point in their life , a majority of men were fit , whether it was in elementary school or high school , " he said , " then life gets busy			2
" he said he realizes now how obsessed he was with a physical ideal , and what it feels like to be so many pounds away from it ; @entity1 is still taking the weight off			2
his friends , family and wife understood he would n't be overweight forever			0
but he has gained empathy for his personal training clients , and a new understanding of strangers who stared at a man approaching 265 pounds			0
" maybe i was on the other side of it before , " @entity1 said			0
" maybe i was more judgmental before i went through this whole thing			0

the new male ideal does not *reflect* the typical @entity275 male
a revival of standards is making men more comfortable with their appearance and masculinity
the swimmer 's physique , a long , lean look , is becoming the new ideal
