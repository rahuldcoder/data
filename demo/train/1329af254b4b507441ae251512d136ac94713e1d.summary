@entity0 , @entity1 -- despite deep public spending cuts that triggered waves of protests last year , @entity4 will not default on its debt payment obligations , prime minister @entity3 told @entity2			1
" this is not on the books ... it 's not on our road map			2
and this is why we are talking about these other measures , which we think are enough to be able to make things sustainable , " @entity3 told @entity2 's @entity14 on the sidelines of the @entity16 in @entity0 thursday			1
" obviously ( it will be ) difficult , but we have been doing our work , and we will be successful , " he said			1
the economic troubles in @entity4 last year sparked a wave of sovereign debt woes across @entity24 , especially hitting @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
the value of the euro cratered during the debt crisis and raised lingering questions about the viability of the 17 - nation monetary union			1
a @entity34 released this week at @entity0 show 59 % of respondents believe that at least one or more euro nation would break from the monetary union by 2016 , and nearly three - quarters polled thought @entity4 would default on its loans			1
" well , maybe people will believe things , but that 's why we politicians are here , to put things on the right course , " @entity3 said when asked about the poll			1
" and there is the political will of our peoples and the leaders of the @entity52 ... to make sure that in 2016 and 2020 and on , the euro will exist			2
" his comments echoed the sentiment @entity57 president @entity56 who in his @entity0 address thursday said : " we will never abandon the euro			1
never ! @entity61 spells @entity24 , the euro is @entity24			2
@entity24 has meant 60 years of peace on our continent			0
we will never abandon that			0
" @entity56 's spirited defense of the euro underlined how high the stakes have become for the economic evolution of the continent			1
" to imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each other 's throats for centuries , we now have one wish , and that is lasting peace , " @entity56 said			2
but @entity80 has been challenged as the bailout of @entity4 thrust the spotlight on the uneven economics among member nations			1
besides debt woes in @entity4 , countries like @entity25 and @entity26 were deeply exposed to the crash of the housing bubble			1
meanwhile , the @entity90 economy -- the largest in @entity24 -- enjoyed its fastest expansion in two decades last year and its largest growth in gdp since @entity90 reunified in 1990			0
concern has grown of an unfair burden placed on larger economies by the problems of smaller economies like @entity4			2
but @entity3 said @entity4 is well on its way toward reducing its debt			1
" we have made very good progress , because we 're on track , and i would say , even , beyond			0
we have cut the deficit by over 6.5 percent , which is a huge cut , " @entity3 said			2
" we 've changed our pension system , it 's now a viable pension system , one of the most viable in @entity24			0
we 've changed our tax system , it 's transparent , more effective , hitting tax evasion , " he said			0
" but the structural things we 're changing are actually going to bring growth			0
" @entity115 , the president of the @entity116 , told @entity2 " this is no time for complacency -- that is absolutely clear			0
but let me tell you , nevertheless , that the real economy is giving signs that are encouraging			0
" the main risk is to practice benign neglect ... as soon as things are going better , to forget that we had to cope with a very , very demanding crisis , " @entity115 said			0
" so , we have to draw all the lessons			0
" @entity2 's @entity14 , @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
