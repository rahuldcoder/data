-- the cast of the upcoming film " x-men : @entity7 " made a surprise appearance at @entity5 this afternoon along with director @entity6			1
the cast members who appeared include those from the original " x-men " movie franchise and those from 2011 's @entity13 reboot " x : men : @entity16			1
" @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 assembled in @entity30 to debut footage from the film			1
@entity24 has been rumored to be playing the villain in the film since photos from the set leaked earlier this summer , but at first the " @entity38 " actor would n't confirm his role			1
" i 'm playing mystique , " he joked			0
he later officially confirmed his participation by saying , " i get to play @entity42			1
" @entity6 directed 2000 's " x-men " and 2003 's " @entity45 , " and produced 2009 's " x-men origins : @entity46			1
" the director set up this new film in the series , which will be released in theaters on may 23 , 2014 , explaining the character of @entity46 ( @entity26 ) will be the central figure bringing the story together			1
the upcoming " @entity46 " film out next week will act as a bridge for the character , @entity26 said			1
another can of " @entity58 " " the goal was to try and make a film that would bring this cast together by time travel or time displacement of some kind , " @entity6 said			1
" basically , the notion is that consciousness of @entity46 of the future is sent into his past self			0
and it was nice because @entity26 was able to play both parts because the character of @entity46 is ageless			1
and it was great to be able to place him as a character in both these worlds			0
for me , it was great to reunite the old cast and get to work as a director with the new cast			1
" @entity6 also addressed rumors that this new film will rewrite the movie universe he 's set up in prior films , specifically changing some of the events from " @entity45			1
" " whenever you 're going back in time -- and this is every bit as much a time travel movie as it is an x-men movie -- there is those risks , " @entity6 said			1
" i 'm not the audience , i 'm just the filmmaker , but i do believe in certain continuity that we 'll maintain and some things we 'll change			0
when you go back and mess about , things happen			0
so some of those rumors are probably somewhat true			0
" @entity103 vs. @entity102 , friends or foes ? there will be some interaction between the older and younger versions of the characters , according to @entity6			1
the director screened a reel of film footage that included a teaser of that			1
" @entity46 is the journeyman , " @entity6 said			0
" his interaction with the younger cast is primary			2
there is a moment , which you 'll see in this reel , where these characters come face to face , older self with younger self			2
and we tried to do it in a unique way			0
it 's been done before , but with my first opportunity to make a time travel film i want to create this set of rules and stay with them			1
" one of the big surprises is that professor @entity137 ( @entity20 ) is still alive after the events of 2006 's " x-men : @entity140			2
" in that film , the character of @entity142 killed @entity137 -- mostly			2
@entity144 promotes new film " my assumption was that it was going to be @entity22 and @entity147 and @entity26 and everybody back , but it wo n't be me , " @entity20 said			2
" but something happened , which i 'm not allowed to talk about -- am i ? " in my own mind i understand how @entity137 is alive at the end of ' @entity154 , ' " @entity6 responded			0
" at the end of ' @entity154 ' after the credits when his consciousness is inside of this woman in a hospital and you take that and mix it with some powerful mutants -- mutants can do a lot of cool stuff -- you can imagine that anything is possible			0
" the film takes place during several time periods , including the 1970s , which allowed for some interesting costume choices beyond the x-men suits			1
" i personally love the moments when i get to wear the ' 70s clothes , " said @entity174 , who ( really ) plays @entity175			0
" i really enjoy them because i love that time and i like wearing clothes when i can			2
some of the @entity175 stuff , some of the look is a little bit different			0
we 're still using the same paint			0
when we left the ( last ) movie , she was mutant and proud			0
she was kind of struggling with the problem that a lot of normal human people struggle with , which is how they look			0
so she was very covered up in the first movie , but this time she is mutant and proud			2
" " it 's a very collaborative thing , " @entity18 added			0
" that 's a thing that i 've found as a whole : the clothes we wear , the @entity199 outfit , being on set			0
" " the best thing about playing the older @entity199 this time -- no helmet , " @entity22 said , telling @entity18 , " we 'll talk about helmets later			2
" the cast members also discussed their ongoing friendships			1
one of the benefits of the film was bringing the original cast members back together and for @entity211 , who plays @entity212 , this film was a chance to reunite with old friends			1
" we all love the films , but what 's nice for me is that in the first movie we all became such good friends , " @entity211 said			0
" and we really like each other and we like being around each other so to have a chance to do the work and hang out with the people we really respect , admire and like to be around is the joy of coming back to do these movies			0
the beauty is we pick up as if we just saw each other yesterday			0
i was really happy to see everybody and meet the new cast			2
