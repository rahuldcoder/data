@entity0 -- the pilots of @entity4 flight 4013 say that @entity5 was correctly programmed into their on - board computer sunday , but that they " mistakenly identified " another airport as @entity8 when they saw its bright lights , according to the @entity10			1
the explanation , aviators say , is an example of " confirmation bias , " the tendency of people to confirm their beliefs , and dismiss conflicting information			2
the captain , a veteran with 16,000 hours of flying experience , had never before flown into @entity8 , investigators were told			0
the first officer had flown into the airport on one previous occasion , but during daylight , investigators said			0
@entity4 suspended both pilots following the incident , pending the outcome of the investigation , which is continuing			0
according to the @entity10 , the pilots told investigators that the approach had been programmed into their flight management system			1
but that they first saw the airport beacon and the runway lights of @entity37 , located in @entity38 , @entity39 , about seven miles away			2
the pilots " mistakenly identified " it as @entity5 , the @entity10 said			2
they cited the bright runway lights at @entity37 and the fact that the runway was oriented in a similar direction			0
they told investigators they flew a visual approach into the airport and did not realize they were at the wrong airport until they had landed			1
they confirmed that they utilized heavy braking to bring the aircraft to a stop and then advised the @entity5 tower that they had landed at the wrong airport			1
the @entity10 said it has downloaded information from the plane 's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder and are analyzing the data			1
the cockpit voice recorder shows air traffic controllers informed the @entity4 crew that that they were 15 miles from their intended target , which was @entity5			0
the crew responded that they had the airfield in sight and controllers cleared the aircraft for a visual approach and landing on runway 14 at @entity5			0
according to the cockpit voice recorder , the landing was uneventful and it was not until shortly after touching down that the crew realized they had landed at the wrong airport .			1

the @entity10 releases new information on last sunday 's wrong airport landing in @entity39
