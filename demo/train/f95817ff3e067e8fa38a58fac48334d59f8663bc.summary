@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than seven months after the @entity3 authorized @entity5 forces to protect demonstrators in @entity1 , the aerial bombing campaign operation that helped depose longtime leader @entity8 ended here monday at midnight			1
" i think what has happened in @entity1 sends a very clear signal to autocratic regimes all over the world , " @entity5 secretary - general @entity9 told reporters earlier in the day after arriving in @entity0 from @entity11 , @entity12			1
" we have been mandated by the @entity18 @entity3 to protect civilians and that mission has been a great success , " he told @entity2 during the flight			1
" we have prevented a massacre			0
we have saved countless lives			0
we have fully implemented the @entity18 mandate			0
that was our mission and we have done what we promised to do			0
" but the @entity28 said monday that the @entity29 will continue monitoring @entity1 from the skies even after the end of formal @entity5 military operations			1
" there will be some kind of overwatch role for a little while after the actual end , " @entity28 spokesman , capt. @entity36 said			2
" we are still working with our @entity5 allies on that			2
" @entity29 manned and unmanned aircraft played a key reconnaissance role in the @entity1 operation even after @entity29 forces stopped taking the lead combat role			0
and @entity47 spokesman @entity46 told @entity2 that he was expecting the mission would be suspended rather than canceled			1
" to cancel it , in these circumstances , i do n't think was the right decision , especially at this time , " he said , citing the continued presence of @entity51 elements			0
interim prime minister chosen @entity5 's move comes after the @entity18 @entity3 last week rescinded its march mandate for military intervention to protect civilians targeted during anti-regime protests			1
@entity61 , the @entity29 ambassador to the @entity18 , said @entity5 's mission puts @entity1 on a path to freedom			1
but she tempered her remarks with a word of caution			0
" we 're very concerned that , as we move forward , that the authorities make maximum effort to swiftly form an inclusive government that incorporates all aspects of @entity1 society , and in which the rights of all @entity1 people are fully and thoroughly respected , regardless of their gender , their religion , their region of origin , " @entity69 said after the @entity3 vote last thursday			2
" but for the @entity29 , and , i think , for the @entity18 @entity3 , this closes what i think history will judge to be a proud chapter in the @entity3 's history			2
" as of monday , @entity88 had flown 7,943 total sorties , 1,851 strike sorties and 398 total strikes in which ordnance was dropped			0
momentum to end the campaign began building after @entity8 was killed following his capture near his hometown of @entity97 on october 20			1
many @entity99 military personnel who had been stationed at an @entity101 airfield for the campaign already are returning home			2
meanwhile , @entity8 's relatives said they plan to file a war crimes complaint			1
" all of the events that have taken place since february 2011 and the murder of @entity8 , all of this means we are totally in our right to call upon the @entity115 , " @entity106 , a lawyer representing the family , said last week			1
questions have been raised about how @entity8 was killed			0
amateur videos showed him alive when captured by the opposition			0
he died from a shot in the head , officials said , but the circumstances surrounding the shot remain unclear			0
@entity5 's @entity1 campaign began in march , after the @entity3 adopted @entity125 , which imposed a no - fly zone in the country 's airspace and authorized member states to take measures to protect civilians			1
