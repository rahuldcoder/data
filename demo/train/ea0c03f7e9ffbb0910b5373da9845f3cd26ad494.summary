a rung on the long ladder to @entity2 broke friday , when a rocket test in @entity4 ended in a midair ball of fire			1
debris from the unmanned @entity7 ( @entity9 ) rocket , which self - destructed less than 20 seconds after launch , rained down from the flames onto an open field outside of @entity13			1
a hitch turned up during launch , and the " flight termination system automatically terminated the mission , " @entity7 said in a statement			0
" there were no injuries or near - injuries			0
" but it was a vivid firework for bystanders parked on a nearby country road -- and for their cellphone cameras			0
@entity27 affiliate @entity26 reported the explosion on friday and posted video			0
@entity7 said it will look at flight data to determine what went wrong with the three - engine version of the rocket			2
all about the landing it 's not how it flies up but how it comes down that makes the @entity9 a steppingstone to a @entity2 mission			1
the rocket has a landing gear -- four legs that stick out like an insect 's			1
so did its even shorter predecessor , which bore the name @entity48			0
until now , @entity50 space rockets have never been designed to return in the same fashion or form as they departed			2
the bulk of the rocket was jettisoned into the ocean , or discarded in low orbit to fall back through @entity58 's cosmic incinerator , or left in the eternal void			1
whatever you wanted to keep -- solid boosters , capsules , astronauts -- had to be lowered with chutes or glide in on a shuttle			0
all of it , in one piece , slowly backs down to the pad it took off from , using its booster engines , and sets down gingerly on its feet			0
that makes it reusable , a characteristic useful for a future mission to @entity2 -- if anyone plans to return home from there , that is			1
@entity2 , here we come a trip to the @entity81 is the visionary call of the space industry			1
@entity84 , a @entity85 nonprofit , already is taking applications for one - way space pioneers who would spend the rest of their lives on a permanent @entity2 settlement			1
@entity7 ceo @entity92 has a similar ambition : he foresees the human colonization of @entity2 and other planets as the next step in human evolution , according to the company 's website			1
there is also a less sexy but more immediate advantage to reusable rockets : they save tons of money			1
@entity7 's large @entity107 rockets cost about $ 54 million each , the company says			2
that 's roughly the price tag of a smaller pre-owned passenger jet in good shape			0
but a jet flies multiple times			0
making rockets reusable would cut space flight costs enormously , @entity7 says			2
that competitive edge could come in handy really soon			0
@entity7 and three other firms -- @entity118 , @entity119 and the @entity120 -- are racing to develop a " safe , reliable and cost - effective " means of transporting crew to low - @entity58 orbit , according a statement from @entity125 this week			2
the space agency plans to award , this month or next , " one or more contracts " for commercial transport to and from the @entity127			0
@entity2 hopefuls ponder life without families , favorite foods a short - hopper @entity9 rockets do n't rumble the earth with the kind of thunder that the space shuttles or @entity140 rockets once did , and the @entity9 is relatively small , comprising only one stage			1
it 's a sawed - off version of its parent , the @entity107 9 , the first rocket from a commercial company to fly to the @entity127 , according to @entity7			1
nine rocket engines fire up to boost the @entity107 9 into @entity58 's orbit			2
just three propel the @entity9 , which has only flown to an altitude of 1,000 meters ( 3,280 feet )			2
that 's less than twice the height of @entity152 's @entity151 -- a trivial feat for a rocket -- but coming back down from there in one piece is not			1
rocket science is , well , rocket science , even for small rockets sometimes , and failures in various stages of space missions happen regularly			0
in mid-may , a @entity164 satellite launch went sour when the rocket veered off path , causing an emergency system to cut off propulsion			0
the rocket had traveled 100 miles high and reportedly burned up in the atmosphere on its way back down			0
it was at least the fourth failure by a @entity174 rocket , a legendary workhorse of the @entity164 space program			0
as @entity92 tweeted after @entity9 's self - detonation : " @entity178 are tricky ... " opinion : why i signed up for a one - way trip to @entity2			1

the rocket self - destructed as a safety measure
it 's a common practice in the *aerospace* industry
the *experimental* @entity9 can land on its feet and is designed to be reusable
reusable rockets could be useful for travel to @entity2 -- and back again
