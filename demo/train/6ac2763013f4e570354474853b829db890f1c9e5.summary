-- whalers from a @entity3 coastal town have celebrated the start of this year 's hunting season by slicing up a whale in front of a crowd of school children			1
in the town of @entity12 , 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) south of @entity13 in @entity14 , dozens of 10 - year - old students watched thursday as workers carved up a 30 - foot @entity17 's beaked whale during an educational field trip , before being served a meal of fried whale meat			1
whaling remains a way of life for fishermen in @entity12 , and they are eager to pass on the trade to the next generation			0
children are taught about the history of whaling , the biology of the animals , and how to cook the meat			0
whalers say they 've been catching and eating whales in the area for centuries			0
this year 's hunting season , which began on june 20 , is the first since an international court ordered @entity3 to end its controversial research whaling expedition in the @entity40 , after failing to find evidence the program had legitimate scientific value			1
the city of @entity45 , of which @entity12 is a part , has one of a handful of ports that is exempt from the ban under a small - scale coastal whaling program			1
so far this year , @entity52 has hunted six whales in the city 's coastal waters and plans to catch another 24 before the season ends in august			0
despite the @entity40 ban and growing pressure from the international community , @entity3 has continued its northwest @entity61 scientific whaling mission			1
it is also eager to revise its @entity40 program to allow the hunt to continue while satisfying the demands of the @entity67 's @entity66			2
in @entity3 's parliament last month , prime minister @entity68 said he would like the country to resume commercial whaling " in order to obtain scientific information indispensable to the management of the whale resources			1

@entity81 from the @entity82 believes it 's time @entity3 moved from killing whales to conserving them			0
" respect for cultural differences is fundamental , but friends of @entity3 and fans of @entity3 culture around the world are watching this with sadness , " @entity81 told @entity0 's @entity86			0
" @entity3 school children should be meeting whales through whale watching , not eating whale meat , " he said			2
@entity3 's supporters of eating whale meat say that it is a tradition that dates back hundreds of years , and accuses western critics of cultural imperialism			1
but consumption rates across the country have fallen in recent years , leading to large stockpiles of whale meat			0
last month , @entity3 's @entity106 released a photo of the agriculture minister @entity108 eating a bowl of whale meat to encourage other @entity3 citizen to do the same , and visitors to the ministry were given free samples of the delicacy			2
