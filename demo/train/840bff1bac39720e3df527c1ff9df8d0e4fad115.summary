@entity13 striker @entity12 looked to have given the @entity14 all three points , and closed the gap on leaders @entity18 to four points , with a penalty in the eighth minute of injury time at the @entity22			1
but with the last kick of the game , @entity24 's compatriot @entity23 converted a spot - kick for @entity29 's team to hand the visitors an extraordinary leveler in the 12th minute of time added on			1
the result left @entity2 six points behind @entity36 's team with only six matches left of the season , ahead of @entity18 's trip to @entity40 on tuesday and the @entity14 ' @entity42 derby at @entity43 the following evening			1

in a match of few chances , the breakthrough finally arrived for @entity2 deep into injury time when @entity84 tripped @entity90 as the @entity96 midfielder looked to dribble through the @entity11 rearguard			2
@entity24 stepped up to confidently dispatch the penalty for his 13th league goal of the campaign , sending goalkeeper @entity101 the wrong way , but @entity2 's defensive frailty was once again exposed			2
@entity105 forward @entity104 saw his free - kick slam off the wall before @entity108 inexplicably shoved @entity11 midfielder @entity62 inside the box as the @entity110 looked to gather the loose ball			1
just like his international teammate , @entity23 coolly slotted home to steal a point for @entity11			2
meanwhile , @entity115 will play @entity116 in the @entity118 final after a convincing 5 - 0 win over fellow @entity4 side @entity120 at @entity42 's @entity121 on sunday			1

@entity133 's @entity120 are four - time winners of the knockout competition , but the club 's hopes of a first victory since 1958 were extinguished by three first - half goals			2

@entity115 doubled the lead seven minutes later when @entity149 defender @entity129 took advantage of a sloppy clearance from @entity152 to find the bottom corner from the edge of penalty area			2
it was 3 - 0 to the @entity158 side after half an hour , when @entity159 striker @entity130 provided a cool finish from another @entity147 pass			0
@entity163 international @entity162 claimed his first goal after 68 minutes when he ran from inside @entity115 's half before curling a wonderful finish beyond @entity120 goalkeeper @entity167			1
the rout was complete with nine minutes remaining when @entity132 scuffed his shot over the veteran @entity170 from a @entity130 cross			0
