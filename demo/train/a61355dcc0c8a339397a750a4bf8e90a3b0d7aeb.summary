-- the 2014 @entity2 season may have only just got going , but @entity3 is already playing catch up			1
that 's the view of technical director @entity6 , who admits the legendary @entity8 marque is some way behind early pacesetters @entity11 , labeling @entity3 's performance in sunday 's opening race as " unacceptable			1
" while @entity11 enjoyed a fruitful preseason and took the checkered flag at sunday 's @entity17 @entity16 through @entity18 , @entity3 struggled by comparison			1
double world champion @entity20 was the team 's highest - placed driver in fourth position , but the @entity23 finished over 30 seconds behind the victorious @entity18			1
" while we can take some satisfaction from the reliability shown by the @entity31 , it is clear that we have our work cut out to improve our car in order to compete on equal terms with the @entity11 team , " @entity24 told the team 's official website			2
@entity20 finished sunday 's race in fifth position , but he was elevated to fourth place after @entity41 's @entity40 -- who crossed the line in second -- was disqualified for breaching fuel flow regulations			1
@entity45 's @entity44 , who is starting his second spell as a @entity3 driver after winning the team 's last drivers ' championship in 2007 , finished seventh			1
like every team on the grid , @entity3 has had to contend with a raft of regulation changes introduced by the sport 's rule makers for the 2014 season -- including the introduction of 1.6 - liter @entity60 hybrid engines			2
@entity61 says his team is still coming to terms with the new rules , but he 's backed @entity3 to come back stronger than ever			2
" with all the new regulations this year , the opportunities to improve the car are legion and we can expect the race to improve the cars to be even more intense than normal , " he added			0
" our competitiveness was not acceptable in @entity74 , but we intend to fight our way back up the grid with the improvements that we will bring to the car			0
" meanwhile the @entity79 , the body which governs @entity2 , has announced its satisfaction with the fuel - flow meter which prompted @entity40 's disqualification from the @entity74 race			2
@entity40 was disqualified post-race after it was discovered his car had exceeded the maximum fuel - flow rate of 100kg/hour			0
allowing fuel to flow faster than permitted rate would give the driver an unfair power advantage over his competitors			0
the meter 's manufacturers @entity94 have received " positive feedback " from the @entity79			0
if @entity41 wishes to appeal the punishment , it must do so by midday on thursday			0
@entity40 will be back on the track for the @entity99 @entity16 on march 30 .			0
