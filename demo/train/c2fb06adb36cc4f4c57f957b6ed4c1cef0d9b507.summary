-- seven years after the sidelining of @entity3 , the goateed planter who conjured images of the @entity7 , the @entity1 has a new mascot to do antics for children , visit the sick in hospitals and , yes , cheer on the @entity13 at fall football games			1
@entity15 on thursday announced that @entity16 had outpolled other contenders to earn the honors , beginning in 2011			1
@entity20 - winning novelist @entity19 , whose home still stands near the campus in @entity23 , @entity1 , wrote a short story titled " @entity25			2
" in it , @entity26 stands as a symbol of pride , strength and toughness			2
extensive polling resulted in the bear defeating the @entity35 and @entity36 , based on a cheer exchanged between @entity15 fans , the mascot selection committee announced thursday			1
some @entity1 students had launched a campaign to put @entity41 from " @entity42 " on the ballot , but it fell short			1
about 13,000 people participated in each of two polls on the issue			2
the selection puts a symbolic end to @entity3 , who enjoyed lingering popularity among many @entity15 fans			1
the university for years has distanced itself from association with symbols of the @entity54			0
in 1997 , it effectively excluded presence of @entity54 flags at athletic events by not allowing any banners to be flown from a stick			0
" while we might not all agree with the [ student ] committee 's selection , i am confident that we will come together and continue to strongly support the @entity68 , " alumni association president @entity61 said			0
" i know that my love of @entity15 is as strong as ever , and that i will be in @entity70 on saturday night cheering loudly for our rebels			0
" the rebels will be on the road saturday playing the @entity74			0
it 's now up @entity76 to have the mascot ready to compete against the likes of @entity80 's garnet rooster , @entity81 , @entity83 's striped tiger , @entity84 , and the @entity87 's muscle - bound @entity85			1
" i was given the black bear and told ' make it happen ' , " said @entity76 , senior associate athletics director for communications and marketing			1
the school will work with a costume maker , recruit people who will wear the clothing and , perhaps most importantly , develop the creature 's persona			0
" i want it to be exactly right , " said @entity76 , who has been one the job a couple months			0
the cursive " @entity15 " script on t - shirts and other items have been the school 's main marketing tool			0
" the script is the brand , " said @entity76 , who believes the mascot will reflect old traditions and , ideally , create new ones			2
to that end , @entity16 will wear a sports jacket , tie and hat to gatherings at the @entity115 , the legendary game - day tailgating area and meeting place in @entity23			1
" @entity115 is such an integral part of our tradition , " @entity76 said			0
@entity16 likely will wear a t - shirt and " bring competitive energy to the game , " @entity76 said , adding mascots by necessity have to have a look and expression suitable for all occasions			1
" you want him to be intimidating , but not scary , " he said			0
" you want him to be serious , but light - hearted			0
" the university has done a good job of positioning its sports brands to get away from @entity7 stereotypes , @entity76 told @entity0			2
he knows @entity16 , at least initially , wo n't be welcomed by all			1
" no doubt there will be bumps in the road and there always will be critics			0
some say if they ca n't have @entity3 they would n't want a mascot at all			1
" but , he says , the school has an opportunity to attract new fans			0
" it 's what we do with the mascot that is important , " @entity76 said			2
" how it interacts with children , who are the future of the @entity1			0
" the colonel @entity155 tried in vain to get the old mascot , who was created before @entity160 , on the ballot			2
a commenter on its @entity164 page thursday lamented the new choice with the message , " @entity167 -- beware the @entity168 ! " the university announced in march that @entity3 merchandise was being phased out , and licensed sales were concluded by late summer			1
" because colonel @entity3 is a mark we wish to own as university property to prevent its inappropriate use by others and to avoid confusing consumers and @entity15 supporters , we are going to reclassify the mark as " historical " and add it to our college ' vault , ' " it stated			1
like just about everything else , @entity3 lives on @entity185 , in the form of phone covers , key chains and even a rubber duck , but the university does not profit from such sales .			1
