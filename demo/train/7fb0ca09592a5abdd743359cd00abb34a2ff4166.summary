-- six kids , one rv , 10 weeks and dozens of @entity4 states			1
a group of orphans from @entity7 has embarked on a journey from @entity9 to @entity10 and places in between , seeing more of the @entity4 than many @entity4 see in a lifetime			1
the road trip , which kicked off in january , is about " the kids getting an education in the landscape and history of @entity4 , " says @entity18 , an @entity4 who 's both their driver while in the @entity4 and a volunteer at their orphanage in @entity24 , the @entity7 capital			1
the four girls and two boys between the ages of 11 and 18 have seen the @entity28 and @entity29 , the @entity30 in @entity31 , and the @entity32 in @entity33			0
destinations down the road include @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity39 storytellers in the @entity40 , and nature hikes near @entity42 , before heading to @entity43 and back home to @entity7 in march			1
the youngest traveler is 11 - year - old @entity46 , who also goes by @entity47			2
she wears a fuzzy pink hat and scarf , loves pizza , and plays the trumpet			0
the boys , @entity53 and @entity54 , are 13 and 12 , inseparable			0
@entity54 dreams about being a filmmaker			0
the older girls -- @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 -- are 16 , 17 , and 18 , respectively			0
" it 's amazing , " @entity58 says of her @entity4 experience so far			1
" i like very much here			0
i learned more things and ( have had ) many experiences			0
" the kids are among an estimated 2 million orphans in @entity7			1
they are in the care of orphanages run by the @entity68 and @entity69 and were chosen for this trip because of their grades and academic achievements			2
the tour , funded by grants from the @entity4 @entity77 's @entity76 program and @entity78 , is also helping to raise money for the orphanages and building relationships between the two countries			1
pounds moved from the @entity4 to @entity24 to volunteer in the orphanage three years ago			1
he says the experience has changed his life , and he hopes the same type of travel experience can influence the children			1
" it was important to me to climb up into the mountains near @entity93 and see the village where many of the children come from , " he says			2
" it 's equally important for them to come and discover @entity4 , where their teacher comes from , to immerse themselves , to develop a worldliness , poise , communication skills -- everything a teacher values in education			1
" the rv -- or " @entity110 bus , " as they call it -- has everything they need for the road trip : plenty of beds , bathroom , kitchenette , refrigerator , stove , oven and microwave			1
and it 's hard to miss the big bottle of ketchup on the counter			0
outside the front passenger door , a sign reads " @entity130 " with a photo of the children			2
that 's spurred many impromptu meetings and kindness from strangers			0
" so many people have stopped us , to say hi and to meet the kids , " says @entity83			2
and when someone at the @entity141 rental company found out what the rv was for , @entity18 says , she gave the group a discount despite the almost 10,000 miles they expect to put on the vehicle			2
@entity18 is chronicling the experience in blog posts at the @entity149 orphanage site			2
" there 's laughter at every turn as these children grow by leaps , and deeply affect the people they meet , " @entity83 wrote after one day			2
the children all have similar stories full of heartache : parents dead from war or illness , or parents no longer able to take care of them because of drug addiciton , extreme poverty or other reasons			0
but sitting together inside the rv , the children reveal no bitterness or despair , only a determination to succeed			0
" we are the future of @entity7 , " says @entity58 , who wants to be an engineer one day			1
" we want to stay in @entity7 and help our country , " says @entity57 , who wants to be a doctor			1
also traveling with the kids is @entity176 , a teacher from the orphanage			1
she worries about the violence the children have witnessed and continue to see			0
" we have troops from all over the world and still no security , " she says			0
" @entity7 , especially the women , do n't feel safe			1
" her biggest wish : " feeling safe , and women having the same rights as men			0
" @entity18 says one of the best " sights " so far for the children has been witnessing women 's equality in action			0
" i think most notable is the freedom of girls and women to be in a position ... to be equal to men			0
that 's very outstanding to them			0
" the older girls say their sources of inspiration are not pop stars but rather the late @entity205 prime minister @entity204 and @entity207 democracy advocate @entity208			0
so the journey continues , until their flight back to @entity24 in march , just in time for @entity7 's @entity212 celebrations , called " @entity213			1
" " i hope by seeing @entity4 , these children work even harder for peace and stability in our own country , " says @entity176			1
and as they learn about all things @entity4 , they hope @entity4 come away with a deeper understanding of their world .			2

a group of kids from an @entity7 orphanage have begun a @entity4 road trip
the 10 - week visit to the @entity4 is part fund - raising , part awareness building
their teacher hopes it helps the children work harder for peace in their own country
