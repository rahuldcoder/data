-- tuesday will bring a spectacle in the night sky worth staying up for when the moon turns a burnt reddish orange			1
the moon will begin to change color at about 1:58 a.m. et tuesday as it starts to slide into the @entity9 's shadow until it becomes a " blood moon " at 3:07 et , @entity5 says			1
the best part of the show , the total eclipse portion , will last through 4:24 a.m. et. the height of the event will take place at 3:45 a.m. et. the big problem for potential viewers in the eastern @entity20 will be the cloud cover , which is expected to hide the show from half of the country , save for cities on the coastline , which might be able to peek through			2
but cities including @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 should have optimal viewing			0
@entity5 said the entire event can be viewed by people in the @entity34 , while observers in the western @entity36 will catch the second half of the event			2
the moon will be setting in most of @entity40 and @entity41 during the eclipse , so residents there probably wo n't see much			2
this one is just the first in a series of four consecutive total lunar eclipses			0
within a year and a half , @entity49 will be able to see a blood moon a total of four times			1
the moon takes on this color during the eclipse as it passes through the @entity9 's shadow , into which red light from the planet 's sunrises and sunsets shines			1
according to @entity5 , the exact color depends on what is in the @entity9 's atmosphere			1
the four blood moons will occur in roughly six - month intervals on the following dates : april 15 , 2014 ; october 8 , 2014 ; april 4 , 2015 , and september 28 , 2015			1
with that frequency , one might be misled into thinking that they are commonplace			0
what 's up with the ' blood moon ' prophecies ? there are about two lunar eclipses per year , @entity5 says			1
some of them -- penumbral , or barely visible , eclipses -- are so subtle , they go greatly unnoticed			0
other eclipses just cast a partial shadow on the moon but lend it none of that brilliant sunset hue			2
@entity84 eclipses -- penumbral , partial or umbral -- occur in random order , @entity5 says			0
getting four umbral eclipses in a row is like drawing a rare lunar poker hand of four of a kind			0
just like the poker players , astronomers have a name for that lucky draw			0
it 's called a tetrad , @entity5 says			0
" the most unique thing about the 2014 - 2015 tetrad is that all of them are visible for all or parts of the @entity20 , " longtime @entity5 eclipse expert @entity97 said in a prepared statement			0
in the 21st century , there will be many tetrads , but look back a few centuries , and you 'll find the opposite phenomenon , @entity97 said			1
before the dawn of the 20th century , there was a 300 - year period when there were none , he said			2
that would mean that neither sir @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 nor their contemporaries ever had a chance to see one			0
so , we 're in luck			0
for gazing geeks , @entity5 has set up a live web chat to answer questions about the eclipse starting at 1 a.m. et. tuesday 's blood moon comes right on time for the @entity135 holiday of @entity136 , which commemorates the ancient @entity138 ' exodus from slavery in @entity140			1
according to the @entity142 , @entity141 cast 10 plagues upon the @entity140 , the final plague being the death of the firstborn			0
the @entity138 painted lamb 's blood on their doorways so that this plague would pass over their homes			2
timeline of events 12:53 a.m. et -- the eclipse will officially begin but there will not yet be anything to see with the human eye			0
1:40 a.m. et -- observers should start to see some partial darkening along the left edge of the moon that will increase as the minutes pass			1
1:58 a.m. et -- partial eclipse begins : people will start to see the dark disk of the @entity9 's shadow crossing the moon			1
the shadow will advanced across the moon throughout the next hour			1
2:50 a.m. et -- as more of the moon becomes covered in shadow , observers should start to see parts of the dark shadow turn dark red or orange			1
3:06 a.m. et -- total eclipse begins with the moon completely in the shadow of the @entity9 and should appear reddish orange			1
the blood moon has arrived			2
3:45 a.m. et -- great eclipse : the middle of the total eclipse ; moon should appear dark red / orange 4:24 a.m. et -- @entity186 eclipse ends : @entity84 will begin to reappear from the shadow and coloration will begin to disappear			1
4:45 a.m. et - as more of the moon emerges from the shadow , the color should be mostly gone			1
what is left will appear black			0
5:33 a.m. et -- partial eclipse ends as dark shadow completely leaves the moon , which will return to its normal look over the next 10 - 20 minutes			2
6:37 a.m. et -- @entity197 officially ends			0
send us your photos of the moon to @entity202			0
@entity0 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0

just before 2 a.m. et , people will start to see the @entity9 's shadow crossing the moon
the moon will turn a *copper* red for just more than an hour
there will be four ' blood moons ' within a year and a half , and many in the 21st century
watch it beginning about 1:58 a.m. et tuesday
