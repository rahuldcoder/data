-- winning a @entity1 can help bring a divided country together , but that sense of unity can all too easily be dissipated , according to @entity6 's @entity5 , who helped his country secure football 's greatest prize on home soil in 1998			1
@entity12 's squad was seen as representing as a new @entity6			2
@entity5 himself was born in @entity17 , @entity15 came from @entity18 , @entity19 from @entity20 , @entity14 's family hailed from @entity21 , while others were of @entity24 and @entity25 descent			2
@entity6 's win was widely viewed as a rebuke to @entity28 -- former leader of the right - wing @entity30 -- and his anti-immigration stance			1
" it was fantastic because we won it and we won it at the right time because i think politically , @entity6 was going through a difficult period and i think we won the @entity1 and we showed to the @entity6 nation what @entity6 is really , " @entity5 , who was eligible to play for @entity6 through his grandfather , told @entity0			1
" we had the players from all around the world and i think we showed the diversity of the @entity6 national team , we showed what the diversity of the @entity6 people are			0
" that 's why it was really important to win the @entity1 because we sent the message to the political world what we need to accept and what is the real face of @entity6			1
" he added : " we saw @entity57 was going crazy but not just @entity57 , @entity6 was going crazy and it just looked like a @entity6 revolution -- people in the streets celebrating and it was fantastic and this is when i really realized how football can be powerful			0
" @entity58 , though , can only do so much , and @entity5 , who won 107 international caps , feels that those running the country missed out on a golden opportunity to enable @entity6 to capitalize on that new found unity			1
" when we won the @entity1 , we saw the change but the change was there just for a while and i think that is the problem with politics , " said @entity5			2
" things change really quick and people were using the success of the national team to promote themselves and that was a big issue , " he said			0
" but i think winning the @entity1 changed a lot of things for people because it gave people more belief , more confidence in themselves , how they can adapt and stand up for what they think is right , and i think it helped people to fight against racism and i think that was good			2
" sixteen years after les bleus ' @entity1 success racism is still a problem in @entity6 and last year the country 's most prominent black politician @entity84 was featured on the cover of the far right weekly magazine with the words : " @entity93 as a monkey , @entity84 gets her banana back			1
" antisemitic attitudes are also prevalent			0
former @entity6 international @entity96 was banned for five matches and fined Â £ 80,000 ( $ 135,000 ) in february for making a " quenelle " gesture -- a sign believed to be an inverted @entity101 salute -- although the striker denied that it had any antisemitic connotations			0
" with what is going on in @entity6 , i feel the country is still divided because i think religion and people taking part try to divide people , " @entity5 said			1
" i think we have to accept our differences and the way to accept it is education			0
i think we have to even promote more education			0
" i think we have to talk more about our differences and not be ashamed of it and just accept who we are as a person and try to accept other people 's differences as well , and i believe this is part of a lack of education			0

@entity5 says winning the @entity1 in 1998 helped to unify a divided @entity6
but @entity5 feels the nation 's politicians did not do enough to build on the success
promoting education is key to *solving* @entity6 's current racial problems , says @entity5
