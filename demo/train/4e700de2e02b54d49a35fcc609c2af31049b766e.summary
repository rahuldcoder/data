@entity0 -- a year after a @entity0 , subway crash killed nine people and injured dozens , federal accident investigators on tuesday blamed faulty track circuits for the wreck , but also criticized the numerous local and federal entities entrusted with keeping passengers safe			1
the @entity10 said the june 22 , 2009 , accident was preventable			2
its report said the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) failed to ensure that a verification test developed after an earlier incident was used system - wide			1
the test would have identified the faulty track circuit before the accident , the @entity10 said			1
the accident near the @entity21 on the system 's @entity22 occurred when one train struck the rear car of a stopped train			0
automated systems should have prevented the two trains from occupying the same stretch of track at the same time			0
" the layers of safety deficiencies uncovered during the course of this investigation are troubling and reveal a systemic breakdown of safety management at all levels , " @entity10 chairman @entity31 said			2
@entity31 said the safety board hopes the accident will be a catalyst for change at @entity13 and lead to greater federal oversight and improved safety standards for rail transit systems nationwide			0
the board said a " lack of a safety culture " within @entity13 contributed to the accident , as did ineffective oversight by @entity13 's board of directors and the @entity50 , a little - known organization responsible for overseeing @entity53 safety			1
the safety board also said the @entity60 's " lack of statutory authority " contributed to the situation			0
a federal law passed in 1965 prohibits the federal transit authorities from setting standards for local subway systems			0
following the @entity53 accident , the @entity66 administration proposed changing the law to allow the federal government to set standards and increase oversight of local subway systems			1
earlier this year , the @entity10 added improved subway car design to its list of " most wanted " transportation safety improvements			2
the safety board is recommending that the government set standards for the ability of transit cars to withstand crashes , as well as the ability of passengers to get out of damaged cars .			0

a federal report criticizes the safety record of @entity0 's subway system
