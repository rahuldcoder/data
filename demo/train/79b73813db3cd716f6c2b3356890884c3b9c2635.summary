@entity2 , @entity3 -- " do you ever listen to stories ? you do			2
you do n't even know you do			0
also you tell stories all the time			2
" @entity6 receives the @entity7 in 2007 at the age of 88			1
very neatly , master storyteller and @entity7 - winner @entity6 spells out mankind 's addiction to storytelling			1
stories occur naturally to people in one form or another , and finding reasons for their existence is unnecessary , according to the 89 year - old author			2
" it is so deep in all of us			0
storytelling is obviously some part of our minds , because it 's always going on in one way or another			1
" @entity6 regards her own propensity for telling stories as a lifelong duty			1
born to @entity32 parents in @entity33 ( now @entity33 , ) she began writing at seven , and says it was her innate capacity for it , rather than inspiration which got her started			1
" i was born to write , as other people are born to paint ... that 's all , " she says , " writers tell stories			1
this is what we do			0
" much of @entity6 's fiction is based on her experiences growing up in @entity47 ( now @entity48 ) , where she moved as a young child			1
she was raised on storytelling in the time - honored fashion -- she was read to and told stories by her mother , going on to spin her own tales for her younger brother			1
as she grew older these childhood stories somehow morphed into the powerful fiction she has become known for , bravely tackling the harsh social and political realities of her upbringing			1
her first novel , " @entity61 " was published in 1950 after she moved to @entity2 , and fearlessly dissects the tension between oppressed black @entity63 and white colonials			0
arguably her most famous and influential work , " @entity65 , " meanwhile is held by many critics as one of the most important feminist novels ever written			0
when she was awarded the @entity7 last december , the @entity70 academy called her " the epicist of the female experience " who had " subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny			1
" @entity6 's prodigious writing skills are all the more impressive since they are largely self - taught			1
her formal education ended at age 13 when she dropped out of a school in the @entity80 capital @entity81 , and she left home at 15 to work as a nursemaid but remained a voracious reader -- " i educated myself by reading			0
" she also started writing stories and later sold two of them to magazines in @entity89			1
@entity6 has never forgotten the importance of reading as a way to educate yourself ( " you know there are some people in the world who still do " ) and feels strongly about helping people in developing countries to gain access to books			1
" [ there are ] places where there is no proper education			0
in large parts of @entity89 for example , you find them begging for books			1
" in her acceptance speech on receiving the @entity7 , she painted moving pictures of the desperate struggle for knowledge people in some developing countries still endure : " not long ago a friend who had been in @entity48 told me about a village where people had not eaten for three days , but they were still talking about books and how to get them , about education			2
" she strongly advocates storytelling as an essential part of childhood , and claims there is a distinguishable difference between the attitudes of people who grew up reading books , and that of those who grew up with television and whose parents feel television and the @entity133 are satisfactory substitutes			2
people brought up on books are " infinitely better informed , better educated " than those who do n't have a genuine passion for reading instilled in them , says @entity6			2
the storyteller , on the other hand , needs to be aware of the potential power of their words			0
@entity6 has firm principles about her work : " i do n't write what i do n't believe , or i do n't write anything which i think is wrong			2
" this uncompromising attitude coupled with her anti-apartheid campaigning helped get her and her books banned from @entity47 and @entity89 in the 1950s			2
half a century later the left - wing radical has become a grand old lady of the literary scene			0
unimaginably , her latest book , " @entity154 and @entity155 , " released this year , will be her last			0
the book presents the effect of @entity158 on her parents , and in the first of the novel she imagines what their lives would have been like had that terrible event never happened			0
" for my father it was easy , he always wanted to be a farmer , in @entity169 , or @entity170 , or somewhere			0
so i 've given him the life he wanted			0
and my mother , who was an extremely clever woman -- i 've given her a life where she could use all these abilities , which she never had the chance to do in her own life			0
" the second half is a more faithful account of their experiences during the war , and how distant they were from the lives they wanted			0
perhaps her graceful exit with " @entity186 " was intended to demonstrate a deeper value to storytelling			1
much more than an exercise in imagination or controversy , it opens the door to an endless universe of second chances .			0

writer @entity6 spells out mankind 's dependence on stories
lessing on storytelling : " it 's always going on in one way or another . "
her own life is itself a great story : born in @entity33 , she grew up in *southern* @entity89
