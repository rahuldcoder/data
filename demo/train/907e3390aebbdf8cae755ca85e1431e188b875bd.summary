" what i told them essentially is , if we are going to play hardball , both sides can play and i was a pretty good pitcher in my day			0
" " the question begs to be asked , why would the attorney general 's office decide not to tell me ... and why did they go to his house and take him out in handcuffs ? " @entity53 said			2
" i think the answer is self - explanatory			0
" @entity53 said he expected his client might not be able to post the $ 250,000 bail before thursday because he did n't have time to make the arrangements			1
