@entity0 is in full awards season mode			0
this past weekend , the producer 's @entity2 granted its first tie for its best picture award , bestowing the honor on " gravity " and " 12 years a slave			0
" this weekend , the director 's guild will hand out its awards , for which " 12 years a slave " director @entity13 is a strong favorite			1
if @entity13 takes home the @entity16 at next month 's @entity16 , he will be the first black director to receive that honor — ever			1
which is a pathetic reflection of the far deeper and more enduring inequalities in @entity22 society today			0
it was n't until 1991 , the 64th presentation of the @entity16 , that a black director was even nominated : @entity26 for " @entity27			1
" only one black director has been nominated since : @entity29 in 2009 for " @entity30			1
" meanwhile , excluding @entity13 this year , only four black men have been nominated as producers for best picture : @entity34 for " @entity35 " in 1985 , @entity29 for " @entity30 , " @entity36 for " @entity37 " in 2009 , and @entity38 for " @entity39 " in 2012			1
and no black women have ever been nominated as either directors or producers			1
the record is n't much better for white women , incidentally			1
before @entity48 , who became the first woman to win the @entity16 for best director -- in 2010 for " the @entity51 " -- only three women had ever been nominated : @entity53 for " @entity54 " in 1976 , @entity55 for " @entity56 " in 1993 and @entity57 for " @entity58 " in 2003			1
and the bigger box office films , including many nominated for @entity16 , tend not to include female producers			2
one might be forgiven for thinking the 86th annual @entity16 are taking place in 1886			2
as far as we 've supposedly come as a society — a black president , more women in the workplace , the important legislative and cultural accomplishments of the civil rights movement and the women 's movement — that 's all ? three black directors , four white female directors and a handful of executive producers between them ? seriously ? these discouraging patterns in the @entity16 nominations and awards are a reminder that social progress can be disturbingly superficial			1
just like the world around us , our movie screens appear to be increasingly more diverse			0
incredibly talented actors of color are at times portraying profound roles in plots that relate to the struggle for racial justice in @entity22 , usually through the lens of our past -- from " @entity92 " to " @entity39 " -- rather than an uncomfortable and critical look at our present			2
yet @entity0 fails to regularly create , let alone celebrate , any near - significant number of critically and commercially successful films created by black directors and producers with as much power and pull in @entity0 as their white counterparts			2
when @entity103 hosted the @entity16 in 2005 , he took a camera crew to a movie theater in @entity106 in @entity107 and asked audience members if they 'd heard of that year 's @entity16 - nominated films			2
rock simply and powerfully illustrated the profound disconnect between black @entity22 and the @entity0 elite			0
@entity103 was not invited to host the @entity16 again			0
these observations no doubt lead to chicken - vs. - egg debates			0
after all , plenty of financially successful films each year are produced and directed by black men and women -- though mostly men			1
so is it that these movies do n't make it into the critical pantheon of the @entity16 ? or black producers and directors do n't have the same opportunities to create films in the more elite genres ? does the reason even matter or just the result ? by the same token , does @entity0 exclude women and people of color in powerful director and producer roles more than other facets of @entity22 business and society ? probably not , but who cares ? that does n't make the critique any less worth leveling			1
in 1939 , @entity143 became the first @entity144 to win an @entity16 , for her role in " @entity146			0
" in 1968 , @entity147 became one of the first @entity144 - @entity22 actors to achieve major box office success in a leading role , with a string of hits that year , including " @entity154			0
" but both black actors , and most since , have been fictionally and literally in white men 's houses ; white men still very much disproportionately occupy the real seats of power in @entity0 and beyond			2
kudos to @entity13 for challenging this tired script			0
i hope his truly excellent film wins both best picture and best director			0
but more important , here 's hoping the behind - the - scenes levers of power in @entity0 start reflecting more inclusive plot lines appropriate for 21st century @entity22 .			0

@entity172 : if @entity13 wins , he will be the first black director to get an @entity16
@entity172 : no black women , only two other black men have been nominated for best director
@entity172 : only four white women nominated for director : as far as we 've come , this is pathetic
@entity172 : movies show racial struggles of the past but neglect to take a look at the present
