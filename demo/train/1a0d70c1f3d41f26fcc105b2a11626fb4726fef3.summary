@entity0 , @entity1 -- stopped at a red light in a crime - wracked neighborhood of @entity0 , @entity1 , a 31 - year - old woman watched as her friend slumped to the floor after a bullet smashed through the back window of the 31 - year - old 's @entity11 minivan			1
" i looked back and there was a gunman walking up on my car , " said the driver , who declined to be named out of concerns for her safety			0
" i turned away and he fired two more			0
" as the shots rang out , she turned the wheel and hit the gas to escape what turned out to be the second fatal shooting that day in @entity0 , where nearly a sixth of the city 's police force was laid off amid budget cuts about two years ago			1
and @entity0 is by no means unique in implementing police cutbacks to save city money			1
meanwhile , violent crime soared 18 % nationwide last year , marking the country 's first rise since 1993 , while property crime also spiked for the first time in a decade			1
" hurry up , i ca n't breathe , " mouthed wounded @entity36 , after the gunman unloaded three rounds at the minivan where she was sitting with her friends just before midnight on october 1			2
the group then raced toward @entity0 's @entity42 , but the 24 - year - old mother of two began to lose consciousness			1
one of the bullets had punctured her lung , her family said later			0
" when they got her on the gurney she kept saying ' i 'm dying , i 'm dying , ' " the driver recalled			0
" ' please do n't let me die			0
' " @entity36 hung on until about 3 a.m. the next day , just hours after another victim died in a hail of gunfire in an unrelated incident about a mile away in the city 's @entity56			0
her death is one of at least 71 homicides so far this year in cash - strapped @entity0 , where police say they have reorganized after more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in november 2010			1
last year the city tallied 74 murders through october , while violent crime soared despite earlier drops in the first years of mayor @entity69 's administration			1
police expenditures in @entity0 have since declined every year for the last three years , according to the city 's business administrator , @entity71 , leaving cops to sustain public services with decreasing resources			1
analysts say the trend is n't unique			1
" most cities have cut back since 2008 and the recession , though some more than others , " said @entity80 , a spokesman for the @entity81			2
municipal administrators nationwide have since struggled to fill budget gaps amid declines in state aid , a sputtering economy , high employment and slowly rising costs in things like health care and public pensions			0
according to the @entity96 - based cities organization , the effects of the financial crisis are also " increasingly evident in city property tax revenues in 2012 , " after dropping 3.9 % nationwide last year and thereby bringing in fewer dollars for municipal services			1
in short , the overall pie has gotten smaller , say city officials who point to the hundreds of public sector layoffs in @entity0 in 2010			1
" we 've been in process of reducing our expenses pretty aggressively for the last three years , " said @entity71 , who touted improvements in the city 's tax collection efforts to help with the revenue side of the equation			0
" naturally there 's a period where the rubber hits the road and there 's not that much left to cut			0
" but last year @entity0 ended up with an $ 18 million surplus in state aid , prompting @entity117 gov. @entity117 to state that he was n't happy with the city 's 2012 requests for more assistance			1
" i do n't need @entity1 's largest city in any more financial trouble than it 's in already , " the governor told reporters earlier this month , dispatching state officials to " force budget cuts			2
" still , in 2010 , @entity0 's mayor said police layoffs were an " unfortunate situation that was entirely avoidable , " and blamed the cuts on an unwillingness by police unions to negotiate needed reductions in the wake of the financial crisis			1
@entity69 said improvements in technologies and partnerships with federal agencies would help in the fight against crime , and pledged to sustain the number of officers patrolling the streets			2
but city police union vice president @entity145 has argued that both patrols and detective squads have since been reduced , and that " all the technology in the world wo n't replace the bodies you need to respond to crime " and build proactive policing			2
meanwhile , town and city halls in places including @entity156 , @entity157 ; @entity158 , @entity159 ; @entity160 , @entity161 ; and @entity162 , @entity163 , have tentatively put public sector jobs on the chopping block this year to help fill budget gaps			0
in january , the mayor of crime - ridden @entity168 , @entity1 , nearly halved its police force while cutting close to a third of its fire department in an effort to close a $ 26.5 million budget deficit			1
and as @entity177 's fiscal health continues to assume center stage on the campaign trail , how the nation will deal with its debts in the days after november is largely expected to play out in some way on the streets of cities like @entity0 , @entity156 and @entity168			2
a silver lining may be that it 's finally forcing the discussion			0
" we 're now having that frank public conversation about what do we want from government and how much do we want to pay for it , " said @entity188 fellow @entity187			0
law enforcement typically makes up large portions of most municipal budgets and is often considered a prime target for cutbacks			0
" every department is facing the same kind of issues of downsizing , " said @entity200 director @entity199			0
" everybody has significantly less amount of police officers and you know there has to be a point where that comes to an end			1
" @entity0 residents such as @entity214 , who was a close friend of @entity36 's , say they 've become frustrated with the response from police , though they are equally disturbed by the so - called " snitch code " that keeps neighborhood witnesses quiet and away from authorities out of fear of retribution			1
@entity0 is listed as one of only a handful of @entity1 cities that maintain gangs with more than 200 members , according to a state survey			2
" i know ( police ) are overwhelmed , " @entity214 said			0
" people are dying but we want cops on the street doing something , " she added			0
earlier this month , police arrested a 42 - year - old city resident who is suspected in @entity36 's murder .			2

in cash - strapped @entity0 , more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in 2010
analysts say the trend is n't unique -- several cities have cut police forces to save money
meanwhile , violent crime rates soared 18 % nationwide last year
in @entity0 , one *senseless* street shooting puts the statistics into terms of human *tragedy*
