a judge 's ruling that the city of @entity3 can move forward with bankruptcy and strip the city 's public workers of their modest pension benefits will have a devastating impact on @entity3 's middle class — many of whom are @entity13 — and the city 's ability to rebuild a strong and sustainable economy			1
the largest municipal bankruptcy in our nation 's history , the @entity3 decision charts a course where @entity24 banks and bondholders are at the front of the payment line while city residents , police officers , firefighters and other public employees are left at the rear , with only pennies			1
@entity34 , @entity3 's unelected emergency manager , misled the public and succeeded in setting a dangerous precedent that will have ripple effects for other cities and states still struggling to get back on their feet in the post-recession economy			2
@entity44 gov. @entity43 and @entity34 , a former corporate bankruptcy lawyer , frequently cited the figure of @entity3 's $ 18 billion in long - term debt as the reason the city must declare bankruptcy			1
according to a recent report , " the @entity55 , " written by former @entity58 investment banker @entity56 , not only is $ 18 billion an inflated and inaccurate estimation of @entity3 's long - term debt , it is irrelevant			1
unlike corporations , cities can not be liquidated , therefore cash flow , as opposed to long - term debt , is what must be addressed			0
opinion : @entity3 , the ' used to be ' city @entity3 has a cash - flow shortfall of $ 198 million			2
despite the blame placed on public pensions , the truth is that @entity3 's path to insolvency had little or nothing to do with pensions , which average just $ 19,000 per year for most employees and $ 30,000 per year for police and firefighters , who are not eligible to receive @entity76			1
there were several drivers of @entity3 's downward spiral : a depleted tax base : the city 's wealthier white population has declined by 1.4 million since the 1950s , leaving behind an almost entirely @entity13 and much poorer population			1
the remaining tax base continues to decline as unemployment stays stubbornly high : in 2008 alone , the number of working @entity3 residents dropped by roughly one - quarter , further diminishing the city 's income tax receipts			1
property tax revenue also dropped precipitously as home values went through the floor			0
skyrocketing financial costs : @entity24 banks saddled @entity3 with $ 1.6 billion in loan deals that were highly profitable for @entity24 , but exposed the city to risk it could not afford to take			1
the banks have already extracted $ 300 million from @entity3 to terminate these interest rate swaps , and are posed to collect another $ 300 million in additional windfalls			0
corporate subsidies and tax loopholes : while public workers were laid off and had salaries cut , @entity3 gave away millions of public revenue in tax loopholes and subsidies to big corporations			1
a wealth of research finds that tax breaks like these are ineffective and it is apparent they have done little to create good jobs for @entity3 residents			0
these tax breaks should be on the table , just like other obligations of the city in resolving the cash - flow crisis			0
the dynamics at play in @entity3 are the same dynamics creating the growing wealth gap and keeping our economy from making a lasting and sustainable economic recovery			1
while @entity24 and corporations profit handsomely from a city 's decline , public workers — the city 's middle class — have sacrificed time and again			2
in recent years , thousands of public workers were laid off , and the remaining public employees accepted a 10 % pay cut , health benefit reductions and a 40 % cut in future pension benefits , saving @entity3 $ 160 million			0
not only is it immoral to force the working people to give up even more in the name of fiscal responsibility , but these cuts will only burden the effort to solve the city 's long - term challenges by depressing economic activity , pushing more residents into poverty , and making it difficult to retain and attract needed workers			0
instead , @entity3 's cash flow shortfall must be addressed by fixing the problems that caused it in the first place			2
banks must be told that they have profited enough from interest rate swaps that helped create this mess and will receive no more			0
the state needs to collaborate by increasing available revenues			0
corporate tax loopholes must be closed and ineffective subsidies ended			2
like other cities , @entity3 can work its way back toward a healthy local economy with good jobs , quality public services and a robust tax base			0
but making that happen depends on honoring the promises made to workers and ensuring that @entity24 and big corporations pay their fair share .			0

@entity176 : stripping @entity3 's workers of their modest pensions will kill middle class
