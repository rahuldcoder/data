-- the ceo of the @entity3 company behind a huge toxic spill on thursday said he does n't know whether he 's responsible for the disaster , but added , " i have moral duties and i will fulfill them			1
" @entity7 , the chief executive of the @entity9 aluminum plant , spoke with @entity0 's @entity10 a day after he was released from jail pending trial			1
@entity7 was detained on monday , accused of public endangerment and harming the environment			1
" it 's said i should be responsible although i do n't feel it , " @entity7 told @entity15			1

@entity7 argued that the problems presented by the reservoir and the accumulation of toxin in it stretched back 25 years or more			2
but he added that it is his " moral duty " is to " help " and put his energies " 120 - percent into the aid effort			0
" @entity7 categorically denied that a hole was present in the reservoir in the days or weeks before the spill happened			1
@entity7 said he had visited the reservoir in the weeks before the spill happened			1
but , he said he had n't seen the photo released by the @entity33 showing one of the pools of sludge -- a byproduct of the process to turn bauxite ore into aluminium oxide -- leaking into a nearby field			0
the @entity42 says the photo was taken in june			0

the @entity3 government announced wednesday that @entity9 would resume operations by the end of the week			2
meantime , as cleanup operations continued , workers were racing to complete three emergency dams designed to contain a possible second toxic spill from the plant			2
@entity3 emergency services officials said more ruptures and cracks are evident in the dam walls , and that it 's just a matter of time before they break and spill an additional 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge across the countryside			1
nine people died after a river of mud engulfed the villages of @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 last week			0
more than 100 people were injured and many times that number had to be evacuated			0
the sludge from the spill reached the @entity89 -- @entity91 's second - largest river -- within days , raising fears of wider contamination in @entity3 and countries downstream , including @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and the @entity99			2
but water rests released friday found that the ph level of the @entity89 water was only slightly higher than normal			0
@entity104 toxins experts still have nothing conclusive on the exact chemical composition of the sludge			0
aluminum and bauxite processing normally involves compounds that include arsenic , cyanide , cadmium and chromium			0
