-- i 'm struck by one big question as i watch the @entity4 presidential candidates battle each other while president @entity6 tries to win re-election : why does anyone want to be president ? it 's like auditioning to be bandleader on the @entity11			1
and yes , i said bandleader and not captain because the captain of a ship has more of an impact on the direction of a voyage than president @entity6 , or any president who might follow him , can have in our hyperpolarized political climate			1
with the onslaught of problems he faces today , i would n't be shocked if in the coming weeks president @entity6 appeared on national tv and declared : " i have an important announcement : i was actually born in @entity27			1
@entity29 you take over , i 'm outta here ! " but he wo n't quit			2
instead , he will raise close to a billion dollars for his re-election campaign			2
meanwhile , the @entity4 presidential candidates will viciously fight each other , like gladiators in the @entity33 -- which , frankly , the past two @entity4 debates resembled			2
the audience jeered and booed , with some at times even applauding the death penalty and cheering the notion of allowing a person with no health insurance to die			2
all that was missing was a thumbs up or down from the crowd indicating if a candidate should be executed			0
( @entity44 , too , would undoubtedly have been met with cheers			0
) think about it : when you run for president , you are running for the worst job in @entity50			1
if elected ( or re-elected ) you must deal with a cascade of domestic and international headaches			0
but to me the greatest challenge facing our president ( or a new president ) is not the economy or the @entity60 debt crisis			1
it 's not the growing influence of @entity63 , the @entity64 or even the issue of @entity67 statehood			0
nope , the biggest challenge the president faces is us			1
" simply put , we are horrible			0
we have become unreasonably demanding			1
we want everything now and we wo n't compromise			0
" @entity70 " have become @entity72 from " @entity73 , " making demands in our high - pitched voices : " i want a goose that lays golden eggs and i want it now ! ! " " i want the deficit reduced now , @entity79 ! " " i want low taxes but the same government services ! " and if you wo n't give us what we want , when we want it , we will turn our back on you			0
for example , president @entity6 had almost a 60 % approval rating after the killing of @entity89 in may , but just four months later , a recent poll shows , his approval rating is at 39 %			1
the left wants him to be more liberal , the right wants him to be more conservative and the middle just wants more			0
the @entity4 presidential candidates have seen this , too , with @entity97 being at first welcomed into the race like the " prodigal son			0
" now , only a few weeks later , he looks more like a doomed @entity101 satellite about to fall from the sky			0
what has caused us to become so demanding ? the 24 - hour news cycle and social media that allows instant real - time commentary have contributed			1
but an even bigger factor is our conditioning to reality show competitions on tv			1
on any number of tv shows each week , we watch , judge and vote on whether a person performs to our liking			0
one week we sing their praises , but the next week , if they misstep , they are dead to us			0
we now treat our candidates this way			2
it 's a presidential version of " @entity121 , " where we want to fire -- or at least dissect and scrutinize -- the president and presidential candidates for every small gaffe			2
i have seen better treatment for contestants on @entity129 's " @entity128 " than for our candidates for president			2
if this keeps up , what type of candidates for president will we attract in the future ? will it be the smartest and the most qualified or those who , like reality show stars , can weather the cruel glare of an unending spotlight and the fickleness of our affection ? even reality - show veteran @entity145 's skin was too thin to run for president , which is shocking since his skin looks like leather			1
and , yes , that snarky comment is just the kind of thing i 'm talking about , but i 'm no better than the rest of us			0
since this seems to be what we crave , why not commit 100 % to it and create political reality shows to choose our future presidents ? what about shows like : " @entity162 , " " dancing with the candidates , " or " so you think you can govern ? " we can vote people off until we are left with the man or woman who has survived by telling us exactly what we want to hear each and every week			1
but if we do n't take a break from this " @entity172 " mentality , we will have no one to blame but ourselves when the 2016 presidential campaign pits @entity175 " against the @entity176			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			1

@entity179 : with politics so hyperpolarized , who would want to be president ?
so many challenges , he says , but the biggest is unreasonable , demanding voters
he says we treat political leaders like reality show players , up one day , down the next
@entity179 : we run risk of ending up with leaders who tell us only what we want to hear
