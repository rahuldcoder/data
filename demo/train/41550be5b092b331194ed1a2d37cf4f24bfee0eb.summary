@entity0 the @entity2 that has done virtually nothing for two years is wrapping up 2014 with a bang			1
dozens of policy provisions are tucked into a 1,603 - page bill that will keep the government open through next september			1
the provisions affect everything from campaign finance laws to financial regulations , marijuana possession and even the government 's purchase of white potatoes			1
the bill , which was negotiated between @entity17 and @entity18 over several weeks , is expected to get a vote in the @entity20 on thursday -- right as @entity0 faces a deadline to avert another government shutdown			1
the provisions are notable because @entity20 @entity18 leaders frequently tout a transparent process			0
but some of the items added at the last minute to this massive funding bill were never discussed in any committee hearing , or voted on as part of any of the nearly dozen spending bills that were rolled into one package to result in the 1,603 - page legislation			1
house speaker @entity33 defended including all these so - called " policy riders " in the spending bill on wednesday			1
" understand all these provisions in the bill were worked out in a bi-partisan , bi-cameral fashion or they would n't be in the bill , " @entity33 said			1
here is a quick list of some of the changes : blocking new marijuana legalization bill in @entity0 : voters in @entity0 approved a measure to decriminalize recreational marijuana use last month			1
but @entity2 has authority over the city 's finances , so the bill bars the @entity52 from using any of its own money or federal funds to regulate the use of pot. wealthy donors allowed to give more to political parties : the bill increases the individual limits that donors can give to national parties to help fund conventions , building funds and legal proceedings , such as recounts			1
the change would effectively allow rich donors to give ten times more than they can today to support political parties			0
republicans who pushed for the change say they are substituting more private money for the taxpayer money that was collected for national political campaign committees , but instead used to fund a pediatric cancer bill that passed earlier this year			2
more wheat bread for school lunches : republicans wanted to block new nutritional requirements for school lunches under a program championed by first lady @entity82			0
but instead of wiping out the rule , @entity18 and @entity17 agreed to give local schools more flexibility on how they decided to include whole grain items on school menus			2
the sage grouse faces uncertain future : the @entity90 wanted to add the sage grouse - a type of bird found in some western states - to the endangered species list , but @entity18 argued that would have a negative economic fallout for energy companies developing resources in those states			0
no more taxpayer money for expensive portraits : committee chairs and other high ranking government officials in @entity0 often commission large , often very pricey portraits of themselves to hang in hearing rooms			0
under the bill they would need to use private money to pay for any new portraits			2
old fashioned light bulbs still allowed : the bill blocks new energy efficient standards that would have made incandescent light bulbs obsolete			2
consumers had complained about the new requirements			0
white potatoes get top billing : a new provision was added requiring that the @entity120 that provides food assistance to low income families include fresh vegetables , and includes an explicit requirement for white potatoes			1
truckers wo n't be required to get more sleep : safety advocates wanted to require truck drivers to get a full two night 's sleep before beginning their new shift on the road , but the bill blocks that requirement			2
farmers get a reprieve from some clean water rules : the deal prevents the @entity138 from enforcing some of its clean water act rules in some agricultural regions			0
@entity143 prisoners ca n't come to the @entity144 : the bill bars money for transferring any detainees held at the facility in @entity149 , @entity150 , to any prisons in the @entity144 banks allowed to use taxpayer money to engage in potentially risky trades : the bill rolls back a provision that was part of financial reforms for @entity158 banks			1
it reverses a rule that was enacted in 2010 that barred banks from using taxpayer backed funds from trading in derivatives			0
@entity17 argue these often risky trades helped contribute to the financial collapse in 2008			2
blocks @entity165 from targeting certain groups : the bill prevents any federal money to be used by the @entity165 to target any advocacy group based on their ideological leanings			2
this practice is already not allowed , but @entity18 wanted to underline it after internal documents showed that some @entity165 employees targeted some groups when investigating their tax - exempt status			0
new sexual harassment training for @entity179 staffers : the measure requires the chief administrative officer , the office that oversees the thousands of aides working on @entity184 , to develop an online training program focused on sexual harassment			0
earlier this year , @entity187 was caught kissing a member of his own staff			0
what the bill does n't do : the bill does n't block the president 's executive action on immigration			0
conservatives wanted to use the spending bill to strip away money for any agencies tasked with implementing the president 's new policy			1
but the legislation continues funding for the @entity203 through the end of february			0
the deal does n't roll back any major portions of @entity207 - it allows for continued funding at the current levels			0
last fall the @entity18 's effort to defund the health care law as part of the spending bill resulted in a government shutdown , a move leaders pledged they did n't want to repeat this year .			1
