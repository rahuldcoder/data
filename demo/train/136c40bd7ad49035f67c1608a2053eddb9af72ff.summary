-- we do n't yet know how heavy a blow @entity2 will deliver to the @entity3 when it hits			1
but mindful of the devastation that @entity9 left in its wake , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 , and @entity7 have declared states of emergency and evacuations have begun			2
public officials and emergency managers are getting good at getting people out of harm 's way			1
unfortunately , where official plans are likely to fall short is in helping evacuees to quickly return to their storm - damaged communities and get back on their feet			1
the kind of levee system failure we saw with @entity9 in @entity27 in 2005 is not likely to be repeated with this storm , given the $ 14 billion investment that the @entity29 is close to completing			2
harder hit will be the people along the @entity7 , @entity6 , and @entity4 coastlines and in low - lying inland areas with no levee protection			1
but it 's making communities safe enough for residents to return to quickly that is so important , because packing up and running away from the weather is so expensive			2
the average @entity3 family fleeing the storm will have to dole out and estimated $ 250 to $ 300 a day for food and lodging			1
with the economy still foundering , and the unemployment rate for most of the @entity3 region still above 8 % , plenty of folks have no savings to pay for shelter or even to fill the gas tank for the drive inland			0
those who must leave their jobs behind will have smaller paychecks to draw on when the credit card bills arrive at the end of the month			0
the longer they must stay away , the greater the financial setback they will face			0
while the media satellite trucks are likely to leave shortly after @entity2 passes , plenty of hardship stories will be left to tell once @entity3 evacuees are allowed to return to their homes			1
residents will almost certainly face the same kinds of challenges they experienced seven years ago in the aftermath of @entity9			0
our elected officials all recognize the high political cost of failing to respond to a disaster as it unfolds , and will do whatever it takes to earn good marks			1
but despite the painful experiences the @entity3 region has endured in the aftermath of recent storms , the path to recovery will still be a rocky one			2
@entity87 , state and local government officials have not resolved many of the bureaucratic and insurance - related issues that slow restoring services , paying out legitimate claims and making repairs			1
damage assessments have to be made and questions about liability and coverage have to be resolved for homes and businesses that are destroyed			2
in public spaces , cash - strapped agencies have to determine who is responsible for clearing debris and cleaning up spills of hazardous materials			0
to date , too little attention has been paid to streamlining these processes			0
when government falls short in meeting the immediate needs of victims , nonprofit and faith - based relief organizations often step in to fill the void			2
but long before @entity2 started churning through the warm waters of the @entity3 , relief organizations throughout the @entity3 were already under severe stress , trying to serve nearly one - fourth of the region 's residents who have a chronic need for assistance			1
and with charitable giving down below 2007 levels , churches and small community - based organizations have had to cut back on staff and make painful cuts in the social services they provide			2
what this means is that the ultimate safety net for the neediest populations may be one of the victims of @entity2			1
these organizations will require early and substantial outside assistance			0
the storm will provide yet another vivid display of nature 's menacing capacity for destruction and disruption as @entity141 gather in @entity142 , @entity5 , and a few days before @entity143 descend on @entity144 , @entity145			0
organizers for both national conventions have promised programs that will offer up contrasting views of the role of government			0
@entity2 will provide a reminder that managing messy real world challenges does not lend itself to simple formulas favored by political partisans			1
when it comes to assuring the safety and well - being of @entity160 , the truth lies somewhere in the middle			0
responding to and recovering from disasters require individual and local resilience on the one hand , and capable and competent government at all levels -- local , state , and federal -- on the other			0
throughout this election season our political parties have been busy highlighting what divides us			0
but disasters have a way of teaching lessons that should unite us			0
when catastrophic events happen , it is the decisions and actions of local officials and everyday people that are key to survival			1
but when it comes to planning evacuations , maintaining levees , and supporting the speedy recovery of communities leveled by a storm -- government matters			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 and @entity196 .			0

**writers** : @entity2 evacuations start ; officials have gotten good at getting people out
but many evacuees ca n't afford the $ 300 a day it takes to live away from home , they say
**writers** : officials have not resolved issues that keep people from returning quickly
nonprofits , churches are low on funds ; government must do more to help recovery , they say
