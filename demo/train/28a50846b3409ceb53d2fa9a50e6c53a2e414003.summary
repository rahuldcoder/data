-- @entity1 found itself in a bit of hot water this week when it was revealed that a casting agency in @entity6 only desired light - skinned @entity8 actors for the company 's @entity11 commercial featuring @entity13 and @entity14			1
the company apologized , but that has n't stopped a lot of the chatter criticizing @entity1 for not doing more to keep the casting agency in check			1
this really is n't a new story considering how many times in the past we 've heard similar stories , including that advertising agencies have non-urban dictates like refusing to buy advertising space on black - focused radio , tv , magazine and online properties			1
worldwide , nearly $ 500 million is spent on bleaching products , an effort for people with darker skin to lighten their skin			1
this is pretty laughable considering the lengths some whites go to darken their skin through tanning beds or even spray painting a bronze look in order to appear darker			1
( i 'm still trying to figure out the skin tone of speaker of the house @entity45			1
) but there is another critical discussion that must be had , and that is the belief that the lighter skinned you are , the better your life will be			1
the effects of this mindset are examined in the documentary " @entity57 , " produced by actor / director @entity55 and directed by @entity56			2
" @entity57 " explores the pain that is associated with having dark skin , even re-creating the white doll - black doll studies made famous by dr. @entity61 , which played a crucial role in the @entity65 decision			1
facilitator : show me the smart child			2
[ a black child 's hand points to the fairest - skinned depiction among a spectrum of drawings of a little girl , identical , save for the skin color )			1
facilitator : and why is she the smart child ? child : ' cause she is white			2
show me the dumb child			2
[ the little girl , who is brown - skinned , points to the drawing of the child with the darkest skin )			1
facilitator : and why is she the dumb child ? child : because she black			2
facilitator : well , show me the ugly child			2
[ again , the little girl points to the darkest drawing )			0
facilitator : and why is she the ugly child ? child : ' cause she black			0
facilitator : show me the good - looking child			1
[ the little girl points to the fairest drawing			0
] facilitator : and why is she the good - looking child ? child : ' cause she light - skinned - ed. i talked to @entity106 and @entity56 on my @entity108 show , @entity107 , and both said the results of the documentary were stunning when considering how pervasive skin color plays a role in the minds of kids , even at an early age			1
" unfortunately , i think we 've accepted values that set standards of beauty that are not us , " @entity55 said			0
" and as a result of that , as you saw the small child , unfortunately , at a very , very , very young age , whatever they look like is not beautiful enough			0
and so they try to be something other , and we sell them products to do that , and i think whoever 's selling that ad thinks in the same way			1
" in the documentary , one woman fighting back tears tells the story of a friend who recently had a baby : " it was my first time seeing the baby , and the baby was beautiful			1
and she said , " girl , i 'm so glad she did n't come out dark ! " in addition to the @entity1 controversy , there have been complaints that on album covers and magazine ads , the skin of @entity149 , who is already light - skinned , is made even lighter to make her appear white			1
even when it comes to dating , some black men have the view , " light is bright ; she 's alright			2
" " in our film , we have a young man saying he does not think a dark - skinned girl looks right on his arm			1
he says that in the camera , " @entity55 said			0
" he says long hair , fair skin - he feels better with that person on his arm			1
" @entity56 says it 's vital that we have real discussions about this issue			0
" i want to continue what has happened six months ago when we dropped the trailer on everybody -- to know that -- to recognize that there is an issue with us , and then start the healing process , " he said			0
" if you recognize that you have an issue , and then open up about it and start talking about it , that 's when the healing begins			0
" so with our film -- we 're not psychiatrists , or psychologists , or sociologists , @entity186			0
we 're just filmmakers who decided to point a lens at this particular subject , this issue , to say , ' listen			0
this is how we can fix this , possibly			0
just open up and talk about it , ' because , as @entity55 says , you 're not going to find anything outside of yourself to heal this			0
it 's going to come from within			0
" while " @entity57 " ( www.officialdarkgirlsmovie.com ) makes its way across the country , @entity106 and @entity56 are working on their next documentary , which will deal with light - skinned black women			1
even that is a serious issue ; even to the degree that some blacks still pass for white in the 21st century			0
just last year , my @entity207 died in @entity209			0
she lived most of her adult life as a white woman , even though she was black			2
her daughter , who is married to a white man and passes for white even though she knows she 's black -- but her kids do n't know -- waited two months to tell my grandmother that her only surviving sister had died			2
why ? because she was afraid of her black relatives showing up and exposing their secret			0
how 's that for a post-racial @entity220 ?			0
