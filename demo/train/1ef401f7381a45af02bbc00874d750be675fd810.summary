a federal appeals court thursday blocked a ruling that deemed the @entity3 's stop - and - frisk policy unconstitutional , while removing the judge from the case as other appeals are heard			1
the three - judge panel of the @entity8 said the lower court judge " ran afoul " of requirements that judges avoid even the appearance of impropriety			1
judge @entity14 , the appeals court said , jeopardized " the appearance of partiality ... by a series of media interviews and public statements purporting to respond publicly to criticism of the @entity22			2
" @entity14 , in a related 2007 proceeding , said , " if you got proof of inappropriate racial profiling in a good constitutional case , why do n't you bring a lawsuit ? you can certainly mark it as related , " adding , " i am sure i am going to get in trouble for saying it , for $ 65 you can bring that lawsuit , " the ruling said			2
@entity34 appealing stop - and - frisk ruling the ruling also points to interviews with the @entity38 , the @entity39 and @entity40 in which the judge spoke about her personal beliefs on the issue and defended her decision			1
the stop - and - frisk policy -- in which police stop , question and frisk people they deem suspicious , even if they 've committed no crime -- has been one of the most controversial policing techniques in recent time , fueled by clashes between civil rights and civil liberties groups challenging the practice as racist and illegal			1
law enforcement and other proponents say the practice works to reduce crime			0
in august , @entity14 ordered that the stop - and - frisk policy be altered , finding that it is unconstitutional in part because it unlawfully targets blacks and @entity66			1
city officials had bristled at the contention that police racially profile suspects and appealed the ruling			0
@entity14 , ruled that the policy violated plaintiffs ' @entity74 rights barring unreasonable searches , finding that police made at least 200,000 stops from 2004 to june 2012 without reasonable suspicion			0
she also found evidence of racial profiling , violating plaintiffs ' 14th amendment rights guaranteeing equal protection			0
the panel did not rule on @entity14 's decision in the case			2
@entity87 , counsel for the @entity34 @entity88 , applauded the appeals court 's ruling			2
" we could not be more pleased with the court 's findings , " he said , because the ruling puts off a decision on the constitutionality of the policy until another judge can weigh in			1
the nonprofit organization representing the plaintiffs in the case criticized the ruling			0
" we are dismayed that the @entity105 saw fit to delay the long - overdue process to remedy the @entity3 's unconstitutional stop - and - frisk practices , and we are shocked that they cast aspersions on the professional conduct of one of the most respected members of the federal judiciary and reassigned the case , " the @entity103 said in a statement			1
thursday 's ruling effectively stalls changes mandated by @entity14 , who said stops should be based on reasonable suspicion and made in a racially neutral manner			0
her ruling called for the appointment of a former @entity122 prosecutor to develop reforms of the @entity3 's policies and a pilot project in which @entity3 patrol officers in five precincts -- one in each borough with the most stops in 2012 -- must wear video cameras			1
outgoing mayor @entity131 is an outspoken proponent of the policy , saying it saves lives and lowers crime			0
@entity3 commissioner @entity137 was forced to cancel a speech at @entity139 on tuesday after protesters shouted at him on stage about stop - and - frisk policies			1
on thursday , @entity137 said he has been " concerned about the partiality of @entity144 , and we look forward to the examination of this case			0
" the controversy about the policy extended into the mayoral race			0
@entity152 nominee @entity151 , who is heavily favored to win tuesday , has made his opposition to stop - and - frisk a major campaign issue			1
" i 'm extremely disappointed in today 's decision			0
we should n't have to wait for reforms that both keep our communities safe and obey the @entity160 , " he said in a statement			0
@entity162 nominee @entity161 said , " @entity163 ! as i have said all along , judge @entity14 's biased conduct corrupted the case , and her decision was not based on the facts			2
