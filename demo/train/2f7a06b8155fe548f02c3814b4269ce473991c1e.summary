-- the district attorney of @entity2 , @entity3 , says he can not say if he would have signed an indictment against the parents of @entity6 -- the 6 - year - old beauty queen killed in 1996 -- as a predecessor declined to do three years after the child 's death			1
" i do n't know if i would have made the same decision , but i know how difficult these decisions are , " @entity11 wrote in his first comments after the release of the indictment			1
previously sealed court documents released friday show that a @entity3 grand jury voted in 1999 to indict @entity18 and @entity19 , @entity6 's parents , on charges of child abuse resulting in death and being accessories to a crime			1
but then - district attorney @entity26 said there was insufficient evidence to warrant filing charges , and he did not sign the indictment			2
from the beginning , @entity30 and his late wife maintained they had nothing to do with their daughter 's death			2
his lawyer has said there was no evidence to prosecute them , and they were later exonerated by dna tests			2
@entity11 , who took office in 2009 , wrote a lengthy op - ed in sunday 's @entity46 of @entity2 explaining his position on the case , which captured national media attention after the little girl was found dead in her family 's home the day after christmas 1996			1
@entity11 wrote that he had his staff look at the case after he took office four years ago			1
his appellate department told him the statute of limitations had run out on the charges in the indictment			2
as for any other charge , the @entity61 's staff found nothing to pursue , he said			1
@entity11 wrote he will not comment on the case -- at this time			1
" my , or my staff 's view of what the evidence in the @entity30 case proves will only be stated in open court if a case is ever filed , " he wrote , adding the @entity65 are entitled to the " full presumption of innocence			1
" @entity30 attorney wants full review on friday , an attorney for @entity30 and his family urged @entity11 to publicly open " the entire grand jury record and not just four pages from an 18 - month investigation that produced volumes of testimony and exhibits			1
" the released indictments " are nonsensical , " said attorney @entity85			0
" they reveal nothing about the evidence reviewed by the grand jury and are clearly the result of a confused and compromised process			1
the @entity30 family and the public are entitled to the benefit of the full and complete record , not just a historical footnote			0
" @entity85 , in a statement , said the grand jury did n't have what was later to be " the conclusive 2008 dna testing that led to the unequivocal , public exoneration of the @entity30 family by the @entity2 district attorney			0
" that year , another district attorney , @entity107 , wrote a letter to @entity30 , saying that new dna evidence tests had cleared him , his late wife and their son			0
she formally apologized for the cloud of suspicion the @entity65 had lived under for years			0
@entity11 wrote that a district attorney 's job is to seek justice , not to forgive , " and rarely to ' exonerate			1
' " he said he believes " straying from this role can be very confusing to the public and can create false impressions of certainty about uncertain evidence , subject to conflicting inferences , that has never been presented and tested in open court			0
" ' a killer on the loose ' the @entity30 case has never been tried , something that frustrates the community , @entity11 wrote			1
" because no case has ever been brought against anyone in ( the ) @entity30 ( case ) , the community has had no resolution and the tabloid press has been free to speculate , sometimes recklessly , based on only parts of the evidence , " he said			2
in the days after the killing , @entity2 police and the media focused on @entity18 and @entity19			0
the parents always insisted that an intruder had killed @entity6			1
" there 's a killer on the loose , " @entity19 said a few days after her daughter 's body was found			0
" i do n't know who it is			0
i do n't know if it 's a she or a he , but ... there 's someone out there			0
" investigators say they did not find any sign of forced entry into the family home in 1996			1
no footprints were found in the snow outside the home , either			2
a paintbrush from her mother 's hobby kit was used to tighten the rope that choked @entity6 , according to investigators			1
an alleged ransom letter came from a notepad inside the house and made reference to little - known details about the family 's past finances			0
in october 1999 , grand jurors assigned to the case went back home , sworn to silence			1
the eight women and four men had convened regularly for 13 months			0
they heard from dozens of witnesses , considered 30,000 pieces of evidence			0
today , the investigation stands almost where it started -- no arrests and no solid suspects			0
documents unsealed judge j. @entity187 last week ordered the release of four pages of sealed documents , as requested by @entity2 journalists			0
the court documents show how the grand jury sought to charge each parent with two identical counts			0
the grand jury had alleged that @entity19 , who died from ovarian cancer in 2006 , and @entity30 " did ... permit a child to be unreasonably placed in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child 's life or health which resulted in the death of @entity6			1
" the grand jury also had alleged that each parent " did ... render assistance to a person , with intent to hinder , delay and prevent the discovery , detention , apprehension , prosecution , conviction and punishment of such person for the commission of a crime , knowing the person being assisted has committed and was suspected of the crime of murder in the first degree and child abuse resulting in death			0
" the documents provide no further details on who that " person " was			0
the grand jury had accused the couple of committing the offenses " on or between december 25 and december 26 , 1996			2
" @entity0 legal analyst @entity230 said the indictment merely shows that a majority of the grand jurors felt there was probable cause to charge the parents -- a lower standard than proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .			2

' i know how difficult these decisions are , " @entity11 writes
he says staff has reviewed case , which remains *unsolved*
parents owed presumption of innocence , he writes
@entity6 was killed in 1996 in her parents ' home
