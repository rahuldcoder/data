-- rep. @entity1 , @entity2 , who is under investigation by the @entity4 , said tuesday she has not been given due process and she " will not be a sacrificial lamb for anyone			1
" the 10 - term congresswoman is alleged to have helped steer federal bailout money to a bank in which her husband had a financial stake			1
in a radio interview with @entity0 contributor @entity15 on the @entity17 , @entity13 said she is " not guilty of any violations " and she " want [ s ] to go to trial			1
" the @entity4 released a report monday detailing three counts against @entity13 and rejected her request for the charges to be dismissed			1
the 71 - year - old @entity13 has been pushing the ethics panel to set a trial date before the midterm elections in november			1
but she told @entity15 tuesday she does n't expect that request to be granted			2
" that 's one of the issues of not having due process			2
when in the heck are you going to set up this hearing ? we are on break and we do n't think it 's going to be before the november election , " she said			2
@entity13 , a senior member of the @entity40 , helped arrange a meeting in september , 2008 , between @entity43 - based @entity42 and @entity44 officials , according to ethics investigators			1
@entity42 ultimately received $ 12 million in bailout funds			0
according to the report , @entity13 ' husband owned almost 4,000 shares of @entity42 stock at the time of the meeting			1
the shares had declined in value from more than $ 350,000 in june to $ 175,000 at the end of september -- the height of the @entity59 financial crisis			0
@entity13 , according to a separate preliminary report , called then - treasury secretary @entity61 " and requested that @entity44 officials meet with representatives from the @entity64 , " an organization representing more than 100 minority - owned banks			1
" a meeting was in fact granted , however , the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- @entity42			2
rep. @entity73 ' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and , at the time of the meeting , was a stock holder of the bank , " the report said			1
but @entity13 reiterated tuesday that " the meeting was set up for @entity64 -- for all the minority bankers			1
just like you have a representative for the chamber of commerce or for the @entity83 , etc. , that 's what the meeting was for			0
" she said @entity87 , @entity42 's chairman and chief executive officer , spoke up at the meeting , " and said , ' i 'm an example of what 's happening with minority banks ' and went on to try and make his case for the fact that @entity42 was losing $ 50 million that they had invested in @entity97			0
" " it just so happens that some of the officers -- at least one of the officers of @entity42 -- happens to be the chairman of the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) , " the congresswoman said			0
the report also states that @entity13 approached @entity40 chairman @entity105 , @entity43 , to say that she was " in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank , but ' @entity42 people ' were coming to her for help			1
" @entity13 , " according to ( @entity105 ) ... knew she should say no , but it bothered her			1
it was clear to ( @entity105 ) that this was a ' conflict of interest problem			0
' " @entity105 's advice to @entity13 , the report states , was to ' stay out of it			1
' " in the @entity123 interview tuesday , @entity13 admitted she had spoken to @entity105 , but described the circumstances much differently than the report			1
" i did n't go to him for advice			0
i went to him and told him , ' these are your constituents			0
they are headquartered in your district and they are now trying to find @entity133			0
we 're representing the @entity64 , ' " @entity13 said			1
" so then i said , ' perhaps you need to take a look at this ' and he said , ' @entity138			0
you do n't have anything to do with this			0
i will take care of it			0
' and , as a result of that , he started to work on it			0
the report released monday stated that @entity13 " agreed to refrain from advocating on behalf of @entity42 , " but failed to instruct her chief of staff , @entity148 , from doing so			1
following the september 9 meeting between @entity44 and @entity64 officials , @entity148 " was actively involved in assisting @entity42 representatives with their request for capital from @entity44 and crafting legislation to authorize @entity44 to grant the request " for financial assistance , the report said			0
" reasonable " people could construe @entity148 's " continued involvement in assisting @entity42 as the dispensing of special favors or privileges to @entity42 , " the report concluded			0
@entity13 refuted that allegation as well tuesday			1
" if you 're going to wrap this all around creating these violations because i failed to supervise my staff , it does n't hold water , they do n't have any proof of that and i maintain that i want to go to trial or whatever they want to call it -- adjudicatory hearing -- because i think i do n't deserve this , " she said			2
@entity13 is the second high - ranking @entity180 now facing a public ethics trial this fall			1
@entity183 rep. @entity182 , the former chairman of the tax - writing @entity184 , has been accused of 13 violations of @entity4 rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of @entity189			2
the prospect of inquiries into the two high - profile @entity192 has compounded the fears of congressional democrats nervous about their prospects in mid-term elections in november			2
the growing likelihood of trials for @entity13 and @entity182 also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation			2
both representatives are leaders of the @entity203 , and @entity42 is one of the largest minority - owned banks in @entity206			0
@entity13 alluded to race tuesday on @entity209 's show , which is broadcast over the internet on @entity211			2
" the @entity212 ( @entity212 ) is poorly constructed			0
you do n't know who is charging you with what or brought a claim against you or who brought the information to the @entity212 ... of all the information claimed or accusations brought to them , they think that african - americans are the only ones who they move further with investigation on , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity226 contributed to this report			0
