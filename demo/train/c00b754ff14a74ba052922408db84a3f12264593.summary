-- @entity1 wanted to look on the bright side			1
@entity1 , who says she 's " fed up with negativity , " was revitalized by the election of @entity5			1
and who could blame her ? in the past decade , @entity7 -- perhaps best known for her @entity9 - winning 1993 album , " @entity11 " -- had faced a political climate she did n't agree with , as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer , which she was diagnosed with in the late ' 90s			1
songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle , crystalline voice			1
" it was ... horrific , " she said simply			2
however , with her latest album , " @entity22 " ( @entity23 ) , @entity7 is as focused and passionate as she has been in years			1
sparked by the changes in her life and @entity27 politics , she said , music has been vital to her personal resurgence			2
" it was nice to focus on things outside of my body			2
music has always done that for me , " she said			2
describing herself as someone who was " fed up with negativity , " @entity7 was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen			2
" [ the ] @entity27 people will not let this country collapse , " she said			2
the idea motivated her to look at her country 's dark path of injustice not so long ago , stories that worked their way into her songwriting			1
" in some ways , i 'm just a journalist			2
i [ want ] my audience to hear these stories , " she said			2
@entity0 spoke with @entity7 from her home in @entity56 , @entity57			2
@entity0 : being a folk singer and your views being what they are , was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008 ? @entity1 : it was very difficult for me			1
i was hurt by the direction my country was going in			2
and then , after [ the 2008 election ] , everything came spilling out			1
things came along like the @entity72 case ( " @entity22 " ) , where @entity73 died , and i read her obituary			1
[ the @entity76 were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in @entity81 at the time			2
] that was such an inspiration			0
... just wondering why i never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage			0
bit by bit , my heart started to open up again , and i could write ! @entity0 : had you ever gone through that before ? @entity7 : no , never in my life			0
i 've always been a very prolific writer			0
@entity0 : now , what about writing in the age of @entity5 ? @entity7 : ( laughs ) it feels great ! people may be down on their luck , financially			1
but i see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [ general ] openness			0
@entity0 : now , in addition to " @entity22 , " there are other songs based on actual events on this record			1
tell me about " @entity109			0
" @entity7 : that 's based on @entity112 's case in @entity113 [ @entity57 ]			1
he was robbing a @entity114 -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in , and an officer was killed			0
now , @entity112 did n't kill him ; it was friendly fire			0
@entity112 was convicted anyway and executed			0
i 'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty , but this case really stunned me , because i feel like this country has evolved enough to where we should n't have to live with the death penalty			0
@entity0 : is it hard as a writer / musician to inhabit those songs , knowing that they are actual events ? @entity7 : not really			0
i feel like , in some ways , i 'm just a journalist			0
i do n't express my opinion [ in the songs ] , necessarily			0
but it 's important to me that my audience hear these stories			1
i want as many people to know about loving v. @entity81 as possible			0
@entity0 : do you feel like it 's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it ? @entity7 : i do			1
i 've been informed many times through music			0
@entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 ... so many folk songwriters			0
it 's all around you			1
@entity0 : the song " @entity154 " -- i suspect that 's about president @entity156 ? @entity7 : it 's about people like him			1
this country is full of them , and especially my home state of @entity162			0
it 's a [ perspective on ] people who go through life getting away with everything			1
@entity0 : do you feel a sense of vindication with president @entity5 's election , or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you 're in favor of ? @entity7 : i hope so			1
right now , he is my hero			0
@entity0 : what in your past steered you into a topical songwriter ? @entity7 : i was always more interested in story songs , things with a point of view ... and things that informed me			0
@entity0 : is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like " @entity188 , " which is clearly more personal ? @entity7 : there is a burden to writing [ those topical songs ] : you better have your facts straight			0
when you 're writing a personal song like " @entity196 , " it 's straight from your heart and seems to just flow			1
@entity0 : " sing " seems like it would fit that description			0
does that song sum up your life in a way ? @entity7 : many have asked that , but i was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with @entity206 where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career			0
it 's not something you choose			1
it 's just what you do .			1

@entity1 's new album is " @entity22 "
