-- after hiking along the @entity2 for more than two years , @entity1 is suddenly in a rush			1
the native @entity4 , who set out to become the first person to walk all of the river 's roughly 4,000 miles more than two years ago , is hoping to finish his hike on monday , in time to catch his scheduled flight home to @entity10 from @entity11			1
despite collapsing from exhaustion on a roadside sunday morning , @entity1 is confident he 'll make the plane			1
" feeling much better , " he wrote in a blog post from northeastern @entity11 on sunday , after catching three hours of sleep			0
" ... will walk all night from now to complete the remaining 85 kilometers			0
" it 's the kind of fortitude that @entity1 has summoned time and again since setting out from the @entity2 's @entity2 source in @entity20 in april 2008 , seeking to raise international attention about rain - forest destruction and to help raise funds to combat it			1
since then , @entity1 and @entity25 -- a @entity20 forestry worker who joined him in july 2008 -- have encountered pit vipers , electric eels , anaconda , mosquitoes and scorpions , but very few doubts about whether they 'd reach the @entity34			1
" after grabbing something to eat , and replying to emails i finally got my head down at 1:27 a.m. , " @entity1 wrote in a piece for @entity0 last week , after hiking for 15 straight hours			1
" we 've never walked 55km in a day before so we are satisfied with what we 've achieved , if a little stiff			0
" @entity1 , a former @entity42 army captain , and his hiking buddy have seen their share of setbacks			1
@entity1 contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis , a skin disease , and had to have a botfly removed from his skull			2
@entity51 suffered a nasty machete cut			0
but their biggest challenges were far less dramatic			0
" although everyone would like me to say that the hardest thing has been our encounters with ( indigenous residents ) pointing bows and arrows at our chest , for me that was n't the hardest part , " @entity1 said last month , " ... the adrenalin kicks in and you deal with exciting , potentially dangerous moments like that easily			2
" " it 's been the mundane that had really challenged me , " he said			0
" ... the weight of the rucksack , the basic food , the constant mosquito bites , the constant thorns			0
the little things that in a two - day expedition would n't bother you have been the things that have actually been challenging			0
" the greatest pleasures of the journey , @entity1 said , have been the warmth of the @entity11 people , with village children frequently welcoming him and @entity51 to new towns and their parents offering home - cooked meals			2
having never visited the @entity2 before starting his expedition , @entity1 now says that his quest to save the region wo n't end with his hike			1
" i 'm committed now to this place for the rest of my life , " he wrote on @entity0 this month , " and i intend to take ' walking the @entity2 ' around the world and keep alive the stories of the people we 've met along the way , the lives in the @entity2 and the tale of the jungle			0
" though he says that deforestation means the @entity2 " is changing faster than many of us can comprehend , " @entity1 has also found reasons to be hopeful about its survival while hiking			1
" although ( deforestation ) is sill going on in the moment , " he said , " there 's a generation coming through @entity11 that are very aware of environmental issue and really do care about the @entity2			2
" as he closes in on the @entity2 's mouth , @entity1 has found time to nurse less lofty desires			1
he says the first thing he 'll do after touching down in @entity115 is grab a pint of beer			0
and his @entity20 partner , he says , ca n't wait for a pint of fresh milk .			2
