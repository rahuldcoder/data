-- @entity1 may have forgotten to thank her fianc√© , fellow country music star @entity2 , when she won her first @entity3 this february			1
but when we caught up with the 27 - year - old star on her tour , @entity2 was top of mind			1
in fact , the @entity10 native was thrilled to chat about everything , from her energy secrets to how she 's getting into peak shape to swap " i do 's " with @entity2 this month			1
q : you 're in @entity17 , @entity18 , now			2
do you ever get confused about which city you 're in ? a : yes ! they usually write where we are on the set list , because i 've made the mistake of saying the wrong state before			2

] q : and how do you keep your energy up on stage ? a : i eat a lot of protein and eat pretty clean			1

i had to share my room with a woman and her kids who had been abused			1
@entity0 : 8 reasons to make time for family dinner q : what was the healthiest thing about your childhood ? a : we had a farm and a garden , and for about two years we literally lived off the land			1
we raised rabbits and chickens , and also had our own hogs that we slaughtered			0
we did n't really go to the store for anything besides milk			0
my mom would say , " go pick out what you want for dinner , " and we 'd go in the garden and get whatever vegetables we wanted			0
it was really old - school and really awesome			1
q : was it hard slaughtering animals that were your pets ? a : @entity133 would give us two rabbits as our pets , or we 'd have one pig we could name			1
they explained that not every animal was a pet -- some were providing for our family			0
it sounds weird to other people , but i look at it like , there are some animals you feed and some animals that feed you			0

we balance each other out			0
he 's constantly joking , and i 'm more serious			2
he can make me laugh at any point			0
especially when i 'm trying to be mad , he 'll go , " are we in a fight ? " and then i 'll start laughing and go , " i guess not now			2
" q : he must understand the pressure of being in the public eye			0
it 's not enough anymore to just be a singer -- you have to look great , too			0
is that tough ? a : absolutely			0
the bigger you get , the more pressure you have to deal with			0
the hard part is i 'm a normal - size girl , and i 'm fine with that			1
