-- screaming children are the bane of many a single passenger			2
now , amid all the grumbles of childless passengers and harassed parents , airlines are offering the warring factions a chance to sit further apart			0
. recently , @entity10 , @entity12 's budget brand , became the latest carrier to unveil child - fee seating zones			1
the program , called " @entity10 in @entity16 , " follows on the heels of @entity18 -- the long - haul arm of the @entity21 budget carrier -- launching a " quiet zone " on their flights			1
the operations are similar : under - 12s are banned from the zones and cordoned off from the remaining passengers via a curtain , galleys and the exit doors ( the space that usual separates business class from economy )			1
contrary to how it might seem , @entity36 , @entity18 's ceo , maintains the measure is as much for the benefit of families as it childless travelers			2
" it 's cute how some parents have written back and said , ' this is a brilliant idea , ' because they feel less stressed and guilty if their child is restless			1
now , if someone 's giving them an evil stare , they can just say , ' well , if you 're going to complain , you should have sat in the quiet zone			2
' " in general , @entity18 assigns random seats , unless passengers pay a $ 15 fee allowing them to choose where to sit			0
whether that choice is to perch at the back of the plane grouped with spouses and spawn , or up front , where it 's free from minors , the fee is the same			1
by introducing quiet zones , @entity36 is hoping to drive passengers , be they families or singles , towards paying the fee			2
so far , it 's been successful -- the number of passengers paying to choose a seat has risen " several percentage points "			0

" i kind of viewed it less about cordoning off children , and more as just another way for airlines to charge fees , " she says			0
still , some airlines argue the measure is more operational			0
@entity90 has taken a different if similar track on their @entity95 - @entity94 route , where they have introduce a curtained " women only " section in the last four seats of economy			1
the idea is to give women privacy to breastfeed and do their makeup			0
the seats do n't generate any added income , but they do help free - up the bathrooms			1
" about 60 % of our passengers are women , and the in - flight lavatories are always crowded before landing			1
this resolves the long line , " says @entity111 , a spokesperson for the airline			0
@entity79 says that to a certain extent , passengers segregate themselves			0
" while kids are cute , they can definitely be a distraction , especially if you 're trying to get stuff done for work			0
that 's why a lot of businessmen chose to sit in economy plus			0
meanwhile , a family of four or five usually wants to sit together , and it 's easier for them to do that in the back , " she notes			0
interactive : which airlines have wi - fi ? @entity135 's @entity134 has taken a different approach			1
rather than separate the two groups , they 've introduced " @entity141 , " an in - flight team of child experts that play with , calm and otherwise distract children from causing a scene			1
" we looked at what it 's like to enter an aircraft from a child 's perspective			1
many are small , and it 's daunting to board a plane and not know where you 're going , or to have to sit there and not be able to walk around , " explains @entity150 , the vice president of guest services			1
@entity134 has paired up with @entity157 , @entity158 's premier childcare institute to train the all - female staff of nannies on child psychology , sociology and child development			1
the carrier hopes to have 500 trained by the year 's end			2
the nannies , who are recognizable by their bright orange aprons , can help with feedings and give advice on diaper changing , though their main purpose is to entertain			0
they come armed with a special kit , full of cardboard , crayons , colored paper and star - shaped stickers and will help kids create anything from sock puppets to paper animals			0
" it 's about making them feel special , which also makes them feel calm , " explains @entity150 .			2

@entity10 is the latest carrier to offer child - free zones .
@entity90 has a small , women 's only section on their @entity94 route .
@entity134 has introduced in - flight nannies to calm children aboard their flights .
