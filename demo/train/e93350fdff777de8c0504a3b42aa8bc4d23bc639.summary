-- @entity2 president @entity1 stood firm sunday against global calls for him to step down , insisting that his vision should be the foundation of any future solution to the country 's crisis			1
in a rare public speech , @entity1 lambasted those who want to " fragment @entity2 " and accused foreigners of helping fuel terrorism on the ground			1
" those are the enemies of the people and the enemies of @entity17			0
and the enemies of @entity17 will go to hell , " the president told a packed auditorium of supporters			0
@entity22 laid out a plan for a solution to the crisis , which he said should start with regional countries ending their support for " terrorists			1
" the government frequently describes dissidents as terrorists			0
the president 's plan includes a national dialogue as well as the writing of a new constitution that would be put up for a public referendum			2
but there 's a major caveat to the plan : @entity22 said he will not deal with " terrorists " -- a description that , in his view , includes the vast majority of the opposition			1
similarly , opposition members have said they will not work directly with @entity1 's " criminal " government , nor will they accept any solution that does n't involve @entity1 's departure			1
@entity53 's @entity52 calls for trial of @entity1 " there can be no solution to the conflict in @entity2 until he is pushed out with his team			1
his speech is continuing the war against the @entity2 people , " said @entity59 , vice president of the @entity60			1
in a statement , the opposition coalition described the speech as a " preemptive strike against both @entity69 and international diplomatic solutions			0
" @entity22 is incapable of coming up with a viable political solution to the crisis , the opposition coalition said , because he insists on remaining in power " despite being rejected by his people and his traditional allies			1
" but just as he has throughout @entity2 's 22 - month uprising , @entity1 refused to acknowledge the widespread movement inside his country seeking an end to four decades of his family 's rule			1
he claimed many of the opposition fighters are not @entity2 , but rather foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the nation			1
" we are facing an external attack against us , which is more dangerous than any other previous wars , " he said			0
" we are dealing with those who are extremists , who only know the language of killing and criminality			0
" @entity95 foreign secretary @entity94 described @entity1 's speech as " beyond hypocritical			2
" " deaths , violence and oppression engulfing # @entity2 are his own making , empty promises of reform fool no one , " @entity94 tweeted			2
similarly , @entity105 spokeswoman @entity104 criticized @entity1 's speech , saying it was " yet another attempt by the regime to cling to power and does nothing to advance the @entity2 people 's goal of a political transition			1
" @entity22 has " lost all legitimacy and must step aside , " she said			1
as the president spoke , the violence carried on unabated			0
" i have heard 10 shells fall during the speech , " resident @entity116 told @entity0 from @entity117 , a suburb of @entity118			0
heavy shelling from missile launchers also hit the @entity118 suburb of @entity125 during the speech , the @entity121 said			0
the opposition group reported that at least 101 people were killed in violence across the country on sunday			2
the president 's address , carried live on state - run tv , was @entity1 's first since june			1
since then , tens of thousands of @entity2 have been killed , and the country appears no closer to a resolution			2
during his last publicized speech in june , @entity1 called for unity			2
" we are in a state of real war , in every aspect of the words			0
and when we 're in a state of war , all of our politics has to be concentrated on winning this war , " @entity1 said at the time			2
but during the seven months since , reports from inside @entity2 suggest rebels are gaining ground			2
the battles between @entity1 's forces and rebels are raging closer to the president 's doorstep , with some of the fiercest fighting taking place near @entity118			1
more than 60,000 people have been killed in the @entity2 civil war , according to the @entity159			1
the crisis , which started in march 2011 , began when peaceful anti-government protests led to a fierce crackdown by the government and spiraled into and armed uprising and civil war			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports of daily violence inside @entity2 , because the government has restricted access by journalists			0
in an open letter friday , @entity170 , head of the @entity60 , implored the @entity172 and world leaders to take action			0
" our people are subjected to genocide , and our country is being destroyed as the international silence is only encouraging the regime to commit more crimes against humanity , " he wrote			0
" halting massacres in @entity2 is an international obligation everyone should bear responsibility for			0
" @entity0 's @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
