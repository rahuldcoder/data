-- " @entity6 , " a schlock ensemble love - o-rama timed for the season of easy good feeling , is a movie i often found myself laughing at in ridicule , and one that also gave me a lump in the throat			1
so i guess you could say i had a good time			0
the movie , like last year 's " @entity14 , " was written by @entity15 and directed by @entity16 , and i can just imagine @entity16 showing up on the set to basically shout seven words : '' action ! '' '' all right , everybody , overact ! '' '' okay , cut ! '' if you had to pick the cheesiest subplot , your head might explode			2
is it @entity24 as a rock star trying to win back the @entity27 © e he dumped -- a superchef played by @entity29 , who looks as if she can barely slice a pineapple ? is it @entity32 as a smirk - aleck stuck on a grimy elevator with an agonizingly sincere backup singer ( @entity35 ) ? is it @entity37 as a @entity39 exec who saves the dropping @entity6 ball from mechanical failure ? ( she calls ... @entity42 ! a repairman with funny @entity45 accent ! ) or is it @entity47 as a dying man with a bucket - list wish so wispy that the entire anecdote seems designed to let @entity47 shoot his scenes in less than an hour ? " @entity6 " is dunderheaded kitsch , but it 's the kind of marzipan movie that can sweetly soak up a holiday evening			1
