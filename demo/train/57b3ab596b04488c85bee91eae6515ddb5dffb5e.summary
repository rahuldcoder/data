@entity1 , @entity0 -- while the @entity4 is without doubt the grandest of all the awards ceremonies , it does n't have the world stage to itself			2
" @entity13 " won the @entity10 nomination -- but failed to make the @entity12 's shortlist in @entity1 , the @entity14 have their @entity15 ; @entity16 has the @entity17 ; and @entity10 celebrates the @entity18 , where " @entity23 " won six out of its " magnifique " 11 nominations			1
and it was this foreign fare that gave rise to the biggest controversy at @entity28 's big event			0
" @entity23 " amassed an impressive eleven nominations at the @entity30			2
@entity32 's astonishing transformation into @entity33 won her @entity35 gongs at the @entity36 , @entity15 and the @entity4			2
but " @entity23 " was not among the contenders for @entity38			2
another @entity10 language film , " @entity39 , " was on many critics ' top ten lists for the films of 2007			1
it won the @entity44 and its @entity46 director @entity45 was nominated for an @entity4			2
but like " @entity23 , " this film was not among the contenders for @entity38			2
a third @entity10 film , " @entity13 " won the special jury prize at @entity51 and it received an @entity4 nomination for @entity53 , but yet again , this was not a nominee for @entity38			1
@entity10 suffered through an abundance of riches this year , with three potential @entity4 winners			1
but to enter the race for best foreign film , @entity10 , like every other country , had to nominate just one			1
so " @entity23 " and " @entity65 " were rejected by the @entity10 film authorities in favor of " @entity13			1
" but " @entity13 " did n't sufficiently impress the @entity4 judges : so @entity10 had no films among the final five nominees			1
@entity10 frustration at the @entity4 process was echoed in @entity71 , which chose @entity73 's film , " @entity72 , " as its official entry			1
the film won both critical acclaim and the @entity77 at the @entity78			0
but @entity4 judges ruled there was too little @entity71 involvement -- none of the lead actors are from @entity71			1
the double oscar winning director watched in disbelief as his film was banned and @entity71 was told to pick another film instead : @entity4 caution triumphing over @entity73 's lust for a third @entity4			1
and the list goes on : the @entity92 film , " @entity91 " was excluded for having too much @entity0 -- but it 's the only way the @entity92 and @entity94 protagonists can communicate in the film and is a key part of the plot			0
but @entity92 submitted " @entity98 " instead -- and made the final five			0
" @entity102 " may have proved an international success at the box office , but it did n't fly with @entity4 watchdogs			0
set in @entity104 with @entity105 as its main language , it fell foul of the rulebook by having too little @entity104 involvement and a @entity112 - @entity46 director			0
but for most critics , the most inexplicable omission from the shortlist of nominees was @entity119 's " 4 months , 3 weeks & 2 days , " winner of the @entity121 in @entity51 and considered by many to be a sure - fire @entity4 winner			1
some feel its challenging subject of a back - street abortion in communist @entity119 was too testing for conservative members of the @entity12 's @entity127 , whose volunteers tend to include many retirees -- who else has time to attend screenings of 63 foreign language films ? even @entity133 , the chairman of the @entity12 's @entity134 , acknowledged that some of the criticism levelled against the @entity12 this year was " justifiable "			2
he told @entity2 : " we took quite a beating , and i think quite justifiably , not for the films that we selected but for the films that we did n't select			0
" and i felt very passionately about it and spoke out about it more than i should have done , but there was a part of me saying " wait a minute i did n't sign on for this -- i did n't sign on to be the scapegoat and we received a lot of criticism and yet it 's something i feel so passionately about i think foreign language film and particularly subtitled film in the @entity46 are really an endangered species			0
" @entity155 also point out that they 're only asking countries to nominate their favorite film ; they then pick the best of that bunch			0
mr @entity133 said it would be unfair to allow countries to submit more than one film as the selection process would become " unmanageable "			0
" there have been arguments that why ca n't a coutnry submit more films ? @entity10 for instance might argue we make 50 films a year , maybe five of them are @entity4 worthy and @entity173 maybe only makes one why is it we have the same group as they ? "			1
" not that i ever like to mix sports with the arts but it 's a little bit like the @entity178			0
@entity180 could probably submit five teams but they 're only allowed to submit one -- and it 's what makes it a fair race , " he explains			0
" the other thing is quite frankly this year we had 63 films			0
we could not see many more than that			0
so if we had 5 from this country and 3 from this country it would be completely unmanageable			0
" and while the one - film - per - country rule fails to reward a nation with a flourishing film industry , it does ensure diversity : no less than 63 countries from @entity200 to @entity201 submitted films for the 80th @entity4			1
@entity92 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , and @entity207 -- representing 210 million people in all -- were the countries vying for the prize on @entity4 night , and the @entity12 points to the quality of those on the list , rather those that are not , as ultimate proof that the system works			1

@entity12 rules mean each country can only submit one film
@entity10 dismissed " @entity23 " and " @entity39 "
its choice , " @entity13 , " failed to make the @entity4 shortlist
@entity71 's choice , @entity73 's " @entity228 , " was also *blocked* by the @entity12
