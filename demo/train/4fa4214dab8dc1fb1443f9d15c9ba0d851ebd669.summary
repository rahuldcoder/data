-- @entity2 's latest movie may be just the " edge " the actor needs			1
since 2011 's " @entity5 : ghost protocol " -- his last feature to cross the $ 100 million mark at the domestic box office -- the 51 - year - old has had a spotty track record			1
the 2012 comedy " @entity16 " and the 2013 sci - fi drama " @entity15 " were both mildly received by audiences and film critics , while his 2012 outing as @entity20 's imposing @entity19 did n't fare much better			1
but with friday 's " @entity23 , " critics are placing their bets on @entity2			2
directed by @entity26 , " @entity25 as a military pr rep who finds himself thrown into a battle against an alien invasion			0
@entity2 's character swiftly dies , only to find himself in a sort of time loop that causes him to come back to life			1
yet every time @entity2 's maj. @entity35 returns to the land of the living , he is acquiring more skills to help him stay alive and potentially reach victory			1
the person helping him navigate the war zone is @entity42 's warrior - like soldier @entity43			2
the plot might sound convoluted -- it 's based on the @entity46 novel " @entity47 , " and has elicited more than one comparison to " @entity49 " -- but the movie has received largely positive reviews			1
" just when you were ready to give up on the summer season and its cookie - cutter , been - there blockbusters , ' @entity23 ' saves the day , " raves the @entity52			0
" it 's a star - driven mass - market entertainment that 's smart , exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions			0
" part of the movie 's fresh appeal is its casting of @entity2 as the guy who does n't want to dive right into the action			1
as the @entity70 ' @entity69 points out , we 've become used to seeing @entity2 walk on screen fully equipped as the grim action hero , and his " @entity23 " role is essentially the antithesis of that			0
" ( @entity76 ) atching him glide through the opening of ' @entity23 ' ... it 's hard not to think , ' where has this guy been ? ' " @entity69 writes			0
" it 's been years since mr. @entity2 felt this light on screen			2
" blunt as his co-star is no slouch , either			0
@entity86 calls her @entity2 's " action - hero equal , " making " @entity23 " " better for it " -- and , as a whole , @entity88 's @entity87 was impressed			1
" a furiously time - looping joy ride , ( it 's ) the smartest action film of the early summer season , " @entity87 says in his review			0
" the movie 's only static element is its title , which oddly suggests a mashup of tv soap operas			0
" ( well , unless you count the tedium that can set in from watching @entity2 " live , die and repeat " over and over again , as @entity104 's @entity103 warns			2
) but , as any studio head can tell you , good buzz is just half the battle in building a summer blockbuster			0
and with heady competition from " @entity113 , " @entity111 's @entity110 is predicting the teen romance will hold back " @entity23 " at the box office			1
if @entity2 does n't re-emerge as box office king , he can at least rest easy knowing he 's won over several critics once again			1
" ( g ) ive @entity2 credit , " says @entity119 's @entity118			2
" not only is he hard - headed enough to get right back on the horse that bucked him , but he manages to show us why he still matters as a movie star			0

@entity2 's new sci - fi movie is in theaters
it 's been met with largely positive reviews
but it may not hold up well against box office competition
