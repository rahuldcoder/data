it was almost 5 p.m. on a tuesday , and 18 - year - old @entity1 was doing her homework , researching @entity3 at a @entity5 cybercafe			2
meanwhile , @entity6 , 29 , had returned home from a day at @entity8 -- where she studied information technology -- and was chatting with a friend			1
that 's when everything started to shake			1
while @entity15 was able to run out , unscarred , she lost her uncle and her house was destroyed			2
@entity18 was injured when falling debris struck and broke her hip			2
luckily , everyone else in her family survived unhurt			2
it 's been five years since a january afternoon in @entity25 was interrupted by a devastating earthquake that instantly changed millions of lives and everyone still remembers the day vividly			1
it is estimated that the earthquake took the lives of more than 230,000 people			2
five years after the quake : @entity25 at a crossroads but since 2012 , these two women -- along with 20 others -- have also shared a different experience			1
in the outskirts of @entity39 , @entity40 , a town where sports usually means @entity43 football , 22 @entity25 and @entity25 - @entity37 women live in two small apartments and work hard to achieve one big dream : they strive to win soccer glory wearing the colors of the @entity48 under the guide of @entity51 - born coach @entity50			1
to open their doors is to enter another world where @entity55 mixes with @entity56 and @entity57 in the hallway of an apartment kept at tropical warmth			2
fragrant rice , beans and bananes cook on the stove top			2
socks , shorts and jerseys are in the washing machine ; bright cleats are strewn in room corners			2
they come from @entity5 , the capital , as well as @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
some played with local teams , with unclear prospects for a future in the sport			1
their stories are those of struggle and of love for a game they played despite mothers ' warnings , admonitions or disapproval			2
@entity18 , now 33 , is the only one of her 16 siblings who plays the sport			2
" my mother , she did n't accept me playing soccer , she thought that soccer is only for men , but i like soccer since i was young			1
i always liked to play , even though she beat me , even though i had to hide to play , " she recalls			2
@entity18 , the team captain until this season , was one of the first players recruited by @entity50			0
while living in @entity5 , she played with the @entity102 and was told about the team that the coach was assembling			0
she did n't think twice about making the leap			0
" i was really happy because my objective for a long time was to play in another country , " she says			0
charities continue to help in @entity25 's recovery what was the hardest thing about coming to the @entity37 ? the cold , she says , as she digs deeper into the pockets of a blue sports jacket with the seal of the @entity118			1
for the players , being part of the team also means sacrifices			0
none of them gets paid or gets perks			0
@entity15 -- or @entity126 as she 's affectionately known -- lost her father last year in the midst of the @entity130 qualifier matches season			1
the @entity132 offered to cover a one - way ticket to @entity25 with a much later return flight			0
she decided to stay and play with the team			0
" soccer helps me forget the pain			1
i do n't think of anything , " says soft - spoken @entity15 , who is now 22 and also serves as the team translator			0
her first soccer memory was a gift from her father			1
" i was 7 or 8 years old when i got my first cleats , from my father			1
i always played with the other kids but barefoot			0
one day he decided to buy me new cleats , " she recalls			0
" my father always talked to me about soccer because he loved the game , and he wanted me to play soccer and become a great football ( player )			1
" the team has brought together players from all backgrounds , sharing @entity25 roots and soccer dreams			1
@entity158 lives in @entity159 , where she played for the @entity160 before the team folded			0
she came to play for @entity50 after hearing he needed players			0
with perfect @entity56 and " so - so " @entity55 , she says her grandparents came from @entity25			0
@entity164 also lives and trains in @entity159 , where she met fellow teammate @entity166 , a blond , green - eyed player of @entity25 descent			0
they quickly reported to @entity50 to join the team when it all began in 2012			0
@entity171 janitor brings clean water to hometown in @entity25 " it 's our shot at glory , " @entity166 says with a broad smile			1
@entity164 proudly shows a video of the sub- 11 girls team she coaches back home in @entity181			0
for @entity164 -- for them all -- it 's all about building a future for women in the sport			1
" i think it 's really important for females like us to be coaches			1
my club right now is supporting me through this entire thing because they realize that young females do n't have enough female professional soccer players that are tangible to them , and so i think it 's really a big responsibility for us to turn around and give back to the youth , " she says			1
at the helm of this squad is @entity50 , an established soccer coach who took @entity202 , in the women 's @entity203 , to two consecutive championships in 2007 and 2008 and @entity206 club @entity205 to a @entity208 title in the 2009 - 2010 season			1
@entity50 was offered the coaching position , and after watching @entity25 play in the @entity211 , he decided to take on the challenge and aimed to help the team become the first @entity215 nation to play at the @entity216			0
@entity50 met with @entity132 president @entity217			0
" president @entity218 was very upfront with me ; he shared the challenges that the federation faced so i just knew from day one			1
" with limited funds from the @entity132 -- just enough to cover the travel between @entity25 and the @entity37 -- @entity50 brought the team to the @entity39 , @entity40			1
" the soccer culture in @entity25 is such where if a boy plays soccer , there 's clear opportunities for that boy to turn professional			1
so the family understands that , and they will allow the boy to play and practice			0
" with girls , there [ are ] simply no opportunities available , so it 's not being taken serious , " says @entity50			1
" for families , it 's difficult to understand why a girl should be practicing twice a day because there is no end game , " he adds			1
" the only way to take a step forward was to bring them to a controlled environment			0
it was critical for us to get them out of @entity25 and bring them to the @entity37 , " he says			1
in @entity39 , @entity50 incorporated part of the squad to the @entity202 team and uses the college soccer season as preparation for the team and practice for tournaments			1
he also established a nonprofit organization -- @entity262 for @entity263 -- to raise funds for the team			0
they regularly do soccer camps and fundraising events to cover their costs			1
" we 're typically three months behind on rent payments because the money we bring in comes in the summer months , " says @entity50			0
" this is pretty stressful for players			0
" everything from their uniforms and cleats to the gear and the coaching staff 's time is donated			2
" all of our positions are voluntary , in that we do not receive any type of salary " says @entity282 , the team 's assistant coach and a former soccer player			1
the squad aimed to change their fate by qualifying for the @entity216 in @entity291			0
the qualifying tournament held over the summer across the @entity215 and several @entity37 cities helped them gain notoriety , particularly after the cash - strapped team came to aid its counterparts from @entity297 , coached by @entity298			1
" his team arrived in @entity301 with 500 dollars and no transportation from the airport			0
@entity298 is a former coach for the @entity304 ; he 's helped us in terms of development and so when this happened to his team , it was just a natural reaction that we have to help as well , " @entity50 said			2
their gesture went viral in the @entity312 , many pledged support to the @entity25 team			0
among them , @entity316 shoes donated sports gear , and the @entity318 reached out to inquire about the team 's needs			2
@entity50 says substantive aid still needs to materialize			0
but after a very exciting season of matches against @entity215 countries and bigger teams such as @entity37 , @entity326 and @entity327 , @entity25 was unable to win the three matches needed to secure a spot to the @entity130			1
for @entity50 , it 's back to the drawing board			2
" we are at a crossroad , " he says			0
" we do n't know how we 're going to approach preparation this year			0
" for some players , this was the end of the road			0
captain @entity6 and other players return to @entity25 , to go on with the lives they paused in the name of the sport			1
roughly half of the players that came from @entity25 will remain in the team and a new crop will join the national squad as well as the @entity350 and u- 20 teams , all coached by @entity50			1
qualifying matches for the two spots available to the @entity354 , @entity355 and @entity356 for the @entity357 starts this coming fall			0
the players ' dreams live on .			0

the worlds of @entity362 and @entity6 *imploded* five years *ago*
along with 20 other women , they came to the @entity37 to seek soccer glory
between *financial* woes and the challenges women 's teams face , it 's been a hard journey
