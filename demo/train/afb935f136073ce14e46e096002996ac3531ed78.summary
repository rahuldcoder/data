-- @entity2 manager @entity1 has called on his team to continue their rejuvenated bid to win the @entity6 title in the wake of the horrific broken leg suffered by young midfielder @entity9			1
the 19 - year - old @entity11 international has been ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining fractures to the tibia and fibula in his right leg in saturday 's 3 - 1 victory against @entity19			1
the injury , caused by a challenge from @entity19 's new @entity23 squad member @entity22 , brought back memories of the horror break suffered by @entity2 teammate @entity26 against @entity27 two years ago			1
@entity9 is seen as a star of the future , having impressed after making 29 appearances in his second season with the club			1
the @entity33 battled back from 1 - 0 down at @entity19 to move to within three points of leaders @entity36 , who had two players sent off in a 4 - 2 defeat at home to @entity40 on saturday			1
@entity1 believes his team can still win the title despite recent defeats to @entity36 and second - placed @entity43			1
" it will be tight until the end , " the @entity44 told the club 's official web site			2
" but this group is so strong mentally and have a unity , so this will give us one more reason to fight until the end and do it for him			2
" we had some other problems two years ago			0
but on saturday we had a midfield of @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity9 , @entity60 , @entity61			1
they have an average of 20 or 21 years old			0
up front , @entity64 is 21 years old			0
" at their age , to handle the game like they did is absolutely remarkable			0
" @entity1 's dedication to " the beautiful game " has often seen his team criticized for being " soft " but he said that he often tells his players off for not committing to tackles			1
" i encourage my players to play and be committed , " he said			0
" i have a go at them when they do n't put their foot in sometimes			0
" but as well , sometimes i nearly feel guilty to do that because when @entity9 goes for the ball like he did on saturday and gets done like he did , it is not an easy situation			2
" but the way i try to play the game , i believe , is the right way			0
when we do n't win i get a lot of stick because of that way , but i still prefer to continue to play like that			2
" we will respect the game , the opponents and try to give pleasure to people who watch us			0
