-- the sweet aroma of blossoming orange trees wafts through the air as a white - haired figure moves slowly along the green - choked path			1
aided by a yard stick , 85 - year - old @entity6 walks through his citrus orchard in @entity11 's @entity10 area , occasionally stopping to check the lush fruits hanging from the trees			1
the scene strikes a sharp contrast to what the veteran agriculturalist encountered when he returned to the area in early 2000 to retire following a successful career as a @entity11 diplomat and leading banker			2
weeds and bushes had reclaimed the deserted plots as much of the land laid fallow and under - utilized due to lack of resources and the local farmers ' economic hardship			2
" i decided that something had to be done and with my agricultural background , i thought i could perhaps initiate something that could help the people , " says @entity6			0
as a result , the farming pioneer , whose first business was a plant nursery in 1963 , embarked on a mission to show small plot owners how to lift themselves out of poverty by growing orange trees on a commercial scale			2

so far , the project has helped to set up some 100 small farms			0
" he helped us a lot , we did n't know anything about oranges , " says @entity59 , a smallholder who today earns a steady income by selling the oranges from her 800 trees to major retail chains across @entity11			1
" there 's enough income , i can manage to pay my helpers , we even eat there and buy fertilizers with that money , " she adds			0
commercial farming is a major industry in @entity11 -- it distributes produce all over the world while @entity79 's fruit market sells about a million tons of goods every year			2
but the picture is quite different in other parts of the continent -- more than two - thirds of @entity11 countries are net importers of agricultural products , with the continent importing $ 50 billion worth of food every year , according to @entity91 figures			1
see also : @entity11 can feed itself in a generation @entity93 , regional economist for the eastern and southern @entity11 division at the @entity95 says these mass imports represent a " huge missed opportunity for @entity11 producers			2
" " this is related to very poor yields in a lot of @entity11 countries that make it a requirement for countries to go out of their borders and go outside of the continent to meet food requirements for their people , " he says			1
they are views echoed by @entity117 chairman @entity116 who wrote in his 2012 letter , " given the central role that food plays in human welfare and national stability , it is shocking - not to mention short - sighted and potentially dangerous - how little money is spent on agricultural research			1
" on the whole , only 3.5 % of @entity11 's arable land is irrigated and about 9 % of world fertilizer is used in the continent , according to the @entity91 @entity93 says the low levels of @entity11 productivity are linked to a lack of investment in agriculture by @entity11 governments and donor organizations over the last two decades			1
he notes , however , that a change is taking place now			0
" in the last three or four years there 's been a renaissance of interest by those @entity11 governments and donors regarding the critical role agriculture plays in economic development , " he says			1
" we are seeing that @entity11 governments are now spending more for basic research , for applied research , extension services and we feel there will be a pay - off in the medium - term for this increased investment			1

" thirty - four per cent of @entity160 live more than five hours away from a market town of 5,000 people , " he says			0
" increasing market access to particularly improve field roads and improve access to electricity for processing is absolutely fundamental to improving agricultural productivity and increasing economic growth in these countries			0
" back in the @entity10 fields , @entity6 also calls on @entity11 leaders to take a greater role in encouraging people to work on the land			0
" the government has to do a great deal to rekindle the enthusiasm which once existed in agriculture , " @entity6 , who ran the first black - owned bank in @entity182 , says			0
passionate about farming , @entity6 believes it 's smallholdings that have the potential to revitalize communities and help curb @entity11 's soaring levels of unemployment			0
" if we do not create sufficient employment opportunities in our country we will certainly end up in a very terrible situation , " he says			0
" we must skill the black people to use that land in a way that can enable them to become job creators as well as contributors to the development of the country			0
