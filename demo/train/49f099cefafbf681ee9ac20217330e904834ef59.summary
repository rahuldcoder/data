there 's something strange about seeing @entity2 get deep and thoughtful			1
it 's like sitting through one of those plays where prisoners perform @entity7 -- it 's just unexpected			0
likewise , the side of @entity2 on show in his new art exhibit at @entity12 in @entity13 , is far from the pages of people			1
dealing with themes like triumph , failure and chaos , @entity2 reveals himself as a man who 's more than just a gruff , muscled hero out to beat the odds , but someone who 's emotional and even intellectual			2
@entity2 is just starting to unleash his paintings on the world			1
his first exhibition was in @entity27 in 2011			0
apparently , @entity2 's been painting for nearly 50 years -- even before he started acting			2
the exhibition -- which includes three dozen paintings -- describes painting as his first love			2
but , an introduction reads , " due to financial problems , he had to become an actor			0
" because that 's the first thing you do if you 're poor : act			0
@entity39 's 10 ritziest hotels ' @entity40 ' @entity2 's work is influenced by abstract expressionism			1
it 's as if emotion is thrown onto the canvasses in red ( @entity2 's favorite color , according to the museum ) , black and yellow			2
each painting lives in its own world , like " @entity40 , " 2010 , where @entity2 paints the downfall of @entity53 , who 's life is collapsing around him as he 's dressed in his iconic 1990s military jacket , with strands of black hair draped over his face			2
beyond the recurrent self - portraits of himself as his legendary " @entity63 " character bleeding in a boxing ring , there are also more whimsical paintings , including one in which @entity2 scrawled phrases like " @entity68 , @entity69 , " " the arts endure you " and " whores			1
" celebrity status when it comes to modern art , @entity2 is no @entity76 -- though the exhibit does feature photos @entity76 took of his friend @entity2			2
many of the visitors crowding into the museum 's narrow halls say they never knew @entity2 painted			0
they come because they 're fans of his movies , like 20 - year - old @entity85 , visiting from @entity86			0
" he 's very popular			0
so many people have seen his films in @entity39			0
" but that 's about as far as @entity2 's talent goes , he says			0
" it 's not good			0
but there are some interesting elements			0
" @entity13 : best sights in city of tsars others have a more imaginative view of @entity2 the painter			1
" i think it 's a new system for @entity2 to explain his creativity , " says @entity101 tourist @entity100			0
@entity39 communists do n't like his art though			1
they unsuccessfully protested the opening of the exhibition because of @entity2 's role in " @entity110 , " in which he goes on a communist - killing crusade			1
expect the unexpected even if you do n't enjoy @entity2 's work , on - or off - screen , it may be worth the visit if only to see the @entity117 in a different light			1
