@entity0 -- the @entity4 government 's press division is apologizing for circulating a link to a video that mocks activists aboard a ship headed to @entity9 earlier this week that was blocked by an @entity4 raid			1
" due to a misunderstanding on our part , earlier ( friday ) we inadvertently issued a video link that had been sent for our perusal , " according to a statement from @entity4 's @entity17 , which distributed the link to media outlets			1
" it was not intended for general release , " the statement said			0
" the contents of the video in no way represent the official policy of either the @entity17 or of the @entity4			1
" the video , titled " @entity28 " -- set to the tune of the 1985 hit , " @entity29 " -- was put together by @entity30 , a former member of the @entity31 and columnist for the @entity33			1
in the video , up to a dozen members of the so - called " @entity28 " -- some wearing a variation of traditional @entity37 dress -- sing satirical verses , such as : " there 's no people dying , so the best that we can do is create the biggest bluff of all			1
" on her blog , @entity30 , who briefly appears in the video , says , " we produced a clip in @entity49			2
there we feature the @entity54 - @entity53 ' love boat ' captain , crew and passengers in a musical explanation of how they con the world			0
" " we think this is an important @entity4 contribution to the discussion of recent events and we hope you distribute it far and wide , " she adds			2
nine @entity54 citizens were killed monday after violence erupted on one of six ships in a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid to the @entity70 @entity9			2
a number of other people were wounded			0
@entity4 said the passengers initiated the attack ; the passengers blamed the troops			2
that incident drew widespread condemnation and cast a spotlight on the dynamics of the @entity9 crisis			0
on saturday , @entity4 intercepted the final boat that was part of the flotilla , though the incident aboard the @entity86 - owned @entity85 ended peacefully about 22 miles off the @entity9 coast			1
@entity4 government spokesman @entity88 dismissed the the video link , saying , " the @entity17 sends out lots of articles			1
it does n't mean they like it			0
" @entity88 said he first noticed the video on the @entity97 website			0
" i called my kids in to watch it because i thought it was funny , " he said			0
" it is what @entity4 feel			1
but the government has nothing to do with it			0
the @entity17 distributes non-government items , things that we think that show our side of the story			0
" it was not the first time the @entity4 @entity17 stirred controversy with its public communications on the @entity9 flotilla			1
prior to the storming of the @entity54 ship , the @entity17 sent an e-mail to journalists sarcastically recommending that while covering " alleged humanitarian difficulties , " journalists should dine at one of @entity9 's few restaurants			1
" we have been told the beef stroganoff and cream of spinach soup are highly recommended , " the e-mail said			0
the message included an internet link to an old promotional video for the restaurant			0
the e-mail drew criticism from the foreign press and pro-palestinian activists			1
