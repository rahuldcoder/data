last time i was in @entity2 i burned down an apartment			1
it was n't arson ; it was the faulty wiring on a trash - picked lamp			1
or , from the look of the hard black puddle that used to be my stereo , a bad wall outlet			1
i never found out because two days later i left town to wait tables at @entity13			2
as the @entity14 turned into a knitting needle in the rearview mirror of the bus i was riding , i wrote bad poetry and fractured thoughts into my soot - stained journal , including this : " @entity2 is too nice			1
better to live here when i 'm older and have a family			2
i hope @entity24 is able to get my deposit back			2
" that was 19 years ago			1
i still do n't have a family			2
@entity2 has only gotten nicer			1
and i 'm happy to report that @entity24 , my former apartment manager , was able to get my deposit back			1
visiting @entity2 again , recently , i felt traces of what i was getting at with the " too nice " thing			1
coming from most places in the @entity33 , the city can feel a bit like visiting a friend 's upper middle class parents ' house while they are away for the weekend			1
it 's wealthy , its yard is beautiful ( verdant , bracketed by two mountain ranges ) , it has nice amenities and the fridge is stocked			1
i think my trash - picking bohemian 18 - year - old self was looking for something more edgy and glamorous			1
* here 's what " too nice " * * can mean to a visitor			1
you wake up on saturday morning and after securing breakfast at @entity51 -- where one can grab coffee , crumpets , full breakfasts with a view , the best scrambled eggs ever or whatever morning vittles you require -- you then have to decide what to do next			2
a visit to the @entity61 on the edge of downtown ? a stroll through trendy @entity66 's boutique shops , cafes and restaurants ? a ride up the @entity14 or a climb up the brick water tower in @entity72 ? sail @entity73 ? or trek to one of the city 's vital outer neighborhoods like @entity78 , the self - proclaimed @entity79 , or @entity80 , a @entity82 fishing village turned hipster retail district ? that 's a lot			1
too nice ? probably not			1
here 's what i did : all of the above			2
after breakfast i started at the @entity88 , * * * a zig - zag of 20 outdoor sculptures made by the art world all - stars ( @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 )			1
it feels kind of like a highbrow miniature golf course			2
there are mini-ecosystems created to reflect @entity101 's biodiversity			2
a mini-aspen grove , a sloping meadow of grass and wildflowers			2
there are bright red movable chairs where you can rest and a pedestrian bridge over functioning train tracks			2
and there 's a water hazard : glorious @entity113 itself			2
the garden spills onto beach littered with driftwood and an arsenal of skipping stones			2
you do n't have to admire the water from the beach			2
there are scads of boat tours for visitors			2
but what you should really do is head to the @entity127 on the south shore of @entity73			2
imagine a car museum that lets you rent the cars			2
that 's how @entity127 works			2
it 's also a living workspace filled with volunteers building , repairing and maintaining boats			0
as you stroll the floating dock and talk with the people there you begin to learn another language			0
" @entity141 " is the forward-most vertical edge of a sail			0
a " sloop " is a single fore - and - aft rigged mast and bowsprit			1
a " fishing smack " is a boat for fishing			0
i went on one of @entity127 free sunday sails ( they leave at 1:00 and 2:30 , but sign - up begins at 10 a.m. , so get there early			1
) and met a couple from @entity155 celebrating their 40th anniversary			0
we blew by gaudy power yachts moored to the coast and imagined we were pirates			0
the sky overhead looked like a pile of oyster shells			0
there is probably a word for the feeling of being surrounded by water that 's surrounded by a city			1
i do n't know it			0
all i know is that i was sad when we had to dock the boat			0
but i got over it			0
i went to visit the spot of my old apartment in @entity66			0
like many city hills , the top of @entity66 is wealthy and older and the neighborhood gets poorer and younger as you move down toward @entity179 which separates it from @entity181			1
of course , i used to live at the bottom			0
the year i left , a new coffee shop opened called @entity184			0
it 's now an institution			0
and the area around it is now all a-bustle			0
a block away is @entity190 , a hipster - foodie @entity192 complete with record store , wine bar and sustainable sandwich shop			1
it was also home to the best meal i had in a city filled with best meals			1
@entity200 & @entity201 embodies the gourmet , local in a casual setting that defines much of the city 's food culture			1
as you climb the hill on @entity208 you begin to see restaurant after shop after bar			0
the area rivals any other urban trend center in the @entity33			0
if you can make it through the gantlet of cocktails and kombucha , you 'll be rewarded by the many treasures of verdant @entity72			1
yes , the @entity14 downtown is worth a ride , but the old brick water tower in @entity72 gives you something the @entity14 ca n't : a view of the @entity14			0
the park also boasts the @entity225 and a conservatory teeming with flowers			0
but my favorite spot is @entity231 's grave , just north of the park in @entity233			0
you can find it by looking for the goth kids milling about @entity231 's son @entity238 's grave			0
he 's buried next to his father			0
the grave site reminds you of all the cultural figures that at one point called the @entity2 home : @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 , and , yeah , @entity250			1
on my last day , i boarded a bus ( there is a nifty free smartphone app for @entity2 called @entity254 that pinpoints your location and tells you where the closest bus is and where it will take you ) and went to @entity80 , a little @entity82 fishing village that reluctantly became part of @entity2 in 1907			1
it has an all - day market on sundays			1
there are more cute boutiques and restaurants than you can shake an umbrella at			0
but the best part is the @entity269 , where you can watch as boats are safely transitioned to the different water levels as they move from salt water to fresh water			0
below the lock is a fish ladder where you can watch the area 's famous salmon swim upstream on biological autopilot to mate and hatch their eggs			0
watch them through huge glass windows as they make			1
it might be too nice for a restless @entity287 18 - year - old under the influence of @entity289 , but even the salmon know it 's a good place to return and raise a family			1
footnotes * of course @entity2 did have an edge to it in the early ' 90s			1
heroin addiction was rampant ( the curse of being a @entity297 port town at the time )			0
the closest i came to the city 's drug trade was when i accompanied my co-worker from @entity303 , an @entity305 specialty food store in @entity51 , while he bought marijuana from his old friend who " had n't not had weed since the late ' 70s			1
" ( there was apparently a " weed drought " that summer			0
) i was unaware of who we were visiting until i innocently asked our host about the huge new guitar amplifier in his living room			0
" oh that ? they sent it to me for free when they found out we were opening for @entity324 , " he said while staring at the 6 o'clock news on tv			0
" i was like ' whatever i 'm not going to be opening for @entity324 my whole life			0
' " " what 's the name of your band ? " i asked			0
" * * now let 's not get carried away , @entity2 is a modern city with all the attendant problems that entails			1
there is poverty ( some say the phrase " skid row " was invented here ) and in particular a high concentration of " gutter punks			0
" that is , kids with hoodies , tattoos , dogs and suspiciously good orthodontia who ask for money with a sneer			0
but even the poverty situation here feels less hopeless than other places			0
@entity352 , a homeless guy i split a hot dog with my first night there , told me , " they take care of their homeless people here			0
" * * * let the fact that this city recently unveiled an $ 85 million outdoor sculpture garden tell you everything you need to know about the weather			1
but , as every @entity2 booster will quickly tell you , not as much per year as @entity368 or even @entity369 , and the weather is always temperate			1
ah , yes , but what about the number of grey days ? well , it 's not a coincidence that @entity2 invented @entity33 's modern coffee addiction and its biggest online ( i.e. do n't have to go outside ) retailer			1
but , truly , would you visit @entity379 when the sun was n't out ? or @entity368 when it 's empty ? the weather is part of @entity2 's identity , and i encourage people to visit during the long grey season			1
bonus : there are travel deals to be had .			0

a long - ago @entity2 *resident* returns to the city he *deemed* " too nice " at 18
his findings ? a lot to make a *thirtysomething* happy
outdoor *attractions* , unique neighborhoods and great food are draws
