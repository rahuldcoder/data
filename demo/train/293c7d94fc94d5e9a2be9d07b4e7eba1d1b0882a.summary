-- @entity1 is 79 years old			1
she 's a grandmother to five , great - grandmother to two			2
she 's also a pole - vaulting , hurdle - jumping track and field star			1
in 2011 , she set the world indoor record in the pole vault for women over the age of 75			1
she set the world record for the 60 - meter hurdles and the 4x100 meter relay that same year			1
she has also set records in the steeplechase , the discus , the 200 - meter hurdles and the hammer throw			1
in total , @entity1 holds 15 world records and 12 @entity20 records -- not bad for a woman who picked up pole vaulting at 65			1
@entity1 , of @entity23 , @entity24 , and more than 10,000 other seniors are taking their athletic prowess to @entity27 this weekend for the 2013 @entity28			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity1 about her love of the long jump , her favorite world record and why other people thinks she 's , well , " a little nuts			1
" the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : have you been active your whole life , or is this a new development ? @entity1 : oh , i think i 've been pretty active , but more active since i took up track and field at age 60			1
believe it or not , i 'm more active now			2
@entity0 : how did you get into the sport so late ? @entity1 : i was playing tennis -- singles , doubles and mixed doubles with my husband -- for the senior olympics , and my training partner now , @entity54 , came over and said , " we need people in track and field desperately , and i think you would be good at it			1
" and i said , " well , do n't look at me , i 've never done track in my life			1
" she said , " when you 're done your tennis , come over and try the long jump			1
" so that 's what i did ... and i fell in love with it immediately			2
the year afterwards , i competed for the first time in track and field , and i did the long jump			1
i came in fourth out of 25 women			2
and in the high jump , i tied for third			2
do n't you think that did n't motivate me ? ( laughs ) for being a track and field person for the first time ? so that got me going			1
and my training partner is a real go - getter and very hard worker			2
we both have broken all kinds of @entity20 and world records			1
we challenge each other -- but if one wins , gets a better score , it 's fine			2
we 're always in agreement , and we 're always good friends			1
@entity0 : what is it about track and field that you like ? @entity1 : track and field is very challenging			1
my training partner , she excels more in the 100 and 200 sprints and stuff			2
i like the pole ( vault ) and the hurdles -- they 're more challenging for me			1
@entity0 : what do you like about pole vaulting ? @entity1 : people think i 'm a little nuts , i think ( laughs )			1
i was 65 when i first took it up			1
i was at a senior meet , and i saw some ladies doing it , and it did n't look like they were going very high			2
i always like challenges , and i said , " boy , this looks like a real good challenge for me			2
" that 's why i took it up			2
it 's the most difficult sport , and it 's also the most challenging			1
it 's the most rewarding , i think			2
believe it or not , in the ( women 's ) 75 - and - over ( group ) i have the world record			1
i have that under my belt , and that is a fantastic feeling			2
the height was 6 ' 3 " and a quarter , but i 've done 6 ' 8 " before			2
@entity0 : that must take a lot of upper - body strength			2
@entity1 : it 's mostly upper core			1
you have to have a strong upper core and very strong arms , because all the strength is in your arms and the upper part of your body			2
@entity0 : what 's your training schedule like ? @entity1 : on mondays , wednesdays and fridays , i do a lot of track			1
some days , we will do 25 - meter sprints ; then we will increase to 50 meters			0
then , we 'll go up to 100 meters several times			0
then we might do a few 200 - meter runs			0
we change our training day - to - day			0
on wednesday , we might practice our hurdles			1
@entity148 does n't do a lot of the throwing events , and i do , so on some other days , i 'll do the shot put			0
like this morning , i did my javelin few times , and then i did my hammer			0
and i only took up hammer maybe four years ago , but i really enjoy it			1
and then my discus -- i really enjoy discus , too			0
on tuesdays and thursdays , i 'll do weights with the machines			0
and i play tennis also			0
and do some pushups at home -- they 're the women 's pushups , not the men 's pushups			2
it takes a lot of training			0
you have to be very , very devoted			0
@entity0 : what 's the hardest part about keeping up with it ? @entity1 : in the wintertime , when it 's about 10 degrees outside , and you 're underneath the covers , and you say , " oh , i 'd love to sleep in for another couple hours			1
" but i know that my training partner is waiting ... and i ca n't not go			0
i have to be there			0
we 're very fortunate that we can train together			2
i always recommend that if someone wants to take up new sport or any other activity , they should do it with a friend , because it is so much more enjoyable because you help each other			0
@entity0 : are there any events you do n't particularly like ? @entity1 : i 'm not too keen on doing the 100 - and 200 - meter runs ... but i do them all ! sometimes , i do the pentathlon , and that 's ( five ) events			1
you have to do that in two days			0
@entity54 and i and two other girls from the @entity20 at the 2012 world meet in @entity203 , we set a world record in the 4x100 relay , so that was quite an accomplishment			1
@entity0 : you have so many			0
what 's your favorite record ? @entity1 : i really enjoyed getting the world record in the 60 - meter hurdles in @entity210 , @entity211			1
it was an indoor meet			0
i barely beat my training partner ( laughs )			0
we were neck and neck			0
@entity0 : what is your diet like ? what do you eat to stay healthy and active ? @entity1 : i take a healthy nutrition shake every morning			1
it 's made with orange juice , and it 's got all good nutrients in it			0
and then i just eat a regular lunch and dinner			0
i eat almost anything , and i do cheat once in a while			0
i do like those @entity232 fries once in a while ( laughs )			0
i have a downfall for chocolate - covered almonds			0
when i gain 2Â½ pounds , and i can tell on me right away , and i do n't feel comfortable			0
@entity0 : what advice would you give to other seniors out there who might want to try something new ? @entity1 : i keep telling them that it 's never too late			1
if i can take up track and field at 60 , anybody can take up another sport at age 50 and up			1
i recommend anyone who really looks at wanting to be healthy , they have to get going , get off the couch			0
one of the recommendations i have been mentioning is go to their senior center			0
my friends go for yoga , and there are a lot of other things they offer			0
if they really want to improve or do something more athletic , the center will have the resources to help them find what they should do and how safe it can be			0
@entity0 : speaking of safety , have you ever been injured on the field ? @entity1 : oh , i 've had a few injuries			1
i 've had a few hamstring pulls			0
but with a couple visits to the physical therapist , i heal very quickly			0
i think it 's because i 'm in such good physical condition			0
the more severe one i got was splitting my knee open on the barrier when i was doing the steeplechase			0
i got maybe a dozen stitches there			0
but i healed up within a couple weeks , and i was right back doing the same thing			0
you 're a little hesitant , though , after you get 12 stitches			1
you say , " uh oh , you better be careful			0

@entity1 , 79 , holds 15 world records and 12 @entity20 records in track and field
@entity1 loves the pole vault and the hurdles because they 're the most challenging
