-- organizers for the controversial @entity3 @entity2 have been given a boost after several @entity6 teams , including world champions @entity7 , told @entity0 they will not unilaterally pull out of the race			1
following reports this week that some teams were planning on canceling their appearance at the grand prix , which is due to take place april 22 at the @entity14 on the @entity16 island , @entity0 contacted all 12 constructors			1
nine declined to comment but @entity7 , whose driver @entity18 won the drivers ' championship and who also clinched the 2011 constructors ' title , told @entity0 that the decision on whether the @entity26 goes ahead is a matter for motorsport 's governing body the @entity31 [ @entity31 ] and not individual teams			1
teams wo n't pull out " it 's up to the @entity31 , " a @entity7 spokesperson said			1
" we take part in the @entity38 championship and if that calendar includes a race in @entity3 then we will be racing in @entity3			1
it 's not up to the teams to pick and choose which races we take part in			1
" the @entity31 are the ones monitoring the situation			1
they are the ones who make a decision based on what is happening on the ground and we take their guidance			2
" @entity52 , the driving force behind @entity6 , had earlier stated that it is up to the individual teams to decide whether they would race in @entity3			2
" we 've no way we can force people to go there , " he told the @entity58 @entity57			0
" we ca n't say ' you 've got to go ' -- although they would be in breach of their agreement with us if they did n't go -- but it does n't help			2
commercially they have to go , but whether they decide to or not is up to them			0
i 've had no one say anything other than ' we 're going to be racing in @entity3 '			0
" by not racing in @entity3 , any @entity6 team would be breaking the @entity76 -- a commercial contract between @entity31 , @entity52 's @entity78 and the teams -- and would be liable to potentially ruinous multi-million - dollar censure			1
" teams are unable to cancel grands prix , " replied the @entity81 ( @entity81 )			2
" we race in an international series called the @entity31 formula one world championship , and it is therefore for the @entity31 to offer the teams guidance on these issues			1
" a year of protests controversy has raged over the @entity26 ever since an uprising against the ruling @entity94 royal family rocked the kingdom just over a year ago			1
pro-democracy protests were crushed , with dozens killed in the ensuing violence			0
last year 's race was canceled as a result but protests have continued in the run up to this year 's race			0
local human rights groups claim that abuses have continued despite government assurances to the contrary			0
" if @entity6 go ahead with the race it will give the impression that everything is back to normal when everything is not back to normal			0
people are dying on a daily basis , " @entity112 , head of the @entity113 , told @entity0			1
" i say think of the human rights , think of things other than just your profit and your interest			0
human rights have to come first , " he added			0
" we will welcome you back when everything is back to normal , when the killing and arrests have stopped in the streets			0
" however , @entity128 , chairman of the @entity14 ( @entity129 ) where the @entity38 race will be staged , insisted that safety would not be a problem and blamed the crisis on press " scaremongering			1
" " what has been happening is that armchair observers -- who have not been sufficiently interested or committed to investigate the situation for themselves -- have been driving this debate , at the expense of those neutral parties who have taken the trouble to investigate the situation at first hand , " @entity128 said in a statement released to @entity0			1
" this , combined with the scaremongering tactics of certain small extremist groups on social networking sites , has created huge misconceptions about the current situation			0
" negative publicity such has been the negative publicity surrounding the race , @entity129 released a statement on monday quoting @entity58 parliamentary mp @entity156 , the @entity58 ambassador to @entity3 @entity157 and the @entity38 as saying that @entity3 was safe and the race should go ahead			1
but that move backfired when the @entity38 criticized @entity129 for using their quotes without permission			1
" these quotes were part of a full internal and confidential working document , that was also sent on a confidential basis to all @entity38 team managers last week , " @entity38 said in their statement			2
" @entity38 is one of 12 contestants of the @entity6 and we would never try to substitute ourselves for the @entity172 © ration @entity31 ( @entity31 ) , which is the only party entitled to determine if a grand prix should go ahead or not			1
" the situation has been further exacerbated by the condition of human rights activist @entity176 , who has been on hunger strike for close to two months after being jailed for life charged with plotting to overthrow the state			0
international rights organizations , including @entity181 , have called for his release			0
according to the @entity58 newspaper @entity184 , @entity52 reportedly phoned a leading writer and activist in @entity3 to check on @entity188 's condition and even offered to host a press conference with opposition figures			2
" ( mr @entity52 ) said he was very concerned about what is going on , " dr. @entity191 told @entity184			0
" he said the crown prince ( @entity193 ) told him that @entity188 was doing fine , but i said that i am hearing very different reports			0
" decision sunday ? this weekend will see the @entity196 take center stage			2
" as it stands we 're due to fly there ( @entity3 ) straight from @entity206 so a decision on whether the race takes place could be taken as late as sunday morning , " a spokesman for the @entity200 team told @entity0			1
" clearly it 's a situation that we would like to see resolved as soon as possible			0
i certainly do n't think it will be a case of some teams going and some not going			2
it will be everybody or nobody			0
" the team bosses will have a meeting in @entity214 ... @entity52 will of course be there and i 'm sure they will thrash something out			0
" although several former drivers , like the @entity58 1996 world champion @entity221 , have voiced concerns over the @entity26 , the current crop has been largely silent on whether the race should be won			2
" if we go , it 's a good decision to make , " two - time world champion @entity18 told @entity0 wednesday			1
" if we do n't go , we do n't go			0

leading @entity38 teams tell @entity0 they wo n't pull out of @entity26
@entity7 and @entity200 say decision rests with @entity31
@entity26 due to take place april 22
decision should be made after this weekend 's @entity234
