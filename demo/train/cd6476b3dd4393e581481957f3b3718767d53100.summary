@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 , harvesting pearls was a way of life for the people of @entity1 , a glistening archipelago of 33 islands off the coast of @entity10			1
and the world , in turn , coveted @entity1 pearls , considered the best there is			1
but with the discovery of oil in the 1930s , and as much cheaper @entity20 cultured pearls flooded international markets , @entity1 's pearling industry all but died			1
now , though , the island kingdom - by - the - sea wants to preserve its ancient pearling traditions as @entity1 prepares for a listing as an @entity27			1
" we have made a selection of several sites in the country that we felt would best reflect the pearling tradition of @entity1 , " @entity28 , @entity30 affairs counselor , told @entity2			1
" those include oyster beds in the sea , many historic houses in the urban parts of @entity0 " and a " seashore element that connects the two			0
" the island of @entity0 is @entity1 's second - largest city and its former capital			2
sections of the area will be restored and turned into a cultural heritage attraction			2
traditional houses will be refurbished and oyster beds protected by a buffer zone restricting fishing and allowing for boat tours for tourists wanting to try their hand at pearl - diving			0
@entity28 said that although pearling was an " industry that was all across the @entity58 ... @entity1 was a place that lived for pearls			1
" the heyday of @entity58 pearling occurred between 1850 and 1930			1
pearls were the world 's most valuable gem -- far eclipsing diamonds -- for most of the 19th century and earlier			1
for @entity1 , pearls were the backbone of the economy			2
tens of thousands of divers , who hunted for pearls hidden inside oysters simply by holding their breath , worked the island nation 's shallow waters with just a nose plug , leather finger gloves for protection against the sharp coral , a bag around their necks and a rope			1
@entity1 has two sources of water -- sweet freshwater springs and salty seawater -- a combination believed to have contributed to its wealth of pearls			2
the shallow water surrounding the island nation is also considered significant			0
" centuries ago , the divers would 've gone out on a boat like this -- a dhow -- which is a traditional boat , " @entity97 , who conducts pearl diving excursions in @entity1 , told @entity2			0
" the point is to get as many oysters as you can			0
with about 100 oysters , you find 10 pearls			2
" @entity97 told @entity2 that you hang a net , called a @entity106 , on your head and fill it up			0
" you use two hands			0
that 's the whole point			2
" there are now only a handful of oyster beds off @entity1 , which have not been commercially harvested for decades			0
the chances of finding a commercially viable pearl -- at least 2 mm in diameter -- are slim , experts say , and it can take years to find enough pearls to make a necklace			1
the trade of cultured pearls is forbidden in @entity1 , and there are only a handful of pearl merchants left in the country , dealing mostly in local collections of previously - held stock			1
the only pearl divers now are a few fishermen and a few local hobby divers for visitors			0
part of the pearl initiative is to encourage pearl diving in the country again , since experts believe that harvesting oysters actually helps replenish oyster beds			0
" every 10,000 oysters , we get 25 pearls with commercial value , " @entity138 of @entity139 , told @entity2			2
@entity138 , whose family has been in the pearl - trading business for 150 years , said pearls are collected , classified and stored over years			1
" this is very difficult to find something like this , " he said , showing off a perfectly round shimmering @entity1 pearl			0
" sometimes it takes two to three years and you still do n't find a round one			0
" @entity2 's @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
