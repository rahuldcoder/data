the deadly attack on the @entity4 diplomatic compound in @entity5 , @entity6 , was " likely preventable " based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings that the security situation there was deteriorating , the majority of the @entity1 concluded in a report released on wednesday			1
separately , the findings also noted what the @entity13 had told the panel -- that 15 people cooperating with its investigation had been killed in @entity5 , undercutting the investigation			1
it was not clear if the killings were related to the probe			2
moreover , it said that people linked with various @entity26 - related groups in @entity27 and elsewhere participated in the september 11 , 2012 , attack , but investigators have n't been able to determine whether any one group was in command			1
the report placed some blame for the outcome on the @entity35 , saying it should have " increased its security posture more significantly " in @entity6 's second - largest city because of general warnings that @entity4 personnel were at risk			1
the intelligence community " provided ample strategic warning " that @entity4 and @entity4 facilities were in danger , though it did n't offer a single warning that would have predicted the @entity5 attack that killed @entity4 ambassador to @entity6 @entity49 and three other @entity4 , the report said			1
but the findings did n't spare the intelligence community , saying it might have flagged potential threats to the compound had it done more analysis of " extremist - affiliated social media			2
" it also blasted @entity4 intelligence for inaccurately reporting -- without " sufficient intelligence to corroborate it " -- that a protest might have led to the attack			1
the report said the intelligence community took too long to correct the erroneous reports , " which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers			2
" the @entity68 administration initially believed the armed assault was triggered by outrage over a @entity4 - produced @entity72 film			1
it has since classified it as an organized terror attack			0
investigators have n't found evidence of pre-planning and suggest at least part of the attack was " opportunistic			0
" that suggests a vulnerability for diplomatic facilities , because attacks can happen with little warning , the report said			0
questions around security and intelligence as well as the slow - to - evolve and changing explanation fueled a ferocious response from @entity92 in @entity93 , who have sharply criticized the administration and continue to investigate			1
@entity96 report casts doubt on @entity26 involvement in @entity5 a @entity35 spokeswoman , @entity99 , said the report largely affirms the findings of an independent review of the @entity5 matter that recommended steps -- since undertaken by the agency -- to improve security at diplomatic facilities worldwide			1
on the issue of whether the attacks were preventable , @entity99 noted that " we have repeatedly said there was no specific threat " pointing to an attack			0
" obviously , we 've talked at length about the fact that we knew there were extremists and terrorists operating in @entity6 and in @entity5			0
but , again , we had no specific information indicating a threat an attack was coming , " she said			0
the @entity1 report follows the release on monday of previously classified information by the @entity125			2
according to the documents , senior military officials told the panel there were no discussions related to any specific threat in @entity6 despite general warnings about the possibility of terror attacks around the anniversary of 9/11			0
as a result , additional military assets were not deployed to the area			0
on the investigation , the @entity13 was quoted in the report as saying the 15 deaths have severely hampered its probe			1
" the @entity13 's investigation into the individuals responsible for the @entity5 attacks has been hampered by inadequate cooperation and a lack of capacity by foreign governments to hold these perpetrators accountable , making the pursuit of justice for the attacks slow and insufficient , " the report said			2
" as a result , key information gaps remain about the potential foreknowledge and complicity of @entity6 militia groups and security forces , the level of pre-planning for the attacks , the perpetrators and their involvement in other terrorist activities and the motivation for the attacks			0
" several @entity169 issued a separate set of conclusions			0
committee vice chairman @entity172 of @entity173 , @entity174 of @entity175 , @entity176 of @entity177 , @entity178 of @entity179 , and @entity180 of @entity181 said failures that led to the attack could be partly related to @entity68 's failure , in their words , to establish a clear detention policy for terror suspects that gets the most out of intelligence collection			1
instead of sending terror suspects directly to the military facility at @entity193 , @entity194 , the administration has temporarily interrogated suspects on @entity197 ships , sometimes for weeks at a time , before sending them to the @entity4 for trial			2
" president @entity68 and his administration must end their efforts to close the detention facility at @entity193 and must develop a clear , cogent policy for the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists , " the @entity199 wrote			0
@entity92 rep : @entity5 not a ' complete cover - up '			0
