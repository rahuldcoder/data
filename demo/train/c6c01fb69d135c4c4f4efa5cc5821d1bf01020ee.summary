-- the @entity1 condemned @entity3 's laws on abortion thursday , ruling the country violated the human rights of a woman forced to go abroad to end her pregnancy			1
it did not , however , recommend a change to @entity3 law , which prohibits abortion in all cases			1
the woman , a @entity15 national who was not named , was in remission from a rare form of cancer and unaware she was pregnant when she had a series of check - ups that are not advised during pregnancy , the court said			0
she felt the pregnancy would cause a relapse of her cancer and was also concerned about the health of the fetus if she continued to term			0
she claimed she could not obtain clear advice about her options , so she decided in 2005 to have an abortion in @entity30			0
the woman said she suffered medical complications on her return to @entity3			2
having an abortion in @entity3 carries a penalty of life imprisonment			2
women in @entity3 are permitted to travel abroad for abortions and obtain information about their options for doing so			1
the @entity41 ruled in 1992 that abortion is lawful in @entity3 if there is a risk to the mother 's life , but the @entity3 @entity47 has never passed a law guaranteeing that right			1
the @entity51 court , located in @entity52 , @entity53 , ruled that , by failing to allow the woman to have a lawful abortion in @entity3 , the country violated her right to respect for her physical and psychological integrity , which falls under @entity59			1
at the same time , the court ruled @entity60 can not be interpreted as conferring a right to abortion , which may come as a relief to defenders of the @entity3 ban			2
it had been thought a more serious ruling by the court could have challenged the country 's laws on abortion			0
the court ordered @entity3 to pay the woman 15,000 euros ( $ 19,800 ) in damages			2
while the court condemned the @entity3 ban , it rejected the complaints of two @entity3 women who sued along with the @entity15 national , saying there had been no violation of their human rights			1
it also dismissed the rest of the @entity15 woman 's complaints , which fell under @entity83 and 3 of the human rights convention and concerned the right to life and prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment			1
proving that her pregnancy posed a risk to her life required the @entity15 woman to establish it either with her doctor or through the courts			0
the court said going to her doctor was " ineffective , " however , because the criminality of abortion posed a " significant chilling factor " in any discussions about it			0
" they both ran a risk of a serious criminal conviction and imprisonment if an initial doctor 's opinion that abortion was an option , as it posed a risk to the woman 's health , was later found to be against the @entity3 constitution , " the court found			1
" @entity3 's failure to legislate to protect the rights of women has been clearly exposed by the @entity1 today , " said @entity116 , director of the @entity117 , in a statement			1
" it is imperative that the government legislate swiftly to ensure that women are able to exercise their existing constitutional rights			0
" yet again , it has required international intervention to remind our legislature of their domestic responsibilities , " said @entity116 , who is in @entity126 attending a global civil rights leaders meeting			0
" if @entity3 wishes to reassert its sovereignty and its standing in the international community , it must start by fully respecting the human rights of people at home			1
" @entity3 health minister @entity141 said in a statement thursday that the government will have to legislate on the issue in the wake of the court 's ruling			2
the government " will have to come forward with proposals , but it will take time , " @entity141 said in an interview , according to the @entity3 government 's website			0
she added it was a " highly complex area , " but said she felt the ruling was a " binding judgment			0
" the @entity3 government argued the woman should have tried to go through the @entity3 court system to prove her pregnancy was a risk to her life , but the court said that would have been ineffective because it would be " inappropriate " to ask a woman to go through complex constitutional proceedings if her life was at risk			2
the constitutional courts are also not able to determine whether a woman qualifies for a lawful abortion , the court said			0
neither avenue , therefore , allowed the woman effective and accessible ways to establish her right to a lawful abortion in @entity3 , the court said			2
the court also lamented the fact that a woman 's right to an abortion in @entity3 if her health is at risk has never been put into law			1
@entity183 praised the ruling as a " wake - up call to the @entity3 government " to regulate access to abortion			0
" this morning the @entity1 established that this is not just tragic , it is a violation of human rights			1
and it must end now , " said @entity190 , women 's rights advocacy director at @entity183			0
a january 2010 report from the human rights group says @entity3 women face financial , logistical , physical , and emotional burdens imposed by the laws of @entity3 that force them to seek abortions abroad , without support from the state			1
the three women who brought the case in @entity52 had personally suffered these ordeals , the group said			0
" it is time for the government to end their ostrich mentality regarding abortion and start delivering on women 's human rights , " @entity190 said .			1

the @entity1 rules the ban violated a woman 's human rights
she was forced to travel abroad for an abortion in 2005
