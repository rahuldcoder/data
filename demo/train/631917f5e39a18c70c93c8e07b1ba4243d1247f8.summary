-- with her doe eyes , razor - sharp cheek bones , flowing jet black locks and the most talked - about rump in the business , it 's no wonder she 's on the cover of arguably the world 's most prestigious fashion magazine			1
but in an unusual twist , the beguiling female bearing all on the front of this month 's @entity13 is n't a model , actress , or musician			1
she 's not even human			2
instead , the beautiful creature gracing the landmark @entity20 edition of the magazine is a six - year - old horse called @entity23			1
not just any horse , but perhaps the greatest race horse of all time , unbeaten in a staggering 22 consecutive competitions across the globe and worth more than $ 7 million in prize money			1
@entity30 has featured @entity32 - winning actresses , princesses and supermodels on its front covers , but now for the first time in the magazine 's 53 - year history it will be a four - legged beauty looking out from the publication 's most important page			1
and @entity13 is about celebrating the beautiful , " @entity30 editor , @entity43 , told @entity0			1
" what goes on @entity13 's cover can create news in itself			2
it was n't just that @entity23 was on the cover of any women 's magazine			1
the endorsement of the @entity13 brand is a very big statement			0
" since demolishing the field in her first win in the 2009 @entity59 , an air of mystique has followed the world champion sprinter			2
her unblemished 22 - win record is the second highest of all time , only trailing behind @entity65 horse @entity63 , which apparently took 54 races in the late 1800s			2
@entity68 personally congratulated the magnificent mare after her nailbiting win at the prestigious @entity71 in july			0
it was later revealed the thoroughbred had won the esteemed title with a leg injury -- only adding to her mythical invincibility			0
unsurprisingly , horse racing - mad @entity20 have taken the champion thoroughbred to their hearts , with diehard @entity23 fans even traveling to the other side of the world to cheer her on at @entity84 's @entity83			1
" her allegiance level is phenomenal , " @entity85 , one of @entity23 's eight owners , said			1
" she 's a powerful horse who just fronts up every time and people really like that consistency			1
" " i do n't know if she 'll replace @entity94 -- the gelding who dominated the @entity20 racing scene during the @entity98 of the 1930s -- but in the pantheon of equine greats she will stand very tall			0
" @entity13 had wanted to " celebrate all things @entity20 " for their december issue , believing @entity23 vividly embodied the country 's unique " fighting spirit			1
" " @entity20 are passionate about horse racing			0
we 're the only country in the world that literally stops for a horse race -- the @entity111 , " @entity43 said			2
" we love a champion and @entity23 strives to win even when the chips are down -- those principles are very dear to us			1
" the photo shoot took place in a secret location in the @entity118 , just outside of @entity119			1
@entity20 photographer @entity120 captured the thoroughbred alongside compatriot model @entity122 in a purpose - built outdoor studio			0
" @entity23 definitely realizes when the camera is on her			2
her ears go up , she sticks her head out , it 's almost like she 's posing , " @entity43 said			0
" @entity130 's such a magnificent - looking animal			0
her coat is this extraordinary pitch black , almost like velvet , with this handsomely structured face and that awesome rump that propels her so fast			0
" @entity23 's owners have gone to great lengths to ensure her persona is aligned with sophistication and style			1
everything from her name , to her salmon - colored silks and even her own line of grooming products are modeled on classy femininity			0
" @entity13 is synonymous with style , glamor , celebrity and exclusivity			0
that a horse has appeared on the front cover says something about both horse racing and the horse itself , " @entity153 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity155 , said			1
" i think the sports market has now gone beyond simple endorsement , " he added			0
" it 's now more a form of strategic collaboration where brands with convergent interests associate themselves with one another			0
" it is a momentous cover for the magazine which has largely steered cleared of controversial models			0
among its more historic front pages was the september 1993 issue featuring @entity176 , the magazine 's first aboriginal model			2
however , " this is definitely our most unusual cover , " said @entity43			0
for many aspiring models , gracing the cover of @entity13 would be the ultimate elevation to ' it girl ' status			0
galling then , that @entity23 seems to have beaten them to the post yet again .			2
