-- when @entity2 was five years old , she began to exhibit a strange and troubling symptom : every time she stood up for more than two minutes , she collapsed			1
the episodes were particularly bad after @entity2 had been sitting or lying down for prolonged stretches , such as when she woke up in the morning or walked between classes at school			1
" @entity10 was always a disaster , " recalls @entity9 , @entity2 's mother			1
after sitting or kneeling for a time , @entity2 would stand up with the congregation and invariably fall down			1
as @entity2 got older , other worrisome signs emerged			1
her eyelids began to droop			0
she continued to wet the bed and suffered from constant bladder infections			0
and , about once a week , she experienced extreme hypoglycemic episodes -- a sudden drop in blood sugar levels -- that left her shaking and unable to function for the rest of the day			0
the @entity23 visited a parade of doctors and specialists who considered , and ultimately ruled out , a grab bag of diagnoses : epilepsy , diabetes , cancer , liver failure , kidney failure			0
one time , after testing @entity2 for epilepsy , a neurologist observed that she appeared to have a severe form of orthostatic hypotension , a not - unusual condition in which a person 's blood pressure drops suddenly upon standing or sitting up , causing the sensation known as a head rush			1
@entity0 : surgery saves girl 's face from rare disorder the doctor was only half right			0
@entity2 did have orthostatic hypotension , but the underlying cause was a far more exotic condition that would n't be diagnosed until she was an adult			1
in the meantime , she had to cope with having blood pressure that could dive from a relatively normal 110/70 when she was lying down to 50/30 upon standing			2
" i 've seen dead people with higher blood pressure , " one nurse told her			0
a family affair it was clear from the first minute of her life that @entity2 was n't in good health			1
she was a small baby , barely five pounds , in a family that had a history of strapping , nine - pound newborns , and she immediately required oxygen for respiratory distress			0
" she was literally blue , " @entity9 remembers			0
later , as an infant , @entity2 's sucking reflux was so poor that her mother was n't able to nurse her			1
orthopedists said her motor coordination was below average and referred her for physical therapy			0
when @entity2 was eight years old , her brother , @entity75 , was born			1
as he grew up , he too would develop symptoms similar to hers , suggesting the mysterious condition had a genetic component			0
@entity2 's parents continued visiting doctors , seeking explanations for what ailed the two siblings			1
while some people get the occasional head rush or dizzy spell , @entity2 and @entity75 experienced the sensation almost constantly			1
" mostly it was a feeling as if you 're going to black out , like walking through life with permanent black spots , " @entity2 says			1
@entity2 learned how to compensate for the strange spells			1
at school , if she had to climb a flight of stairs to get to a class , she 'd sit on the landing to regain her composure or lean over and pretend to tie her shoes			0
she even played softball throughout high school , although she needed a teammate to run the bases for her			0
@entity0 : doctors induce 5 - month coma to save woman 's life @entity2 and her brother lived like this for years			1
finally , after @entity2 had graduated from college and was living on her own in @entity114 , a psychiatrist at the @entity116 began to unravel the mystery			1
after hearing a description of the @entity121 children , the psychiatrist said some of their symptoms resembled those of a rare disorder he was researching : dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency ( @entity128 )			1
as the name suggests , people with @entity128 lack dopamine beta hydroxylase , an enzyme needed to convert the neurotransmitter dopamine into norepinephrine and epinephrine ( also known as adrenaline ) , hormones that are critical to maintaining normal blood pressure			1
the psychiatrist suggested the @entity23 fly @entity75 , who was still in high school and living at the family home in @entity142 , to see a specialist at @entity144 , in @entity145 , @entity146 " it was like winning the lottery , " @entity2 says			1
an ' extraordinarily rare ' condition @entity150 , @entity151 , a neurologist at @entity144 's @entity152 , is the country 's leading @entity128 expert			1
in 1986 , he was the first person to identify the disorder , in a 33 - year - old woman who had n't opened her eyes for the first five days of her life -- a common feature of @entity128			1
after performing blood work and numerous other tests on the woman , @entity150 and his colleagues recognized that her abnormally low norepinephrine levels were caused by a genetic defect in dopamine beta hydroxylase			1
it was thought that no one could survive for long without norepinephrine , but that woman lived to be 62			0
if people with @entity128 are in a situation where they 're unable to sit or fall down safely , the resulting loss of blood flow to the brain can be fatal , but most people with the condition learn how to compensate and can live a relatively long life , @entity150 says			2
@entity0 : 10 states where rare and exotic diseases lurk @entity150 confirmed the suspicions of the @entity116 psychiatrist and diagnosed 15 - year - old @entity75 with @entity128			1
the diagnosis put @entity75 in very exclusive company			0
" @entity128 is extraordinarily rare , " says @entity150 , who is also the principal investigator of the @entity181 at the @entity182			2
it is so rare , in fact , that the 10 patients @entity150 personally has seen represent the lion 's share of the documented cases worldwide			0
another eight patients have been identified in @entity188 and @entity189 , though @entity150 says there could be thousands more still undiagnosed			0
a night and day treatment in the late 1980s , @entity150 began to formulate a drug to treat the norepinephrine deficiency associated with @entity128 , but he soon learned that such a drug was already being marketed in @entity195			1
@entity196 , also known as @entity196 , was being used in that country for @entity198 , a movement disorder characterized by dopamine deficiency			2
@entity201 's first patient responded immediately to droxidopa			0
" the drug allowed us to replace the norepinephrine not only in the blood , but even in the nerve cells of the body , " @entity150 says			0
@entity0 : prescription drugs that lead double lives @entity75 , too , responded to droxidopa within days			0
two years later , he ran a victory lap of sorts across the @entity212 in @entity114 , while his sister watched			2
@entity2 had visited @entity144 soon after @entity75			2
not surprisingly , @entity150 diagnosed her with @entity128 , but due to a protocol change in the clinical trial he was leading , @entity2 had to wait three years before she could take droxidopa herself			1
when she finally did the results were just as dramatic			0
" i felt different immediately , " @entity2 says			2
" this feeling of strength -- being able to walk up a hill in @entity114 at the same pace as my friends , or actually [ being ] able to do it without sitting down -- was incredible			0
" @entity2 herself took a sprint across the @entity212 as part of her training for the @entity227			2
she finished that race in a little over six hours in the winter of 2005			0
in 2010 , she completed an @entity231 - length triathlon : a 1,500 - meter swim , 40 - kilometer bike ride , and @entity234			2
" for me it was like checking this off the list , " @entity2 says			2
" i was so grateful for my new physicality			0
" @entity2 takes 300 milligrams of droxidopa three times a day , and even now , a decade after her diagnosis , feels lightheaded if she misses a dose			2
she no longer runs marathons but climbs @entity114 's steep hills with ease			2
" it 's such a small thing in the grand scheme of things , being able to walk a block up the hill , " she says			0
" people take it for granted			0
i was like , ' this is incredible			0

@entity2 and her brother would collapse after standing for two minutes
the siblings were diagnosed with dopamine beta hydroxylase deficiency ( @entity128 )
after receiving proper treatment , @entity2 ran marathons , completed triathlons
