@entity0 -- @entity2 has been doing something he 's never really done before : talking publicly about running for president			1
as he does the television interview circuit this week around the release of a new book , " @entity8 : forging an @entity17 , " the former @entity10 governor and son and brother of former presidents is openly discussing his thinking on a run for the @entity16 in 2016			1
@entity2 told @entity1 on tuesday he would n't make a decision in the near future			2
asked if he 'll make a decision in 2014 , @entity2 said he did n't know and added that " the only thing i 've decided is i 'm not going to think about it for 2013			0
it 's just too far out for me personally			0
" @entity2 passed on running for the @entity25 presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012			1
instead , he 's filled the role of a party elder statesman since leaving office in january 2007 after two terms as governor			0
hanging over @entity2 is what can be described as @entity2 fatigue -- the idea that a @entity2 bid for the @entity16 would carry his family 's political baggage			1
his father , @entity37 , served one term before losing his 1992 re-election campaign against then - @entity41 gov. @entity40			0
the elder @entity2 angered many conservatives by breaking his " no new taxes " pledge			0
brother @entity45 served two terms but left office in january 2009 as a very unpopular president , even among @entity25 , who were angered by his support of federal spending increases and his 2008 bailout of @entity52 during the financial crisis			2
from @entity54 to 9/11 , @entity2 41 opens up about his presidential son that lingering feeling was a factor behind @entity2 's decision not to run in the past election cycle , even though some @entity25 urged him to consider a bid , said @entity1 chief political analyst @entity61			1
" one of the reasons that i think @entity2 decided not to run this last time was that he thought there was still @entity2 fatigue in this country , " @entity61 said			2
" so the question is , if you skip ahead , four more years , will there still be @entity2 fatigue ? we just do n't know			0
" and if @entity2 does run , his family ties will put him in uncharted territory , said @entity1 polling director @entity74			2
" there have been plenty of presidential candidates whose fathers also ran for president , and a few whose brothers have been candidates			0
but if @entity2 throws his hat in the ring , he will be the first candidate in history who fits into both categories , " @entity74 added			0
" does that help because the @entity2 ' brand name ' is well known , or hurt because @entity2 would be judged by the public based on things he did not do himself ? historically speaking , there is no way to tell			2
" read more : @entity2 's controversial immigration proposals but @entity25 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity94 said @entity2 is free of the @entity2 fatigue , at least among @entity25			1
" i think the @entity2 fatigue does n't apply to @entity2			0
and even if it did , among @entity25 it 's been replaced with @entity102 fatigue , " said @entity97 , a longtime friend and supporter of the former @entity10 governor			2
if @entity2 does decide to run , and were he to win the 2016 @entity25 nomination , he could face off in the general election against a member of another famous political family -- @entity107			1
while the former first lady , senator , presidential candidate and secretary of state says she has no plans to run again for the @entity16 , she has n't ruled out a bid , and if she did run , she 'd be the early favorite to win her party 's nomination			1
and if @entity2 does n't run , there 's the chance we could see a future @entity16 bid from the next generation of the @entity2 family			1
both of @entity2 's sons are considering runs for public office			1
@entity2 told @entity1 that he now understands what his father went through			0
" i know what my dad feels like , why he would get emotional every time he was in a setting where @entity37 or i were in pursuit of some office of some kind			0
