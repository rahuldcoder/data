-- @entity1 arrives in @entity2 on friday for a handful of fundraisers and closed - door meetings with local @entity6 , the latest in a series of expeditions to key primary states as he mulls a presidential bid in 2016			1
in @entity11 , early signs of the 2016 presidential race if the @entity19 senator decides to embark on a @entity21 run , a likely prospect according to those around him , his @entity2 foray crystallizes what could be a central challenge as a @entity6 candidate : assuaging skeptical donors in the party 's establishment without rankling the grass - roots activists who helped lift him to national prominence			1
2016 watch : @entity1 's travel plans very telling how well he straddles those two worlds could very well determine if the diminutive ophthalmologist can re-shape the party in his own image			1
" it 's going to be a hard line to walk , " said @entity37 , a @entity2 @entity6 consultant			1
" but he is bridging some gaps that we have n't seen before from another @entity6			0
" as @entity1 's advisers began sorting out his political travels earlier this spring , they worked hand - in - hand with the @entity46 to set up two very different kinds of fundraisers designed to appeal to two different wings of the party			1
@entity1 's first order of business friday is a $ 1,500 - a - plate luncheon in @entity54 , a run - of - the - mill " high dollar " event that raises money for the @entity46 and offers a handful of wealthy @entity6 donors a chance to get close to the potential presidential candidate and chat candidly behind closed doors			1
friday 's trip is @entity1 's political debut in the early primary state , and the session with donors is just introductory			2
compared to the kind of money thrown around in the heat of a presidential election , the ticket price also happens to be quite modest			0
but these white tablecloth sessions with old - line donors are sure to become increasingly important to @entity1 if he wants to prove his viability to @entity6 brahmins			1
with individual contributions capped at $ 2,600 under federal election law , @entity1 will need more than just online fundraising and a series of " money bombs , " small donor activity that helped his father raise competitive sums during his insurgent campaigns , to compete on a national level for the long haul			0
" you ca n't raise enough libertarian @entity95 money and hope to win , " said @entity89 , the former @entity90 secretary of state who lost to @entity1 in his 2010 @entity92 primary			1
" at $ 2,600 increments , you have to break into establishment money to win the nomination , even if the field is fractured , because it will eventually consolidate			0
" later friday , @entity1 heads to the state capital of @entity103 for a casual " low - dollar " fundraiser with a menu of barbecue and sweet tea at the state farmer 's market , a chance to mingle with grass - roots activists who purchased tickets for $ 40 a pop. @entity1 's political team also arranged a pair of intimate , off - the - record meetings with activists from the @entity2 " liberty movement " who were intensely loyal to his father , former @entity121 rep. @entity95 , during his two underdog presidential bids in 2008 and 2012			1
it 's a small but vocal grass - roots constituency that remains deeply resentful of the very party establishment that @entity1 will be courting , and raising money for , earlier in the day			1
since his unexpected rise to the @entity92 in 2010 , the younger @entity1 has been viewed with suspicion in certain corners of the libertarian movement , in part because he has taken some more hawkish foreign policy stands than his father , such as supporting sanctions on @entity133			2
he also has revealed a pragmatic streak as his stature , and ambitions , have grown			0
@entity1 has cozied up to @entity92 minority leader @entity137 , a beacon of the @entity6 establishment who backed @entity89 in that 2010 primary , and he endorsed @entity6 presidential candidate @entity142 last summer when @entity95 was still , technically , a candidate for the nomination , irking many of his libertarian devotees			1
@entity1 's advisers are up - front about the differences between the senator and his father			1
" there are some people from the more libertarian side who do n't see @entity1 as libertarian enough , even though he has a more libertarian voting record than any senator in my lifetime , " said @entity151 , one of @entity1 's political aides			1
" he is not a libertarian , he is a libertarian - leaning @entity6			0
" @entity1 faces blowback after new drone comments in @entity2 , at least , libertarian activists seem willing to let @entity1 rub elbows with the establishment if it helps him push the party in their ideological direction			1
" @entity1 has moved the playing field right down to the goal line , " said @entity170 , a self - described " liberty activist " from @entity171 who backed @entity95 in the past two cycles			1
" he is politically more deft than @entity95			0
he realizes that he has a game to play			0
he is aligning himself with mainstream , but 95 % of his political beliefs are similar to @entity95 's			2
" @entity170 , though , said he is skipping @entity1 's tour through @entity2 because his events are raising money for the state @entity46 , an institution that @entity170 and other libertarians in the state loudly resent			1
much of the anxiety surrounding @entity1 in @entity2 is coming not from his activist base but from the traditional donor class -- even some with long ties to former @entity2 sen. @entity189 , who supported @entity1 in 2010 and welcomed him into the @entity92 's " @entity190 " after his victory			1
" @entity1 is probably a little too out there , maybe , for me , " said @entity192 , a longtime financial backer of @entity189 's who said , for now , that he 's more intrigued by @entity195 @entity194 and @entity196 in 2016			1
" i do n't have anything against him			0
he is just a little more outside of the tradition of the people i would tend to gravitate towards			0
" @entity6 donor @entity200 , a @entity103 signage manufacturer who tried , unsuccessfully , to lure @entity189 into the 2012 presidential race , was more blunt			0
" the biggest thing that will hurt ( @entity1 ) with people like me is he 's got to distance himself from his dad , " @entity200 said			2
" i live in the real world , and the real world says you ca n't ignore certain things , you ca n't ignore the other countries in the world , and the government is here , and it has a purpose			0
we got what we got , and we have to make the best of it			0
" that concern -- that @entity1 is a pie - in - the - sky ideologue who ca n't be bothered by the grim realities of governing -- emerged as a common theme in conversations with members of the @entity2 business community			1
" being a slight libertarian myself , i agree with a lot of his issues , " said @entity229 , a well - connected @entity103 attorney			0
" but i am also a practical business guy			0
you ca n't maintain those hard - line libertarian views and be a chief executive			1
my gut is that @entity1 is not one of those gets - things - done guys			2
" @entity151 , the @entity1 adviser , said he 's heard similar worries from potential supporters before , going back to the 2010 campaign in @entity19 when @entity1 would meet with @entity246 - types in @entity247 and @entity248			1
in later fundraising swings around the country , in tony locales like @entity252 and @entity253 , @entity151 said @entity1 has used a personal touch to soothe fretful donors who just do n't think he can win			0
" the best part about @entity1 is you put him in the room with them and they become way less skeptical , " he said			0
" he is a smart , reasonable person and i do n't know that they are expecting the person that they meet			0
they will walk out , almost to a man , less skeptical			0
that 's why we go to these things			0
that 's why we do @entity46 events and not just activist events			2
" in a state with eight military installations , @entity1 has the added burden of convincing the @entity2 establishment that he wo n't push @entity279 foreign policy in an isolationist direction that could affect the livelihoods of thousands of veterans and military families			1
@entity1 : helping @entity285 rebels a dangerous risk @entity1 's national security views are leavened by his fidelity to protecting personal liberties			2
he fiercely opposes drone strikes and military intervention overseas , and he has condemned the recently revealed @entity293 surveillance program -- positions that put him at odds with @entity2 's hawkish sen. @entity296 , a reservist in the state 's @entity297			2
" there are some mainstream @entity6 who are concerned that people who come from @entity1 's side of the party do not stand for strong national defense , " said @entity37 , the @entity6 consultant			2
" he needs to make clear , especially in @entity2 , which is full of vets and people who support the military , that he is not a threat to them			0
" @entity309 , a state senator who endorsed the elder @entity1 in 2012 , argued that @entity1 's views are " obviously more mainstream " than his father 's			2
but even if @entity1 ca n't persuade @entity46 elders to back him in a presidential campaign , he predicted , they might be able to persuade themselves			2
" keep in mind that the establishment always seems to gravitate toward a winner , " @entity309 said			0
" if he is a front - runner , the establishment will find a way to support him			0

sen. @entity1 , @entity19 , is considering a 2016 @entity21 bid
challenge for @entity1 could be winning @entity46 establishment while keeping libertarian grass - roots
" it 's going to be a hard line to walk , " a @entity2 @entity46 consultant says
@entity1 is the son of former rep. @entity95 , @entity330 , a well - known libertarian
