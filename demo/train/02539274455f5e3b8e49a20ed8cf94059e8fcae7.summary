" pack your bags you 're going to @entity2			2
" these are the words nine young @entity5 defectors had waited years to hear having traveled thousands of miles			1
unfortunately it was a lie			2
the tragic story of this group of youngsters aged between 15 and 23 takes us back a few years when one by one they managed to cross the heavily - guarded border from @entity5 into @entity14 to search for food			1
most of them were orphans , while others had a parent unable or unwilling to look after them			2
a @entity2 missionary living in @entity14 , known only as @entity21 to protect his identity , tried to help the youngsters and has broken his silence to @entity25			1
" this one child used to live with his father , " he explained			2
" one day his father went into a @entity28 trying to find food but was caught and beaten to death on the spot			1
the child witnessed this ... his mother then told him not to come home and threw rocks at him to keep him away			2
" rodents ' a luxury ' the youngsters survived by foraging for scraps in trashcans			1
fish bones and discarded rice were mixed to make a porridge , while rodents were considered a luxury			2
when @entity21 first met some of them in december 2009 , they had frostbite on their hands and toes from living in an old abandoned building where temperatures plummeted to as low as minus 30 degrees @entity54			0
some of them had injuries from beatings by security guards and merchants when they were caught stealing food			1
one of the nine , a 20 - year - old man , told @entity21 he wanted to live in @entity14 as " even beggars in @entity14 do not go hungry			1
" " these kids were suffering from malnutrition and disease , " recalled @entity21 " they had been living in quarters with bad sanitation ... also they all seemed to have suffered in one form or another from tuberculosis			0
because they were suffering from malnutrition , their growth was stunted			0
" read more : report describes @entity5 ' atrocities ' @entity21 and his wife offered to help the youngsters leave @entity14 for @entity78 -- a landlocked country in @entity80 -- and then onto a third country , perhaps @entity2 or the @entity82 to claim asylum			1
it is a route that is well traveled by defectors , and the missionary couple had already helped other @entity5 escape to a better life that way			1
living in fear the nine lived with the couple and several other @entity5 defectors in @entity14 for almost two years in constant fear of being discovered by the authorities			1
they could never leave the house during this time			0
@entity14 does n't treat @entity5 in its territory as refugees and usually sends them back across the border			1
" the children had been fugitives for a long time so they were used to this situation , " he said			0
" we had a bed which was buttressed with quite a few books on the bottom as legs			0
the kids would go under the bed and kick out the books , so the bed would sit low and it would not look like anyone was hiding under it			0
" the couple tried to organize adoptive parents for the youngsters in the @entity82 but without success			1
and so the long trip to the @entity78 border began			2
the youngsters experienced some firsts along the way : one defector celebrated his birthday for the very first time ; they visited an amusement park , which was a new experience ; and they played barefoot on a beach for the first time			2
finally , they were able to enjoy simple pleasures many children across the world take for granted			0

" they started having hopes , they started dreaming and i know they were happier			0
i was overjoyed to have done something worthwhile			0
" the escape after successfully getting six other defectors out of the country to safety via other routes , the missionary couple paid a broker to transport the remaining nine across the @entity14 - @entity78 border because they had no papers or passports			1
on about may 10 this year , they embarked on a journey that would take them through the jungle in the dead of night to avoid detection			0
this journey would ordinarily take 40 minutes , according to the missionaries , but this time it took four hours due to heavier than usual border security that day			0
but crossing the border proved to be the easy part			0
on a bus en route to the capital , an unexpected police search changed the course of events			0
the youngsters were detained and then investigated for more than two weeks by @entity78 immigration officials because of their lack of paperwork			1
@entity21 admitted the police search surprised him as it had never happened with previous refugees he had helped pass through the country			2
@entity21 's wife said they repeatedly called the @entity177 in @entity78 for help			2
" we pled our case with the embassy because this was not just about one life but nine lives of young people ... for the embassy it was extra work and a burden to them and why should they care about these children from @entity5 ? " @entity21 said embassy officials told them to wait and do nothing to jeopardize things as @entity78 authorities were working to process the youngsters			1
he said no - one from the embassy visited them in eighteen days			0
bitter truth on may 27 , the @entity78 authorities told the youngsters to pack as they were being sent to @entity2			1
@entity21 said they were so happy they all shouted for joy			0
years in hiding seemed to finally be over			0
but the bitter truth of the situation soon became clear			0
the missionary couple was prevented from following the children and instead locked in a room at the immigration offices for two hours			1
the @entity211 ' refugee agency , @entity210 , said the group had been sent back to @entity5 via @entity14			1

" in these children 's minds , they were going to @entity2 , " said @entity21 's wife			0
" they never imagined after crossing the border to @entity78 they would be sent back to @entity5			1
" the children have since been used for propaganda purposes in @entity228 , appearing on state - run television in june claiming they had been tricked into leaving @entity5 and expressing thanks to leader @entity231 for saving them and bringing them back			1
" what i am concerned about is what is going to happen after the propaganda is gone and the rhetoric is over , " said @entity21 " if we do n't pay attention , if we do n't keep asking where these children are , then these children will be lost forever and we will never know what happened to them			0
" @entity78 was widely criticized for its actions by the @entity211 and human rights groups but insists the youngsters were in their country illegally and that the missionaries were effectively human traffickers			1
@entity2 's foreign ministry told @entity25 it prioritizes the life and safety of @entity5 defectors and is " inspecting the problems revealed from this incident and has improved and strengthened the overall support system			1
" but @entity21 and his wife fear for the nine youngsters , who dreamed of a life without hunger and fear .			2
