-- two @entity2 - inspired victories offered @entity3 a glimmer of hope in their quest to retain the @entity7 after another day dominated by brilliance from the @entity9			1
despite @entity2 's heroics , @entity11 's team took a commanding 10 - 6 lead with only the 12 singles match to come on sunday			1
the last time a team came back from such a large deficit was at the infamous clash at @entity18 in 1999 when @entity19 capped a superb fightback for the @entity9			1
but after taking five points from a possible eight on offer , @entity11 's side are firmly in the driving seat and on course to record their first victory since 2008			0
day two of the @entity7 as it happened sunday would have been a procession had it not been for @entity31 's @entity2 , who revels in the matchplay format in the @entity7 and kept @entity3 captain @entity34 's dream alive			1
he made five straight birdies on the final five holes as he and world no. 1 @entity38 wrestled a point from @entity41 and @entity42			2
and his ten foot putt on the final hole to secure victory was greeted with wild scenes of celebration from a @entity3 team that had looked down and out at one stage on saturday			1
" it comes from within , " @entity2 said of yet another strong performance in the @entity7			1
" if we can do anything to get our hands on this trophy , with @entity57 ( @entity58 , who died in 2011 ) looking down on us , you 've got to do what you 've got to do			0
" we 've got a chance and that 's all we could 've done			0
we 've got to take it to them tomorrow - it 's that simple			0
i want to go out early tomorrow			0
" @entity38 said of his afternoon partner : " we needed something to happen , some sort of spark , and after 13 , @entity2 took over from there			1
" all the credit needs to be put on this man			0
we can feed off his positivity , for sure			0
we clawed it back thanks to some incredible golf from @entity2			2
" shortly before @entity2 and @entity38 's victory , @entity76 and @entity77 held on for a narrow victory over @entity80 and 14 - time major winner @entity81 , who has now lost all three matches he has played in @entity83			1
but in the afternoon 's other two matches @entity84 and @entity85 trounced @entity87 and @entity88 5 & 4 while @entity89 and @entity90 defeated @entity91 and @entity92 one up			2
earlier , @entity2 and @entity87 spared @entity3 a humiliating whitewash in the morning foursomes			1
the @entity31 pairing edged past @entity84 and @entity96 , grabbing a precious point on the 18th green			0
" it was absolutely key			0
@entity34 put us out number one for a reason and that was to get a point , " @entity2 said			0
but it was the high point on an otherwise miserable morning for the @entity3 team			1
@entity107 and @entity76 were hammered 7 & 6 by @entity108 and @entity109 with @entity42 and @entity41 heaping on further misery with a 2 & 1 win over @entity92 and @entity77			0
@entity38 and @entity112 were also unable to stem the @entity9 tide conceding defeat to @entity115 and @entity116 on the final green			2
despite their two dramatic victories on the 18th green , @entity3 still have a mountain to climb on sunday , needing eight points from the 12 on offer to retain the trophy .			2

@entity9 lead @entity3 10 - 6 going into final day of 39th @entity7
@entity9 dominate morning foursomes but late afternoon points give @entity3 hope
@entity81 loses third straight match after being rested for first time in @entity7
two @entity2 inspired matches help @entity3 cling onto @entity9 coat tails
