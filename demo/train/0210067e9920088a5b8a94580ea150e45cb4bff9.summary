-- ephemeral messaging apps such as @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 , all of which advertise that your photo , message or update will only be accessible for a short period , are on the rise			1
@entity4 and @entity6 , for example , claim they permanently delete messages , photos and videos after 10 seconds			1
after that , there 's no record			1
this notion is especially popular with young people , and these apps are an antidote to sites such as @entity25 where everything you post lasts forever unless you take it down -- and taking it down is no guarantee that it is n't still available			1
these ephemeral apps are the first concerted push against the permanence of @entity34 conversation			1
we started losing ephemeral conversation when computers began to mediate our communications			1
computers naturally produce conversation records , and that data was often saved and archived			0
the powerful and famous -- from @entity42 back in 1987 to @entity43 in 2011 -- have been brought down by e-mails , texts , tweets and posts they thought private			0
lots of us have been embroiled in more personal embarrassments resulting from things we 've said either being saved for too long or shared too widely			0
people have reacted to this permanent nature of internet communications in ad hoc ways			0
we 've deleted our stuff where possible and asked others not to forward our writings without permission			0
" @entity65 scrubbing " is the term used to describe the deletion of @entity25 posts			0
sociologist @entity66 has written about teens who systematically delete every post they make on @entity25 soon after they make it			1
apps such as @entity5 just automate the process			1
and it turns out there 's a huge market in that			1
social media users migrating to smaller circles ephemeral conversation is easy to promise but hard to get right			1
in 2013 , researchers discovered that @entity4 does n't delete images as advertised ; it merely changes their names so they 're not easy to see			1
whether this is a problem for users depends on how technically savvy their adversaries are , but it illustrates the difficulty of making instant deletion actually work			0
the problem is that these new " ephemeral " conversations are n't really ephemeral the way a face - to - face unrecorded conversation would be			1
they 're not ephemeral like a conversation during a walk in a deserted woods used to be before the invention of cell phones and gps receivers			2
at best , the data is recorded , used , saved and then deliberately deleted			0
at worst , the ephemeral nature is faked			2
while the apps make the posts , texts or messages unavailable to users quickly , they probably do n't erase them off their systems immediately			2
they certainly do n't erase them from their backup tapes , if they end up there			0
the companies offering these apps might very well analyze their content and make that information available to advertisers			1
we do n't know how much metadata is saved			0
in @entity4 , users can see the metadata even though they ca n't see the content and what it 's used for			1
and if the government demanded copies of those conversations -- either through a secret @entity125 demand or a more normal legal process involving an employer or school -- the companies would have no choice but to hand them over			2
even worse , if the @entity132 or @entity125 demanded that @entity134 companies secretly store those conversations and not tell their users , breaking their promise of deletion , the companies would have no choice but to comply			2
that last bit is n't just paranoia			0
we know the @entity134 government has done this to companies large and small			2
@entity146 was a small secure e-mail service , with an encryption system designed so that even the company had no access to users ' e-mail			2
last year , the @entity125 presented it with a secret court order demanding that it turn over its master key , thereby compromising the security of every user			0
@entity146 shut down its service rather than comply , but that option is n't feasible for larger companies			2
in 2011 , @entity161 made some still - unknown changes to @entity163 to make @entity125 eavesdropping easier , but the security promises they advertised did n't change			0
this is one of the reasons president @entity168 's announcement that he will end one particular @entity125 collection program under one particular legal authority barely begins to solve the problem : the surveillance state is so robust that anything other than a major overhaul wo n't make a difference			2
of course , the typical @entity4 user does n't care whether the @entity134 government is monitoring his conversations			1
he 's more concerned about his high school friends and his parents			0
but if these platforms are insecure , it 's not just the @entity125 that one should worry about			0
dissidents in the @entity183 and elsewhere need security , and if they rely on ephemeral apps , they need to know that their own governments are n't saving copies of their chats			1
and even @entity134 high school students need to know that their photos wo n't be surreptitiously saved and used against them years later			0
the need for ephemeral conversation is n't some weird privacy fetish or the exclusive purview of criminals with something to hide			0
it represents a basic need for human privacy , and something every one of us had as a matter of course before the invention of microphones and recording devices			0
we need ephemeral apps , but we need credible assurances from the companies that they are actually secure and credible assurances from the government that they wo n't be subverted			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			1

@entity213 : ephemeral messaging apps such as @entity4 are on the rise
@entity213 : these apps claim they permanently delete your post , but that 's not quite true
he says the app companies might analyze their content and give info to advertisers
@entity213 : if the apps are not truly secure , dissidents who use them could be *affected*
