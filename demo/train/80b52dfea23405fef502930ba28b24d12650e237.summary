when a famous musician dies that loss is usually felt more widely than most			2
in my case though , the death of one particular musician this year was a moment of keen significance , because i literally owe my life to @entity9 , and his older brother @entity10			1
my parents were born into the austerity of south - east @entity14 , as @entity16 and its surrounding areas recovered from @entity18 not long after my mother had started school , my grandparents decided to leave the difficulties of post-war @entity16 behind them and move out to the @entity22 countryside bordering the city to its east			1
my father 's family , also @entity27 , had made the move some years earlier			2
my grandfather , who served in the @entity30 in @entity31 and @entity32 during the war , returned to work in one of the many oil refineries dotted along the @entity36			2
my mother was 14 when she met my then 16 - year - old father			2
the early ' 60s may have been swinging in central @entity16 , but the decade 's influence was less obvious in the suburbs			2
my parents ' first encounter , in 1962 , was a model of chaste restraint , at a village dance where boys and girls were kept under the careful watch of adults ( especially during any slow dancing			1
) my dad walked my mum home , and assures me that nothing untoward took place			2
by this time the @entity9 ' powers had already peaked , but their influence on my father was still growing			1
his first encounter with their silken harmonies actually came in 1958 , huddled under blankets at his aunt 's draughty house			2
there he would listen to the sounds of one of rock ' n roll 's pioneering platforms , @entity71			2
" @entity72 " played through the speakers of the wireless , as radios were always called back then , and he was hooked			2
my mum and dad dated happily for a couple of years , but in 1964 they hit a blip			2
on a chilly night , the couple were walking back from a dance at their local college hall			2
@entity85 and the @entity86 had been playing			0
at the bus stop , my mum told my dad that she no longer wanted to be his girlfriend			0
powerless to change her mind , he waved her goodbye for what might have been the last time			0
like @entity93 in @entity94 , my life was fading from the picture			1
the @entity9 , too , were on the wane			1
but their sound was underpinning many of the tracks that were now piloting bands to superstardom			0
@entity102 may have been a new sound , but it owed a heavy debt to its forebears			0
listen to " @entity106 " by the @entity107 , and compare it to " @entity108 " by the @entity109 ( the first record to top both the @entity110 and @entity112 charts at the same time , ) and it is hard not to notice the similarities			1
in a bid to win back my mother 's affections , my dad hit upon an idea			0
he headed to his local record store and bought a copy of " @entity121 ( to watch @entity122 )			0
" he passed it to my mum 's brother , with whom he was good friends			1
it was a classic inside job : the man who is now my uncle passed it to the woman who would become my mum ; she played it on the family 's gramophone , and -- in the words of @entity135 -- the spell was cast			0
my parents met again , and were reconciled			1
they did n't know it at the time , but i too was saved			0
my dad 's affection for the @entity9 never faded			1
he kept pace with disco , listened to the new romantics of the ' 80s , had a brush with reggae , and even dabbled in house music			0
but all of these would be punctuated by the @entity9 ' gentle voices			1
the @entity151 split acrimoniously in 1973 , with @entity152 famously smashing his guitar and storming off stage			1
but they reformed for a special @entity156 at @entity16 's @entity157 in 1983			0
inevitably , my dad was there -- with my mum by his side			0
two years later , he insisted on taking me and my sister , aged 12 and 10 , to @entity16 's @entity162 to see the @entity109 for ourselves			1
we were sat near the front , and the aging but still potent duo won me and my equally cynical sister over completely			1
at the end of the concert my dad lifted my sister onto his shoulders and @entity10 shook her hand			1
my dad actually had a couple of encounters with @entity9 years later , while working in @entity174			1
he was shopping at @entity175 in @entity176 when he saw @entity152 and his then girlfriend @entity177 buying groceries			0
star - struck and too polite to approach them , he did n't take his chance to say hello			0
however , not long after , he found himself dining in a @entity183 restaurant on the next table to the couple			0
this time he made his move , and was able to finally meet his idol -- who was impeccably warm and polite			0
sadly , in his excitement , my dad forgot to tell him about the record			0
in january this year , as news broke that pulmonary disease had claimed @entity152 's life , my brother - in - law called my parents ' house to check if they had heard			1
my mum broke the news to my dad , who sat down and cried inconsolably			0
throughout the week he received calls from friends and family , all checking to see how he 'd reacted to the news			0
it was as if a family member had died , and in a way -- for my dad at least -- that was what @entity152 and @entity207 were and are			1
for my own part , the news was a reminder of the comforting soundtrack of my youngest years ; of car journeys to the coast , lazy sunday mornings , family gatherings and parties			0
above all though , it was a reminder of the story of my parents ' near break up , their reconciliation , and the debt i owe @entity152 and his brother			1
so thank you , @entity9 , and may you rest in peace			1
