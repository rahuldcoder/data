-- @entity2 rebels released a top military general and two other hostages sunday in a move that could allow stalled peace talks to resume			1
gen. @entity9 , who commands a 2,500 - soldier counterinsurgency group and previously headed the @entity2 army 's anti-kidnapping unit , was among the hostages handed over to mediators in a rural area in western @entity2 , the @entity8 said			1
the released hostages are " in perfect condition , " @entity2 president @entity16 said in a @entity20 post sunday			2
@entity2 's @entity21 said they were being transported to the country 's capital sunday evening to reunite with their families and undergo medical checkups after 14 days in captivity			1
local media reported that @entity9 was the highest - ranking officer to be taken prisoner by guerrillas from the @entity32 during the country 's bloody , five - decades - old civil war			2
the high - profile capture two weeks ago sent the peace talks in @entity37 between the government and the rebels , who are known as the @entity32 , screeching to a halt			1
@entity2 president @entity16 suspended the peace talks , demanded @entity9 's release and called on the country 's military to investigate why the general had apparently broken protocol by venturing into rebel territory			1
@entity9 was traveling by a boat along a river in an area known to be a hub for drug smugglers and rebels when he , an @entity57 lawyer and a corporal were captured , @entity2 government officials said			2
a second soldier traveling with the group managed to escape and told officials that @entity9 and his companions had been in the area to inspect an energy project			0
but @entity32 leaders told reporters in @entity37 earlier this month that no such project exists in that area and that they were baffled by @entity9 's presence there			2
rebels released @entity9 , the corporal and the army lawyer sunday to representatives of the @entity75 and @entity76 governments and the @entity77			0
they were transported via helicopter to @entity79 , where they were handed over to the @entity2 army , the @entity77 said			0
on @entity20 , @entity2 's @entity21 posted a photo of the three freed hostages meeting with the defense minister and other military leaders			1
the @entity87 government has provided @entity2 's military with billions of dollars in training and aid to battle @entity32 guerrillas , who authorities accuse of massive - scale drug trafficking to finance their insurgency			1
at the beginning of the peace talks in 2012 , @entity32 leaders said they had released all their prisoners and hostages as a sign of good faith			1
but president @entity16 has resisted their offers of a ceasefire , saying a previous armistice allowed rebels to seize large swathes of territory			0
@entity16 said in a statement that he would be meeting with his government 's negotiators to discuss the terms of their return to @entity37			0
the release of the hostages sunday , he said , " contributed to restoring a climate conducive to continuing the talks , demonstrates the maturity of the process and permits us to unite our voice to those of millions of @entity2 who express their solidarity with those freed			2
" the rebels renewed their calls for a ceasefire in a written statement released sunday , saying the guerrilla group must now " redesign the rules of the game			0
" " it is time for a bilateral ceasefire , an armistice , so that no bellicose event on the battlefield can be used to justify the interruption of such beautiful and historic work as it is to agree on peace for a nation that longs for this destiny , " the @entity32 said			0
after the hostages ' release , a @entity77 official said he hoped the peace talks would start up again			0
" we hope that the peace talks between the @entity2 government and the @entity32 will resume soon , " @entity146 , who heads the @entity77 delegation in @entity2 , said in a statement			1
" we continue to support this process , with a view to alleviating the suffering of all the victims of this long conflict			0
