-- @entity1 just purchased a service for sharing your location with friends , according to a @entity7 report			1
@entity8 2:30 p.m. et : @entity9 has confirmed in a blog post that its service will wind down by the end of january			2
so what does that mean to those of us who use @entity1 or @entity9 ? if you 're a @entity9 user and love the service the way it is , it 's almost certainly bad news			1
when @entity1 acquires a company , it rarely keeps the original product intact			2
instead , it voraciously devours these smaller startups to get to the talented developers housed within			0
@entity27 , a recent acquisition , is in the process of shutting down while @entity1 works instead on @entity30 , a similar service			2
the initial report suggests this will be the case with @entity9 : some of the @entity35 - based team will move to @entity36 , @entity37 , to work at @entity1 , while a few will stay behind in @entity35			1
the move also technically means that @entity1 owns the data you entered into @entity9			1
i 'd bet against @entity1 importing this information into your @entity1 profile without your consent -- they 're likely aware that this would result in another privacy scare -- but i do think @entity1 will provide time to export your @entity9 data if they do shut it down			1
why is this a likely outcome ? because it 's exactly what they 're doing with @entity27			2
existing users can download an archive of their @entity27 messages until mid-december			0
who knows , they might even provide a way to add your @entity9 check - ins to your @entity61 -- but only with consent			2
what about @entity1 users ? is anything likely to change ? one conclusion you could naturally jump to is that @entity1 wants you to share your location more often -- and the @entity9 team will build features into @entity1 to do so			1
this would be logical : @entity1 already launched a product , @entity73 , for doing just that -- but they later scaled it back and merged the features into your status updates			0
maybe @entity1 wants to take another shot ? to some extent , perhaps			0
my guess is that the integration wo n't be completely literal			0
i do n't foresee @entity1 providing " stamps " for checking in to certain locations , for instance			0
i do n't think it will generate city guides for major metropolitan areas , either			0
we know from the initial report that @entity9 employees will work on @entity89 , @entity1 's new scrapbook - like layout , and i 'd guess that their skills will be used more generally , rather than working solely on location - based features			1
we also know that a source with knowledge of the deal thinks that there 's a broader similarity between the two companies			0
" @entity9 's vision is about people telling stories , and @entity1 's vision for @entity106 is about stories about important moments in life , " said the source			1
so do n't expect @entity1 to suddenly launch a wave of new location - based features			0
i think the fusion of the companies will be less visible than that			0
what does all this mean to you ? if you 're a @entity9 user and the deal is confirmed , you may want to switch services			1
i do n't think @entity9 will be around for much longer if this @entity1 deal closes			1
if you 're a @entity1 user , meanwhile , you probably wo n't feel a thing			2
@entity1 just bought another group of talented developers and will continue to dominate the world of social networking for years to come			0
your @entity1 experience may even improve , thanks to the influx of talent into @entity1 's ranks			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity133 .			0

if you 're a @entity9 lover , @entity1 's purchase is almost certainly bad news
@entity1 now owns any data you imported to @entity9
initial report suggests @entity9 employees will work on @entity1 's *timeline* feature
