a debilitating , mosquito - borne virus called chikungunya has made its way to @entity4 , health officials say			1
it 's the state 's first reported case of the virus			1
the patient was likely infected in the @entity9 , according to the @entity11 @entity10			1
@entity12 is primarily found in @entity13 , @entity14 and the @entity9 islands , but the @entity16 has been watching the virus , + for fear that it could take hold in the @entity20 -- much like @entity21 did more than a decade ago			1
the virus , which can cause joint pain and arthritis - like symptoms , has been on the @entity20 public health radar for some time			1
about 25 to 28 infected travelers bring it to the @entity20 each year , said @entity28 , chief of the @entity16 's @entity29 in the @entity30			0
" we have n't had any locally transmitted cases in the @entity20 thus far , " @entity28 said			0
but a major outbreak in the @entity9 this year -- with more than 100,000 cases reported -- has health officials concerned			1
experts say @entity20 tourists are bringing chikungunya back home , and it 's just a matter of time before it starts to spread within the @entity20			2
after all , the @entity9 is a popular one with @entity20 tourists , and summer is fast approaching			1
" so far this year we 've recorded eight travel - associated cases , and seven of them have come from countries in the @entity9 where we know the virus is being transmitted , " @entity28 said			1
other states have also reported cases of chikungunya			2
the @entity52 @entity51 said the state has had multiple cases of the virus in people who have traveled to the @entity9			1
the virus is not deadly , but it can be painful , with symptoms lasting for weeks			1
those with weak immune systems , such as the elderly , are more likely to suffer from the virus ' side effects than those who are healthier			2
the good news , said dr. @entity67 , an infectious disease expert with @entity69 in @entity70 , is that the @entity20 is more sophisticated when it comes to controlling mosquitoes than many other nations			0
" we live in a largely air - conditioned environment , and we have a lot of screening ( window screens , porch screens ) , " @entity67 said			2
" so we can separate the humans from the mosquito population , but we can not be completely be isolated			0
" @entity12 was originally identified in @entity13 in the 1950s			1
the ecological makeup of the @entity20 supports the spread of an illness such as this , especially in the tropical areas of @entity86 and other @entity88 states , according to the @entity16			0
the other concern is the type of mosquito that carries the illness			0
unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn , the chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by @entity96 and @entity98 albopictus mosquitoes			2
these are the same mosquitoes that transmit the virus that causes dengue fever			0
they bite mostly during the daytime			0
the disease is transmitted from mosquito to human , human to mosquito and so forth			0
a female mosquito of this type lives three to four weeks and can bite someone every three to four days			2
@entity67 and other health experts recommend people remember the mosquito - control basics : use bug spray if you are going out , especially in tropical , or wooded areas near water			1
get rid of standing water , empty plastic pools , flower pots and pet dishes , so mosquitoes do n't breed			0
dress appropriately , with long sleeves and pants			0
will dengue fever threaten the @entity128 ?			0
