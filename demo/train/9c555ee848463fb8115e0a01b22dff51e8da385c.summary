@entity0 -- five @entity4 employees have been placed on administrative leave after a sensitive airport security manual was posted on the @entity7 , the agency announced wednesday			1
the @entity4 said the version of the manual that ended up online was several editions old and did not expose the agency 's current airport screening protocols			1
and homeland security secretary @entity13 told a @entity15 committee wednesday that " the security of the traveling public has never been put at risk			1
" the manual outlined screening procedures for law enforcement officers , diplomats , prisoners , federal air marshals and others			1
@entity26 told the @entity27 that action had been taken against a contractor and some @entity4 supervisors			1
the agency has instituted an internal review of the incident " to see what else needs to be done so that the incident never recurs , " she said , and the @entity35 has asked its inspector general to conduct an independent review " to make sure that we are being rigorous and very disciplined on what is posted and what is not			2
" sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , suggested to @entity26 that a " red team " damage assessment be done -- a review by someone outside the agency to determine what advantage a potential enemy could have gained from the information and recommend what procedures or actions are necessary to minimize the damage			2
@entity26 said the agency is considering it			0
" i think one of my first questions has been , well , what exactly was put out there that was n't available either by observation of airport checkpoints or the like , " she said			0
" but indeed , we may , if it is ascertained that there was some information not otherwise available that was put out , i think the red teaming issue is something that i would consider , absolutely			0
" @entity43 replied that " just from public reports , there are clearly some things you do n't want out there , spelling out the settings on the x-ray machines and explosive detectors , passenger and luggage screening details , pictures of credentials that are authorized , those kind of things			1
clearly , somebody could take advantage of those things			0
" the 93 - page instruction manual was written for airport screeners , providing details on how screening is conducted and the limitations of x-ray machines			1
it was posted on a web site for government contractors , with sensitive parts redacted -- but the redacted information was not properly protected , and the information was restored by people familiar with the computer program			0
the manual was dated may 2008 , but the @entity4 said it was never implemented and has been revised six times , although it did not elaborate on the extent of the revisions			1
it said the report was removed as soon as it learned of the problem , but the full , unredacted version of the report appeared on at least one web site sunday and was distributed more widely tuesday			0
two @entity4 officials told the @entity115 that the practice of posting sensitive documents has been suspended for the time being			1
@entity124 , under secretary for the @entity120 at the @entity35 , and @entity121 , the agency 's assistant secretary for policy , appeared before the committee and faced tough questions from its ranking @entity127 , sen. @entity129 of @entity130			2
@entity124 pointed out to @entity131 that the manual was for supervisors , not front - line screeners			2
" the actual screening procedures that a @entity136 , a transportation security officer , would actually use at a screening point are not in that document , " he said			2
@entity131 , however , noted that the manual has a whole section on credentials , including those used by members of the @entity145 , the @entity146 and the @entity147			0
" i would say to my colleagues that there 's a page with a picture of what an id for a @entity154 senator looks like , and ironically , in the airport this weekend , i had the screener look at my @entity152 and check the manual , " @entity131 said			0
" so this is important , if we 're talking about making sure that the people who would do us harm do n't have the ability to falsify documents , we 've given them a textbook on how to do so in this manual because we 've showed them exactly what documents look like for individuals who are likely to receive less screening because they have these documents , because they are law enforcement officials , for example			1
" she asked if the @entity4 had notified those agencies that such information was included in the manual			1
@entity121 told her that such notifications had been made			0
@entity131 told the committee that she did not believe she was revealing anything " that is n't already out			0
" and @entity131 aide @entity184 said the senator believed @entity26 was trying to play down the seriousness of the breach and that her examples would drive home that point			0
@entity1 's @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

" the security of the traveling public has never been put at risk , " security chief says
she 's considering review by outside agency ; @entity4 says online manual was several editions old

officials say the practice of posting sensitive documents has been suspended
