beleaguered @entity1 mayoral candidate @entity0 got into a war of words wednesday with a man who lashed out at him for being " married to an @entity5 , " in addition to chastising the former congressman about his well - documented sexting scandal			1
the incident began inside a bakery in @entity13 's @entity12 neighborhood , where the man yelled out to @entity0 , who had just bought cookies and an iced coffee , " you 're a real scumbag			1
" @entity0 offered a quick retort , then said to no one in particular , " very nice , that 's a charming guy right there			2
" it 's then that the man , later identified as @entity24 , responded : " married to an @entity5			1
" the comment is an apparent reference to @entity0 's wife , @entity27 , who works for @entity28			2
@entity27 's late father was an @entity30 scholar from @entity31 and her mother , a sociologist , is from @entity33			0
@entity0 is @entity34 , as were most of those inside the @entity13 bakery			1
@entity27 emerges , stands by her husband the @entity39 candidate responded with , " very nice , in front of children ... that is charming			0
" @entity24 did n't stop talking , even as @entity0 was leaving the bakery , saying , " you are disgusting , disgusting			1
" " it takes one to know one , jackass , " @entity0 replied			1
the two then went face - to - face , with @entity24 accusing @entity0 -- who resigned in disgrace after 12 years in @entity48 representing part of @entity1 after admitting to sending sexually suggestive images and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women over the @entity53 -- of doing " disgusting things , and you have the nerve to even walk around in public			1
" a visibly agitated @entity0 responded , " and you 're a perfect person ? you 're my judge ? what rabbi taught you that ? " at one point , @entity24 implored @entity0 to " think about your wife , how could you take the person you 're most closest to ... and betray her ? " the mayoral hopeful then accused @entity24 of acting like he is superior , even though he does n't " have the moral authority to judge me			1
" @entity0 : hate media ? love me the back - and - forth went on for about a minute longer before @entity0 left the bakery			1
he seemed to quickly brush off the confrontation , saying , " he has every right to ( challenge me )			0
" the @entity0 campaign released a video of wednesday 's exchange , a version of which also was captured by blogger @entity81			2
talking with reporters later in the day , @entity0 described what happened as " just some enthusiastic exchange with a voter			2
" " look , you 're allowed to say stuff to me , " said @entity0 , who , according to a @entity87 poll released tuesday , trails three other @entity39 candidates ahead of next week 's primary			2
" but if you 're going to say vile things about me and my family , you should expect that i 'm going to go back at you			1
" hecklers do n't get a chance to necessarily get the last word if they cross the line			0
" reached by @entity98 later in the day , @entity24 admitted calling out @entity0 for being " married to an @entity5			1
" " it 's just a certain feeling i have as a jew , " said the 51 - year - old real estate manager , explaining his remark			0
" and my attitude is that -- not all @entity5 -- but , in general , ... they want to kill every @entity34			1
" @entity24 said of a @entity34 person marrying into such a family : " it 's like a betrayal			2
" @entity24 also said @entity0 has bothered him for some time			0
@entity24 called him a " phony			0
" but @entity24 said he should have acted differently			0
" ( given that i felt ) a little bit of anger , i probably should n't have said it , " @entity24 said about the @entity5 comment			0
" i should n't have called him a scumbag			0
" " but it was in the heat of the moment			0
" is @entity27 blaming herself ?			0
