on january 10 , in my weekly @entity2 , i wrote about an online fundraiser called the @entity5 where , essentially , four guys were trying to quickly raise $ 25,000 for charity to more - or-less guilt - trip the @entity10 company into flying their blimp high in the air while spelling out in lights " @entity14 's a pimp			1
" if @entity10 would do this on january 20 -- a very specific and important date -- the @entity19 nonprofit , @entity20 , would get the money			1
you know , for kids ! but it had to be that date and @entity27 words			0
it 's a little silly and a lot complicated , and you can read the whole backstory here , but just know that it all stems from the lyrics of one of @entity14 's old - school , 1992 hit rap songs " @entity36 " where , in recounting a day so good he " even saw the lights of the @entity10 and it read @entity14 's a pimp			1
" for my column , i actually spoke to @entity14 while he happened to be at the @entity41 in @entity42 promoting his new movie " @entity45 , " ( sequel to come , he told @entity46 today ) and that 's when he first learned of the movement			1
he thought it was : " dope			0
" then , a few days later he acknowledged the movement on @entity52 before appearing on @entity53 with @entity54 where the subject once again came up			0
so , between us and @entity54 , we feel a little responsible for this thing blowing up			0
what was once a quiet , ridiculous internet fundraiser was now officially a thing			0
@entity10 released a statement via @entity52 , saying that on january 20 they would treat kids from the @entity64 charity to rides on the blimp , and even invited @entity14 to join them			1
however , they were n't going to write " @entity14 's a pimp			1
" that just was n't going to happen			0
but they basically met everyone halfway by promising to write out " it 's a good day			2
" in the end , @entity14 flew out to @entity19 early monday morning from the @entity72 to meet with the kids , check out the blimp , and help the @entity5 guys present a large , novelty - sized $ 25,000 check to the charity			1
" i never thought in a million years it would happen , " @entity14 said , standing outside the blimp			1
" rap is a mixture of fantasy and reality , and it seems like fantasy has met reality today			0
the wording was n't exact , but let 's face it , @entity10 was never going to write @entity15 on their famous airship , and they very easily could have ignored the whole thing			2
by january 21 it would be a memory			2
and credit to @entity14 for being there for the festivities			2
it was a good day			0
follow @ @entity98 on @entity52 .			0

@entity14 wrote the 1992 hit song " @entity36 "
in it , he describes his *version* of a *perfect* day in @entity19 , @entity19
one of the *examples* was having his name in lights on the @entity10
his dream was realized on january 20 , 2014
