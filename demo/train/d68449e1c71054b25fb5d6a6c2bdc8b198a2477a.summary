@entity0 -- @entity4 prime minister @entity3 is asking lawmakers to withdraw confidence from his deputy after @entity8 made controversial comments this week over @entity11 forces withdrawing from @entity4 , state media reported late saturday			1
in a recent interview with @entity1 , @entity8 accused @entity3 of amassing dictatorial power			1
" there will be a day whereby the @entity11 will realize that they were deceived by @entity3 ... and they will regret that , " said @entity8 , a leader within @entity15 movement			1
the request followed word that the @entity15 coalition was boycotting the country 's parliament -- a move that would threaten @entity4 's fragile power - sharing arrangement			1
the crisis pits @entity3 , a @entity26 , against @entity15 , a powerful political bloc that enjoys support from @entity28 and more secular @entity4			1
also at issue were reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for vice president @entity32 for masterminding a recent car bombing targeting the parliament			1
@entity35 , @entity3 's media adviser , said there were confessions that linked the @entity28 vice president to the bombing			1
@entity40 dismissed the notion that linking @entity32 to terrorism was politically motivated			0
he would not confirm whether an arrest warrant had indeed been issued , saying that was a matter for the judiciary			0
the @entity15 bloc , headed by former prime minister @entity47 , made its move friday night			1
the bloc is one of the largest and most powerful political groups in @entity4 and boasts among its members the speaker of the parliament			2
the bloc had been in a power - sharing deal with @entity3 's @entity57 , backed mostly by @entity26			1
@entity15 accuses @entity3 of trying to consolidate his own power rather than share it			1
his rivals say , for example , that he still controls the country 's security ministries and all decisions go through him			0
they also say that the hundreds of people seized by the government in october for backing terrorism and supporting the banned @entity68 are @entity15 supporters			2
iraqiya spokesman @entity70 said the bloc has always warned about the deal 's risks and says the @entity57 has been violating the law			2
" @entity15 has always expressed its rejection to the policy of exclusion and marginalization , lack of power sharing , politicization of the judiciary , the lack of balance within the government institutions , " @entity70 said			2
@entity3 won a second term as prime minister in 2010 after a months - long dispute among the leading parties in the country 's parliamentary elections			1
the largely secular @entity15 movement won two more seats than @entity3 's party , but a merger of the premier 's @entity26 slate with a smaller @entity26 bloc put him first in line to form a government			1
there had been fears of renewed bloodshed between @entity4 's majority @entity26 and minority @entity28 populations and that prompted @entity11 officials to work out a power - sharing agreement , bringing the @entity15 movement into the government			1
@entity112 told @entity1 that @entity113 is leaving @entity4 " with a dictator " who has ignored a power - sharing agreement , kept control of the country 's security forces and rounded up hundreds of people in recent weeks			2
he said he was " shocked " to hear @entity11 president @entity121 greet @entity3 at the @entity122 on monday as " the elected leader of a sovereign , self - reliant and democratic @entity4			2
" " @entity11 left @entity4 with almost no infrastructure			0
the political process is going in a very wrong direction , going toward a dictatorship , " he said			0
" people are not going to accept that , and most likely they are going to ask for the division of the country			0
and this is going to be a disaster			0
dividing the country is n't going to be smooth , because dividing the country is going to be a war before that and a war after that			0
" neighboring @entity140 , predominantly @entity26 and led by a @entity26 regime , views @entity3 as its man in @entity0 and has dictated the shape of the current government , @entity8 said			1
but he said @entity3 is playing games with both @entity113 and @entity146			0
the last @entity11 troops are scheduled to be out of @entity4 by the end of december , nearly nine years after the 2003 invasion that topped @entity150			0
more than 4,000 @entity11 and an estimated 115,000 @entity4 died in the invasion and the years of insurgency and sectarian warfare that followed			0
a sunni who was originally barred from running because of allegations that he supported @entity150 's @entity68 , @entity8 said he has no authority within the government			2
he said @entity3 has flouted the power - sharing deal 's provisions by refusing to name permanent ministers to lead the defense and interior ministries , which concentrates control over the military and police in the prime minister 's hands			1
he said @entity11 officials , who brokered the power - sharing deal , either " do n't know anything in @entity4 and they do n't know what is happening in @entity4 , or because they do n't want to admit the reality in @entity4 , the failure in @entity4 , the failure of this political process that they set in @entity4			0
" along with @entity26 and @entity28 , @entity180 are a major player in @entity4 politics			0
@entity183 , a @entity184 member of parliament , said lawmakers discussed the @entity15 move on saturday and said it reflects " a level of mistrust between the blocs , the government , @entity15 and others			1
" the problem is that @entity3 is n't sharing any security decisions with @entity15 , he does n't trust them and this is a big problem , " he said			1
" power - sharing was never power - sharing			0
we are in a government of conflict			0
power - sharing was never successful			0
" the @entity180 do n't want to take sides , we want them ( @entity15 and @entity202 ) to get together to solve their problems			2
" he is worried that the problem could morph into fighting between @entity28 and @entity26 or violence against the government			0
" this is n't just political , " he said			0
