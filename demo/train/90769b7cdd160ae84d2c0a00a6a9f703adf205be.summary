@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 service is underway at the @entity5 in the @entity7 suburb of @entity1 's federal capital territory			1
fourteen year - old @entity9 heads there with his family			0
they walk alongside stray goats on a road covered in red dust and potholes , lined with open sewage			0
they are nearly 20 kilometers away from the modern multi-story office buildings and sprawling mansions in @entity1 's capital city of @entity0			2
about 50 people gather in the synagogue			0
they pray from the @entity24 , they read from the @entity25 and as they chant , @entity9 's mellow alto begins to rise			0
in a country of 162 million people tensions often lead to violent uprisings between @entity31 and @entity32 and being part of the religious minority can be an issue			0
but @entity9 wears his kippah and his identity with pride			0
" i am a @entity40 @entity39 , " he says			1
the @entity39 are one of @entity1 's largest ethnic groups with population estimates ranging from 20 to 50 million			1
@entity9 is convinced that the @entity39 's ancestors were @entity45			1
" the son of @entity47 , @entity47 , [ was ] @entity48 and i learned that he was among those people who went out of @entity50 to exile , " @entity9 says			1
" so from there he had a son called @entity54 and a son gave birth to a son called @entity58 and that 's how the @entity39 race began			2
" from generation to generation , some @entity39 have passed down various versions of a migration story framed around @entity47 , a patriarch of @entity65			2
a popular version of the narrative holds that @entity48 , the seventh son of @entity47 , had three sons who settled in present - day southeastern @entity1 , which is predominantly inhabited by the @entity39			1
those sons , @entity54 , @entity70 and @entity71 ( as mentioned in the book of @entity73 ) , are said to have fathered clans , established kingdoms and founded towns still in existence in southeastern @entity1 today , including @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity58			2

wearing a white shirt with the @entity90 stitched on the front , @entity88 points to a calendar on the wall of his palace that lists the names of his 33 predecessors			0
he has no doubts that @entity54 is his ancestor			0
he has even acquired land to establish an educational center for the study of @entity40 culture			2
" israelites and @entity39 are brothers , " he says with a broad smile			2
@entity88 , like many , claims that the @entity39 are the @entity106			2
they believe they are descendants of at least one of @entity50 's lost tribes			1
in the eighth century @entity111 the @entity110 invaded @entity50 's northern kingdom forcing 10 tribes into exile			1
historians say it is not unlikely that these tribes migrated westward to @entity118			0
throughout history , large populations of dispersed @entity45 also became " lost " through forced conversions and cultural assimilation			1
" there is evidence that is scientific that the @entity39 descended from the people that evolved in @entity50 , " says @entity123			1
he began investigating the stories from his youth more than a decade ago			0
" when i grew up i heard , like virtually every @entity39 here , that the @entity39 people came from @entity50 , " the @entity0 - based lawyer says			1
his field work in @entity1 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 led him to conclude that @entity39 and @entity40 culture are not just similar , but " identical			1
" in his latest book , @entity137 draws parallels between @entity39 rituals and customs and those practiced by @entity45			1
shared traditional practices include circumcising male children eight days after birth , refraining from eating " unclean " or tabooed foods , mourning the dead for seven days , celebrating the @entity148 and conducting wedding ceremonies under a canopy			0
some historians have noted that the @entity39 were practicing these customs before their exposure to the @entity153 and missionaries			1
@entity155 , from the @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , is one of the foremost researchers on @entity40 identification among the @entity39			1
he says there has been a clear continuity of @entity40 identity among the @entity39			1
" it 's not just something that happened yesterday , " he says			0
the @entity158 - @entity50 anthropologist says that @entity39 - @entity40 identity can be traced back to the 18th century			1
cross-cultural comparisons have been documented by people ranging from @entity169 , the influential @entity170 missionary and ethnographer who proposed that the word " @entity39 " evolved as a corruption of the word " @entity175 , " to @entity176 , a freed @entity39 slave living in 18th century @entity178 society			1
the oral stories and historic notations of cultural resemblances between the @entity39 and the @entity45 have proven compelling enough to lure a diverse array of people to southeastern @entity1			1

" i 've read about them but of course there is nothing like actually hearing the stories of the people themselves , " he says			0
discovering " lost " @entity40 communities around the world is what @entity185 does			1
he is the founder and chairman of the independent non-profit organization @entity185			0
according to its media spokesperson @entity200 , @entity185 is the only organization in @entity50 that focuses on finding descendants of the legendary lost tribes			1
he says the @entity50 government does not recognize ethnic communities in various countries claiming to be descendants of lost tribes			1
" they can not prove that they have a @entity40 grandfather or grandmother , " @entity200 says			2
" but they do have an interesting story			0
" @entity185 says he has received numerous letters and emails from @entity1 trying to connect to @entity50			1
but with a rising number of groups around the world attempting to link their ancestry to the @entity219 , he is aware that some of those claims are " wishful thinking			2
" he hopes that the future will yield strong genetic evidence to help the search for the lost tribes			1
" as dna technology improves there will be a growing stock of scientific evidence which can perhaps buttress the claims of an @entity50 ancestry , " he says			2
a 2012 documentary called " re-emerging : the @entity45 " featured the country 's jewish community			2
the film featured rabbi @entity237			0
he retired from the congressional rabbinate in 2012 after 32 years as the spiritual leader of a @entity40 congregation in the @entity186 state of @entity242			2

" i embrace them and support them as brothers and sisters , " he says			0
he ships books on @entity65 to synagogues in @entity1			0
watch video : @entity255 megacity more support comes from groups like @entity258 , a @entity259 - based non-profit group			0
@entity258 assists emerging @entity40 communities around the world , like the one in @entity1			1
but most of the @entity39 who practice @entity65 were not born to a @entity40 mother and have not converted according to halakhah , @entity40 law , so many @entity266 would not recognize them			1
even among @entity39 people , the claim to be @entity45 elicits strong criticism			1
one critic , @entity270 , attributes @entity40 identification among the @entity39 as a result of @entity273 brought by missionaries , since most igbo people are @entity31			1
" everybody is excited to say they belong to the people of the @entity153 because the @entity153 is reigning -- it 's in , " says @entity270 , a prominent researcher on @entity39 history and culture			2
in her award - winning book " they lived before @entity285 " @entity270 proposes that @entity39 civilization is older than that of the @entity219			1
she feels that igbo people are whitewashing their history and diminishing the value of their own culture by attempting to link their heritage to the @entity45			2
@entity291 , who says he is a " proud @entity39 man , " strongly disagrees			0
he started practicing @entity65 in 1991 after leaving the methodist church			0
he says that the more he followed the commandments in the @entity25 , the more he realized that he was doing what his parents had always done as followers of traditional @entity39 culture and spirituality			0
" i have seen that the traditions of our people are similar to those in the @entity153 , " says the 66 - year - old , making references to aspects like ritual bathing and polygamy			0
@entity291 is one of the founders of the @entity5 synagogue			0
he plays an important role as a spiritual leader in @entity0 's community of @entity45			0
he attended @entity9 's bar mitzvah last year , an experience that @entity9 says made him feel like a man , and feel closer to the @entity40 culture			0
he wants to go deeper into @entity266 and take a pilgrimage to the @entity318			0
" i want to live in @entity50 , " @entity9 says			0
he hopes that there , he will get a better understanding of his forefathers .			0

among the @entity39 people of @entity1 exists a small group of practicing @entity45
jewish @entity39 believe they are descendants of ' lost tribes ' of @entity50 who settled in @entity1
some draw many parallels between @entity40 and @entity39 customs
others claim @entity39 civilization is older than that of the @entity219
