to some , they 're the gut - wrenching emotional cries of a man whose stepson 's life was taken			2
others say they were dangerous words that sparked a powder keg as violent protests broke out in @entity8 , @entity9 last week			1
but did @entity11 's stepfather intend to incite rioting in the @entity14 suburb ? that 's a question @entity8 police say they 're looking into			1
@entity11 's stepfather did n't hold back as news of a grand jury 's decision not to indict officer @entity21 reached @entity8			1
as throngs in front of the @entity25 listened to @entity14 prosecuting attorney @entity27 's announcement on cell phones and radios , @entity22 stepped onto a platform above the crowd and embraced his wife , @entity11 's mother			1
he then turned to the demonstrators -- some of them shouting " f --- the police ! " -- and yelled , " burn this motherf --- er down ! " and " burn this bitch down ! " his comments drew widespread attention in the aftermath of the violence as a video of his reaction , recorded just after @entity27 's announcement , circulated online			1
no charges have been filed against @entity22 , but police have interviewed people who know @entity22 and who were with him november 24 , the day a prosecutor announced that @entity21 would not be indicted in the august 9 shooting , police chief @entity46 said tuesday			1
@entity22 is n't being singled out , but he 's one of the people being " looked at as part of an ongoing investigation into the activities surrounding nov 24 pertaining to the rioting , looting and arsons , " @entity8 spokesman @entity53 said			1
@entity11 's mother has defended her husband 's reaction			2
last week , @entity63 's @entity62 asked her about accusations that her husband 's words single - handedly started rioting and fires			1
" i say that that 's impossible , " @entity69 said			2
" these things have been going on since august 9th , when it first happened			0
" protests rocked @entity8 that day , hours after @entity21 shot @entity11			1
they grew as time passed and news of the shooting spread			0
when the prosecutor finally revealed the grand jury 's long - awaited decision last week , it was n't long before @entity8 erupted again			1
@entity82 tweeted their first reports of looting less than 15 minutes later			0
in the hours that followed , a row of businesses on @entity86 , a major thoroughfare in the @entity14 suburb , was engulfed in flames			0
police cars and vehicles at a nearby dealership were turned into fireballs			0
there were so many blazes that firefighters could n't reach them all			0
police chief : ' we are pursuing those comments ' police have not spoken to @entity22 about his actions , but they intend to do so , @entity46 said tuesday , adding that multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the investigation			1
the police chief told tv and radio host @entity108 something similar monday , but he did n't classify the probe as formal			0
" we are pursuing those comments , and there 's a lot of discussion going on about that right now , but i really ca n't get into that at this time , " he said			2
but police are n't singling out @entity22 , @entity46 told @entity108			2
" we ca n't let all that happened in @entity8 and @entity118 and the community die			2
everyone who is responsible for taking away people 's property , their livelihoods , their jobs , their businesses -- every single one of them needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , " he said			2
@entity69 , who was standing next to @entity22 when he made the comments and herself told the crowd she 'd never experienced anything like this , offered some context in a @entity63 interview last week			1
after hearing the grand jury 's decision , @entity69 said she felt like she 'd been shot herself and her " emotions were raging			2
" @entity22 was angry , too , she said			1
" he just spoke out of anger			2
it 's one thing to speak , and it 's a different thing to act			2
he just spoke out of anger , " she said			2
" when you 're that hurt and the system has did you this wrong , you may say some things as well			0
we 've all spoke out of anger before			0
" share your view on the @entity8 decision @entity11 family attorney @entity150 has previously called @entity22 's remarks inappropriate but asked the public not to condemn the family for being human			1
more recently , he told @entity63 to remember that @entity11 's mother and father have repeatedly asked protesters to remain peaceful			0
he further called @entity22 's statements " indefensible " and " not appropriate in any way			1
" " we do n't condone people acting on emotion calling for people to do irresponsible things at all , " @entity150 told @entity63			0
" and so we want his family , his mother and father 's message to come across louder than anybody who might be associated with them			0
... and they ca n't control what others do			0
they can control what they pray for			0
" others have called for @entity22 's arrest , including @entity9 lt. gov. @entity178 , who told radio host @entity180 last week " that he should be arrested and charged with inciting to riot			1
" would prosecutors pursue charges ? @entity82 also said tuesday that they were looking into @entity22 's comments			1
police will present their investigation to prosecutors once its complete , police spokesman @entity189 said			0
but is it a case prosecutors would pursue ? it 's unlikely , @entity63 law enforcement analyst @entity194 said			0
" i think they 'll have a hard time proving that somebody that heard him in the midst of all that noise actually went over and did an arson or committed an act of starting a fire			0
i think most of the people you see in the crowd are not watching @entity63			0
they 're not watching media reporting of him saying that , " he told " @entity213			0
" " so it is probably very few people that heard it at that time			0
" also , @entity194 said , it 's likely many people who 'd gathered in @entity8 as the grand jury 's decision was announced were already determined to act			1
" i think the cause and effect of his words will be hard to prove , " @entity194 said			0
@entity62 , a @entity63 legal analyst , said prosecutors should also weigh what impact charging @entity22 could have on the community			2
" i think any prosecutor that looks at a case like this , given what is going on , what has gone on in @entity8 , would never touch this case , " she said			2
" you would have to be really tone deaf to the larger issues that are at play here to bring a case like that			0
" @entity8 police also under investigation more than a week after the grand jury 's decision , investigations into @entity11 's shooting and its aftermath are far from over			1
the @entity248 also is investigating the shooting as part of a civil rights probe -- and investigating the @entity25 , looking at past incidents , procedures and training			0
another part of the probe , according to law enforcement officials , is a pattern of actions by @entity46 , the @entity8 police chief , who critics accuse of inflaming public reactions after @entity11 's shooting			1
among them : the chief 's decision to release a video showing a convenience store robbery in which @entity11 stole cigars minutes before the fatal confrontation with @entity21 , @entity46 's comments to the media that @entity21 would be welcomed back to the police department if a grand jury declined to bring charges , and , now , @entity46 's announcement that his department was investigating @entity22 for possibly inciting a riot			1
@entity21 resigned over the weekend , saying he was worried about putting @entity8 's residents and police officers at risk			1
on tuesday , the @entity283 revealed that its members had been providing the officer with free protection since @entity11 was killed			0
@entity21 began receiving threats via phone , email and social media after the shooting , and " the ( @entity293 ) department being unwilling or unable as an entity to provide security for him , @entity283 members from the surrounding area volunteered and have provided him with security from that time , right up until the present , " said the group 's executive director , @entity301			1
despite @entity306 's assertion that a police department is supposed to protect someone " when a person in the community is inundated with threats on his or her life , " it 's been widely reported that @entity21 went into hiding so hastily after the @entity11 shooting that he left his lawn half - mowed			1
in another development tuesday , @entity9 gov. @entity315 announced that the @entity317 will scale back operations in the area			0
" @entity321 has completed its duties within the city of @entity14 , and has begun to systematically reduce its presence in @entity14 , " @entity315 said in a statement			0
troops are still supporting local law enforcement agencies in @entity8 and other parts of the county , he said			1
