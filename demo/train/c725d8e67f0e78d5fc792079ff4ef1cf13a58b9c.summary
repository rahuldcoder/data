@entity0 , @entity1 -- not too long ago , it seemed this week 's meeting of the @entity5 in @entity1 might be consumed with squabbles about delegate math and anxious hand - wringing over the long and acrimonious presidential primary fight			1
instead , it 's looking more and more like a @entity11 pep rally in the making			1
with @entity11 now on a sure path to the nomination thanks to the departure of his top rival , @entity16 , @entity19 leaders from every state will begin gathering thursday at a posh @entity0 resort to plot out general election strategy with the former @entity24 governor as their standard - bearer			1
@entity11 will address the meeting of state @entity19 chairmen at a friday luncheon that is sure to be the event 's biggest draw			1
later that evening , the presumptive nominee will venture into @entity33 raise money for the joint " @entity35 " he established with the @entity5			2
a minimum donation of $ 50,000 is being requested			0
@entity38 sen. @entity37 of @entity1 will also speak at the three - day conference , an appearance that one @entity5 member described as the " passing of the torch " from one @entity5 presidential nominee to the next			1
@entity2 poll : republicans divided on vice presidential choice national party officials , stressing their neutrality even though the @entity5 and @entity11 campaign aides have already informally started planning their joint efforts for the general election , pointed out that @entity52 and @entity53 were invited to the summit and will have emissaries here			1
both candidates are clinging to their tiny share of delegates and hoping for an upset at the party 's convention in august			0
but most of the @entity19 trekking to @entity1 for the meeting say that it 's time to move on to the next chapter of the campaign			1
" it 's clear that there is no likely scenario under which @entity11 will not be the nominee			2
he has won it , " said @entity72 national committeeman @entity71			0
" the committee will be meeting and doing its work , that 's the official business , " @entity71 told @entity2			0
" but i think a major focus of this meeting will be for people to start to come together behind the nominee and get ready for the contest in november			2
" @entity83 , a national committeeman from @entity84 , said the @entity11 speech on friday should be a " rallying point " for @entity19 in @entity0			1
" this is an opportunity to bring the party together behind @entity11 and pull everyone toward the general election , " said @entity83 , who endorsed the former @entity24 governor early in the primary process			1
not every @entity5 member is ready to fall in line			2
some , such as @entity96 national committeeman @entity95 , still harbor suspicions about @entity11 's conservative convictions and refuse to call him the nominee until he has accumulated the 1,144 delegates needed to secure the nomination			2
" if and when he is the nominee , i will support him , " @entity95 said			0
" but he is not the nominee			0
we are five months away from the convention or roughly that , so i do n't think its bad thing for these other candidates to be in the race			0
someone needs to hold @entity11 's feet to the fire on some of these issues			0
" his reluctance to support @entity11 was a rarity among the nearly two dozen @entity5 members and state party chairmen who spoke to @entity2 about the state of the race			1
now that they have their horse in @entity11 , most said they are excitedly gearing up for the fall election against president @entity126			0
@entity11 on november showdown : ' it 's going to be fun ' the @entity5 , which for decades has been the main vehicle for @entity5 get - out - the - vote operations in presidential elections , is using the chairmen 's meeting to showcase their plans for the race			1
@entity5 political aides will brief state party leaders on their national campaign machinery , region by region			0
new technological initiatives will be unveiled			0
committee finance officials will explain how they plan to keep pace with @entity126 's impressive fundraising muscle and fund the @entity147 , @entity148 , convention			0
there will be training sessions , speeches from @entity1 gov. @entity152 and @entity154 gov. @entity153 , a political briefing hosted by @entity19 pollster @entity156 , and plenty of late night margaritas			0
in the eyes of many @entity5 members , the @entity5 primary fight and the heated debates over new delegate rules that allowed the nomination process to drag on for months already seem like distant memories			1
but they will still meet several times this week to evaluate what worked during the primary battle and what needs to be fixed			0
" having gone through the primary and seen where there were some holes and weaknesses , i think it 's mainly the intention of our members to try and strengthen that up so there are fewer questions the next time around , " said @entity1 national committeeman @entity170 , the chairman of the @entity171			1
members will discuss the possibility of toughening penalties for primary states that violate @entity5 calendar rules			1
they will also examine whether to tweak the delegate rules that governed the nomination process and sparked a series of mathematical disputes between @entity11 , @entity16 , @entity193 and @entity53			1
at a meeting of the rules committee scheduled for thursday , one amendment will be introduced to protect four early voting states -- @entity96 , @entity198 , @entity199 and @entity154 -- from penalties if they decide to move their contest dates without @entity5 approval			1
another proposed amendment would completely scrap the rule that some primary states allocate their delegates proportionally instead of " winner - take - all , " a measure that lengthened the 2012 nomination fight by forcing the @entity5 candidates to hunt for delegates in more states than they did in 2008			2
even if the rules committee recommends changes to the 2016 nomination process , those adjustments would not face a formal vote until august , when the full @entity5 meets ahead of the party 's national convention			2
in the meantime , there is some consensus inside the committee that despite the damage done to @entity11 's approval ratings among certain key groups such as @entity229 and women , the primary process largely worked as it was supposed to work			2
" i think amongst the members , they feel that the proportional rules have been to the benefit of properly vetting the candidates , and they feel that that 's a good thing for the process , " said one influential @entity5 member who did not want to be named revealing private discussions			2
@entity71 , the committeeman from @entity72 , said the extended primary battle was a boon to @entity11			1
" it gives his candidacy greater legitimacy than it would have had he been deemed the presumptive nominee after just a few early states in january , " he said			0
" if that had been the result , there would have been a large number of @entity5 voters who would not have considered him to be a legit nominee			0
he won some , he lost some			0
but he won it fair and square			0
