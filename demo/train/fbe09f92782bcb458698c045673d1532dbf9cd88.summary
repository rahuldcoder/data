-- forget about @entity2 ' hat			1
we 're more interested in his skincare routine			0
somehow , the 40 - year - old musical everyman has been in the business for roughly 20 years without appearing to have aged a single day			1
as anyone with a job in the entertainment industry can tell you , that 's not easy			0
even the typical @entity13 attempts to appear younger end up going the opposite way			0
but " @entity2 " noticeably does n't have such problems			1
the producer and performer 's visage looks so youthful , some have even started to question whether there 's a supernatural power involved			0
the speculation has become so prominent that the @entity25 winner recently decided to put the gossip to rest			0
" no i am not ( a vampire ) , " @entity2 told @entity28 this week			1
" i 'm willing to go on record as saying that i do n't drink people 's blood			2
" then , @entity2 graciously shared his personal fountain of youth to the masses : " how do i stay so young - looking for a 40 - year - old ? " i wash my face			2
" it 's possible that answer wo n't satisfy conspiracy theorists , so we 're going to toss out one of our own : maybe being " happy " just goes a really long way .			2

@entity2 does n't look like he 's aged in the past 20 years
some *observers* began to wonder if he 's a vampire
the musician went on the record to *confirm* he 's not
perhaps it 's his *joyful* nature that 's *keeping* him young
