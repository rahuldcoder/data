-- you have n't experienced @entity3 lights until you 've seen nearly four miles of them artfully hung in patterns dictated by @entity7 's head designer in @entity9 's famed historic amusement park , @entity10 -- and that 's not counting the 1,800 strands dramatically draped on the lakeside willows			1
@entity16 , @entity15 's @entity14 is one of @entity19 's oldest markets			2
@entity9 celebrates jul ( as in " yuletide " ) in high style , with its famed @entity3 market the centerpiece			1
stalls stocked with fine handmade crafts , including traditional figurines of clog - clad elves in pointy red caps , compete for space with vendors selling iced doughnuts slathered with black currant jam and hefty cups of gløgg , a steaming hot mulled red wine laden with raisins , almonds , cinnamon sticks and cloves -- all of which , for good measure , are steeped in aquavit or schnapps			1
@entity3 in @entity19 is a time for elaborate pastries straight out of a medieval cookbook , for lyrical midnight masses in @entity48 churches and for the upholding of quirky local traditions -- in many countries , @entity3 just is n't complete without mischievous pixies , kindly witches ( @entity54 ) , treacherous demons ( @entity16 ) or an 8,000 - pound fruitcake ( @entity57 )			2
however else @entity58 celebrate the @entity60 season , @entity3 still centers around an @entity62 market that , in most cases , has filled the square before the cathedral each december for hundreds upon hundreds of years			1
many markets start on the friday before @entity62 , which is four sundays before @entity67 ; most end on december 24 , especially in @entity70 countries , where @entity67 is set aside for trimming the tree at home			1
others keep celebrating until @entity74 on january 6			0
travel + @entity75 : see @entity19 's best @entity3 markets these markets are where the romance of the holiday comes alive in grand tradition -- smells of gingerbread and roasting sausages waft through the cold air , handmade ornaments adorn ancient fir trees , master glassblowers and other artisans ply their crafts in wooden stalls , shoppers bustle past @entity48 church facades and half - timbered houses , pausing to sip their glühwein , heavily spiced and mulled " glow wine " -- the piping - hot beverage of choice at any self - respecting @entity101 christmas market			1
this is what @entity3 should be -- a holiday free of mall @entity104 and the frantic need to lay your hands on the superstore 's last @entity109			2
it 's an old - world @entity3 of heartfelt caroling and wooden toys , where every gift is crafted by hand and @entity117 has n't outsourced his workshop to @entity119			0
for a few precious frost - nipped weeks , these museum - piece cities of @entity19 flicker back to the @entity122 -- not the ossified medieval throwbacks of soot - blackened cathedrals and tourist - bedeviled museums , but the living , breathing yesteryear of a bustling outdoor marketplace			0
a few practical notes : it 's wise to book as far in advance as possible in these @entity3 hotspots , especially for trips between december 15 and january 1 and definitely for december 24 and 25			0
that goes not only for your lodging but also for restaurants , many of which close on @entity140 ; those that are open usually offer a set - price feast and book up fast with locals			0
planning a @entity145 getaway ? do n't miss @entity0 's new @entity146 copyright 2007 @entity147			0
