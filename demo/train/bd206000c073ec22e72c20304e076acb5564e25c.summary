@entity0 -- demonstrators took their shouts for an end to what they say is widespread and unchecked police brutality to an @entity8 arena in @entity9 , a famed department store in @entity0 , a well - known @entity12 commercial spot and to roads where they often brought traffic and passersby to a stop			1
streets in major cities throughout the @entity20 -- @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , among them -- filled again friday night with protesters			1
and while crowds appeared to be smaller than previous nights , marchers were just as passionate about their voices being heard			2
one sign held by a young black man in @entity9 read simply : " i could be next			2
" the protests are a response to the decision wednesday by a @entity0 grand jury not to charge police officer @entity37 in the chokehold death of @entity39 during his @entity41 arrest , which was captured on cell phone video			1
they come a week after another decision not to indict by a grand jury in @entity46 , @entity47 , examining the killing of @entity50 teenager @entity49 by a white police officer			1
in @entity0 , protesters in the rain passed out a list of demands to the media regarding the @entity39 death in july			1
the top demands were for all officers involved to be fired , for a special prosecutor to be appointed to investigate all complaints of excessive force and for the state legislature to make a chokehold punishable by significant penalties			1
a die - in at @entity67 earlier , @entity39 's daughter @entity68 told @entity1 's " the lead with @entity73 " that she wanted to see people punished for her father 's killing			1
" justice to me is basically doing what 's right , " she said			2
" i would n't be happy with ( @entity76 ) just losing his job or being suspended or still getting paid			2
i would n't want that			0
i would want him to face time in jail			0
" she said that anyone who contributed to her father 's death should go to prison			1
protesters flooded @entity67 's iconic @entity89 location and staged a die - in as holiday shoppers looked on			0
later , the flood of demonstrators shut off @entity94 to traffic for 10 minutes before the crowd headed down @entity97 , shouting , " this is what democracy looks like			2
" they stopped again in @entity102 and ringed a set of shops			0
many of the workers in those stores came out and , in support , raised their hands in the air			0
it was also a short stop , as the crowd set off up @entity113 , traversing against the flow of yellow cabs and other cars			0
a cacophony of car horns greeted the protesters and cabbies also held their hands out the window to give their approval			0
only about 50 people protested in @entity22 , but they marched with few breaks for hours			2
in @entity9 , the demonstrators held several four - minute long silent die - ins to empathize with the family of @entity49 , a @entity47 teenager who lie in the street for four hours after he was fatally shot by a police officer			1
" i 'm not an angry black man			0
i 'm an outraged , hurt black man , " one of the protest organizers told @entity1			2
six protesters shouted " hands up , do n't shoot " inside the @entity135 before an @entity8 game between the @entity137 and the @entity138			0

as many as 1,000 people were marching friday evening from @entity151 in @entity152 , @entity153 , near @entity21 to @entity154 , according to a police estimate			1
" people who do n't already realize what is happening , maybe they will open their minds a little bit or people that do realize and do n't care will realize that people are angry and it 's not ok , " @entity164 , a @entity21 demonstrator who would n't give her last name , told @entity1 affiliate @entity156 when asked why she marches			1
' so many people realize this is a problem ' those who turned out to protest were a mix of ages and races			1
@entity171 , a 67 - year - old @entity172 resident , marched in @entity0 clad in a union - issue hard hat and satin @entity176 jacket			1
a sign dangling around his neck said , " remembering my brothers			0
" the sign included photographs of @entity39 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 -- all black men whose controversial deaths made headlines			1
@entity185 was shot dead last month by a police officer in a dark stairwell of a @entity0 housing project			1

" it 's happening in every city , every town			0
it 's happening here in @entity247 , " @entity244 told @entity1 affiliate @entity245 on thursday			0
in many ways , it appears to be based on the @entity176 movement , which generated protests in @entity0 and elsewhere in 2011 over inequality , corporate influence and other issues			1
the largely leaderless and underground movement is using social media to organize protests , which have morphed from a wide - ranging agenda to a tight focus on the issue of police violence against black men			1
the mostly peaceful protests shared many similarities with the protests of the @entity266 -- marches , signs , civil disobedience			2
one @entity271 - @entity50 protester felt inspired by the 1960s marches , but said she believes that struggle shows change will take a long time			0
