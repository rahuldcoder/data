-- its official : deep cuts in federal spending are under way , $ 85 billion over the next seven months			1
the question we should all be asking soon is : where are the jobs ? the reason given by @entity10 and conservatives for the urgent need to drastically reduce federal spending was that mounting federal debt and big government was stifling private investment and economic output			1
now , we will see whether that justification for the spending cuts was fact or fig leaf			1
the truth is that the reductions in spending that will take place over the next year will , at a minimum , have no positive impact on the economy			0
in the worst case , the cuts could lead to increased unemployment and slower , if not negative , economic growth			0
in fact , many experts estimate the cuts are most likely to cost jobs : more than 700,000 according to @entity37 in no case are the recently enacted sequester cuts likely to stimulate job creation and increased economic growth			1
there will , however , be a good deal of measurable and immediate pain for millions of @entity46 households directly affected by the cuts			1
many of them will be families that have been teetering on the financial edge since the beginning of the recession , and many more will be those who have fallen permanently into " barely getting by " status			0
already , even the modest recovery that is under way is not equally shared			0
as the @entity57 last week pierced the 14,000 level to flirt with an all - time high , fourth quarter gdp for 2012 was reported to have increased at an annual rate of a mere 0.1 %			2
although that estimate could be revised upward in the months ahead , the fact remains that wealthy investors are largely immune to the pain being experienced by a major share of the @entity46 population			1
according to @entity70 , @entity69 professor @entity68 , fully 93 % of the increase in total @entity46 family income in 2010 , the first full year of recovery , went to the top 1 %			2
public policies such as stimulative @entity75 actions that are helping to inflate the stock market , and tax cuts for the wealthy , have combined to create a level of economic inequality not seen in the @entity46 since the @entity80			1
further , according to @entity82 , chief @entity46 economist at @entity84 , corporate earnings have risen at an annualized rate of 20 % since the end of 2008 , while household disposable income has barely moved , averaging an inflation - adjusted 1.4 % annually over the same period			1
the recently enacted sequestration cuts will further fuel the disparity between corporate america , the wealthy and middle class , and the poor			1
the truth is that there is no debt crisis that was necessary to address with these cuts			1
as our economy grows and people get back to work , the debt and deficit will naturally decrease with a rising tax base , increasing consumer spending and the public investment that comes with greater revenue and improved consumer confidence and business sentiment			2
the most effective way to promote that result , particularly now , given the economy 's current slow growth trajectory , is to invest strategically in the economy in a manner that will provide the incentives for new private investment , business growth and ultimately job creation			2
president @entity118 has repeatedly discussed the need to invest in the nation 's infrastructure			0
much of our infrastructure is aging and in dire need of repair or replacement			0
investing in infrastructure could enhance market efficiencies , promote green jobs , improve the environment and provide needed employment opportunities in urban and rural communities , as well as on @entity133			2
infrastructure investments could include bridge and highway construction and repair , new commuter and high - speed rail lines , upgrading communications systems , renovating or building new schools , community colleges and state - of - the art job training facilities , investing in dams , waterways and water treatment facilities , reclaiming key wetlands , and improving the basic livability of impoverished neighborhoods			2
for sure , large and growing federal deficits are a legitimate concern			0
but with 12 million workers searching for jobs , millions more working part - time but wanting full - time employment with flat or falling wages , nearly 13 million families owing more on their homes than they are worth ; with a nearly 40 % drop in net worth for the average @entity46 family , and gdp barely in positive territory , the economy is in need of a jump start , not a cutback			1
pulling back on federal spending now is equivalent to an unemployed worker refusing to go on job interviews in order to save on gas or bus fare			0
since the latter part of 2012 , @entity175 policymakers have been fixated on federal budget reduction			0
yet none of those conversations have led , nor are likely to lead , to the creation of a single job			0
the @entity46 public deserves better			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185			0

@entity187 : forced spending cuts are now under way . where will the jobs come from ?
he says cuts will cause pain in @entity46 households ; economists say more than 700,000 jobs lost
he says at the same time corporate earnings up , *widening* gap between rich , poor
@entity185 : cuts do *n't* address any debt crisis ; what 's needed is investment in job - building
