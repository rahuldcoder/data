-- @entity1 faced a revolt from leading @entity4 football officials tuesday over his intention to stand for re-election as @entity8 president for a fifth four - year term from 2015			1
according to @entity11 sources , @entity1 , 78 , told a meeting of the @entity4 football confederation in @entity14 that he would be seeking a further mandate			1
it reverses a pledge made in 2011 that he would not stand again and influential delegates at the meeting openly voiced their opposition to his u-turn			2
" the atmosphere was quite tense during and after @entity1 's short speech , " the sources told @entity0			1
@entity1 was directly challenged by @entity24 , president of the @entity26 fa , who told him that he should not continue after 2015 in his role			1
@entity24 , a member of @entity11 's executive committee , later relayed to gathered reporters outside the meeting what he had told @entity32			1
" i then said at the microphone : ' i like you a lot , there is nothing personal here , but the reputation of @entity8 is today inextricably linked to corruption			2
" @entity8 has a president			2
you are responsible , you should not stand again			0
" @entity42 , the @entity43 's representative on the @entity45 committee , also called on @entity1 to reconsider his decision to seek re-election			1
" the very fact in 2011 he was clear it was just for four years , that should have been the situation			0
to change his mind is disappointing , " he said			0
" i think we need a full , frank and open debate about what @entity8 needs going forward , " he added			2
@entity57 's colleague , @entity43 chairman @entity56 , criticized @entity1 in a strongly - worded statement to the meeting			1
@entity56 was angered over @entity1 's reported comments to the @entity61 ( @entity62 ) monday that allegations of corruption made against the successful @entity66 bid for the @entity67 were motivated by racism and discrimination			1
" i said to him , ' i regard the comments you made yesterday about allegations in the @entity75 media in which you described them as racist as totally unacceptable , " @entity56 told gathered reporters			0
" the allegations being made are nothing to do with the racism , they are allegations about corruption			0
" @entity56 also voiced his disappointment over @entity1 's intention to stand for re-election			1
" we accepted four years ago he was going to step down ( in 2015 ) and it 's a surprise he is going to stand again , " he told @entity83			2
" we would like to see an election , a competition and some different candidates , " added @entity56			0
the @entity26 and @entity75 representatives were not alone in expressing their dismay over the leadership of football 's world governing body			0
according to @entity11 sources , four members of its executive committee and its general secretary , @entity98 , openly questioned @entity1 's governance and his ability to lead necessary reforms in briefings to the media			1
@entity1 , who has been president of @entity8 since 1998 , will address its 64th @entity106 meeting wednesday in @entity14 where it is expected he will make public his decision to stand for re-election			1
the same meeting will also hear from @entity111 lawyer @entity110 , who has been appointed by @entity8 to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity114 , awarded to @entity115 and @entity66			2
@entity110 was given the task of probing allegations of bribery and corruption , but his findings are not due to be made public until @entity121			0
his investigation has been brought into sharp focus by a series of articles in the @entity75 newspaper @entity126 on the @entity66 bid			0
the newspaper claims to have unearthed millions of emails and other documentation which allege @entity66 's former @entity8 member @entity130 used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid			1
the claims have been strenuously denied by @entity66 organizers , who in a statement released to @entity137 said they had been co-operating fully with @entity110 's investigation			0
" we remain totally confident that any objective inquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the @entity67 fairly , " it added			0
the latest controversies come in the countdown to the @entity145 in @entity146 , which will start thursday in @entity14 with a game between the hosts and @entity149 .			0
