-- although the general public may be embracing the @entity4 community more these days , it does n't look like @entity5 is keeping up			2
that 's the message of @entity8 's @entity7 , which charts the " quantity , quality and diversity of images of @entity4 people in films released by the seven largest motion picture studios during the 2013 calendar year			1
" this year 's study found that of the 102 films released by the major studios in 2013 , only 17 included characters identified as lesbian , gay or bisexual			1
and of those 17 , the study concluded , most were minor characters , some of which @entity8 characterized as " defamatory representations			1
" " the lack of substantial @entity4 characters in mainstream film , in addition to the outdated humor and stereotypes , suggests large @entity5 studios may be doing more harm than good when it comes to worldwide understanding of the lgbt community , " @entity8 ceo and president @entity30 said in a statement			1
" these studios have the eyes and ears of millions of audience members , and should reflect the true fabric of our society rather than feed into the hatred and prejudice against @entity4 people too often seen around the globe			0
" @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 were graded as " adequate " for their portrayal of the community , while both @entity60 and @entity61 were rated as " failing " for " including only minor and offensive portrayals of @entity4			1
" @entity60 is owned by the parent company of @entity0			0
@entity64 was the only studio to receive a " good " score for having several @entity4 - inclusive films , including " @entity67 : @entity68			1
" two films , " @entity70 " and " @entity71 , " were singled out for having offensive portrayals			1
films were judged by the the organization 's " @entity74 , " named after the film historian and @entity8 co-founder			2
in order to pass the test , a film had to meet the following criteria : â € ¢ the film must contain a character that is identifiably lesbian , gay , bisexual and / or transgender			0
â € ¢ that character must not be solely or predominantly defined by their sexual orientation or gender identity			0
i.e. they are made up of the same sort of unique character traits commonly used to differentiate straight characters from one another			0
â € ¢ the @entity4 character must be tied into the plot in such a way that their removal would have a significant effect			0
they are not there to simply provide colorful commentary , paint urban authenticity or ( perhaps most commonly ) set up a punchline			0
the character should " matter			0
" of the 17 films with @entity4 characters , only seven passed the @entity74			1
the study also notes that unlike films , " tv seems to have entered another golden age , where the programming is not only incredibly thematically diverse ( and prolific ) , but is also fertile ground for creators to tell truly unique and innovative stories			2
not by accident , it 's also the best place in popular culture to find complex and resonant representations of @entity4 people that connect with a mainstream audience			2
" @entity124 bars federal contractors from @entity4 discrimination			0

@entity8 found that fewer than 20 *%* of last year 's films had @entity4 characters
two films were cited for having offensive portrayals
study notes that @entity134 is more inclusive
