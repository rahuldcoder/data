@entity0 -- sitting in an office with political memorabilia on the walls , former @entity0 mayor @entity5 reflects on the bad moments -- drug possession , jail , and tax evasion -- and notes that he has moved on			1
@entity5 is in many ways after a 40 - year public career the prototype for political disgrace and political resurrection			1
" i did n't run to be pope , i ran to be mayor , " said the usually blunt @entity5 , who rejected any suggestion that his most notable fall from power two decades ago was a scandal			1
" everybody in life has something that they get knocked down on , " @entity5 told @entity1			1
" the object lesson here is not that you get knocked down , it is that you get up			0
" a recent poll showed that the veteran of the @entity31 who was first elected to public office in the 1970s and currently holds down a @entity35 seat , is now the most popular local politician in the @entity0			0
rebounding from setbacks that might have crushed others professionally , the @entity37 representative has become an expert in political recovery			0
scandals erode trust and polls show the public is wary following a string of high profile embarrassments			0
last year alone in @entity0 , @entity49 members @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 all left office amid scandal			2
closer to home , @entity0 's city council chairman @entity55 became the second embattled member of the panel to resign this year			1
@entity0 mayor @entity60 's victorious 2010 campaign also is under an investigative cloud			2
what would @entity5 do ? while it may be surprising , a politician looking to bounce back might ask : what would @entity5 do ? when asked what recommendation he would offer politicians in trouble , @entity5 allowed a chuckle			1
reflecting on his experiences , @entity5 highlights courage , resilience and appreciation			1
" when there is adversity around you , whatever kind it is , you can not let it interfere with your work , you can not let it give up your trust of the people and you ca n't let yourself look like you are just down and out , " @entity5 , 76 , said			1
@entity5 added that scandal can make a politician resilient and better suited for the rough and tumble of public life			1
" i think people in general in this country are distrustful of politicians , even at the presidential level , " @entity5 said			1
but to most @entity0 political experts , @entity5 has added to that distrust			2
@entity93 , a veteran political analyst , said some still look at @entity5 's professional longevity as an example of what is wrong with @entity98 politics more than 20 years after @entity5 , while serving as mayor , went to jail for drug possession			1
" he is the model of what is perceived as corruption and bad behavior , " @entity93 said			0
" @entity5 is the personification of everything that is bad government , a persona that overwhelms the political system			2
" @entity93 has known @entity5 for decades and said his best asset is his ability to calculate who votes and how to play to that group			2
" his greatest strength is his audacity , his shameless confidence in himself , " @entity93 said			0
" he once told me , ' my whole life , people told me what i ca n't do			0
and i never accepted that			0
' i think that is an accurate exception of how he feels			0
" @entity0 credibility issues @entity60 recently became the third mayor out of the last four to serve the capital to be stung by ethics questions			0
it surfaced this year that @entity60 knew in january that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign , according to a source close to a federal investigation of his campaign funding			0
earlier this year , a public relations consultant pleaded guilty to helping orchestrate a secret campaign on @entity60 's behalf , prompting three of @entity60 's former colleagues on the @entity0 council to call for his resignation			0
" the city government has a real serious credibility problem , a real serious trust problem , a real serious big picture problem and people are just disgusted to some extent , " said @entity5 , who has been friends with @entity60 for 35 years			1
" the good news is that they have not blamed individual politicians like myself for all of that			0
" and that may @entity5 's best -- although unspoken - advice for bouncing back from scandal			1
when asked about transgressions , @entity5 generally deflects , denies and then credits himself for moving on			2
to this day -- after the 1990 drug conviction , a six - month jail sentence , and a 2005 guilty plea to misdemeanor tax charges -- @entity5 denies that he ever had a political scandal			1
according to @entity5 , the only thing he did wrong was avoid paying income taxes			2
" million of @entity98 do n't file their taxes , " @entity5 said			2
" i am not saying it is right , but that happened and that is behind me , too			0
" @entity1 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
