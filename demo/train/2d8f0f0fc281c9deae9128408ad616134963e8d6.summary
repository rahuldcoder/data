-- could a massive passenger jet slip past radar , cross international borders and land undetected ? that 's a key question investigators are weighing as they continue the search for @entity8 , which vanished march 8 on a flight between @entity10 , @entity11 , and @entity12			1
radar does have some blind spots , and it 's possible to fly at lower altitudes to avoid being spotted , analysts told @entity0			1
but experts are divided over whether that could be what happened to the missing @entity21			1
@entity22 , a security consultant and former @entity24 special agent , says someone could have planned a route that avoided radar detection			1
" it certainly is possible to fly through the mountains in that part of the world and not be visible on radar			1
also , an experienced pilot , anyone who wanted to go in that direction , could certainly plot out all the known radar locations , and you can easily determine , where are the radar blind spots ? " he said			1
" it 's the type of things the @entity43 did when they went into @entity44 to go after @entity45			0
" on monday , the @entity11 newspaper @entity46 reported that the plane may have flown low to the ground -- 5,000 feet or less -- and used mountainous terrain as cover to evade radar detection			1
the newspaper cited unnamed sources for its reporting , which @entity0 could not immediately confirm			0
and a senior @entity55 military official told @entity0 on monday that military radar near the @entity57 is n't as closely watched as other radar systems			1
that leaves open the possibility that @entity55 radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known @entity11 radar contact , near the tiny island of @entity67 in the @entity68			1
@entity43 officials have said they do n't think it 's likely the plane flew north over land as it veered off course			1
if it had , they 've said , radar somewhere would have detected it			1
landing the plane somewhere also seems unlikely , since that would require a large runway , refueling capability and the ability to fix the plane , the officials have said			1
@entity11 officials said monday that they were not aware of the @entity11 newspaper 's report			0
" it does not come from us , " said @entity87 ceo @entity86			0
analysts interviewed by @entity0 said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time , and that it 's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes			1
" five - thousand is n't really low enough to evade the radar , and that 's kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway , and we 're visible to radar , " said @entity98 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity43 @entity100			1
" it just seems really highly improbable , unless we 've been overestimating a lot of other countries ' radar system capabilities , " said @entity107 , an aviation and maritime attorney			1
@entity113 , a former @entity114 officer who 's now national security editor for @entity115 , said radar would have detected the plane if it flew over land			1
" this is a bus in the sky			0
it 's a lot harder to get under the radar with this kind of thing than i think most people realize , " he said			1
" so really , while the search i know has extended to this vast area stretching up into ( the nations and central or south @entity129 ) , clearly there really should be much more of a search over open water , because this is not getting past people 's radars			1
" it would n't be easy to avoid radar detection , experts say , but it could be done			1
" anything like this is possible , " radar expert @entity139 told @entity0 's @entity143			2
" but to do it , you 'd have to have very detailed information of the type of radars , their disposition , their heights and their waveforms to pull that off			0
" different countries would likely be using different radar systems , he said , but it 's unclear how advanced the technology is in many countries			2
" it took a great deal of skill to do this , " @entity0 aviation analyst @entity159 said			2
" i think somebody was at the controls who understood the value of altitude control to eliminate the possibility of being spotted and tracked on radar			2
" whoever was in control in the cockpit , he said , " really had the ability to map out a route that was given the very best chance of not being detected			0
" one other possibility , he said : the plane could have shadowed another plane so closely that it slipped by radar detection			1
other analysts say that would require so much skill that it would be nearly impossible to pull off without getting caught			0
there 's another possible wrinkle , experts say			2
some countries may be hesitant to reveal what they 've seen on radar			2
" they want to protect their own capabilities , " @entity22 said			0
" their intelligence services are not going to want to publicize exactly what their capabilities are			0
" here are other developments in the search and investigation , as search crews from 26 nations continue scouring vast swaths of ocean and land for any trace of the airliner : timeline clarification @entity86 said monday that it was n't clear whether the final words from the cockpit came before or after the plane 's data - reporting system was shut down			1
earlier , @entity11 authorities had said the message " all right , good night " came after the system had been disabled			0
the voice message came from the plane 's copilot at 1:19 a.m. saturday , march 8 , @entity86 said			2
the data system sent its last transmission at 1:07 a.m. and was shut down sometime between then and 1:37 a.m. that day , @entity86 said			0
grief counselor : families holding on to hope as authorities keep searching for the plane , the loved ones of the 239 passengers and crew members who were on board are left in limbo			1
helping them has been difficult , grief counselor @entity231 told @entity0 's " @entity234			1
" " grief counseling , or any kind of recovery from this , has to have a starting point			2
and the starting point is having a verdict of what happened , " he said			0
" without a starting point , every day people 's emotions go up and down , from hope to despair			2
" he heard some family members cheer when they learned that hijacking was possibly what caused the plane 's disappearance			2
" because that means they could still be alive , " he said			0
" they 're trying to hold onto any little bit of hope			1
" @entity260 response @entity260 said monday that it had deployed 10 ships , 21 satellites and multiple aircraft to aid in the search			2
premier @entity265 spoke with @entity11 prime minister @entity266 to ask for more information to help speed the search along , according to a statement posted on the @entity260 government website			2
a top @entity11 official denied the allegation that his country had held back information about the missing flight			2
" our priority has always been to find the aircraft			0
we would not withhold any information that could help , " acting transport minister datuk seri @entity280 told reporters			0
" but we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigations team			0
" @entity286 pulls out destroyer the @entity288 and its helicopters have stopped combing the @entity290 and are no longer part of search efforts for the missing plane , the @entity286 said			1
the move is partially because @entity296 are taking over the majority of the searching in that area , @entity43 officials said			0
a @entity43 p - 8 aircraft will move to @entity301 , @entity296 , to be based there for searching			0
fewer @entity43 assets will be involved in the search for the missing plane , but @entity43 officials said the @entity305 will be able to cover a wider range of ocean more quickly than the ship could			1
" this is actually much more effective for the overall search , " cmdr			0
@entity312 of the @entity43 @entity313 told @entity0 's @entity314 monday			0
" the real challenge is this huge expanse of water			0
i keep saying , if you superimposed a map of the @entity43 on here , it 'd be like trying to find someone anywhere between @entity324 and @entity325			0
so that 's the challenge here , " he said			0
" we have amazing , dedicated air crews			0
it 's just a matter of how much area we can search			0
" @entity0 's @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity314 and @entity335 contributed to this report .			0

new : grief counselor : families are trying " to hold onto any little bit of hope "
experts are divided over whether plane could have slipped past radar
analyst : radar blind spots could be determined " easily "
@entity288 pulls out of the search for the missing plane
