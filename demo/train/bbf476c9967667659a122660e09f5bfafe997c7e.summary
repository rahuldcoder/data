-- @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have all released their workforce diversity reports in the past few weeks			1
these reports have sparked much hand - wringing about the low number of african - americans and @entity10 who are working in @entity12 tech companies			1
we expect to see a tide of more reports , illustrating a dismal situation needing attention			1
but , too often , stunned commentators overlook a simple fact : this problem is fixable			0
tech companies need more workers , and african - american and @entity25 communities need more work			1
@entity12 has an insatiable demand for genius			0
communities of color have an untapped supply of it			0
putting aside any blaming or shaming , tech leaders and communities of color could greatly benefit by coming together -- to ensure that @entity34 stops wasting so much genius			1
neither @entity12 nor low - opportunity communities can afford it anymore			1
for instance : 70 % of " @entity38 " are men , 30 % women ; 61 % are white and 30 % are @entity42			0
blacks and @entity25 ? only 2 % and 3 % , respectively			1
@entity1 's may 2014 report could best be summed up with the company 's own words : " we 're not where we want to be			1
" these reports have their place			2
but let us first keep in mind : as important as transparency is , simply releasing these numbers wo n't solve the problem			0
in fact , @entity54 , one of the world 's largest tech companies , has been openly sharing its diversity stats for the past decade -- and should be applauded for doing so			1
and yet the company still struggles with hiring minority talent			0
only one thing will make a difference : a job - training pipeline specifically designed to identify , recruit and train talented people from nontraditional backgrounds and low - opportunity communities			1
@entity68 hosts its first hackathon imagine , if you will , a promising black or @entity25 child , sitting behind a public school desk in @entity73			0
that youth is seated just half an hour 's drive from @entity12			2
but it would take something like a miracle for that child to ever find her way into a coding education program , let alone an internship or job at the world 's most famous tech companies , right down the road			1
we need to fix this -- and we can			0
we wo n't have to start from scratch			0
many grass - roots educational organizations are already working to solve this problem			1
they are inventing and pioneering powerful new models to bring coding education to new constituencies			0
unfortunately , none has reached the necessary scale			0
@entity34 desperately needs an efficient solution for diversifying talent in the tech sector			2
if existing programs could work together in smart ways , with the best ones getting support to scale up dramatically , we could create a process that would pull extraordinary talent out of unlikely places , like @entity73 , or @entity109 , or a native american reservation , or , for that matter , @entity112			2
one effort to create those synergies and build that pipeline is called @entity116 , an initiative i helped start			2
our goal is to help grass - roots groups train 100,000 low - opportunity youth to become high - level computer coders			1
here is how we 're doing it : exposure : first , # @entity126 , with the help of @entity4 , is creating an online platform to unite more than 70 tech - training organizations , so young people can easily and conveniently connect to coding education programs			1
training : second , we are investing in workforce development programs that target people who would n't normally have access or the opportunity to enter careers in tech. our model includes " boot camps " and accelerated tech - training programs to equip young people with the skills they need to succeed in a high - level tech job			1
@entity143 : most important , we are establishing an employers ' council to ensure this pipeline results in gainful employment			2
this council is also building the core movement to open the doors to invite more low - opportunity talent into this pipeline			1
top executives at companies like @entity155 and @entity4 have already expressed interest in joining this council and making meaningful changes in their workforce			1
our nation is sitting on an untapped goldmine of talent : amazing young people who have the creativity and the courage , but need the skills			2
for example , take @entity167			0
he is a young @entity168 - @entity34 man who grew up in group homes			2
after his younger brother was shot and killed behind their childhood elementary school , he made a lifelong commitment to transforming the lives of young people			2
at 16 years old , he founded a tech company to serve low - income neighborhoods			1
@entity167 went on to co-found @entity178 , a start - up that works to close the @entity180 ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics ) gap in education			2
this past february , @entity167 created a pioneering " hackathon " in @entity73 , @entity187 , to highlight black male achievement			0
young black kids came together for three days to connect , create and code			0
it was a group of hoodie - wearing , laptop - wielding future @entity193 -- who all look a bit like @entity196			0
it was , almost certainly , a sign of things to come			0
plenty of other low - opportunity young people are waiting to live out their own success story			1
that 's a problem we can solve			0
we just need to give them the opportunity			0
imagine urban youth who are not just downloading apps , but uploading them			0
and when they succeed , they will change a lot more than the workplace diversity numbers in @entity12 .			0

@entity214 : @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 reports show dismal diversity levels
@entity214 : tech companies need more workers ; blacks and @entity10 need more work .
he says we need a job - training pipeline to identify , recruit and train people
@entity126 will help grass - roots groups train 100,000 low - opportunity youth
