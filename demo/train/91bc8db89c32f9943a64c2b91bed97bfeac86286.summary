-- when someone asks when the @entity3 abandoned its longstanding position as the party of family values , we will all be able to say it was shortly after 8 p.m. @entity8 on january 19 , 2012 , in @entity9 , @entity10			1
when the invited audience of 2,300 republicans stood up and applauded @entity15 's angry and defiant response to the opening question from @entity0 's @entity17 about allegations leveled by the ex-wife of the former speaker of the house , it was clear that the @entity3 , always judgmental about marital fidelity with @entity22 , threw that out of the window			1
the @entity3 's desire to beat president @entity25 at any cost , and its unwillingness to coalesce around @entity28 , clearly outweighs its view on rampant adultery by one of its leading presidential candidates			1
those willing to make excuses for @entity36 's cheating on his second wife , @entity37 , with his current wife , @entity39 ( he also cheated on wife no. 1 with @entity37 , who later became wife no. 2 ) are quick to say that the @entity43 faith requires forgiveness			1
and that is absolutely right			0
but when has @entity36 apologized to president @entity46 and vice president @entity47 for his routine missives declaring both of them morally corrupt ? when has @entity36 ever said publicly that while he was ripping others to shreds , he was doing the same to his marriage vows to forsake all others ? the nation clearly was made aware of @entity46 's extramarital affairs while serving in the @entity57 with the impeachment trial			1
but nothing of the sort was said about @entity47			0
yet that did n't prevent the bombastic @entity36 from lobbing his morally bankrupt grenades towards the @entity64 @entity57			2
now we know that while he was doing that , he was deeply involved in a torrid affair with @entity39 , then a @entity70 staffer			0
what was amazing thursday night is that we were in @entity10 , the @entity72 , where evangelicals hold significant sway			0
just last year , @entity3 were aghast when the governor , @entity75 , was busted for engaging in an international extramarital affair , hiding away in @entity77 and lying about his whereabouts			2
details of his sordid affair made national headlines and embarrassed the state and the national party			2
@entity85 were disgusted with his behavior , and the potential presidential candidate who was a darling of bible - thumpin ' social conservatives ended his tenure in shame , losing his wife in the process			0
so why was the @entity3 so quick to leap to their feet as @entity36 castigated @entity17 for even asking the question ? no doubt they will say it was his denunciation of the media for asking such a tawdry question			1
others will say that @entity15 's multiple affairs were common knowledge and since he was a declared changed man , we all should move on			0
but how can someone like @entity36 stand up in debates and forcefully talk about the sanctity of marriage when he has no history of believing what he is saying ? how can any social conservative talk about the moral fiber needed in a presidential candidate when the man many of them love has none ? it 's highly likely that when the group of influential social conservatives met in @entity125 last weekend to coalesce around a candidate , @entity36 's rampant cheating was too much for them to overlook and that 's why they settled on @entity128			1
the @entity3 loves to scream from the mountaintop about family values , but when a sen. @entity133 of @entity134 continues to sit in the @entity135 after it was revealed he often used an escort service , then their protestations ring hollow			1
and there are many other republicans who have had to come forward , some unwillingly , to own up to their transgressions			0
see , when republicans are busted for cheating on their spouses , they will quickly play the forgiveness card			0
yet is n't a failure to have character and integrity at home a sign of how someone will act in the workplace ? and it must gall the @entity3 to watch @entity25 often dote on his wife , and make clear that even while in the @entity57 , his family is a top priority			1
@entity36 is correct in stating that many of the folks in the audience understand personal pain			2
but when @entity15 himself , and his party , has shown little concern in the past about such pain when it has affected someone in the other party , their pleas for understanding looks like shameful pandering			0
so to the @entity3 , your high - minded and sanctimonious positions about others not having morals and values should end			1
if you are willing to accept @entity15 with all of his failings , then you had better open your arms for a whole lot of other sinners who have also sought @entity180 's redemption			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity36 's defiance to question about his ex-wife 's remarks met with cheers
response ended @entity3 's standing as party of family values , @entity183 says
@entity183 : @entity197 's *lukewarmness* to @entity28 , *loathing* of @entity25 has come to this
if mercy is the standard , @entity36 should apologize to the @entity203 , @entity183 says
