@entity0 -- two of the three individuals believed to be involved in a potential 9/11 anniversary plot against @entity0 or @entity5 are @entity6 of @entity8 descent who traveled to the @entity6 last week , according to a @entity6 government official			1
however , another law enforcement official said there is no evidence so far that any of the three individuals came to the @entity6 or are here now			1
" nothing 's really panned out yet , " the official said			1
still , authorities are operating under the assumption that two of the people have arrived on @entity6 soil , and they have been piecing together clues gleaned from flight logs and manifests , among other sources , said the @entity6 government official , who declined to be named			1
a third person is believed to have been traveling through @entity27 , though it is not clear whether that person has arrived in the @entity6 , the government official said			1
it is still not apparent whether a plot is under way , officials say			1
" it 's still ongoing , " @entity0 police commissioner @entity34 said about the potential threat			1
" nothing significant has changed			0
the threat has been identified as being credible and specific and uncorroborated			1
" @entity6 spy networks had intercepted communications of a potential attack from an @entity44 operative in @entity45 , derived from a source who has provided accurate information in the past , officials say			1
no other corroborating evidence of an attack has been uncovered , but it has prompted intelligence officials to sift through communications from other @entity44 cells			2
the information suggests the plan -- thought to involve a vehicle - borne explosive device -- is meant to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks			0
the exact type of strike , however , is largely unclear and the plot still remains unconfirmed			2
@entity6 officials rarely speak on the record about intelligence intercepts			1
and in the days following the raid on @entity68 's compound , officials indicated @entity44 had gone to great lengths to avoid having its communications intercepted by the @entity6			1
while the precise nature of communication intercepts is rarely discussed , @entity6 officials repeatedly have indicated their comfort with sharing the results of those intercepts			1
authorities also say they have picked up " chatter , " or widely divergent communications , from extremists that suggest the newly tapped @entity44 head , @entity81 , is in some way involved in the current plot			1
meanwhile , heightened security was visible saturday in @entity0 and @entity5 as intelligence officials worked to pin down information about the potential threat			1
three stolen trucks were added to a @entity90 database because of the threat , said deputy police commissioner @entity92			1
the database is connected to the @entity90 's digital license plate readers			1
" we 're adding them in the interest of being prudent , " @entity94 told @entity1 , emphasizing there is no known link to the terror threat			2
commissioner @entity34 echoed that point			1
" we 're not ruling it out , but there 's nothing of significance right now that would connect these thefts to the threat that we 're facing , " he said			1
two of the trucks were owned by a construction company that operates at the @entity111			0
they were reported stolen over a week ago			2
a budget rental truck was also stolen in a separate incident from a @entity115 , @entity116 , storage facility august 21			0
" whoever did it went to great lengths to cover their tracks , " @entity94 said			0
" they cut lines to phones and surveillance cameras			0
" @entity94 also said the city has experienced " a three-fold increase in suspicious package calls , " while suspicious vehicle calls have doubled			0
@entity0 law enforcement officers , meanwhile , have been put on 12 - hour shifts			1
in @entity5 , police chief @entity131 reported that " suspicious activity and suspicious vehicle reporting sky - rocketed last night			0
" " i can tell people in this community ( are ) really on it , " said @entity134 , adding that her force had beefed up staffing			2
in neighboring @entity141 , officials are trying to locate two missing u-haul vans , though a police spokesman said authorities " are not viewing this as terrorism - related			1
" cpl. @entity147 said the vans were reported stolen saturday			0
on saturday , president @entity150 met again with his senior national security team about the threat , according to a @entity154 statement			0
the @entity6 president has " directed his team to pursue vigorously all threat information and to ensure a heightened state of vigilance and preparedness , " the statement said			1
@entity6 vice president @entity161 also weighed in friday , saying the information was at least in part gleaned from the may raid against @entity68 in @entity165 , @entity45			2
" this is the first ... credible piece of information we 've gotten , " @entity161 told @entity167 's " today " show			2
" all hands are on deck			0
" it is not clear how the @entity68 raid helped authorities connect the dots to the prospect of an anniversary attack , but @entity161 downplayed the threat of a widely sophisticated plot involving multiple conspirators			2
he said the administration 's principal concern is a plot from a " lone actor , not some extremely complicated plan like it took to take down the world trade ( center ) towers or the plane in @entity190 ( @entity191 ) or the @entity192			2
" on saturday morning , police officers stopped and searched for a third day box trucks as they approached the @entity195 , which links @entity116 with @entity0 , as well as the @entity196 , the @entity197 and the @entity198 , connecting the boroughs of @entity200 and @entity201			0
police manned checkpoints in @entity204 and downtown @entity205 , where they examined vehicles , particularly vans and trucks , for possible bombs			0
they are also sweeping parking garages for explosives and using digital license plate readers to check for stolen vehicles , officials said			0
authorities say they are seeking people who could help disrupt the threat and are questioning individuals who have previously raised security concerns			2
@entity0 gov. @entity221 , meanwhile , has directed state police and asked @entity223 to help secure areas during the anniversary weekend , bolstering an already heightened level of security			0
" we already had a great security plan in place , and in an abundance of caution , we 're deploying more resources , " he told reporters			0
" we should n't allow this threat to diminish the importance of the 9/11 anniversary , because that would be doing just what the terrorists want us to do			0
" a senior @entity6 administration official said friday that it is the " origin " of the intelligence information that is causing particular concern			1
@entity6 officials believe that operatives came out of the tribal @entity45 - @entity248 border region -- a volatile semi-lawless area that is home to extremist groups -- and that they are part of @entity44 " central			1
" the official also noted a possibility that @entity45 - based groups such as @entity255 or @entity256 could be involved			2
intelligence officials believe @entity44 " likely maintained an interest since at least february 2010 in conducting large attacks in the homeland timed to coincide with symbolic dates , to include the 10 - year anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks , " according to an intelligence bulletin issued thursday			0
@entity68 's death and the " removal " of senior @entity44 figures since then could add to the organization 's desire to stage an attack on a symbolic date such as september 11 , the bulletin said			0
in @entity5 , local officials said the city has a robust plan in place and has been on heightened alert since september 1			0
" i want to urge all of our citizens ... to remain calm and let our law enforcement professionals do their job			1
at the same time , we ask people to remain vigilant , " mayor @entity283 said			0
" if you see something , say something			0
" federal officials said they are taking the threat seriously , while trying to temper the news by saying such threats are commonplace in connection with key dates			2
" the @entity297 has been in a planning mode for months with the local and state police officers , as well as the other intelligence agencies , to prepare for this weekend , " said @entity294 , assistant director in charge of the @entity297 's @entity5 field office			0
" what we have here is a little bit more of a public display than we normally have			0
" @entity1 's @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0
