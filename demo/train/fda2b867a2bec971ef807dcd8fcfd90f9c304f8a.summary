-- when men and women enlist in the military , they take an oath to support and defend the @entity6 , including the @entity7 , against all enemies , foreign and domestic , and affirm that they will " bear true faith and allegiance to the same			1
" that oath is betrayed by legislation that sneaked through the @entity12 last week and was signed into law by the president monday			2
known as the " @entity16 , " it passed as a small piece of an otherwise unexceptional omnibus veterans ' bill			0
it would broadly expand existing restrictions on political protest on public land near military funerals			1
notably , the @entity25 of @entity26 is actively litigating against similar state legislation that is far narrower in some respects			0
protests can not be held within 300 feet of the cemetery , and the law bans conduct that blocks someone from entering or leaving the cemetery within a 500 - foot radius			2
protests are prohibited two hours before the funeral through two hours afterward			0
it similarly expands restrictions on protests at government cemeteries and gives people injured by the protest a right to sue			1
although it covers all protests near military funerals , the law is targeted , at the @entity48 , and that 's a @entity7 problem in and of itself			1
its members believe that the wars in @entity51 and @entity52 , and the attendant casualties , are divine punishment for @entity56 's acceptance of lesbian and gay rights			1
they protest outside military funerals to publicize their beliefs -- holding signs that say " pray for more @entity61 " and " @entity62 killed your sons " -- but do not cause any disruption of the funeral proper			1
now , as repellent as these protests are , they are a permissible exercise of the freedom of speech			0
if the @entity7 means anything , it 's that the government can not target a group for censorship because it disagrees with the group 's message			1
this legislation does exactly that			0
sen. @entity81 , @entity82 , introduced the bill a month after the @entity84 ruled in @entity85 that , as lawful speech on a public issue , @entity48 protests warranted the highest protection of the @entity7 against state tort claims			1
but the imprudence of this legislation goes further			0
part of the public reaction to @entity48 protests , as happens with much unpopular political speech , are counterprotests			1
those would likely be barred as well by the expanded law , under its " tendency to disrupt " language			0
if the counterprotests are immune from the law 's reach because the government agrees with their message , the law will be doubly unconstitutional			2
the issues raised by this new law are a lot like those in the dust - up after @entity114 ceo @entity113 spoke out against same - sex marriage			0
i agree that @entity114 should n't be celebrated as some sort of free speech hero , and if you choose not to indulge in a @entity114 chicken sandwich in protest of intolerance , more power to you			2
but i 'm more concerned by the suggestion of a @entity126 alderman that he would go so far as to block a local @entity128 's building permit simply because of @entity130 's views , rather than any discriminatory policy of the chain			0
in some ways , a willingness to ignore the law to shut down someone with whom you simply disagree is worse than @entity130 spouting off against marriage equality			0
part of living in @entity56 means putting up with words with which you not only disagree but that offend deeply			0
this is especially true when , as in the @entity48 case , the words actually carry a political message			1
the expansiveness of the new law violates this core principle			0
it is n't about protecting the solemnity of a soldier 's funeral ; that 's already fully protected under existing trespass , private property and disorderly conduct laws			2
it 's about censoring unpopular speech			1
that is inconsistent with the law , the @entity6 and the military 's oath to the @entity6			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

a new law expands limits on political protest on public land near military funerals
@entity166 : @entity174 targets @entity48 , which rallies at military funerals
@entity48 's claim that troops die as divine *retribution* is protected by @entity7 , he says
@entity166 : all political speech , even if it 's unpopular or hateful , must be protected under law
