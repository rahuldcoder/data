@entity0 , @entity1 -- millions of people will breathe a sigh of relief that @entity6 has finally been held to account for the years of violence , misery and suffering that he brought to the people of @entity11			1
@entity6 , a former president of @entity12 , was found guilty after a lengthy trial by a special court sitting in the @entity15 for aiding and abetting rebels during the bloody conflict in @entity1 between 1996 and 2002			1
the violence in @entity1 shocked the world as thousands of civilians were caught up in the fighting			1
limbs were hacked off as punishment , mass killings and gang rape were common and thousands of children were forced to fight or become sex slaves			1
the survivors still struggle with the mental and physical scars of their ordeals			1
incredibly , despite the tens of thousands of cases of documented atrocities , only 13 people have been held to account for these crimes			1
and , under a 1999 amnesty agreement drawn up in a desperate bid to end the fighting , @entity6 may be the last to stand trial for what happened			1
everyone else -- his commanders and lieutenants and fighters on all sides -- remain free to go about their lives as if nothing happened			2
@entity6 's conviction brings some measure of justice to the people of @entity1 , but it is only the first step in a long journey back to normalcy for the people			1
years after the end of the war , people are still grappling with the challenges and the legacies of the violence			1
since the @entity66 published its report in 2004 , only a limited number of recommendations on reparations have been implemented			2
without a long - term , sustainable plan and sufficient funds to assist survivors to rebuild their lives , many are begging in the streets for a living			2
failing to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes under international law gives the impression that they will not have to face the consequences of their actions			2
it ignores the distress of the victims and creates a risk of further violations			0
the failure to address impunity weakens state institutions , denies human values and debases the whole of humanity			2
prosecutions serve to clarify the truth about what happened , establish accountability for human rights abuses and contribute to building confidence in the rule of law			0
without them , victims are left to suffer without official acknowledgment of the crimes committed against them or assistance to rebuild their lives			0
although the initial prosecutions of @entity6 and his cronies were restricted to those individuals considered to bear the " greatest responsibility " for crimes under international law , the government of @entity1 authorities must now move to hold others to account			1
it must rescind the 1999 amnesty and strengthen and build an independent criminal justice system so that further investigations and prosecutions can be made			0
justice needs to go hand in hand with peace			0
in neighboring @entity12 , similar violence between 1989 - 1996 and 1999 - 2003 saw countless attacks on civilians resulting in death , disfigurement and displacement			0
as in @entity1 , government and armed opposition groups used rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls as deliberate strategies , as a weapon of war and to instil terror			1
women of all ages were victims , including very young girls and older women			0
it is estimated that as much as 60 - 70 % of the population suffered some form of sexual violence during the conflict			0
by the end of the war in @entity12 , more than 20,000 children were believed to be involved in the conflict			2
both boys and girls were abducted and forced to fight , carry ammunition , prepare food or go to the front line			0
in many cases , child soldiers were forced to carry out killings , torture , rape and other forms of sexual violence , looting and abducted and forcibly recruiting other children			0
currently , there are no plans for @entity12 authorities to investigate the crimes under international law committed during the 14 - year conflict			2
instead , the people in @entity12 are expected to forgive and forget the past and just move on			0
but , like the people of @entity1 , the victims of past human rights violations in @entity12 have the right to know the truth , obtain justice and be granted full reparations for what they suffered			1
with similar investigations now under way involving grave crimes committed in northern @entity185 , @entity186 and the @entity187 , @entity6 's conviction sends a signal that authorities are finally moving to end impunity , establish the rule of law , promote and encourage respect for human rights and restore and maintain international peace and security			1
but official moves to hold perpetrators to account must be transparent , comprehensive and fair			1
they must remember and involve the thousands of victims			0
and they must ensure that justice is done			0
otherwise , those who committed some of the most egregious crimes imaginable are getting away with murder			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

during @entity1 fighting , limbs were hacked off as punishment
@entity215 says survivors still struggle with mental and physical scars
