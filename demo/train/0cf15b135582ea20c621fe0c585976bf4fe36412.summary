the @entity10 budget for 2011 unveiled monday calls for about $ 172 million for the federal government to acquire and renovate the state - owned prison in @entity13 , @entity5 , and another $ 66 million to eventually staff and equip it			1
the budget requires congressional approval , and several lawmakers in both the @entity19 and @entity20 have vowed to block the funds , potentially preventing the transfer of many of the 192 remaining @entity7 detainees to @entity26 soil			1
" even though @entity26 are facing tremendous economic challenges , the administration has chosen to spend $ 237 million dollars in taxpayer money to provide free travel , room and board in @entity13 , @entity5 for some of the most dangerous @entity7 detainees , " said a statement monday by rep. @entity28 of @entity29 , the ranking @entity30 on the @entity31			1
" it is time for the president to focus on the security and economic needs of the @entity26 people , rather than on the needs of those dangerous extremists who seek to do us harm			1
" even if the funds are approved by the start of the 2011 budget year in october 2010 , @entity10 officials said monday the transfer of any detainees was unlikely to start until several months later			2
