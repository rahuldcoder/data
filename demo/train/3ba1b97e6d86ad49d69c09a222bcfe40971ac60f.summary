-- sounding as much like a @entity4 leader as a @entity5 one , @entity2 's president is denouncing @entity6 in strong terms , but even in firm opposition he 's hardly embracing the @entity10 - led military effort intent on destroying the extremist group			1
@entity14 , in an interview with @entity13 , characterized @entity6 's recent beheadings of three @entity4 captives are offensive to all people , including muslims like himself			1
" they want to kill humanity and , from the viewpoint of the @entity27 tenets and culture , killing an innocent person equals the killing of ( all ) humanity , " @entity14 said of @entity6 militants , according to the translation on @entity13 's website			1
" ... the killing and beheading of innocent people , in fact , is a matter of shame on them and a matter of concern and sorry for all ... mankind			0
" the only relevant thing about the victims is that they were innocent , not their nationalities or religions , according to @entity14			0
the three killed were @entity45 aid worker @entity44 and @entity10 journalists @entity46 and @entity48			0
@entity48 was @entity49 and had dual citizenship with @entity51			0
" who can really tolerate to see an innocent person be executed ? " said the @entity2 president			1
" it does n't make any difference , from our viewpoint , if the person is @entity59 , @entity49 , @entity60 or ( a ) follower of any other religion			0
it is not important to us ... which nationality he belongs to			0
" @entity14 's position on @entity6 is n't entirely new or unexpected			2
the group is made up of @entity68 aiming to create a vast caliphate in the region under its strict , distinct version of @entity73 law			0
@entity2 consists predominantly of @entity74 , and it could find itself under attack if @entity6 militants move east from @entity77 into its territory			2
@entity2 is n't alone in its stance on @entity6			2
@entity10 president @entity80 has been active in his opposition to the group , ordering airstrikes targeting @entity6 in @entity77 and promising similar air attacks on the group in @entity86			2
in his @entity13 interview , @entity14 did not appear supportive or impressed with @entity89 's plan to form a coalition -- one which he called " ridiculous " -- or its using airstrikes , rather than ground forces , to combat the @entity6 threat			1
@entity80 , @entity96 : no @entity10 troops to be sent into combat the @entity2 president asked rhetorically if the @entity10 , by conducting airstrikes but refusing to put its own troops into battle , is " afraid of their soldiers being killed in the fight they claim is against terrorism			1
" " if they want to use planes and if they want to use unmanned planes , so that nobody is injured from the @entity10 -- is it really possible to fight terrorism without any hardship , without any sacrifice ? " he added			1
@entity14 then made an apparent allusion to possible airstrikes against @entity6 in @entity86 -- something that @entity10 officials would be done without coordinating with the government of president @entity122			1
@entity89 has backed moderate opposition forces working to oust @entity122 ; @entity124 , meanwhile , is an ally of the embattled @entity86 leader			0
" maybe it is necessary for airstrikes in some conditions and some circumstances , " @entity14 told @entity13 's @entity127			2
" however , airstrikes should take place with the permission of the people of that county and the government of that country			0
" @entity139 , the secretary of @entity2 's @entity140 , told state - run @entity141 that @entity2 turned down an invite from @entity145 foreign minister @entity144 to join the @entity10 - led alliance to fight @entity6			1
@entity139 surmised wednesday that one of this coalition 's chief goals is to protect @entity51 and that @entity124 does n't believe it will be effective			1
" the alliance ... for confronting this terrorist group is an effort to forge safe borders for the @entity155 regime rather than bring about regional stability and security for the oppressed people of the ( @entity5 ) , " he said .			0
