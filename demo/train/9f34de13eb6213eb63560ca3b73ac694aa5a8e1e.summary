@entity0 , @entity1 -- republicans got first serve in their convention last week			0
can @entity5 break serve , or will the presidential race go to a tiebreaker in november ? here are five things to watch for at the @entity9 : 1			0
new man on the big stage -- most @entity12 have never heard of the mayor of @entity14			2
they will after tuesday night when @entity15 becomes the first @entity16 to give the keynote address at a @entity9 convention			1
past keynote speakers such as @entity20 and @entity21 made it to the @entity23			2
maybe that 's raising too many expectations for @entity15 , but his speech will be looked upon the same way			2
2016 contenders -- sen. @entity29 of @entity30 and vice presidential nominee @entity31 gave blockbuster speeches at the @entity34 convention in @entity35 , @entity30			1
@entity38 gov. @entity37 's keynote address did n't go over as well			1
all three could make bids for the @entity34 presidential nomination in 2016 if @entity42 does n't win in november			2
so which @entity5 are waiting in the wings ? @entity44			0
@entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 of @entity48 and @entity49 of @entity50 all have an opportunity in @entity0			0
turncoats -- is @entity53 the @entity54 of this convention ? @entity54 , the former @entity9 congressman from @entity56 who seconded @entity21 's nomination four years ago , had a high - profile speech at the @entity34 convention			1
now it 's @entity53 's turn			0
what will the former @entity34 governor of @entity30 , who could possibly run for his old office as a @entity64 , say when he gets in front of the podium in @entity0 ? 4			1
what will @entity20 say ? -- there 's probably more anticipation , and questions , around the former president 's wednesday prime - time address			1
once former adversaries when @entity75 was running against @entity21 , @entity20 has become one of @entity21 's strongest advocates			0
but the big question is what will @entity20 say when he nominates @entity21 for re-election wednesday ? @entity21 campaign officials said they have n't seen @entity20 's speech yet , but they said they are " not worried " about what he 'll say			1
the ticket -- the traditional role of running mate is to be the attack dog			0
will vice president @entity89 slam @entity42 as much as @entity31 attacked @entity21 ? and how much of what the president will say in his acceptance speech is a defense of his first term and how much is an outline of what he wants to do over the next four years ?			0

@entity14 mayor @entity15 will give the keynote address
possible 2016 contenders , many of them governors , will be on *display*
former @entity30 gov. @entity53 takes his shot at the @entity34
anticipation is high for former president @entity20 's wednesday night address
