-- under the guise of making check - in as seamless a process as possible , airlines have strived to put as much in the hands of the passenger as possible			1
the baggage - drop has been the one sticky area that continues to demand a level of interaction with staff			2
that is slated to become a thing of the past , however , as more carriers opt to handover that responsibility to flyers			0
last month , @entity18 launched @entity19 , a system of print - at - home luggage tags aimed at shaving minutes off the check - in process			1
@entity18 is the first @entity23 carrier to introduce such a process			1

" everything is more or less organized by the customer			0
they manage themselves , and it allows us to manage them faster			0
" passengers weigh their bags at home , fill in the weight and measurements online , then print out the tags on an @entity44 piece of paper , which they fold in fourths and stick in a reusable plastic sheaths ( available for free at any @entity49 airport )			1
the extra effort at home pays off , says @entity25			0
" traditionally , we get congested during the summer season			0
customers can wait ten to 15 minutes to check in their bags , " he explains			1
" we 've brought that down to 30 seconds per customer			0
