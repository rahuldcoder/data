@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the distinctive colorful clogs loved and hated in equal measure , first hit stores in 2004 and were an immediate hit			1
by 2007 , the @entity1 - based company was selling 50 million pairs a year , reaching $ 850 million in sales			1
then it all went south			0
the economic collapse in 2008 , combined with a saturated market , created what @entity3 ceo @entity14 described as a " perfect confluence of events			1
" " too many people have the same product , selling it to the same consumers , and just our inability to evolve as a brand caused a turn of fortunes in the business , " he said			0
the company was hit hard			1
in one year , it went from a $ 200 million profit to a $ 200 million loss in 2008			1
there were too many @entity3 in too many stores , and some people had grown weary of the comfortable , but not exactly fashion - forward , design			1
by early 2009 , the company was almost out of cash and struggling to make payroll			2
it needed to find a way to attract new customers			0
" we had to innovate our way out of the situation we had put ourselves in , " @entity14 said			1
in other words , the company would have to expand beyond its classic clogs if it was going to survive			2
" i think you do get to the point where maybe everybody has a red and a blue and a black pair and they are looking for something else , and that was part of the strategy , " said @entity48 , the company 's vice president of product design			0
" we need to offer different looks for people because they ca n't wear the same thing every single day			0
" while @entity3 clogs were undeniably popular , they were also scorned by fashionistas and people tired of seeing the colorful plastic shoes nearly everywhere			1
one hater started an i hate @entity3 blog , and another launched a @entity73 page called " @entity74 , you look like a @entity76 * * " which has more than 1.6 million " likes			1
" @entity14 is familiar with the criticism of the original @entity3 design			2
" when i first wore the shoes home ... my wife says to me , ' what are those ? those are the ugliest shoes i 've ever seen , ' " he said			0
" and you know there 's a certain truth to that			0
" but within the company , there was a notion that perhaps even critics could find something to love about @entity3			1
" a lot of the haters did n't like the way other people looked in them , but they did maybe resent a little bit the comfort those people had and that they had the courage to go ahead and go out in public and wear them , " explained @entity95 , @entity3 ' senior vice president of product			2
so the company set out to create a new line of shoes -- flats , wedges , sneakers , boat shoes , even winter boots -- that would be as comfortable as the clogs , but would appeal to more style - conscious consumers			1
" it 's so funny , someone actually stopped me in a mall and said ' where did you get those shoes ? i love them , ' and i said , ' these are @entity3 , ' " @entity48 said			2
" [ people ] say , ' @entity127 , where can i buy these ? ' that 's the normal reaction we get from people , " she said			0
" there has been hardly any resistance			0
" @entity3 still sells plenty of its old - school clogs , but the new designs now account for 54 % of the company 's sales			1
" our main focus today is getting new customers to understand that we 're no longer just a clog , " @entity14 said			0
" i think this is our biggest challenge as a brand today ... getting people to take a look at us in a different way			0
" to showcase the new shoes , @entity3 has opened 120 stores in the @entity149 and hopes to open another 100 stores this year			2
it is also expanding into new overseas markets , which now account for 65 % of sales			0
with the new designs leading the way , @entity3 is back in the black			2
last year , the company make $ 150 million in profits and $ 1 billion in total revenue			1
" we 're a very young company , we 're barely 10 years old , " @entity48 said			0
" [ these ] ups and downs have taught us about how to compete and how to have a comeback			0
