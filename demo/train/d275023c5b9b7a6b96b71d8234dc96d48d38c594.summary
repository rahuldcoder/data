the suspect was apprehended away from his home , a law enforcement source told @entity0			2
authorities are trying to determine if the bomb attempt was part of a conspiracy , but for now , the scheme seems to be a " lone wolf " situation , the source said			2
in january , the @entity60 said it would consider recent local @entity62 activity in its investigation of the backpack bomb			1
but this week , authorities still have not publicly linked the bombing attempt to any specific group or organization , @entity9 said			0
the bureau has been looking into the incident as " an act of domestic terrorism , " @entity69 , special agent in charge of the @entity60 's @entity7 field office , said in january			1
the investigation was aided by detailed forensic and follow - up work on the backpack bomb itself , the law enforcement source said			1

the bomb was found the morning of the parade in january by three workers before the event began , authorities said			1
the @entity60 released photos of the @entity92 - brand backpack and two t - shirts found in it			1

" on wednesday , @entity8 gov. @entity99 credited the three workers and law officers , saying when the @entity7 's emergency response system was put to a test , " it worked as it should have and prevented what could have been a terrible tragedy on a day of celebration			1
" " i again want to commend the three workers who reported the suspicious backpack to authorities , and the law enforcement officers who responded , " @entity99 said in a statement			2
also on wednesday , @entity10 attorney general @entity113 expressed gratitude no one was injured in the bombing attempt			0
" i can say that it was a viable device			0

and we were fortunate that it did not go off and people were not killed			0
we were just lucky in that regard , " @entity113 said			0
the device contained a chemical found in rat poison and was packed with little metal pellets , apparently as shrapnel , another law enforcement official told @entity0 in late january			2
the device was set up to be detonated remotely , that official said			0
the two neo-nazi activities the @entity60 referred to in january occurred in nearby @entity134 , @entity135 -- one on the @entity138 holiday and another three days earlier			1
@entity134 is 35 miles east of @entity7			1
three days before the holiday , a handful of @entity62 in @entity134 protested two @entity141 restaurants with signs saying , " this is white land " and " we want you out of here			0
" during the evening of the holiday , about 15 neo-nazis demonstrated outside the @entity147 in downtown @entity134			0
the @entity134 area had been a hotbed of neo-nazi activity through the @entity151 and @entity152 hate groups since at least the 1970s , though the groups were disbanded through criminal convictions and civil lawsuits by 2000 , said @entity157 , one of the founders of the @entity159 on @entity160 in @entity134			0
