@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , i 'm @entity17			2
if there 's one thing i 'm sure of , it 's that fridays are awesome ! and this friday edition of @entity0 is about ready to take flight			1
first up : @entity24 @entity26 president @entity25 : peace must be made by @entity28 and @entity29 , but each of us has a responsibility to do our part as well			1
those of us who are friends of @entity28 must understand that true security for the jewish state requires an independent @entity36 , one that allows the @entity29 people to live with dignity and opportunity			2
and those of us who are friends of the @entity29 must understand that the rights of the @entity29 people will be won only through peaceful means , including genuine reconciliation with a secure @entity28			2
@entity45 : there were a lot of subjects that president @entity25 talked about yesterday at the @entity24			1
he discussed the economy , the environment , the wars in @entity53 and @entity54			1
but the main focus of his speech was what you just heard him discuss : efforts to create a peace deal between @entity28 and @entity29			1
there 's been tension between those groups for decades			2
president @entity25 says it 's time for them to come together			1
one quick note on that speech : the @entity28 representatives were n't there while president @entity25 was talking			1
that 's because it was a @entity71 holiday			2
pledge to @entity26 @entity45 : well , republicans in @entity74 are making a pledge to @entity26			1
it 's essentially a promise to try to change some government policies			2
@entity80 minority leader @entity79 explained why they came up with it			2
@entity83 @entity79 , ( r ) minority leader : our government is out of control in @entity88 , and we need to reign it in and begin a new drive for a smaller , less costly and more accountable government in our nation 's capital			2
these are the things that the @entity26 people are demanding , and our pledge to @entity26 is that the @entity73 stand ready to get it done			1
@entity45 : @entity99 leaders say the pledge will take @entity26 back to old policies that they claim did n't work in the first place			1
the pledge includes things like cutting taxes and some government spending			2
it also takes aim at the new health care reform law			1
@entity110 has more on that			2
( begin video ) @entity113 , ( r ) delaware senate candidate : i would fight to repeal the bill			2
@entity110 , @entity0 correspondent : it 's a @entity73 battle cry for the midterm elections			1
sen. @entity119 , ( r ) @entity120 : the @entity26 people will be heard , and we 'll repeal and replace			1
@entity123 , ( r ) nevada senate candidate : i have pledged as my first act of legislation to put in a repeal @entity128 law			1
@entity130 : if @entity73 win a majority of seats in @entity74 , one of the first things they promise to do is repeal president @entity25 's signature achievement : health care reform			1
@entity137 : what 's your response to that ? @entity130 : under a new @entity73 - controlled @entity80 , @entity143 congressman @entity142 would likely become chairman of a key @entity145 overseeing health care			1
he says hearings would begin as soon as january to dismantle the law			1
rep. @entity142 , ( r ) @entity143 : if we 're given the opportunity to be in the majority , we are going to try to repeal it and then replace it ... @entity130 : right away			2
@entity154 : ... with something that makes sense			2
well , the sooner the better			2
@entity130 : that threat comes as new portions of the law go into effect this week			1
provisions that stop insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions or dropping policies for people who get sick			2
big expansions of coverage do n't come until 2014			2
still , recent polls show the law remains unpopular			1
@entity83 @entity171 , ( @entity172 ) @entity173 : i voted against the health care bill because i thought it would be too expensive			1
@entity130 : even some @entity99 are running against it			2
@entity179 secretary @entity178 argues the public will come around			2
why is this law so unpopular ? @entity178 , @entity182 : i think it 's more confusing than unpopular			1
i think that ... @entity130 : you 're ready to have this debate all over again ? @entity187 : i am indeed			0
@entity25 : hello , hello , hello			1
@entity130 : so is the president , who points to parts of the bill that are popular			1
@entity25 : if young people do n't have health insurance through their employer , then they can stay on their parents ' health insurance up to the age of 26			1
@entity130 : parts congressman @entity142 wants to keep			0
are there portions of the law that should be kept ? @entity154 : i think coverage of pre-existing conditions			1
the ability to keep your insurance and not have it revoked unless ... @entity130 : rescissions			0
@entity154 : ... unless you committed fraud			0
@entity130 : other republicans say scrap the whole thing			0
conservative activist @entity215 , with the group defundit.org , says the solution is to starve the law of money			1
@entity219 , @entity220 : one of our only options is defunding			0
go after some of the smaller provisions			0
we will not let @entity178 implement and enforce this law			1
( @entity226 ) just the facts @entity228 , @entity15 : just the facts			0
a concussion is an injury that affects how your brain works			0
they 're usually caused by a hit to the head , but you do n't have to lose consciousness to have a concussion			0
symptoms can include dizziness , nausea and confusion			0
concussions can affect your memory , reflexes , speech and balance			1
and if you 've had a concussion , you 're more likely to suffer another one			0
concussion hearing @entity45 : those things are serious			0
you hear about concussions in pro sports			1
younger athletes suffer these head injuries as well			0
you might know someone who 's had a concussion			0
between 2005 and 2008 , an estimated 400,000 concussions happened in high school sports			0
@entity74 wants to find a way to cut down on concussions			1
yesterday , they heard from medical experts , parents , students and pro athletes about the issue			0
@entity74 is thinking about passing a law that would require student athletes who suffer head injuries to get checked out before they can get back on the field			1
the bill would also require schools to train coaches , students and parents about how to deal with concussions			0
this day in history [ @entity279 ] september 24 , 1960 -- the @entity26 launches the @entity280 , the first nuclear - powered aircraft carrier september 24 , 1789 -- the @entity282 establishes the first @entity26 @entity283 september 24 , 1957 -- federal troops go to @entity285 , @entity286 to enforce the right of black students to attend a public school @entity290 @entity291 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! what kind of animal is a pangolin ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it a : a ) @entity302 , b ) fish , c ) mammal or @entity305 ) reptile ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! pangolins are mammals that are mostly found in @entity309 and @entity310			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! plight of the @entity315 @entity45 : now before you say that 's kind of a funny looking creature , there may be a point where there are n't very many left to look at			1
pangolins are in danger of dying out			0
in parts of @entity309 , the animals are hunted illegally for their meat and for the scales that cover their bodies			1
@entity331 shows us how some people in @entity5 are trying to help the pangolins survive			0
( begin video ) @entity336 , @entity337 , vietnam : pity the pangolin , but most people have never even heard of one , let alone seen one of these endangered ant - eating mammals			1
the way things are going , they may become famous because there are none left			0
two species are especially under threat in @entity309 : the @entity351 pangolin and the sunda pangolin			1
experts say both are being hunted to extinction			0
@entity356 , @entity357 : i think we 're going to watch those species , both species disappear over the next 5 to 10 years if we do n't do anything , which is intensely sad			1
you know , they were listed as common until fairly recently			0
@entity365 : it 's why this special pangolarium has been built in @entity5 's @entity368			0
staffs are trying to rehabilitate rescued pangolins , which are notoriously difficult to keep			0
but at least here they are safe from the poachers who prize their meat			0
@entity374 : they 're such an interesting little mammal , you know			0
it 's devastating to think that these animals , you know , might go extinct while we 're watching if we do n't do enough			0
@entity365 : at the rescue center , they are hoping to slowly start releasing captured pangolins after they 've been given a clean bill of health			1
but they need funding and more staff to ensure these creatures do n't disappear completely in just a few years ' time			0
@entity331 , @entity0 , @entity392 , @entity5			1

before we go @entity45 : before we go , would n't it be cool to kinda just watch tv at your job ? hey , ladies , get back to work ! they are at work			0
this farm in @entity7 -- yes , it 's near @entity6 -- set up plasmas as part of an experiment to see if the cows would make more milk if they were watching tv			0
it turns out they do ! experts think watching pictures of pastures helps relax the cows -- we 're not making this up -- and that this puts them in the right mood for milking			0
goodbye @entity45 : but you know they 'll eventually want to watch moo - vies			0
they should milk this thing for all it 's worth , make the farmers cow - tow to them for a while			0
