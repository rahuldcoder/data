-- if there 's attention to be had , you better believe the @entity4 know how to grab it			0
on tuesday night , @entity6 was on fire thanks to two posts made by @entity9 and @entity10			1
one of the images , posted by @entity10 , made a joke about the @entity13 that has unleashed a wave of criticism			1
and then , just a few hours after @entity10 posted ( and deleted ) the inflammatory photo , @entity9 decided to unleash her naked , oiled butt onto the world			1
the 34 - year - old posed for the winter issue of @entity22 , which has the express goal of " breaking the @entity24			2
" ( in that case , @entity22 can consider its mission accomplished			2
) the publication chose photographer @entity28 to do the honors , asking the artist to recreate his " @entity32 " photograph			1
the result is one cover in which @entity9 poses in a floor - length gown , balancing a glass of champagne on her rear , while the other cover puts the reality star 's best known asset front and center in all its glistening glory			1
if you 're curious , husband @entity44 approves			0
" and they say i did n't have a talent , " @entity10 tweeted after sharing the photos			2
" try balancing a champagne glass on your a * * lol			0
" that does n't sound easy , but we 'd say the @entity4 also have a clear talent for provocation			0
before @entity9 set out to # @entity57 , her younger sister was on the verge of doing so as well			1
@entity10 , 30 , posted a picture on @entity6 of herself with her sisters @entity9 and @entity61 that was captioned : " the only @entity13 to ever let black men in			1
" it is n't clear where the image originated , but @entity10 shared that along with her own comment , calling the statement " true			2
" ( @entity10 was married to an @entity70 basketball player , @entity69 , and @entity9 has dated a number of famous @entity70 - @entity70 men , from singer @entity73 to athlete @entity74			1
) the post has since been removed , but the controversy has n't been erased as easily			0
@entity10 has n't explicitly commented on the reaction , but some believe one of her recent @entity6 posts is an attempt at an apology			0
" we 're all equally f * * * * d up , " says the photo in the post , which was shared tuesday			0
" some only hide it better			0
" over on his own @entity6 account , @entity61 's partner , @entity88 , chimed in with his spin on the statement			0
posting the same photo , he added one amendment to the image 's text : " the only @entity13 to ever let black men in			2

@entity9 shows her rear view on the cover of @entity22 magazine
there 's an *alternate* cover that recreates @entity28 's " @entity32 "
meanwhile , her sister @entity10 was taking heat for a crude joke about the @entity13
