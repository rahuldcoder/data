-- if you sat down with an accomplished self - portrait photographer , the last thing you might expect to hear is " i 'm a bit uneasy in my skin right now			1
" but that 's what @entity7 tells me as she eyes the voice recorder i 've set between us on her living room couch			1
she tucks her legs beneath her			1
" in fact , " she says , " i have to admit i 'm a little freaked out			1
" @entity18 's inhibitions are understandable			1
she spent ten years creating striking , seductive images of her own 269 - pound frame , and now , suddenly — with the top portion of her stomach cinched by a silicone @entity24 and the extra weight melting away — her subject is disappearing before her eyes			1
as we chat about her past and her work , @entity18 laughs easily , and before responding to a question , she wrinkles her forehead so you can practically see her thinking			1
she 's beautiful , with bright blue eyes and the kind of straight blonde hair the rest of us have to fake			2
but because she 's been obese most of her life , @entity18 is racked with insecurities			1
since she was a teenager , she has preferred to interact with the world from a distance , through the lens of a camera			2
during her high school years , she was constantly snapping photos of kids in the hallways and the cafeteria as a photographer for the yearbook			2
" i used the camera to gain access , to communicate , " she says			2
@entity56 : what inspires the most creative people we know but the pictures she took outside school — abandoned cars on a nearby reservation ; the teenage boys she pined for as they jammed with their garage bands — reflected her growing sense of isolation			2
over time she began to focus on capturing the loneliness in others			2
" it was like i was taking self - portraits , " she says , " except i was n't in them			1
" when @entity18 was 23 , her work took a turn : reading through her old journals , she was struck by the fact that her grievances — being overweight , missing out on romantic love — had been the same for years			1
maybe , she thought , if i turn the camera on myself , i might shake loose whatever is holding me back			2
in the first self - portrait she ever snapped , @entity18 sits on a bamboo mat on the sand , on spring break in @entity90 , her one - piece bathing suit concealed by a green cover - up and black shorts ; the friends around her are slender in their bikinis and swim trunks , and the uneasiness on her face is palpable			1
@entity99 began a decade - long project , during which @entity18 shot hundreds of images of her body			1
" a lot of artists use self - portraits to transform into other identities			1
but my intention was to understand myself better			2
to articulate myself through the lens			2
" @entity56 : 7 steps to creating the life you really want the photos are arresting			2
in one , @entity18 is fresh out of the shower , wrapped in a maroon towel , water droplets dotting her pale shoulders			1
in another , she is floating on her back in a concrete water tank , her limbs spread like starfish rays			2
some shots convey her anxieties more directly : her fingers trying to button a too - small pair of pants ; her eyes doleful as she lies awake in the toned arms of a sleeping man			2
@entity18 never imagined an audience when she began the project			1
had she envisioned her photos hanging in museums and galleries , she would n't have been as bold , she says			0
but it was n't long before the powerfully raw images generated buzz in the photography world			1
@entity18 was accepted to the @entity142 's @entity144 program			1
galleries in @entity146 , @entity147 , and @entity148 exhibited her work			0
the @entity151 published her photos			0
she won awards and grants , and colleges and museums invited her to lecture on her portrayals of beauty and sexuality			0
and then , in the spring of 2011 , during a photography residency in @entity160 , @entity161 , while @entity18 was reviewing her portfolio — dozens of portraits blown up and hung on the wall — she was struck with the same feeling of horror she 'd felt reading through her journals when she was 23			1
" in ten years , my body had n't really changed , and i had n't changed , either , " she says			0
" the problem was that i was making myself vulnerable only for the camera			0
what i really wanted was to be vulnerable for another person			0
" @entity56 : emotional eating : get your feelings out of the fridge that summer @entity18 underwent @entity24 surgery , and after ten months , as this issue goes to press , she has lost 95 pounds — bringing her weight down to 174			1
despite the very real physical limitations created by a @entity24 , patients who undergo the procedure must commit to eating healthily for long - term success			0
the failure rate , says @entity186 , @entity187 , of @entity188 , who has performed hundreds of these operations , is between 40 and 50 percent			0
@entity18 has not only adjusted to a new lifestyle but dedicated herself utterly to it			1
she has revamped her diet — eating mindfully ( without distractions like the computer ) , avoiding simple carbohydrates , enjoying the feeling of filling up on nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables			0
she also hits the gym twice a week for cardio and weights , and does @entity205 twice a week at home			0
@entity18 had always assumed she 'd die young when she was obese and a heavy smoker , and on some level , she was okay with that			1
now she shudders to recall that feeling of indifference			0
there 's so much to live for — including the thrill of going on first dates			0
" i 'm 34 , and i 've never had a boyfriend , " she says with a wistful smile			0
" i have a lot to learn			0
" @entity56 : 7 foolproof rules for changing your diet but with all the changes , @entity18 has struggled artistically over the past year			1
she found herself craving a break from photographing her body as it began to slim down ; she felt more beautiful and more desirable than ever before — but also more exposed , without all the extra weight to shield her from the world			1
it was n't until this spring that she finally aimed the camera at herself again			0
" i thought the self - portraits might help me process my new life , " @entity18 says			1
" i was ready to go back under my microscope			0
" she is surprised and excited by what she 's discovering in her recent images : " my sexuality feels tangible for the first time			0
there 's a change in tone			0
where i once saw an overpowering sadness , i now see confidence			0
" it 's in her gestures , and the way she holds herself			0
in @entity18 's favorite portrait so far , she is looking at her reflection in the mirror			1
" you can tell from my expression that i 'm not being critical , " she says			0
" you can almost see the realization on my face : i am open to myself			0
