-- music and travel have always gone together			1
but if you were to name 12 great travel - inspired tracks from the last 20 years , where would you start ? no , putting @entity6 on shuffle to transform 11 hours of bun - numbing economy class tedium into a " spiritual journey " does n't count			1
you 'd probably find it hard to start at all			2
while performers like @entity14 and @entity15 continue to crank out tunes that celebrate destinations like @entity18 , barely anyone seems to be writing great songs about travel any more			1
once a life - changing event , leaving on a jet plane is now something everyone does , all the time			2
high fuel prices and dull highways means epic car journeys are often out of the question			0
and the only people still hopping freight trains inevitably wind up mangled in machinery			0
so , with due apologies for excessive wallowing in classic guitar licks of years gone by , please fasten your seatbelts and familiarize yourself with the safety procedures as we embark on a journey through the best travel tunes ever recorded			1
@entity42 : ' @entity43 ' ( 1967 ) this wistful @entity45 ballad telling the story of an achy - hearted traveler 's sadness at leaving a loved one and not knowing " when i 'll be back again " is an anthem for long - distance love			1
in these days of volcanic eruptions , angry passengers and unhelpful counter agents , it could simply be a mundane tirade against the uncertainties of commercial flying			0
sad but apt fact : in one of popular music 's most apt demises , @entity45 died when his experimental plane crashed into the @entity63			1
@entity64 ' ( 2005 ) as a director , @entity65 has become the modern bard of hits ( " @entity70 , " " @entity71 " ) and misses ( " @entity72 " )			0
as a compiler of soundtracks , we 'd probably put him above @entity76 as the best in the biz			0
though among his less celebrated films , 2005 's " @entity86 " showcases one of his most memorable collections of excellent , semi-obscure tunes , highlighted by this strummy rocker about the gypsy lifestyle from @entity85 's critically acclaimed @entity64			1
the song takes us from @entity88 to @entity89 to @entity90 , but finds that all of us share the universal desire of chatting up a @entity92 in a parking lot in @entity94			0
( somehow this all works really , really well			0
) @entity97 gon na do ? fact : a great soundtrack could n't hide the flaws in " @entity86 , " which gets just a 28 % approval rating from critics on @entity102			1
@entity103 : ' 24 hours from @entity104 ' ( 1963 ) clearly a song of its time , @entity103 's hit is a tale of unexpectedly falling in love a day 's drive away from an existing relationship			1
it would n't happen today because the song 's protagonist would have hopped onto a budget airline and made the journey in a couple of hours -- although he could perhaps have squeezed in a quick flirtation with the woman in seat @entity121 who was giving him those looks ... slightly tasteless fact : the @entity126 hotel room where @entity103 died of heart failure in 2006 was about 24 hours ' travel time from @entity104			1
@entity129 : ' @entity130 ' ( 1977 ) not to be confused with @entity133 's execrable 1984 song " passengers , " or the 2003 album " passenger " by @entity136 nu metal band " passenger , " @entity129 's restless punk anthem cleaves a ragged path through the dark heart of an unexplored urban landscape -- or at least it used to until it was appropriated ( with lucrative results for mr. @entity129 no doubt ) to peddle cars , @entity147 and cosmetics			1
sell - out fact : apparently no longer content to be a passenger , @entity129 himself -- old , wrinkled but still shirtless -- once advertised car insurance in the @entity154			0
@entity155 : ' @entity156 ' ( 2008 ) before you start hurling heavy objects at your screen , hear us out			0
yes , this might be a feeble attempt to keep this list current , but @entity155 's melodic mash - up of @entity165 's " @entity164 " and @entity167 's " @entity166 " is about travel			1
sure , @entity155 's incoherent polemics on global oppression create as many critics as fans , and all the edgy stuff about visas and hustling on " @entity156 " is somewhat undone by the misfiring irony of the song 's cartoon violence -- but there 's no avoiding the fact it was a solid platinum hit			1
@entity181 fact : @entity155 's strident support for @entity185 's @entity184 fighters led to her being branded a " terrorist sympathizer " by the island 's government			1
the @entity189 ' ( 1982 ) this splash of @entity192 sunshine unabashedly wallows in the giddy romance of a holiday fling without coming to terms with the fact that -- this being the 1980s -- he was just some sleazeball waiter who probably beds a different girl group every week			1
@entity189 's guitarist @entity199 gets extra travel points for her 1985 solo single " @entity202 " and her cameo in " @entity205 's @entity204			1
" surprising subcontinental fact : lead singer @entity207 now has a home in @entity209 , @entity210			0
@entity211 : ' @entity212 ' ( 1966 ) this great travel song celebrates the tedium of being stuck in a dead - end en route to somewhere slightly better , which as any passenger knows , is half the fun			1
another contender from @entity211 is " @entity225 , " veering off the beaten track to name - check the workmanlike destinations of @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224			1
" @entity212 " is a candid admission that being on the road blows and you 've had enough			2
dirty fact : " @entity212 " was reputedly penned by @entity231 after he was stranded for the night at @entity233 station in @entity234			0
@entity233 ' only other significant export is pollution			0
@entity237 ' ( 1991 ) @entity238 's occasionally be-paisleyed , troubadoring @entity239 may have been using travel as a metaphor for the emotional distance that being away from home can inflict but with references to " spending half my life in airports doing crosswords and attempting to sleep " and the soul - crushing burn that accompanies life " at the bottom the corporate tree , " this paean to airport barstools and estimated times of arrival is the weary road warrior 's most sympathetic anthem			1
nautical fact : the crew of the @entity238 @entity262 frigate @entity263 declared " 1,000 @entity264 " its unofficial theme song during the ship 's last voyage before being decommissioned in 2005			2
@entity269 : ' @entity270 ' ( 1975 ) in truth you could conjure up a whole album of restless whines from the king of modern folk rock			0
tunes like " @entity278 " and " @entity279 ' " inspired legions of disenfranchised youths to make tracks , even if no one really knew what @entity269 was on about			2
there 's more clarity to be had from " @entity287 , " even if he resorts to harping on about " clowns and jugglers " yet again			2
but nothing rivals the epic trans - @entity225 poetry of " @entity294			0
" acting fact i : @entity269 won an @entity296 in 2000 for " @entity297 , " featured in the movie " @entity299			0
" just as well , since his woeful attempts at acting would never make the grade			0
@entity303 : ' @entity304 ' ( 1980 ) @entity225 national treasure @entity303 does n't mess around with @entity307 whimsy in this straightforward classic that does exactly what it says on the cover			2
it 's called " @entity304 " and it 's about being on the road again			2
hopefully @entity303 is n't driving though			2
after arrests for marijuana and mushroom possession , it 's perhaps better if one of his friends takes the wheel			2
acting fact ii : unlike @entity269 , @entity303 can act			0
not that he needs to in movies like " @entity323			0
@entity324 : ' @entity325 ' ( 1975 ) on the face of it , a rollicking love song for a girl going by the unlikely name of @entity334 , but in truth a desperate anthem about getting the hell out of @entity338 ( in @entity324 's case , @entity340 , @entity224 ) , with the disaffected howl of " we got ta get out while we 're young , ' cause tramps like us , baby we were born to run			1
" career fact : a frustrated @entity324 recorded " @entity325 " as a final effort to hit the big time			1
@entity347 : ' @entity346 ' ( 1968 ) the ultimate open - road song			0
@entity347 's full - throttled cover version would be a perfect checklist for the rock ' n ' roll voyager , if having a checklist was n't so un-rock ' n ' roll			1
" get your motor running " -- check			0
" @entity356 out on the highway " -- check			0
" looking for adventure " -- check			0
mind you , it 's been so worn out over the years that the only people still listening to it are graying oldies whose checklist is more likely to include things like blood - pressure pills , sensible shoes and a hernia truss			2
not - so - wild fact : despite being classed as one of the first heavy metal bands , @entity347 were originally called @entity372			0
does n't quite have the same ring does it ? updated with new songs from a story originally published in 2011 .			2
