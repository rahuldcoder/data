@entity0 -- veterans of @entity0 often refer to nature 's awe - inspiring work as the @entity5			1
the name comes from an early 20th century novel by @entity8 -- reflecting on life in an alpine health retreat , and the mystery of time in this breath - taking setting			2
read more from @entity13 : why @entity15 's transition is so painful since the late 20th century , this ski resort has been synonymous with the @entity17 , which represents networking on its grandest scale			1
this year nearly 40 world leaders -- a record for this annual meeting -- 2000 plus executives and it seems an equal number of people in the media , like yours truly , are in pursuit of them all			0
the setting is certainly more chaotic then a decade ago			0
the agendas of the @entity31 chief executives are to filled with bi-lateral meetings and back door briefings to allow for the spontaneity that made this venue unique			0
i first came to @entity0 as a relatively junior correspondent in 1990 , two months after the fall of the @entity39			1
it was arguably then , after nearly two decades in the conference business , when the forum became a fixture on the global calendar			1
quest : @entity47 economy to dominate @entity0 2013 i can remember , quite vividly , working out of a bunker ( like we do today ) in the @entity50			1
west @entity52 chancellor @entity51 sat side - by - side with his east @entity52 counterpart @entity54			0
that meeting before the global community helped set the stage for monetary union , a huge unification fund for what became @entity61 and shortly thereafter @entity52 elections			0
the early 90s at @entity0 were dominated by @entity65 reconstruction after the fall of communism			1
former party bosses came to the forum to convince business leaders that a transition to market economics could be delivered			2
@entity73 made his @entity0 appearance during that chaotic transition from the @entity76 to today 's @entity77			1
@entity0 2013 : new year , same old problems ? in 1992 , @entity80 premier @entity79 used the setting here in the @entity83 to articulate plans for the country 's economic opening up to the world			1
not by chance , the architect of @entity92 's engagement with @entity93 , the former @entity47 secretary of state @entity88 also took a high profile that year			0
again only two years later in 1994 , @entity96 and @entity97 walked hand in hand on stage , holding a public dialogue leading up to the creation and recognition of the @entity103			0
the @entity17 , as the saying goes , was positioned to be in the right place at the right time			2
while the author of the @entity5 talked about the complexity of time around @entity108 , in the 1990s time was compressed here			0
the fall of communism , the lowering of global trade barriers , the opening up of @entity80 , the removal of apartheid in @entity112 and the proliferation of the internet all unfolded in that decade			1
interactive : how 's your economic mood ? as those events came together , so too did the major players as they made the journey to @entity0			1
@entity123 , evolving as a global name in financial data and now the mayor of @entity127 , sat alongside @entity129 ceo @entity128			0
@entity47 president @entity130 outlined his party 's historic move to the political center before a packed audience of global business executives			2
to spice things up , rock stars and actors , as they became activists , chose the @entity0 platform : @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 would have the wealthiest and most powerful corporate titans freeze in their tracks			2
earlier this week , i walked into the main plenary hall as workers put the final touches on the stage and lighting			0
it is a venue which has welcomed countless political leaders and business executives , during internet booms and banking busts , in the midst of a @entity162 crisis and even during the lead up to two @entity164			0
but that inter-play between geo - politics and business -- during the best and worst of times -- is what keeps the forum relevant			1
it allows this setting at the base of the @entity5 to endure and recreate something unique during what @entity8 rightly described as the ongoing complexity of our times .			0

since the @entity181 , the ski resort of @entity0 has been synonymous with the @entity17
@entity13 : i first came to @entity0 as a relatively junior correspondent , two months after the @entity39 fell
@entity186 , @entity80 's opening , removal of apartheid in @entity112 unfolded in the 90s
it 's the inter-play between geo - politics and business is what keeps the forum relevant
