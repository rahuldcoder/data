-- people talk about all kinds of things on social media : their day - to - day lives , articles generating a lot of buzz and the things they ate for breakfast			0
some of the conversations by @entity12 's 128 million daily users revolve around the news , and @entity0 now has the ability to take a peek into this world			1
@entity12 has given @entity0 access to demographic data that tells us how many people have mentioned a topic along with age , gender and location information			1
we are n't actually reading through conversations , but rather looking at numbers that show us trends			0
since we 've just gotten this information , we thought we 'd try something new			0
each day , we 'll be comparing two topics that show interesting trends in their demographic data			2
you might see that more women are talking about a particular topic than men , or that younger age groups are mentioning one news event versus another			0
while this is n't a scientific study , we hope pitting two topics against each other will give some perspective on these results			2
sometimes , these numbers can show us things we do n't expect			0
for example , we recently learned that many of the @entity12 users talking about @entity51 were young people , especially internationally			1
we also found a similar trend in ages among the people talking about the government shutdown			1
looking at @entity12 mentions can give us insights that would be hard to get in any other way			1
