-- in the early days of the @entity4 , the mantra " information wants to be free " made the rounds			1
in music circles now , " music wants to be shared " seems to be the idea			2
the big record labels now allow fans to play their songs free on social networking sites			1
the big record labels , once more prone to awkward lawsuits against individual file swappers , now allow fans to play their songs free on social networking sites like @entity17 that use music as the social glue			1
and music sharing seems ever more entwined in everyday life , sometimes in subtle ways			0
increasingly for instance it 's easy to " tweet " to others what you 're listening to			1
( a tweet is a post on @entity31 , the micro-blogging site where you can broadcast to followers what you 're doing , in 140 characters or less			1
) for instance @entity38 users can opt to display , next to their names , whatever song they 're playing on @entity42			1
a new site called @entity44 specializes in this , except it calls the tweets about what you 're listening to " blips			1
" just as @entity31 asks , " what are you doing now ? " @entity44 asks : " what are you listening to now ? " then it lets anyone else hear it			0
in effect , you get your own dj space			0
along with the song , you can add a comment about it			2
many users now have hundreds of listeners on their @entity44 page			2
a new service called @entity63 makes it quick and easy to share music			0
just type a song 's name into its search box and it creates tiny urls linking to various sites where that song can be played right now , for free			1
creating a link and emailing it to friends takes seconds			0
@entity75 makes it an easy three - step process to create an email - able postcard combining pictures and songs from your computer			2
music sharing is growing not just online , but in the physical space as well			0
some bars and clubs now have " customer dj " nights , where a customer can dock their ipods into the sound system and play tunes for everyone else			1
copyright lawyers could clamp down on this sort of thing , says @entity96 , an analyst with research firm @entity97			0
businesses that play music to a crowd are supposed to pay a performance royalty to @entity102 , @entity103 or one of the other performance - rights organizations			2
but they 're not likely to , says @entity106 : " nobody will bother about that unless and until the clubs engaging in this become really popular			1
" a startup called @entity112 has an interesting approach to bringing music - sharing to the real world			0
earphone manufacturers can incorporate jook technology			0
with @entity112 - enabled earphones , you can broadcast what you 're playing ( @entity122 mode ) , and then others sitting nearby can listen in ( @entity125 mode )			1
you 'll know that they 're listening to your songs by the green indicator light on their earphone cable 's @entity129 , and they 'll know that you 're broadcasting by the red light on yours			1
jook is platform - independent , so it works even if you have an @entity137 from @entity138 and your listener has a @entity140 from @entity141			0
" jook did something amazing by just saying , ' let 's put this social media connection on the lanyard , make it cheap and make it multiplatform , ' " says @entity142 , a strategist with consumer trends research firm @entity143			2
the way people discover music , he notes , has changed			0
it 's no longer from a music nerd behind a counter , a la @entity158 in the movie " @entity160			0
" anyone now can be that music nerd -- and there are ever more ways to share the music .			0
