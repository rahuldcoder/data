speaking to the nation after @entity2 reached a deal to reopen the government and temporarily raise the debt ceiling , president @entity0 said we are " @entity9 first " and need to put partisan interests aside to get things done			1
but can we ? the recent shenanigans do not bode well for the future			0
the resolution of the shutdown always hinged on whether house speaker @entity14 , a @entity15 , would defy the @entity16 hard - liners in his party and allow a vote on a bill that a majority of @entity15 did not support			1
what have we learned about @entity14 's leadership , or lack thereof ? we are already hearing two extreme viewpoints			1
rep. @entity26 and other staunch conservatives and tea party members gave him kudos			2
@entity14 's job as speaker of the @entity33 seems safe , at least for now			1
but others in the @entity15 , and outside of it , say @entity14 needs to grow a spine to stand up against the tea party caucus and sen. @entity37 , the ultimate architect of the shutdown fiasco of 2013			1
such differing views about the role @entity14 played and how he led his troops reflects the exact polarization that produced the fingernails - to - the - chalkboard tension that caused the shutdown face - off in the first place			2
@entity15 , @entity14 take shutdown hit in new @entity50 poll in press conferences and tv appearances , @entity37 and @entity33 tea party members said time and time again that they were doing what the " @entity9 people " asked them to do			1
they talked about those who cheered on the government shutdown to get rid of the @entity58			0
but polls say most @entity9 disapproved of the @entity15 tactics and did not want the government to shut down over @entity58			2
these @entity9 give a historically low disapproval rating to @entity15 and the tea party in particular			1
those same numbers give @entity0 and the @entity66 confidence in saying they are the ones who are actually listening to the @entity9 people			0
the problem for @entity14 as a leader of a fractured caucus is that he is listening to only a small but loud fraction of the @entity9 electorate			2
the voices of this @entity9 are vengeful if they do n't get their way			0
and their leaders were clearly able to compel @entity14 to rebuff the other more mainstream and moderate @entity9 that seeks compromise and resolution			1
so did @entity14 display good leadership ? for his tea party caucus , yes			1
for the country , no. and yet , going to the mat for the tea party might enable @entity14 to push them hard to avoid this destructive path next time			1
it might give him the backbone he will need to stand up to them in the coming months and listen to the other " @entity9 " that represents more reasonable middle - of - the - road voices			0
these also happen to be a majority of the country -- republicans , @entity66 and independents			0
they are the voters that decide presidential elections and are precisely the ones the tea party is alienating			2
a defeated @entity15 wants to unite , move on , fight another day the bigger problem for moderate and pragmatic @entity15 is that the tea party does n't care about the @entity15 's shrinking @entity33 prospects			1
but it does care about its own and about keeping control of the @entity102			0
this could be enough to get the tea party to rethink its strategy			2
the most recent @entity50 poll shows 54 % of @entity9 think it is a bad thing for the country that the @entity15 controls @entity2			0
for the first time ever , polls show 60 % of voters are ready to boot all of @entity2 out -- including their own representatives			0
while many strategists believe the @entity33 is still safe for @entity15 , a recent @entity113 survey , conducted by the @entity66 pollster for @entity115 , a liberal activist group , suggests that the @entity66 in competitive @entity15 districts are ahead			0
and @entity66 need only to flip 17 districts to gain control of the @entity33			0
there are 17 districts held by @entity15 that @entity0 won in 2012			0
there are 17 districts held by republicans where @entity0 lost by 2 points or less			0
these are districts where because of @entity14 's poor leadership anti-tea party backlash could help @entity66 win seats			1
@entity14 's leadership will soon be tested yet again -- on immigration , the farm bill and the budget , the three issues that @entity0 says he will push in the remainder of his term			1
he can choose to be a strong leader for the tea party , or be a strong leader for the country , truly work with @entity0 and the @entity66 , and help heal the battered image of his party and of @entity142			2
he can seal his fate as a true leader , or as the captain of the @entity146 .			0

@entity148 : shutdown resolution hinged on whether @entity14 would defy tea party
she says @entity14 's job appears safe , but some question his leadership
she says he seems to *ignore* interests of @entity9 in favor of tea party , a losing *proposition*
@entity148 : @entity14 must lead if he wants to save @entity163 districts that appear *vulnerable*
