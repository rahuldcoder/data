@entity1 , @entity2 -- " i feel a deep sense of regret , i could n't protect my own child , " @entity0 said			1
" he had to go out on the street to work			1
" as she speaks , she cradles her youngest child , rocking slowly back and forth			2
she used to have another son , 9 - year - old @entity10			2
he sang in the streets for money , like many impoverished children			1
one day in january , @entity10 's 5 - year - old brother came back home without him			1
a few hours later , @entity16 heard horrifying news about a mutilated child : authorities were trying to locate the head			2
she instantly knew something was wrong with @entity10			0
" i asked some guy on the street if he knows how old this mutilated kid was			1
i was crying when i asked the question , " she said			0
" i started looking around under the bridge trying to find the head of this child , " she said			0
" i told my husband , this mutilated kid is our son			0
i did n't know for sure , but my heart was just telling me that it was my son			0
i kept saying ' where 's the head , where 's the head ' as i search through the grass			1
" the investigation led the police to a middle - aged cigarette vendor -- @entity43			1
police say he confessed to everything			1
" he had asked @entity10 to have sex with him , " said police spokesman @entity47			1
" when @entity10 refused , he got angry and strangled him			0
he sodomized @entity51 after he killed him			0
" @entity10 was not the only victim			0
authorities say he confessed to raping and murdering at least 14 boys dating back to 1995			1
@entity56 's lawyer said he will not contest the charges			1
@entity56 was no stranger to the community or his victims			0
he was nicknamed " @entity62 " -- which means father -- and was known for his kindness toward street children			1
he would regularly bring them in off the streets , provide them a comfortable place to sleep and eat			1
no one suspected that this fatherly figure would be the same man police say was a serial rapist and murderer			1
this case has shocked the @entity2 capital because serial killings , especially those involving children , are rare			0
but it has catapulted the plight of the estimated 12,000 street kids in @entity1 into public view			1
" ninety percent of the time the reason these kids end up on the street is the parents ' financial condition , " said @entity83 , who owns a shelter for street children			1
" rarely do we find parents intentionally sending their kids to the street			1
they have no other choice but to have their kids fend for themselves			1
" at @entity83 's shelter , a group of boys jams on a drum set and a couple of old guitars			1

" i met a lot of my friends there			0

he said @entity118 never molested him , but he was approached by numerous others on the street			2
the boys at the shelter say they were shocked and terrified when they found out what happened to @entity10			2
@entity83 said the problem is that @entity2 street children are especially vulnerable since there are no laws to protect them			2
someone like @entity118 can set up a make shift shelter and not be questioned by the community or the police			2
" we do n't want to ban people from trying to go good , " he said			0
" but the government needs to set some sort of a regulation for this kind of activity			0
