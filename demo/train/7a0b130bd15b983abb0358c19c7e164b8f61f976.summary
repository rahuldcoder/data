-- extreme natural events , not man - made climate change , led to last summer 's historic drought in the @entity5 , a new federal study said friday			1
drought occurred in six plains states between last may and august because moist @entity10 air " failed to stream northward in late spring , " and summer storms were few and stingy with rainfall , said a report by the @entity14			1
" neither ocean states nor human - induced climate change , factors that can provide long - lead predictability , appeared to play significant roles in causing severe rainfall deficits over the major corn - producing regions of central @entity5 , " the report summary said			1
the drought in @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 was the worst since record keeping began in 1895 , even eclipsing the notorious @entity32 droughts of 1934 and 1936 , said study leader @entity33 , a @entity14 meteorologist			1
" the event was rare , and we estimated maybe a once in a couple of hundred years event , " @entity33 said			0
" but for as extreme as it was , it did n't have any strong indications for early warning			2
" it 's highly unlikely that this upcoming may to august will be as dry as last year 's , " he said , referring to the six states			2
although he believes in global warming , @entity33 said greenhouse gas concentrations were n't behind the heat wave in the @entity49 region			2
" i 'm an advocate of global warming because science tells me that greenhouse gases have warmed the planet by about 1 degree @entity54 in the last 100 years			0
so there 's no question about that , " he said			2
" but the science also tells that every drought that 's occurring is n't a result of climate change			1
" last summer 's dryness had caused at least $ 12 billion in economic losses , as of last july , before the drought peaked , the study said			1
crop yields and commerce on major rivers fell during the sweltering weather , the report said			0
" it remains to be seen if the economic effects of the 2012 drought will approach prior events , including the 1988 drought that inflicted $ 78 billion in losses and the 1980 event that caused $ 56 billion in losses ( adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars ) , " the report said			0
the study was prepared by 20 scientists from several universities and @entity14			0
" it was highly vetted through a review process , " @entity33 said of the study			0
a climate scientist disputed the study 's findings and said it failed to address the role of global warming in an appropriate way			1
" the analysis failed to take account of the record low snow pack in the @entity97 , the development of the drought there and the record high temperatures , the inadequacies of the models used , or why there was no monsoon , " said @entity91 of the @entity92 , a federally funded facility			0
" we know that drought forms naturally , but the role of global warming , via the extra heat available ... is to increase the intensity of the drought , and thus the subsequent heat waves and wildfire risk , " @entity91 said			0
" the study does not answer why there were so any records broken last year throughout the @entity117 " major snow disappoints with minor moisture hundreds of @entity117 counties labeled disaster areas due to drought 2012 broke @entity117 heat records how severe weather affects food supply			1

new : climate scientist disputes study findings
" every drought that 's occurring is n't a result of climate change , " *author* says
study found a lack of moist air from @entity10 and " severe rainfall deficits "
the drought in six @entity5 states was the worst since records began in 1895
