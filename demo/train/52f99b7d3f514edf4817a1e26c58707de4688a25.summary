@entity0 -- the @entity2 has struck down a federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfights and other acts of animal cruelty , saying it is an unconstitutional violation of free speech			1
the 8 - 1 decision was a defeat for animal rights groups and congressional sponsors of the unusual legislation			1
the specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bulldogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations			0
the justices tuesday concluded the scope and intent of the decade - old statute was overly broad			1
" @entity28 itself reflects a judgment by the @entity32 people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh its costs , " said chief justice @entity27			0
he concluded @entity38 had not sufficiently shown " depictions " of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection			1
the high court threw out the conviction of @entity46 , a @entity47 , @entity48 , man who sold videos through his business , @entity51			1
according to court records , undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in @entity56 , an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting			0
" this is what i was hoping for , " @entity46 told @entity1 just after the ruling was announced			1
" i am not nor have i ever been a dog fighter or a promoter of dogfighting			0
i am a journalist and an author			0
" among the products @entity46 advertised was " @entity75 , " featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a " gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig , " according to the @entity72 , @entity73 - based appeals court that ruled on the case earlier			1
@entity46 was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty			1
he was later sentenced to 37 months in prison , and promptly appealed			0
that sentence was put on hold pending resolution of this appeal			0
he argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player @entity85 , who ran an illegal dogfighting ring			0
it was the first prosecution in the @entity32 to proceed to trial under the 1999 law			0
the video marketer is not related to justice @entity91 , who turned 90 tuesday			0
the court made no mention of the milestone as it held a two - hour public session			0
nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals , and usually handle prosecutions of animal cruelty			1
several media organizations had supported @entity46 , worrying the federal law could implicate reports about deer hunting , and depictions of bullfighting in @entity111 novels			1
@entity27 agreed , saying , " we read [ the federal law ] to create a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth			0
" " jurisdictions permit and encourage hunting , and there is an enormous national market for hunting - related depictions in which a living animal is intentionally killed , " said @entity27			1
" an otherwise - lawful image of any of these practices , if sold or possessed for commercial gain within a state that happens to forbid the practice , falls within the prohibition of [ the federal law ]			1
" during oral arguments in october , the justices offered a number of wide - ranging hypotheticals over what the law could forbid , including : fox hunts , @entity135 from geese , cockfighting , bullfighting , shooting deer out of season , even @entity142 gladiator battles			1
only justice @entity153 dissented in the case , and he focused on one of the most disturbing aspects raised in the appeal , the marketing of so - called " crush " videos , in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked - heel shoes or with their bare feet			2
" the animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain			2
our society has long banned such cruelty , " he said			2
the courts , he said , have " erred in second - guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals			2
" he predicted mores crush videos will soon flood the underground market , because the ruling has " the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos			2
" @entity27 suggested a law specifically banning crush videos might be valid , since it would be narrowly tailored to a specific type of commercial enterprise			1
@entity153 noted that would not help dogs forced to fight each other , where , he said , " the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes			0
" the government had argued a " compelling interest " in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions			2
@entity27 dismissed suggestions by the @entity191 that only the most extreme acts of cruelty would be targeted			2
" @entity28 protects against the government , " @entity27 said			0
" we would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promised to use it responsibly			2
" the @entity199 , other animal rights groups and 26 states backed the government			0
if the law had been upheld , it would have been only the second time the @entity2 had identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the @entity28			1
the justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography			0
this is the second time this year the high court has tossed out federal legislation on free speech grounds			1
the justices in january nullified parts of a sweeping campaign finance reform law , giving corporations , unions , and advocacy groups more power to bankroll federal elections .			0
