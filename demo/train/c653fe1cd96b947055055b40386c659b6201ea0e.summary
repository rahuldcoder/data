@entity15 , the man they allegedly attacked , meanwhile remains hospitalized in a @entity34 hospital , recovering from extensive brain and other trauma			1
police said the 42 - year - old paramedic from @entity39 , a @entity41 fan , was attacked by two men in the parking lot of the @entity45 stadium after the opening game of the @entity45 and @entity41 seasons			1
unprovoked , the men began to kick and punch @entity15 , yelling profanities about the @entity41 , before heading off in a car driven by a woman , police said			1
@entity15 's mother , @entity53 , said that her son was first hit from behind , at which point he fell and his head hit the concrete			1
" it was just a brutal attack , " she said			2
" whatever that guy hit my son with , @entity15 was unconscious before he hit the ground , so he had no way to protect his head			1
" @entity15 was placed in a medically induced coma following the incident			1
he underwent emergency surgery monday morning at @entity68 , precipitated by " massive amounts of fluid building up that caused a 30 - second seizure , " his family said on their website			0
by friday , though , the family said that @entity15 's condition had improved and he appeared " very alert " -- able to open and close his eyes on command , move his right hand and mouth his last name to medical staff			2

@entity0 authorities announced then that they had arrested @entity93 , 31 , because they believed he was the " primary aggressor " in the attack			2
@entity93 , a documented gang member associated with the @entity97 street gang in @entity98 , was then ordered jailed on $ 1 million bail			0
on june 20 , he was ordered to serve 10 months -- a term that can not be reduced -- for violating parole related to a 2005 conviction for possession of a firearm , @entity101 's @entity100 said in a press release			0
he previously had been convicted in 1998 for robbery , court records show			0
but a second charge related to @entity15 's assault was dropped " without prejudice " on that same date " due to the lack of the evidence presented on that charge , " the corrections department statement said			1
@entity27 said friday that @entity93 was exonerated as a result of the continuing investigation , adding that police met a " burden of proof " required to arrest him , but not to proceed with a criminal case			2
he conceded that the backtracking may not help police credibility , but said it is " just as important that we find out the innocent that we find the guilty			0
" " what this investigation speaks to is that we do the right thing , even when it 's the hard thing , " @entity27 said			0
" this is about the character of the police department ... even when it reflects badly on us			0
