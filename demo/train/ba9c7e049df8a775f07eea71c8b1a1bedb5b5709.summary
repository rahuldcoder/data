a 29 - year - old who admitted leaking details of a secret @entity3 government program that collects massive phone and @entity6 data now says he does n't want attention			0
you 're getting it -- on every scale , good and bad , across the internet on social media and on every news broadcast			0
people of every age and range of experience , including national security experts , are weighing in on what you 've done			0
some love you , others despise you			0
you 're now a lightning rod for spirited debate surrounding government transparency versus public protection against the threat of terrorism			2
like @entity32 ' source @entity31 , now on trial for leaking secrets , @entity9 said he independently decided that the program was counter to @entity3 principles and should be revealed			1
" there is no public oversight , " he told the @entity38 newspaper			1
like @entity31 , he went outside the system , and critics are blasting the computer expert for not airing concerns internally			1
@entity9 's actions have united some strange bedfellows			1
left - leaning filmmaker @entity47 and right - leaning commentator @entity48 tweeted that they think he 's a " hero			1
" @entity51 senators @entity52 of @entity53 and @entity54 of @entity55 and @entity56 sen. @entity56 of @entity57 say they 're worried the government could be overreaching with the program			0
@entity60 lists @entity9 as contributing to the 2012 presidential campaign of @entity56 's father , libertarian @entity62			1
dozens of @entity65 pages supporting @entity9 have popped up in the past day			1
there are at least 2 million mentions of the @entity68 native on @entity69			0
comments are so wide - ranging it 's hard to put a finger on one theme , but social media aggregator @entity74 says that the word " hero " pops up more on @entity69 than " traitor			1
" @entity9 's strongest critics are using terrorism and incidents like the @entity83 bombings and 9/11 to explain why government monitoring is necessary to head off attacks			1
they say he should have kept what he was working on quiet to protect the public			0
some added that they do n't mind being watched			0
if they are doing nothing wrong , they argue , then they have nothing to fear from a monitoring program			0
for all anyone knows , @entity9 might have been taking all this in monday through his laptop in his hotel room in @entity97			1
on sunday , he outted himself a @entity38 video interview			1
he must have known the stakes ; after the first reports in the @entity38 , the @entity100 said it was beginning a criminal investigation into the leak			1
on sunday , @entity9 told the newspaper , " i have no intention of hiding who i am because i know i have done nothing wrong			1
" @entity9 told the newspaper that while he admires @entity31 and @entity108 , famous for leaking the @entity109 during the @entity110 , he considers himself different from @entity31 because he " carefully evaluated every single document " to " ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest			1
" " there are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that i did n't turn over , because harming people is n't my goal , " he said			0
" but no matter his intention , he says he 's paying a price			2
the newspaper gave details of his comfortable life before he became a leaker , saying that he walked away from a $ 200,000 job for @entity128 , which let him work from his @entity130 home			2
@entity128 is a private consulting firm the government contracted to work on the program			0
afraid the government would come after him , the paper said , he told his girlfriend he had to go away for a bit and has been living in a hotel room and stuffing pillows under his door to thwart eavesdroppers			2
staying at the hotel is expensive enough , the @entity38 said , but room service is killing him			1
@entity9 is hoping a country will offer him political asylum -- a wish reminiscent of notorious @entity32 founder @entity146			1
like @entity146 , @entity9 may be already on a path to cult status			1
" yeah , man , going to try and get this page big and then get donations for his lawyers , " wrote @entity149 on one of many @entity65 pages supporting @entity9			1
" very courageous what this man has done , " @entity149 wrote , on a site with more than 1,000 " likes			0
" the focus should n't be on @entity9 , another page argued			1
" it 's not about the government seeing who i call or what you @entity167 , " @entity65 poster @entity162 wrote			1
" this is about our government becoming an evil empire			0
" there are several @entity176 pages , too			2
@entity177 wrote that he supports sanctions against any nation that grants @entity9 asylum			1
" his alleged actions are not a political issue but rather a serious criminal matter for which the @entity3 has the right to prosecute even if it means bringing the matter before the @entity186 in the @entity187			2
" by noon monday , @entity189 's story on @entity9 had generated nearly 10,700 comments			1
some commenters are citing the @entity83 bombings and 9/11 to justify government monitoring			0
@entity194 said she was " impressed " with @entity9 but " when people found out the @entity197 had been under surveillance by the @entity199 , people demanded to know why more had n't been done			1
" so how do you want it , people ? you ca n't have it both ways			0
" @entity9 's actions are not tantamount to spying or aiding the enemy , argued a @entity189 commenter " @entity209			1
" " it 's one thing to expose national secrets that are meant for foreign espionage			2
that said , this man exposed a secret spying operation on @entity3 citizens - both innocent and otherwise			0
we have a constitutional right against such intrusions			0
that 's not traitorous ... " i am all for punishing people who expose national secrets			2
i am very against the whole concept of @entity32			0
exposing the government 's violation of our constitutional rights is contextually the opposite of treason			2
" some readers suggested those outraged by the government 's program are being naive about terrorists			2
" you 'd prefer that terrorists operate in comfort with the knowledge that you 'll be fighting for their privacy ? " @entity246 in @entity247 said			0
" why would you not want the @entity3 government to be able to have all the information it can have when it comes to protecting itself and its people ? " @entity258 shot back , " the threat of terrorism does not justify abandoning constitutional principals ( sic ) ... the invasion of privacy of millions without any reasonable suspicion for the vast majority			0
" while observers continued to debate , a person with a unique understanding of the situation appeared on @entity189 monday morning			0
former @entity199 agent @entity266 gained notoriety in 2002 when a scathing memo she wrote about the agency became public			0
she criticized the @entity199 for mishandling the investigation of terrorism suspect @entity271 before the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			0
@entity266 said top bureau officials stymied a wider investigation into @entity271 , then held in @entity275 on immigration charges			0
she also accused @entity199 officials of acting to " circle the wagons " after the attacks on @entity280 and @entity281			0
@entity271 was later charged as a conspirator in those attacks , which killed more than 3,000 people			0
@entity266 was one of three whistle - blowers featured as @entity288 's @entity287 in december 2002			2
" i 'm sure ( @entity9 ) has a healthy awareness of the bumpy road ahead of him , " @entity266 said , adding that she felt it was " sad " that " @entity3 truth tellers " have to go to another country			2
but @entity266 worked within the system , and that 's what she says separates her from @entity9			1
what do you think ? was @entity9 right to leak ? tell us below .			2

dozens of @entity65 pages support or criticize the @entity305 leaker
some say he 's a hero *championing* transparency ; others call him a traitor
@entity9 's actions have united strange bedfellows
@entity9 told the @entity38 he admires @entity31 but he 's different
