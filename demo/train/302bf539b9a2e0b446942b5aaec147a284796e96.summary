-- if a grown man likes to dress up and pretend he 's a @entity2 killer , is that a problem ? one candidate in @entity7 's upcoming @entity6 elections acknowledges the satisfaction he gets from historical re-enactments , drawing attention to both a strange subculture and a surprising twist in @entity14 politics			1
" the whole purpose of re-enacting is educating people , " @entity15 , a @entity14 candidate in the state of @entity17 said this week			1
" this is just another way to communicate a story and keep alive the history of @entity24			0
" the history of @entity24 is just one of several conflicts that @entity15 says he helped imitate as costume - drama he could enjoy with his son			1
in that role , he assumed the identity of " @entity32 , " a fictitious member of a real division of the @entity35 , the armed wing of the @entity36			1
@entity15 's adopted unit was accused of war crimes and once included infamous sadist @entity39 in its ranks			1
though re-enactments are fairly common in @entity7 , this kind of @entity2 playtime is an unusual way for am @entity7 parent to raise a child			1
@entity14 @entity47 , a @entity48 lawmaker who is one of the party 's most powerful members of @entity6 , quickly condemned it			2
" i would absolutely repudiate that and not support an individual who would do something like that , " @entity47 said			0
military re-enactment is , to be sure , a popular hobby that appeals to people far beyond @entity7 borders			2
@entity61 history buffs re-fight wars of the 17th century			0
@entity64 enthusiasts stage the @entity65 every year , predictably punishing @entity66 every time			0
( one of them fired the blanks in his gunpowder pistol close enough to @entity0 correspondent @entity71 to damage his hearing )			0
but re-enactment may be most popular in the @entity7 , where devotees gather just about every weekend with the distinctive weapons and garb of the @entity77 , enjoying or ignoring the gaze of quizzical onlookers on the sidelines			2
a lot of @entity7 are watching from the sidelines now because @entity15 , an @entity17 businessman making his first attempt at elected office , has joined a growing list of candidates with surprises swirling around them			1
several of them are favorites of the @entity90 , an anti-incumbent insurgency that is growing , mostly among @entity14			1
it is precisely because the @entity90 supports new , untested candidates that some of them have startled the public			2
@entity97 hopeful @entity96 is a self - described religious conservative who acknowledged that she once " dabbled in witchcraft			1
" she is now broadcasting advertisements with an unusual campaign pitch : " i am not a witch			0
" @entity104 , a candidate for governor of @entity106 , was quickly dubbed " @entity111 " in the press for intemperate outbursts and the angry tone of his campaign			1
he publicly threatened to " take out " a troublesome reporter , using colorful slang to suggest physical assault or worse			0
but @entity115 have nominated a strange candidate of their own : an unemployed and previously unknown figure named @entity118 , the party 's nominee for the @entity97 in @entity120 , whose most remarkable attribute is that he is being prosecuted on pornography charges			2
they 're the kind of personalities that pop up in @entity7 public life from time to time , making the @entity7 seem as much an oversized circus as a super-power			1
you never have to wait long for the next memorable performance			0
but there are limits to what the audience will accept			0
@entity7 's conservatives really are conservative after all , and its liberals invented a concept called " @entity140 " to set their own standards for appropriate talk and behavior			2
this is a testy time in @entity7 life , with all kinds of candidates emerging to express discontent with the country 's political class			1
one of them is denying she was ever really involved in the occult			0
another is trying to distance himself from some dirty pictures			0
now that we 've been introduced to an unapologetic @entity2 imitator , you can only wonder who 's next .			0
