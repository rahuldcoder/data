-- the bombing of the @entity2 has been described by some as another wake - up call			2
regrettably , it seems we 've hit the snooze button too many times to say that this time we 've really woken up			0
our vulnerability to attacks such as the one at the marathon has been well known for some time			1
we have long been concerned that attackers would focus on soft targets in which many people gather in open and easily accessible areas			0
moreover , these targets lack the sophisticated security measures that one would find at a chemical plant or federal building			0
improvised explosive devices , or @entity20 , are one of the biggest threats to the @entity23			1
the bombs used in the @entity2 cost less than $ 100 to make from materials that can be commonly purchased and with instructions found on the @entity27			0
opinion : do n't ignore the threat of @entity20 lt. gen. @entity30 , director of the @entity31 at the @entity32 , stated in his july 2012 testimony before the @entity23 @entity34 that : " it is clear the ied is the primary weapon of choice for threat networks globally and is one of the enduring operational and domestic security challenges for the foreseeable future			1
... the domestic @entity20 threat from both homegrown extremists and global threat networks is real and presents a significant security challenge for the @entity23 and our international partners			1
" the @entity48 was about as well prepared to address this threat as any police department could be			0
@entity51 has had a number of high profile events in the past years to be ready for unexpected events			0
the city has received millions of dollars in homeland security grants and the police force recently conducted a @entity59 sponsored multijurisdiction ied training program			0
still , at least two suspects were able to exploit the vulnerability of the marathon			2
the important questions now are not just who was responsible for the attack , but how can we prevent similar attacks ? we have to concede that it takes money and resources to prevent and fight attacks			1
but it 's harder in this belt - tightening time			0
for example , the budget for the @entity74 , a @entity59 office charged with the mission of leading the department 's " efforts to implement the @entity77 and enhance the nation 's ability to prevent , protect against , respond to , and mitigate the terrorist use of explosives ... , " has had its budget cut or reallocated with rumors of further cuts in 2014			1
to be fair , the @entity74 is n't the only federal entity that deals with ieds			1
the @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 all have efforts aimed at helping the private sector and law enforcement agencies prevent ied attacks			1
however , the @entity74 has an important mission of enhancing counter-ied capabilities through coordination of bombing prevention efforts			1
rather than cutting its budget , we should increase it			2
@entity30 's department requested a $ 1.9 billion budget for 2013			2
it is a highly effective organization that saved many lives through the use of intelligence , technology and equipment in @entity112 and @entity113			0
now that we have withdrawn from @entity113 and will be doing so from @entity112 , we should reallocate some of those resources to focus on domestic threats and to prevent attacks at home			1
ieds are a low - cost high - consequence type of weapon that will take significant financial and personnel resources to defeat			2
the alternative will be the loss of more lives and millions of dollars in investigative and recovery efforts if more attacks happen			0
we need to increase the @entity129 budget so we can train state and local law enforcement and private sector security , because they are the front line in our defense			1
above all , we should never submit to the fear that deranged minds may attempt to instill in us			0
the people of this country are too strong and resilient to ever cower before acts of terrorism			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			2

@entity145 : improvised explosive devices are one of the biggest threats to the @entity23
@entity143 : how can we prevent attacks like the marathon bombing ?
he says one way is to increase the budget for the @entity74
@entity143 : the resources will help train those who are on the front line of defense
