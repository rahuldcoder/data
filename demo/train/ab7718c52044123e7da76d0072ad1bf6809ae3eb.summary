@entity3 -- " let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us			1
the ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a president and senators and congressmen and government officials , but the voters of this country			1
" -- @entity13 when i began the @entity17 fan page " join the @entity15 , " i had no idea what would transpire			1
it was about 1:30 a.m. january 26 , and i was very frustrated with the endless news coverage about the @entity22 and the growing narrative that it represented @entity24			1
i was driven by a question , a curiosity : if i build it , will they come ? would anyone respond to my call for civility in our political discourse and cooperation in government ? first they came virtually			1
more than 155,000 joined the fan page in less than six weeks			0
but were they real people ? inside a town hall meeting room in @entity40 , @entity41 , last saturday morning , and then at @entity42 in @entity3 that afternoon , i had an answer to my questions			0
in @entity40 , two dozen people came , ten of them veterans			0
in @entity3 , a hundred people came			0
in all , we had reports of more than 350 events held for " @entity51 " in at least 44 states ; even @entity24 living abroad gathered in @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
people from all walks of life and all political dispositions sat together as fellow @entity24 to discuss their concerns about our politics : accountability , corporate influence , health care reform , education reform , the economy , immigration reform , filibusters , etc. there was a generally shared anxiety for many that corporations were gaming the political process			1
there was passion and excitement about what the @entity15 could become politically and personally			1
here was a chance for people to have a voice in our government and hope in our future			1
in just a few weeks , the @entity17 page had become a town square where people could meet , talk , learn , engage , share , serve and be part of a community			1
all day saturday , messages and reports were sent directly to @entity15 organizers and left on the @entity17 fan page from across the country , " the event exceeded my expectations ... i was expecting 20 people and a hundred showed up ... we ca n't wait to meet again ... it was amazing			1
i was surprised that we were able to sit and have a civil conversation with a @entity22 member ... i do n't feel alone now ... " what is going on ? it seems to me that the @entity15 members are a silent and extremely frustrated majority only too happy to find one another			1
over the course of many years , @entity24 have grown accustomed to thinking of two - party politics as a kind of a zero - sum game			0
if one team wins , the other team loses			0
the game framework encourages many @entity24 to be spectators passively watching professional politicians go at each other			0
furthermore , it invites people to " game " the process to advance their personal or partisan agendas			1
in @entity3 , recently the tactics have become so vicious that the game looks more like @entity125			0
the game framework is not an intrinsic quality of democracy			2
in fact , it is inconsistent with the basic tenets of democracy			2
democracy presupposes a community of people deliberating , through their elected representatives , to advance the common good -- a method of collective decision - making			2
when we regard politics as a game , we all lose			0
because when it comes down to it , politics is about all of our futures			0
in @entity24 , we have a democracy , but with vulnerabilities and loopholes			2
one loophole is that the most active and organized constituents have disproportionate influence over our government			2
for instance , corporations can afford to pay thousands of lobbyists to work full - time at doing this			0
this gives them a disproportionate influence over our government and presents a serious challenge to democracy in @entity24			1
this is really at the root of our discontent : our government 's relationship to corporate @entity24 and this special interest seems altogether unconstitutional			1
as the @entity172 dictates , we want a government of the people , by the people , for the people			2
@entity177 is a democracy movement , and our goal is to have the government truly reflect the will of the people			1
how do we restore the primacy of ordinary people in our government ? we can find immediate institutional solutions -- for example , changing @entity188 rules and procedures that impede government , countering misinformation and promoting campaign finance reform and term limits			2
there is a profound relationship problem between the government and the people that it serves			2
many @entity24 feel alienated from the corrupted political process , the dysfunction of the government and the seeming polarization of our society			1
the health care debate and the spectacle of the august town halls laid open all that alienation and despair			0
since august , many of us chose to cocoon in our homes , growing more frustrated and outraged over our diseased political system			2
this is a terrible state of affairs because the public 's disengagement from politics is the greatest threat to a democracy			1
we are proposing to address this threat , to practice democracy at the local level and create a home in the public sphere			2
what better place than a neighborhood coffee shop to create that home ? there are three steps to this model of participatory democracy			0
the first step is creating a public space for open and civil dialogue			0
the second step is collective deliberation , considering facts and values to arrive at a decision			0
the third step is working toward implementing the decision			0
we will practice all three steps as a community , pledging to be civil to each other			0
our next national event is the " @entity243 " on the weekend of march 27 , coming to a coffee shop near you -- followed by " @entity246 " during the april congressional recess			0
we will be asking our representatives to sit down with us over coffee			0
you are all invited to join us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .			1
