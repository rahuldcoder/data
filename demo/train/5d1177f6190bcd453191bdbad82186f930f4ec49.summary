-- the pings detected by the crew aboard an @entity4 navy ship in the southern @entity5 have given those searching for @entity7 renewed hopes of finding the missing plane			1
@entity4 officials leading the search said the signals picked up sunday were consistent with those transmitted by an aircraft 's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder			1
but the officials warned that they still need further evidence , such as a visual sighting of wreckage on the seafloor			2
" there are many steps yet before these detections can be positively verified as being from missing @entity7 , " @entity21 , the head of the @entity4 agency coordinating search operations , said monday			1
here 's an explanation of what the next phases are in the underwater hunt for traces of the passenger jet			2
do searchers have enough pings to figure out where they 're coming from ? no , not yet			2
the @entity35 , an @entity4 navy ship that 's slowly towing a pinger locator through the water , is going back and forth over the area where it twice picked up a signal sunday			1
" the focus is on trying to reacquire the acoustic signal they had 24 hours ago , " said commodore @entity41 , who is coordinating military contributions to the search			1
as of monday morning , the high - tech pinger locator , supplied by the @entity49 , had n't redetected the pings , officials said			0
" probably for the next 24 hours , @entity35 will continue its runs back and forth over the area , " @entity21 said			0
why is it crisscrossing the same area ? the aim is to use triangulation to pinpoint the location of whatever is transmitting the pings , according to @entity60			1
@entity61 of the @entity63 @entity62			0
" for us in the @entity49 , this is kind of our bread and butter , " he told @entity0			0
the crew of the ship does this by towing the pinger locator along a series of intersecting lines across a relatively small area of ocean			1
if the sound is picked up along three different lines that cross at the same point , " that 's a pretty positive indication of where the signal 's coming from , " @entity61 said			1
but it 's a slow and painstaking business			0
by the end of its runs tuesday , @entity35 expects to have thoroughly covered only a 3 - mile - by - 3 - mile box , according to @entity41			0
each run across the area takes the ship seven to eight hours			1
that 's because it 's moving slowly -- at about 3 knots ( 3.5 mph ) -- and because turning around with the huge length of cable that 's dragging the pinger locator through the ocean depths is a delicate , drawn - out process			0
what happens if they pick up another signal in that area ? at that point , they will deploy an unmanned underwater vehicle that 's on board the @entity35 , the @entity103			1
the vehicle , also from the @entity63 , is able to generate maps of the bottom of the ocean and " determine if there 's something unusual on the seafloor , like aircraft wreckage , " said @entity21			2
" in the event of finding something unusual , the autonomous vehicle will come back to the surface and will then be fitted with a camera , " he said			0
" and hopefully , we would then be able to pick up imagery			0
" but one potential problem is that the water in the area the @entity35 is searching is about 4,500 meters ( 14,800 feet ) deep , the limit of the @entity103 's range			2
" we 're right on the edge of capability , " @entity21 said			0
if the area of the seabed where the pings are coming from is any deeper , then the search crews would need remotely operated vehicles that can go even farther down			1
@entity21 said officials are looking into what other vehicles could be deployed , if needed			0
what if they do n't pick up another signal ? if the pings the @entity35 's crew have detected are from flight 370 , they could cease at any moment			2
the batteries powering the locator beacons on the missing plane 's flight recorders could already have expired			0
at the very most , they could last another week or so			0
without another signal , the members of the search team will have to take a look at what information they have been able to gather			2
" if we 're unable to fix the location , the people who are out there have to do an analysis of everything they 've got and make an assessment of whether they would deploy the underwater vehicle in the most likely area , " @entity21 said			1
" i would anticipate that 's what will happen : the underwater vehicle will be deployed and continue the work , " he said			1
but that would mean searchers have far less precision than they would hope to have when searching waters so deep			0
" if we have a large area of uncertainty , it will take several days to actually cover what would appear to be a fairly small area , " @entity21 said			1
" things happen very slowly at the depths we 're dealing with			0

an @entity4 navy ship is expected to keep searching a small area into tuesday
it is trying to regain a signal that it picked up sunday that could be from @entity7
if it detects the pings again , it will deploy an underwater vehicle that can look for wreckage
without a new signal , the possible area will be larger and take longer to search
