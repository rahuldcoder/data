-- @entity2 police have dropped an investigation into @entity5 referee @entity4 after he was accused of using inappropriate language towards a footballer from @entity8			1
the official was the subject of a complaint to the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) from @entity8 after their 3 - 2 defeat by @entity14 in october but vehemently denies their claims			1
the club claimed @entity4 used " inappropriate language , " thought to be of a racist nature , during an exchange with their @entity20 midfielder @entity19			1
subsequently , the @entity22 made a complaint to the metropolitan police , who now say the probe has been shelved due to a lack of evidence			1
a statement read : " an investigation was launched into alleged comments made during a football match between @entity8 and @entity14 at @entity33 on 28 october 2012			1
" this follows on from a complaint received by the @entity36 on 29 october			1
enquires were made and no victims have come forward			2
the matter will remain as a recorded incident			2
" without a victim and / or any evidence that any offence has been committed , the matter can not currently be investigated			0
" if the situation changes and a victim and / or evidence to support an allegation of a crime comes to police attention then further enquiries will if appropriate be made			2
" @entity4 has not officiated a match since @entity8 filed their report with the @entity12 , and the 37 - year - old looks set to be kept out of the firing line until their investigation is completed			1
that could be as early as wednesday , as the @entity60 game 's governing body strives to prevent the issue dragging on as other racism cases that have dogged soccer of late			0
@entity8 captain @entity64 has only recently completed a four match ban for using racist language during a @entity5 game with @entity68 in october 2011			1
the @entity12 could only reach their own verdict after @entity64 's case had been heard in a criminal court and in july the former @entity73 captain was found not guilty of racially abusing @entity74 , brother of @entity14 defender @entity75			0
@entity8 chairman @entity77 rejected criticism of the club on tuesday after they were labeled hypocritical for their handling of the @entity84 and @entity64 situations			2
he told the @entity87 newspaper : " suppose we had tried to sweep this under the rug and said to the various players , ' look , it 's not a big deal and the press are going to be all over us , maybe you want to reconsider			0
' " if that had leaked out , we would 've really been crucified			0
the press seem to juxtapose ' our support ' of @entity64 and what 's going on here and looking at us as being a bit hypocritical			0
we have to divorce the @entity64 situation from this			0
" last season @entity103 striker @entity102 was banned for eight matches after being found guilty of racially abusing @entity14 's @entity106 defender @entity105			0
recently , a number of black players refused to wear t - shirts promoting an anti-racism campaign in protest at a perceived lack of action about the problem .			0
