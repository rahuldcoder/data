-- the effects of the @entity3 federal government shutdown are threatening to ripple out into the solar system			0
@entity6 's next mission to @entity7 , due to launch next month , is in danger of being delayed			2
" we are just inside of seven weeks to launch and we are shut down , " @entity9 , the head of the mission , said late wednesday			2
the project , known as @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , aims to put a spacecraft in orbit around the @entity7 to study how it lost much of its atmosphere and became a desolate world			1
scientists find evidence of supervolcanoes on @entity7 @entity14 is currently scheduled to take off from @entity24 in @entity25 on november 18 and has a 20 - day launch window			1
if it misses that opportunity , the team will have to wait more than two years for their next chance to launch , according to @entity9 , a planetary scientist at the @entity31			0
large parts of the @entity3 government began shutting down early tuesday , and there is so far little sign of a solution to the political crisis that caused the stoppages			0
the shutdown has already had an effect on preparations for the @entity7 mission , with a launch dress rehearsal and mission readiness review canceled this week , @entity9 said			1
the mission has some margin for delays in its schedule , he said , but " every day is gold			0
we hate to give up margin days			0
" @entity53 discovered in @entity7 soil when the shutdown started to become a real prospect , @entity14 scientists began talking to @entity6 's @entity58 in @entity59 in the hope that their project would be exempt , @entity9 said			1
opinion : shutdown a huge waste and cost to science if the paralysis drags on , the setback to the project could be more than just a 26 month wait for the next launch window			1
" the @entity14 mission is studying the sun 's impact on the @entity7 upper atmosphere , " @entity9 said			1
" launching in this window places them at a solar maximum , for the greatest impacts of the sun 's effect on @entity7 ' upper atmosphere			2
the next window , if they are forced to launch , would put the spacecraft 's arrival at solar minimum			0
" @entity6 grounded by shutdown			0

seven weeks before the planned launch , " we are shutdown , " says project *leader*
if the mission misses its window , it will have to wait another 26 months
the @entity14 project aims to study the @entity7 's loss of much of its atmosphere
a launch rehearsal and mission readiness review have already been canceled
