@entity0 -- the @entity3 general counsel threatened legal action thursday against a former @entity5 who wrote a revealing book about last year 's @entity9 raid , warning him he has violated secrecy agreements and broken federal law			1
in a letter addressed to " @entity14 , " the pen name of book author @entity16 , general counsel @entity12 wrote the @entity3 is considering pursuing " all remedies legally available " against the former seal and his publisher , @entity21			1
" in the judgment of the @entity3 , you are in material breach and violation of the nondisclosure agreements you signed			1
further public dissemination of your book will aggravate your breach and violation of your agreements , " @entity12 wrote			2
the book is called " no @entity40 " and is a gripping account of the @entity5 raid on @entity9 's compound in @entity36 last year that ended in the death of the world 's most notorious terrorist leader			1
the story sheds more light on the now famous skill and daring of the @entity5			1
but the book 's very existence stoked controversy because members of the elite unit do n't usually divulge details of their operations			2
the book is one of several accounts about the operation to have surfaced after last year 's raid			0
buzz ramps up over @entity5 's @entity9 book government officials only recently became aware the former @entity5 was writing a book , but they were told it encompassed more than just the raid and included vignettes from training and other missions			1
they wanted to see a copy , a @entity3 official said , to make sure no classified information would be released and to see if the book contained any information that might identify other team members			1
thursday 's letter to @entity72 came after a department review of the book			1
@entity72 wrote in the book that he was part of a team heading up a stairwell in search of @entity9 , forces led by a seal point man			1
" we were less than five steps from getting to the top when i heard suppressed shots			0
" the point man had seen a man peeking out of the door on the right side of the hallway about ten feet in front of him			0
i could n't tell from my position if the rounds hit the target or not			0
" they went into a room and saw two women standing over a man at the foot of a bed , " hysterically crying and wailing in @entity103			0
" one of the women shouted in @entity103 and moved toward the point man			0
" swinging his gun to the side , " the point man grabbed the women and moved them to a corner			0
" if either woman had on a suicide vest , he probably saved our lives , but it would have cost him his own			0
it was a selfless decision made in a split second , " @entity72 wrote			2
@entity72 described how he and another seal entered the room and saw the man , clad in a white sleeveless t - shirt , loose tan pants and a tan tunic , twitching and convulsing			2
the author said he and another seal finished him off with several rounds and soon after identified him as the notorious leader of @entity125			2
the killing occurred even though a government lawyer told the @entity5 that if @entity9 did n't pose a threat , he should be detained			1
the author found two empty firearms during a search of the area , saying @entity9 apparently " had n't even prepared a defense " and had " no intention of fighting			1
" according to an earlier and contradictory account from a @entity138 official , @entity9 was shot after the @entity5 went into the room			1
that account said the @entity125 leader was moving , possibly toward one of the weapons that were in the room when he was shot			0
he never had a gun in hand but posed an imminent threat , according to the @entity138 official			0
@entity72 said he had mixed feelings about president @entity149 , who ordered the operation			2
" none of us were huge fans of @entity149			0
we respected him as the commander - in - chief of the military and for giving us the green light on the mission , " wrote the former seal , who was a 36 - year - old chief petty officer when he left the @entity5 as a highly decorated commando in april			1
@entity1 obtained a copy of the book , which will officially be released september 4			0
it first had a release date of september 11 , but @entity163 , a @entity21 imprint , said the book will come out early because of " overwhelming excitement in the marketplace			0
" the first printing of the book , already an @entity171 best seller , is now 575,000 copies , according to @entity163			0
opinion : sense and nonsense about @entity149 and @entity9 @entity1 's @entity176 contributed to this report .			2
