-- i have the great privilege of writing the theater column for @entity4 , the arts - and - culture journal founded by @entity8 art critic @entity7 and pianist @entity9 in 1982			1
some people have to be in an office at 8 a.m. , but i get to be at the theater at 8 p.m. it is a pretty sweet gig			1
the power of theater comes from its ability to surprise			1
once or twice a season , i am treated to an unexpected discovery : while movies so often are cut , polished , @entity19 'd and market - researched to death , even the most commercial piece of tourist - bait theater -- lookin ' at you , " @entity28 " -- contains within it an element of unpredictability			1
the audiences , unfortunately , are drearily predictable			1
it 's the old one - in - every - family phenomenon : they will be late			1
their cell phones will ring , and some of them , by @entity37 , will answer them			0
they will text , and they may even play a few rounds of @entity42 during the third act			1
they are depressing not because their bad manners surprise us but because they do not surprise us			0
i found myself in the news this week after offering a surprise of my own at a @entity54 theater : the woman seated next to me was on her phone throughout most of the show			1
( it was " @entity63 , " in case you 're wondering , a musical based on " @entity62			0
" you know what show you should n't see in @entity54 if you have the attention span of a goldfish ? one based on " @entity62			1
" ) when she was not on her phone , she and her friends were engaged in a four - part imitation of a " @entity71 " brunch conversation			1
i asked her nicely -- more than once -- but she did not respond to courtesy			0
she said : " just do n't look			2
" so i took her phone from her and tossed it			2
there was a moment of wonderful , shocked silence			0
she salvaged such self - respect as she could -- which is to say , she slapped me -- and then stalked off in search of her phone			1
a few minutes later , i was visited by an annoyed gentleman in a black suit and soon enough found myself out on the street			0
yes , it was worth it			0
in part , i blame the theater managers			1
if you seat people who show up late , they will show up late			1
one or two high - profile ejections a month would go a long way toward beating some sense into the theater - going public			2
but you can never design a perfect protocol			0
people are awful , of course -- somebody once observed that every civilization faces a barbarian invasion every generation in the form of its children -- and the @entity102 and off - @entity102 crowd is full of miscreants			2
theater is @entity54 and @entity54 is theater , and @entity54 is not much like the rest of the country			2
( @entity109 , a summertime favorite in @entity111 , has a menu for dogs			0
) @entity54 is one of the world capitals of self - importance			0
and , with the possible exception of @entity119 , there is no city in the country where self - importance is more disconnected from actual importance			0
if i could buy @entity54 for what they 're worth and sell them for what they think they 're worth , i 'd own @entity131 from @entity132 to @entity133			0
that guy whispering into his cell phone ? he is n't getting the news that little @entity137 finally has a donor for his heart transplant ; he 's just another schmuck having a schmuck conversation with schmucks elsewhere			1
that guy tapping away on his smartphone is n't restructuring the derivatives markets ; he 's playing " @entity146			1
" the lady to my right , i am willing to bet , was not receiving her orders from the @entity150 , and her phone did not self - destruct			2
and i am not sorry			0
i am advised that what i did was almost certainly a crime			0
and if the law , in its majesty , should decide that i need to spend a night in jail over this episode , then i will be happy to do so			0
but i think of it as an act of criticism			1
occasionally , a shocking gesture is called for , perhaps even a histrionic one			0
i may have met conventional - grade rudeness with thermonuclear counterforce , but i did it in the interests of civility , violating standards to preserve them			0
theater - goers on @entity171 jokingly compared me to @entity172 : not the hero @entity173 deserves , the hero it needs			2
i do n't know about that : @entity177 is not much of a superpower			2
but we will live in exactly as rude and coarse a world as we will tolerate , and i do not intend to tolerate very much			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

theater critic @entity183 is sick of rude audiences who talk or text during plays
a woman sitting next to him would n't stop using her phone , so he took it and threw it
she slapped him ; he was *kicked* out . but he 's glad he did it , calls it an act of criticism
in part he blames managers who let people in late and do n't stop *distracting* behavior
