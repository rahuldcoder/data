-- in a sea of uncertainty , two bits of good news emerged wednesday			1
the @entity6 ship @entity5 picked up fresh signals that officials hope are locator beacons from the data recorders of the missing @entity11			2
the ship had first picked up the underwater pulses saturday			1
but then , for the next three days , nothing			2
on tuesday , the ship once again reacquired the signals			0
that 's four signals in the same broad area : two on saturday ; two on tuesday			1
" i believe we are searching in the right area but we need to visually identify wreckage before we can confirm with certainty that this is the final resting place of @entity11 , " @entity20 said			1
the second piece of good news ? authorities analyzed the signals picked up saturday and determined they were not of natural origin and was likely sourced from specific electronic equipment			0
" they believe the signals to be consistent with the specification and description of a flight data recorder , " @entity20 said			0
signals getting weaker wednesday is day 33 in the search for @entity11 , which went missing march 8			1
it was carrying 239 people			0
authorities have n't given up trying			0
instead , they are pinning their hopes on the so - pings			0
but time is not on their side			0
the batteries powering the flight recorders ' locator beacons are certified to be working for 30 days			0
stored in a plane 's tail , they are designed to begin sending off distinct , high - pitched signals as soon as they come in contact with water			1
" the signals are getting weaker			0
which means we 're either moving away from the search area or the pinger batteries are dying , " @entity20 said			1
the first signal , at 4:45 p.m. @entity64 on saturday , lasted 2 hours 20 minutes			0
the second , at 9:27 p.m. saturday , lasted 13 minutes			0
the third signal was picked up tuesday at 4:27 p.m. that lasted 5 minutes 32 seconds			0
the fourth , at 10:17 p.m. tuesday , was 7 minutes long			0
" it 's certainly encouraging that more signals have been detected , " @entity70 spokesman adm. @entity69 told @entity0			1
" there is still much work to do , however			0
" four reasons to believe ; six reasons to doubt discovery of possible ' locator beacon ' pulses gives hope wednesday 's search includes up to 11 military planes , four civilian aircraft as well as 14 ships -- three of which , @entity6 's @entity5 further north and the @entity86 @entity85 and @entity87 01 to the south -- will be focusing underwater			1
all told , everyone involved will be scouring a 29,000 - square - mile zone centered about 1,400 miles northwest of @entity91 , according to @entity6 's @entity92			1
that 's large and challenging , but still pales in comparison to the once nearly 3 million miles , at sea and on land , the searchers were scouring for signs of the lost aircraft a few weeks ago			1
@entity100 , a @entity101 air force commodore involved in the effort , noted that authorities once " did n't even know which haystack " to look in for the aircraft			0
" i think we have got a much clearer picture around the areas that we need to concentrate on , " @entity100 told @entity0 's @entity105 from @entity106			1
authorities greatly shrank that area after analyzing satellite data to determine @entity11 had set off from @entity112 toward @entity113 , turned around to go back over the @entity114 , then ended up in the southern @entity115			1
why ? no one really knows			0
the best chance to answer that question may rest wherever the plane -- and its so - called black boxes , with their trove of information about the plane and its movements -- now resides			1
search planes dispatched day after day looking for evidence of the missing airliner -- a floating wing , a seat cushion , anything -- thus far have come up empty			1
the latest , greatest hopes have come from crews listening underwater for signs of flight 370			2
the first such possible breakthrough came last friday and saturday , when a @entity138 ship detected pulses that may have been from the plane			2
no more have been heard since			0
according to @entity100 , " the main focus " centers around the site of saturday 's discovery from @entity6 's @entity5			1
it used more advanced detection gear than that aboard the @entity138 vessel and was found some 375 miles away , leading @entity20 to believe they are separate signals			0
the first signal , detected by a towed pinger locator , persisted for more than two hours ; a second went on for about 13 minutes			0
tuesday afternoon , it lasted about 5 minutes and 32 seconds			0
tuesday night , about seven minutes			0
beyond the dwindling battery life , there 's all the ocean to contend with : the @entity5 signals were in water about 2.6 miles deep , meaning a number of things could literally get in the way of or otherwise disrupt the pulses			2
searchers ' intent not to roil the waters any further is why air and seaborne traffic in that find area is being limited , and why there is no rush to put in underwater drones to take photos			1
" the better the @entity5 can define the area the easier it will be for the @entity173 to subsequently search for aircraft wreckage , " @entity20 said			1
@entity176 in mind with the @entity179 disaster , it took the underwater vehicle 20 days to get to the wreckage			2
" what happens after the @entity185 plane 's pingers die ? and it 's not as if , if more pulses are detected , they 'll lead down in a straight line to the flight recorders			1
as is , the pings that were heard could have emanated from anywhere within a 5 - mile radius , said @entity194 , a former inspector general for the @entity196 @entity195			1
finding more signals could narrow the search area			1
without them , authorities could then start the painstaking process of using side - scanning sonar to try to find the aircraft on the ocean 's bottom			2
meanwhile , the air search continues			2
as @entity100 explained , this area is " slightly different " than that being probed for pings because it is focused on surface debris , which would have shifted over the past few weeks -- thanks in part to a cyclone packing winds in excess of 160 mph that pushed through two weeks ago			1
so far , none of the aircraft that have been sent out has found anything			0
and even if it is narrowed , wednesday 's air search area is still roughly the size of @entity220			1
@entity222 of @entity101 stated : " it 's a large task that 's still ahead of us			2
" next steps in underwater search pings without wreckage ' befuddling ' the absence of wreckage near these detected signals leaves some skeptical , worried that the @entity138 and @entity6 ship 's finds could be yet another false lead in an investigation that 's been full of them			1
acknowledging " a very high - speed vertical impact " could explain the lack of aircraft remnants , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity237 said there 's reason to be cautious			2
" it 's either the most extraordinary event , or those pings were n't real , " @entity237 said			2
" it 's somewhat befuddling			2
" @entity246 , the partner of @entity196 passenger @entity247 , is n't convinced about anything			1
she told @entity0 's @entity105 she thinks the plane was hijacked			1
whether that proves true , one thing she wo n't believe are the @entity185 officials heading the investigation			0
" all of us pretty well agree that until there 's the bulk of the plane , the bulk of the bodies discovered , and a black box intact , we wo n't believe that it 's final evidence , " @entity246 said early wednesday from @entity113			1
" ... i do n't think the authorities have given us much confidence of their investigative skills so far			0
" the lack of clarity makes it hard to " grieve properly and ... move on , " -- something that she 's not yet willing to do			2
" i want to fight to find him , in whatever form that ends up being , " said @entity246 , who is coordinating with other passengers ' kin to press for answers			0
" and i think most of the families feel the same way			0
" until they get answers , women and men like @entity281 -- whose mother was on the @entity284 plane -- are clinging to hope while trying to hold themselves together			2
" we 're just going through so many kinds of emotion , " said @entity281			0
" ... desperate , sad and helpless -- something like that			0
" timeline : leads in the hunt for @entity11 weave drama lucrative @entity138 - @entity185 relations not derailed by search for @entity11 wife of passenger : ' i needed to know they were looking for @entity302 ' @entity0 's @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 and @entity311 and journalist @entity312 also contributed to this report .			1

@entity196 official : " we need to maintain *respectful* *optimism* and be *responsible* "
expert says refined search area manageable for underwater vessels
possible discovery of plane 's pingers *energizes* search , but for how much longer ?
agency : up to 15 planes , 14 ships could take part in wednesday 's search
