-- the @entity2 @entity1 cited drought and heat on wednesday in designating 597 counties in 14 states as primary natural disaster areas			1
" as drought persists , @entity1 will continue to partner with producers to see them through longer - term recovery , while taking the swift actions needed to help farmers and ranchers prepare their land and operations for the upcoming planting season , " agriculture secretary @entity8 said in a statement			1
the designations make qualified farmers in the areas eligible for low - interest loans , the agency said			1
affected counties have suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks , which qualified them for the automatic designation			1
@entity29 , a 62 - year - old farmer in @entity31 's @entity30 , said he has been hit hard by the drought but was not sure whether he would take advantage of the drought designation for his county by getting a low - interest loan			1
" the hay situation is not good ; the pastures burned up early because of the heat and lack of rain , " said @entity29 , who was born on a farm and has been farming since he was a teenager			0
" this is the worst drought that i have ever seen			1
an emergency loan is great , but it 's still borrowed money , and as a farmer , that 's not good because you have to pay it back			2
" @entity49 of @entity50 , @entity51 , said the drought has affected his bull - selling business because he uses grass for feed and has to buy hay			1
" the fact that it has n't rained significantly since june is going to make 2013 look rather bleak because the ponds are low , the creeks are low , and without adequate moisture in the next few months when grazing comes up , our production is going to be significantly less than normal , " he said			2
last year , the @entity1 designated 2,245 counties in 39 states , or 71 percent of the @entity2 , as disaster areas due to drought			1
@entity68 battle wildfires wednesday 's announcement comes a day after the @entity71 said that 2012 had been the hottest year on record for the continental @entity2 and the second - worst for " extreme " weather such as hurricanes , droughts or floods			1
the year 's average temperature of 55.3 degrees fahrenheit across the " @entity78 " was more than 3.2 degrees warmer than the average for the 20th century , @entity71 reported			2
that topped the previous record , set in 1998 , by a full degree			0
drought shriveled crops across the farm belt , leading to an expected rise in food prices in 2013 , according to @entity1			0
it also turned forests of the @entity89 into tinder stands that exploded into wildfires over the summer , scorching millions of acres and destroying hundreds of homes			0
seven of the 10 hottest years on @entity2 record , which date to 1895 , and four of the hottest five have occurred since 1990 , according to @entity71			0
rough winter weather hits @entity96 the year also saw @entity98 sea ice hit a record low in more than 30 years of satellite observations and studies that found the world 's major ice sheets have been shrinking at an increasing rate			2
scientists are quick to point out that no single storm can be blamed on climate change , but say a warming world raises the odds of extreme weather			0
" i think , unfortunately , 2012 really may well be the new normal , " said @entity111 , director of the climate and clean air program at the @entity114 , a @entity2 environmental group			0
" it 's the kind of year we expect , given the global warming trend is ongoing			0
" the science of global warming is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most researchers , who point to heat - trapping carbon emissions from the burning of fossil fuels as the major cause			0
