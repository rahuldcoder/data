@entity0 wonders if her cousin @entity1 would still be alive today if she had been more aware of how her weight contributed to her diabetes			1
" she refused to take care of herself by not watching what she ate or exercising , " @entity0 wrote in a blog post honoring the woman she describes as the " life of the party " -- funny , beautiful and genuine			1
@entity10 died of a heart attack at age 44			0
although @entity10 lived with diabetes for years and worked in the medical field , her perception of her own disease was skewed , @entity0 said			0
@entity10 told her cousin that the doctor wanted to take an aggressive approach to her weight loss , but @entity10 did n't believe she was obese			1
" this is the problem within the @entity24 community , " @entity0 wrote on the blog			1
" we love our curves , but the line between beautiful and deadly curves is blurred			0
" in a 2010 study , @entity29 and her colleagues surveyed 1,076 @entity24 women who went to public health clinics in @entity34 about their weight			1
the researchers found about 25 % of the overweight @entity24 women perceived their weight as " normal , " while only 15 % of @entity39 white women did			1
" @entity24 and @entity43 - @entity42 women were more likely to consider their weight normal when in fact they were overweight , " said @entity29 , a professor at the @entity40			1
latinos overall are also less likely to lose weight and " more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease risk factors and other obesity related diseases , " the study authors wrote			1
for example , diabetes affects close to 25.8 million people in the @entity42 , according to the @entity54 -- about 8.3 % of the general population			1
but the debilitating disease disproportionately affects @entity57 , almost double those of @entity39 whites , according to the @entity60			1
unfortunately , diabetes is n't the only disease causing concern in the @entity57 community			0
@entity57 are also disproportionately affected by obesity and stroke , according to dr. @entity66 , who serves as a health and wellness consultant in @entity70			1
although stroke rates in the general population have declined dramatically over the last decade , @entity46 are still more likely to experience a stroke compared to other ethnic groups			2
particularly among @entity76 -- the largest subgroup of @entity57 in the @entity42 -- stroke is the leading cause of disability and third leading cause of death			0
overall , @entity82 - @entity42 suffer 34 % more from this disease than non-hispanic whites , according to a 2013 study published in the @entity87 journal			2
experts say these health disparities can be attributed to many causes , but chief among them is a lack of access to quality health care			1
the @entity42 @entity95 estimates 1 out of every 3 @entity57 does n't have health insurance			2
about half of whites are covered through an employer - sponsored health plan , compared to 28 % of @entity57 , according to a @entity100			1
" right now , many @entity46 are unable to manage the costs for preventative care , " @entity66 said , " and will often develop secondary conditions that can be even more serious because they could not manage their chronic conditions with proper treatment			2
" once the @entity108 goes into effect on january 1 , it should ease the stress for many hispanics who have lower - paying jobs that do n't offer health insurance			2
cultural factors also play a role in putting the @entity24 community at risk for cardiovascular diseases			1
latinos are raised to be self - reliant , which may be the reason 42 % of them say they 've had " zero visits " to a medical provider			2
it was the ethnic group least likely to use prescription medicine in 2010 , according to the @entity126			0
" but with some lifestyle adjustments , like switching to a healthier diet and getting regular exercise , @entity46 can drastically change their health issues , " @entity66 said			2
at their core , authentic @entity57 dishes include fresh fruits , herbs and beans , all of which are healthy			0
but with immigration and acculturation to the @entity42 often comes a change in eating behaviors , such as cooking fewer meals at home , eating larger portions , preparing foods differently , and buying more cheap and convenient fast foods loaded with sodium , fat and sugar			0
because food and family play such an important role in the @entity57 community , organizations like the @entity151 for @entity152 are focusing their efforts on implementing more healthy shopping programs like the " @entity159 " ( @entity160 and @entity161 ) to help @entity57 make healthier and more economical choices when grocery shopping			0
" @entity166 is very strong in the @entity57 culture , " said @entity164 , program manager for the @entity165 at the @entity152			0
" the act of sitting down at the dinner table is more important than the actual food			0
" many @entity57 parents feel guilty about putting their own health needs above those of their families , according to the @entity60			2
they feel their time and money could be better spent than using it for preventive care			0
in an effort to break down this mindset , the diabetes association has a @entity183 health campaign called @entity184 â€” or " for your family " -- encouraging @entity46 to stay healthy if they want to be there for their families			0
while these efforts to help educate @entity46 about lifestyle changes will help , dr. @entity188 , director of the @entity189 at @entity190 , said the health care system also needs to change so physicians do n't struggle to get their patients the treatments they deserve			1
" for each patient i see , i have to spend at least 20 minutes on the phone with insurance companies begging them to approve the proper diabetes medication for my patients , and i do n't get reimbursed for that time , " said @entity188			0
" unfortunately , @entity108 will not improve this condition			0
" while the @entity108 may leave something to be desired from physicians , @entity0 hopes that with widespread access to health care , latinos around the country will better educate themselves about their health and heed the warnings of their doctors			1
because knowing that @entity1 ' death could have been prevented hurts more than anything else .			0
