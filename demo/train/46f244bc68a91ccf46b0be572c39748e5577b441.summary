-- " my @entity2 number is 6856			1
i was at @entity4 from january 1975 to april 1975			1
" with those words , @entity5 reached out to @entity0 last week after seeing its stories about @entity4 , where the @entity9 conducted top - secret drug and chemical tests on soldier volunteers			1
@entity13 was just 22 years old when he was recruited for testing at @entity4 , one of about 7,000 soldiers who took part in the program from 1955 to 1975			1
the army field computer operator says that in december 1974 , @entity4 recruiters came to @entity21 , @entity22 , where he was stationed and told him he could help design the new field artillery computer system			1
in january 1975 , he reported to @entity4			1
his first test was non-chemical , simply determining what size keyboard to use , he remembers			1
a display would flash a series of numbers , and he would try to input them using the test keypad and his bare hands			1
next , he repeated the task wearing gloves			1
" then it was with a gas mask on , " @entity13 said			1
" then with a gas mask on in a gas chamber			1
then it was ' try to input the numbers after being exposed to some gas			1
' my accuracy rate went from 99 % barehanded to 57 % gassed			1
one in particular haunts him to this day : he recalls being in a " padded cell " with just a thin exercise mat and a blanket			1
the room was orange ; the walls " flowed down onto the floor like lava			1
" " i remember putting my finger in the lava and watching it flow around my finger , " he says			1
" there was a nurse who would come in and take blood samples , urine -- i had to wait till they came in to void -- and give me water			1
i do not know how many days i was in there			1
i lost seven pounds during this ' lost period			1
' " @entity13 said that after that test , he was told to report to the medical center and was shown a piece of paper that he had signed , volunteering for other experiments			1
he did n't remember signing but says it was his signature			2
" i was told that if i did not do the experiment as i had agreed , i would be listed as @entity80 and returned to @entity21			2
" @entity80 is a military term that means the service member is " unsatisfactory			2
" in other words , the service member failed to complete his or her assignment			2
" it is not a label one wants to have applied to them , " @entity13 said			2
" we were isolated and given injections			2
i secretly wrote down what the vials said , but my notes were taken from me by a doctor			2
i was threatened with punishment			2
" in an effort to find out what drugs he had been given and what his health files contained , @entity13 filed a @entity105 request			1
he got his records in 1985			2
they showed that he had been given a potentially deadly nerve agent called sarin gas -- and its antidotes			2
according to the records , he had also been exposed to physostigmine , scopalmine and 2 - @entity113 , and these were used " to treat anticholinesterase inhibitor overdoses			2
" he was also given a chemical called @entity117			2
he still has no idea what it was			2
@entity13 says that before the testing began , he was given a complete physical			2
his ekg -- a test that records the heart 's electrical activity -- was perfect , and he was rated in perfect shape			1
" according to the @entity105 , i was subjected to the same chemical twice within 25 days , " @entity13 said			2
" the doctor 's note ... noted that two exposures so close together caused a negative reaction to the subject 's heart			2
" for most veterans in the program , the stay was two months , but @entity13 's stay was extended to four			1
when his @entity4 tour was up , he went back to @entity21			2
" i was sent back with the threat of ' do n't tell anyone anything , and if anyone asks , say you are fine			2
' " he was honorably discharged from the @entity9 in 1977			1
he spent a year with the @entity146 and joined the @entity147 in 1988			0
in 1995 , another ekg showed abnormalities			0
his began seeing a private cardiologist			0
an mri revealed 98 % blockage in one of his arteries , and the cardiologist asked whether he had ever had an injury to his heart			0
" he said it looked like the heart had been damaged but not due to a heart attack			0
" in 2007 , @entity13 had a quadruple bypass			0
to this day , he wonders whether the damage was related to @entity4			0
all things considered , the married father of two says , he does not regret his service			0
" i believe it may have helped save the lives of other soldiers in the case of chemical attacks			1
i recall that ( the doctor ) who conducted the tests was instrumental in helping the victims of the @entity176 subway terrorist attack , " @entity13 said			1
" i guess it is like when a service member goes to war and gets wounded but does not regret their decision to go to war			0
" ' time bomb ' his only concern , he says , is for his two children			0
" there is nothing in the file about the experiments where i was kept in the padded cell			0
that is what i would like to know about for my children 's sake			0
considering @entity197 has been shown to affect veterans ' offspring and possibly second generation , it is like having a time bomb that may go off or may be a dud			0
" this was just one of the stories @entity0 got from @entity4 test veterans responding to the special investigations of the @entity9 's top - secret @entity209 drug and chemical testing program			1
@entity211 , 70 , said he volunteered at @entity4 in 1964			1
he remembers putting on a hospital gown , getting in bed and having six or seven doctors arrive bedside in gas masks			0
they put a drop of liquid on the inside of his forearm			0
" whatever happened , i have no idea			0
i woke up in the same bed " 24 hours later , @entity211 said			0
in 2000 , @entity211 received a call notifying him that he 'd been exposed to sarin gas			0
@entity211 , who says he was wounded while serving two tours in @entity229 , has a blood disease and a related skin condition that he blames on chemical exposure at @entity4			0
@entity211 also said he was more nervous and irritable after his two - month temporary duty at the @entity235 base			1
read about widow who blames @entity237 for her husband 's death @entity240 went to @entity4 in 1966 to be closer to his home in @entity242 , @entity243			0
he recalls getting an injection on a monday ; he " woke up " on wednesday			0
in the past year or two , @entity240 says , he applied for his records and learned that he 'd been given @entity246 , an incapacitating agent			0
@entity240 says he remembers little of what happened while he was under the influence of @entity246 , but he thinks they went to the rifle range , because his thumb was bruised , apparently from getting caught in the breech of an @entity255 rifle			0
@entity240 , now 65 , says his health has been good			0
dr. @entity257 , a former @entity4 researcher , took issue with veteran @entity259 , who said he was coerced into taking part in the tests after arriving at @entity4			1
" no one was forced to participate nor told they would be punished or imprisoned if they chose not to take part , " @entity257 commented on @entity0			1
" those who participated all received letters of commendation and all received thorough medical evaluations before and after being in the program			1
" @entity272 , the attorney who has filed a lawsuit seeking health care for @entity4 veterans , said @entity277 ' story is not unique			0
a number of @entity4 veterans have told him superiors threatened repercussions for soldiers who quit : " you 're going to get a bad conduct discharge , or we 're going to write you up and send you back , and we 're going to send you right to @entity229 , " @entity272 said			1
read about @entity259 ' time at @entity4 ' i was easily swayed ' @entity287 , now 62 , was still a teenager when he started his two - month tour at @entity4			0
" since i was only 19 , i was easily swayed , wanting to do my patriotic duty , " he says			1
" i have no idea what they injected into me , as i ca n't recall much of my two months there			0
" @entity287 says that since his discharge , he gets a survey every five to 10 years asking how his health is			0
" i always responded by asking them for a physical and a request to know what they tested on me , " @entity287 said			0
" those questions were never answered			0
" he knows he was injected with atropine and was tear - gassed			0
he says that while he 's not in perfect health , he does n't blame @entity4 but feels the government should take responsibility for those harmed			0
he says he 'd do it again			0
" i 'm patriot , but do n't send me out in a war unarmed , and if i come back injured , take care of me			0
i 'd volunteer in a minute if there was a need , but there needs to be government responsibility on the back end			0
