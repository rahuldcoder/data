-- the next stop in a legal battle over a controversial new abortion law in @entity4 could be the @entity6 @entity5			1
on monday abortion - rights groups filed an emergency motion asking the @entity5 to block @entity4 from enforcing part of the law , which is considered among the most restrictive in the country			1
justice @entity12 has given the state until november 12 to respond , according to court documents			1
the motion comes four days after a federal appeals court reinstated a key part of the law -- a provision that requires doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they 're providing abortion services			1
the appeals court 's decision allowed that provision to remain in place , but monday 's motion asks the @entity5 to overturn that ruling			1
since the decision , more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in @entity4 have stopped providing abortions , @entity31 , a deputy legal director of the @entity32 , told reporters in a conference call monday			2
" a dozen abortion providers were forced to cancel appointments immediately , " said @entity40 , director and ceo of @entity42			2
" our patients are scared , some are angry , some have said they do n't know how they 're going to make the long trip to the next closest provider			0
" @entity51 , 37 , a freelance consultant , told reporters she is now considering flying to @entity53 for an abortion after her appointment in @entity56 , @entity4 , was canceled			1
she said she and her fiance decided to pursue an abortion for financial reasons			0
" we can barely afford our own health care , let alone a child , she said			0
" after a lot of soul searching , we decided we want to start a family someday , but we just ca n't do it right now			0
because of last thursday 's ruling , that decision has been taken out of our hands			0
" a @entity42 lawsuit against the state over the law is still pending			2
the suit -- filed in @entity73 in @entity56 on behalf of more than a dozen women 's health care providers across @entity4 -- alleges that the abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions			1
the bill originally failed to gain approval because of a @entity84 filibuster led by state sen. @entity85			1
gov. @entity86 then called the @entity87 into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill			0
@entity86 cheered last week 's appeals court ruling			0
" today 's decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of @entity4 , " he said in a statement last week			2
" we will continue doing everything we can to protect a culture of life in our state			0
" @entity0 's @entity103 and @entity104 contributed to this report .			0
