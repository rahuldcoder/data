@entity2 scored a crucial winning goal at @entity8 on last day of the 2006 - 07 season			1
@entity4 will be paying @entity5 an undisclosed compensation fee to settle the dispute , meaning an independent tribunal chaired @entity13 will not reconvene to rule on the controversy			2
a statement from @entity17 chairman @entity16 and @entity4 chief executive @entity18 released to the @entity19 said : " both clubs are pleased to announce that a satisfactory settlement for compensation has been reached which brings the dispute between @entity5 and @entity4 to an end			2

the affair has sparked three separate inquiries , the first of which led to a $ 8 million fine for @entity4 , but crucially no points deduction			0
but @entity5 refused to give up and in september 2008 an independent arbitration ruled in their favor in a claim for compensation from @entity4			0
the @entity33 and the @entity51 promptly announced another fresh inquiry , but the out - of court settlement looks set to bring the affair to an amicable conclusion			0
@entity4 , whose @entity56 owner @entity55 has been hard hit by the global economic downturn , were reported by @entity59 to be paying the compensation fee , which could rise to $ 35 million , in installments			0
the money will certainly be welcomed by @entity5 , who are pressing for promotion from the @entity65 to the @entity33			0
