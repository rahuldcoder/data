-- streaming music service @entity1 launched apps for @entity4 and @entity5 on tuesday that are designed to make it easy for music fans to find and share digital playlists for practically any occasion			1
think of @entity1 as curated , hand - picked internet radio			1
like @entity13 , @entity1 is not a stream - on - demand service ( meaning , you ca n't request to play a certain track or album )			1
unlike @entity13 , @entity1 does n't impose any limitations on how much music you can listen to and it does n't serve any audio advertisements			1
additionally , @entity1 does n't focus on creating artist based radio stations -- although you can do that -- instead , it focuses on connecting users with curated or peer - created mix tapes			1
these playlists are organized around activities ( like " @entity31 " or " coding " ) , genres ( " ' 70s @entity34 " or " @entity35 " ) , moods and even @entity37			0
for instance , there is a whole playlist category dedicated to @entity41 , featuring playlists like " @entity43 " and " covering cash			0
" the playlists are designed to capture a certain mood , event or activity			0
using the free @entity1 mobile app for @entity51 [ @entity52 link ] and @entity4 [ @entity54 link ] , users can search and browse through @entity1 's expertly curated playlists , save their favorites to their phone and share what they are listening to with friends on @entity60 and @entity61			1
the @entity1 team 's previous venture , @entity64 , was acquired by @entity65 last fall			0
@entity1 just closed a financing round led by the same investors that were previously involved in @entity64			0
the company clearly has big plans for enhancing its social offerings by allowing users to share their playlists or favorites via social networks			0
as it stands , @entity1 sees itself as a " music concierge " and a better , smarter way of handling social music discovery			2
after using the @entity51 app over the last 24 hours , we agree			0
without a doubt , @entity1 has the smartest , most well thought out collection of playlists of any of the subscription music services			2
what we really appreciate is that it is clear that a lot of vetting has gone into creating the officially sanctioned lists			0
if your friends are on @entity1 , you can also use the app to follow the playlists they share or like and vice versa			2
the one downside to @entity1 and its mobile app is that right now , users can only create playlists at the @entity1 website			1
moreover , @entity1 's licensing restrictions prevent users from listening to the playlists they create themselves			0
your friends can listen to your custom mix of ultimate fall in @entity108 tunes , but you , the creator ca n't			0
@entity1 's co-founder and ceo @entity112 told us that the company is looking at either partnering with existing on - demand subscription services such as @entity116 or working out its own on - demand licensing agreement so that users can listen to their own selections			1
if @entity1 can nail that last loop and provide users who are willing to pay with on - demand access to their own playlists , we could easily see @entity1 taking off in a huge way			2
still , even with the self - playlist limitations , @entity1 for @entity51 and @entity4 is one of the most promising mobile music apps we 've seen all year			1
