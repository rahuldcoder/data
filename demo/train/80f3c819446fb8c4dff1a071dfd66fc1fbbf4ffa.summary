@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands of @entity1 continued protests wednesday that began in october , targeting as environmentally hazardous the continued construction of a $ 4.8 billion gold mining project called @entity6			1
eighteen people were hurt , several by gunshots , the department 's director of health said			0
the protests continued despite tuesday night 's announcement by the @entity15 - based firm @entity14 that work on the project in the northeastern department of @entity18 would be suspended			1
@entity14 , which is based in @entity19 , @entity20 , and describes itself as one of the world 's largest oil companies , said it had suspended construction on the project " for the safety of employees and community members			1
" it noted that operations there and at the nearby @entity36 mine " have experienced intermittent work stoppages as a result of ongoing protests in the region			0
" the protests began when anti-mining activists expressed concern about the possible impact of the project on the local water supply , the company said in a statement on its website			1
" @entity46 was approved in 2010 after extensive review by the @entity1 government which included significant engagement and consultation with local communities , " it said			1
@entity52 , regional president of @entity18 , said that the central government announced the suspension of the project that critics say would adversely affect the area 's ecosystem and would leave cattle in the zone without access to water			2
but @entity62 , president of the @entity63 and a member of the @entity65 to which president @entity66 belongs , said such an outcome is improbable			0
as a candidate and now as president , @entity66 has pledged to respect contracts signed by previous governments			0

one of them is @entity80 , an anthropologist who said that @entity66 told reporters on the first day of the protests that the mining project would go forward anyway			2
" the terms of the handling have not been the most adequate on the part of the current government , because the affirmation that the conga project is going forward does not allow the minimum conditions needed for dialogue , " @entity80 said .			0
