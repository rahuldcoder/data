@entity0 -- a government - appointed commission will start reviewing thursday ways to permanently store the @entity6 ' nuclear waste			1
the @entity8 's @entity7 has been given the task of finding an alternative to the @entity12 site in @entity13 , which president @entity14 has vowed to close			1
the government has spent nearly $ 10 billion studying the @entity12 location , and the @entity14 administration estimates that ending the program will save $ 197 million in 2011			1
the @entity14 administration announced in january that the blue - ribbon panel would take a new look at the problem			2
the panel is headed by former @entity24 rep. @entity23 and former @entity25 national security adviser @entity25			2
read the commission 's charter it is highly likely that the 15 - member commission will abandon the option to store nuclear waste at @entity12			1
it is expected to take 18 months for the commission to conclude its findings , and that is n't sitting well with several lawmakers from states with temporary nuclear waste storage sites			1
@entity41 members tuesday introduced a bipartisan resolution to block the closure of @entity12 , according to media reports			1
rep. @entity45 , @entity46 , said the resolution calls on the @entity8 to follow the will of @entity48			0
" keeping waste scattered across the country , or in the case of @entity0 at @entity53 , is no longer an option , " @entity45 said in a statement			2
" we have a solution to this problem and we must move forward			0
" the @entity53 facility is one of more than 100 nuclear sites across the country where about 70,000 tons of radioactive waste are stored			1
an estimated 2,000 tons are added every year			2
how federal funds are being used to clean up @entity53 after uranium has been used in a reactor , the spent fuel remains radioactive for thousands of years			0
it is taken out and put into a pool of water , or above ground in canisters made of concrete , steel and lead			0
the @entity75 says the canisters are certified for up to 90 years of use , but that term may be extended			0
both supporters and opponents of nuclear power largely agree that storing the material in casks at nuclear plants is no long - term solution			0
if the blue - ribbon commission decides to abandon @entity12 as a nuclear storage facility , there are concerns in southern @entity13 over what will be done with the site			1
" for years , there 's never been a fallback , there 's never been a plan b , " says @entity92 , who 's been involved with the @entity12 project for decades			1
@entity92 , a consultant with @entity13 's @entity98 , says it was " only recently " that people began to discuss other possible uses for the site			0
the search for future uses of @entity12 only came into question , according to @entity92 and others , when the @entity8 filed a petition to withdraw its @entity75 license application for @entity12 earlier this month , effectively killing the project			1
the @entity8 filed its petition to withdraw the license application with prejudice , which would prevent it from being refilled			0
senate majority leader @entity114 of @entity13 has fought hard to end the @entity12 project , which is unpopular with many @entity116			2
he has asked the @entity117 to consider alternative uses for the site			0
those alternatives include national security activities and renewable energy research			0
but the closure of the project could have a major economic impact in the region			0
@entity127 , the chairman of the @entity128 , says closing @entity12 slams the door on 4,000 construction jobs and about 1,500 permanent jobs that would have been created if the site ever got up and running			1
@entity1 's @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
