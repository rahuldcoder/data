-- of the 12 people killed in the july 2012 mass shooting at a @entity5 movie theater , 6 - year - old @entity1 was the youngest			1
long after the moments of silence have ended , people around the country will still be at a loss for words to describe what happened to the fathers , mothers , sisters , brothers , daughters and sons killed and wounded			2
those close to the victims have an especially difficult task : finding words of solace for the incomprehensible			0
grief experts say the loss of a child brings on a special kind of anguish			1
" you think about all the things you 'll miss : the graduations , the swim lessons , the dance recitals , " says @entity28 , the executive director of @entity29 , a foundation that supports those who are dealing with the grief that follows the death of a child			1
@entity28 lost her two children in a car crash in 1991 and has since channeled her grief into helping others			2
8 - year - old @entity45 victim greeted dad at finish line " one of the most important things is to listen to what the parents have to say			2
i call it ' the head and the heart			0
' their head knows their child has died , but their heart does n't want to believe it , " says @entity28			1
@entity0 's photo gallery of the @entity65 shooting victims prompted many commenters to share opinions on what to say and what not to say when talking to bereaved parents : @entity0 commenter " @entity71 " said : " when you want to comfort a parent whose child has died , please do n't say ' i ca n't imagine ... ' i do n't know why , but when people say this , and i hear people on air saying it all the time , it upsets me			1
my son died 2 years ago , and the way i interpret those words might seem skewed , but i ca n't help it			2
i hear those words as saying : ' that could never happen to me ' or ' you are so different from me i ca n't relate ' ... " @entity0 commenter " sallyforth88 " responded : " when people , who are trying to comfort someone , say things like , ' i ca n't imagine , ' they really , probably ca n't imagine because it 's never happened to them			1
would you rather have someone say to you , ' i know what you must be feeling ? ' i find saying something like that is 10 times worse			0
but they are just trying to comfort you			0
please do n't be so sensitive when people are only trying to help ... some people do n't know what in the heck to say			2
" surviving with the guilt of living sometimes it 's not what you say , it 's what you do n't say , according to psychiatrist @entity114			1
" the best thing to do is be around and listen to the parents , and try not to inject your own opinion , " says @entity114			2
" inevitably most people have never lost a child , so saying ' i know how you feel ' is not going to help			1
" even if you have lost a child , @entity114 says the phrase " i know how you feel " is too subjective : every parent 's response is different			1
some people try to make the best of it ; some people fall apart ; some people get angry ; some people try and channel it into something positive			0
" they think they must say something			0
we 're a society where we 're uncomfortable with silence			0
we think we need to put a reason why this happened out there , " says @entity28			0
sometimes just being present is the best thing you can do			0
let the parents know you 're there for them : pass them a tissue , rub their back , allow their tears fall onto your shoulder			0
" you do n't have to say a lot or try to take the pain away			0
words like ' i am so sorry ' or ' i am here for you ' can be healing			0
it 's important to acknowledge their pain and not change the subject or tell them it 's not so bad , " says clinical psychologist @entity152 , who specializes in grief and trauma			2
and while it 's easy to try to find that proverbial silver lining or light at the end of the tunnel , @entity114 says comments such as " this will pass " should be avoided , because while the grief may pass , the memories of the child wo n't -- and should n't			1
" the whole idea of finishing grief does n't mean you stop mourning a child or you get over it , but the thing is you have to have closure on the emotional life			1
you want to be able to move on			0
" after loss , one father 's walk to pound grief into the ground please share the words and actions that have helped you through traumatic events in the comments section below .			1
