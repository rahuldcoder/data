-- on the basis of the evidence currently in the public record , one likely outcome of the case against @entity3 is a mixed one : there may be sufficient evidence for a reasonable prosecutor to indict him for manslaughter , but there may also be doubt sufficient for a reasonable jury to acquit him			1
any such predictions should be accepted with an abundance of caution , however , because the evidence known to the special prosecutor , but not to the public , may paint a different picture			1
it may be stronger or weaker			0
media reports suggest that police found @entity3 with grass stains on the back of his shirt , bloody bruises on the back of his head and other indicia that may support his contention that @entity32 was banging his head against the ground when @entity3 shot him			1
we do n't know what @entity32 's body or clothing show , other than the fatal bullet wound			1
if there are no comparable bruises or grass stains and if the bullet wound and powder residue establish that the gun was fired at very close range , this too might support a claim of self - defense			0
then there is a recorded cry for help , which , if it turns out to be the voice of @entity32 , would undercut the defense -- if the voice analysis passes scientific muster and is deemed admissible into evidence			1
there may be additional forensic evidence -- or witnesses -- of which we are now unaware , though it is unlikely there is a " smoking gun			2
" finally , there is the overarching and historically painful reality that an unarmed black teenager lies dead at the hand of an armed @entity71 man who ignored a dispatcher 's advice not to follow and engage the " suspect , " and who may have -- and this too is forensically unclear -- uttered a racial epithet while chasing him			0
these " facts " give rise to several possible scenarios of what may actually have occurred on that dark rainy night			0
under the @entity84 self - defense statute , it matters greatly what happened , most especially who " initially provoke [ d ] the use of force , " and who started the physical encounter			0
if @entity3 initially provoked the deadly encounter , then he can not invoke any " stand your ground " defense			0
he would then be under a legal obligation to " exhaust ... every reasonable means to escape			2
" though this statute is anything but a model of clarity , it does suggest that whoever " provokes " a deadly encounter has a heavy burden of justification in claiming self - defense			0
but the statute does n't define " provokes , " and that ambiguous word may hold the key to the outcome of this tragic case			1
if provocation is limited to a physical assault , and if @entity3 's account that @entity32 blindsided him with a punch is believed , then @entity3 did not provoke the encounter			1
but if provocation includes following the victim and harassing him , then @entity3 may well qualify as a provocateur			0
moreover , a jury may believe that @entity3 started the physical confrontation by grabbing @entity32			2
this would almost certainly constitute provocation			0
but to complicate matters further , even a provocateur has the legal right to defend himself under @entity84 law if he ca n't escape and if he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm , as @entity3 claims he was			0
all this goes to show how factually driven this case is under @entity84 law			2
and we do n't yet know all the facts			0
the special prosecutor , who has said she will not use a grand jury to decide whether to indict @entity3 , has an obligation to consider all the evidence and to apply the law to the facts			1
all she needs in order to indict is probable cause that a crime has been committed			2
a jury that ultimately decides whether the defendant is guilty needs much more : proof beyond a reasonable doubt			1
but what if a prosecutor concludes that there is both probable cause and a reasonable doubt ? that is the nightmare scenario that this prosecutor may well face			1
in ordinary circumstances , most prosecutors would not bring such a case , because it would be a waste of resources to indict someone who will probably be acquitted			2
but this is anything but a run - of - the - mill case			0
moreover , the @entity84 statute provides an additional layer of protection to a defendant claiming self - defense : a judge must decide whether the defendant is " immune from prosecution , " that is , if the judge believes his actions fall under the law of self - defense			0
so the following mixed outcome is certainly possible : the special prosecutor indicts ; the judge does or does n't grant immunity ; if he does n't , the jury acquits			1
many people would be unhappy with such a mixed outcome , but it is not the job of the law to make people happy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 : prosecutor in @entity32 case could face " nightmare scenario "
he says based on evidence that is public , there could be probable cause to indict
but there may not be enough evidence to remove reasonable doubt of guilt
@entity190 : many people would not be happy with such a mixed outcome
