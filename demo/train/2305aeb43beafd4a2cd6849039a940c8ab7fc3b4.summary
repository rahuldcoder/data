save the date : @entity2 has pledged to start eliminating some of its uranium stockpile on january 20 , the @entity1 said sunday			1
that gives an official start time for the six - month interim deal with @entity2 , which was first announced in november			1
" as of that day , for the first time in almost a decade , @entity2 's nuclear program will not be able to advance , and parts of it will be rolled back , while we start negotiating a comprehensive agreement to address the international community 's concerns about @entity2 's program , " @entity9 secretary of state @entity8 said in a statement sunday			1
@entity2 officials also confirmed the start date for the deal , state media reported			2
as part of the agreement , @entity2 has agreed to start eliminating its stockpile of higher levels of enriched uranium , to dismantle some infrastructure that makes higher - level uranium enrichment possible , and not to start up additional centrifuges			1
representatives from the @entity34 ' nuclear watchdog agency will also monitor @entity2 's nuclear facilities and make sure the country is taking the required steps as part of the deal			1
in exchange , some sanctions against @entity2 will be eased as part of what the @entity1 calls " modest relief			2
" @entity9 officials estimate the overall sanctions relief provided to @entity2 as part of the deal will total around $ 7 billion -- $ 4.2 billion of which consists of restricted @entity2 assets that will be freed up gradually			1
" the $ 4.2 billion in restricted @entity2 assets that @entity2 will gain access to as part of the agreement will be released in regular installments throughout the six months , " @entity8 said			2
" the final installment will not be available to @entity2 until the very last day			0
" but there 's a bipartisan push in @entity54 to tighten , rather than ease , sanctions on @entity2			0
@entity9 president @entity57 made it clear sunday that he would push back			0
" imposing additional sanctions now will only risk derailing our efforts to resolve this issue peacefully , and i will veto any legislation enacting new sanctions during the negotiation , " @entity57 said in a written statement			1
senior @entity57 administration officials echoed that sentiment sunday , but also said if @entity2 does n't make good on its promises , the @entity9 could decide to step up sanctions			1
@entity2 lawmakers have threatened to boost uranium enrichment levels if the @entity9 imposes more sanctions against the country			2
one of @entity2 's deputy foreign minister , @entity75 , told @entity76 sunday that the enactment of additional sanctions from the @entity80 would " ruin the entire agreement			1
" " we hope we will not face that , " he said			0
word of the deal 's start date drew mixed reactions from @entity88 sunday			0
" i 'm concerned that this agreement takes us down that path where sanctions pressure is relieved , but @entity2 maintains its ability to produce a nuclear weapon , " said @entity90 chairman rep. @entity89 , @entity91			2
" given these stakes , it 's regrettable that the president does not want to work with @entity54 to bolster his negotiating hand with additional sanctions , which would go into effect should @entity2 fail to meet its commitments			0
" rep. @entity105 , @entity106 , called the interim agreement a " meaningful step forward " and said new sanctions would be counterproductive			0
" we will know soon enough if @entity2 is committed to a diplomatic resolution of its nuclear program			1
if it is not , new sanctions will move with lightning speed out of the @entity54 and with my full support			0
" many obstacles remain , and i continue to be skeptical of @entity118 's willingness to abandon pursuit of nuclear weapons technology , but i am also fully convinced that we must try the diplomatic path			0
" the agreement struck in november with representatives from @entity2 , the @entity9 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 has been widely hailed as a successful interim measure to stave off an unwanted conflict over @entity118 's nuclear program			1
but after initially celebrating a diplomatic success , @entity2 had reportedly lashed out at the @entity9 for making public a modified version of the agreement that @entity118 said did not reflect its interpretation			0
it took three rounds of meetings with technical experts to hammer out the details of implementing the deal , @entity138 high representative @entity137 said in a statement sunday			0
another @entity2 deputy foreign minister , @entity148 , announced the deal 's start date at a press conference sunday , saying that his country would stop 20 % uranium enrichment at that time , the state - run @entity146 reported			1
" there 's $ 4.2 billion of @entity2 's oil income which will be released , and from the other side , the conversion of 20 % enriched material to oxide or diluting it ( will ) be carried out			2
this action on our side , and that one on theirs , will be performed within a six - month span , " he said			2
even as they hailed the start date as a significant step forward sunday , officials cautioned that the toughest negotiations are yet to come			0
" the negotiations will be very difficult , " @entity8 said , " but they are the best chance we have to be able to resolve this critical national security issue peacefully , and durably			0
