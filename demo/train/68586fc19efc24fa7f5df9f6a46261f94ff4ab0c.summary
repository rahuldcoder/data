-- @entity1 led going into the first night of the @entity2 to @entity4 yacht race after fellow super maxi @entity5 was prevented from starting on @entity7 by race officials			1
@entity9 , last year 's line honors winner @entity10 , and @entity5 were expected to dominate the 628 - mile bluewater classic with hopes of a new race record in strong southerly winds			1
but race organizers , the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , scratched @entity18 's @entity5 just three hours before the start , citing incomplete documentation			2
@entity22 's yacht had undergone modifications to extend it to 100 feet , but they fell foul of the rules , leaving an angry skipper to vent his feelings to the media			0
" we are absolutely devastated to be told at the 11th hour that we are unable to race to @entity4 , " a furious @entity22 told @entity30			2
" we 're a bit stuck for words as to why it happened , the situation , we provided the documentation -- i 've got it in my hand			0
" official @entity41 @entity2 - @entity4 website but @entity17 commodore @entity42 defended their decision , saying they had warned @entity22 his paperwork did not prove the modifications met international standards			1
" the race committee has no option but to not accept the entry of @entity5 , " @entity42 told the official race website			2
" this is the final decision of the race committee that puts safety first , " he added			0
last year 's race was also hit by a controversy after @entity10 ( now renamed @entity10 ) pipped @entity1 for line honors in a dramatic finish in @entity60			1
the winner had to survive a protest from the race committee which alleged one of its crew members had gleaned information from a tv helicopter crew about the sails being deployed by @entity9			0
without @entity5 , the 76 - strong fleet made the usual spectacular exit from @entity71 with @entity9 establishing an early advantage			0
but hopes of breaking its own race record of one day , 18 hours , 40 minutes and 10 seconds set in 2005 appeared to be fading with @entity10 , skippered by 85 - year - old @entity76 , in hot pursuit			1
behind the super maxis , the rest of the fleet is battling for handicap honors , which take into account each yacht 's dimensions and sail area .			0
