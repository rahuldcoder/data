@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 voted wednesday to repeal president @entity5 's signature health care reform law despite @entity7 objections that the move was a waste of time			1
the vote amounted to political theater because the measure is sure to die in the @entity7 - led @entity14 and the @entity3 has made clear @entity5 would veto any repeal			1
five @entity7 joined the @entity2 majority in the 244 - 185 vote			1
@entity7 leaders said a handful of their caucus members facing tough re-election battles in november might side with the @entity2 on the volatile issue			1
wednesday 's vote was the latest of more than 30 house @entity2 efforts to undermine the @entity25 , including previous @entity2 moves to repeal the measure or cut funding for various provisions			1
prior to the final vote , the @entity3 rejected a @entity7 motion that would have required any legislator supporting the repeal measure to give up government - provided health care			1
in debate on the issue this week , @entity7 noted the @entity38 ruled on june 28 to uphold the health care law 's constitutionality , which they said should end talk of repeal and instead inspire bipartisan efforts to address the nation 's weak economic recovery			1
" with millions still out of work and families struggling to make ends meet , @entity2 are responding how ? by voting to take away critical health care protections for people , " rep. @entity49 of @entity50 , the no. 2 @entity3 @entity51 , told reporters			1
voters : can we move on please ? republicans , however , said the issue remains a priority for their constituents and defended the need to combat what they call a threat to patient - focused health care and the economy			2
" it is not a game to be played , " declared @entity3 majority leader @entity66 , @entity67 , before the voting started			2
earlier , rep. @entity71 , @entity72 , told @entity1 that health care reform " happens to be the seminal issue of our time			2
" " those of us who want patient - centered health care have had two years to repeal it , " @entity71 said			2
" i think it 's kind of unreasonable to think we 're going to go away			2
" opinion polls indicate public confusion on the issue amid the sharp political divide			0
a @entity1 / @entity88 poll conducted june 28 - july 1 showed 52 % of respondents favor all or most provisions of the health care law , while at the same time , 51 % want @entity93 to repeal the entire measure			1
on both issues , @entity7 were strongly in favor of keeping the law intact while @entity2 were equally supportive of repealing or dismantling it			1
independents reflected the conflicting findings of the poll , with 56 % favoring repeal while 51 % support all or most of the law 's provisions			2
at committee hearings and on the @entity3 floor tuesday , the debate on the repeal measure devolved into repetitive opposing claims about the health care law			1
" this law is historic , but for all the wrong reasons , " argued rep. @entity112 , @entity113			0
" it reaches too far into the personal decisions of @entity117 and it puts a heavy burden on our economy and small businesses			0
it 's an example of big government at its absolute worst			0
" rep. @entity124 of @entity125 , the @entity126 chair , noted the multiple previous @entity3 votes to repeal all or part of the health reform law			2
" it is time to stop the tantrums , grow up , and work together on @entity117 ' number one priority -- creating jobs , " she said			0
another @entity51 , rep. @entity135 of @entity136 , accused @entity2 of " serving more baloney " regarding the health care law , while @entity2 members complained it was @entity5 and @entity7 who misled the public on the the measure 's cost and impact			1
some in @entity93 are urging state governments to opt out of the health care law 's provisions setting up health insurance exchanges and expanding @entity151 coverage for the poor and disabled			0
so far , a handful of states have said they will hold off on both provisions			0
the exchanges will provide consumers and businesses with options for obtaining health coverage , as required under the law 's individual mandate			0
both the exchanges and the @entity151 expansion are intended to reduce the number of uninsured @entity117			0
by opting out , state governments hope to avoid a possible increased financial burden as the health care law gets fully implemented beginning in 2014			0
opponents of the law also want to obstruct progress on implementation as much as possible while they try to get it repealed or dismantled			0
" it starts a process that we believe has to be repealed because we ca n't afford it , " conservative sen. @entity175 , @entity72 - @entity176 , told @entity1 on wednesday			0
he is leading the state opt - out effort			2
" the bottom line is , our country is broke , " @entity175 said			0
" this is going to cost trillions of dollars			0
it 's going to diminish the quality and access to health care			0
" however , analysts and industry experts contend health care reform will happen out of necessity , whether through the @entity193 or the momentum it already has created since being passed over two years ago			1
how are you affected by the health care ruling ? share your views in the @entity198 according to a report by @entity200 , 14 states and the @entity0 have made " significant progress " toward implementing reforms , while another 19 states have made " moderate progress , " leaving 17 states -- or about a third -- that have yet to change their laws or take other steps toward implementation			2
the report , titled " implications of the @entity117 @entity212 , " says all players in the health care industry -- state governments , hospitals , insurance companies , employers and drug companies -- need to participate in the emerging reform process or risk getting left behind			0
@entity175 appeared to concede that reality wednesday , saying the goal is to " give the states more flexibility to help individuals own their own health insurance , policies that they can keep from job to job , and hopefully into retirement			0
and a lot of states have begun that process			0
" he also echoed an emerging @entity2 talking point that praises what @entity5 and @entity7 sought to achieve through health care reform pushed through @entity93 with no @entity2 support			1
" we appreciate some of the goals of the president , " @entity175 said			0
" we need every @entity117 to have access to affordable health insurance			0
the best way to do that is at ... the state level that respects the relationship between the patient and the doctor			0
" @entity7 also point to a state solution that worked -- the health care reforms implemented by @entity2 presidential candidate @entity252 when he was governor of @entity253			1
throughout tuesday 's committee hearings and floor debate on health care reform , @entity7 legislators repeatedly noted how @entity252 's @entity253 plan served as a model for the federal plan @entity2 seek to eliminate , including the individual mandate detested by conservatives			1
@entity252 now pledges to repeal the federal law , a necessary position for any @entity2 in today 's hyper - partisan @entity2 political environment			1
he argues his @entity253 law was right for the state but never intended as a federal solution , but he also calls for keeping some popular provisions of what is known as @entity193 , such as preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions			1
what the @entity38 ruled on health care ' tax ' the health care issue has been among the most divisive of @entity5 's presidency			1
conservative anger over the measure helped launch the tea party movement , and conservative groups joined with industry groups to fund a giant public pressure campaign against the legislation			2
some provisions already have brought popular benefits , such as the one on pre-existing conditions			0
the bulk of the health care law will take effect in 2014			0
in its ruling , the @entity38 said the individual mandate -- the requirement that all people have insurance -- is constitutional under the government 's taxing authority , and @entity2 have jumped on that to characterize the provision as a tax increase on middle - class @entity117			1
what the health care ruling means to you @entity5 and @entity7 respond that only people who can afford health insurance but choose not to get it would have to pay , amounting to about 1 % of the population			1
the continued @entity2 attacks seek to bolster public opposition to the law and force @entity7 to publicly defend it			1
@entity2 have made clear that the goal is to inspire voters to rally against the law and @entity5 in the november presidential election			1
" if you give us more elected representatives to fix this problem , we will fix this problem in 2013 , " @entity319 chairman @entity318 , @entity320 , said tuesday in an interview with @entity322			0
the @entity3 formally notified @entity3 leaders on monday that @entity5 will veto any repeal bill that manages to reach his desk , saying repeal " would cost millions of hard - working middle - class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve			2
" " the last thing the @entity93 should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class , " a @entity3 statement said			0
but @entity2 called for eliminating the law and starting over on the complex issue that affects every @entity117			1
" that 's why we 've voted over 30 times to repeal it , defund it , replace it			1
and we are resolved to have this law go away and we 're gon na do everything we can to stop it , " house speaker @entity348 , @entity349 , told reporters tuesday			2
how will you be affected by the health care ruling ? share your thoughts in the @entity198			2
