-- following the shootings at @entity13 , @entity14 , in november 2009 , the attempted car bomb in @entity4 in may and a number of other domestic cases , including the recent arrest of a @entity9 - @entity2 teenager in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity2 security agencies are sharply focused on the potential " radicalization " of @entity2 - @entity16 and how to prevent it			1
many look across the @entity19 to the experience of @entity21			1
following the july 2005 attacks on @entity24 's transport system , a " counter-radicalization " strategy known as @entity26 was introduced			0
dubbed prevent for short , the strategy aims to intervene in the dynamics of @entity32 communities to win over hearts and minds and secure allegiance to @entity37 liberal democracy			1
first , it seeks to sponsor moderate @entity32 organizations to oppose " the ideology of violent extremism " ( a @entity21 government phrase that is deliberately obscure ) and promote accommodation with the @entity44			1
hundreds of millions of pounds of government funding have been made available to those willing to take on this task			2
second , it seeks to profile individuals suspected of drifting toward " radicalization , " that is , the adoption of extremist ideas			0
through an elaborate system of surveillance involving teachers and youth workers among others , would - be radicals are identified and given counseling , mentoring and religious instruction in an attempt to divert them from their extremist views			1
many in @entity68 tout a @entity38 - like program as an essential weapon in what they see as the " war within , " the next phase of @entity2 's @entity74			1
governments can not wait , they argue , until terrorist ideas turn into terrorist actions ; there has to be some form of intervention earlier in the process to discourage those ideas from circulating			0
and in a liberal society , where ideas themselves can not easily be criminalized , something like @entity38 is a viable and necessary alternative , they argue			0
with the @entity2 government already dedicating vast resources to profiling would - be extremists and recruiting @entity32 groups as homeland security partners , the building blocks of an @entity2 version of @entity38 are already in place			1
but in @entity21 , the harm done by @entity38 has far outweighed any advantages			1
i spent a year researching the effects of @entity38 on @entity102 's @entity32 communities			1
i got documents detailing the full extent of the surveillance involved and spoke to community leaders , grassroots activists , women and young people			2
there was overwhelming concern that the policy construed the entire @entity21 @entity32 population -- roughly two million citizens -- as uniquely and collectively responsible for preventing terrorist incidents			1
that perception was graphically illustrated by @entity26 funding , which was allocated in direct proportion to the number of @entity16 in each local authority area , counted according to the 2001 census ( the first to include a question on religion )			0
as it became clear that the program constructed @entity16 as a suspect community , more and more of the government 's @entity32 community partners began to disengage			1
in addition , sponsoring moderates to promote the government 's anti-extremist message meant , in practice , funding religious scholars and imams to advance an official interpretation of @entity136			2
in this way , @entity138 involved state intervention in theological debates about the true meaning of religion , a paradoxical violation of the very secular principles that @entity16 were otherwise being exhorted to uphold			0
more generally , the government 's search for moderate @entity16 often seemed like a search for @entity16 who agreed with it , which meant that " moderate " @entity16 were quite hard to find			0
the vague language of " moderate " and " extremist " was easily exploited to silence nonconformist views , whether from an @entity154 ideological viewpoint or simply individual opinions about @entity21 's foreign policy			1
this in turn undermined precisely the sort of radical democratic dissent that might have been helpful in winning people away from those who said democracy was pointless , particularly as teachers and youth workers were pressured to inform the police of young @entity16 expressing radical views			0
the level of distrust and alienation that @entity38 generated among @entity32 communities has by now become clear , leading to the recent announcement of a review of the policy by the new coalition government			1
but it remains to be seen whether policymakers in @entity24 and @entity68 will interpret @entity38 's failures as resulting from the bad implementation of a fundamentally sound idea or as the inevitable product of the program 's flawed assumptions			0
the underlying problem with the @entity38 strategy is that it assumes that a democratic government can impose political or religious opinions on its own citizens			2
in the 21st century , such an approach is bound to backfire			0
@entity37 governments are right to recognize that political legitimacy is a key asset in countering terrorism			0
after all , in the majority of cases since 9/11 , including the recent @entity11 arrest , the original intelligence has come from @entity32 communities			2
but governments will find it easier to gain the allegiance of @entity16 if they take democratic principles more seriously when it comes to criticism of their foreign policy and refrain from demonizing whole communities			0
if , on the other hand , they launch ideological campaigns against a minority among their own citizens , they inevitably conjure memories of the last century 's witch hunts of communists and black nationalists			0
and then any hope of winning hearts and minds is lost			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity221 : some urge a @entity2 government program aimed at extreme @entity32 views
he says a @entity21 program known as " prevent " has done more harm than good
he says government should not target the entire @entity32 community
government interference in religious debate and views is *unwise* , he says
