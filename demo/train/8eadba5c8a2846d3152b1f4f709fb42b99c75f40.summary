-- there are plenty of country songs about how to be a man			2
one way is to face the music , and two country crooners did that on thursday			2
@entity9 and @entity10 came out as being gay			1
@entity12 went first , in interviews with @entity14 and @entity15			1
his revelation inspired @entity10 to do go public as well			1
@entity10 posted a message to @entity19 , thanking @entity9 for breaking the ice			1
he preferred telling his fans directly , from the comfort of home , to sitting down with the press , he said			2
but an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did			1
the reporter bumped into @entity10 in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner			1
" it was in that moment that i knew that i 'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else , " @entity10 told fans			1
he also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article			2
country and @entity42 in the genre of country , thursday 's tune was a tough one to sing , @entity10 said			1
" being a gay , male country artist is not the best thing			2
" at age 26 , he 's had a long career , having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky , pre-voice - change alto pipes , according to his biography on @entity54			2
but currently , he 's hitting snags			2
rumors about his sexual orientation have been going around , he said , and he thinks major music labels may have thumbed their noses at him over it			1
" i knew something was wrong when no major label wanted to sit down and have a meeting and listen to the new stuff , " he said			2
in his video , he turned directly to fans with his latest song , giving them a preview on his laptop of the music video to " say you will , " which is still in edit			1
facing fans on monday " today , i get to tell the world that i 'm an out , proud and happy gay man , " he told " people			1
" but he 's worried how fans will take the news			1
he may find out in just three days , when he performs at the " @entity79 of @entity80 , " the @entity81			2
it 's home to the @entity83			2
@entity9 is playing a @entity85 charity bash for children in need along with @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
the @entity81 has said the concert would be sold out			0
@entity9 , 52 , is hopeful he wo n't face outrage , because he thinks attitudes are changing in the country scene			1
singer @entity96 came out in 2010 and the open - minded @entity97 has a song titled " @entity99 " that was just named the @entity102 song of the year			0
" i felt so proud of my city , " he said			0
" i hope that trend continues ; i pray it does			0
" faith and fear as a child , @entity9 , a devout @entity108 , was stricken with fear over his sexual feelings			1
" i was 10 , sitting in church and horrified that i might be a homosexual			0
whatever that word meant , i knew that i probably was one , " @entity9 told " people			1
" " and i know there 's a lot of those kids still out there			0
telling my story is an opportunity to help just one of them			0
" he started coming out to family members in his 20s			0
but the " @entity128 " singer , who had a number of hits in the 1990s , kept the news close to the vest			1
it was n't until he attended a @entity133 seminar in 2009 that he decided to become more public , he told the magazine			0
" i realized i had an incredible story that could possibly help someone 's son or daughter or grandchild 's life not be as difficult as mine has been , " he said			0
" maybe they would n't have to go through as much pain and suffering			0
it 's time to tell my truth			0
" dropping hints ? some of the conflict between @entity9 's sexuality and his faith bled through a song he published last year -- " @entity150			1
" a sign with the word " equality " has the most prominent place in the music video			0
" yeah , praying 's just a waste of time , so why even start , " the last verse begins			0
" the good lord ai n't got time for guys like me			0
@entity164 's something you wo n't ever be			0
" a handwritten sign appears in that verse			0
it reads , " i 'm a sinner			0
" @entity9 has since reconciled who he is with @entity170 , he said			1
he loves @entity170 , and @entity170 loves him back			0
one of the lies he told himself , he said to " @entity15 , " was that he ca n't be gay and be in country music at the same time			0
now , he thinks that 's not true .			1

@entity9 broke the news first with interviews with " people " and " et "
that inspired @entity10 , but an encounter with a reporter also gave him a push
@entity10 fears @entity185 is giving him the cold *shoulder* over his sexual orientation
@entity9 is also worried , but thinks things are changing for the better in the scene
