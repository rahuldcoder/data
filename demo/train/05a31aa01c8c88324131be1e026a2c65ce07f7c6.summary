-- the $ 1 billion photo - sharing app @entity2 -- once named " app of the year " by @entity5 -- has now " jumped the shark , " according to @entity5 's marketing chief @entity6			1
and not only is @entity6 trashing the service ( in a brief message to @entity5 enthusiast @entity9 ) , he has also deleted his @entity2 account ( @ schiller ) entirely ( much like some thousands of other users			1
) what got @entity6 so upset ? not the billion - dollar acquisition by @entity14 , apparently			0
" it ' jumped the shark ' when it went to @entity19 , " was all the @entity5 executive wrote to @entity9 thursday			2
@entity2 launched its @entity19 version earlier this month			2
in the first five days , the @entity19 app saw five million users sign up			1
that 's not huge compared to the 30 million @entity25 users , but the rate of growth was stunning -- and strongly contributed to @entity29 's decision to offer @entity30 $ 1 billion for the app. what exactly @entity6 meant is unclear			1
how can five million new users on a slightly different platform make an app " jump the shark " ? many @entity38 users have seen their follower counts swell , but it 's hard to see what 's wrong with that			0
you would n't be hard pressed to see further evidence that the " nuclear war " @entity49 vowed to wage against @entity19 is being continued by his successors at @entity5			1
if a favored @entity51 app launching on @entity19 is enough to earn a rebuke from a top @entity5 executive , that may serve as a warning to other app makers who are currently on @entity51 alone			1
remember , @entity5 is a company where practically every executive comment is a calculated one			0
( naturally , we 've reached out to @entity5 for comment and will let you know if we hear back			0
) but it 's got to be galling for @entity2			0
just four months ago , @entity6 was congratulating them on his @entity64 feed , where he also plugged his own @entity2 account : @ pschiller : congrats to @ foofighters @ instagram and all the @entity69 rewind 2011 winners ! ( btw : @ schiller on @entity2 ; - > ) follow that account link now , and all you 'll see is an @entity2 error page			2
you could well argue that with @entity29 's backing and $ 1 billion in the bank , @entity30 et al have no more need for @entity5 's patronage			2
but the majority of @entity2 's users are still on the @entity25 , and the @entity25 's handlers apparently just turned hostile			0
update : @entity9 reached out to @entity6 for clarification , and got the following via email : @entity2 is a great app and community			1
but one of the things i really liked about @entity2 was that it was a small community of early adopters sharing their photographs			1
now that it has grow [ sic ] much larger the signal to noise ratio is different			0
that is n't necessarily good or bad , it 's just not what i originally had fun with			0
what do you make of @entity6 's comments ? can @entity2 patch things up ? let us know your thoughts in the comments			2
see the original article on @entity0			0

five million users signed up in the first five days of @entity2 launching on *android*
@entity5 's marketing chief @entity6 did n't like the app going to @entity19 , deleted his account
@entity6 : i really liked that the app was a small community of early adopters
