-- the @entity1 has placed 12 countries on its @entity3 , a list of countries where journalists have been killed and their killers have not been found			1
the organization 's third annual compilation , released tuesday , cites @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
the index , which covers 2000 through 2009 , describes the countries as places " where journalists are murdered on a recurring basis and governments are unable or unwilling to prosecute the killers			2
" leading the field for the third consecutive year was @entity10 , where all 88 journalist killings remain unsolved , the committee said			1
all but seven cases involve local journalists , " the vast majority of whom " were targeted by insurgents , it said on its website			0
but last year marked the first since the @entity41 - led invasion of @entity10 in 2003 that no killing directly related to a journalist 's work was documented there by the organization			1
still , four journalists were killed in crossfire in 2009 , it said			2
@entity10 's @entity50 was 2.794 unsolved journalist killings per million inhabitants , nearly triple the rate of any other country			1
@entity11 ranked second , " reflecting insurgents ' routine use of violence to control the news media , " @entity1 said			1
the incidence of fatal , unpunished violence against journalists has increased in the @entity12 , @entity11 , @entity17 and @entity18 , it said			2
but @entity67 and @entity14 , long among the world 's deadliest nations for the news media , each showed improvements , with @entity67 moving off the list , the committee reported			1
" we 've heard repeated pledges from governments that the killers of journalists will face justice , but until these promises are fulfilled , media will continue to be targeted by those who believe they are above the law and immune from consequences , " said @entity70 , @entity1 's executive director			1
the group noted that many of the countries on the index present themselves as democracies with functioning law enforcement -- nations such as @entity21 , @entity17 , the @entity12 , and @entity18			0
the index includes only those nations with five or more unsolved cases			0
in the @entity12 , 30 journalists and two media support workers were killed in @entity98 province , it said , boosting the country from sixth to third on the index			2
" the massacre overshadowed gains that @entity12 authorities had made , winning convictions in two journalist murders , " the committee said			0
in @entity17 , which ranked eighth , three journalists were killed last year , bringing the country 's 10 - year total of unsolved killings to 18 , it said			1
@entity18 moved from 11th to ninth , reflecting continuing violence against crime reporters there , it said			0
in @entity18 , self - censorship is widespread , it said			0
many nations on the list have seen a reduction in the flow of information			0
in fourth - ranked @entity13 , with 10 unsolved killings , " many of the country 's most senior journalists have fled into exile , " the @entity1 said			1
" our goal in compiling this index is to spur leaders in these nations to action , " said @entity129			0
" many of these cases are solvable			0
the perpetrators have been identified but authorities lack the political will to prosecute			0
" @entity1 released the index to coincide with a summit on impunity being held tuesday and wednesday in @entity143			2
the index calculates the number of unsolved journalist killings as a percentage of the country 's population			1
only nations with five or more unsolved cases were included			0
@entity1 includes only those killings that are considered to have been deliberate attacks against specific journalists in relation to their work			1
it does not tally cases of journalists killed in combat or while carrying out other dangerous assignments			2
" the only thing you can say about it is that the murder of journalists gets worse and worse , and the problem is that governments around the world are not interested in finding the perpetrators , " said @entity161 , editor of the magazine @entity162 and the @entity163 in free - press studies at the @entity165			0
" too often they blame journalists for acting out of line			0
