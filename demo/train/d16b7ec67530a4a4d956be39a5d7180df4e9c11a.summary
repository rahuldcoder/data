-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 made headlines when he backed away from his opposition to same - sex marriage in @entity2			1
although he had initially indicated that he would challenge the recent court decision , @entity1 reversed course and announced that he would follow the law of his state			0
most pundits agreed that @entity1 's decision would enable him to expand his margin of victory in the upcoming gubernatorial election and improve his chances of emerging as the leading @entity17 presidential candidate for 2016			2
yet some commentators think this might cause objections to a @entity1 candidacy in the @entity17 primaries from social conservatives who remain firmly against same - sex marriage			1
in their view , @entity1 is an outlier , a @entity17 courting centrist voters who is going against the grain of the party			2
" this would suit him a lot better if he were running as a @entity34 , " one @entity17 told @entity30			0
but there is a strong likelihood that within a few years , @entity1 might not be as much of an anomaly as they think			0
the progress on same - sex marriage has been rapid			1
while the @entity42 defined marriage as only being between a man and woman , many states moved forward in allowing same - sex couples to enter into marriage or civil unions			1
prodded by vice president @entity50 , president @entity49 said in may 2012 that he supported the right of same - sex partners to enter into marriage			2
in june this year , the @entity53 ruled that @entity42 was unconstitutional and that fsame - sex couples had the right to federal benefits that were normally accorded to heterosexual married couples			2
one of the most important reasons behind the success of this movement has been the decision to join the gay rights cause to a traditional family values issue promoted by the right : marriage			1
in recent decades , the gay rights movement has turned its attention away from issues of individual sexuality and liberation , and toward the right to marry			1
the civil right to enter into a partnership that conservatives have extolled for decades has been extremely important politically			0
in the early 1960s , civil rights leaders like the rev. @entity76 won enormous support by connecting the cause of @entity81 - @entity80 freedom to traditional @entity80 values			2
in august 1963 , during the famous march on @entity83 , @entity76 and others delivered their powerful speeches in front of the @entity87 , a reminder of how desegregationâ € ” and then voting rightsâ € ” were a fulfillment of the @entity80 promise rather than a rejection of traditional values			0
unlike abortion after the @entity53 's @entity95 decision in 1973 , there is much stronger potential for same - sex marriage to become incorporated into the national landscape and removed from mainstream political debate			1
as the courts and states have moved forward at a rapid pace on this issue , the rest of the nation has not been far behind			0
public polls have shown growing support for same - sex marriage throughout the country , including in " red areas " of the country			1
last march , a poll by @entity114 and the @entity115 found that 52 % of @entity17 and independents who lean @entity17 under the age of 50 supported same - sex marriage and 81 % of people under 30 were in favor			1
those trends have only intensified in recent months			0
we have also seen more frequent images of same - sex marriage in popular culture			1
in one of the most popular comedy shows of the past few years , " @entity134 , " one of the three families that is followed in this pseudo-documentary is a gay couple raising an adopted child			0
while their sexuality is part of the story , it is remarkable how most of the shows do n't center on this issue but instead on the normal ups and downs of family life			0
this season , the show began with these two characters , @entity148 and @entity149 , becoming engaged in the wake of @entity152 's decision to allow same - sex marriage			1
a growing number of @entity17 have already backed away from their opposition to same - sex marriage			1
@entity1 is just one of those who have changed the tone of the party on this cultural question -- a group that includes sens. @entity162 and @entity163 and former vice president @entity164 -- in an era when polarization has become stronger on almost every other issue			0
as @entity170 adviser @entity169 said , " opposing the freedom to marry is a loser for our party and serves to drive away a growing number of voters who have turned the page			0
" so , even though @entity1 is taking a risk through his recent announcement , the odds are that many other @entity17 wo n't be far behind			2
the gay rights movement has profoundly shifted the debate and advanced the cause of gay rights far beyond what anyone had imagined just a few years ago			1
by taking one of the most familiar and central conservative arguments of our era , marriage , and embracing it as one of their own , the movement has gained legitimacy for the right of gay @entity80 to build their own families			0
there will be huge pressure on @entity17 in the coming years to get on the right side of this issue and movement activists have made it easier for leaders in the @entity17 to come around to their side			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			0

@entity1 chose not to appeal decision allowing same - sex marriage in @entity2
@entity209 : gay rights movement was wise to focus on marriage issue
by marrying their cause to family values , they won over some in @entity17 , he says
@entity209 : same - sex marriage is unlikely to be *source* of continuing *conflict*
