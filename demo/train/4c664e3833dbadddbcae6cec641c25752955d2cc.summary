-- @entity1 scored the winner as @entity3 beat 10 - man @entity5 2 - 1 tuesday to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity7 3 - 2 on aggregate after a pulsating match which turned on the controversial dismissal of @entity11 just before the hour mark			1
@entity5 had just gone ahead on the night through a @entity14 own goal when the @entity16 midfielder attempted to control a high clearance from his defense			2
but @entity11 's foot was high and his studs caught @entity3 's @entity21 in his midriff as he moved forward to intercept the ball			1
@entity26 referee @entity25 ± r then stunned the @entity27 by showing a red card to @entity11 as he recovered from the collision			2
@entity5 manager @entity30 charged down from his touchline seat to protest and as @entity11 eventually parted the field he was given a consolation pat by @entity3 manager @entity34			1
it was the cue for @entity3 , who had offered little in attack until then , to press forward and the man advantage soon paid in the 66th minute			2
substitute @entity39 found space outside the penalty box to unleash a curling and unstoppable shot past @entity43 , the highlight for sure of the @entity46 's stuttering progress with the @entity3 giants since his summer signing			1
two minutes later and @entity5 's worst nightmare was complete as old boy @entity1 , relatively quiet until then , connected with @entity52 's clever cross to score at the far post			1
@entity1 pointedly did not celebrate but his goal was decisive , meaning @entity5 had to score two more to progress			1
how @entity3 won they made a brave fist of it , @entity3 goalkeeper @entity58 having to produce fine saves from @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 @entity63 , surprisingly left out of the @entity5 starting line up , also hooked a chance over , but at the other end fellow substitute @entity66 rattled the home woodwork			1
at the end it was @entity3 who were celebrating but @entity34 showed some surprising modesty in victory			2
" the best team lost , independent of the sending off , " he told @entity74			0
" we did n't deserve to win and did n't play well			0
" @entity30 refused to attend the post-game press conference , because he had been left " very distraught " by @entity11 's dismissal , according to his assistant @entity81			2
" it was a great performance marred by the wrong decision , " added @entity81			0
@entity1 had received a warm welcome from home fans on his return to @entity27 , while @entity30 sprang a surprise with the omission of @entity63 , giving starts to 39 - year - old @entity90 , playing his 1,000th game for club and country , @entity11 and @entity94			1
it was @entity94 who shone in the opening half , with his darting runs causing the @entity3 defense constant problems			0
he nearly scored on the follow up as @entity62 's header hit the post and was later denied by @entity58 again			0
the second half also started promisingly for @entity5 and it was @entity94 's flick which was deflected past @entity58 by the unfortunate @entity107 international @entity14 in the 48th minute			0
his goal won the @entity110 clash against @entity111 saturday , but once @entity11 had departed it did not take long for his teammates to be celebrating again and their fine recent run continues			0
in the night 's other last 16 tie , @entity114 beat @entity116 3 - 0 to progress 5 - 2 on aggregate			1
after a 2 - 2 draw in @entity121 three weeks ago in the first leg , the @entity119 champions were always on top through goals by @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			1
@entity114 coach @entity128 is bidding to emulate the achievement of the 1997 side who won the @entity7 but is guarding against optimism			0
" there are still lots of strong teams in the competition , " he told gathered reporters " we are just delighted with the result and i am proud of the team			0
" " the whole @entity7 campaign has gone like clockwork and this was an unbelievable 90 minutes from us			0
