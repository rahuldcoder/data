@entity0 , @entity1 -- championship leader @entity2 spun out of the @entity3 to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in @entity6 on october 21			1
a disconsolate @entity2 leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in @entity0			1
rookie @entity2 can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race , but saw his 12 - point lead cut to four by @entity14 team - mate @entity13 in @entity0			1
the @entity15 finished second behind @entity17 's @entity16 , who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of @entity2			1
the young @entity20 started the race in pole position and at one stage led @entity16 by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions			1
however , the 22 - year - old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires , which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let @entity30 's @entity16 take the lead			1
and when @entity32 -- who won in @entity34 last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane , he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go			2
@entity16 and @entity13 both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps , with the @entity44 going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both @entity2 and @entity13			1
@entity48 's team - mate @entity47 was third , while fourth place was claimed by @entity51 's @entity50 , who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in @entity34 behind the safety car while @entity2 was cleared of any wrongdoing			1
@entity56 's @entity55 was fifth in a @entity57 ahead of @entity50 's team - mate @entity58 , while @entity60 's @entity59 was seventh for @entity61 and @entity62 of @entity63 took the final point for @entity65			1
@entity2 was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season			1
" i 'm sorry for the team but i can still do it , do n't worry , " he said			2
" when i got out of the car i was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year , and to do it on the way into the pits was not something i usually do			0
" you can not go through life without making mistakes			0
but i am over it and we look forward to @entity6			0
the team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there , and we still have points in the bag			1
" we were having a great race and we did n't know if it was going to rain or not			0
the tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath			0
when i came into the pits it was like ice , i could n't do anything about it			0
" @entity14 boss @entity96 refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin - off			1
" it 's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this			2
it has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another @entity3 , " @entity96 said			0
" i do n't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did @entity2			2
but the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance			0
that 's what made the difference			2
" it was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier , but would it have made a difference ? all the top teams -- @entity17 and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire			2
" @entity13 , who qualified for the race in fourth , is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles			1
" the result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure , " he said			0
" i think the championship will still be very difficult because i know it will not be easy to take four points from @entity2			1
" i need something dramatic if i want to win			0
with a normal race it will be impossible			0
" @entity16 added : " we are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race			2
" hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend			0
it is not just up to us though , we saw today that anything can happen , but we are back in the championship			0
