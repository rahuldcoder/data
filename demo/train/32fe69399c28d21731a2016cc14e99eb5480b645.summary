-- when the @entity2 shut down @entity3 last month , it was n't just @entity3 users ' files that went offline			1
the move prompted changes in the way other file - hosting sites share content and shook up anti-abuse departments across the industry			1
since the federal crackdown , third - party aggregate sites no longer link to @entity3 's video host , @entity3 , which has also been shut down			1
file host videobb did not respond to questions from @entity0 regarding its anti-abuse policies , but links to the site 's content were noticeably absent from sites like @entity24 following @entity3 's shutdown			1
direct links to @entity28 's movies and tv shows that were available less than a month ago are now gone			0
the change suggests videobb is stepping up anti-abuse efforts in order to avoid the fate of @entity3 , a @entity36 - based site which is accused of knowingly hosting illegally pirated material			1
it would be almost impossible for videobb to completely eliminate illegal content , but just the effort to do so may be enough to shield it from criminal charges			0
another file - sharing site , @entity45 , voluntarily shut down monday			1
the site 's founder told @entity48 that recent legal action against @entity3 and other similar services was behind his decision			2
the @entity2 has accused @entity3 of willfully breaking copyright law and trying to cover up its actions by hiding illegal materials from the site 's public page			2
federal prosecutors said the company offered financial incentives for users to illegally upload movies and television shows			0
it also accused @entity3 officials of discouraging the legitimate use of the site for personal storage by deleting content that was not regularly downloaded			2
the indictment alleges the company has denied copyright holders an estimated $ 500 million and that those indicted have earned roughly $ 175 million in the process			0
attorneys for @entity3 have denied the charges			0
a @entity2 representative said in an e-mail the agency will only pursue cases like @entity3 's where there was " sufficient evidence of willful criminal conduct			1
" that means videobb will likely be safe from criminal charges as long as it continues removing illegal content from third - party aggregate sites			1
if other companies follow suit , the @entity2 will have accomplished what some have suggested was its primary goal -- making an example of @entity3 to convince other file hosts to step up anti-piracy enforcement			2
however for some , the elimination of @entity3 as a file - hosting option has made vetting pirated content more difficult			1
@entity102 , a spokesman for @entity105 - based file host @entity103 , said the company 's anti-abuse department has been working overtime since the day last month when @entity3 went offline			1
the workload is not caused by an increased emphasis on removing copyrighted material , he said , but is necessary to vet a massive influx of files from new customers -- @entity3 's customers			1
@entity102 said the company has not made any changes or improvements to its anti-abuse policies in the wake of the @entity3 scandal			2
he said it was n't necessary because @entity103 was already among the toughest in the industry			0
@entity103 has a three - strike policy for copyright offenders , after which the site deletes users ' accounts and all of their files , a tactic which has proved unpopular with ousted users			2
" there 's some trash talk online , but we 're not sad about those comments , " @entity102 said			0
" we like bad press from pirates			0
" @entity103 uses a variety of technical tools to catch abusers , but the site also uses a basic search method identical to what might be employed by any home user			2
@entity102 said @entity103 technicians type words like " movies , free download " into search engines to look for illegal movie and tv show downloads on the site			1
the process can be tedious for the 17 - person team			0
while they comprise nearly a third of @entity103 's staff , @entity102 said it is impossible for them to check each of the 400,000 files uploaded to @entity103 each day			0
he estimates about 5 percent of all files are illegal , but his team can only catch and delete about 1 percent of all uploaded files			0
@entity102 said it has been even more difficult to keep up with incoming content since @entity3 's shutdown because of all the new customers			1
however despite the increased difficulty , he said @entity103 's commitment to legitimate file - hosting remains the same			1
@entity102 said @entity103 wants to ensure its new customers understand its business model			0
" we do n't provide any incentive to upload illegal content , " he said			0
" we are determined to show them we do n't tolerate that			0

third - party aggregate sites no longer link to @entity3 's video host , @entity3
the *demise* of @entity3 as a file - hosting option has made vetting pirated content more difficult
@entity103 technicians type words like " movies , free download " into search engines
