the anti-abortion group that recently revealed two videos from a secret investigation into abortion clinics released a third on thursday			1
the group , @entity4 , previewed it first to @entity6 , providing what appears to be full footage and an edited version			1
the new , secretly recorded video focuses on the @entity11 in @entity12			1
two other videos , released earlier this week , focused on the dr. @entity14 in @entity16 and the @entity18 - based @entity17			1
with the new video , live action levels the same claim it did in the previous two : that abortion clinic workers admit or suggest they 're willing to kill babies who are born alive after botched abortions			1
" what we 're alleging is there is a federal @entity27			2
and there are numerous state laws that protect infants , " @entity4 founder and president @entity31 told @entity6 in an exclusive interview			1
" so we 're alleging that there is potentially illegal activity going on in these clinics			1
" @entity4 has been accused of pushing a hardline anti-abortion agenda using dubious tactics , including secret recordings			1
they 've also been accused of heavily editing videos to achieve a desired effect			1
" our agenda is the truth here			1
the truth about the brutality of abortion			2
and the truth that we believe every person deserves human rights			2
and that women can do better than this			2
i 'm very clear about that			2
" the third release could prove potentially more controversial and helpful to the anti-abortion movement than the previous two productions			1
@entity58 is a far more conservative state on abortion than @entity16 or @entity18			1
last year , @entity58 attempted to pass what some called one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation			1
it is on hold pending a legal challenge			2
@entity4 's chief told @entity6 the group plans to release three more videos in coming weeks			1
the liberal - leaning media watchdog @entity70 said on its website this week that the videos are timed to coincidewith the trial of dr. @entity74			1
he is accused of performing illegal late - term abortions in @entity77			1
@entity74 's lawyer says he 's innocent			2
in all of the @entity4 videos , a pregnant woman meets with workers at an abortion clinic and pretends to want an abortion			1
in each case , the woman is actually working undercover for @entity4			1
and in each case , the pregnant woman secretly records her conversations with those workers -- who are unaware they are being recorded			2
the video shot inside the @entity12 medical group features three workers			1
the conversations on it do not prove any wrongdoing by any of @entity98 's staff			2
dr. @entity99 , part owner of the @entity12 facility , maintained that his clinic follows all applicable abortion laws			1
" we have not had the opportunity to review the video or transcript of the video reportedly recorded in our office because it has not been provided to us , " @entity99 said in a statement to @entity6			1
" however , the details of the video as described do not reflect the policies and procedures at @entity11			1
@entity11 strictly adheres to all applicable state and federal laws regarding the delivery of abortion care , " he added			1
@entity6 has reached out to the various local , state and federal health and law enforcement agencies to determine if any will investigate @entity4 's claims against the @entity12 medical group			1
@entity6 has not yet received a response			2
@entity124 passed and president @entity125 signed the " @entity27 " in 2002			2
the law states that any infant born alive , including any in an abortion attempt , must receive legal protections			0
doctors must also work to save their lives			0
the law does not explicitly state that it is illegal to discuss hypotheticals of what might happen in such matters			0
in the recording from inside the @entity12 facility , one woman identifies herself as dr. @entity140 , a chief resident			1
the doctor carefully walks the pregnant woman through the abortion process , to which the woman rolls through a series of questions			0
at one point , the woman asks if she could go into labor , at home , over the two - day process			0
" that would be a lot less common , but theoretically it would be a possibility , " the doctor said			0
moments later , the pregnant woman asks : what would happen if she went into labor and the fetus emerged alive			0
" it wo n't , " the doctor said			0
" but if it , if it does survive , like what would you do , like ? " the woman asks			0
" nothing , " the doctor responds			0
" so at this gestational age , um , there 's really not the possibility			0
a fetus is not developed enough that it can survive outside of the uterus , at this point			0
" " so you would n't like resuscitate it , or like give it anything to help it survive ? " the woman asks			0
" no , " the doctor says			0
" even if you were pregnant at the same time with a very desired pregnancy , and you had the exact same thing happen , spontaneously on your own at 23 week two days in the hospital , we would still say , ' do you want us to try to resuscitate ? our chances are n't good			0
' but it 's kinda one of those things that if it makes the parents feel better , we 'll give it a shot between 23 to 24 weeks			0
" later on tape , another women identified by @entity4 as a counselor , makes similar comments			1
@entity31 said her group wants investigations			0
" we 're looking for prosecutions where there may be criminal acts going on			0
we 're looking for the de-licensing of these so - called doctors and their clinics so they 're no longer allowed to operate			1
and we 're also looking for the de-funding of any federal or state or local taxpayer dollars that are going to these acts , " she said			0
@entity6 spoke with @entity213 on wednesday			0
she acknowledged previously doing a resident rotation at @entity215 but was not aware of the existence of the video or any role in it			2
when informed about the video , @entity213 responded , " that 's interesting , " adding that she 'd need to go back and look over records of a conversation with the pregnant woman in question			2
@entity213 was familiar with laws that mandates a doctor must work to save a fetus that emerged alive during an abortion			2
" you have to evaluate for the ability to do so			0
absolutely , " @entity213 said			0
asked if she could recall ever saying otherwise , @entity213 responded : " no. not that i remember			0
" @entity213 is a physician resident in training at @entity233			0
@entity234 , vice president of public relations , spoke with @entity6 in a phone interview			0
" the issue of what , let 's say dr. @entity213 , would or would n't do , according to @entity4 -- she 's a resident			1
and a resident is not going to do anything without being supervised , obviously , in any decisionmaking from the perspective of the attending physician in the office , " @entity234 said			0
" the second thing is that , when you look at @entity58 , some of our statutes ... is that , by law , if a fetus was deemed as viable or showed signs of viability , a second physician has to be in the room who 's going to assume the care of that fetus			0
" @entity234 added that " nowhere do i see where she says that ' hey , if your baby comes out alive , i 'm ... going to let it die			0
