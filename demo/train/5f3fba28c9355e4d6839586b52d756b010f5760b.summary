-- one of about every 12 babies born in the @entity4 in 2008 was the offspring of unauthorized immigrants , a @entity2 study released wednesday concluded			1
according to the study , an estimated 340,000 of the 4.3 million babies born in this country that year had parents who were in the @entity4 without legal documentation			1
the 14th amendment to the @entity13 stipulates that those children automatically become @entity4 citizens , but some members of @entity17 are pushing to change that provision			1
that effort -- rooted in the debate over illegal immigration , particularly of people from @entity23 -- has created some controversy			2
" this has got a lot of attention in the past weeks , " said @entity25 , the study 's author			2
" the idea was just to put a number on it			0
" according to the study , 79 percent of the 5.1 million children of unauthorized immigrants in the @entity4 were born in this country , making them @entity4 citizens			1
nearly one of four children born in the @entity4 in 2008 had parents who were immigrants , the @entity2 study found			1
of those , 16 percent of the parents were legal immigrants and 8 percent were in the @entity4 without proper documentation			1
many of those children are @entity45 , @entity25 said			0
more than three - fourths of all unauthorized immigrants in the @entity4 in march 2009 were @entity48 , the researcher said			1
and nearly one of every four children under age 18 in the nation was a @entity45			0
that trend is likely to continue , the study concludes			0
" overall , @entity45 who live in the @entity4 have higher rates of fertility than do whites , blacks or @entity60 , " the report states			2
" and among @entity45 , the foreign born have higher rates of fertility than the native born			0
" immigration reform has become a hot - button issue this political season			0
@entity68 passed a law in april that required all immigrants to carry documentation of legal status and other states are considering similar measure even though major parts of the @entity68 law were struck down last month in federal court			0
" the country is really emotionally torn over this , " @entity4 senator @entity78 , @entity80 - @entity79 , said recently on @entity0			2
the government estimates there are more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity4			1
proponents of stricter immigration enforcement and control point to the large number of @entity48 having babies in the @entity4 as reason to change the 14th amendment			1
the proponents say these children , which they often call " anchor babies , " qualify for welfare and other programs and make it harder to deport their parents " babies born to illegal alien mothers within @entity4 borders are called anchor babies because under the @entity110 , they act as an anchor that pulls the illegal alien mother and eventually a host of other relatives into permanent @entity4 residency , " says an organization called @entity102 , which has described itself as " a coalition of immigration crime fighters opposing illegal and undocumented immigration			1
" under the 1965 @entity110 , the child may sponsor other family members for entry into the @entity4 when he or she reaches the age of 21			2
the group notes that " the 14th amendment was ratified in 1868 to protect the rights of native - born @entity123 , whose rights were being denied as recently freed slaves			1
" the intent of the amendment " was clearly not to facilitate illegal aliens defying @entity4 law at taxpayer expense , " @entity102 says on its website			1
having a child become an automatic @entity4 citizen can provide immigrants with another reason to come to this nation illegally , some critics say			1
" i think we need to look at that in the future as to whether or not we want to change that because i think it 's an incentive to break the law , " said @entity78 , the @entity4 senator			2
@entity145 state rep. @entity144 , a @entity146 , pointed out another concern on @entity0 's " @entity148 " program tuesday night			0
some pregnant women from other countries are traveling to the @entity4 to give birth and then taking their babies back home to raise them as terrorists that would return to attack @entity4 , she said			2
information for that " sinister issue , " @entity144 said , is coming from from former @entity160 officials she declined to name			0
" this is something that is being talked about by various members of @entity17 , " she said			0
state rep. @entity164 , a @entity165 , disputed the claim , calling it " the myth of anchor babies			0
" " for that to rise to some sort of national security concern is really unsubstantiated , " @entity164 said			0
" the 9/11 bombers were all here legally			0
the @entity175 bomber was a naturalized citizen			0
he was not an anchor baby			0
" @entity164 also disputed the contention that having a baby in the @entity4 hinders the deportation process			2
" the law does not bear that out , " he said			0
" just because you have a child here does n't mean you ca n't be deported tomorrow			0
" despite all the heat , a majority of @entity123 seem to oppose changing the 14th amendment			1
a nationwide poll conducted in june by the @entity2 found that 56 percent of @entity123 are against changing the citizenship provision while 41 percent favor amending it			1
the @entity2 is a nonpartisan research organization that does not take positions on policy issues .			1

the study was conducted by the @entity2 , a nonpartisan research group
the results come amid a national debate over changing the 14th amendment
the 14th @entity198 grants automatic citizenship to anyone born in the @entity4
