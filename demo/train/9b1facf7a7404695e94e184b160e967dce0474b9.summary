-- an estimated 600,000 @entity1 took to the polls on wednesday as the country held its first election since a military coup in 2006			1
there are hopes the election will mark a genuine return to a democratic era for this @entity12 island nation , whose record of coups has seen it labeled a " @entity23 , " after the name of its military leader , and whose turbulent domestic politics sits sharply at odds with the idyllic image that draws hundreds of thousands of tourists each year			1
" it 's been highly anticipated			0
there 's the expectation that after eight years this will be the defining moment for re-democratization in @entity1 , " says @entity25 , a @entity1 academic who is a senior lecturer in @entity12 studies at the @entity27			1
but in a country that has experienced four coups d'etat in the past 27 years , not everyone is optimistic			1
" i 'd describe it as a return to a very fragile democracy dependent on the whims and fancies of essentially one or two individuals , " says @entity1 academic @entity36 , a professor of @entity12 and @entity38 history at @entity39			1
why does @entity1 have so many coups ? at the heart of the country 's political instability , said @entity25 , are ethnic tensions between the country 's indigenous majority , predominantly @entity53 , who are believed to have arrived on the islands 3,500 years ago , and @entity56			1
the latter group are mainly descendants of indentured laborers brought from @entity60 by @entity1 's former @entity62 colonial rulers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to work on the sugarcane plantations			1
in the 2007 census , indigenous @entity1 accounted for about 57 % of the population , @entity56 for about 38 %			1
these tensions were particularly exacerbated by the previous political system , in which ethnicity was politicized and politics was a zero - sum game , says @entity25			0
@entity1 's first coup in 1987 saw an elected , @entity60 - dominated coalition overthrown by indigenous @entity1 , leading to the implementation , and later withdrawal , of a constitution that guaranteed indigenous political supremacy			1
in 2000 , the country 's first ethnic @entity60 prime minister , his cabinet and several mps were held hostage for several weeks in a coup , led by businessman @entity84 , that began with deadly riots in the streets of @entity87 , the capital			2
by contrast , said @entity25 , during the 2006 military coup , led by then military commander @entity91 , an ethnic @entity1 , the military 's role shifted from acting in the name of indigenous nationalist interests to taking action against them			1
at the heart of the dispute triggering the 2006 coup was proposed legislation that would have granted pardons to plotters of the previous coup , and two land rights bills that @entity91 believed would have unfairly favored indigenous @entity1 over the @entity56 minority			1
" in the 2006 coup , the military itself had shifted from being an ethno - nationalist military into a more politically moderate institution , " says @entity25			1
why does the military play such a large role in @entity1 politics ? partly , because it plays a large role in @entity1 life , says @entity25			1
" even before colonialism , tribal leaders who were the dominant chiefs in @entity1 came to power as warriors			2
when the @entity62 came they transferred that warrior psychology into the new military psychology , " he says			0
" the notion of the warrior class has always been there			0
" over the years , the military has become deeply entwined into @entity1 society			1
" almost everyone has a relative in the military			0
it 's linked to the @entity1 sense of masculinity , it 's linked to the economy -- there are @entity1 soldiers doing peacekeeping around the world who send back remittances , " he says			2
will the elections be free and fair ? while polls indicate @entity91 's party is the most popular of the seven contesting the election , questions remain as to how far the strongman prime minister has shaped the process in his favor			1
" in terms of whether the ballot boxes are secure , my sense on that front is it will be fairly ok , " says @entity36 , a long - standing critic of the regime			0
" the problem is that you have to assess if it 's fair in the context in which it takes place			0
" @entity1 does not have a free media , he says , with the government controlling tv , radio and newspaper outlets			2
" he has media exposure which other parties do n't -- they 've complained but there 's no action			0
he has used the advantages of incumbency to the hilt			0
" @entity36 says there is a " sense of fait accomplit " around the election -- " that whatever happens , @entity91 will return , " either through the ballot box , or by insisting on staying if the results are not to his favor			0
another scenario , he says , is that the military could step in to safeguard the new constitution , implemented last year , if other parties look to make good on their stated desire to change it			0
how will the country 's ethnic divide be reflected in voting ? @entity91 's changes to political structures have gone some way to creating a more equitable situation between indigenous and @entity56 , says @entity36			0
he has introduced a new constitution , abolished the powerful @entity191 , a traditional group of indigenous @entity1 leaders who mostly inherited their positions , and done away with electoral boundaries that grouped people according to their ethnicity to the benefit of indigenous @entity1			2
he pushed steadily for equal rights , culminating in a 2013 constitution , helping him to consolidate his popularity among @entity56			0
" @entity91 says we have abolished racial voting , which is true , but how does that translate into race relations ? " says @entity36			0
" @entity206 - @entity1 will vote for @entity91 , partly out of fear that they 'll be at the mercy of @entity1 nationalists should they fail -- also because his policies are geared towards bread and butter issues , and ... many @entity56 live below the poverty line			2
" while there are many @entity56 who do n't support @entity91 -- and many indigenous @entity1 , particularly among the poor , who do -- many indigenous voters were aggrieved by the changes he had brought about in the name of equality			2
" many indigenous @entity1 feel hard done by -- their cultural institutions such as the @entity191 have been abolished with no consultation whatsoever , " @entity36 says			2
the restoration of democracy would also help hasten the international rehabilitation of a country that has been diplomatically isolated at the behest of regional powers @entity231 and @entity230			0
if the election is judged fair by the team of about 100 international observers monitoring the vote , the @entity233 group of nations has indicated @entity1 could be welcomed back into the fold as early as this month .			0
