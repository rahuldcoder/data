add the @entity5 - @entity4 superstar 's name to a long list of beloved celebrities killed in the crash of a charter aircraft			1
that list includes singer / actress @entity11 , golfer @entity12 and musicians @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			0
in 2008 , @entity18 of @entity19 and @entity17 were critically injured -- and four other passengers were killed -- when their charter jet crashed on takeoff in @entity23			1
overall , the industry is overwhelmingly safe			1
yet sunday 's crash in northern mexico that killed @entity27 and six others , including a pilot and co-pilot , has focused attention on charter safety			1
related : plane owner linked to troubled businessman one red flag , experts say , is the 43 - year - old plane 's age			1
" the @entity42 is a pretty reliable airplane , but this one was really old , " says @entity39 , an attorney and licensed pilot who specializes in plane crashes			1
" as a general rule , over 40 years old , and i think you need to be concerned			0
" however -- on its own -- age is not an indicator of an airplane 's safety , says @entity52			2
" this plane was 10 minutes in flight , so you would n't expect that to be a factor in this type of accident , " he said			2
in general , experts say travelers can reduce their risk of choosing a charter that 's poorly run -- or even illegal -- by asking a few smart questions			1
owner of plane in @entity1 crash under @entity71 investigation pilots make sure the charter is well established and employs its own pilots , experts say			1
@entity76 is president and owner of @entity78 , a 17 - year - old outfit based in @entity79 , @entity80 , that flies six aircraft			1
" our search process is very stringent , " he says			0
" we see dozens of candidates at least before we settle on a pilot , which is pretty common , for good quality operators			0
" the @entity54 does n't impose age limits for charter pilots , although pilots for airliners and other commercial carriers must retire at age 64			2
charter pilots must pass flight medical exams , which increase in frequency with age			2
@entity54 certificate in the @entity4 , ask to see the charter operator 's @entity100 135 air carrier certificate			1
it 's what legally defines an operator as a charter carrier			2
" it should be posted inside their building , " @entity39 says			0
brokers be aware that if you use a broker instead of booking directly from a charter operator , you 're putting your journey in the hands of a middleman			1
critics call it " jet roulette " because you 're essentially trusting the broker to hire a safe and legal charter plane			1
maintenance ask charter operators if their firm performs its own aircraft maintenance			2
find out if training for the charter company 's mechanics is approved by the aircraft manufacturers			2
safety audits many charters and brokers hire outside companies to oversee , rate and suggest improvements for their safety practices			2
insurance @entity39 says he has seen more than his share of illegal " bootleg " charter operations , and one way to easily smoke them out is to ask about their insurance liability			0
depending on the value of the plane , @entity76 says look for a range between $ 5 million and $ 300 million			0
" get a copy of the policy , " @entity39 says			0
" if they do n't have at least a $ 10 million policy and you 're chartering a jet -- run			0
" the @entity54 does require charter companies to carry insurance			0
but it does not require insurance for non-charter private planes			0
that makes it very tempting , @entity39 says , for private plane owners to rake in fat profits by pretending to be a legal charter operator			1
" they need to pass a law that says you have to have insurance on any airplane , just like they do cars , " he says			0
when contracting with a non- @entity4 charter operator , it gets more complicated			1
rules and regulations are different in every country , underscoring the importance of grilling the operator about maintenance , documentation and oversight			0
appearances can mean a lot			0
" sometimes all you need to do is look at a plane to know you do n't want to get on it , " @entity39 said			0
deadly charter accidents increased in the @entity4 last year , according to the @entity54 , up from six fatal accidents in 2010 to 16 in 2011 , when pilots logged more than 3 million hours in flight			1
deaths rose from 17 to 41			0
worldwide so far this year , out of more than 17,600 business jets -- which include small private and charter planes -- there have been 12 major accidents and 25 deaths , according to the @entity195			1
@entity0 's @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
