@entity0 -- one of the most dramatic developments from the trial of disgraced senior politician @entity4 is n't what was said in court , but that the arguments were revealed at all			1
the public received updates released on social media -- a first in a country where most court proceedings are held in secret and the outcome far from doubt			1
while official state media has given cursory coverage to the trial , @entity16 netizens fed an online frenzy of commentary about the case , which was the top trending topic thursday on @entity24 's @entity23 , a @entity16 @entity25 - like microblogging site			1
" the live coverage of @entity4 's case on @entity29 's @entity23 feeds is awesome and a huge progress for media coverage on trials ! " wrote @entity23 writer @entity26			2
followers of the @entity36 court 's @entity23 account jumped from less than 10,000 on wednesday to more than 330,000 by friday morning as the court fed updates of the bribery case against @entity4 , whose downfall last year was laced with tales of murder and corruption , creating the @entity45 's biggest political crisis in decades			1
" while it 's difficult to say whether @entity49 censored the material -- foreign journalists were not allowed inside to cover the trial , so it 's unclear how closely the official remarks hewed to what actually went down in the courtroom -- it is certainly @entity16 's first live - microblogged show trial , " noted @entity46 in @entity47			1
once heir apparent for a place at the top of @entity16 's political elite , @entity4 is on trial on charges of bribery , embezzlement and abuse of power			1
his wife , @entity67 , was convicted last year of murdering a @entity69 businessman in a case that began @entity4 's downfall			2
on thursday , @entity4 gave a spirited defense against the bribery charges -- which in itself surprised observers			1
according to posts by the court , @entity4 contested the claim that he had taken bribes from @entity80 , a businessman in the northeastern industrial city of @entity82 , where @entity4 used to be mayor			2
after watching a video in which @entity80 detailed how he sent @entity4 money , @entity4 remarked , " i saw an ugly performance by a person who sold his soul , " the court said			2
there were two surprising elements from the dispatches thursday from the court , according to @entity94 of the @entity95			0
the first was that @entity4 has dared to reject the allegations against him , and the poor performance of the prosecution which @entity94 described as " terrible			0
" he said any deal that had been done before the trial appears to be unraveling			0
" all of a sudden , in my view , @entity4 has decided not to co-operate , but not completely			0
because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems ; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most , " @entity94 said			0
while official state media offered little commentary on the proceedings , @entity16 netizens were n't afraid to wade in			1
" after reading the whole transcript of the trial , i realized that the prosecutors actually failed to offer direct proofs of @entity4 taking bribes			2
instead , they talked a bunch of issues that do n't really have much to do with the accusations , " wrote @entity120			0
@entity128 : " @entity4 thought high of himself , abusing the power for personal gains and fooled the public			0
but he did n't know that those who misuse the power which granted by people will be severely punished according to the discipline of the party and the law of the country			0
" still , many supporters on @entity23 applauded @entity4 's tenure as mayor of @entity139 , where he made his name as an anti-graft crusader			0
" you ( referring to @entity4 ) will always remain a great secretary in the eyes of @entity139 people ! " wrote @entity142			0
some heralded the live - blogged trial as turning a page for transparency in @entity16 ; others wondered whether @entity4 's defense itself was blessed by the state , as evidenced by the court 's release of his statements			1
but the court 's feverish stream of dispatches on thursday had slowed significantly on friday , adding to the belief that the outcome of the trial in @entity16 -- where only 0.1 % of cases return a not guilty verdict -- is of little doubt			1
" i never care about politics but i think it 's worth following right now because of @entity4 , but i can tell the result has been scripted , now is only a process to make people think that our country is fair and transparent , " wrote @entity167			2
@entity1 's @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report			0
