@entity0 -- the leading @entity7 negotiations on gun control legislation favor expanding background checks , but the effort would as of now fall short of the universal approach backed by president @entity3 and many @entity4 , @entity1 has learned			1
@entity11 background checks are currently required for commercial sales			1
the proposal being considered would expand them to gun shows and internet sales , but would not require checks for other private transactions , according to multiple sources from both parties who are familiar with the talks			1
sources familiar with the negotiations between @entity4 sen. @entity25 , @entity26 , and sen. @entity27 , @entity28 , tell @entity1 they exchanged proposals and ideas over the past few days and will soon get a better sense of where things stand			0
@entity27 joins talks on background checks @entity3 made another pitch for his gun control agenda on monday in @entity38 , not far from the town of @entity40 where a december school massacre jolted the nation and prompted current efforts in @entity0 for stricter gun laws			1
@entity3 , in @entity45 , angrily chided lawmakers , saying overwhelming support among the @entity49 people for measures like universal background checks should force action in @entity53			1
his message was crafted as much for lawmakers as it was for the families of @entity40 victims			0
they sat behind him on stage and were to travel to @entity0 with him on @entity60 to lobby members of @entity53			0
" @entity40 , we want you to know that we 're here with you , " @entity3 said			2
" we will not walk away from the promises we 've made			0
we are as determined as ever to do what must be done			0
" the @entity7 is expected to begin debate as early as this week over proposed firearms legislation , but @entity4 sources admit that the gun bill as currently written does not have the 60 votes needed to break any @entity73 filibuster			1
the powerful @entity74 is staunchly opposed to the measure			0
putting new pressure on negotiators , a spokesman for @entity77 said the @entity80 would support efforts by @entity73 colleagues to filibuster the @entity4 legislation			0
@entity4 leaders are hopeful that a deal on background checks that can win enough @entity73 support will emerge from the bipartisan negotiations			2
@entity3 scolds lawmakers on gun control @entity40 families to return to @entity0 with @entity3 , lobby @entity7 the working proposal between @entity25 and @entity27 would require background checks as well as make sellers keep a record of transactions			1
many law enforcement groups and gun control advocates view record keeping as critical to ensuring the check is enforceable and a weapon is traceable in case of a crime			2
senior democratic aides and sources from outside groups pushing for tighter gun restrictions acknowledge that this approach is less expansive than what they want			0
but they believe it would produce a better result than the other prominent negotiating track underway - requiring background checks in virtually all cases of private sales , but not mandating that records of those sales and checks be saved			2
recent polls show an overwhelming majority of @entity49 favor making a change to the background check system			0
@entity123 : ' i do n't understand ' threats to block gun bill debate poll : could background checks lead to gun confiscation ? deal on background checks still possible @entity1 's @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134 contributed to this report			1

bipartisan effort is weighing different gun control proposals ; debate possible this week
president @entity3 , many democrats favor expanding @entity11 background checks to all sales
but focus of leading @entity7 talks , at the moment , would expand checks , but not universally
new : @entity3 chides @entity53 for not passing gun legislation ; @entity40 families lobbying
