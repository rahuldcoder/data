@entity0 -- as the nation 's top stimulus cop , @entity2 tracks whether the $ 787 billion in taxpayer money is being properly spent			1
he 's not judging what it 's spent on , but whether the money gets to where it should be by the proper procedures			1
and so far , things are generally going well , @entity2 said in an exclusive interview to air tonight on @entity1 's " @entity13 "			1
it 's better than my worst nightmares , " said the 62 - year - old former football lineman , who now is chairman of the @entity18 , also known as the " rat " board , for its unofficial acronym			1
known for straight talk in his nearly four decades of government work , @entity2 is the head of a panel of inspectors general that keeps watch over government spending procedures for the stimulus plan			1
created almost a year ago , the @entity30 has come under criticism for both the kinds of projects funded and some well - publicized errors in the reporting process , including recipients of government funds who provided incorrect congressional districts or nonexistent zip codes			0
to @entity2 , a former @entity41 agent , such criticism misses the bigger issue , the unprecedented transparency in government spending under the stimulus program			1
all contracts are recorded on a web site set up by his panel , making information on where the stimulus money is going available to the public within weeks , he said			1
" this is a huge effort in transparency , " @entity2 said , adding that people " might not necessarily like " the projects being funded , but at least they can see where the money goes			1
such transparency is bound to encounter some human error , he said			0
" transparency in this case meant we were going to put that data up regardless of the errors that were in that data , " @entity2 said			2
he expressed surprise at the media focus on what he considered understandable mistakes			0
" every speech i gave , every comment i made , to any press person , i told them i expected to have data quality issues , and then when we had data quality issues , everybody acted surprised , " @entity2 said			2
" that surprised me a little bit , that people were shocked and awed by the fact that @entity82 citizens , when they filed the reports , made mistakes			2
it did n't surprise me at all			0
and that 's what transparency is all about			0
" then there are the more significant problems			0
according to the panel 's web site , it has received 1,006 complaints , which have prompted 106 investigations so far , with 25 cases moving toward possible prosecution			0
@entity2 said investigations so far have generally involved the wrong people receiving government money , such as someone previously deemed ineligible to do business with the government who opened a business under a different name			1
" i 'm pleased that i have n't seen as much fraud as i first might have imagined there to be , " @entity2 said			2
" i think quite frankly , if you 're going to go steal money , this would n't be the money you 'd want to steal , " he said			0
" too many eyes on it			0
" after 38 years in government work , @entity2 had been looking forward to retiring and playing golf when he got a call last year from vice president @entity118 about heading the recovery panel , he said			2
@entity118 and president @entity120 asked him to lead it , and @entity2 found it impossible to decline			2
at the same time , @entity2 assured @entity118 that " i would tell him not necessarily what he wanted to hear all the time , but what he needed to hear			2
and i would probably make him mad within the first six months			0
" asked how that went , @entity2 said , " i do n't know if mad is the right word , but ... the vice president and i have had some interesting discussions			0
" asked whether he thinks the stimulus program is working , @entity2 said his response was based on the process , rather than politics			1
" would things be worse if the recovery money was n't there ? i think they would be , " he said			0
for @entity2 , it all comes down to helping people see how their tax dollars are being spent			1
" transparency can be ugly			0
and like i said before , the @entity82 people might not like seeing some of their money being spent certain ways , " @entity2 said			1
" but they do have a right to see that			0
" @entity1 's @entity147 and @entity148 contributed to this report .			1
