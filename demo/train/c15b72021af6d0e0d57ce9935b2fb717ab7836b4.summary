-- @entity1 offers lots of things to do outdoors , which is good for the many television viewers who complain about the quality of programming then			0
@entity12 's " @entity11 " is one of the cable series providing a lift for summertime television viewing			1
it 's not that there are n't things to watch			0
on network television , there are plenty of repeats , reality shows and final episodes of series that have been canceled			1
but summertime viewing on network television can be a wasteland , especially for bloggers and critics whose gig it is to write and report on tv , said @entity31 , founder and editor of the @entity34 blog			1
" it 's borderline depressing , " @entity31 said			0
" between the onslaught of reality television and what i call filler tv -- shows that the networks may have under contract but they just feel the need to get out regardless of the quality -- it almost feels like [ the networks ] have given up			1
" @entity49 , for many the bible of the entertainment industry , reported on the first four weeks of summer			2
it said viewership of @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 was down 9 percent , according to @entity56			0
even more distressing for advertisers , viewership was down 15 percent in the 18 - 49 demographic and 18 percent in the coveted 18 - 34 demographic			0
the most quality she said she felt she has gotten out of network television this summer has been @entity52 burning off the final episodes of the canceled series " @entity65 , " " @entity66 " and " @entity67			0
" otherwise , @entity31 said , the great shows are happening on the cable networks			1
@entity71 blogs at @entity72 and counts among some of his favorite summer shows @entity77 's " @entity76 , " " @entity78 " on @entity79 and @entity12 's " @entity11			1
" " @entity11 " and other shows such as " @entity83 " are luring viewers who want original quality programs			0
fans are even showing up in big numbers for cable reality shows such as " @entity87 " ( currently on a break ) , and the " @entity90 " franchise			1
@entity91 , editor of the tv rating and analysis site @entity94 , said the shift to cable has been a long time coming			1
" it 's the continuation of a trend that 's been going on since the early ' 80s , " @entity91 told @entity97			0
" viewers continue making the 30 - year shift from watching broadcast to watching cable			2
" @entity104 , a tv critic for the @entity105 , said the apparent ceding of summer to cable by broadcast networks is rooted in tradition and the history of how television started			1
" the car manufacturers came out with their new models in september , and the tv people said , ' we will give you new shows to advertise your cars on , ' " storm			2
" that was part of it and that started in the 1950s			0
" storm said there is also a type of " circadian rhythm " to television in that viewers are more inclined to tune in when the days are shorter and colder			0
broadcast networks once were able to afford 39 episodes a year , he said			2
now economics often dictate a 22 - episode season			0
storm said networks now trot out cheaper - to - produce reality shows -- something @entity54 hit the jackpot with several years ago after the runaway success of the summer - debuted " @entity139			1
" " the networks just could n't afford to make shows all summer long , " said @entity104 , who will soon join his colleagues for one of their summer highlights -- the @entity146 's summer tour in @entity147 , @entity148			1
" now they 've found the answer , " @entity104 said			0
" they make all of these ridiculous @entity157 game shows -- crash yourself into the red balls , ' @entity152 ' show -- and several shows that come on and vanish before most tv critics and the general public even know they are there			1
" @entity161 , senior editor at @entity162 , said he has been doing what a lot of viewers do during summertime -- checking out television shows on dvd that he had n't watched during the fall season			2
" i think that putting television shows on dvd has changed the way a lot of people are watching , " he said			0
" during the summer , you feel like you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel			1
" @entity161 said it 's a chance to check out critically acclaimed shows that viewers either did n't have the time for or the inclination to watch			0
broadcast networks really have n't figured out what their strategy should be for summer programming , said @entity185 , the writer / editor of @entity187			1
" years ago , you had @entity55 launching scripted shows early in the summer and you had shows like ' @entity190 ' , " @entity185 said			2
" you used to have ' @entity191 ' during the summer as well , which was huge for @entity55			0
but [ networks ] really have n't gotten a grasp on their summer programming , so they are offering really random shows that nobody is really particularly interested in			1
" @entity185 said some of the offerings have been a mixed bag , such as " @entity200 , " which did n't exactly catch fire , and " @entity202 , " which he believes was n't as popular with viewers as @entity53 had hoped			0
@entity204 said that even the publicity push around some of the shows such as " @entity200 " and " @entity208 , " which broadcast networks have premiered during the summer , has not at all rivaled the fall season			1
" the promotion around them , i feel like the lack of enthusiasm with how the networks have communicated with bloggers feels very different , " she said			2
" whether it 's true or not , from my standpoint it feels like the networks are not very enthusiastic about the shows			2

summer seen as wasteland on broadcast tv for some critics and bloggers
networks often run repeats and launch reality shows during summertime
cable *stations* offer *destination* viewing for new , *hot* shows
@entity204 says " you are really scraping the bottom of the barrel " for shows
