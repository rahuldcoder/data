-- @entity1 has won the @entity3 primary			1
that much was clear as soon as the polls closed tuesday night			0
it took a little while longer to sort out exactly where the other candidates finished behind him , but that barely matters			0
regardless of the other candidates ' performances in @entity3 or even what happens in the @entity14 primary next week , @entity1 is extremely likely to be the @entity16 nominee			1
how can we know this so early , after only one primary election and the @entity21 caucus ? the dominant political science explanation of the presidential nominating process is contained in the book , " @entity25 " by @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29			0
they point out that candidates need support from their party 's politicians and activists across the country			1
from 1980 to the present , no candidate who significantly trailed in party endorsements has won the nomination			1
a few candidates have been nominated in years when no candidate took an early endorsement lead			1
these include @entity44 in 1988 and @entity45 in 2008			0
but no candidate has succeeded when significantly trailing by that measure			0
there are reasons to believe that this pattern is not a coincidence			0
your party 's politicians and activists can help you organize and raise money as you hopscotch to primaries and caucuses across the country			2
on top of this is the effect of national media figures on tv , radio and the internet closing ranks around the candidate most leaders in their party support			2
we got an excellent example of this in december when @entity73 opened up a fairly large lead in @entity21 and national polls			0
@entity1 's supporters used his fundraising advantage to pummel ( through a sympathetic @entity78 ) @entity79 with negative ads. on top of this , @entity16 pundits almost universally condemned @entity79			1
as @entity83 of @entity84 noticed , on december 14 , just about all columnists on the @entity87 op - ed page , regardless of their ideologies , criticized @entity79			0
on his morning show on @entity90 , former @entity16 congressman @entity91 , who served with @entity79 in the 1990s , called him a " bad person " who " will destroy our party			2
" this would continue if someone like @entity79 had initial success in the primaries and caucuses			0
as chronicled by @entity100 , @entity1 now has a big lead in @entity16 endorsements , giving him a huge advantage moving forward			1
through the end of november , @entity1 had 55 % of all @entity16 endorsements and his share has only increased in december and after his slim victory over @entity108 in @entity21			1
the only other person with a non-trivial number of endorsements is @entity113 gov. @entity112			2
consequently , @entity112 remains the only candidate who could somewhat plausibly challenge @entity1 in a drawn out fight for the nomination			1
how did this happen ? how did a candidate who relatively recently supported abortion and gay rights , and who as governor passed a health reform bill remarkably similar to the president 's , manage to lock up the @entity16 establishment 's support ? it was n't inevitable			1
the most plausible alternatives were former @entity130 gov. @entity129 and @entity112			2
@entity129 likely miscalculated by dropping out after weak performances in debates and in the @entity21 straw poll			0
@entity129 's campaign was low on cash			0
but many @entity16 endorsers were late in deciding to go with @entity1			1
if @entity129 had laid off campaign staff but stayed in the race , he might have benefited from a late surge in endorsements and in the polls			0
( @entity129 's mediocre debating performances would have evoked @entity144 in comparison to @entity112			2
) which brings us to the second candidate who could have won support from @entity16 elites : @entity112			1
right after he announced , it appeared that he might be able to match or even surpass @entity1 in establishment backing			2
but he has been hurt by his extremely weak campaign skills , including disastrous performances in debates and on the stump			0
in @entity16 eyes , he may be a reliable conservative , but he appears to be someone incapable of running a competent campaign against @entity45			0
still , @entity112 remains the only candidate besides @entity1 with nontrivial support from @entity16 elites			1
if he could somehow manage to run a respectable campaign and win a substantial number of votes in @entity14 , he would be @entity1 's only halfway plausible threat			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			0

@entity169 : it 's a good bet that @entity1 will win the @entity16 nomination
he says we can make that judgment based on his support among party *insiders*
candidates with the endorsement of party elites have *typically* won the nomination
@entity169 : the only candidate who even *approaches* @entity1 's party endorsements is @entity112
