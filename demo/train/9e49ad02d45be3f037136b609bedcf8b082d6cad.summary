-- having conquered the desktops , music libraries and phones of millions , @entity1 reportedly wants to adorn one more spot in the life of the gadget - obsessed -- their wrists			1
the company is developing a smart watch that would run on the same @entity13 operating system that powers iphones , @entity15 and some @entity16 , according to a report in the @entity18			1
the watches would include a curved glass screen , according to the @entity18 report , citing " people familiar with the company 's explorations			1
" @entity1 did not immediately respond to a request for comment monday			1
last year , @entity27 , which makes the @entity28 used for @entity15 and @entity29 , unveiled a thinner , more touch - sensitive version of their product that could make it easier to produce a watch with curves			0
and , yes , assuming it includes chat - feature @entity36 , @entity39 fans could actually live out those decades - old dreams of having a video - enabled two - @entity41			0
what other features might such a watch have ? observers have speculated about monitoring of the wearer 's vital signs or turn - by - turn directions , spoken by @entity50 , @entity1 's " voice assistant			1
" of course , such reports are no sure thing			0
over the years , @entity1 has reportedly poked around into products ranging from cars to cameras without any commercially available product ever coming from it			2
an @entity58 has been in the rumor stages for years now , and while many observers still expect one to surface eventually , there have been no signs yet			0
if the plans are indeed sincere , @entity1 may be taking a cue from the interest the market already has shown in such a product			1
@entity69 , a watch that uses bluetooth technology to link up with the user 's smartphone , racked up a record $ 10.2 million on @entity74 last year			2
@entity75 and @entity76 , two styles of a wrist - strap gadget that turns an @entity79 into a smart watch , raked in another $ 942,000			0
at least one analyst told the @entity18 that the move makes sense , although it might be a while before an " @entity85 " hits the shelves			2
" over the long term , wearable computing is inevitable for @entity1 ; devices are diversifying , and the human body is a rich canvas for the computer , " said @entity86 , a @entity87 analyst who specializes in mobile technology			0
" but i 'm not sure how close we are to a new piece of @entity1 hardware that is worn on the body			0
