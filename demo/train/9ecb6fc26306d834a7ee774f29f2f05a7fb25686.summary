@entity0 -- a judge rejected @entity4 's request that she dismiss the @entity6 wrongful death lawsuit , but two executives were dropped as individual defendants on monday , a ruling that had each side claiming a measure of victory			1
the trial , which is in its fifth month in a @entity0 courtroom , is expected to conclude with closing arguments as soon as next week			2
but before @entity4 lawyers rest their defense case on september 16 , they may call @entity6 's mother back to the witness stand , attorney @entity16 said			1
a decision will be made on the need for more testimony from @entity25 after the judge rules on several issues regarding possible damages on wednesday , @entity16 said			0
the @entity30 matriarch delivered two days of dramatic testimony in july , which included a heated cross examination by @entity16			0
" she was trying to answer the questions the best she could , " @entity6 lawyer @entity34 said after she left the stand			0
" i think maybe she lost her temper a little bit and she tried to restrain herself in a very @entity41 - like way			0
" @entity6 's 83 - year - old mother and three children accuse @entity4 of negligently hiring , retaining or supervising dr. @entity44 , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon 's death			1
the company 's executives missed several warning signs that @entity6 's health was deteriorating under @entity44 's care , they contend			1
@entity4 argues that @entity6 , not its executives , chose and controlled @entity44			2
judge : jurors will decide the case @entity59 judge @entity58 ruled on monday that the case against @entity4 will be sent to the jury			0
the company had filed a " nonsuit motion " that argued the @entity64 failed to present enough evidence to warrant jury deliberations			0
" substantial evidence has been presented at trial from which a jury can reasonably infer that defendants ( @entity4 ) knew or should have known that dr. @entity44 presented an undue risk of harm to decedent ( @entity6 ) , " she said in her ruling			1
@entity4 lawyers contend that their executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous -- and ultimately fatal -- infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol the doctor was using to treat the singer 's insomnia			2
the coroner ruled @entity6 died of a propofol overdose on june 25 , 2009 -- just days away from the premiere of his " this it it " tour in @entity89			0
the judge also ruled that the @entity64 " presented substantial evidence " that @entity4 's " conduct was a substantial factor in causing " @entity6 's death			1
pain was real , doctor testifies " a jury may logically infer from the evidence that ( @entity6 ) died because dr. @entity44 , who was adversely affected by a conflict of interest created by his contractual arrangement with @entity4 , treated a deteriorating insomniac who was not ready to perform , causing dr. @entity44 to make bad medical decisions that caused ( @entity6 's ) death , " the judge wrote			1
the @entity6 case contends @entity4 created a medical conflict of interest by agreeing to pay the debt - ridden @entity44 $ 150,000 a month to serve as @entity6 's personal physician			1
@entity44 's agreement said he could lose his job if the tour was postponed or canceled , leading him to make unsafe medical decisions , they argue			0
@entity44 told investigators he treated @entity6 with propofol most nights for the last two months of his life			0
the @entity64 contend the treatments began once @entity4 co-ceo @entity120 agreed in a phone call to @entity44 's demands for $ 150,000 a month			1
" the timing of when dr. @entity44 ordered propofol is a matter of factual dispute ( as to whether that means dr. @entity44 used it prior to @entity4 's retention of him ) , " the judge wrote			2
" the court finds that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that dr. @entity44 's treatment of decedent was connected to @entity44 's employment by @entity4			2
therefore defendants ' motion for nonsuit is denied			0
" @entity4 execs dropped from suit @entity4 ceo @entity4 and co-ceo @entity120 were dismissed as individual defendants in the case			1
the two executives in charge of producing and promoting @entity6 's comeback concerts " did not assume personal liability " when dealing with the hiring of @entity44 , @entity58 wrote			2
" rather , they acted solely as an agent of @entity4			0
" a @entity6 lawyer downplayed the significance of the dismissal of the two men as defendants , saying the plaintiffs previously offered to drop them from the case but @entity4 lawyers refused			1
closing arguments could come as soon as september 19 , after @entity6 lawyers offer several witnesses next week in rebuttal to the @entity4 defense			1
testimony was suspended for this week because a female juror traveled out of the state on an emergency trip to visit a seriously ill close relative , @entity58 said monday .			0

@entity4 lawyers say they may call @entity6 's mother back to the witness stand
judge : enough evidence to " reasonably infer " @entity4 should have known @entity44 was a risk
@entity4 execs @entity4 and @entity120 dismissed as individual defendants
testimony *resumes* september 16 with closing arguments soon after
