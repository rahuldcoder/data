-- it may have made the biggest splash , with the usual tech - world buzz that arises around any @entity5 product announcement			1
but the @entity6 was n't the only new tablet rolled out on tuesday			1
both @entity8 and @entity9 unveiled entries they hope will compete with @entity5 , @entity12 's @entity11 , @entity15 's @entity14 tablets and a slew of other tabs running @entity15 's @entity19 operating system			1
@entity9 's first full - size tablet , the @entity21 , has a 10 - inch display screen and runs a version of the the @entity25 operating system			2
it sells for $ 499 , with @entity27 and a 6.7 - megapixel back - facing camera			0
it was introduced tuesday , the same day @entity8 rolled out its next generation of tablet - laptop hybrids for sale			1
the @entity35 starts at $ 449 for a @entity37 model			0
it 's thinner and more powerful than its predecessor and drops the confusing " rt " from the end of its name			0
the souped - up @entity46 2 starts at $ 899 and runs all the way up to a whopping @entity48 ( for $ 1,799 ) that puts that model closer to the laptop end of the spectrum			0
that 's just two more names jumping into the tablet fray as the holiday shopping season approaches			2
on tuesday , @entity5 ceo @entity55 said that @entity56 account for 81 % of all the world 's tablet usage , suggesting sales and customer satisfaction combine to make it the hands - down leader in the field			1
that may well be true			0
it 's certainly hard to argue with the 170 million sales figure @entity55 announced for all @entity56 since they were introduced in 2010			0
but just two years ago , that usage number would have been closer to 100 % , meaning the rest of the field has started chipping away at @entity5 's lead			1
@entity73 's @entity72 , in 10 - and - 7 - inch varieties , have made a relatively strong run and @entity15 's @entity14 has gotten almost unanimously positive reviews , with some critics declaring it superior to @entity5 's smaller @entity79			2
all of which is to say that , when holiday shoppers are looking to shell out cash for a tablet this year , they 'll have more options than ever			0
in the gallery above , we take a closer look at some of the top tablets on the market , as well as some of their newest competitors .			2
