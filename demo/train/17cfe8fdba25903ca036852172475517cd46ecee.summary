-- barely two days ago , their paths crossed in the worst possible circumstances -- a man armed with an assault rifle had entered @entity7 's school , and she called police			2
on thursday , @entity10 and @entity11 , the 911 dispatcher on the other end of that line , were together again , sharing an emotional hug and tears before sitting down to recount the episode with @entity0 's @entity17			1
" we made it ! " @entity10 joyfully declared , with @entity11 responding , " we did			1
" the atmosphere for the reunion was starkly different than their original encounter as voices on opposite ends of a telephone line			0
that happened at 12:51 p.m. tuesday when , according to @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity32 spokeswoman @entity31 , authorities got their first call about a shooting at the @entity35 in @entity36 , just outside @entity37			1
shortly before that , the gunman had slipped into the school and gone into its main office , where he shot one round into the ground			1
" i knew then that it was for real , " recalled @entity10 , who was in there with him			1
" and that i could lose my life			0
" it was then that @entity10 , bookkeeper in that school 's front office , dialed 911			1
but she was n't the only person that could be heard a few miles away at police dispatch -- at times , there was the voice of the suspect , later identified as @entity60 , in the background			1
the gunman used @entity10 as a conduit to relay information to police , which in this case meant @entity11 , who took @entity10 's call at the dispatch center			1
in their voices , both women sounded calm throughout the call -- even as gunshots were ringing out around @entity10 , and later when the suspect reached into a bag to reload his @entity76 - type assault rifle			1
but inside , they now admit , they were terrified			0
@entity11 recalled thursday how her hands were shaking , though she knew that she could n't reveal her fears in her voice			1
and @entity10 said she was trying to incorporate the lessons she 'd learned in church to stay strong for herself , the 800 - plus elementary school students in the classrooms behind her -- and for the gunman whom she came to feel for			1
" i was actually praying on the inside , " she recalled			0
" i was terrified , but i just started praying			0
" @entity7 hailed a hero early in the call , @entity10 was blunt in what amounted to a vital assessment of the situation : " he does n't want the kids			1
so back off , " she told @entity11			1
in the next breath , @entity10 asked him , " and what else sir ? " the suspect darted from the office to outside a few times , becoming particularly " agitated " in @entity10 's words when police fired back with bullets " coming from everywhere			1
" " and i said to him , come back in here right now , " said the school bookkeeper , who admitted she had to go " to the bathroom so bad " the entire ordeal			0
" ... do n't worry about it , stay with me , we 're both going to be safe , " she told the man			0
the scariest moment , @entity10 said , came when -- after having fired shots , several times , at police positioned outside -- the suspect went into his bag , reloaded his gun and packed his pants and jacket pockets with yet more bullets			1
" i knew when he made the last call that he was going to go , " she recalled on @entity0			2
" because he had loaded up to go			0
" but the tone changed over the next few frenetic minutes , much like what was happening at the school			0
in the beginning , the gunman appeared " like he did n't care , " giving the impression that he 'd come " in purposely knowing that he was going to die and take lives with him , " said @entity10			1
but his language , and actions , softened -- and so did @entity10 's feelings for him			2
" i really began to feel sorry for him , " she told @entity17 , adding that the suspect told her he was off his medication and considering suicide			0
" i knew that where he was at mentally was not a good place			0
but i knew that he was there , for whatever particular reason , in life			0
" the man with the rifle eventually let it be known , via @entity150 , that he was no longer threatening to shoot any police officers who approached ; by then , he was communicating with them about where he should put his gun , where he should get down on the ground in surrender , and how police would come and get him			0
as all of this unfolded , the dispatcher talking to @entity150 largely remained silent -- except a few brief acknowledgments about what she 'd heard and the constant clatter of her keyboard			2
in her heart and behind the scenes , though , @entity11 was sweating it out			2
thankfully , she had a " true hero " partner in @entity150 who , with her clear descriptions and calm demeanor , made it so the call - taker and thus police could very easily " visualize what she was seeing and what she was going through			0
" even to the end , emotions ran high			0
the suspect started getting " agitated " after he 'd decided to surrender , standing back up and taking a drink of water because police had yet to come and get him			2
recognizing what was happening , @entity11 said she put her phone on mute			2
" i 'm hollering across the ( dispatch ) room : ' hey , he 's getting agitated , we need to move			0
' " they did get inside the @entity36 school in a flurry soon thereafter , surrounding and detaining @entity60			0
that was then , finally , both @entity10 and @entity11 could breathe a sigh of relief			1
" you did great , " @entity11 said to @entity150 long minutes after that first call came in			2
" @entity60 , meanwhile , was swiftly taken away by law enforcement officers and now sits in a @entity30 jail awaiting charges that likely will include aggravated assault on a police officer , making terroristic threats and false imprisonment , according to authorities			2
@entity10 would like to visit him , calling him a " hurting soul " who she 'd like to help			1
" we all go through something , " she said , with her 911 call reflecting on her challenges raising a disabled child and suicidal thoughts after the end of her marriage after more than two decades			0
" and i believe that @entity220 gives us a purpose in life			0
" and @entity10 believes she was meant to be at @entity224 on tuesday , even though she 'd originally been scheduled to be off			1
she thinks she was meant to be up front to first encounter the gunman -- in that location at that time because she 'd been delayed from going back to her desk			2
she said it was all part of @entity220 's plan -- for her , for the suspect and for @entity224 's students			0
but that does n't mean @entity10 knew she had it in her , to face down a gunman and potential death so calmly , and to live to tell about it			1
" no , no. if somebody would have told me that i was going to be doing that that day , i would n't have believed it , " she told @entity0			1
" @entity220 has a way of showing you what 's really in you			0
