-- if @entity4 starlet @entity3 's shaven head and tearful mea culpa looked more like a disgraced samurai trying to retrieve his honor , then it owes much to @entity4 pop phenomenon " @entity10 's " military structure			1
complete with four main divisions of girl performers , the j - pop sensation have their own theater training camps , a sub-corps of as many as 14 sister groups , a rigid order of succession and a strict code of conduct			1
the bubblegum empire even has foreign territorial ambitions , with a base set to be established in @entity24 and sister groups now located in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			2
but on friday , @entity3 's tearful admission that she had broken the group 's " no romance " bushido revealed serious cracks in the @entity34 of j - pop 's standing army			1
shaving her head -- considered a ritual act of contrition in @entity4 -- @entity3 described her actions as " thoughtless and immature " in a four - minute video posted on @entity42 that was viewed more than 3 million times			1
the @entity4 weekly tabloid @entity44 had earlier reported that she spent a night at the flat of @entity46 , a member of the boy band , " generations			1
" " if it is possible , i wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band , " she said			0
" everything i did is entirely my fault			0
" i do n't believe just doing this means i can be forgiven for what i did , but the first thing i thought was that i do n't want to quit @entity10 , " she said before concluding the admission with a deep bow			1
the apology did little to assuage management , who withdrew @entity3 's commission , demoting her to " trainee status , " according to the band 's blog			2
meanwhile , the scandal has been avidly taken up by @entity4 's voracious tabloid media			1
it 's an endless source of fodder to fill magazines and now they have one that went all @entity77 , " said an industry source who asked not to be identified			0
@entity10 comprises four teams of around 20 members who rotate to play at the @entity10 theater in @entity82 's @entity81 , where the group takes its name			1
the concept allows one team to perform while the others tour , promote or record			0
with 88 members in the band , it is registered in the @entity92 as the largest band in the world			0
the brainchild of the group 's @entity97 , the bands have been a goldmine , grossing 16.28 billion yen ( $ 212 million ) in 2011 in cd and dvd sales alone , according to compiler @entity102			1
with @entity107 style auditions that continually renew the ranks of the teams , the girls aged from14 to 20 either " graduate " to become solo artists within @entity97 's swelling stable of performers , or they simply take early retirement			1
" misbehavior , " as it 's deemed in the group , merits expulsion or in the case of @entity3 , demotion			2
the groups are now so popular that tickets for the daily performances are allocated on a lottery system			2
@entity97 says he wanted to create a concept where the audience could meet their idols , and the groups regularly hold " handshake events " where the audience gets to " high - five " the performers on the way into the show			1
while @entity10 may seemed to be pitched at @entity4 teens , the audience is usually made up of @entity4 salarymen -- a phenomenon not lost on @entity97 who has been criticized for sexualizing young women			1
video clips show performers in skimpy miniskirts , passing food from mouth to mouth or taking baths together			0
" it 's the same as art versus obscenity , " @entity97 told @entity0			1
" it 's up to personal judgment on how we perceive it			0
" but with song lyrics that run : " i want to take off my school uniform , i want to misbehave , you can do whatever you like , i want to experience adult pleasure , " @entity97 has been accused of feeding the teen schoolgirl fetish			2
" they 're not reading their diaries , " said @entity97 , defending the performers			2
" it 's about acting			0
" for example , there 's a song called @entity166			0
this song is asking why junior high school kids kill themselves ... unless i take up the issues these girls are facing as a songwriter the issues wo n't get addressed			2
" there are kids out there who want to take off their school uniforms and misbehave , and i 'm depicting realities in their lives in which they wonder whether it 's okay to think that way			0
" i 'm not forcing them			0
i 'm picturing their private lives partly based on my imagination or newspaper articles or tv news reports			0
i watch what their generation is doing -- the issues of bullying , suicide , or traps with sugar daddies			0
" @entity0 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0
