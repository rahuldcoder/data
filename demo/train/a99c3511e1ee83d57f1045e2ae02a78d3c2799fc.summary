-- everything may be bigger in @entity2 , but it 's not all cowboy boots and big hair in @entity5			1
streets of @entity8 fashion blogger @entity7 wo n't be stopping to snap a photo of stereotypical style any time soon			1
" your big hair ? not getting on here ! " @entity7 said , laughing			2
" it 's the football season look : cowboy boots , jean shorts			1
but the great thing about @entity5 , since we have the stereotype in place already , is that you can get away with wearing cowboy boots			1
" instead , the downtown @entity5 scene is all about dressing to the nines in designer duds			1
@entity7 uses her blog to celebrate the flashy and classy women who treat the sidewalks as their stage			1
even in the extreme summer swelter , @entity28 wo n't be caught without their heels and decadent ensembles			0
" it 's like a @entity34 preppy twist , depending on the neighborhood , " @entity7 said			1
" everyone is wearing some sort of a classic piece			0
it 's a @entity41 / @entity40 mix. " below , @entity7 explains the @entity5 look			1
@entity0 : what 's the style vibe in @entity5 ? @entity7 : people 's perception of @entity5 is really funny when they 've never been here			1
and when they come here , i guess they do n't expect women to shop -- like we 're all walking around in cowboy boots			1
@entity41 was started here , so that 's the vibe			1
the women here love to dress up			2
it 's very classy , mixed with flashy -- a timeless look with a statement piece , like your shoes or a bag			2
women here really appreciate that one designer piece			2
a lot of people in @entity5 are n't from the area , so it 's a lot of bringing things in and mixing with what we already have			2
colorful layers of style on @entity75 's streets @entity0 : in addition to @entity41 , what other stores are popular for @entity78 ? @entity7 : forty @entity79 brings in a lot of designers that you ca n't find anywhere			1
our vintage stores are really good : @entity87 's , @entity86 , @entity88			0
we are a one - stop shopping type of people -- so @entity91 is where most @entity92 shop ( they have everything , including our very first @entity95 , opening in august )			0
@entity0 : the temperatures are spiking in @entity5			2
how has that affected the street style ? @entity7 : the funny thing is , it 's 104 degrees and women still put in the effort to look good			1
to me , it 's kind of a celebration of style in this weather			2
the vibe is always going to be the same , and it 's a polished look			0
here 's the thing about @entity5 : everyone is getting in their cars and walking into air - conditioned buildings , so it 's really hard to do a street style blog here			1
it 's not like @entity75 or @entity119 , with tons of people passing you by			0
you have to wait around and see what you find			0
get smart : @entity125 street style @entity0 : how do you approach people to take their picture ? @entity7 : in @entity2 , we like to talk a lot , so everyone i stop has a story about what they 're wearing			1
every piece is like a drawn - out conversation			0
a lot of street style blogs are just about the photography			1
for me , it 's the entire experience -- having that moment with someone and paying them a compliment , which is maybe a @entity34 way of doing things			0
@entity5 women , because they dress up , want to be seen			1
when you walk up to them , and they got dressed for a reason today , they want somebody to say , " you look good			0
" imagine going your whole day and you 're like , " i look so fabulous and not one person has told me i look good			0
" then , imagine the day when somebody wants to take your picture			0
i think of it as " this is your moment , make it yours			0
" that 's how it is in @entity2			0
fashion from @entity163 to @entity164 @entity0 : what made you want to begin street style blogging ? @entity7 : it was always about the person , celebrating women who take the time to dress up and look good			1
i approach the people that i want to ask , " where did you get that ? " it 's me communicating with them , asking what they do , where they 're from and then talking about the style in itself			2
i like the stories behind everything			0
it 's my favorite part , like a treasure hunt			0
there are a lot of people that i think look great and i do n't take their picture			0
so it 's not always about that , but an attitude you get from them			0
it 's walking down the street and whatever makes me go " whoa			2
" first , it 's " what are you wearing ? " and then , " who are you , what 's the rest of the story ? " it 's not all country in @entity208			0

@entity7 's street style blog shines the *spotlight* on @entity5 ' flashy fashion
rather than cowboy boots , @entity5 women dress in designer duds for every *occasion*
@entity41 and @entity219 contribute to the designer scene in @entity5
