@entity0 -- both sides agree that forced spending cuts set to take effect next week will harm the economy and national security			1
both sides have plans for averting the worst impacts			0
so why are there no formal negotiations taking place with @entity13 on break this week as leaders from both parties accuse each other of intransigence ? once again , the answer is the @entity0 blame game			0
the same pattern of politically inspired brinksmanship that dominated president @entity24 's first term is continuing in the early days of his second			2
now , the collective weight of @entity24 's re-election in november and the subsequent fiscal cliff deal in which @entity29 conceded on tax increases makes compromise seem distant , if not impossible , in the short term			2
the central issue is the same one that framed last year 's presidential campaign			0
@entity29 want to shrink the size of government and the spending needed to run it , while @entity39 want to strengthen the safety net of federal programs that help the poor , the elderly , the disabled and other vulnerable communities			0
@entity24 and leaders of both parties warn the pending $ 85 billion in spending cuts set to kick in on march 1 bode ill for the nation , but the rhetoric so far has focused on blaming the other side			1
in an interview on thursday with the radio program " @entity53 , " @entity24 said @entity29 opposition to any further tax hikes or ending loopholes to raise more tax revenue was " the thing that binds their party together at this point			1
" " unfortunately , i think @entity29 have been so dug - in on this notion of never raising taxes that it becomes difficult for them to see an obvious answer right in front of them , " the president said			2
" we continue to reach out to the @entity29 and say , ' this is not gon na be good for the economy , it 's not gon na be good for ordinary people ' but i do n't know if they are going to move and that 's what we are going to have to try to keep pushing over the next seven , eight days , " @entity24 said			2
in an opinion piece published wednesday in the @entity79 , house speaker @entity77 labeled the spending cuts " ugly and dangerous , " saying they would diminish resources for the military , law enforcement , border security , aviation safety and other programs			1
however , the de facto @entity29 leader on the issue argued that his party 's agreement to raise tax rates on top income earners in january ended the discussion on further tax or revenue increases now			0
instead , @entity77 said he wanted other cuts to replace the across - the - board approach of sequestration , accusing @entity24 and @entity39 of ignoring what he called the nation 's spending problem			1
" the president got his higher taxes " with no spending cuts in the january deal , he wrote in the op - ed , adding that " no one should be talking about raising taxes " with examples of rampant government spending such as " paying people to play video games , giving folks free cell phones and buying $ 47,000 cigarette smoking machines			1
" voters in november returned @entity24 to office and gave @entity39 a stronger @entity121 majority while reducing the @entity29 majority in the @entity123 , leading to the january agreement on the fiscal cliff by the outgoing @entity13 in its final hours			2
that deal raised tax rates on families earning more than $ 450,000 and individuals earning above $ 400,000 while maintaining lower rates for everyone else			0
it also put off until march 1 the mandated spending cuts from a 2011 agreement that increased how much money the @entity135 could borrow to meet financial obligations			2
known in @entity0 jargon as sequestration , the forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies -- but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits -- were intended to motivate @entity13 to come up with a comprehensive deficit - reduction plan sought by both sides			1
@entity24 more emotional on spending cuts however , such an agreement proved impossible in the hyper - political climate of an election year , and the government - wide cuts opposed by both sides now are set to take effect			1
that would mean $ 85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013 , which ends september 30 , as part of a 10 - year total of about $ 1 trillion			0
@entity24 and @entity39 are offering the same approach to the issue as a central theme of the election , calling for the wealthy to pay more as part of a package of spending cuts and increased revenue to replace the forced cuts of sequestration			1
ratcheting up pressure on @entity29 with @entity13 in recess for presidents day week , @entity123 spokesman @entity170 announced thursday that @entity24 had phoned @entity77 and @entity121 minority leader @entity174			1
he provided no details beyond describing the calls as " good conversations			0
" both @entity77 and @entity178 have complained that @entity24 refuses to address needed spending cuts and entitlement reforms to bring about substantive deficit reduction , and the timing of the phone calls appeared in response to questions about a lack of formal talks involving the president			1
a $ 110 billion proposal by @entity39 , which is similar to a plan by @entity191 , would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires , stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in @entity199 in 2014			1
" you may not like what we 've proposed but at least let us have a vote in the @entity205 , " rep. @entity200 , @entity201 , said thursday in criticizing congressional @entity29			0
" come back here , call the @entity13 into session in the next eight days and let 's have a vote			0
if you want to vote no and say you prefer the consequences of the sequester to the alternative ... that 's your right			0
" on tuesday , @entity24 held a campaign - style event at the @entity123 to call for balancing the impact of deficit reduction so that the middle class and vulnerable citizens such as the elderly do n't get hit too hard			0
speaking in near apocalyptic terms , the president warned of criminals going free , longer security lines at airports , reduced military readiness , fewer border guards , pre-schoolers losing access to @entity231 programs and other problems if the full brunt of the spending cuts occur			1
where you 'll feel forced spending cuts @entity29 leaders , meanwhile , seek to blame @entity24 for the forced spending cuts so that any hardships that result , such as predicted job losses and reductions in economic growth , get attributed to the president			1
" the president 's sequester is the wrong way to reduce the deficit , but it is here to stay until @entity0 @entity39 get serious about cutting spending , " wrote @entity77 , @entity243 , in the op - ed. " the government simply can not keep delaying the inevitable and spending money it does n't have			2
so , as the president 's outrage about the sequester grows in coming days , @entity29 have a simple response : mr. president , we agree that your sequester is bad policy			2
what spending are you willing to cut to replace it ? " @entity13 passive as spending cuts near by using language such as " the president 's sequester , " @entity77 and @entity29 want to implant a public perception that the plan was @entity24 's all along			1
the @entity123 concedes that it raised the idea of forced budget cuts during the negotiations in 2011 on the debt ceiling deal , but argues @entity29 , including @entity77 and other @entity123 leaders , agreed to making it part of the deal and then voted for it			1
now , @entity170 says , @entity29 acted like they never supported the idea			0
he insisted thursday that @entity24 has offered the only legitimate compromise proposal for significant deficit reduction , noting the @entity277 determined the president 's plan would bring deficits below 3 % of gross domestic product by 2015 , which he called an accepted target by economists			2
@entity170 labeled any comparisons between what @entity24 proposes and the @entity29 stance as a " false equivalence , " arguing the president 's approach of spending cuts , entitlement reforms and new tax revenue is a compromise from a hard - line @entity296 position that rejects any benefit reductions in @entity298 , @entity299 and @entity300			1
" you come half way and your negotiating partner stays where he or she is , that makes it very difficult to reach a compromise , " @entity170 told reporters			0
" you need compromise from the other side			0
" in negotiations last december on the fiscal cliff agreement , @entity24 was willing to include a less generous inflation index for benefits such as @entity298 , despite vehement protests from his liberal base , @entity170 noted			0
" there 's some responsibility here on the @entity29 side to do what the president has done , which is to hear what the @entity325 people are saying , which is please compromise , please be reasonable , please do not adopt positions that represent a ' my way or the highway ' approach , " @entity170 said			0
@entity24 , @entity29 clash on forced spending cuts on wednesday , @entity170 defended @entity24 's campaign - style approach to generating public support for his stance on the issue , saying such pressure worked in the spending and deficit agreements of the past two years			1
" you know why they happened ? because the @entity325 people supported those positions that the president took , " @entity170 said			0
" and , in the end , @entity13 responded to the will of the @entity325 people			0
and we hope that 's what 's going to happen again this time			0
" a new poll on thursday showed a strong majority of @entity325 want the kind of comprehensive deficit reduction called for by @entity24 , but support for a stop - gap measure on the forced spending cuts was less certain			1
seven of 10 respondents in the @entity359 and @entity360 survey called major legislation to reduce the deficit the most important priority for @entity13 , and 76 % backed the combination of spending cuts and revenue increases favored by the president and @entity39			1
at the same time , 73 % want more spending cuts than tax increases while only about 20 % say the solution should be spending cuts alone			2
if the forced spending cuts go into effect , 49 % of respondents would blame republicans in @entity13 while 31 % would blame @entity24 , the poll showed			1
however , 49 % said the cuts should be delayed while 40 % said they should go into effect			0
@entity1 's @entity379 contributed to this report .			0
