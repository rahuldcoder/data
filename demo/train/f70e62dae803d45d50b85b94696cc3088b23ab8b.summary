-- on october 16 , 1962 , president @entity1 confirmed the presence of @entity4 nuclear missiles in @entity5 , thus beginning one of the most dangerous moments in modern history -- the @entity9			1
for the next 13 days , the @entity10 and the @entity4 would come frighteningly close to all - out nuclear war			1
fifty years later , a new interactive multimedia documentary provides viewers with an unflinching look inside the critical event			1
" @entity20 " gives audiences a front - row seat to what could have been a catastrophe			1
working closely with the @entity22 , filmmakers were given unprecedented access to letters , memos , documents and imagery , which viewers can engage with as the documentary plays			1
additionally , special real - time alerts can be set up to notify a viewer 's mobile devices to mirror the critical events of the 13 - day crisis			1
and , perhaps its boldest feature , the site also offers a terrifying companion film which imagines what might have been , had the worst not been avoided half a century ago			2
in an interview with @entity0 , actor @entity40 , who narrates the film , explains his involvement with the project , talks about his admiration for @entity1 , and shares what a successful 30 - year marriage can teach a man about the delicate art of diplomacy and negotiation			1
@entity0 : let 's talk about " @entity54			2
" @entity40 : ok , so this is an important documentary , because it enlightens a contemporary audience about the events that took place in the @entity59 on the brink of a nuclear disaster between two superpowers			1
there 's information that so many millions of @entity10 are not aware of that took place between president @entity1 and ( @entity68			2
it 's incredible to think how close we came to a nuclear holocaust			2
@entity0 : it gives me chills to think about			2
now , 50 years later , i understand you and the filmmakers were given unprecedented access by the @entity22 to make this documentary			1
is that right ? @entity79 : it is			1
a few years ago , i had the pleasure of reading a book about president @entity1 and his experiences as the captain of the @entity86 during the @entity87			2
and even if half the stuff in the book was an exaggeration , the 50 % that 's remaining makes me think that @entity1 was an absolute stud			2
and so now i have the honor of participating in this new @entity1 documentary about the @entity9			1
and intelligence and courage that he demonstrated against all odds is amazing			2
all of his advisers wanted him to engage @entity101 in a nuclear war , and he refused to take that route			2
he wanted to keep an open door policy and a conversation , a dialogue , with @entity107 to avoid our two nations from going to war			0
it was through intelligence and negotiation that war was avoided			0
it just makes me love him and admire him all the more			0
@entity0 : in addition to the documentary and interactive materials like presidential memos , photos and expert testimony , tell me about this " what if " scenario people can check out			1
@entity79 : yeah , absolutely			1
they hired actors to play the parts from the " what if " scenario , and when i first sat down to watch that part of the story , i was thinking , " jeez , i do n't remember reading about that			0
i do n't remember @entity10 getting hit by a nuclear bomb from @entity5			0
i do n't remember the nuclear bomb being dropped on @entity5			0
" it 's so well - performed and written and filmed that you 'll think that you missed something about history			0
@entity0 : is there a plan for giving this to schools ? @entity79 : the @entity22 wants to share it with as many people as possible , not just at the library , but online and on television			1
so , it depends on who becomes the next president of the @entity10			0
if @entity152 gets his way , there wo n't be any more public broadcasting			0
and this is an example of why @entity156 is important -- because it can bring these kinds of stories to the @entity10 people , to help educate us and help us learn why peaceful negotiation is more beneficial than hawkish behavior			1
@entity0 : you 've been married since 1980			0
i bet you know a few tricks about peaceful negotiation			0
@entity79 : i think i could teach @entity1 a thing or two about the art of negotiation ! ( laughter ) @entity171 and marriage are complicated things			1
fortunately , i was very good friends with my wife before i fell in love with her			0
love is something that is forever changing and metamorphosing			0
and what you hope , and occasionally get lucky , is you have a partner who you can grow with and not grow apart from			0
i 've been very fortunate that the journey i 've been on with @entity79 has been beautiful			1
@entity0 : that 's very nice to hear			0
i know a lot of your " @entity187 " fans would love to hear that they are breathing new life into that film			0
is there any chance of a remake or new chapter ? @entity79 : no , @entity194 would n't have it			1
@entity194 is no longer with us , but the fortunate thing is that you do n't need to remake the film			0
the unfortunate thing is that " @entity187 " is timeless , because we 're still solving our differences with military might , rather that the lessons we learned from men like @entity1 and the art of peaceful negotiations and diplomacy .			0
