eleven - year - old @entity0 says she remembers her father			2
it 's flashes of memory , really -- a smile , a laugh			1
she was only 4 when he was killed , but she ca n't recall vivid memories of him and their family when it was whole			2
her family was torn apart when her father , a policeman , was gunned down seven years ago on the streets of @entity15			1
she struggles to comprehend why anyone would have wanted to kill her father or why some people detonate explosives in the middle of a crowd			2
" why do these people kill other people ? do they get paid money to do it ? " she asks			0
why ? it 's a question likely asked by many at the @entity26 in @entity15 's @entity27 , a @entity28 enclave home to more than two million people			1
here , inside a rundown , two - story building , @entity0 is one of the more than 300 children who have been orphaned -- most in the @entity35 sense when a family loses its breadwinner			1
it 's almost always the father			1
most have a place to stay , with a mother or a distant relative			0
the center serves as day care center with a twist , a place where the children can go for food , clothing and education			1
in a city known for its violence , the center is full of children with tales of a parent lost to a bomb blast or a gunfight			1
in some cases , it 's a child whose parent was a suicide bomber			2
" we do n't differentiate , " says @entity63 , the center 's director			1
nobody is sure just how many @entity68 children have lost a parent to the sectarian violence that gripped the country after the 2003 @entity73 - led invasion			1
the @entity74 puts the number in the millions , while the @entity76 says it is hundreds of thousands			0
now with the death toll rising as @entity68 battles extremist fighters who have taken over large swaths of the country and vowed to overthrow the government , more and more children are being brought to @entity83			0
@entity63 started the children 's center in 2009 on the outskirts of @entity27			1
then there 10 children , she says			0
" i feel like i am falling short of what i need to do for the children			1
i always hope they have more			0
i try to make them happy with clothes , " says @entity63			0
" i feel bad for their mothers as salaries are really low and not enough to live on here in @entity68			2
" @entity0 and her best friend , 11 - year - old @entity99 , sit on a brown couch at the center giggling			0
they could n't be more different			0
@entity0 wears her hair pulled back in a green band with a pink bow , while @entity99 covers her hair with a traditional @entity35 headscarf known as a hijab			0
@entity109 is a friendship born from grief			0
@entity99 , too , lost her father			2
he was killed when a bomb exploded 10 months ago in @entity27 , she says			1
@entity99 and her four siblings now live with her paternal grandparents , who do n't have enough money to take care of all their needs			0
her 6 - year - old brother , @entity119 , never strays far from his sister			0
during a conversation about what happened to their family , he hangs on her every word			0
asked want he wants at the children 's center , he says better food			1
hamburgers ? pizza ? " shawarma , " he says			0
across the room , a woman bounces baby @entity135 on her lap. @entity135 , 1 , and her brother , 4 - year - old @entity137 , were found playing among the bodies of their parents			0
it was mid-afternoon on a cold january day when militants burst into the family 's home on the northern outskirts of @entity15 , a neighborhood known as @entity146			1
was it a revenge killing ? was it sectarian ? " we do n't know why it happened , " says @entity150 , the children 's aunt			2
she does n't like talking about what happened that day as she worries it will remind the children of what they have lost			2
women train with ak - 47s to defend the streets of @entity15 @entity68 to split in three : so why not ? how @entity161 is overshadowing @entity162			1

@entity26 in @entity15 's @entity27 helps with food , clothing and education
they come from families where the breadwinner has been lost to violence
