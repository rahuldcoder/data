-- @entity1 could be an excellent presidential candidate for the @entity2 in 2016			1
after suffering through an extremely difficult loss in the primaries against @entity6 , @entity3 has managed to strengthen her resume			1
as secretary of state , she improved her standing on foreign policy and earned more respect among @entity2 who had been skeptical of her positions ever since her vote on the resolution to authorize force in @entity17 in 2002			0
the press has been showering praise on @entity3 in recent months			1
even though the next presidential election is more than three years away , there have been numerous stories about how @entity3 can dominate the nomination process			1
polls show that she comes out ahead of most democrats as well as prominent @entity27 , such as @entity29 gov. @entity28 and @entity31 sen. @entity30			0
one poll conducted by the @entity33 found that 67 % of @entity34 have a favorable view of @entity3			1
the @entity36 has already launched its website			0
" we are going to keep up the energy and excitement surrounding her potential candidacy , " said the @entity39 's chairwoman , @entity40			2
there have even been articles about why she is not the inevitable candidate , the kind of discussion that only tends to fuel the perception that she is at the top of the heap			0
@entity3 hints at run for @entity1 but @entity3 needs to be careful			1
in 2008 , @entity6 turned @entity3 's experience as first lady and senator into a liability			1
back then , @entity3 was also seen as the experienced candidate who would inevitably win the nomination			1
when @entity3 won the @entity64 primary after a stunning loss in @entity66 , many reporters credited her experience			1
@entity3 did not back away from this image			2
" i put forth my lifetime of experience , " she said			0
" senator @entity6 will put forth a speech he made in 2002			0
" sensing the mood of the @entity2 electorate , @entity6 capitalized on the fact that he was not a @entity77 insider			0
he aggressively attacked @entity3 by depicting her as the quintessential politician who was shaped by the @entity80 , someone who voters could not trust to keep her word , and a @entity84 who would certainly disappoint loyal members of the party by sticking to the status quo			2
while @entity3 's supporters boasted that no other candidate matched her skills , with each @entity6 victory , the press became more excited about the unexpected turn in the contest			1
@entity6 did what @entity95 did in 1976 , when he took on @entity77 heavyweights such as @entity98 and @entity99 by making experience a bad word			0
@entity102 did the same to his @entity27 opponents in 1980 , including @entity104 , whose sterling record turned into a huge liability with primary voters			2
in an era when voters distrust the government , they can often see value in the person with less experience in the system			0
and in an era when reporters cover elections like horse races , the underdog is often the most exciting person to write about			0
of course , @entity3 was anything but " just " a @entity77 insider			2
that image was as much the creation of her opponent 's political campaign as her own			0
opinion : @entity1 , a mistake for 2016 her campaign could easily have depicted her as someone who would be a fresh voice in @entity77 -- the first female president , a person who had struggled to make the role of the first lady something bigger , a fighter who had taken on the aggressive conservative establishment , even as her husband betrayed her before the public eye			1
while in the @entity142 , @entity3 displayed remarkable skills at winning over support among many skeptics , including @entity27 who had once fought to impeach her husband			1
yes , this is about experience in @entity77 , but her success was also a considerable asset that few politicians possess			0
with all the praise that is being showered on her potential candidacy , it 's easy to see @entity3 facing the same challenges if she decides to run in 2016			1
@entity3 will have to remember the lessons of 2008			2
@entity3 certainly deserves all the positive coverage , but she ca n't let it define her			1
for if she does decide to declare her candidacy , there might be so little excitement left by the time that it is made that the media will turn their attention to any fresh voice , such as @entity171 gov. @entity170 , who is an extremely potent politician			2
the narrative that campaigns tell about a candidate plays a huge role in the outcome of a contest			0
@entity3 has an impressive story to tell			1
she has championed women 's rights for decades			0
she embodies the drive for female equality by shattering many glass ceilings			0
she has deep political experiences at home and abroad			0
more than anyone at the moment , she has the potential to be @entity34 's female president			0
if she runs , @entity3 needs to make sure that her @entity2 as well as @entity27 opponents do n't turn her strength into a weakness once again			1
@entity3 needs to find the right balance between selling her experiences and skills and keeping the excitement that her candidacy could bring to a @entity2 ticket			1
she needs to sell the message that her candidacy is distinct and historic			2
and if she could bring enthusiastic and idealistic supporters to the ballot box just as @entity6 was able to do , then she has a chance to truly make history			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity207 : @entity1 could be an excellent presidential candidate in 2016
@entity207 : but @entity3 has to be careful , as her experience can turned into a liability by rivals
he says @entity3 needs to sell her skills as well as keep her candidacy exciting and fresh
@entity207 : the former first lady has an impressive story to tell but ca n't let others define her
