-- @entity2 , as diplomats say , likes to " punch above its weight			1
" this arid peninsula in the @entity5 is smaller than @entity6 but played a leading role in helping @entity9 rebels oust @entity10 and has been at the heart of @entity13 sanctions against @entity14			1
it 's now facilitating talks on the @entity18 conflict by allowing the @entity19 to open a liaison office in its capital , @entity22			1
@entity2 is also home to the @entity25 news channel @entity24 , a thorn in the side of many @entity29 regimes past and present			1
it is a major player in the energy industry , with vast reserves of natural gas , and -- perhaps in an effort to outflank @entity35 as the playground of the @entity5 -- is due to host the soccer @entity37 in 2022			0
it helps that the emirate is fabulously wealthy , with the highest per - capita gross domestic product in the world			0
it can fund ambitious initiatives -- to help fund the @entity45 , for example , or provide cash and weapons to the @entity9 rebels			2
now it 's exploiting long - held ties with the @entity19 to provide a platform between the group and the international community , and especially the @entity54			1
will @entity19 's @entity2 address change dynamics of @entity18 conflict ? as far back as 2001 , before the group was ousted in @entity18 , the @entity2 hosted @entity19 delegations			1
and in the past year , thanks to its hyperactive diplomacy under prime minister ( and foreign minister ) @entity63 , the emirate has emerged as a regional power broker -- to the consternation of its larger neighbor , @entity67			1
@entity2 's growing dynamism within the @entity13 has been most evident amid the unrest in @entity9 and @entity14			2
it was one of two @entity29 states to play a role in enforcing the no - fly zone over @entity9			0
and according to journalists in western @entity9 last spring , @entity2 advisers were working with @entity9 rebels in the @entity77 as well as supplying anti-tank missiles and other weaponry to rebel forces in the east			1
in november , @entity2 forged a package of sanctions against the regime of @entity85 that was adopted by the @entity13 , provoking an attack on its embassy in @entity88 and the withdrawal of the @entity2 ambassador			2
it lobbied other @entity29 states hard , telling them that effective @entity29 action was required to avoid " foreign interference " in @entity14			0
@entity2 was also ready to use the power of the purse with @entity14 by canceling projects there			1
as part of intensive efforts to build a relationship with the @entity54 , @entity2 has allowed @entity54 forces to use the al - udeid air base for operations in @entity104 , @entity18 and @entity105			1
it also hosts the forward headquarters of the @entity107			0
over the past 10 years , @entity2 has also offered to be the go - between in @entity108 for successive @entity54 administrations			1
according to a 2006 @entity54 diplomatic cable , foreign minister @entity63 told a @entity54 official , with some pride : " @entity2 talks to @entity108 as an equal , and this is important			2
" the two countries are joined at the hip , as they share vast natural gas reserves under the @entity5			0
and it is a principle of @entity2 diplomacy that it will cultivate groups that wo n't talk to each other -- @entity120 and @entity108 as well as @entity121			2
@entity2 also offered to help the @entity54 improve relations with @entity124 tribal leaders in @entity104 at the height of the insurgency there			2
the emir , @entity129 , and his family drive @entity2 policy and have proved themselves agile negotiators with a grasp of the intricacies of @entity136 politics			2
@entity54 diplomatic cables describe @entity2 officials as well - prepared with a detailed understanding of the nuances of their complex neighborhood			1
the @entity143 has worked in @entity2 's favor			0
one of the few states where no protests have occurred , it has taken advantage of @entity67 caution and upheavals in @entity150 and @entity14 to carve out an assertive regional role			0
but @entity2 's activism generates plenty of resentment			0
the populism of @entity24 has infuriated @entity29 regimes			0
the emir fends off complaints about @entity24 's reporting , telling @entity0 's @entity160 last year : " of course it 's not necessary i will agree with what @entity24 say			0
actually , @entity24 caused for me a lot of problems			0
" similarly , the @entity67 are suspicious of @entity2 's open channel with @entity108			1
president @entity166 of @entity167 put an end to @entity2 efforts to mediate between his government and @entity172 rebels			1
and president @entity173 recalled the @entity18 envoy in @entity22 in december because he 'd been kept in the dark about contacts with the @entity19			0
but the @entity177 are not afraid to ruffle feathers			0
in the diplomatic world , as one @entity5 commentator observed , @entity2 is proof that size is n't everything .			0
