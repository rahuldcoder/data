-- investigators are on the verge of solving the last of the @entity4 killings of the 1960s , thanks to new dna tests and a sample secretly collected from a relative of longtime suspect @entity10			1
dna taken from a water bottle thrown away by one of @entity10 's nephews is a " familial match " with genetic material preserved in the january 1964 killing of 19 - year - old @entity20 , @entity12 district attorney @entity11 said thursday			1
" this is good evidence , strong evidence and reliable evidence , but it 's not sufficient to close the case with absolute certainty , " @entity11 told reporters			0
dna from @entity10 's remains is needed to prove " once and for all " that the onetime handyman was @entity20 's killer -- and perhaps to close other cases to which @entity10 confessed			1
the @entity33 killings terrorized @entity34 from mid- 1962 to early 1964			1
@entity11 said 11 murders have been attributed to @entity10 -- who confessed to the killings -- including @entity20			1
he also confessed to two additional murders who were not suspected victims of the @entity33			2
city of fear : photos from the @entity34 strangler era , 1963 @entity10 was never charged with the murders			1
he was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes			2
" there was no forensic evidence to link @entity10 to @entity20 's murder until today , " @entity11 said			1
the new dna match now excludes " 99.9 % " of the population as suspects , he said -- and now that a judge has approved @entity10 's exhumation , the dna match could be confirmed in " a matter of days			2
" as for the rest of the victims , the developments " give us a glimmer of hope that there can one day be finality , if not accountability , " for their families , @entity11 said			0
the news has convinced @entity20 's nephew , @entity69 , who wrote a 2001 book in which he argued another man may have been behind the @entity33 killings			1
he said thursday that he was surprised his aunt 's slaying was still being investigated and told reporters , " i go where the evidence leads			0
" " it 's taken 49 years for police to legitimately say they got their man , and they 'll probably be able to say that very soon , " @entity69 said			0
he spoke emotionally of the closure the news will bring to him and his mother , @entity85 , @entity20 's younger sister			2
" it 's amazing to me today to understand that people really did care what happened to my aunt , a 19 - year - old girl heinously murdered in 1964 , " he said			2
but a lawyer for the @entity92 told @entity0 the family was " outraged , disgusted and offended " by the decision to secretly take a dna sample one of its members , a move she called " unnecessary and creepy			1
" " they feel victimized by this process , " the attorney , @entity98 , said			0
" this was an unwarranted invasion of privacy by a government agency			0
we have offered them dna as recently as last year , there was no reason to sneak around to get it			1
" @entity11 said scientists tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate dna evidence from semen found in @entity20 's body and on a blanket			2
they resumed their efforts last year , after a laboratory successfully salvaged dna from decades - old material , and found what they believe is the unique genetic profile of @entity20 's killer			1
@entity124 : fast facts despite an exhaustive search , investigators found no usable samples of @entity10 's @entity107 to compare to the material from the crime scene			1
so @entity34 police commissioner @entity131 said he had a detective from the police department 's fugitive squad shadow @entity10 relatives until he spotted one of the suspect 's nephews throwing away a water bottle			2
" that water bottle was tested , and the match came back , " he said			0
" we 've been sitting on that information for a while , so that all the reports could come back , and we could put ourselves in a position to petition the court for an exhumation order , so that we can positively close that case up			0
" the nephew was working at an outdoor construction site when he threw away the plastic bottle , which was retrieved by plainclothes investigators , according to a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity11 said authorities did n't ask the @entity10 family for their cooperation , but he defended the secret collection of their dna as " a fair and legal and ethical method			1
" he said they " did nothing wrong , " but " found themselves in the shadow of accusations that could never be fully proven or discounted			0
" " we would probably have given them a lot of anxiety , perhaps , if we had approached them directly , " he said			0
" if this familial examination pointed us in a different directions , then we would n't have even have had to involve them any further			0
" @entity10 's brother , @entity172 , offered blood and saliva samples at that time in hopes of proving his brother 's innocence in 2001			2
those tests had been unable to find a match between @entity10 family @entity107 and the killings , but @entity11 discounted them thursday because they were n't conducted by law enforcement			1
@entity98 said @entity172 's dna would have been a closer match than the nephew 's , she said			0
and the family offered samples of @entity10 's dna that are in control of an independent forensic scientist , she said			1
" they said they would get back to us and they never did , " she said			0
" instead , they went sneaking around			0
" @entity0 's @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity92 " outraged , disgusted " by secret @entity107 collection , their attorney says
@entity206 : " we have offered them dna as recently as last year , " the attorney says
dna from a relative links @entity10 to the last @entity33 victim , @entity20
@entity10 was never charged in the killings and was stabbed to death in 1973
