-- a number of establishment republicans are privately blasting former rep. @entity3 and his comments about considering a run for the chairmanship of the @entity7			1
they call him arrogant for even suggesting he could do the job , and some have said the talk is more about his ego than a vision for the party			0
in fact , he has been likened to former @entity7 chairman @entity16			1
both are conservative , but clearly that comparison is based on their skin color and not anything else			0
the @entity22 establishment should tread carefully here , because even if members choose not to vote for @entity3 -- if he decides to even seek the job -- it is his skin color and perspective that is central to the @entity22 having any sort of presidential future			1
we might as well not play footsie : the @entity22 is a group largely composed of and targeting white @entity31			1
yes , there are minority @entity22			1
but considering how president @entity34 was able to destroy @entity35 at the ballot box last month with a racial coalition that rolled up massive support among blacks , hispanics and @entity41 , the @entity22 has a problem			1
the day has passed when the @entity22 can win the presidency by focusing on white @entity31			1
folks , this is simple math. with the nation moving toward becoming a majority - minority country , the @entity22 can not afford to continue to ignore , alienate and , frankly , tick off minority voters			1
what @entity3 is trying to do is to get party leaders to understand that as a former college football legend at the @entity52 , he knows when a failed game plan needs to be thrown out			2
in football , if you lose , you often get rid of the coach and find someone who can recruit better players to put you on the path to winning			0
opinion : @entity22 , break @entity62 's grip on you does that mean the @entity22 should throw out @entity7 chairman @entity66 ? not necessarily			1
but it is abundantly clear that the modern - day @entity22 had better find a new game plan or it is going to be on the outside of the @entity70 for quite some time			1
@entity3 is no stranger to this discussion			2
when he served in the leadership of the @entity73 as a member of @entity75 from @entity76 , he often tried to quietly address these issues within the party , and his comments often fell on deaf ears			0
now @entity3 can look to his @entity7 buddies and say , " did n't i tell you ? now are y'all ready to pay attention ? " but as long as guys like @entity35 surrogate @entity86 , a former @entity87 governor and chief of staff to president @entity89 , continue to assert that people voted for president @entity34 because of handouts , the @entity22 will resemble that old , drunk uncle you hate to invite over for family dinners because he manages to make everyone look foolish			1
the @entity22 's problem is n't that its members have to better explain its policies to minorities			1
no. it 's that they all need to shut up and listen			1
because every time top @entity22 officials open their mouths , all they seem to do is insult the very people they need to vote for them			1
it is about having a dialogue			0
it 's about listening to what @entity31 desire and seeing where there is agreement , whether it 's education , the environment , entrepreneurship , sentencing reform , immigration or a host of other issues			0
too often , the @entity22 is afraid to talk to minorities , especially black folks , and that results in turning them off in a huge way			2
and just saying , " look ! we have elected some minorities to office " ai n't gon na cut it			0
how did having a @entity131 governor in @entity132 and @entity135 sen. @entity134 help @entity35 in the last election ? @entity3 understands that being able to commuincate with black , @entity131 and @entity138 business owners about issues other than taxes is going to make a difference			2
sorry , @entity22 , just touting smaller government and fewer taxes wo n't cut it			2
the discussion must be broad and touch upon the issues that affect these voters every day			0
and the only way a @entity66 can even understand how to talk to and work with black folks is having a relationship with the likes of @entity3 , @entity150 , @entity152 education commissioner @entity151 , @entity135 lt. gov. @entity153 , @entity155 rep. @entity154 , former @entity156 and @entity157 chairman @entity158 and so many others and say , " please , take the time to educate me on the issues and concerns resonating among black folks , and how our agenda can appeal to them			1
" then you sit back , shut up and take notes			1
opinion : the @entity22 is tone - deaf on fiscal cliff the same needs to happen with other constituencies that the @entity171 has dominated			2
this is the only effective way the @entity22 will come to grips with the enormous problems it has in these communities			2
the party first must know why there is so much resistance , and then go about methodically addressing the issues			0
and that will mean having an extraordinary outreach program that must be funded and staffed			0
the fact is , the massive outreach effort that is needed may not pay off for the @entity22 in 2016			2
but laying the groundwork today could mean seeing the fruits of that labor then and beyond			0
but i can guarantee the @entity22 one thing : if it ignores minority constituents and dismisses them , it will get destroyed at the ballot box			0
the only way for fruits to grow is if the seed is planted , cultivated and tended to			0
the @entity22 has been unwilling to get its hands dirty and do the hard work when it comes to minority voters			0
keep it up and it will starve to death			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

former rep. @entity3 might run for the chairmanship of the @entity7
some establishment republicans are blasting him , says @entity201
but if the @entity22 wants any kind of future , it should listen to @entity3 very *closely* , @entity201 says
it 's time for the @entity22 to " sit back , shut up and take notes , " says @entity201
