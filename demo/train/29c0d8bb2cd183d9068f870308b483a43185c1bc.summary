another big challenge facing president @entity1 and some new twists on key 2014 dynamics and players surfaced during our weekly trip around the " @entity8 " table			2
@entity9 is unwelcome but @entity10 is in demand @entity12 -- not @entity1 -- is the @entity1 who will be racking up some miles in the seven - week sprint to @entity15			2
@entity16 of the @entity17 reports that the first lady 's @entity19 staff is pouring through campaign requests and filling her calendar with travel plans			1
" @entity25 is , in many ways , is the keeper of the @entity1 flame , " said @entity24			1
" they very much think that she is still someone that can fire up the base : african - americans , latinos and women			0
" @entity10 stumped for @entity35 this month , with the aim to help generate critical @entity39 - @entity38 turnout in @entity40			0
@entity41 is also on the schedule			2
the @entity39 - @entity38 population there is tiny , but there is a neck - and - neck @entity47 race , @entity25 loves the state , and the thinking is she can try to motivate younger voters who were critical to president @entity1 's wins but often sit out the midterms			1
and , there will be more			0
speaker @entity55 steps up with the election seven weeks away , house speaker @entity55 is taking a more aggressive role as a @entity59 strategist and spokesman			1
@entity61 of the @entity17 tells us @entity55 is making a mark on domestic and foreign policy			1
he has an economic speech on the books and took a lead role this past week in shaping @entity59 reaction to the president 's nationally televised address on the @entity72 threat			1
next week , the speaker will be taking center stage to try to pass a government funding bill and get some kind of legislation passed to push @entity1 's strategy through @entity79			1
" i think @entity55 has the political capital right now to do both , " said @entity61			1
" and with @entity82 gone , he 's really becoming the face for the @entity59 ahead of the midterm elections			2
the @entity59 's closing argument the rise of terrorism as an issue is viewed as a potential plus for @entity59 in key 2014 battlegrounds			1
@entity91 of @entity92 highlighted a handful of close @entity47 races where the @entity59 thinks the terrorism / security issue is a plus for their candidates			1
one example is @entity99 , where sen. @entity100 highlights his role as a congressional leader on national security matters and portrays his opponent as inexperienced			2
and @entity91 notes in four other states with close @entity47 races -- @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity41 and @entity108 -- the @entity59 candidates have military backgrounds			1
a @entity112 loss in @entity113 may not end up as a @entity59 gain @entity115 has not been kind to the @entity59 in congressional races in recent years , but the @entity59 has several seats on its target list as it looks to expand its @entity120 majority			2
but one of those opportunities became less likely this past week , according to several @entity59 strategists			0
@entity112 rep. @entity124 lost his 6th @entity126 primary to @entity128 war veteran @entity127			0
republicans nominated @entity130 , a moderate former state legislator who narrowly lost to @entity131 in 2012			0
that was a presidential cycle , when turnout is higher and @entity1 was winning big			0
the @entity59 hoped a rematch in this more @entity59 - leaning year might get them a pickup			0
now , @entity136 is the @entity112 candidate			0
as a newcomer to politics , he ca n't be tarred as a @entity141 insider , and his military service is viewed as a plus as terrorism concerns rise as an issue			1
@entity131 is a friend of @entity147 @entity146 , and so his loss did n't sit well with party leaders in @entity141			1
but in the long run it could turn out to be a blessing in an otherwise tough midterm year for the @entity112			0
@entity154 , @entity72 and now @entity155 for the president 's agenda it 's off to @entity159 this week for president @entity1 , who is scheduled to visit the @entity161			2
he 'll be there ratchet up the @entity120 response to the @entity155 crisis in @entity165			0
@entity166 of @entity167 reports the president will make the case that helping more is right for humanitarian and national security reasons			0
" this is one of those times where we actually have to give the @entity120 a little bit of credit for good management , " said @entity166			0
" they want to be prepared and be able to say that even in the middle of everything else that was going on , this is something the president was focusing on			0

@entity25 's busy fall travel schedule .
speaker @entity55 is taking a more aggressive role on the trail and in @entity141 .
