@entity0 -- in politics , a week may feel like an eternity			0
exactly a week ago , @entity5 president @entity4 suffered a momentous blow , the first real shock of his presidency			1
his recently dismissed budget minister , @entity9 , a former hair implant surgeon - turned - socialist , confessed on his blog that he had been lying for the last four months and that he had , in fact , a hidden @entity12 bank account which the @entity5 inland revenue services never knew about			1
in other words , the man in charge of tackling tax evasion was admitting to being a fraudster			1
not only this , but he had lied outright in parliament , in front of the nation 's representatives			0
to utter lies in @entity25 may not constitute a crime ( unlike in the @entity27 , there is no such thing as perjury in @entity5 ) , however , the @entity5 were shocked to discover that a minister had had the nerve to deny the truth in the @entity35 's most symbolic and sacred of places			2
a few hours later , @entity4 pre-recorded a message to his fellow countrymen			2
he would take immediate measures , he said , to restore the country 's confidence in its political class and , no , he knew nothing of his @entity45 minister 's wrongdoings			2
from left to right , everyone in @entity5 was reeling from the news			2
polls suggested that 65 % of the @entity5 wanted @entity25 to be dissolved and new elections to take place , others that 60 % of the @entity5 people wanted , at the very least , a cabinet reshuffle or change of government			2
while @entity4 had to leave for an official two - day visit to @entity59 , his prime minister @entity56 announced that anyone found guilty of tax - dodging would be banned from holding public office			1
the opposition immediately accused @entity64 , the economy minister to whom @entity65 reported , of acting too slowly , and too late			0
@entity66 , the news website which broke the story over @entity9 's @entity12 account last november , asserted that @entity64 had effectively tried to shield his colleague			2
the atmosphere became toxic ; rumours started circulating about other potential tax fraudsters serving in government			0
@entity75 was this week heavily criticised for making allegations without giving any evidence			0
today , its editor apologised and recognized his mistake			0
in another televised message -- the second within a week -- @entity4 gave his ministers until monday april 15 to reveal their personal assets ; parliament is to consider a bill making such disclosures compulsory for the entire political class			0
until now , @entity5 and @entity88 were the only two countries to have opted out from this measure of financial transparency , already implemented at a @entity93 level			0
president @entity4 also announced that he was creating a new agency to fight financial fraud , and appointing a special prosecutor to deal with financial crime			1
he said banks would now be forced to detail all their activities in tax havens , with the publication of all their international affiliates and subsidiaries , country by country			0
a few discordant voices from @entity111 's right - wing @entity110 party complained that revealing private assets amounted to " voyeurism " and " hypocrisy "			0
resorting to irony , @entity115 of the far - right @entity116 declared on national radio : " my @entity12 bank account was always known to the @entity5 tax revenue and i wear pants made in @entity5 "			1
however , the mood of the public in @entity5 is very much in favor of a moralization of public life and @entity4 's measures have been received with guarded optimism			1
it is indeed not the first time a @entity5 president has promised to crush immorality in politics			1
" @entity65 " has struck @entity5 consciences as deeply as @entity136 's sex scandal in 2011			2
tax evasion , a national sport in @entity5 till the 1980s and a massive crackdown by then prime minister @entity140 , was thought , in the main , to be a thing of the past			1
but suddenly it has made a come - back at the most sensitive of times			0
@entity5 has 3 million unemployed people and faces deep economic problems , including a loss of competitiveness			0
could @entity4 's government fall over this sleaze scandal ? it could if more tax evasion revelations affecting members of the government were to come out but it probably wo n't if it acts swiftly and @entity9 remains the only black sheep on the horizon			1
the question now is , will @entity4 take advantage of " @entity161 " to form a new government with a new prime minister ? significantly , centrist @entity164 , whose last - minute decision to back @entity167 ois @entity4 was a crucial factor in @entity4 's presidential election victory , and who has campaigned for years to clean up @entity5 political life , made a public statement and declared himself ready to serve			1
having reached a new low in the popularity polls , with only 27 % of the @entity5 supporting him , president @entity4 may be tempted to look for a new prime minister with a strong image of integrity			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0
