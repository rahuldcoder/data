-- the infiltration of a @entity4 terror network by a mole who helped foil a plot to blow up a @entity9 - bound plane was a " phenomenal , " " brilliant " and " powerful " success , experts said wednesday			1
it 's unclear how much of the credit should go to the @entity9 or to @entity15 , for whom sources say the mole was working , but both countries have delivered a practical and psychological setback to @entity21 , analysts on the region said			1
@entity23 officials describe that affiliate as @entity21 's most dangerous			2
" it 's a devastating blow to @entity21 , though not a fatal one , " said @entity25 , who was deputy national security adviser for combating terrorism under president @entity27			2
" what this demonstrates is that we have the ability to get on the inside			1
" and the plot , by the same group that launched a failed attempt to bomb a @entity9 - bound airliner on christmas 2009 , demonstrates the continued " rise of the affiliates , " he said			1
" we have a decimated @entity21 core -- the @entity21 of 2001 that we have battled and really dismantled in many ways has metastasized and is now presenting itself in this regional form			0
" this latest intelligence success marks the deepest known penetration into @entity21 , said @entity45 , a former @entity46 official who oversaw highly sensitive international terrorism cases			1
but he noted many intelligence efforts remain secret			1
" it 's a major success for the @entity50 and for the intelligence community , " he said			1
and , he noted , as in this case with @entity15 , " overseas most of our work is done in cooperation with friendly services			2
" of the @entity21 affiliate groups trying to carry out terrorist operations today , @entity21 is the closest version to the network @entity61 led , @entity45 said			2
@entity62 , who spent 30 years in the @entity50 and was a senior adviser on the @entity4 to four presidents , said thwarting the bomb plot is " primarily a @entity15 success story " -- and not their first			1
" they foiled the @entity21 plot in october 2010 to send bombs to the @entity9 on @entity72 and @entity73 planes , " he noted			2
that plot was foiled by an informant			0
this time , @entity78 said , @entity15 intelligence managed to " get access to @entity21 's plot and actually get the bomb			1
" still , thwarting this attack does n't damage the organization substantially in the big picture , analysts said			0
" while this is a good technical success , the harsh reality is that in @entity89 , @entity21 is growing , getting more powerful , recruiting more assets and taking advantage of the fact that @entity89 is essentially the @entity93 of the @entity94 -- it 's falling apart , broken , " said @entity78 , now a senior fellow at the @entity87			2
@entity0 terrorism analyst @entity95 added that while it is a " big intelligence success " for the @entity9 and @entity15 , " there 's a limit to their success as well			1
" the operation did not lead intelligence services to @entity103 , the chief bomb maker for @entity21 , or to the location where he makes the bombs			1
" they were able to take out @entity107 , who 's a senior operational planner in the group , but they were not able to take out this very dangerous bomb maker who 's ingenious at making bombs , " @entity95 noted			1
information from the mole led to a @entity50 drone strike sunday in @entity89 that killed @entity107 , 37 , a senior operative of the @entity21 affiliate			0
he was a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the @entity120 in @entity89			0
he was convicted in a @entity89 court but escaped from jail			0
all the analysts who spoke to @entity0 expressed concern that a mole 's involvement was leaked to the media			2
" i think authorities , particularly the @entity50 , would rather not talk about this right now , " said @entity25 , now a senior adviser on counterterrorism for the @entity129			0
these kinds of sources " can lead to additional counterterrorism successes or insights , " he said			0
" so the fact that this is now front page news certainly does n't help			0
" @entity45 , who runs a consultancy group on security issues , said , " when you 're doing operations like this , you have to do whatever you can do to protect sources and methods -- not only of the @entity50 but also of the other intelligence services that were involved in this			1
because down the road they will be hesitant to cooperate with us			0
" however , @entity25 said , there may be a bit of a silver lining in the leak			0
" i think what this will do is it will increase the amount of vigilance and mistrust within @entity21 circles to outsiders			0
they need outsiders to supplement their ranks and allow them to plot against the @entity164			0
... it will create layers of distrust and will create inefficiencies , " @entity25 said .			0

analyst : the intelligence success on bomb plot shows " the ability to get on the inside "
it 's " primarily a @entity15 success story , " another expert says
@entity180 did not lead to the terrorist group 's chief bomb maker , one analyst says
the leak that a mole was involved could damage intelligence efforts , experts say
