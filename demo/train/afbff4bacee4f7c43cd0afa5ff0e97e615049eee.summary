" we are building our cooperation , " he said , acknowledging that unilateral action could have " dire implications			0

" we need to use modern technologies , crowd sourcing , " he said			0

@entity6 has faced wide criticism over his treatment , with the @entity36 and others accusing it of " selective prosecution " and abuse of the legal system			0
his son , in his letter to policymakers at @entity0 , called on them to raise the issue of the former @entity188 chief executive 's continued imprisonment and urge support for the rule of law in @entity6			2
" ending corruption is not just a human rights issue , " @entity162 said			0
" the proliferation of corruption remains a huge impediment to direct foreign investment			1
" both @entity36 and @entity6 officials have publicly acknowledged @entity6 's weak property rights and rampant corruption are reasons to avoid doing business in @entity6			2
this is thwarting job creation and starving @entity6 businesses of the capital they need to grow			0
" @entity3 's comments come amid frosty relations with the @entity36 after @entity107 signed a law in december prohibiting @entity36 from adopting @entity6 children			1
the move by @entity6 politicians was widely seen as retaliation for a law that @entity36 president @entity215 signed december 14			0
