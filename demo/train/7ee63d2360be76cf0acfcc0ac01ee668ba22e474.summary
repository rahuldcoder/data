@entity0 -- @entity2 , husband of @entity4 @entity3 , has died of cancer at age 78			1
a statement from the @entity4 said @entity3 died sunday at his @entity0 home , due to complications from metastatic cancer			1
the court said a private ceremony will be held at @entity13 , but no date was given			0
@entity3 , known as @entity15 to his friends and family , was the outgoing , jovial opposite of his soft - spoken , diminutive wife , but the couple maintained a strong , happy marriage over 56 years			1
their wedding anniversary was four days ago			1
the @entity4 will wrap up its work for the term monday , and recess for the summer			1
@entity3 was on the bench as recently as thursday as rulings were announced			2
until his recent illness , @entity3 worked as a lawyer at the @entity0 law firm @entity31 , and as a professor at @entity33			1
he was constant presence at his wife 's side at many social and court - related events			2
@entity3 was known inside the court for cooking meals for the justices , their families , and for his wife 's law clerks , a skill he picked up when discovering his wife possessed few culinary talents			1
that became a running joke in the family , and one which the justice regaled audiences with over the years , somewhat sheepishly			0
" professor @entity3 is a regular contributor to the lighter side of life at the @entity4 , " said the justice in march 2009			1
" mainly he performs in the kitchen , for the quarterly spouses ' lunches held at the court and , occasionally in past years , at a dinner for the entire court family -- justices , their spouses , and widows of former @entity4 members			2
in the beginning , when i was the newest justice , my dear husband offered aid in lightening my load			0
" @entity3 , who joined the @entity4 in 1993 , long credited her husband 's open - mindedness for the success she has enjoyed in her legal , academic , and judicial career , especially at a time decades ago when women were encouraged to stay home and devote their energies to supporting their spouses			1
@entity2 @entity81 was born in 1932 and grew up in @entity82 , @entity83			2
he met his future wife on a blind date at @entity86 , and they married in 1954			0
after he served a stint in the military , the couple both attended @entity91			0
during his third year , @entity3 developed a rare form of testicular cancer and underwent two surgeries			1
he credited his recovery in part to wife 's ability to juggle caring for him , their young daughter , and their dual legal studies			0
he later worked as a lawyer in @entity83 and a professor at @entity105 's law school , where @entity3 had transferred and graduated			1
unlike her husband , the future justice was unable to find a job at her alma mater or any decent offers at a law firm , so she began teaching at @entity114 , and developed a national reputation taking on gender discrimination cases			0
he was known for quietly helping build and organize political support for his wife 's appointments to those top government jobs			0
the justice has called her husband her " best friend and biggest booster			0
" " a supportive husband who is willing to share duties and responsibilities is a must for any woman who hopes to combine marriage and a career , " she recently told a forum on professional opportunities for female lawyers			0
" through his friendship with billionaire businessman and onetime presidential candidate @entity138 , a special position -- or " chair " in academic circles -- was created at @entity33 for the study of tax law , and named in @entity2 's honor			1
it was less than successful , however , as the professor himself explained in his professional resume			0
" in 1986 , someone who probably prefers never to be identified endowed a chair in @entity150 in his name at @entity33 , " wrote @entity3			2
" no one appears willing to occupy the @entity3 chair , and it remains vacant , " a fact he always laughed about			2
the @entity156 had two children , @entity158 -- a professor at @entity105 -- @entity160 , an independent record producer in @entity161 , and four grandchildren .			0
