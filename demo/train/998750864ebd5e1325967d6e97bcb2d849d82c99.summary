@entity23 , nicknamed @entity41 , has the genetic disorder @entity42 , which delays growth , development and intellectual abilities			1
people with this syndrome have unusual physical features such as dry skin , curvature of the spine , dental problems , cleft palate or cleft lip , and weak muscle tone that can cause short stature , according to the @entity57			0
depending on the type of @entity42 , the median life expectancy is no higher than 34 years , according to a 2001 study published in the @entity61			0
@entity23 has been a patient at the @entity36 almost all her life , said her father , @entity24			0
but her kidneys are failing , according to the @entity65			0
her nephrologist estimated she has six months to one year before needing a transplant , the girl 's parents said			1
in the blog entry , @entity19 detailed a doctor 's visit on january 10			2
she wrote that a doctor on the transplant team and a social worker said that @entity23 could not be a candidate for kidney transplant " because of her mental delays			1
" the doctor warned that the @entity81 has to take after a transplant are very dangerous and could cause seizures and brain damage , the blog post said			1
according to @entity24 , she was told that it was a different case for @entity23 compared with other children , because " she is already brain damaged and mentally retarded			2

" instead he ( the doctor ) gives us a paper that said she 's mentally retarded so she does n't qualify			1
" his wife ended her blog post urging readers to share @entity23 's story			0
" we are in the year 2012 and my child still does not have the right to live , the right to a transplant , because she is developmentally delayed , " @entity24 wrote			1
without knowing the child 's medical information , it 's impossible to know whether there were other factors that shaped the doctor 's recommendation regarding @entity23 's transplant			1
on its @entity40 page , @entity36 stated that , " we do not disqualify potential transplant candidates on the basis of intellectual abilities			2
we have transplanted many children with a wide range of disabilities , including physical and mental disabilities			2
" in response to the barrage of comments on its @entity40 page , the hospital wrote : " we 're listening			1
we hear your concerns and take seriously your posts , emails and phone calls			0
" during a discussion on @entity35 tuesday , former prosecutor @entity146 said , " i would love to hear from the hospital , because these hospitals are constantly in fear of being sued , " and said that there could be other issues in this case			2
@entity24 said someone from the hospital called sunday about scheduling another appointment			2
" we never said anything about @entity36 , " he said			0
" some of the people ranting about @entity40 , we have n't said one bad thing			0
we want things to be fixed			0
" there are no national guidelines over transplants involving mentally disabled patients			1
the @entity165 , the private , nonprofit organization that manages the nation 's organ transplant system , does not have rules about what to do in cases of patients with mental disabilities			1
doctors can refuse to consider a patient for an organ transplant if there is another illness or complications such as a severe infection or cancer that is likely to limit the life span			2
mental disabilities should not factor into the decision making for transplants , so long as the patient has strong support from family and caregivers who would ensure that the required medications and care is given , said dr. @entity191 , the clinical ethics program director at the @entity193			1
" the mental disability should not be the reason why you should not receive a kidney , " said @entity191			2
the decision should come down to " a medical problem , not the value of the life of a mentally disabled person			1
" the issue of developmental delay is a difficult one for transplant doctors			2
" it 's such an unpredictable area ; there 's not a lot of info known , " said dr. @entity206 , the chief of pediatric transplantation at @entity208 , about various developmental disabilities			0
" therefore these decisions are usually individualized , based on the patient 's conditions , their absolute need for transplant and other aspects of the patient 's condition			1
" all transplant recipients have to take immune - suppressing medication to make sure there is no rejection of the new organ			2
" because many individuals with disabilities have a guardian or health care provider making sure they 're getting to their appointments , the compliance is not an issue , " said @entity227 , program director of @entity228 at the @entity229			0
@entity227 wrote a 2006 report examining the outcome of patients with developmental delays who received kidney transplants			1
the report published in @entity244 concluded that the one - year patient survival rate was 100 % and the three - year outcome was 90 %			0
in @entity23 's case , it 's difficult to draw any conclusions because , " all we know is what the mom reported hearing			2
we do n't know what the physician stated , " she said			0
on the flip side , patients who have mental disabilities or neurological delays can qualify to be live organ donors after undergoing screening processes and consent from the family			1
@entity24 said over the past few days , they 've heard from other parents of children with developmental disabilities , who say they were excluded from transplants			2
all kids deserve a chance , he said .			0

@entity4 mom wrote that a doctor rejected transplant based on " mental delays "
the hospital has faced much *criticism* from social media
