@entity8 has some advice for @entity7 : be careful			1
" the summit is an opportunity , but also a risk for @entity13 policy , " @entity8 said			2
" not all the neighbors there are good			0
why do we recognize this reality when we lock our doors at night but do n't recognize it in our foreign policy ?

" it will be seen as a test of real @entity13 readiness to change in the hemisphere			0
what he says about @entity55 will make headlines			1
" but @entity8 warns that the @entity13 should extract some conditions from @entity55 before making any allowances			1
" there 's a way it can be done to advance the conditions of the people in @entity55 , " he said			1
" i do n't approve of the unilateral way it 's being done			2
the embargo is a negotiating tool			0
we should not negotiate with ourselves , and that 's what we 're doing			2
" @entity22 also said @entity7 must address " the pandemic of criminal violence " destroying many parts of @entity2			1
@entity13 aid is focused primarily on @entity49 and @entity48			0
