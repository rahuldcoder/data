-- it 's called the @entity3 , and weeks before authorities say he got on a plane with a bomb , @entity1 was in it			0
the vast government databank , known as @entity3 , is administered by the @entity10 's @entity9			2
it contains information about hundreds of thousands of people , the majority of them foreign nationals , who are suspected of having terrorist leanings			0
an @entity10 official said @entity1 was included in @entity3 after his father warned the @entity20 in @entity21 of his son 's hard - line beliefs and possible ties to militant @entity25			1
to understand how he could have been under the government 's scrutiny and still make it onto a @entity32 - bound plane with an explosive , you have to understand the way the government 's watch list system works			2
@entity3 is just the start			0
the @entity10 uses the raw information contained in the @entity3 databank to determine whether to put the subject onto the government 's terror watch list , known as the @entity42			1
that list contains the names and aliases of about 400,000 people , but @entity1 did n't make the cut			0
according to @entity49 , a spokesman for the @entity10 's @entity50 , there was n't enough hard evidence to back up @entity1 's father 's fears , and so he was n't placed on the terror list			1
the bureau 's own web site spells out the criteria for inclusion in the screening database , saying that " only individuals who are known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting , in preparation for , in aid of , or related to terrorism are included			0
" the determination not to put @entity1 on the screening list had far - reaching consequences			0
in may , the @entity69 's inspector general issued a report on the watch - list process , including a flow chart describing how anyone suspected of terrorist ties passes through a series of lists , the most serious of which includes the @entity79 's no - fly list			1
making it from the @entity3 database to the @entity10 's screening list is the key			2
because @entity1 did n't make the screening database , his name could not then be sent onto the watch lists maintained by the @entity79 : the " selectee list , " which law enforcement sources say includes about 14,000 names , and the " no - fly " list , which those sources say bans some 4,000 people from boarding any commercial flight destined for the @entity32 .			1

father 's warning *prompted* man 's inclusion in @entity10 database
not enough evidence to put him on watch list , official says
suspect then could not be added to @entity79 lists
