@entity0 is easing users into ads with a first look at what the paid posts will look like			1
the photo - sharing service said the ads will begin appearing in users ' feeds in the coming week and showed examples of what ads will look like in a blog post			1
@entity0 first warned users of the impending ads three weeks ago			1
this is the first time ads have appeared in @entity0 feeds			2
the ads will look almost exactly like regular @entity0 posts , but in the top right corner a blue arrow icon and the word " sponsored " will replace the old time - stamp			1
click on the more button in the bottom right corner and there will be additional options to hide an ad or give feedback on why you did n't like it			0
the service is taking great pains to make initial ads attractive and in - line with the sepia - and sunset - soaked @entity0 brand			1
it 's handpicking the early advertisers , choosing big names that already have @entity0 accounts including @entity40 , @entity41 's , @entity42 and @entity43			0
well - funded brands will likely spring for high quality , original photos that blend in better with a regular feed of photos from friends			0
if your friends are iffy photographers , the ads might stand out for being a bit prettier than you 're used to			0
it 's a much more cautious approach than @entity0 's parent company @entity56 took with its early ads. the notoriously low - budget ads on the social network have been known to shill everything from discount clogs and dating services to big brands like @entity64 and @entity65 with dinky stock photography or logos			2
@entity0 and @entity56 already know a great deal about what you like and what ads you 'll be most interested in seeing			2
the service is going to use data from your @entity0 and @entity56 habits -- like your friends , likes and interests -- to help it choose what ads to show			0
it will also use your feedback on ads over time to flesh out your ad - dossier			0
all @entity0 users will eventually see ads , even if they do n't have a @entity56 account			2
if you 're on @entity0 , there is no way to avoid them for now , though the rollout will be limited to users in the @entity90 at first			1
@entity0 will also only show ads to people 18 and older ( anyone over 13 can open an @entity0 account ) .			0

@entity0 showed mock - *ups* of what its first ads will look like
the paid posts will be *formatted* just like regular @entity0 posts but *labeled* as sponsored
the new ads will roll out to users in the @entity90 in the coming week
