a city defined by the natural contours of the land , hugging the sea and pinpricked by rocky outcrops , @entity0 has been planned to fit around the landscape			1
this year , this mini metropolis has proven it 's creative credentials in all aspects of urban life			2
the @entity13 capital has gained hugely from a shake up in the city planning department			1
new arrangements have changed the dynamic -- such as old railway tracks being converted into a pedestrian cycling route			2
any fuss about old statues being overshadowed by contemporary architecture clearly belongs to the old order			1
below , our top four of the new architectural landmarks in the 2012 @entity27 ( @entity27 )			1
@entity28 between two of the city 's main shopping malls , and the iconic 1930 's @entity34 building , this circular wooden structure is a surprisingly bold architectural statement in one of the busiest parts of @entity0			1
designed by the studio @entity38 ( consisting of three young architects ) the awarded building is a site for meditation , its plain minimalist form inviting quiet reflection			2
made out of @entity13 timber , the design shows great sensibility for the use of local materials			1
without side windows light falls from above through an oval gap around the ceiling , creating a sense of calmness			2
the chapel demonstrates how contemporary architecture at its best can fascinate and inspire			1
it is one of the true centerpieces of the @entity27 program			1
opening hours : 7 am to 8 pm on weekdays , 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends 2			2
@entity66 the new concert venue and music academy , occupies a site between three of the city 's architectural monuments			1
on the opposite side of @entity73 stands the @entity74 in neoclassical style , to the north lies @entity78 's @entity77 from 1970s and across the lawn to the south shines @entity82 's @entity81 of @entity83 as most new buildings it has divided opinions			2
the architecture was criticized for not being bold enough , perhaps not living up to the expectations imposed by its neighboring buildings			1
however , the interior has great spatial rhythm with seven halls in different sizes , descending below the ground level			2
the largest hall follows a vineyard shape design , where musicians are surrounded by the audience and a row of windows allows daylight into the space when left uncovered			1
the program is a combination of classical and popular music			0
one of the autumn highlights has been @entity107 conducted by @entity108 and presented in collaboration with visual artist @entity110			1
world - class orchestras such as @entity112 and @entity113 have also been scheduled to perform in the main hall renowned for its exceptional acoustics			1
@entity116 13 a , @entity0 00010 3			0
@entity117 a short stroll from the @entity120 , this cafe has become one of the most popular spots along the seafront for a coffee break and for drinks on warm summer evenings			0
opened last year it also embodies the innovative attitude of the new city planning department			1
the long coastline has recently been enlivened by new cafes and industrial harbor sites are being redeveloped			0
in the smart @entity134 neighborhood , @entity117 occupies a beautiful site previously allocated for washing rugs in the seawater , hence the name " rug quay			0
" the atmosphere is relaxed and the tipple of choice seems to be bubbly , with an unusually large selection of @entity144 and @entity145 for a seaside cafe			0
tapas style snacks sandwiches and pastries are also served			0
@entity149 3 a , 00140 @entity0 4			0
@entity150 since moving into new premises last year , @entity150 has established itself as the largest gallery dealing in contemporary art in @entity155			1
despite its imposing scale , the gallery has a welcoming @entity159 feel with whitewashed wooden floors and daylight falling through the ceiling in the main hall			0
and just one block away from @entity166 department store			0
designed by @entity167 , @entity150 relied on the @entity170 based architects ' expertise with exhibition spaces , seen in earlier commissions from big @entity174 art institutions and galleries such as @entity176			0
in @entity0 , @entity167 conjured an airy gallery out of an old office block , where @entity150 will showcase some of the best in @entity13 art and design during the @entity27 year			1
@entity182 5 , 00120 @entity0 recommended by @entity183 , director of the @entity184 : the best places for a stopover in @entity0			0

@entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 39 , 00100 @entity0 " designed by @entity78 in the 1960 's this cafe is a unique place in the heart of the city			2
it is run by the same family as @entity228			0
