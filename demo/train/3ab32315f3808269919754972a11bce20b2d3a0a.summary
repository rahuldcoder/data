-- a standoff between @entity2 and thousands of unionized workers based in @entity4 came to an unexpected end friday after workers voted in favor of a contract to build the company 's new commercial jet			1
the deal keeps economic activity worth billions inside the state , and means hundreds of thousands of jobs will be retained			1
the vote friday , from the @entity16 , came in at 51 % to 49 %			1
it was a dramatic reversal in the machinists ' stance , after they had overwhelmingly rejected a similar contract less than two months ago			1
the new contract , which will run from 2016 to 2024 , means an end to the traditional pension plan for more than 33,000 machinists at @entity2 , replacing it with a 401 ( k ) type of plan			1
the plan had been a sticking point , but fear of losing jobs and work connected to the jet prompted members to change their minds			2
@entity36 representatives told media they did n't like the position , but were forced to accept it			0
local union officials had pointed to the loss of the pension as the prime reason to reject the deal , also arguing that approving the contract would encourage the company to make continued threats to move work elsewhere in the future in order to win other concessions			1
however , @entity51 international leadership had argued the new offer was better than one that was rejected last year , adding about $ 1 billion in value to members			0
the improvements include an additional $ 5,000 bonus in 2020 and the continuation of the current formula for how new hires move up the pay scale			0
@entity62 , speaking on behalf of the local union president , @entity63 , said , " our members have spoken , and having said that , this is the course we 'll take			2
no member liked this or the position we were put in by the company			0
" " we faced tremendous pressure from every source imaginable , " @entity62 said			0
" politicians , the media , and others , who truly had no right to get into our business , who were aligned against us			0
" @entity79 , chief executive officer of @entity80 , said in a statement that the @entity82 and the composite wings would now be built in the @entity85 area , where the company 's plants are based			2
" thanks to this vote by our employees , the future of @entity2 in the @entity89 has never looked brighter , " he said			2
the @entity82 is @entity2 's answer to the @entity95 , which competes with @entity2 's current 777 classic series of jet airliners			1
the @entity98 is assembled at @entity2 's production plant in @entity100 , @entity101 , near @entity102			1
the @entity98 's metal wings are built in @entity104 , shipped to @entity100 and joined to the fuselage at the @entity2 plant			2
production of the @entity82 will begin in 2016 , with a first flight due in 2018 before it goes into service in 2020			0
the jet will use carbon - composite wings , which are regarded as the plum of the program			0
state officials had pulled out all the stops to win the program			0
gov. @entity117 said losing the @entity118 to another state would be the beginning of the end of @entity2 's production in @entity4 , where the company employs nearly 90,000 and drives another 270,000 indirect jobs			1
elected officials and others believed that losing the @entity82 and the composite wings would mean future airplanes would follow the @entity118 to other states .			0
