-- according to the " @entity2 , " @entity1 is the most popular role in the movies			1
so if @entity5 hardly seems like the iconic @entity1 ( he 's too short and muscular , and strains to suggest the intellectual arrogance that comes so easily to the @entity7 ) , he can take his place alongside such oddball castings as @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
and he 's ideally suited to director @entity14 's purpose , which is not to dust off your grandfather 's @entity15 , but to juice today 's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth			2
what 's fun about these movies is that the equation works both ways			2
yes , this @entity1 is more likely to get physical than his predecessors , he 's even a bit of a boor , but he 's still a more cerebral action hero than we find in most blockbusters , and the period trappings ( a seamless blend of @entity32 and location work ) help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations			1
@entity14 and husband - and - wife screenwriters @entity38 and @entity39 ( " @entity40 " ) map out a fast - moving -- if ridiculously digressive -- @entity42 adventure that crisscrosses @entity43 by horseless carriage , train , boat , and , in @entity1 's case , pony			1
just down the road from 221 @entity50 they 're digging a tunnel for what will become the @entity53			0
the @entity54 is beginning to stretch its muscles , while a series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great @entity43 powers			0
@entity1 detects something other than social unrest behind the bombings : an evil master plan leading inexorably to his nemesis , @entity64 ( @entity65 )			1
there are big themes there , but the movie does n't take itself remotely seriously			2
this is a rambunctious romp , even brazenly camp when it 's poking fun at the always - intriguing @entity75 relationship			2
sometimes it seems like the real motivation behind @entity64 's scheme is not to plunge @entity43 into war so much as to prevent the doctor from consummating his marriage and reunite him with his former roommate , which is where he rightfully belongs			0
nothing if not versatile , @entity5 dons myriad disguises through the course of the movie ( he even impersonates a bookcase ) , and he does a long , very funny turn in drag			1
@entity92 is hardy to his @entity93 , always piqued , but somehow affectionate in his aggravation			1
and @entity14 has the good instincts to let their byplay run the show			0
they make such a splendid comic double - act , there 's not much more than a look - in for the fairer sex			0
@entity1 's main squeeze , @entity105 ' @entity104 , scarcely makes it to the opening titles			1
@entity75 's intended , @entity108 , fares a little better , but her most memorable scene comes when the great detective rudely shoves her out of a moving train			0
as for @entity113 , the original " girl with a @entity114 , " at least she comes along for the ride as a gypsy soothsayer with anarchist tendencies , but the screenwriters ' appear to forget about her existence whenever things start to get exciting			0
the movie has more than its share of good gags , and if @entity14 's tic - y histrionics with the camera are starting to flag ( i think we 've seen the pre-rehearsed fisticuffs more than enough now , thanks ) , he 's a dab hand in the editing suite			1
playful and polished , " @entity136 " is at least as much fun as its predecessor			0
" who taught you to dance ? " asks @entity1 , as he waltzes the good doctor through another deadly scrape			2
" you did , " comes the inevitable reply			0
they make a lovely couple .			0

this @entity1 is more likely to get physical than his predecessors
@entity5 dons myriad disguises through the course of the movie
