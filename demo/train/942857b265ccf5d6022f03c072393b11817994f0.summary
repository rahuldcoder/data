-- the roadblocks went up on a friday at several points in two @entity4 towns , about 40 miles on either side of @entity6			1
for the next two days , off - duty sheriff 's deputies in @entity10 , to the east , and @entity12 , to the southwest , flagged down motorists and steered them toward federal highway safety researchers			1
the researchers asked them a few questions about drinking and drug use and asked them for breath , saliva and blood samples -- offering them $ 10 for saliva and $ 50 to give blood			2
it 's not just in @entity4			1
the roadblocks are part of a national study led by the @entity28 , which is trying to determine how many drivers are on the road with drugs or alcohol in their systems			1
similar roadblocks will be erected in dozens of communities across the nation this year , according to the agency			1
it 's been going on for decades			2
previous surveys date to the 1970s			0
the last one was run in 2007 , and it included the collection of blood and saliva samples without apparent controversy , sheriff 's spokesmen in both @entity4 counties said			1
but this time , it 's happening as the @entity50 administration struggles to explain revelations that @entity53 spy organizations have been tracking phone and @entity56 traffic			1
against that backdrop , the @entity28 - backed roadblocks have led to complaints in @entity4 about an intrusive federal government			1
gov. @entity61 complained that his office had not been notified that the surveys were going to be conducted			0
speaking on a @entity6 radio show , @entity61 , a @entity65 , said the stops were " bad timing " after the @entity68 revelations and in light of recent complaints about the @entity71 subjecting conservative groups that applied for tax exemptions to additional scrutiny			0
@entity77 spokesman @entity76 said the governor 's office " is working to find out exactly what took place during those surveys			2
" " we just want to make sure the rights of our citizens are protected , " @entity76 said			2
and @entity85 , executive director of the @entity4 chapter of the @entity87 , called the use of deputies to conduct the survey an " abuse of power			1
" even though the survey is voluntary , people still feel they need to comply when asked by a police officer , she said			2
" how voluntary is it when you have a police officer in uniform flagging you down ? " @entity85 asked			0
" are you going to stop ? yes , you 're going to stop			0
" the agency said in a statement that the survey provides " critical information " to reduce drunken or drugged driving			1
" impaired driving accounts for more than 10,000 deaths per year , and findings from this survey will be used to maximize the impact of policy development , education campaigns , law enforcement efforts and other activities aimed at reducing this problem , " it said			2
the program costs about $ 7.9 million over three years , from planning the study to analyzing the results , it said			2
" the survey provides useful data about alcohol and drug use by drivers , and participation is completely voluntary and anonymous , " it said			1
" more than 60 communities across the country will participate this year , including two @entity4 counties , both of which also participated in the previous survey in 2007			1
@entity28 always works closely with state safety officials and local law enforcement to conduct these surveys as we work to better inform our efforts to reduce drunk and drugged driving			1
" the agency said the 8,000 drivers expected to take part will do so voluntarily and anonymously , and researchers follow " a highly scientific protocol and complex statistical design in order to accurately reflect the problem nationwide			1
" @entity145 rules dna swabbing after arrest is legal in the 2007 survey , about 7,700 drivers gave saliva samples and 3,300 gave blood at survey sites run during both day and night			2
among drivers who were interviewed at night , 12.4 % had alcohol in their systems , while about 16 % had used marijuana , cocaine or over-the - counter or prescription drugs			2
@entity160 , publisher of the @entity4 conservative blog @entity161 , said the complaints are mostly because of the bad timing @entity61 mentioned			1
but , he added , " i think it 's also that it has a lot to do with a larger distrust of government and people feeling more and more like their privacy has been invaded			2
" when you see that taken out of the online space , where it 's not quite as tangible , and into the real , physical world , that 's the kind of visible and tangible thing that people can latch onto , " he said			0
@entity160 said he does n't believe that the roadblocks are the result of " some sort of sinister conspiracy			0
" but , he added , " i think it 's inappropriate to have uniformed police officers on the side of the road taking people 's saliva samples , whether it 's voluntary or not			0
" the off - duty sheriff 's deputies who took part this year set up traffic signs notifying motorists that a national traffic survey was being conducted , said @entity12 sheriff 's deputy @entity198 , who worked at one of the five sites around @entity201			1
the next half - dozen drivers who came by were flagged down and asked whether they wanted to take part in the program			0
if they did , they were steered into a spot where researchers from the @entity207 , which conducted the survey for the @entity28 , began asking them questions			1
once they drove off , deputies flagged down another car to take their place			0
" it was all voluntary			0
nobody was made to participate or anything like that , " @entity198 said			0
" they could just answer the little 10 survey questions and then leave , or they could answer the questions and give the mouth sample , or they could do it all			0
" deputies were told they were not to make arrests , he said			0
if a breath sample indicated that a driver was legally intoxicated , " the organization would handle them as far as a ride home			0
" @entity198 said most motorists opted in , although several at the roadblock he worked bowed out			0
" i had mostly traffic of folks going to and from work , " he said			0
" we had several that would say , you know , ' i do n't have time ' or ' i 'm on my way to work , i ca n't			0
' " @entity198 said @entity12 had no complaints about its role in the 2007 survey			0
nor did @entity10 , said lt. @entity243 , a sheriff 's spokesman there .			1
