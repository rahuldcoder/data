-- " @entity3 " is back , and just look how much life has changed since that first show in 1982			1
yeah , we love the ' 80s , too			1
in the early years , the political debate show was all about the @entity10 , @entity12 administration , death penalty , sex education -- and bow - ties , big glasses and tweed blazers with diagonally striped ties			1
the first show on june 25 , 1982 , focused on @entity21 's resignation as secretary of state			1
" @entity23 : ' 88 comments on @entity25 , @entity27 ring true today these days , 31 years later , we 're just as diverse on the daily commentary			1
@entity27 is weighing heavily on our minds , but then we just ca n't seem to stop talking about @entity31 ' over-the - top twerking performance at the @entity32			1
culturally so much has changed			1
with " @entity3 's " return , we invited @entity0 readers to dish on life in the ' 80s			1
many readers talked about coming of age and finding themselves during that era , with a little help from heavy metal , hairspray and @entity32			1

" my favorite clothing at that time to relax in public was a pair of black pants with a white or red stripe down the sides , a double breasted white or black tunic blouse and knee - high black leather boots ; two - inch black leather belt optional			2
" " @entity3 " classic : @entity65 on dirty lyrics music defined us			1
@entity69 fell in love with heavy metal , which was under heavy fire at the time by @entity74 and those of the self - proclaimed moral majority			1
it was a topic of discussion on " crossfire " when @entity65 was a guest			2
@entity69 believed it to be an issue of free speech			2
" when you 're judged so readily , so quickly , and so harshly for so long , it 's hard not to become more empathetic			2
my tastes have n't changed and i 'll never use hairspray again			2
but my appreciation and gratitude to be able to enjoy and share the music i love freely has definitely grown			1
" music was also a unifying force			2
growing up in @entity95 , @entity94 was transcending race and making friends from all different cultures			2
" people may not like you on the outside , but they soften up when you sing them a song they can relate to , " she said			2
" i remember white kids in my neighborhood ... being amazed when they found out @entity105 was one of my all - time favorite groups and i could sing all of their songs			2
" " @entity3 " classic : @entity110 opposes @entity111 day in 1983 there was a time before business casual and dress down fridays			1
corporate attire involved scarves tied in bows , dress pants , blazers and pumps			2
@entity121 dug up this gem of the it team at @entity124 in @entity125 in 1985			0
" when i look at the photo , it all seems so formal to me			0
it was as if we were wearing a uniform , which i guess in some ways , we were			0
" we were divided on @entity12			0
@entity12 took office as president in 1981 , wrote @entity134 , and " within minutes , the @entity136 hostages were released			0
i was relieved and happy that he had been elected , having very high hopes for the next four years			0
" 1988 " @entity3 " classic : @entity140 military capabilities during that same time , @entity145 was protesting against nuclear weapons , @entity142 's involvement in @entity142 and @entity12 's economic policies , which she believed were " cruel and would hurt the poor and give the rich more wealth			1
" @entity149 voted for @entity12 the first time around , but switched parties after @entity12 fired more than 11,000 striking air traffic controllers in 1981			0
@entity149 is now a progressive @entity152 " thanks to @entity12 's ' trickle - down economics ' that never trickled down , " he said			0
at least , that 's how we remember those times , " when we were n't always so plugged in or bombarded with data , " wrote @entity159 , now 41			0
it also seemed easier to pursue your dreams , said @entity164 , who was a recently divorced mom of two boys in 1981			0
she found work as a " helicopter hooker " and later started her own helicopter company			0
" today that 's not so , most people have to take whatever comes their way , " @entity164 wrote			0
" for me , the ' 80s were great			1
even being a single parent , we managed to do ok			0
" but it was n't all sunshine and roses			0
@entity179 grew up " with the threat of global thermal nuclear war and under the specter of @entity183 , " @entity159 wrote			0
" i like to joke now that the freewheeling baby boomers , with their sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll , got to have all the fun , leaving us with " @entity190 " and songs like @entity192 ( to have a @entity193 )			0
' however , we were lucky to be witness to new wave , the early days of beatbox and hip - hop and the earliest inkling of an environmental movement			0
" " @entity3 " classic : @entity201 in 1982 and we wished @entity202 was real			1
after the @entity206 movie came out in 1982 , @entity204 's 5 - year - old daughter , @entity203 , was enthralled			1
" she thought having an @entity202 would be such a fun thing			0
she even invented a pretend @entity202 of her own and would play for hours			0
" if there was a full or almost - full moon , she would watch out the window to see if she could spot the alien			0
