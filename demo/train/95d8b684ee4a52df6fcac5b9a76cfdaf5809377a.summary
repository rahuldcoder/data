-- ' " i had such a crush on him when i was a kid , " says my friend @entity8 , pigtails peeking out from beneath her pink ski helmet rather than the wool pompom hat she wore as a kid			0
i peer into the tiny ski shop at the @entity11 and catch a glimpse of a cute guy in glasses behind the counter			1
" no idea how old he is , " she says , " but i 've seen him here every winter since i was 15			0
" @entity8 and @entity21 on the slopes twenty - two years later , and @entity8 and her teenage crush are still here ? i 've yet to even take a run down the powder white slopes , but i already sense that @entity11 , @entity26 , just might be as special as everyone says it is -- including my self - proclaimed " @entity29 " husband			1
tired of not getting an invite to his annual " guys ' trip , " and admittedly jealous about the other love in his life , i decided to tag along on @entity8 's annual father - daughter jaunt			1
and finally experience for myself this almighty @entity11 -- with just seven lifts ( and not much else ) spread across 2,200 acres of heart - pumping hikes and narrow chutes , chest - deep powder , and total lack of pretension			1
skis slung over our shoulders , we walk out the weathered wooden door of the lodge , taking in a deep breath of fresh -- albeit thin -- mountain air			0
i 'm instantly happy to be here at 10,550 feet , on leased @entity54 land at the resolutely un-corporate resort , where faded one - pieces outnumber @entity58 jackets , chairlifts seat at most four across , and five no - frills lodges , scattered up @entity61 , sleep 1,200 skiers , tops			1
@entity66 : plan your trip to @entity11 and , above all , not snowboarders			1
as the mountain motto goes , @entity11 is for skiers			1
during my stay , i see it flaunted on banners , baseball caps , bumper stickers			1
@entity78 is , after all , one of just three resorts left in the country that ban boarders , since @entity82 opened its slopes to all in march			1
geared up , @entity8 , her dad , and i creep along in a bar-less triple chair , surrounded by nothing save blue sky and the towering peaks of the @entity89			0
" same as it was in the ' 60s , " says @entity90 , who first came to @entity11 from @entity91 in search of what he 'd heard was the best snow in the @entity95			1
back then , lift tickets cost $ 8 , and there were only five slowly moving chairlifts , but apart from building a couple more and raising ticket prices to a reasonable $ 64 , @entity11 remains @entity11			1
" still the best snow in the @entity95			1
" a whopping 500 inches annually of light - as - a - feather powder -- and i ca n't wait to try it			2
but that will take some effort			0
without a convenient tram to @entity11 's best terrain , the limited number of skiers allowed uphill work for every turn with an almost perverse pleasure			1
as a typically lazy , play - it - safe sort of skier , i 'm intimidated			2
is this really worth it ? we hop off the @entity122 chair and onto a big " dump " ( a record - setting blessing of snow ) and join the parade of people inching their way , single file , up , up , up , and gliding precariously , over , over , over , only to climb again			1
is this really worth it ? i think to myself , sweating in the snow			2
i contemplate taking off my skis , but then i look up			0
" aw , it 's a bootpacker ! " one guy yells at another fellow who 's stomping with his skis on his shoulders rather than suffering the steep sidestep with everyone else			0
i press on , inspired by the unspoken camaraderie on the traverse toward @entity144 's @entity143 -- a wide - open bowl and depository of powder -- and the shared anticipation among strangers bound by a passion for @entity78 's almost guaranteed fresh tracks			2
still , exhausted -- okay , panting really -- i stop and watch as the hard - core hikers keep stomping ; my heart is pounding			1
i look downhill at the almost untouched powder and decide i 've had enough hiking			0
who needs the untouched stuff ? time to ski			0
after a blissful day on the slopes , the return to the @entity160 lodge is a comedown			0
the guest rooms remind me of my college dorm			0
there are shared bathrooms and a @entity168 table but no @entity169			0
still , the @entity160 , like all of @entity11 's lodges , has a 75 percent return rate			1
@entity66 : top 10 ski resorts i 'm honestly baffled , but by the end of dinner -- a slippers - acceptable , family - style affair , where a wine collector wearing turquoise sweatpants shares rare bottles he brought from home and our table swaps stories like old friend -- i start to understand			2
but , unlike most of the longtime guests , who remain fiercely loyal to " their " lodge , never venturing steps away to check out another , i 'm curious and leave @entity8 a few nights later for @entity11 's @entity195 , where things are a tad more civilized ( read : pricey )			1
now i have a television and my own bathroom , and reservations are taken for the window - walled dining room , where the next morning , i overhear a waiter bellow " welcome back ! " to guest @entity203 , who has been staying here since his bachelor days			2
he and his wife -- looking very ' 80s ( like the lodge ) in their matching rainbow - striped rugbys -- fuel up at the breakfast buffet , while their teenage daughter , @entity213 , heads out for a lesson with the same instructor she 's always had			2
meanwhile , i finish my eggs alone and realize that i miss the chaos of the @entity160 's hostel - like atmosphere			2
i slip on my skis and hop the rope tow to meet @entity8 for another day on the slopes			0
@entity78 never changes from the chatter around the lift line , it 's clear that it 's not just the powder that draws people to @entity11 -- it 's also the people themselves			1
old college buddies , moms and sons , widows who used to come with their husbands ... everyone returns without question			0
likewise , all the locals i meet say they 'd intended to come out for a season and do the ski - bum thing			2
but before they knew it , 10 , 20 , 30 years had passed -- and they 're still here			0
" @entity78 just swallows you up , " says @entity244 , @entity8 's ski shop crush , who , it turns out , is 41 and has lived here half his life			0
and so , because people never leave @entity11 , it 's only natural that they grow old here			1
not in the typical , canasta - by - the - pool way of growing old			2
rather , @entity11 is like a real - life " @entity251 , " where the mountain is the fountain of youth			1
senior passes start at age 80			0
@entity8 and i return to the @entity122 chair and ride up with an 86 - year - old couple			2
" @entity261 is only getting easier ! " the husband says , beaming			0
" free tickets ! " says his wife			0
inspired , i make a mental note to be just like them in 50 years			0
as we climb , once again , toward @entity144 's @entity143 , a father whizzes by with a tiny skier bouncing on his shoulders			0
" daddy ? are we at @entity144 's @entity143 yet ? " he hikes as far as possible , plops his daughter in knee - deep powder , and off she goes : a 4 - year - old making fresh tracks			1
i decide to hike out as far as i can			0
i want those fresh tracks , and this time i 'm willing to work for them			0
heart racing , legs aching , i reach the end of the ridge			2
i rest for a moment and then dip in			0
flying solo through feet of untouched powder , carving near - perfect turns , snow spraying like the pros , i realize that i 'm floating			1
this is why i 've come to @entity11			1
@entity66 : top 10 hotels for nature lovers later that evening , lounging around the @entity160 lobby after dinner -- with @entity292 , impromptu sing - alongs , nothing to face tomorrow but more fresh snow -- i get the feeling i 'm continuing a tradition at risk of being lost forever to the fast - paced , froufrou world beyond @entity61			1
" everything changes in your life ... so much , " reflects @entity301 , who 's been coming here every winter since 1982			0
" friends move on ... my family 's homes have come and gone ... but @entity11 , @entity78 never changes			1
