-- warning : contains strong language in an episode of the cartoon television series @entity4 -- " @entity8 " -- one of its characters , @entity7 , overhears a child with @entity11 's syndrome swearing			0
thinking that this is the best excuse ever for being able to swear and be racist without fear of punishment , @entity7 proceeds to pretend to have @entity11 's			0
but as the episode progresses what starts out as a funny joke for him soon turns into a @entity20 reversal when he ca n't actually stop saying exactly what is on his mind , leading to him involuntarily reveal that he has touched another boy 's penis and has fantasies about one of the girls at school			1

the trolls are like @entity7 -- men ( usually , but not exclusively ) using the currently chaotic and inefficiently moderated forum of @entity34 in much in the same way as @entity7 uses @entity11 's , as permission to express the forbidden thought -- " i can say whatever i want ! ... " @entity7 sings delightedly			1
" i 've got the golden ticket ! " but there has been a real sense of unhinged mania in the frenetic activity of @entity34 " trolling " in the past week , which has shown no sign of abating			1
@entity51 claims that on a bad day she can get up to 50 tweets an hour that are violent or abusive			0
while no one wants to be on the receiving end of these messages , anyone who writes " rape threats ? do n't flatter yourself			0
we 'll rape them too			0
@entity62 * @entity61 ! @entity65 * * @entity64 ! " or ridiculous and faintly surreal bomb threats , is certainly not winning at life			0
judging from her @entity34 feed , for @entity69 it 's turned into a full time job , lobbing all those comments back to where they came , reporting and blocking people who only pop up again somewhere else like a maddening whack - a - mole			1
but this is unsustainable in the long term and the people who are engaging in this kind of behavior are certainly getting off on the attention			0
as one might expect the general " troll " profile in this instance is immature or disenfranchised men with a misogynist agenda			1
@entity69 deserves a medal for taking them on , and especially for exposing the " do n't feed the trolls " line which has been a convenient way of allowing their hate speak to thrive			1
but there is more than just a " report abuse " function needed to stop this from happening			0
the sustained nature of these attacks is frightening as is the way in which @entity34 has responded			2
yes , it 's a matter for the police , but there are simply too many of them to arrest everyone and the abusers know this			0

first in tolerating it under the fig leaf of freedom of speech ( since when has threatening someone with rape or violence been expressing an opinion ? ) , and then by treating the matter with a diffidence only possible in the @entity123 environment of @entity124			0
that it 's taken them so long to respond is indicative of their inability to grasp the seriousness of the situation			1
but the problem for @entity34 is that these people are in danger of turning the platform into the equivalent of a manky , crime ridden shopping center -- full of sketchy types , obscene graffiti and broken street furniture -- and who wants to have a conversation there ? the platform technologists have a responsibility to provide a solution , and to start acting like the publishers that they patently are			2
they have responded , as any company getting bad pr must , but whether this will actually change the atmosphere on @entity34 -- as well as misogyny there are serious issues with anti-semitism and racism too -- remains to be seen			2
read more : @entity34 updates abuse rules after @entity162 backlash there is also the sense that this is a backlash against a series of high profile social media - driven campaigns -- not just @entity69 's banknote campaign , but the campaign to tone down lads ' mags , to get rid of @entity172 ( please , not soon enough ) , and to do something about the freely available violent pornography on the internet			1
the so - called " trolls " themselves evidently think they are being in some way edgy or humorous -- the kids who never grew out of making fart jokes -- but much like @entity7 , given license to say anything , they end up revealing much more about themselves than they ever meant to			0
in their unhinged attempts at " humor " they also expose the discourse of a violent , knee - jerk misogyny abroad in our wider pornified culture , which brings to mind @entity191 's famous statement " women have very little idea how much men hate them			1
" well -- thanks to the access to the collective unconscious that is @entity34 -- we do now			2
there is even a suggestion that some of these men are operating in a systematic group way much like online pedophiles , and how long before they act out on one of their hateful fantasies ? the more uncomfortable question to answer is why , and what can be done about it			0
while women wait for @entity34 to sort itself out , troll - shaming seems like a good place to start as @entity211 proved recently when she retweeted abuse saying : " sorry about that nasty retweet			1
but i 'm not going to be terrorized			0
" the @entity215 reported that another @entity34 user then offered to send @entity211 the address of the troll 's mother -- at which point the troll apologized			1
we also need to galvanize the men who do n't hate women -- as i 've always thought @entity191 's comment was missing the word " some " -- guys , we need your help here too			1
maybe someone should start a @entity34 campaign			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			0

trolls use the " chaotic " forum of @entity34 to express forbidden thought , says @entity234 .
@entity241 or disenfranchised men with a *mysogynist* agenda post abuse , she says
@entity234 says @entity34 's response shows it has not grasped the seriousness of the situation
she says trolls should be shamed and men who do n't hate women be galvanized
