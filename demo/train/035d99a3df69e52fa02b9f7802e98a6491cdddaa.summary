@entity0 -- the @entity3 received a classified document on thursday that seeks to justify the administration 's policy of targeting @entity7 overseas via drone attacks , a congressional aide told @entity1			1
the document was demanded by lawmakers , mainly @entity10 concerned about secrecy in national security decisionmaking , ahead of a hearing later in the day on the nomination of @entity15 to become the next @entity17 director			1
it provides the @entity20 's legal rationale for the controversial policy of using lethal force against @entity7 citizens fighting on behalf of terrorist groups			1
the drone campaign against @entity26 and its allies has been one of @entity15 's biggest legacies in the four years he has served as president @entity31 's chief counterterrorism adviser			1
" it is critical for the committee 's oversight function to fully understand the legal basis for all intelligence and counterterrorism operations , " @entity3 chairman @entity32 said after the @entity31 administration disclosed late on wednesday that it would turn the secret information over to relevant committees			1
according to an official who spoke on condition of not being identified , @entity31 decided to turn over the legal opinion because he believes the scrutiny and debate is healthy			0
@entity47 last summer received an outline around the policy that became public this week			0
however , it was a white paper that did not carry any legal authority and did not satisfy congressional demands for detailed information			0
according to the public policy group @entity55 , at least 28 of @entity26 's leading members have been killed in drone strikes , including the @entity7 citizen @entity57 , who officials said played an operational role in @entity61			1
in a 2012 speech at the @entity63 in @entity0 , @entity15 asserted that the drone strikes are legal under a military force authorization approved by @entity47 after the 2001 @entity26 attacks on the @entity7			1
" there is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield , at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat , " @entity15 said at the time			1
on wednesday , the chairman of the @entity82 said the attack that killed @entity57 was justified			0
" this is somebody who had said that he did n't want his @entity7 citizenship anymore , " rep. @entity84 , @entity85 , told @entity89 's " @entity88			2
" he said @entity57 had officially joined @entity26 , and @entity26 had declared war on the @entity7			2
" " the legal basis of this goes back many , many years when @entity7 citizens would go and fight for foreign nations that were engaging in combat with the @entity7 , " @entity84 said			2
" so what they were saying is , once you 've made that choice , you no longer get the protections that you would			0
i mean , if you join the enemy overseas , you join the enemy overseas			0
and we 're going to fight the enemy overseas			0
" but civil libertarians and other groups have not been satisfied with the administration 's transparency or its policy			0
@entity111 , senior legislative counsel at the @entity112 , told @entity1 that senators want answers to key questions around a program that @entity15 was deeply involved in while at the @entity118			1
" the most basic details of it have been withheld , " he said			0
@entity121 also said @entity47 should grill @entity15 on his claim that the administration 's drone strikes are " conducted in full compliance with the law			1
" @entity127 says it has footage from downed @entity7 drone " furthermore , @entity47 should immediately hold public hearings with independent experts to examine the administration 's legal reasoning and ensure that the administration is following the ' rule book ' for the use of lethal force that already exists : international human rights law and , in the very narrow circumstances to which it applies , international humanitarian law , " the group said			1
moreover , @entity143 , a @entity144 expert on counterterrorism and human rights , announced plans in october to investigate @entity7 drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties			2
opinion : @entity15 , @entity31 's counterterrorist @entity31 defended it in an appearance last october on " @entity154			2
" " there are times where there are bad folks somewhere on the other side of the world , and you 've got to make a call and it 's not optimal , " he said			0
" and sometimes you 've got to make some tough calls			0
but you can do so in a way that 's consistent with international law and with @entity7 law			2
" opinion : bring drones out of the shadows			0
