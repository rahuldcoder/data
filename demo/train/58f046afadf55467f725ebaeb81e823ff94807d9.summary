new elections will probably be held on march 17 , the speaker of @entity2 's parliament said wednesday , a day after the prime minister sacked two senior members of his coalition @entity6 for criticizing government policy			1
prime minister @entity8 also called for parliament to be dissolved , a step that the @entity11 is now considering			1
lawmakers voted unanimously to dissolve parliament in a preliminary vote wednesday , according to the official @entity11 website			1
a @entity11 committee will now prepare a bill for further votes by lawmakers early next week			0
speaker @entity20 said the party heads had agreed on march 17 as the proposed election date			1
the upheaval was triggered when @entity8 ordered letters of dismissal for finance minister @entity26 and justice minister @entity27 , two members of his cabinet from rival parties , according to a statement from his office tuesday			1
" during the last few weeks and , in particular , the last few days , the ministers have intensely attacked the government that i am leading , " @entity8 said			0
" ... i will not tolerate ministers attacking the government 's policy and its head from inside the government			0
" the call for new elections means @entity2 is effectively in a state of political paralysis until march			2
@entity2 held its last election just 22 months ago			2
a poll for @entity2 's @entity45 suggested that 55 % of those surveyed were against another election being held so soon			1
polls give mixed picture @entity8 will hope that the vote enables him to form a government he can work with , including right - wing and religious parties , but there is no guarantee that he will be able to form the coalition he wants			2
@entity8 has been prime minister since 2009			1
but he 's had to rely on members of other parties -- many of them to the left of @entity60 on the political spectrum , such as the centrist parties of @entity27 and @entity26 -- to govern			2
@entity8 is also calculating that he can win a fourth term in office			0
opinion polls give a mixed picture , indicating that many people blame him for the current crisis but that at the same time , if elections were held today , his right - wing @entity60 party would increase its share of seats in the 120 - seat @entity11			0
however , people feel there is a range of problems that are not being dealt with , such as a faltering economy , recent attacks against @entity2 in @entity79 and this summer 's inconclusive war against @entity82 militants in @entity83			2
@entity8 blasts ' putsch ' @entity8 told reporters tuesday that a divided government was one of @entity2 's problems , saying there was a lot of debate , contradictions and ultimatums			1
he called out @entity27 for meeting with @entity96 president @entity95 against his advice and for criticizing building in @entity79 , which some say has exacerbated tensions with @entity101 there			0
and @entity8 lambasted @entity26 for calling @entity2 's boycott of @entity107 president @entity106 's @entity105 speech a mistake and challenging his push to label @entity2 a jewish state , which some fear will alienate the country 's significant @entity101 population			1
he also accused the ministers of being behind talks " to kick out the prime minister			2
" " in one word , they call this a putsch , " @entity8 said			0
" you can not have a government like this			0
it 's impossible to govern like this			0
" ' narrow political interests ' in a @entity128 post tuesday , @entity27 said , " the question in the election will not be who was the first to identify the threats and use them for political means , but who will deal with the threats in a responsible , level headed manner for the good of the country			0
" @entity26 's centrist @entity141 party also fired back in a statement , in which it said @entity26 told @entity8 by phone that he expected the prime minister " to act responsibly and to stop dragging the ( @entity2 military ) and our soldiers into an election for your political needs			1
" @entity141 said that " unnecessary elections ... will harm the economy and @entity2 society , all for narrow political interests and a surrender to the ultra-orthodox parties , the powerful central committee of the @entity60 and outside lobby groups			0
