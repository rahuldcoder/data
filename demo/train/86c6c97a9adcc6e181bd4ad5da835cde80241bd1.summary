-- our collective use of the word " addiction " is getting out of hand			1
what are you hooked on ? a quick @entity9 search shows the absurd range of meanings carried by one word : " addiction			1
" pain - med addiction in the @entity15 and @entity17 's presumed addictions fit the medical definition , but apparently cupcake enthusiasts suffer from a " cake tin addiction			1
" technology is an addiction magnet : people love to confess / boast about their addiction to @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity9 , and @entity28			2
others have low - tech addictions to tattoos , @entity32 , worrying , hockey , green tea , @entity35 , coffee , white chocolate , porn , @entity39 , jazz , love , and @entity42			2
this word covers everything from @entity46 's gasoline intake to a psychotherapy - soaked update of a classic excuse : " my dog has a digging addiction and buried my homework			1
" good : fashion addicts stop shopping for one year like so many words , the meaning of " addiction " has varied wildly over time , but the trajectory might surprise you			0
the common perception is that " addiction " was drug - centric at birth , before gradually spreading to broader and sillier stuff , like sex addiction and internet addiction			1
in reality , it 's gone from broad to specific to broad , taking on and shuffling off many meanings			0
addictions have always been with us , but a single , unified meaning of " addiction " is hard to score			0
good : would a laptop for every student help ? the ultimate authority on @entity77 language history , the @entity76 , shows the first variation of " addiction " popping up in the 1500s			1
the term comes from the @entity82 , and in @entity84 , being " addict " -- originally an adjective -- meant being forced by a judge to be a servant or slave , often because of debt			1
from there , " to addict " started meaning to voluntarily " bind or attach oneself to a person , party , or cause ; to devote oneself to as a servant , adherent , or disciple			1
" the meaning of " addiction " then grew to mean a zealous , disciple - like devotion			1
you can see traces of this meaning in a classic @entity106 rant to chocoholic @entity107 : " you may stray , but you 'll always return to your dark master : the cocoa bean ! " also in the 1500s , " addiction " is first found with a broader meaning of " immoderate or compulsive " dedication or devotion to something , which is exactly like our current addictions to cinnamon rolls and @entity117			1
not until the 1700s did " addiction " start to become substance - specific , and it took much longer for the @entity122 sense to take hold			2
in @entity127 , social / clinical psychologist @entity125 wrote an excellent piece on the evolution of addiction , noting that , " only in the 20th century was it narrowed and restricted to the use of narcotics , specifically heroin			0
any ' expansion ' is thus a return to addiction 's traditional meaning			0
" good : how to share your stuff with groups word maven @entity142 has more addiction history here , and a recent update to the @entity76 filled in some blanks			1
terms such as " addiction counseling " and " addiction counselor " did n't pop up till the early 1970s , perhaps because of post- 1960s drug awareness			0
we 've been talking about internet addiction almost as long as we 've been talking about the @entity153 ( or at least since 1994 )			0
though @entity154 owns the term these days , " sex addict " goes all the way back to 1927 , and the narcissistic " self - addiction " -- custom - made for the @entity9 age -- is found in 1642			1
i love the term " over-addiction , " which is traced to 1662 and seems to mean " mega-addiction			0
" these days , we might call it an addiction - pocalypse			2
with so many types and meanings of addiction , it 's always been a challenge for medical professionals to determine , as @entity125 writes in @entity127 , " just what does addiction refer to ? is it a brain disease ? a behavioral pattern ? or is it a larger experiential pattern ? " medical tomes such as the @entity180 are continually revised but @entity125 summarizes the key points for layfolk : " addiction is the search for emotional satisfaction -- for a sense of security , a sense of being loved , even a sense of control over life			0
but the gratification is temporary and illusory , and the behavior results instead in greater self - disgust , reduced psychological security , and poorer coping ability			0
that 's what all addictions have in common			0
" that 's what all illness - type addictions have in common , anyway			0
i get plenty of emotional satisfaction from my daily fix of books like the @entity76 and @entity209 's @entity208			2
my word obsession has n't raised or lowered my ability to cope , and my level of self - disgust has held steady since @entity215 grammar school			2
i guess i 'm in the safe , general range of addiction rather than the medical danger zone			0

@entity223 @entity222 : we *'d* snort the word addicted if it were possible
@entity76 : being " addict " or forced by a judge to be a servant
apparently cupcake enthusiasts suffer from a " cake tin addiction "
" sex addict " goes back to 1927 ; " self - addiction " is found in 1642 .
