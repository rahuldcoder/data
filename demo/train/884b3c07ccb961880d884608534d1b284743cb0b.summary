-- what makes a leader ? is it economic know - how , or military might ? or is it a big thinker with a bold plan ? the @entity10 election is just two months away , but there 's no reason @entity10 should be the only ones to get in on the fun			1
with that in mind , we asked viewers worldwide on our @entity19 what quality they believe is most important in a great leader			0
after tallying more than 2,000 responses from 143 countries and territories , the verdict of our extremely unscientific survey is in : nearly four out of five ( 79 % ) think a boundary - pushing visionary makes the best leader			1
vote now on @entity29 : what makes a great leader ? and despite austerity and unemployment in many countries , only one in seven ( 14 % ) see financial expertise as the top attribute for the commander - in - chief			1
those who 've hit hard times and were hoping to be caught by a social safety net will have found little sympathy from our @entity29 voters -- just one in 20 ( 5.3 % ) want to see a social welfare advocate sitting at the helm of their government			1
more : @entity29 @entity48 tool and people around the world proved that , at least in theory , the pen is indeed mightier than the sword -- less than one in 50 ( 1.7 % ) told us a military commander makes the best leader			1
a few other things jumped out at us while crunching the numbers from @entity29			2
first , men outnumbered women three - to - one in our survey			2
to put that in perspective , women cast a reported 53 % of all votes in the 2012 @entity10 mid-term election			0
more : latest updates at 2012 @entity68 which countries seemed most interested in our survey ? @entity10 cast more than a quarter ( 27 % ) of all votes -- more than five times more than second - place @entity72			1
@entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76 round out the top five			0
most of you were aged 25 - 34			0
if you were n't , it was likely you were 35 - 49			0
more : follow @ @entity81 and @ @entity82 to stay in the know so what 's your verdict on our survey ? and what would you like to vote on in the next one ? we 're hoping to publish more of these on our @entity29 page and we 'd love to hear what you think we should be asking			2
at any rate , it 's the first time we 've done a survey of this kind and we hope you enjoyed it			0
