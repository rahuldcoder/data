-- july 27 , 2011 download a @entity2 map related to today 's show : @entity4 transcript this is a @entity7			2
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity11 , @entity12 : it 's been one of the biggest stories of july : whether you saw the news on the first or the 21st of this month , chances are you 've heard something about @entity21 's debt ceiling			1
this special , summer webcast is gon na sum it up for you and explain why it 's so important			1
we 're starting right now ! first up : what is the @entity27 ? @entity28 : first things first : what is the debt ceiling , and why do we have to keep on raising it ? our chief financial correspondent @entity34 takes just over a minute to explain it			1
( begin video ) @entity34 , @entity37 : the debt ceiling is exactly the same as your credit limit on your credit cards , except it 's for everything that you borrow			1
it 's like having one super loan			2
the @entity21 is one of the few countries in the world that , by law , they have to keep on voting to increase the credit limit			1
most countries just continue to borrow more			0
so , the debt ceiling is the absolute top amount of money that the @entity21 can owe to anyone at any given time			1
and it 's about $ 14.3 trillion			2
so in order to raise that ceiling so the @entity21 can borrow more money to keep things going , the debt ceiling has to be increased by @entity62			1
this has happened many , many times before			0
it 's usually fairly routine ; this time it 's not			2
the @entity21 actually hit the credit limit on may 16 , but the treasury secretary has been able to keep the wolves at bay			1
he 's been able to move piles of money around and basically keep us solvent until august 2nd			2
if we get to august 3rd and we 've not raised the debt ceiling , somebody somewhere is n't getting paid			1
( @entity75 ) debt payments @entity77 @entity28 : and this is what we mean by that , by somebody not getting paid			2
these figures are for the month of august			0
the government will bring in about $ 172 billion , mostly from taxes			2
but to fund all of its programs , it 'll need more than $ 306 billion			2
for decades , the government has spent more money than it has taken in , which is why we have debt and why it 's so high			1
but if the government does n't raise the debt ceiling , it would not be able to spend more than it has			1
that means some government programs would n't get all the money they need to operate			1
now , these are the five goverment programs that require the most money			0
@entity103 and @entity104 give medical care to the elderly and the poor			0
@entity107 gives money to retired people			0
add defense vendors , who make military equipment , interest on investments , and money for the @entity116 , and your total comes to $ 180 billion			0
that 's just on the five costliest government programs , and it 's already more money than the goverment would have ! and if the government funded just these programs , people who work for the government would n't get paid			1
@entity21 troops -- including those in @entity129 and @entity130 -- would n't get paid			1
veterans would n't get benefits			0
your parents might not get their tax refunds from the @entity136			0
federal highways might not get maintained			0
a whole bunch of stuff would n't get done			0
now , this is a simplified example			0
it 's unlikely that the government would give just a few programs all the money they needed and let others go without anything			1
the @entity147 would probably spread a thin amount of the money it had over a lot of different areas , giving some programs maybe just enough to operate			0
but it illustrates two things			0
one : how much more the government spends than it takes in			0
and two : why many people in the government want that debt ceiling to be raised so badly , so the government can continue borrowing the money it needs to pay for all of its programs in full			1
goodbye @entity28 : things could change any minute			0
@entity62 is looking at a number of ways to raise the debt ceiling as we put this show together			1
so , check in with @entity169 every day to see if an agreement on how to do that has been reached and whether the debt ceiling has been raised			1
and i will see you again soon ! thank you for watching			0
i 'm @entity175 for @entity0 .			2
