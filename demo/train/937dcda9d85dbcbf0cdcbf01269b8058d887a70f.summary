-- scary thought -- with more than 98 million single people in the @entity4 alone , you 're simply one of many fish in the sea			2
even scarier -- after years of searching for that special someone , " @entity10 " might reject you because you 're not " @entity10 " for them			1
@entity13 relationship expert @entity12 has a new book , " how to @entity24 , " explaining how to strengthen your emotional core through four pillars -- self esteem , attitude , happiness and kindness / compassion -- in order to make sure you 're ready for that moment			1
" thanks to the internet , there 's now a new addiction ... dating , " he said			2
" it 's never been so easy to get a date			2
but with so many people to choose from , there 's always the possibility that there 's someone out there who 's ' better			2
' " @entity12 says that if you focus on improving each pillar , you 'll have a better chance of catching " @entity10 's " attention when they meet you			1
before you become , as he writes , the ex in " next			1
" the following is an edited interview with the author : @entity0 : why is it important to focus on being " @entity10 " instead of finding " @entity48 " ? @entity12 : there are loads of books around that teach you how to get a date or find " @entity10			1
" yet men and women are still searching			2
being " @entity10 " does n't ever involve being manipulative or deceitful to trap your target into a relationship			1
it 's about being a decent human being and a trustworthy , committed best friend			2
you ca n't fake that			1
the book focuses on helping men and women recognize how to be a genuinely appealing person for a long - term , happy relationship with someone else			1
@entity0 : sum up the book for us in a sentence -- how does someone become " @entity10 " ? @entity12 : by choosing to be a more appealing person on the inside , learning the skills to acquire a healthy self - esteem , a great can - do , supportive attitude , an inner happiness that 's not dependent on anyone else " completing you			1
" @entity0 : not to stereotype , but i rarely hear guys say " @entity10 " in a serious context			1
do you think many men will read the book ? @entity12 : most relationship books are written by women for women			1
in many cases they complain that men do n't " get it " about relationships			1
the only problem is they do n't invite men to be a part of the conversation			1
if you 're a woman , why not mention this topic to guys			2
ask them " what would you do to be ' @entity10 ' for someone else ? " if their eyes glaze over and they 're not at all interested in even talking about it , it could be an early indication that a long - term relationship is n't part of their agenda			1
@entity0 : of the four emotional core pillars , which is most important and why ? @entity12 : that 's a bit like asking " which muscle in your leg is the most important ? they are all important -- especially when they work together			1
improved self - esteem leads to a more appealing attitude , which helps us all become happier people			1
it 's only when you 're happy can you be a kind person			2
as i write in the book , it is impossible to be unhappy and loving at the same time			0
@entity0 : you say in the book that dates are auditions for intimacy			0
what does that mean ? @entity12 : i 've defined dates as " auditions for intimacy " because if you think about it , that 's precisely what dates are			0
when people date they assess whether they might want to be intimate with that person -- this week , month , year or for decades			0
invest time developing your emotional core			1
you 'll pass more " auditions , " which will open up far more options to you			0
you 'll be able to share the limelight with an a-list partner in a blockbuster relationship , rather than a low - budget soap opera			1
@entity0 : you speak a lot about honesty , playing games and faking it			0
what 's the bottom line there ? @entity12 : manipulation or game - playing is for desperately deceitful people who have convinced themselves that there 's a shortcut to a long relationship			1
long - lasting , happy and intimate relationships are always based on mutual honesty , respect , trust and commitment			1
@entity0 : what are the biggest complaints you hear from men about women and from women about men ? @entity12 : some men and women spend their entire lives insisting that they " see the manager			0
" it 's their default setting			0
nothing is ever right for them			0
they have a problem because invariably they have created what they think the scenario should be in their heads , then when reality fails to conform to that , they kick up a fuss about it ! as far as specifics go , it 's usually a variation on " he / she wo n't do what i want			1
" this is what i describe in the book as " first position " thinking			0
successful relationships are based on " second position " thinking and behavior			0
second position is having the capacity to experience what it would be like being that other person			0
@entity0 : throughout the book you talk about how no one else is responsible for how you 're feeling , your attitude or your love			2
why is that ? @entity12 : so many people allow their downbeat emotions to dominate their lives			0
human beings are much bigger than that			0
we can consciously decide how happy we are going to be			0
it 's a decision -- give it a go			0
someone who learns to think like that becomes more appealing to others ... and themselves			0
@entity0 : once you 've found " @entity10 , " how do you keep them ? @entity12 : a flippant answer would be -- you do n't			1
they decide to keep you			0
in order to be someone a partner would choose to keep , you need to build up , over a long period of time , proof that you are dependable , considerate , reliable , supportive , kind and loving			0
this happens as a direct result of developing your emotional core			1
it 's just like a career			0
some people take their careers seriously , others do n't			2
those who want a successful career work towards acquiring the necessary skills to be the best they can be			0
they prepare for their interviews ( or auditions ! ) and work hard			0
those who ca n't be bothered do n't get the best jobs , are forced to accept poor pay , and if over time they shirk their responsibilities , they usually get fired			2
a successful , long - term relationship requires effort from both parties			1
@entity0 : why is there a goldfish on the cover of your book ? @entity12 : whenever you break up with someone , invariably a well - meaning friend will say " cheer up , there are plenty more fish in the sea			2
" that may be the case , but you want to be the only one fish ! so many female friends tried insisting that the cover had an image of a swan or a pair of love birds because they all mate for life			0
but no guy is ever going to read a book on the subway with love birds on the cover ! it therefore had to be something that was gender neutral .			0
