-- curiouser and curiouser ! a cat 's head floats across the stage			1
a white snake orbits it , buoyed and silently guided by a troupe of dancers hidden in darkness of black cloth			2
the cheshire cat 's head is joined on stage by its paws and body and the snake is revealed as its tail			2
the animal marches , @entity19 - dragon like , up and down the wide stage of the @entity21			2
breaking decades of tradition , the @entity22 has been running a full - length commission of " @entity25 " since 2011 , replacing the @entity26 as the mainstay of @entity30 's @entity29 dance season			1
theater designer @entity31 goes beyond faithfully rendering @entity33 's original story into dance scenes , but uses plenty of his own smoke and mirrors -- sometimes literally -- to create breathtaking stage craft			0
curtains on strings and projected light conjure the illusion of @entity25 collapsing and expanding in height ; huge paper boats float over a sea of draped dancers ; enormous towers of cards are erected and collapsed ; and the myriad hidden horrors behind the innocuous looking home sweet home are revealed with brio			1
@entity53 's choreography left children and adults alike stunned on saturday 's opening night , the first of a sell out run that rolls through to january , all the more impressive when you consider he had to silently communicate a book so replete with puns , riddles and invented words			1
the purple - dressed protagonist skittishly twirls through a waltz of dancing flowers as two lines of dancers emerge from the back of the all gold and velvet hall , donning gigantic colorful meringue hats and bounding down the aisles			0
ensconced within home sweet home a scene of complete mayhem emerges : a fiery butcher 's shop staffed with malevolence			0
@entity25 dances around the mad proprietor 's bloodied cleaver , snipping strings of sausages and escaping into the lush green countryside within an inch of her life			1
@entity88 as @entity89 stole the show , most of which she spent being pushed around in a heart - shaped cherry - red carriage by a squad of red cavaliers , reprimanding her minions and sowing chaos wherever she went			0
once off her wheels , she was repeatedly disturbed from her graceful dance by the clumsy mistakes of a group of dancing fools			0
she pushes one over , threatens another with decapitation before dancing flat onto her back , legs akimbo in a huge swirl of red tutu			0
alas , you may have to wait till next year but there is real magic within the walls of @entity21 at @entity112 in @entity30			0
@entity25 runs until january 16 , 2015 at @entity21 , @entity30			1
it will be broadcast to select cinemas worldwide on december 16 , 2014			0
@entity114 2014 won by @entity116 film artist @entity115 @entity118 's most impressive metro stations @entity120 's cool new passport has a stylish secret			1
