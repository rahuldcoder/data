@entity0 -- @entity4 's roiling political unrest is causing the @entity5 to fine - tune a foreign policy equation that for 30 years has valued strategic partnership with president @entity8 over democratic ideals , experts said monday			1
the widespread street demonstrations demanding @entity8 's ouster have so far drawn a measured @entity5 response that advocates step - by - step reforms for pro-democracy changes while maintaining stability			1
even hawkish conservatives generally opposed to @entity18 administration policies have backed the @entity5 response , citing the overarching need to prevent an unpredictable power vacuum if @entity8 were to be quickly forced out of power			1
but one of @entity4 's leading opposition figures , @entity24 , warned monday that the @entity5 needs to " let go " of its longtime ally			1
" you need to review your policy , " @entity24 , the former head of the @entity26 , told @entity1 's " @entity30 " in an interview monday night			2
" you need to let go of @entity8			2
you should n't be behind the curve , and you need to start building confidence with the people and not with the people who are smothering the people			0
" it is one of the most complex issues facing president @entity18 , with @entity4 -- the main @entity40 ally of the @entity5 -- inexorably linked to neighboring @entity41 -- the main @entity5 ally in the @entity42 -- by a peace treaty that guarantees more than $ 1 billion a year in @entity5 military aid to @entity8 's government			1
@entity4 also provides vital logistical and intelligence assistance to the @entity5 , which has urged @entity8 for years to implement democratic reforms but always put the strategic benefits first			1
" we have to balance our ideals and also our strategic interests , " former @entity5 defense secretary @entity49 said monday on @entity1			2
" that balance might have been too far in one direction and not the other			0
" @entity54 , the @entity5 ambassador to @entity4 from 1997 - 2001 , said the administration wants to both support " an exceedingly strong ally " and promote democratic reform and more openness in " a closed authoritarian society			1
" " the @entity5 is trying to find comfortable ground in which we can argue for both without abandoning an ally and without abandoning our principles , " @entity54 said in a telephone interview			1
the unrest in @entity4 follows years of social , political and economic grievances that fueled the street protests that began last week and have since escalated			2
after ruling with an iron fist for three decades , @entity8 has given no indication of giving up power			2
demonstrators in @entity4 question why @entity18 , who championed human rights and democracy in a 2009 speech in @entity77 , is n't condemning @entity8 and applying pressure to help bring the changes they seek			1
@entity24 , who returned to his native @entity4 last week as an opposition leader last week , said @entity4 need to see that the @entity5 needs to be seen supporting their aspirations			1
" people need to see that you not only talk the talk , but walk the walk , and people need to understand and believe that you really , seriously take democracy , rule of law , freedoms seriously , " @entity24 said			2
asking " a dictator " to implement democratic reforms " is an oxymoron , frankly			0
" @entity5 secretary of state @entity94 outlined the administration 's stance in separate interviews sunday with five television networks , saying the " complex , very difficult " situation in @entity4 requires careful progress toward a peaceful transition to democracy rather than any sudden or violent change that could undermine the aspirations of the protesters			1
" there 's no easy answer , " @entity106 said on @entity1 's " @entity107			0
" and , clearly , increasing chaos or even violence in the streets , prison breaks , which we 've had reports about -- that is not the way to go			0
" we want to see this peaceful uprising on the part of the @entity4 people to demand their rights to be responded to in a very clear , unambiguous way by the government , and then a process of national dialogue that will lead to the changes that the @entity4 people seek and that they deserve , " she said			2
on monday , @entity131 press secretary @entity130 said @entity4 's government should engage in " meaningful negotiations with a broad section of civil society , including opposition groups , " and hold " free and fair elections " in september			2
the transition called for by @entity106 " means change , and what we 've advocated from the very beginning is that the way @entity4 looks and operates must change , " @entity130 told reporters			0
at the same time , he said it is not the place of the @entity5 to support or oppose the possible ouster of @entity8			1
allies concurred , with @entity148 foreign minister @entity147 calling monday for future " free and fair elections " in @entity4			0
" we are also interested in a stable situation in the @entity42 because , of course , @entity4 is a key player for the whole region , " @entity147 said			0
even administration critics such as conservative @entity156 senator @entity156 of @entity157 have backed the @entity5 response so far			1
" i hope we all understand how important @entity4 is as an ally , as a center of culture , " @entity156 said sunday on @entity1 , later adding that " what we need to do now is to lay out a plan for @entity8 to lift the state of emergency , announce that elections -- free and fair -- will be held in september , which were already planned , allow an open and free democratic process -- which i think we could have some confidence ( in ) if it was an open process that you would see a free and fair election -- and that we make sure that the aspirations of the @entity4 people are realized finally			1
" but some @entity5 politicians disagreed			0
@entity173 senator @entity172 of @entity174 said that " @entity8 will have to go -- but not without an exit strategy that prevents the government from falling and leaving the door open for extremists			0
" the next presidential election in @entity4 is scheduled for september of this year , @entity172 said			0
" right now , there are no term limits in @entity4 's @entity182 restricting @entity8 from running for re-election for the sixth time			1
@entity8 must immediately open these elections to international observers and give his written assurance that his name wo n't appear as a contender			0
i believe this could help quell the protests			0
" and @entity156 's @entity194 colleague from @entity157 , senator @entity195 , sharply criticized the @entity18 administration for not promoting democracy as strongly as his predecessor			0
" we might be in a better position if we had more closely followed president @entity204 's prescription for support of greater democracy in all parts of the world , " @entity195 said as he stepped off the @entity200 floor monday			0
" if we had maintained that position and had that reputation in the world ... then our calls today for restraint would have more credibility because the people of @entity4 would know our heart was with their desire for greater representation			0
" to @entity220 , director of the @entity42 program at the @entity223 , the @entity5 position amounts to fence - sitting			0
the unrest in @entity4 showed that the @entity5 policy of backing @entity8 despite his poor record on political and human rights has failed to bring desired stability , @entity224 said in a telephone interview			1
instead of what she labeled " subtle " language such as endorsing an orderly transition , the @entity5 should call for a government of national unity to take over until fully democratic elections for both the presidency and the parliament , she said .			2
