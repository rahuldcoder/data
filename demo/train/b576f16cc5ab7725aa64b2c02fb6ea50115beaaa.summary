-- @entity1 has made a clean break from @entity3			1
or at least we assume it was clean , since @entity1 's final " @entity7 " episode tuesday included one of her infamous celebrity - accompanied shower scenes			1
over the past seven years of " @entity7 " on the @entity3 , host @entity1 has roped two other stars -- friend @entity12 and fellow late night host @entity13 -- into having nude shower fights with her			1
the running gag was brought to a close on tuesday as an indignant @entity19 climbed into @entity1 's roomy shower set , fully clothed but wearing a shower cap , demanding answers as to why @entity1 never had her on the show			1
" is it because i 'm a lesbian ? " @entity19 asked @entity1 , who , per usual , was stark naked			1
" no ! " @entity1 responded			2
" i did n't even know you were a lesbian			0
i thought you were married to @entity28			0
" you did n't think @entity1 would say goodbye to @entity3 without landing another joke against the network 's patron saint of celebrity news , did you ? what we 'll miss about ' @entity7 ' throughout " @entity7 's " eight - season run , @entity1 has commandeered an unabashedly salty late night show , which on a typical night included a ring of celebrity trash - talking comedians and a celebrity interview that ran more bawdy than promotional			1
those irritated by the @entity43 and @entity44 of the world likely found a kindred spirit in @entity1 , who was n't ashamed to have open contempt for some of her show 's topics			2
( one of the rumored reasons for @entity1 's exit was that she just did n't want to talk about @entity54 anymore			0
) it 's no surprise that neither the pop star nor @entity3 's first family participated in @entity1 's farewell show tuesday , but there was n't a shortage of celebrity guests			1
@entity1 is known to run with a powerful crew that includes a-list actress @entity63			0
on tuesday , the former " friends " star joined @entity12 and @entity65 for a mock intervention ( sit through it until the end ; the surprise guest is worth it ) , and @entity70 also showed up to perform a cover of @entity72 's " @entity73			0
" several more famous faces arrived to help sing @entity1 off the network , from @entity76 and @entity77 , to @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			0
@entity77 , who accidentally called " @entity82 " the " @entity83 " at the @entity84 on monday , poked fun at her mistake by introducing @entity1 as her " good friend , @entity87			0
" " goodbye to @entity3 , it 's time to move on , " the stars sang in unison before instructing in classic @entity1 fashion , " so roll yourself a joint , and have a drink			1
" on a more serious note , @entity1 did make some final remarks			2
" i want to thank every single person who 's shown up for me in the last seven years , " @entity1 said			0
" i never really got a good chance to be serious and say thank you , and i want you to know that i am grateful for this career			0
" @entity1 is moving on to @entity100 from @entity3 , where she 's expected to produce some comedy specials and deliver a new talk show in early 2016			1
" thank you to my family , and mom i hope you 're watching me , " @entity1 said in her goodbye speech			2
" i 'll see you on @entity100 ! "			0
