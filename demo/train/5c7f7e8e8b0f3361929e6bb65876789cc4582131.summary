-- this weekend , @entity2 women will once again defy their nation 's long - standing driving ban and get behind the wheel , facing harassment , intimidation and arrest			1
on saturday , the " @entity10 " campaign will renew @entity2 women 's demand to exercise their right to drive			1
in many parts of @entity2 , women are already driving and publishing online videos of themselves in the act			1
interestingly , footage has also surfaced of @entity2 men driving by and giving the thumbs - up sign to show their support			1
an informal @entity2 ban on driving became official policy in november 1990 during the @entity25			2
as female @entity28 soldiers based in @entity2 drove freely through military bases , 47 @entity2 women organized a convoy to drive the streets of @entity32 in protest against the law that restricted them			1
officials arrested them and suspended many from their jobs			2
the @entity39 , the country 's most senior religious authority , declared a fatwa , or religious edict , against women driving because driving would expose women " to temptation " and lead to " social chaos			2
" prince @entity48 , then minister of interior , issued a decree on the basis of the fatwa banning driving for women			0
the @entity39 who issued the fatwa died in 1999 , as @entity48 did in 2012 , but the ban has remained			0
when @entity53 came to power in 2005 , he said he believed that , " the day will come when women drive			2
" that day might have arrived			0
@entity2 issues warning to women drivers , protesters @entity2 women launched the online " @entity10 " campaign in 2011 , perhaps inspired by women in @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 who stood shoulder to shoulder with men during uprisings to overthrow dictators and fight for freedom			1
they declared that starting on june 17 , 2011 , women with international drivers ' licenses should take to the roads			0
scores drove , and many were stopped by traffic police			0
their male guardians were forced to sign pledges that they would not allow the women to drive again			2
one woman was sentenced to 10 lashes ; later an appeals court overturned her sentence			0
recently , @entity2 has made several small advances in women 's rights			1
women can stand as candidates and vote in municipal elections , next due in 2015			0
they can work in various sectors without approval from their male guardians			0
the king has appointed 30 women to the @entity94 , his 150 - member senior advisory body			2
@entity2 has also recently passed a law criminalizing domestic violence			0
despite these advances , @entity2 women continue to face profound discrimination			1
the guardianship system still treats them as legal minors who can not conduct official government business , travel abroad , marry , pursue higher education or undergo certain medical procedures without permission from their male guardians -- a husband , father , brother or even a young son			0
two leading women 's rights activists , @entity111 and @entity112 , who have also fought the driving ban , face imprisonment for trying to help a woman who said that her husband had locked her and her children in their home without food or water			1
@entity2 blogger detained , but hopeful about campaign allowing women to drive the ban on driving may not be the most limiting form of discrimination for some @entity2 women , yet it has become symbolic of a much deeper oppression that touches all aspects of women 's lives in the kingdom : it has become for @entity2 women what a bus seat was to @entity136 and other african - americans in the 1950s			1
to explain why women can not drive , @entity2 authorities often use the excuse that " society is not ready			1
" yet on occasion , @entity53 has chosen to ignore such arguments and sidestep the religious establishment			0
he opened the @entity145 in 2009 as the first mixed - gender university in the kingdom			0
then he fired a cleric on the @entity149 , the highest state body for the interpretation of @entity153 law , when the man spoke out against the mixing of men and women at the university			0
recently , a cleric presented a new excuse to prohibit driving for women : he asserted that " driving affects women 's ovaries			1
" while this absurd contention is unsubstantiated by any medical or scientific evidence , it may be significant in @entity2 discourse because it seems to separate the prohibition on driving from @entity153 law , or @entity171 , claiming women should n't drive because of health risks , rather than any religious prohibition			1
even the head of the religious police stated in september that @entity171 has no text forbidding women from driving			0
in short , the @entity2 government , having ratified the @entity180 on all forms of @entity182 , is obliged to treat women equally and not enforce a discriminatory policy			2
as @entity2 women take to the roads again , the world should join them in demanding an end to this denial of basic rights			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0
