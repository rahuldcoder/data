-- a legal chapter closes now that a federal judge has lifted an injunction on @entity8 's " show me your papers " provision of its tough immigration law , but the legal combat wo n't end and will merely take a new direction , analysts and attorneys say			1
at the same time , implementation of the law will heighten a wary relationship between police who must enforce the law and @entity19 who allege it will inevitably cause racial profiling			1
the court 's demand for evidence of such profiling is prompting @entity27 advocates to police the police and monitor arrest practices			1
the controversial provision authorizes local police , while performing other state law enforcement duties , to check on the immigration status of people they stop for another reason			1
the federal judge in @entity8 this week based her decision on a recent @entity42 @entity41 ruling upholding the provision , she said			1
undocumented immigrants face arrest as they proclaim , ' no papers , no fear ' police monitoring and a public awareness campaign have already begun in the state 's @entity27 communities , who make up most of the state 's immigrants , advocates say			2
" we 're already doing it , " said @entity56 , co-chair of the @entity57 , a civil and human rights group in @entity58 that opposes the law			0
" we formed a ' @entity61 ' -- ' @entity62 ' -- hot line			0
we 're getting so many calls now it 's unbelievable , " @entity64 said			2
in the meantime , the stage is set for continued fighting between the state and federal governments over the administration of the law , as the @entity75 reiterated this week that it will only respond to immigration enforcement requests in priority cases , such as those involving convicted criminals			2
additional legal wrangling could arise from executing @entity42 district judge @entity82 's ruling to terminate the injunction			2
both sides have 10 days to agree on the wording of the order to lift the injunction , but they may disagree on how the provision should be carried out , said @entity89 , president and general counsel of the @entity91 , or @entity91 , a party in the case that is challenging the law			2
@entity91 and co-counsels in the case have yet to decide whether to appeal the judge 's ruling , @entity94 said			0
@entity94 is expecting a long legal slog , he said			0
" there will certainly be other chapters , " @entity94 said			0
" there will definitely be additional court skirmishes before section 2b -- the show - your - papers provision -- takes effect			1
this is not a dead issue because of the possibility of appeal , " @entity94 said			0
proving racial profiling is difficult , @entity94 said			1
in a separate @entity8 case , @entity91 and the @entity113 of @entity8 are now waiting for a federal judge 's ruling after a trial of their class - action lawsuit against the @entity121 sheriff @entity120 and his department , both of whom are accused of racial profiling and discrimination against @entity19			1
immigration lawsuit revives @entity130 debate " what @entity120 is doing sort of previews what will likely happen statewide if the show - your - papers provision is implemented , " @entity94 said			1
meanwhile , the number of federal immigration checks sought by local @entity8 police continues to show an overall downward trend as it has for the past three years , said spokeswoman @entity140 of the @entity141 in @entity142			1
@entity141 responds only to local police calls deemed in line with federal priorities , which are cases involving criminal aliens , threats to public safety , recent border crossers and illegal immigrants who have entered the country a second time , @entity140 said			1
in june , 61 calls from local police agencies resulted in the arrest of 151 people on immigration violations ; there were 35 calls and 86 arrests in july and 41 calls and 65 arrests in august , @entity140 said			1
" we are seeing a continued downward trend in numbers , " @entity140 said			1
" this is consistent across the board over the past three years			0
our drop house encounters in @entity142 are down considerably , and @entity169 apprehensionsâ € ” a key indicator of illegal immigrationâ € ” have decreased significantly as well			0
" once the injunction is officially lifted , the government of @entity8 will have to decide when to begin enforcing the provision , said @entity175 , a senior fellow at the @entity176 , a nonpartisan think tank in @entity177			1
@entity8 could choose to wait a period before implementing the provision to provide training or other guidance to its law enforcement , she said			2
barring a call by opponents for an emergency ruling to maintain the injunction , it is just a matter of time before it goes into effect			0
once it does , @entity175 said , the strategy used by opponents of the law is expected to change			0
from the moment it begins to be enforced , opponents will be focused on monitoring its implementation , she said			0
that 's where the next challenge is expected to come			0
in short , what @entity203 's ruling said was that , given the @entity41 ruling , the provision can not be blocked on the speculation that it is discriminatory			2
there has to be evidence of racial profiling for the law to be blocked			1
" you ca n't do it in the abstract			0
you need a person , or persons , who believe they have been discriminated against , " @entity175 said			0
judge weighs @entity8 immigration law but those kinds of cases are n't easy to win , said @entity223 , director of immigration policy at the @entity224 , a liberal public policy think tank			1
trying to prove racial profiling in court can turn into a he - said , she - said affair between alleged victims and police , he said			1
" there 's a story to tell , and a counternarrative that police officers will tell , " @entity223 said			0
" it 's not impossible , but i think any litigator will tell you it is a steep hill to climb			0
" implementation of the " show me your papers " provision will set off a potential multi-year process of litigators and activists collecting evidence to convince a court that systemic racial profiling exists			1
after this week 's ruling , @entity8 gov. @entity251 denied the law would discriminate			2
" as i have said consistently , it is not enough that this law be enforced			0
it must be enforced efficiently , effectively and in harmony with the @entity257 and civil rights			0
i have no doubt @entity8 's law enforcement officers are up for the task ahead , " she said			1
the law that supporters envisioned , however , may not produce the results they wanted , even in enforcement			0
the @entity268 administration has a policy to remove only certain groups of undocumented immigrants , such as convicted criminals			0
even if @entity8 police requests overwhelm @entity141 , the agency will not respond unless the subject meets its criteria , said @entity140			1
" as we 've previously emphasized , @entity75 officials in @entity8 have been directed not to respond to requests from state and local police officers for assistance in enforcing immigration laws unless the individual or individuals in question meet @entity75 ' enforcement priorities , " she said			2
the department will continue to verify a person 's immigration status upon request , however			2
driver 's license rules fuel new immigration debate			0
