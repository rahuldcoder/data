-- should unauthorized disclosures of classified information be praised or condemned ? the events of recent weeks -- and the disclosures of @entity5 in particular -- have propelled this question to the forefront of public debate			1
unfortunately , the responses have been polarized , with some hailing leakers as patriots , and others condemning them as traitors			2
some have cited the @entity15 to make the case that @entity5 was justified in revealing secrets			1
as is often the case , the truth is more complicated			2
the first thing to bear in mind is that employees such as @entity5 volunteer to be entrusted with classified information			1
when they disclose secrets , they are violating the trust that they have asked to be placed in themselves			2
and they are public employees ( even if they happen to be contractors rather than permanent employees )			2
the @entity32 : a glance at opinions about the @entity36 leaker this means that when they disclose secrets , they are disobeying not only their supervisors , but also the public , whose representatives have enacted laws and regulations relating to the handling of classified information			2
finally , it is not personal secrets that these employees are revealing but state secrets			2
as such , their actions endanger their fellow citizens when they undermine security operations			2
in sum , when a government employee makes an unauthorized disclosure he is violating trust , disobeying the law and potentially endangering others			2
these are points worth absorbing before cheering on leakers and whistle - blowers as " patriots			2
" this does not mean that an employee can never be justified in making an unauthorized disclosure			0
an employee could uncover activity so heinous that he feels confident that citizens and overseers would want to know about it so that they could punish the wrongdoers			0
this could be activity that is obviously criminal or clearly immoral			0
an example would be the inhumane practices employed at @entity79 prison , whose disclosure led to the prosecution of wrongdoers rather than the complainant			0
the recent disclosures do not meet this standard though -- @entity5 does not claim to have exposed criminal activity			1
well , has he uncovered activity that is clearly seen as immoral by his fellow citizens ? this is questionable since polls suggest that at least half the country favors secret electronic surveillance and disapproves of his actions			0
is it enough that @entity5 thinks that the @entity36 's program is morally wrong ? this argument is obviously problematic			1
for if @entity5 is allowed to break the law whenever he likes , then why should n't others ? should we allow a fiscal conservative in the military to reveal a nuclear weapons programs he deems too expensive ? should a @entity106 officer who supports @entity107 be allowed to disclose the use of a decoy @entity110 because the increased carbon emissions hurt his conscience ? what these hypotheticals make clear is that when officials break the law they must be able to give reasons why we the public would want the secret exposed , not why they would want the secret exposed			1
perhaps it will be argued that @entity5 thought the program violated the @entity124			1
it is worth asking : what happens when an employee becomes aware of a secret policy or operation whose lawfulness might be unclear to him , perhaps because the law is vague or because he worries that overseers are unaware of the activity in question ? under these circumstances , the employee would be justified in bringing his concern to the attention of higher - ups			1
should he fear retaliation , he might even be justified in approaching law enforcement or even lawmakers			0
but once he knows that lawmakers and federal judges have also consented to the secret activity in question ( as in the @entity150 case ) , then the employee 's options are considerably narrower			0
if the policy or operation violates his conscience , then he ought to resign			0
but if he now decides to disclose the secret policy or operation , then he must accept the legal consequences			0
why ? because by subverting the decisions of the president , @entity159 , and the courts , the employee has undermined the authority that the people have vested in these representative institutions			0
therefore to refuse now to submit to the law , to flee overseas , as @entity5 has done , is to show contempt for democracy and the rule of law			1
if an employee believes that he has broken the law for reasons that his fellow citizens will understand , then he ought to be willing to take his chances before a jury ( as in the @entity175 case )			0
the moral limits outlined above will be rejected by those who praise unauthorized disclosures			0
they will insist that unauthorized disclosures advance democracy and @entity182 values because transparency is democratic and secrecy is un-american			1
but this argument can not be taken seriously			0
after all , there are things that the public itself may not want to know , which is why our elected representatives have enacted laws and regulations prohibiting the unauthorized disclosure of classified information			0
or are our public officials only allowed to keep secrets when unelected and unaccountable government contractors agree that they may ? if that is what we believe , then why have a president ? or hold elections ? indeed , why have a @entity203 ? just let the contractors run the show			1
opinion : @entity5 is a hero it is also worth recalling that the @entity203 was not written solely to promote transparency			1
there are other important values that must also be taken into account , such as the need for what the @entity15 called " energy " in government , i.e. , the capacity to act speedily and secretly in the national interest			2
this point is often forgotten by those advocating on behalf of employees who make unauthorized disclosures			0
" has @entity223 's notion that the bedrock of democracy rests on an informed citizenry become as ' quaint ' as the @entity227 ? " @entity228 recently asked on @entity0			1
@entity228 might be surprised to learn that in may 1784 , @entity159 overwhelmingly approved a resolution declaring all diplomatic correspondence be " considered , at all times , as under an injunction of secrecy , except as to such parts of them as @entity159 shall , by special permission , allow to be published or communicated			0
" the mover of the resolution was ... you guessed it , @entity223			1
and what about @entity242 and @entity243 's expedition , which was , as @entity246 notes in " @entity247 and @entity248 , " only one of the many covert operations undertaken by @entity223 and his successors ? proponents of transparency also love to cite @entity254 , the @entity254 , who once said that " a popular government , without popular information , or the means of acquiring it , is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy			1
" what they do n't realize is that these words come from a letter that @entity254 wrote to lt. gov. @entity265 commending @entity267 's appropriations for public education in mathematics			0
to see what @entity270 really thought about secrecy it is worth recalling the case of @entity275 , @entity276 's delegate to the @entity159 , who leaked to the @entity278 news of a friendly overture from @entity280			1
@entity275 leaked the news , which had been recorded in the @entity282 on @entity284 's request , because he believed it vindicated his stance that the @entity182 would be able to mend its war - ravaged finances by raising new loans in @entity289 , and that @entity159 therefore did not have to impose a 5 % import duty that @entity276 opposed			1
claiming to have informed his constituents of " such things as they have a right to know , " @entity275 subsequently defended his action before the @entity159 as an exercise of " the freedom of speech			0
" sound familiar ? guess how his colleagues -- our revered founders -- reacted			0
@entity275 's response , @entity254 observes in his " @entity301 , " provoked " universal indignation , " because his colleagues viewed his actions as having betrayed the @entity280 and presented the public with a distorted picture of the @entity182 ' financial dealings that could not be corrected without revealing " many delicate transactions			1
" not surprisingly , then , @entity275 's defense of his action was formally condemned -- on @entity312 's motion -- as " highly derogatory to the honor and dignity of the @entity182 in @entity159			1
" to be clear , the fact that secrecy has long been seen as being in the public interest does not give officials carte blanche to do as they like			0
secrecy needs to be balanced against important civil liberties			0
the central question is : who should do the balancing ? the reason the @entity203 entrusts the business of balancing values to the three branches is because the officials in charge are chosen by the people and are in a position to check each other , especially with respect to secret policies or operations that it would be self - defeating to make public			1
so when an individual decides to short - circuit or circumvent this careful arrangement , he must only do so when there is reason to believe that representatives from all three branches have allowed grave wrongdoing to go unchecked			1
otherwise , an unauthorized disclosure is nothing more than an effort to impose one 's own narrow political view on one 's fellow citizens			0
in such a case , it is the leaker , not state secrecy , that poses an " existential threat " to @entity182 democracy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity360 .			2

@entity360 : @entity5 took on a heavy burden when he leaked @entity182 secrets
he says @entity5 could have gone to higher - ups or resigned over policies he opposed
@entity360 : @entity5 *usurped* the role properly played by three branches of government
*framers* of @entity203 such as @entity270 , @entity223 opposed leaking of secrets , he says
