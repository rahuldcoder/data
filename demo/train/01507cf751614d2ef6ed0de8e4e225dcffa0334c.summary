-- now that @entity2 lawmakers have passed what 's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country , other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state 's footsteps or stand back			1
@entity2 's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there 's reason to suspect they 're in the @entity18 illegally			1
it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them			0
critics , including immigrant advocates and the @entity23 of @entity2 , are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling , arguing that most police officers do n't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person 's legal status			1
the bill made it through the @entity33 on monday after it was passed by the @entity34 last week			2
it 's now awaiting the signature of @entity37 gov. @entity37			2
supporters of the measure expect her to sign it			0
latino members of @entity43 are calling on @entity37 to veto it			0
@entity45 , general counsel for the @entity46 , helped draft the language of the @entity2 bill			1
the institute is the legal affiliate of the @entity51			0
on the heels of the @entity2 initiative , @entity45 said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live			1
he declined to identify the states , citing attorney - client privilege			1
" @entity2 was meant to be the leading edge , " @entity45 said			1
" if you are going to work on developing a state - based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- @entity2 is the place to do it			1
" @entity45 pointed to @entity2 's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform , noting that " what 's happening in @entity2 just did n't pop out of nowhere			1
it 's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process			2
" @entity77 state rep. @entity77 , who sponsored the legislation in @entity2 , said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent			1
state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years , according to numbers from the @entity86			0
in 2005 , 300 bills were introduced			0
the next year , that number nearly doubled , and in 2007 , more than 1,500 bills were introduced			0
another 1,305 were introduced in 2008 , and about 1,500 were considered in 2009			0
about 15 percent of those were enacted , dealing with issues such as driver 's licenses , health and education			2
@entity97 , 000 bills have been brought up so far this year			0
@entity45 cited the election year , the @entity101 leadership 's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation			2
" historically , not only in the @entity18 but in virtually all industrialized nations , when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players , " he said			1
whether @entity2 becomes the standard - bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation , said @entity117 , the program director of the @entity118			1
" certainly states will look at it , but not in a rush , " she said			2
with court challenges promised from opponents , states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it 's costly , @entity117 said			2
@entity125 , the staff attorney with the @entity23 's @entity126 , said following in @entity2 's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction			1
" although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path , i think it 's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter , that @entity2 's approach is the wrong one , " he said			1
@entity141 , a legal defender in @entity2 's @entity142 , blasted the bill as " the most dangerous precedent in this country , violating all of our due process rights			1
" " we have not seen this kind of legislation since the @entity150 laws			0
and targeting our communities , it is the single most largest attack on our communities , " she said			0
@entity77 brushed off her criticism , saying , " ' illegal ' is not a race , it 's a crime			2
" " we do not tolerate those who break into our country , just like we do n't tolerate those who break into our homes , " he said			0
@entity45 praised the legislation as " the most cost - effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem			0
" " every time you convince an illegal alien to self - deport , you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation , " he said			0
in addition to providing a model for other states , @entity45 said the legislation in @entity2 and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level			1
" the states are laboratories for democracy			0
the federal government is in gridlock , " he said			0
" we 're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the @entity185 and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way			0
