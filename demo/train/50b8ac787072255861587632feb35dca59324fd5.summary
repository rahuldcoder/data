@entity5 -- " before my mother 's ... experience , i never even looked at seniors on the street , " said @entity0			1
" they were pretty much invisible to me			0
" in 2008 , @entity0 's mother , @entity8 , was admitted into a nursing home after suffering a stroke			1
" i knew from that very first night i would have to spend a lot of time there , " she said			0
" i did n't want to leave my mother in a place where people were ignoring her			1
" four months later , @entity0 's mother passed away			1
" i was outraged that our culture does n't have a place for very old people except in nursing homes , " she said			1
" i decided that i wanted to do something about that			0
" a @entity5 native and 30 - year resident of @entity27 -- a neighborhood on @entity30 's upper west side -- @entity0 researched the senior population and how their needs were being met and found a solution in her own backyard			1
" [ a ] friend said , ' what about having some people in our neighborhood taking care of the elders who live here ? ' " borrowing on that idea , @entity0 started @entity44 in 2009 , an initiative that pairs the elderly in her neighborhood with local volunteers who assist them with their day - to - day needs			1
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity53 " sometimes it 'll be a stroll , or shopping or helping them pay their bills			1
we 're their daughters and sons helping them to manage their home life , " said @entity0 , 64			0
all the seniors and most of the volunteers live within a 24 - block area			1
volunteers range in age from 18 to 81 and include college and graduate students , doctors , lawyers and social workers			2
" i wanted to establish something to support the aging - in - place community and bring people across generations together , " @entity0 said			0
according to the @entity79 , approximately 40 million people older than 65 live alone			2
that number is expected to grow as baby boomers reach their twilight years			0
" families are living far away from their older mother [ or ] father			1
so who 's there to take care of old people ? " @entity0 said			2
older parents often do n't tell their children about their needs because they fear being a burden or being put into a nursing home			1
" this is one way a community can help provide informal care that really makes a difference in the lives of the old people , " she said			0
@entity44 is just one initiative of @entity0 's nonprofit , @entity100 , @entity100			1
in addition to its efforts to improve the quality of elder care , the group hosts an annual awards event to honor older adults and is working with educators to create high school and college courses to increase the visibility of the elderly			1
all @entity44 volunteers go through the group 's application process and orientation			1
they are advised how to interact with seniors and given wheelchair and emergency training			0
@entity0 pairs a veteran volunteer with a novice and then teams them up with a senior with similar interests			0
in addition to companionship , volunteers provide a wide range of assistance tailored to the needs of the elders , including help with home management , grocery shopping and meal preparation as well as accompanying them to doctor 's appointments			1
for 96 - year - old @entity141 , @entity0 's group not only helps her face the challenges of living independently , it also provides her with hope			2
in the past year , @entity141 has fallen twice			0
the second fall left her bedridden and depressed until a friend introduced her to @entity147			0
" when i first met @entity141 she spent her days thinking about how her casket would look , " @entity0 said			0
" we got her a whole team of doctors , and now she has six to seven visits from @entity100 ' volunteers every week			2
she does n't talk about caskets anymore			0
" about 50 volunteers are tending to the needs of 27 elders			1
@entity0 believes that by limiting its reach , the group can maximize the feeling of community			0
that 's the case for 24 - year - old volunteer @entity164			2
" it 's nice , " @entity164 said			2
" it 's made me feel more connected to my own neighbors and my own neighborhood			1
" still an active volunteer herself , @entity0 said her neighbors have turned into family			0
she said she hopes to see @entity173 pop up across the country and plans to help those who want to replicate the program			0
" some people believe that old age is a time when people stop learning , but it 's not			2
and so why not live life to the fullest to the end ? " she said			0
" that 's what i love to see			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity187 in later years ( @entity186 ) website at lifeforce - in - later - years.org and see how to help .			0
