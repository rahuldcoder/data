-- it may not be as gripping as a spy novel , but things are heating up after the latest reports of espionage by the @entity6			1
international leaders say they 're outraged and the @entity9 administration says it 's investigating			1
here are five key questions to keep in mind : 1			1
are president @entity9 's hands clean in this ? it 's not really clear			1
the @entity15 reported an internal review of @entity18 surveillance programs that started this summer revealed the @entity6 had tapped the phones of about 35 world leaders and that the @entity21 ordered a halt to some of it			1
that would suggest the president did not know about the programs for the nearly five years he has been in office			0
@entity30 chairman @entity29 says neither @entity9 nor her panel knew the @entity18 was collecting communications of allied leaders , like @entity35 chancellor @entity34			1
a senior administration official separately confirms to @entity0 some details of the @entity15 report , saying the @entity21 did not know about the program until an until an internal review over the summer , after which some of it was stopped			0
targeting of @entity35 chancellor @entity34 's phone , however , did not end until quite recently , the senior official said			0
was @entity9 kept in the dark ? another @entity18 official says , however , that @entity9 was briefed and given detailed documents describing what 's known as the framework for the surveillance programs			1
one targets leaders in specific countries , which he would have been briefed about			2
it 's not known if the description mentioned @entity34 , but countries targeted would have been included			0
it 's not reasonable to expect that the president would have been involved in or necessarily briefed on decisions about individual intelligence targets , argued another senior administration official			0
rather , the president approves a set of intelligence priorities and then it 's the responsibility of his administration to determine how to carry those out			0
the explanation was backed by a former senior administration official who worked on national security for the @entity9 @entity21			1
" i really doubt he had to sign off on something like that or get into the details , " the former official said			0
what has @entity9 done about it ? that 's a key question			1
in a @entity80 op - ed published last week , @entity9 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser @entity77 conceded that recent " disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships			2
" to address them , the president has ordered a " review ( of ) our surveillance capabilities , including with our foreign partners , " she wrote			0
a report on that effort is due by the end of the year			0
as accusations mount and the issue becomes increasingly thorny diplomatically , it 's unclear what @entity9 has said and done behind closed doors			2
who 's upset about this ? the latest spying claims have roiled leaders in @entity102 and @entity103 , who have accused the @entity18 government of breaking the law , summoned @entity18 diplomats for answers and said their confidence in the @entity18 is shaken			1
in @entity35 , some leaders have suggested tabling discussions of a @entity111 free trade deal with the @entity18 in response			2
in the @entity18 , some have dismissed the foreign leaders ' criticism as political bluster , arguing that spying is a common practice in international relations , even for allies			2
what would the @entity18 hope to learn ? the @entity18 says its surveillance programs are for the purpose of foiling terrorist plots , but there are many political reasons for interest in communications of world leaders			1
for example , some media reports suggest the tapping of @entity34 's phone increased in 2010 , around the time of the financial crisis in the @entity136 , in which @entity34 was a major player			1
the @entity18 also wants as much information as possible about the actions of other states to make its own decisions about important foreign policy issues , such as @entity143 and @entity144			0
at the end of the day , allies can not automatically count on each other 's loyalty			0
former vice president @entity149 suggested in an interview with @entity0 's " @entity151 with @entity152 " that there is an interest in conducting surveillance on a country or a leader , even a clear ally			0
" we do have a fantastic intelligence capability , worldwide against all kinds of potential issues and concerns			0
we are vulnerable , as was shown on 9/11 , and you never know what you 're going to need when you need it , " said @entity149 .			2
