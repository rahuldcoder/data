-- it should be a shining light in leading football forward , but @entity4 has an " ugly " culture according to one former leading administrator			1
the game 's ruling body has been beset by a number of scandals in recent years , and most recently has been fiercely criticized for its decision to award the @entity12 to @entity13 amid allegations of worker abuse within the @entity17 state			1
" i thought it was a very difficult body to deal with -- i think its culture is very ugly , " @entity20 , who was the @entity21 's chairman from 2008 - 10 , told @entity0 in an exclusive interview on wednesday			1
as part of the failed bid to bring the 2018 @entity12 to @entity26 , @entity20 spent countless days dealing with @entity4 -- an organization which he believes needs a metaphorical clearing out of the @entity29 if it is to repair its tarnished image			1
directly in @entity20 's firing line was @entity4 president @entity32 , who at the age of 77 is in his fourth and , he claimed when re-elected in 2011 , final term of office			1
culture change " it 's made up of people who have been there for decades in some cases			1
i think the thing about old dogs not learning new tricks is true , " said @entity20 , who quit his @entity21 role under a cloud of controversy after reportedly criticizing rival @entity12 host candidates			1
" i must say that i think the hardest thing in the world is change a culture			1
you can change processes , but changing cultures is very hard			2
" @entity20 has some experience in fighting an established culture -- he was the first chairman elected outside of the @entity21 's hierarchy , having previously been a government minister			1
" i think to change a culture , then a significant amount of these people have to go			1
there has to be a fresh start			0
they wo n't like that -- they 've never liked it when it has been said , " said the 69 - year - old , who subsequently returned to politics with the @entity66			0
" you do n't change deep and unacceptable cultures by tinkering with them			0
" @entity4 offered no comment when asked by @entity0 to provide a response to @entity20 's observations			1
the @entity13 condundrum the plan to hold the @entity12 in the desert heat is now under a review in consultation with the " main stakeholders for the @entity13 2022 dates			1
" the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments is also being investigated			0
@entity85 , a former @entity86 attorney , is head of the investigative arm of @entity4 's ethics committee and will visit all of the countries involved in the process , beginning in @entity91			1
@entity85 has always insisted he is completely independent from @entity4 and would not hesitate to take action against @entity32 or other top @entity4 officials if he found evidence that they broke the rules			1
while @entity32 has confirmed there is no chance of the tournament being taken away from @entity13 , he recently admitted that it may have been a mistake to have agreed to hold it in the nation 's summer			2
" the mistake was to think that we could play this competition easily in the summertime , " he said			0
" there are some doubts as to whether it is a good period to play in this heat			0
" laughing but @entity20 is still bewildered by the decision to award the 2022 event to @entity13			1
" i 've never believed it			0
i almost fell over laughing when @entity32 announced he did n't know how hot it was in @entity13 at that time of year , " he said			1
" there are unpredictable things in life but the temperature in the @entity17 in the summer is not one of those			0
it 's one of the things you can bet your mortgage on every year			0
" i wonder whether people are genuinely that foolish -- i do n't believe they are or whether they were cynical and always knew it would have to move			0
" if it does then it will cause massive disruption , not just to the football leagues but also to the other sports which come to their peaks at the winter			0
" i think it 's going to be a very costly and difficult move to organize but if it 's in @entity13 , it 's going to be in the winter			2
" even if you could cool the players , and i 'm not 100 % sure of that , i would n't want to be a fan in the fan park in those temperatures			0
" anybody who tells me they can cool the fan park in @entity13 , which is a country i know quite well from my days in the foreign office , i 'll tell them they 're deluded			1
" @entity150 , who led the @entity4 inspection team examining the bidding countries for the @entity12 , delivered his report in october 2010			2
he concluded that @entity13 was a high - risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in december that year			2
two @entity160 members were suspended before the vote after allegations of bribery from a @entity165 newspaper , and the following year @entity20 told a @entity165 parliament committee that four @entity4 officials had asked for certain favors in exchange for their votes			1
" in june and july you can not play , " @entity150 told @entity0 wednesday , when asked about the conditions in @entity13			2
" it 's not for the players			0
the players will be ok with the cooling system but what about the fans ? " you 'll have 50,000 fans walking three , four , even six blocks or more like in @entity182 where i walked 10 blocks			0
" they will be walking in 40 degrees and it 's too much			0
one or two crucial cases will damage the entire image of the @entity12 and we must be careful			0
" entrapment @entity20 was forced to stand down from his role as chairman at the @entity21 after a case which he labeled as " entrapment " led to a newspaper article suggesting he said @entity195 could drop its bid if rival bidder @entity197 helped bribe referees at the @entity200			1
he rebutted the claim and issued a strongly - worded statement denying the allegations			0
@entity20 admitted that the @entity21 and @entity4 have endured a difficult relationship over the years			1
that relationship soured once more in 2011 when @entity20 's successor , @entity206 , called for the 208 @entity4 nations not to re-elect @entity32 unopposed -- a move which failed dismally			1
at the time @entity4 's senior vice-president @entity209 hit out at the @entity21 , claiming : " @entity26 is always complaining			1
" we always have attacks from @entity26 which are mostly lies with the support of journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth			0
this upsets and disturbs the @entity4 family			2
" to present such a project as @entity206 presented is like shooting a penalty because it can not be always from the same place that the insults and problems come from			0
" i see it at every congress			0
they have specific privileges with four countries having one vice-president			0
i do n't know what our president has said			0
" but we have seen the @entity12 go around the world , to @entity231 and @entity182 , and it looks like this country does not like it			0
" it looks like @entity26 is always complaining so please i say will you leave the @entity4 family alone , and when you speak , speak with truth			2
" no love lost while @entity20 hopes that the relationship between the two bodies has improved in the past year or two , he says there is not much love lost when it comes to his former employers and @entity32			2
" my experience is that @entity4 does not like the @entity21 , " he added			1
" the @entity21 is , for quite understandable reasons , very suspicious of @entity4			1
sometimes it is arrogant about @entity4 and that 's not good from the @entity21 's point of view , although i hope in recent years we have n't been			1
" here 's just a little example			0
whenever @entity32 used the phrase ' the @entity21 ' he would always do it with an incredible kind of sneer and usually use a funny , jokey voice			2
" he did n't believe anybody was entitled to call themselves ' the @entity21 ' even if it was the first			2
" he thought it should be called ' the @entity21 ' and did n't think we should have any sort of standing that suggested that our history was that important			2
" it may feel very trivial but it 's actually a view that we 're not entitled to our standing			0
" @entity20 was speaking at the @entity267 at the @entity268 in @entity269 , @entity91			2
the exhibition is open from october 10 , 2013 until february 23 , 2014 .			0
