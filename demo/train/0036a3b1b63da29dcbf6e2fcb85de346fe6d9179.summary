-- the evolution of drones continues			0
the @entity3 on thursday announced it successfully launched a drone from a submerged submarine			1
the technology is being pursued to give sailors additional intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance abilities			1
some of the funding for the project came from @entity13 , a program of the @entity15 that focuses on innovative and cutting - edge technologies			0
" developing disruptive technologies and quickly getting them into the hands of our sailors is what our @entity13 program is all about , " said @entity17 , acting director of innovation at @entity15			0
" this demonstration really underpins @entity15 's dedication and ability to address emerging fleet priorities			0
" your personal $ 849 underwater ' drone ' the drone , or unmanned aerial system , was launched from a torpedo tube on the @entity34 , the @entity35 said in a news release			1
the drone itself was inside a launch vehicle called the @entity40 that fit inside the torpedo tube			2
once launched , the @entity40 made its way to the ocean surface and , upon command , the drone itself launched from there , the @entity35 said			1
the drone , powered with electric fuel cells , then flew for hours , streaming live video back to @entity35 officials			2
unlike other projects that can take decades to produce results , the technology to launch a drone from a submerged submarine took just six years from concept to demonstration , the @entity35 said			1
" this six - year effort represents the best in collaboration of a @entity35 laboratory and industry to produce a technology that meets the needs of the special operations community , " said @entity57 , program developer and manager at the @entity3			2
" the creativity and resourcefulness brought to this project by a unique team of scientists and engineers represents an unprecedented paradigm shift in @entity74 ( unmanned aerial vehicle ) propulsion and launch systems			0
" @entity35 launches stealth sub			0

@entity35 *researchers* launch a drone from a submerged submarine
