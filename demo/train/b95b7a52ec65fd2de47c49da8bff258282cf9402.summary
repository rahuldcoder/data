pleading for asylum after spilling @entity5 secrets , @entity2 told @entity1 's government that he fears inhumane treatment or even death if he 's handed over to face @entity10 espionage charges , @entity1 's foreign minister said monday			1
@entity2 told @entity1 president @entity11 that it is " unlikely that i will have a fair trial or humane treatment " if handed over to @entity10 officials to stand trial , according to a letter from @entity2 read by foreign minister @entity14			1
the whereabouts of @entity2 , the computer contractor who exposed details of the @entity24 's surveillance programs , were uncertain late monday			1
he was last known to be in @entity25 , where he landed after a flight from @entity27 on sunday			1
he had been expected to board a flight to @entity32 on monday , @entity30 's semiofficial @entity29 news agency reported			2
but @entity34 journalists on two successive @entity25 - to - @entity36 flights said @entity2 did not appear to be in the cabin , while officials at the @entity30 capital 's @entity39 declined to say whether he was still there			1
@entity10 officials have yanked @entity2 's passport , but he left @entity27 on a " refugee document of passage " issued by @entity1 , according to @entity45 , founder of the anti-secrecy group @entity46 , which is aiding @entity2 's efforts to find a safe haven			1
@entity45 would say only that the former @entity24 contractor is " in a safe place and his spirits are high			2
" while @entity14 , speaking at a news conference in @entity53 , said the country has yet to decide on @entity2 's asylum request , he questioned whether it was @entity2 or the @entity10 that was acting badly in the affair			1
he called the surveillance programs revealed by @entity2 " a breach of the rights " of people around the world			2
" we have to ask , who has betrayed who ? " he said			0
@entity11 , meanwhile , took to @entity66 to address the issue			0
" rest assured that we will analyze the @entity2 case very responsibly and we will make with absolute sovereignty the decision that we believe is most appropriate , " the president tweeted			1
he added , " a big hug to everyone and happy week			0
" @entity2 has acknowledged that he leaked classified documents about @entity24 - run surveillance programs to the @entity78 newspaper in @entity79 and to the @entity80			1
the documents revealed the existence of programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity10 and monitor the internet activity of overseas residents			0
the disclosures shook the @entity10 intelligence community and raised questions about whether the @entity24 is eroding @entity5 civil liberties			2
he walked away from a six - figure job in @entity93 with the computer consulting firm @entity94 , an @entity24 contractor , and went to @entity27 before the newspapers began publishing stories based on his leak			1
he told the @entity78 that he exposed the surveillance programs because they pose a threat to democracy , but administration officials said the programs are vital to preventing terrorist attacks and are overseen by all three branches of government			0
a @entity27 paper , the @entity107 , reported tuesday that @entity2 took the job at @entity94 early this year to " collect proof " about the programs before disclosing them to reporters			1
@entity2 told the paper that he intends to release more of the documents he took from the firm			1
" if i have time to go through this information , i would like to make it available to journalists in each country to make their own assessment , independent of my bias , as to whether or not the knowledge of @entity10 network operations against their people should be published , " the newspaper quoted @entity2 as saying			2
in addition to @entity1 , @entity2 is asking @entity127 and other , unspecified countries to consider granting him asylum , @entity46 attorney @entity125 told reporters friday			1
@entity127 has not received a formal application from @entity2 , the @entity131 said monday			2
meanwhile , @entity10 officials cast a wide net seeking his return , telling @entity30 and @entity5 countries that they should hand @entity2 over should he land on their soil			2
president @entity138 told reporters monday that the @entity10 is pursuing all legal channels to bring @entity2 back			2
and @entity142 spokesman @entity141 said @entity10 officials are reaching out to numerous countries in an effort to have @entity2 turned over			0
" the @entity10 is advising these governments that mr. @entity2 is wanted on felony charges and as such should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel other than is necessary to return him here to the @entity10 , " he said			1
but @entity34 legal analyst @entity149 said the issue now " is much more of a political and diplomatic matter than it is a legal matter			0
" " in an ordinary case , sure , you need a passport to get around , " @entity149 said			0
" but here , where this case is causing increasing embarrassment for the @entity10 , governments that want the @entity10 to be embarrassed are only too happy to waive some of the technical legal rules			0
" secretary of state @entity161 particularly urged @entity30 authorities to work with the @entity10 , noting that @entity10 officials have turned over seven prisoners to @entity30 in recent years			0
" we need to cooperate on this because it 's important to the upholding of the rule of law , " he told @entity34			0
he defended the @entity10 effort to capture @entity2 for prosecution , saying " people may die as a consequence of what this man did			1
" fbi director @entity176 called his counterpart at @entity30 's @entity178 twice monday concerning @entity2 , a senior administration official said			1
and a @entity181 official told @entity34 that the @entity10 is n't planning to ask for a " red notice " calling on members of the international police agency @entity184 to take @entity2 into custody -- but the official would not say whether the @entity10 has sent or will send provisional arrest warrants to other countries that might take @entity2 in or help him in his travels			0
@entity1 ' analyzing ' request it seems unlikely that @entity32 , @entity192 or @entity1 -- the nations on @entity2 's potential itinerary -- would be inclined to send him back to the @entity10			1
the @entity10 government has already asked those three @entity5 countries to not admit @entity2 or to expel him if they do , a senior @entity138 administration official told @entity34 on sunday			0
but @entity32 and @entity192 have long had strained relations with @entity199			0
and @entity1 has given @entity45 refuge in its embassy in @entity202 for a year after he unsuccessfully fought extradition to @entity204 in @entity79 courts			1
why would @entity2 head for @entity1 ? @entity45 say he fears @entity204 , which wants him for questioning about sexual assault allegations , would transfer him to the @entity10			1
in his letter , read by @entity14 , @entity2 compared himself to pvt. @entity209 , the @entity10 soldier accused of leaking classified information through @entity46			0
he said @entity10 officials have treated @entity209 inhumanely by holding him in solitary confinement , and he predicted a similar " cruel and unusual " fate for himself if he falls into @entity10 hands			0
@entity141 questioned @entity2 's assertion that he acted in defense of democratic transparency , saying his argument " is belied by the protectors he has potentially chosen -- @entity221 , @entity30 , @entity1			1
" " his failures to criticize these regimes suggests that his true motive throughout has been to injure the national security of the @entity10 , not to advance internet freedom and free speech , " @entity141 told reporters			0
the @entity229 has criticized @entity11 's government for pushing legislation that would roll back press freedoms , calling its policies increasingly repressive			0
but @entity2 is n't looking for " political nirvana , " said @entity235 , the columnist for the @entity78 who broke @entity2 's revelations			2
" he 's searching for a place where he can be safe and remain free and participate in the debate , and @entity1 seems to be the place he has chosen , " @entity235 told @entity34 's the lead			2
@entity10 warns @entity221 @entity141 said monday that @entity27 's decision to let @entity2 leave dealt efforts to build trust between the @entity10 and @entity221 a " serious setback			1
" he declined to speculate what impact the decision could have on @entity10 - @entity221 relations , but said @entity10 officials are making their displeasure known " very directly			0
" @entity27 's semi-autonomous government said sunday it declined to act on a @entity10 request for a provisional arrest warrant because it needed more information -- and without that information , it said , it had no reason to stop @entity2 from boarding his flight to @entity25			1
@entity141 said @entity10 officials had told @entity27 authorities that @entity2 's passport had been revoked " in plenty of time to have prohibited travel			1
" " we are just not buying that this was a technical decision by a @entity27 immigration official , " @entity141 said monday			0
" this was a deliberate choice by the government to release a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant , and that decision unquestionably has a negative impact on the @entity10 - @entity221 relationship			0
" lawmakers say tenuous ties shaken further as @entity2 lands in @entity30 but an online petition calling on the @entity142 to pardon @entity2 passed the key threshold of 100,000 signatures over the weekend and had more than 110,000 early monday			0
the petition describes @entity2 as " a national hero			0
" the @entity142 says it will respond to any petition on its site that gathers more than 100,000 signatures in 30 days			0
