@entity0 , @entity1 -- a few years ago , researchers at @entity4 made a remarkable discovery : when unsuspecting diners were given self - refilling bowls , they consumed almost twice as much soup as those with normal bowls			2
in other words , it was the quantity in the bowl that determined how much they ate , not their appetite			0
while researchers are only recently discovering the power of serving sizes , manufacturers have been manipulating consumers in this way for years , from stealthily shrinking the size of yogurt containers to super-sizing sodas			0
now it 's time for the government to take advantage of the power of portion size to save lives			0
we already know we should reduce the size of many of our food products -- not to mention our waistlines -- but there 's another item that needs to go on a diet : the pack of cigarettes			1
it 's time for the 10 - cigarette pack			1
the government mandates 20 cigarettes per pack			1
but cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower and help smokers quit			1
let 's imagine that you are one of the 70 % of smokers who want to quit or cut back			0
craving a cigarette , you have no option but to buy the full pack of 20 -- leaving 19 readily available to soon entice you			1
would changing the pack size really help smokers quit ? many smokers do n't purchase cartons , because they want to limit their smoking			2
they are willing to pay a higher price per cigarette to limit availability , fearing that easy access would increase their smoking			0
now is the time to consider this move			0
@entity66 recently gave the @entity67 the jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products			1
before this congressional act , the @entity67 could regulate nicotine replacement therapies such as the patch and gum , but not the far more toxic tobacco			1
now , the @entity67 has comprehensive authority to regulate the manufacturing , marketing and sales of tobacco products			1
in fact , the @entity67 is developing new tobacco regulations ; it should consider portion size			1
most smokers actually want fewer cigarettes			1
the average number of cigarettes smoked per day declined among daily smokers from almost 19.6 in 1993 to not quite 16.8 in 2004 , according to the @entity88			2
@entity90 smokers consume even fewer cigarettes per day			1
a smaller pack can nudge smokers to smoke even less , just as buying only a pint of ice cream is safer for a dieter than buying a gallon			2
evidence suggests that those who cut back are more likely to quit			0
think about it : we could change what it means to be a pack - a - day smoker			1
the reason that we have the 20 - cigarette pack is to prevent youths from smoking by keeping the price high			1
while preventing teen smoking is critical , according to the @entity111 , only about 14 % of youths who smoke buy their own cigarettes directly from a store			0
the rest get them from family and friends			0
moreover , cigarette prices are higher than ever because of increased federal , state and even city excise taxes -- perhaps making friends and family less likely to share and teens even less likely to buy			0
we have other ways to prevent kids from picking up the habit			0
for example , under the latest @entity67 regulations , flavored cigarettes that appeal to youths are banned , as is all outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools			2
and it is still illegal to sell to people younger than 18			0
now that most smokers are trying to quit or cut back , we should allow or require smaller packs			0
if the size of the bowl can determine how much soup you eat , imagine what the size of the pack could do in determining how many cigarettes you smoke			2
it 's time to find out how much size matters			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			2

cigarette packs with fewer cigarettes could bolster willpower , @entity151 says
if you *'re* craving a cigarette , the only buying option is the full pack of 20 , she says
@entity151 : @entity67 can now regulate the manufacturing , marketing and sales of tobacco products
" think about it : we could change what it means to be a pack - a - day smoker , " she says
