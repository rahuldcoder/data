@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity5 foreign minister @entity4 's declaration that @entity5 had to prepare for the possibility of war against @entity8 over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior			1
but then @entity4 was never expected to be a soft - soaper on the diplomatic scene			0
@entity5 foreign minister @entity4 has a reputation for challenging convention and authority			1
a surprise appointment from the @entity17 ranks to @entity19 's conservative government , the founder of @entity21 has always challenged convention and authority			1
the former @entity24 secretary general @entity23 once called @entity4 ' an unguided missile ' and the man himself has been known to declare : " to change the law you sometimes have to break the law "			0
he was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in @entity5 in may 1968			1
@entity4 is a humanitarian as well as a patriot , with a strong commitment to human rights			0
unusually for a man of the @entity36 , he supported the @entity38 - led intervention in @entity39 ( while criticizing the aftermath )			2
but he did so on the grounds of @entity43 's denial of human rights , not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction			0
his and president @entity19 's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join @entity53 's @entity52 in a new push for action in @entity56			1
@entity4 did not come to his position with any of former president @entity59 's instinctive distrust of the @entity38			0
@entity60 , which has been critical of some @entity62 states for their weakness in confronting @entity64 , will have been delighted by his ' get serious ' warning to @entity64			0
but the plain - speaking @entity4 is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the @entity66 when he has criticisms to make of @entity38 policy			0
how much should be made of his words on @entity8 remains unclear at this stage			2
they were scarcely on the same scale as president @entity59 's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large - scale terrorist attack on @entity5			1
but they are all of a piece with @entity5 's new high - profile style under the presidency of @entity19			1
mr @entity4 , for example , became the first @entity5 foreign minister to visit @entity39 since 1988 , insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country 's problems , not a military one , and offering @entity5 's services as a mediator and ' honest broker ' between @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
on @entity8 he is , in a way , merely echoing the words of his president who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear - armed @entity8 would be ' unacceptable ' and describing the stand - off over its nuclear program as ' undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today '			2
certainly mr @entity4 is making clear that @entity5 no longer takes the view once expressed by president @entity59 that a nuclear - armed @entity8 might be inevitable in continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the @entity108 's resolution on @entity8 's nuclear enrichment program mr @entity4 is supplementing his president 's warnings			1
neither is saying that military intervention against @entity8 is imminent or inevitable			0
neither has yet confirmed that @entity5 would be part of any such military action			0
but both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of @entity64 's brinkmanship			0
perhaps the strongest lesson though from mr @entity4 's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in @entity5 is not a knee - jerk anti-american one -- and that @entity5 is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables			2

@entity5 @entity131 has told @entity5 to prepare for possibility of war with @entity8
was a surprise appointment to @entity19 's conservative government
also the first @entity5 foreign minister to visit @entity39 since 1988
founder of @entity21 , also @entity5 student leader in may 1968
