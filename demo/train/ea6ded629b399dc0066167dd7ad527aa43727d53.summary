-- he is merciless toward opponents , secretive to the point of being a recluse and a true believer in the cause of global jihad			2
and from his hideout somewhere in southern @entity11 , @entity8 , the emir of @entity9 , planned the most devastating terror attack in @entity13 since the @entity16 @entity15 bombing in 1998			1
@entity8 , who is also known as @entity17 , already has a price on his head			2
last year , the @entity20 authorized a reward of up to $ 7 million for information on his whereabouts			0
and saturday , his compound in the @entity11 port city of @entity27 was the target of a raid by @entity16 commandos , according to local residents			2
the @entity32 withdrew after a fierce firefight , and it was unclear whether their target -- still unidentified by @entity16 officials -- was dead or alive			0
@entity8 's vision has been to transform @entity9 from an insurgent outfit focused on @entity11 into a terrorist group capable of devastating attacks beyond its borders			1
he has already directed two -- suicide bombings against bars in @entity47 's capital @entity48 in 2010 , and september 's @entity50 siege in @entity51 , @entity13			0
in an audio statement released after the siege , @entity8 noted the attack took place " just 10 days after the anniversary date of the blessed 911 operations " and called it an " epic battle " launched to punish @entity13 for the 2011 invasion that drove @entity9 out of much of southern @entity11			1
" we tell the @entity13 public : you have entered into a war that is not yours and is serving against your national interests			0
you have voluntarily given up on your security and economy and lost many of your sons , " @entity8 said			2
he warned @entity13 that they face " a war of attrition inside your own country " unless their government pulls its remaining forces out of @entity11			0
he added that " it was also a retribution against the @entity78 states that supported the @entity13 invasion			0
" experts who track @entity9 communications say there is no reason to doubt the authenticity of the recording			0
@entity47 , meanwhile , has more than 6,000 troops in @entity11 as part of the @entity89 peacekeeping mission supporting the transitional government in @entity91			0
after the 2010 bombings , which killed more than 70 people , @entity8 warned : " what happened in @entity48 was just the beginning			0
" and with a terror resume that now spans 15 years , he has been " ruthlessly eliminating real and imagined rivals " within the group , according to a well - placed source in @entity91 with extensive knowledge of @entity9			1
" @entity8 is creating @entity9 2.0 , " the source said			1
for @entity8 , the struggle has always been a global confrontation with " disbelievers " rather than just about @entity11			1
he also vowed that his group would launch a direct attack against the @entity16			0
@entity8 is 36 years old , according to most accounts , and originally from @entity108 , now a vaguely autonomous part of northern @entity11			1
he is slim to the point of wispy , as shown on the very few photographs of him , and prefers recording audio messages to appearing in public			0
as a teenager , he studied at a @entity117 madrassa , thanks to a grant from a wealthy @entity120 , and he returned home with militant beliefs and an appetite for trouble			0
he was thought to have been involved in the abduction and murder of several foreign aid workers in @entity108 , including the killing of @entity130 aid worker @entity129 in 2003			0
among his close associates in @entity9 's early days was @entity132 , a towering force in the group and a ruthless and mercurial pro-al @entity136 hardliner			1
after @entity132 's death in may 2008 in a @entity16 strike , @entity8 asserted his leadership of @entity9 and immediately pledged allegiance to @entity142			1
according to a @entity16 diplomatic cable published by @entity144 in 2009 , he once refused to discuss a military offensive against government forces in @entity91 with @entity9 's allies until one of them apologized for remarks he had made critical of @entity142			2
but @entity142 was wary of a merger of @entity136 with @entity9			1
about a year before his death , he wrote to @entity151 that enemies would " escalate their anger and mobilize against you : this is what happened to the brothers in @entity157 or @entity158			0
" @entity142 's deputy at that time , @entity160 , took a different view			0
a letter dated december 2010 , which was recovered from @entity142 's compound in @entity164 and was thought by researchers to have been written by @entity160 , was critical of @entity142 's decision to rebuff entreaties by the @entity11 militant group			1
" i see it to be very essential for @entity136 to confirm and declare its linkage with its branches ... please reconsider your opinion not to declare the accession of the brothers of @entity11 , " the author wrote			1
in february of last year , @entity8 formally declared @entity9 an affiliate of @entity136 with a long message to @entity160 , in which he said : " we will go with you as loyal soldiers until doom and injustice disappear from @entity183			1
" @entity8 has always rejected any negotiations with @entity11 's @entity185			1
according to another @entity16 diplomatic cable leaked to @entity144 , @entity8 rejected an initiative in 2009 by then - @entity189 leader @entity188 to mediate in @entity11 , telling him that once a true @entity183 government was established in @entity11 , he would move on to other countries , including @entity189			1
he opposes elections , saying " the reality is that democracy is something @entity196 made unlawful , and someone else can not make it lawful			0
" as @entity9 came under greater pressure from the @entity89 force stationed in @entity91 , @entity8 turned to suicide bombings against civilians			1
in december 2009 , an @entity9 bomber killed 23 people at a university graduation ceremony in @entity91			0
some factions inside @entity9 disowned the attack , but @entity8 was unmoved			2
as a northerner , unlike other @entity9 commanders , he did not belong to a clan in the areas controlled by the group and was therefore less concerned about civilian casualties			2
according to a confidential @entity215 assessment , @entity8 demanded more suicide attacks to supplement conventional fighting			2
his rejection of negotiations , poor management of military campaigns and the clan system soon led to dissent in @entity9			2
according to diplomatic cables in 2009 , @entity8 wanted to declare an @entity183 caliphate in areas controlled by @entity9 , which included much of central and southern @entity11			1
others in @entity9 's leadership disagreed , saying the group had to gain greater public support before such a move			2
but fearful of assassination , they kept their counsel			0
the imposition of brutal @entity236 - like law eventually alienated large sections of the population in southern and central @entity11			0
one prominent @entity9 member , the @entity16 @entity239 , said in a video last year that other elements in the group were trying to kill him			2
he followed up with a series of tweets this year attacking @entity8			2
" @entity245 has gone mad			0
he 's starting a civil war , " he said			0
@entity8 responded by ordering the killing of @entity239 , who was wounded by a gunshot in april			0
his intelligence wing finally caught up with @entity239 and killed him in september , just days after he told the @entity251 that @entity8 had " turned @entity9 into an organization that oppresses @entity253 in an effort to win control of @entity11			1
" even longtime supporters and friends , such as @entity258 , have turned against @entity8 , and paid with their lives			0
@entity260 was killed in a shootout in june in the southern town of @entity263			0
the @entity91 source tells @entity0 that several prominent figures in @entity9 -- including @entity266 and @entity267 , two of its old guard -- now fear for their lives			0
@entity8 's purge accelerated during the summer , leading @entity271 to negotiate his surrender to authorities , apparently for his own protection			1
after @entity13 troops drove @entity9 out of population centers in 2011 , pro-al @entity136 hawks within the group gained the upper hand			1
the loss of the port city of @entity284 , the source of much of @entity9 's income , weakened arguments that the group had too much to lose by embracing @entity136 's global jihad			1
one reason @entity8 has emerged triumphant in these internal battles is that he controls @entity9 's intelligence wing , known as @entity290 , a ruthless entity organized in cells and commanded by @entity292 , also known as " karate			1
" counterterrorism analysts say that as other units in the group have been weakened , @entity8 has come to rely heavily on @entity290 , into which he has poured resources and which he sees as the kernel for @entity9 's transformation into a regional @entity136 affiliate			1
and that may ultimately be a source of vulnerability			0
@entity8 's reliance on force in an organization that has long worked as a loose collective has made him a legion of enemies inside @entity11 , and even led to criticism on some jihadist forums sympathetic to @entity136			1
after the @entity50 attack , @entity13 and @entity78 intelligence agencies will undoubtedly step up efforts to end @entity8 's reign of terror			1
but he should not be underestimated			0
a former @entity11 prime minister , @entity316 , described @entity8 as the cleverest of @entity9 's leaders			1
amanpour blog : what is @entity9 's aim in @entity13 attack ?			2

@entity9 chief @entity8 has a *reputation* for being secretive , merciless
@entity8 , 36 , wants his group to be able to deliver devastating attacks beyond @entity11
last year , he formally declared @entity9 an affiliate of @entity136
@entity8 's harsh *tactics* have led to dissent in his group , which he has ruthlessly suppressed
