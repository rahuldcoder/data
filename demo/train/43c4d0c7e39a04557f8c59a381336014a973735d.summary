-- i grew up about 30 minutes north of @entity2 in a town that was a virtual melting pot — i was exposed to all different backgrounds , cultures , and religions , fueling my personal interests in global issues			1
my teenage years were dotted by regular interactions with people like me from all around the world — people i could connect with about these issues			0
i was lucky to be able to expand my understanding of the world in this way			0
now , with the arrival of @entity18 , @entity19 and other social media , young people everywhere in the @entity22 have an incredible opportunity to learn from their peers in other countries and partner to make a huge impact in addressing global health issues			1
i know how hard it can be for young people in high school , college , or just starting out , to balance schoolwork , relationships and other activities			1
but today is @entity37 , and we should each find a way to use the moment to raise awareness about this global pandemic and unite in the fight against @entity44			2
that 's why this weekend i participated in an event with young reproductive health advocates from @entity48 who got up early to tune into a live webcast from @entity52 , @entity53			2
the webcast featured young leaders in the fight against hiv / aids responding to questions from the youth in @entity48 and around the world			2
the conversation focused on how young people are leading the charge in @entity44 advocacy and prevention , and it was a part of @entity64 's and the @entity65 on hiv / aids ' efforts to mark @entity37 on saturday			1
those young people include folks like @entity69 , 17 , and @entity70 , 19 , who work with their peers at @entity74 @entity73 's @entity72			1
the @entity72 is a community program that helps educate young people about reproductive health			1
@entity69 and @entity70 are both giving back to their community and making sure their peers have accurate and comprehensive information about their health care			1
that 's how we 're going to fight @entity67 -- by engaging and empowering young people to help themselves and their peers stay @entity44 free			1
this is the demographic that is most vulnerable to unintended pregnancy , stds and @entity67			2
in fact , worldwide , young people still make up about 40 percent of all new hiv infections			1
while we 've made a lot of progress in fighting @entity44 , we know there is great room for improvement			0
in many countries around the world , young people are still often unable to access quality health care			1
testing and treatment can be problematic where resources and geography make it difficult			0
in the @entity22 , the situation is n't much better , especially for young people			1
a recent @entity108 report finds that more than half of people infected with @entity44 in the @entity22 aged 13 to 24 do n't know they have it			0
that same age group is responsible for more than a quarter of new @entity22 infections each year			0
on " @entity118 , " we often tackle the tough topics that young people face — in fact , my recurring character , @entity116 , is a transgender teenager who finds herself navigating a lot of the same problems many young people face around the globe			1
while these challenges are different everywhere , young people now see themselves connected to the world beyond our borders			1
the @entity130 , mobile technology , the 24 - hour news cycle and immigration have all helped contribute to this new global identity			0
we are living in a world that is increasingly without borders			0
that 's why events like the one i participated in this weekend are so important — they help open a dialogue between young health advocates in the @entity22 and the rest of the world on what programs and policies need to be put in place			2
we need these global conversations if we are going to win the battle against @entity44 , because there is so much we can learn from one another 's successes and continued challenges			0
of course , it wo n't all rest on our shoulders			0
some of our leaders already know just how important this issue is for young people			2
thanks to president @entity160 , under the @entity161 , millions more people will be eligible for health insurance , including many people with @entity44			0
in november , the @entity164 also recommended that all @entity22 aged 15 - 65 receive routine @entity44 testing , not just those most at risk			0
if finalized , this would mean insurers would have to cover @entity44 screening without a co-pay , saving young people some much - needed money			2
with new investments in medically accurate sex education and the evolution of health technology as a means to educate and communicate with more people than ever before , we have new tools to address the @entity44 epidemic			2
on @entity37 and every day , there is much to be done			0
talk to your friends , schoolmates and family — face to face or online — about this global problem , ensure your loved ones get the information and care they need and deserve , and let your legislators know that you support policies that help young people get the care they need			1
it will be impossible for us to eradicate @entity44 as long as any corner of the world is cut off from the education and services that we know helps stop the spread of this disease			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

@entity203 says he grew up in a melting pot near @entity2 , exposed to *diverse* humanity
social media *mirrors* that globally , crucial to aids education for youth
he says young people globally make up 40 *%* of new infections , many have little health care
@entity203 : especially on @entity37 , reach out to ensure others educated about @entity67
