" this is a tremendous loss for the family , her friends and fans around the world , " @entity14 said			2
" she was a true original who could sing it all -- Ã‚ her music defied category			2
" i worked with @entity1 for over 30 years			1
she was my friend and i will miss her always			2
" was " @entity7 " your song for your wedding 's first dance ? the powerhouse singer , known as " @entity1 , " lived an eventful life			1
she first hit the charts as a teenager , taking " @entity4 ( @entity45 , @entity44 ) " -- an " answer record " to @entity48 's " @entity47 " -- to no. 1 on the r&b charts in 1955			2
she joined @entity49 in 1960 and had a string of r&b and pop hits , many with lush string arrangements			2

throughout her career , @entity18 overcame a heroin addiction , opened for the @entity58 , won six @entity59 and was voted into the @entity60			1
despite her ups and downs -- including a number of health problems -- she maintained an optimistic attitude			2
" most of the songs i sing , they have that blue feeling to it			0
they have that sorry feeling			0
and i do n't know what i 'm sorry about , " she told @entity0 's @entity74 in 2002			0
" i do n't ! " through it all , she was a spitfire beloved by contemporaries and young up - and - comers			0
" @entity1 is unmanageable , and i 'm the closest thing she 's ever had to a manager , " @entity79 , her manager of 30 - plus years , told @entity0 in admiration			1

" if you were to look up the word singer in the dictionary , you 'd see their names , " @entity84 said in an interview			2
@entity1 was born @entity1 in @entity95 to a teen mother and unknown father			1
( she suspected her father was the pool player @entity99			0
) her birth mother initially took little responsibility and @entity18 was raised by a series of people , notably a pair of boardinghouse owners			1
but she was recognized from a young age for her booming voice , showcased in a @entity109 church			0
in 1950 , her mother took her to @entity111 , where @entity18 formed a group called the @entity1			1
@entity114 @entity113 , best known for " @entity115 , " discovered her and had her sing a song he wrote using @entity48 's tune as a model			0
" @entity4 , " with responses from " @entity121 " songwriter @entity122 , made @entity18 an r&b star			1
her signing to @entity49 introduced her to a broader audience , as the record label 's co-owner , @entity125 , believed she should do pop hits			0
among her recordings were " @entity129 , " the @entity131 classic originally from 1933 ; " a @entity132 , " which dates from 1946 ; and most notably , " @entity7 , " a 1941 number that was originally a hit for @entity134			0
@entity18 ' version of " @entity7 " starts out with swooning strings and the singer enters with confident gusto , dazzlingly maintaining a mood of joy and romance			1
though the song failed to make the @entity143 upon its 1961 release -- though it did hit the @entity145 -- its emotional punch has long made it a favorite at weddings			0
@entity18 ' career suffered in the mid- ' 60s when the @entity150 took over the pop charts and as she fought some personal demons			1
but she got a boost when she started recording at @entity157 's @entity156 in @entity158 , @entity159			0
her hits included the brassy " @entity162 " and the raw " i 'd @entity164 , " the latter later notably covered by @entity166			0
she entered rehab in the 1970s for her drug problem but re-established herself with live performances and an album produced by noted @entity172 mastermind @entity171			0
after another stint in rehab -- this time at the @entity175 -- she made a comeback album , " @entity177 , " in 1988			0
@entity18 mastered a range of styles -- from r&b and soul to jazz and blues -- but she was always one step behind the popular genre of the day , said @entity185 , a @entity186 professor who has written about jazz and @entity172 and reviews records for @entity189			1
" she never really got her moment in the sun , " @entity185 said			0
but @entity18 soldiered on , and by the end of her life she had made so much meaningful music that she was considered a living legend			1
" by the mid- ' 90s , she 's survived so long that people start to look up to her , " @entity185 said			0
@entity18 was portrayed by pop star @entity198 in the 2008 film " @entity200 , " about @entity125			1
after @entity198 sang " @entity7 " at one of president @entity203 's 2009 inaugural balls , @entity18 lashed out : " i ca n't stand @entity198			1
she had no business up there singing my song that i 've been singing forever			0
" she later told the @entity207 she was joking			0
earlier this year , news reports revealed that the singer 's estate was being contested in a legal struggle between her husband , @entity13 , and son @entity212			2
( @entity212 and her other son , @entity214 , both played in her band			0
) over the years , @entity18 had her share of health problems			1
in the late 1990s she reportedly weighed more than 400 pounds and required a scooter to get around			0
in 2003 she had gastric bypass surgery and dropped more than half the weight , according to @entity221			0
however , until her latest issues , @entity18 maintained a steady touring schedule and appeared full of energy even when sitting down -- as she sometimes did on stage , due to bad knees and her weight battles			1
even while sitting down , @entity18 gave it her all on stage , singing as though possessed , caressing every note like a long - lost love			1
if that seemed a little much to critics , well , the legendary singer had a show to put on , she told @entity236			2
" they said that @entity1 is still vulgar , " she said in the 2002 interview			1
" i said , ' oh , how dare ' em say i 'm still real vulgar ! i 'm vulgar because i dance in the chair ? ' what would they want me to do ? want me to just be still or something like that ? " i got ta do something			0
