well , the @entity0 says climate change is n't a hoax			1
but are we causing it ? oh no - no - no , says half the @entity0			1
forty - nine senators ( full list here ) voted on wednesday against an amendment that said climate change is happening and , crucially , that it 's actually - for - real caused by human emissions			1
that 's something scientists are pretty darn sure about , and have been for more than a decade			1
these votes -- particularly the not - a - hoax vote -- have been heralded by some in environmental circles , including sen. @entity20 , d - @entity21 , as a sign of progress , like a " coming out " party of sorts			1
at least the senators are going on record , the argument goes			0
at least , in a 98 - to - 1 vote , they said , in public , that climate change is not a hoax			1
i 'm not so sure			0
true , there would be value in knowing where every senator stands on climate change			1
@entity40 -- 61 % of whom say climate change is real and 40 % of whom know it 's caused by people , according to to a 2014 @entity45 survey -- have a right to know where their elected officials fall on this and many other important policy issues			1
but -- and this is an important " but " -- that 's not what we learned on wednesday			1
we learned that 98 senators say climate change is happening -- without blaming humans for it			1
among them is @entity60 , @entity61 , who is perhaps @entity63 's most vocal climate denier			1
he continued that streak this week			0
" climate is changing , and climate has always changed , and always will , there 's archaeological evidence of that , there 's biblical evidence of that , " @entity60 said on the @entity0 floor , according to @entity66 and others			1
" the hoax is that there are some people that are so arrogant to think that they are so powerful that they can change climate			1
man ca n't change climate			2
" @entity83 , huh ? we also know that 49 senators voted against the amendment saying climate change is , in fact , caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases			2
that could seem like a win for the left , at least an effort to pin down senators who do n't buy the science saying humans do contribute			0
but among the no votes was sen. @entity99 , @entity100 , who said her reason for voting no simply was the word " significantly , " according to @entity103			0
( the amendment said " human activity significantly contributes " to the warming climate			2
) that 's an artful dodge			2
and it means neither vote offers true clarity			2
these votes are more witch hunt than substance			0
the political left seems to want to embarrass the right for denying the facts of climate change			2
the right , as @entity119 of @entity120 smartly noted , played this brilliantly , appearing to take a the - @entity123 's - not - flat stance on this , while actually ceding next - to - nothing			2
meanwhile , the people we actually need to be listening to on this issue are not the politicians			2
they 're the climate scientists , who have been saying for years that the climate is changing , that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the driving cause , and that we need to act urgently to cut emissions			0
i hate doom - and - gloom climate politics as much as the next guy , but that 's the reality			1
and here 's the other part of it : there 's time to act			0
@entity144 should debate how to respond to climate change , not its very existence			0
the other voices that need to be heard in this debate are those of ordinary people , all over the world , who already are seeing their lives and livelihoods disturbed by warming temperatures and changing oceans			0
i met some of them last year at a 300,000 - person climate rally in @entity159			0
they 're people like @entity160 , this oyster farmer in @entity161			0
and @entity162 , a young mom from the @entity163 , in the @entity164 , whose nation may be sunk by rising sea levels			0
" i am fearful , " she told me , " but for the most part , i 'm optimistic			0
" @entity144 could take note , and so should we			0
we should listen to their stories			0
it 's mostly hot air .			1
