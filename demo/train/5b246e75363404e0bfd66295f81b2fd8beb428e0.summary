-- recently , investors celebrated the birthday of the current bull market , which turned five years old			1
on this anniversary , it 's worth reflecting on how valuations , particularly of technology companies , are being calculated			1
on thursday , the @entity8 reported that @entity9 , a travel rental company , which has not released information about its revenue or profitability , may be approaching a valuation of $ 10 billion			1
other startups in the ipo pipeline include a number of unprofitable companies like @entity18 , with rumored valuations in the billions			1
have billion - dollar or multibillion - dollar valuations become the norm ? is it all about hype and greed nowadays ? whatever happened to the wisdom of investors like @entity27 who evaluated companies based on their profits and fundamental performances ? the value of any company is a function of the cash flow it will generate in the future			1
a healthy cash flow allows a company to repay its shareholders and initial investors who , understandably , expect their investment to be eventually reimbursed			2
ordinary investors who rely on the hype surrounding a company rather than the company 's fundamentals may make decisions that they regret later on			1
just ask anyone who invested in the @entity48 about the danger of falling for overvalued companies			2
granted , everyone in the tech industry -- from startup founders to venture capitalists -- is eager to find and bet on the next big thing			0
still , the money being thrown around is mind - boggling			0
even a decent business model and the potential for growth do not justify a multibillion - dollar valuation			1
yet , @entity62 recently offered an astounding $ 19 billion to buy @entity63 , a popular messaging service			1
though @entity63 has reportedly been able to turn a small profit , this overblown acquisition price is higher than the market cap of 275 companies in the @entity69 500			1
some market watchers have argued , as @entity71 did on @entity0 , that the @entity63 acquisition is indicative of a fundamental shift , and that traditional " old world " methods of determining valuation have been replaced by " new world " metrics			1
for example , @entity71 cited @entity62 's acquisition of @entity63 at $ 42 per user , which is in line with price - per - user acquisitions of companies like @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
this is one way of looking at things , but it 's severely flawed			0
the value of a customer is in the revenue the customer provides , not in his or her mere existence			0
if we look at the price - per - user metric without evaluating revenue per customer , the analysis becomes eerily similar to the late 1990s , during the dotcom boom when , for example , number of " eyeballs " was a metric used to evaluate technology companies			1
counting " eyeballs " or " user base " or " potential " only works in a bull market when market momentum can make poor decisions seem wise			0
perhaps we remember the @entity115 's high of 5048.62 , during the height of the tech boom , and not when it fell to 1114.11 in 2002 when the tech bubble burst			2
but bull markets do not last forever , and it 's important to make sure we 're evaluating companies based on their long - term value , regardless of market cycle			1
of course , not all overvalued companies are " bad " companies			0
@entity126 , for example , has a sizable user base , solid revenue growth and an undeniably disruptive and innovative technology			0
it 's safe to say that @entity126 has a lot of potential			0
however , the company 's valuation is simply not justified by its fundamental performance			0
@entity126 's stock is trading at nearly 45 times its 2013 revenue , and its profit multiple ( a company 's market value expressed in terms of its earnings ) is nonexistent , given that it has yet to establish a profitable business model			1
sure , there are some companies , like @entity146 , that do n't meet traditional metrics of financial strength that end up performing incredibly well in the stock market			2
but they are the exception , not the rule			0
consider the example of @entity155 , one of the hottest ipos of 2006			0
despite losing 97 cents of every dollar in sales , the company had a $ 2.6 billion valuation			2
the company 's fundamentals did not match its valuation			2
the results speak for themselves , with @entity155 shares currently trading at $ 4.53 , down from their $ 17.00 @entity48 price			0
we are forced to accede to the most logical and rational valuation methods ; otherwise , there is no structure to making investment decisions			0
for every @entity146 , there are several @entity174			0
despite what some market watchers say , the " old world " method of valuing companies is still the best way of valuing companies			2
i suppose it 's true that @entity184 made a great discovery by sailing the wrong way around the earth trying to find @entity188			0
here is a case where somebody happened upon great success based on incorrect data and methods			0
however , investors placing their bets on tech companies without basic fundamentals are more likely to resemble @entity199 : map-less and looking hopelessly for the @entity201			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity204 : have billion - dollar valuations of companies become the norm ?
@entity204 : even a decent business model does not justify such high numbers
@entity63 's acquisition price is above market cap of 275 companies in @entity69
@entity204 : investors should value companies based on fundamentals , like profitability
