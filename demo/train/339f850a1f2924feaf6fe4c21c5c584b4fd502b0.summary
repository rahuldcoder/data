@entity0 -- a man charged with drunk driving won his case at the @entity6 @entity5 on wednesday , after the justices concluded police should have first obtained a warrant before conducting a blood test against his will , shortly after arrest			1
at issue was a balancing test between timely gathering of accurate evidence and privacy interests			2
the high court struck down @entity20 's guidelines giving police broad discretion to forego getting a judge 's prior approval before executing a search			1
" we hold that in drunk - driving investigations , the natural dissipation of alcohol in the bloodstream does not constitute an exigency in every case sufficient to justify conducting a blood test without a warrant , " said justice @entity25			1
law enforcement wants flexibility to conduct such " searches " -- saying alcohol dissipates over time and that delays getting a magistrate to sign off on a blood sample can mean justice denied			2
but civil rights advocates say these kinds of " invasive " medical procedures are unnecessary and unconstitutional , absent any extraordinary circumstances negating the warrant requirement			1
the ruling did not provide a bright line rule for either side			0
but it affirmed the existing standard that the " totality of the circumstances " must be considered by police , and was not properly applied in this case			1
the court did not offer law enforcement specifics on how much time can elapse before police would reasonably be able to forego warrants and order blood tests			1
half the states prohibit warrantless blood draws by police in " run - of - the - mill " dui cases			1
the appeal involves @entity69 , 25 , who was stopped in the middle of the night two years ago near @entity71 , @entity20 , for speeding			1
he failed four field sobriety tests administered by highway patrolman @entity73			0
@entity69 then refused a portable @entity75 test on the scene , and was placed under arrest			2
the corporal then transported the suspect to a local hospital when @entity69 said he would not consent to a breath test at jail			2
a blood test was ordered unilaterally by the officer , again over the man 's objections , performed by a trained phlebotomist			1
the motorist 's blood - alcohol content was 0.154 percent , nearly twice the state 's legal limit			2
court records show the time lapse between the initial stop and the blood test was about 30 minutes			1
state courts subsequently divided over whether the test could be admitted as evidence , prompting the @entity5 appeal			2
the @entity99 protects " the right of the people to be secure in their person ... against unreasonable searches and seizure , " and that " no warrants shall issue , except under probable cause			0
" the high court 's guiding standard has long been " reasonableness " and the justices here again said the warrant requirement can be suspended under exigent circumstances , such as the risk of endangering lives or destruction of evidence			0
but the court has also said state intrusions into one 's own body generally require prior review and approval by a judge			0
the @entity124 administration is backing @entity20 , saying there is a strong federal interest in deterring drunk driving			1
the court 's nuanced opinion was not a total defeat for law enforcement			0
indeed , the per se threat of a needle -- with or without a warrant -- may be enough of an incentive for suspected drunks to agree to less invasive breath tests			0
both sides concede that dynamic already exists in many cases			0
but chief justice @entity141 issued a separate " concurrence " to the ruling , lamenting the lack of the court 's specificity			0
" a police officer reading this court 's opinion would have no idea , no idea , what the @entity99 requires of him , once he decides to obtain a blood sample from a drunk driving suspect who has refused a breathalyzer test , " he said			1
the decision will likely mean police may be required to adopt more extensive guidelines on its testing policies , narrowing the emergency exceptions to the warrant requirement			1
the practical effect may be to force officers to streamline and speed up the warrant process , so that drunk drivers are tested before it is too late to preserve the evidence			2
@entity25 acknowledged that in her opinion			0
" technological developments that enable police officers to secure warrants more quickly , and do so without undermining the neutral magistrate judge 's essential role as a check on police discretion , are relevant to an assessment of exigency , " she said			0
more than 10,000 people were killed in alcohol - related motor vehicle incidents in 2010			0
that is one death every 51 minutes			0
another 500,000 people on average are injured annually in booze - fueled crashes .			0

case involved rights of suspect in @entity20 drunk driving case
*question* was whether police needed a warrant before seeking a blood test
decision will likely mean police may be required to adopt new guidelines
