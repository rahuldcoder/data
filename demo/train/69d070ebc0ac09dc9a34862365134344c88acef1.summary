yes , @entity0 can sing -- all by herself , thank you very much			1
that much she showed thursday , when she opened her appearance before reporters in @entity5 -- where she 's set to headline the @entity8 halftime performance sunday -- with a stirring , a cappella rendition of the national anthem			1
it was the same tune she sang just over a week ago at the inauguration of president @entity14 but on that momentous occasion , @entity0 admitted on thursday , she had some help			1
the world - renowned pop singer told reporters that " she decided to sing along with my prerecorded track , " a decision she made in part because she did n't have time to rehearse with the @entity25 and had had " no proper sound check			1
" " i did not feel comfortable taking a risk , " @entity0 said of what she called " a very , very important , emotional show for me			1
" " i wanted to make ( @entity14 ) and the country proud			1
" the admission about the january 21 performance was n't a complete shock			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity25 initially said @entity0 " was not actually singing " the national anthem			2
hours later , the band backed away from the spokeswoman 's remarks , releasing a statement that said the group was not in a position to know for sure			0
but that hardly stopped the speculation that one of @entity46 's most famous contemporary singers had lip synced at one of the nation 's most important moments			2
two days after the inauguration , an inaugural official who asked not to be identified said @entity0 " did not sing live , " even though " she was spot on " in her prerecording , which was taped separately from the band and then married together			1
the @entity56 native had been mum on the topic until she discussed the matter thursday			0
calling herself a perfectionist who will typically " practice until my feet bleed , " she conceded worrying about potential problems during " a live television show " taking place outside on a chilly @entity67 day			0
even with all the hubbub -- and her insistence that " i always sing live , " with that exception -- @entity0 expressed no regrets about her rendition of " @entity73 " in front of the @entity75			2
" i 'm very proud of my performance , " she said			1
the 31 - year - old said the practice of performers singing along with prerecorded tracks is common in her industry			2
still , she promised she wo n't be doing it sunday during the @entity84 halftime show			1
" i will absolutely be singing live , " @entity0 said			0
" this is what i was born to do			0
" as to exactly what she 'll do , and with whom , she did n't say much thursday , dodging a question about whether she will be joined by her @entity90 bandmates or her husband , critically acclaimed rapper @entity92 while @entity94 and @entity95 ( the latter singing with the choir from @entity98 , the @entity99 school where 20 children were killed in december ) also will perform , @entity93 will command the stage once the @entity102 and @entity103 break for halftime			0
" i 'm trying to learn to live every moment , because these moments are not promised to us , " she said of her excitement , recalling how she took off her shoes and ran the first time she set foot on the @entity110 field			0
" this is such a huge opportunity			0
" it 's also a huge challenge , including working on a stage that needs to be put together in just more than seven minutes , condensing her career into one 12 - minute set , then performing in what is often any given year 's most watched program on television			0
@entity0 admitted being nervous , but also said that after more than four months of preparation , she 's prepared			1
" i 've had a 16 - year career , and all of the things that i 've done have prepared me for this , " she said			0

@entity0 says , " i 'm very proud of my performance " at president @entity14 's inauguration
she sang with a prerecorded track because she " did not feel comfortable taking a risk "
@entity135 vows she wo n't lip - sync sunday , when she heads up the @entity137
