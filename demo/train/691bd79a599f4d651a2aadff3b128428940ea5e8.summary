-- " @entity1 is not something that exists in dresses only , " @entity0 once said			0
" @entity1 is in the sky , in the street , fashion has to do with ideas , the way we live , what is happening "			1
and what is happening , now that everyone is a smartphone owner , is that fashion and technology , traditionally uncomfortable bedfellows , are coming together like never before			1
fashion editors were invited to the launch of the brand new @entity19 , showing how much the ground has shifted			1
@entity22 has teamed up with sunglasses brand @entity23 , which makes @entity25 and @entity26 , to design a new range of its glass wear			0
and @entity29 , @entity30 's founder and chair of the @entity32 , declared she wanted @entity33 to be " the most tech - savvy fashion capital in the world , " as she launched @entity36 with @entity22			1
" innovation is hugely important for brands to showcase , " said @entity37 , head of the fashion innovation agency at @entity39			1
" there 's recognition that the technology industry needs to engage with fashion lifestyle			1
all physical stores , not just premium brands , need to create a full experience for customers			1
" @entity37 worked with @entity50 on the first digital skirt made from mobile phones and with @entity53 on the first wireless charging trousers			0
he added : " the brand has to live online and offline			0
" @entity56 , which has more than 17 million likes on @entity58 , is one luxury brand that has fully embraced fashion tech. @entity56 , the @entity61 fashion house , is a pioneer in fashion technology			1
it has integrated the physical and digital in its flagship stores in @entity33 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
mirrors become screens showcasing catwalk images			0
there are about 100 screens and 500 speakers			0
there are no cash tills ( like @entity19 stores ) and you pay on devices			2
you can even experience weather -- simulated rain showers / sounds of thunder -- just to remind you why you might need a @entity56 trench coat			1
they 've rolled out the augmented technology with intelligent mirrors to show the outfit you 're trying as if you were the star of a catwalk show			2
luxury retailers have been early adopters of new technology and are more advanced in the field than high street retailers , with greater focus on enhancing the in - store experience with video and microchips in clothing for shoppers to interact with			1
@entity101 , the former ceo of @entity56 who oversaw its digital revolution , was subsequently poached by @entity19 to help run their stores and develop new products			1
although the average town 's main chains have been slower to embrace fashion technology , there are signs of change			1
stores have begun to embrace " showrooming , " where people examine the merchandise but purchase later online , often at lower cost , as an opportunity to engage			2
@entity118 put digital at the heart of its @entity36 show by inviting influential bloggers to curate , for example			0
chains are also embracing innovation through augmented reality software			0
using camera - equipped mobile devices , apps can take detailed personal measurements to ensure clothes will be a perfect fit			0
the company @entity134 , founded in 2010 , is a leading provider of virtual fitting room solutions			0
clothes are photographed on robotic mannequins , allowing shoppers to try items on virtually			0
it means shoppers can try on every size with a few clicks and then choose the best fit			0
@entity144 , chief executive of the start - up , explained : " i 'm a big online shopper and like many men i do n't like to try on clothes			0
instead of doing that thing where you buy three sizes we decided to try @entity151 with robots			0
" we have become better online than in stores			2
online tech in retail can track where people go on the site			2
such innovation needs to move back to the physical store			0
" the firm , @entity162 , has combined a fabric that changed color in the presence of certain pollutants and a sensor that detected the color change and uploaded the results to the cloud to produce a prototype garment that monitored air quality in @entity173			0
@entity174 and @entity175 have been looking at embedding sensors that connect to smartphones to give a more complete picture of someone 's training regime or real - time health			0
even @entity182 , which is seen as a more traditional brand , has launched a polo shirt that records the wearer 's biometric data			1
for companies like these , the goal is to create technical clothing that can passively monitor your health and activity without the wearer having to think about it or carry around additional technology			1
the forthcoming @entity19 and @entity199 6 launch promised a new era for wearable technology			2
" for the first time fashion is not just an add - on for technology			1
in the past a bag with a pouch for a phone was the extent of it , " said @entity205 , from trend forecaster @entity206			0
" now there 's a partnership with fashion labels			2
with technology getting smaller , there 's no reason that it wo n't be embedded in collections and accessories			2
" but others are more skeptical about wearables			2
@entity223 , head of innovation labs at digital agency @entity225 , said : " strictly speaking , ever since @entity226 launched their @entity228 calculator watch , we 've been stealthily trying to combine our technology with our clothes , our watches , our hats , even our shoes			2
" arguably , @entity19 have not created anything unique in terms of technical innovation			0
however , they have placed mobile , contactless payments at the heart of their new devices			0
" @entity223 is more excited by the potential of smart fabrics , cloths that can be embedded with sensors and microprocessors that can communicate with mobile phones to process information such as the wearers ' heart rate or temperature			1
and that is potentially the future of fashion technology : seamless , subtle and intuitive			1
