@entity0 , @entity1 -- sen. @entity3 kicks off a three - day swing monday across @entity5 , holding campaign - style events and fund - raisers with local politicians as the potential @entity10 presidential contender barnstorms the first - in - the - nation caucus state			1
@entity3 's route will take him through nine cities from the state 's western border to its eastern edge			1
the @entity17 @entity10 will also help the state @entity10 open multiple offices ahead of the midterm elections			0
" it 's very important for sen. @entity3 to hear the concerns of average @entity26 as well as job creators , " said @entity21 , @entity3 's chief @entity5 strategist and a longtime political operative in the @entity5			1
as @entity3 lays the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign , he has kept @entity5 a top priority			1
this is his fourth trip there since the 2012 presidential election			1
@entity3 will leave the state on wednesday , a day before the start of the @entity36 , a popular venue for presidential hopefuls			1
a small swarm of other potential @entity41 contenders will travel to @entity5 this weekend to attend a popular event for social conservatives			0
but @entity3 wo n't be there , preferring to give the candidates he 's been helping some breathing room and allow them to be the focus			2
poll : republicans slightly behind @entity50 in key 2016 states @entity52 , a political science professor at the @entity53 , said the senator 's plan is n't a bad idea , especially in a midterm election year			2
" you want to come in and do favors for @entity5 politicians , " he said			1
" if you 're at the state fair , the attention is on you and not the person you 're trying to help			0
" " next year , you call in those favors , " he added			0
" that 's how it works			0
" @entity3 actually starts the week in @entity0 , @entity1 , where he 'll appear publicly with @entity66 , the @entity41 nominee for @entity1 's open @entity68 seat			2
then , he 'll quickly hop across the state line to help the @entity41 open an office in @entity71 , where he 's expected to appear with the state 's @entity68 nominee , @entity72			0
potential 2016 @entity41 candidates tout conservative principles in @entity5 later monday he travels north to @entity76 for another office opening , and then to a fund - raiser farther north , in @entity79 , for rep. @entity80 , a longtime congressman with considerable sway among the state 's social conservatives			1
tuesday morning @entity3 is back on the road for a fund - raiser in @entity86 , before a stop at the @entity5 @entity41 office in @entity89			2
continuing east , he 'll attend a fund - raiser for @entity93 - @entity92 ' congressional campaign in @entity94 , and then he has two events in @entity96 , including a tour of the corporate headquarters of @entity100 department stores			0
wednesday he attends a breakfast in @entity102 and wraps up his public appearances for the week with another @entity41 office opening in the same city , a suburb of @entity107			0
on some issues , @entity3 and @entity108 sound a lot alike @entity3 's political action committee , @entity3 , has made two big hires from @entity5 in recent months : @entity21 -- who 's also a former state representative and state party chairman -- and @entity114 , a prominent figure among @entity5 's libertarian - leaning @entity10			1
@entity3 's father , former @entity117 rep. @entity116 , generated a huge following in @entity5 during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns			1
the libertarian movement went on to gain sizable influence in the state 's @entity10 after the election -- @entity114 , for example , became state @entity41 chairman -- but mainstream @entity10 took back control of the party earlier this year			2
a big question will be whether @entity3 , who 's considered more moderate than his father , can re-energize the so - called @entity132 faction of the state party , while also garnering support from its social conservatives and mainstream republicans			2
" one of the reasons i signed on to work with sen. @entity3 is i could see how he appeals to all of our party , " @entity21 said			0
" there are very few candidates who have that ability to unify our party			0
i think that he can do that			0

@entity3 kicks off a three - day swing monday across the first - in - the - nation caucus state
the state would be crucial for @entity3 if he runs for president in 2016
" you want to come in and do favors for @entity5 politicians , " @entity5 political expert says
this is @entity3 's fourth trip to the @entity5 since the 2012 presidential election
