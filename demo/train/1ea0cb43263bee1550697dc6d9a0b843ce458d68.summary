the @entity14 said monday that over the past few days some 65,000 people had fled what had been the fighting zone in northeast @entity9 , bringing to 265,000 the number of internally displaced people , which it refers to as @entity21			1
" this latest massive influx of people , who have endured extreme conditions , will put an even greater strain on the transit and @entity21 sites that are already buckling under the pressure of the existing @entity21 population , " the @entity14 high commissioner for refugees said in a written statement			1
the agency pledged to erect an additional 10,000 shelters to accommodate people streaming from the combat zone			1
it reiterated its request for the @entity9 government to set aside land for the construction of emergency shelters , water and sanitation facilities and public buildings in @entity13 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			1
and it called on the government to improve conditions at 42 sites already hosting the displaced people , and to ensure adequate care and maintenance for them			1
but the @entity14 said its access to the sites in @entity13 had been curtailed in recent days " and this affects our ability to monitor and distribute aid to the displaced			1
we hope this ends quickly			0
" @entity61 , aid agency @entity62 's national director , said , " the conventional war may be over but the real challenge now is to foster an environment where fractured and displaced @entity6 communities can heal and have a real chance at creating a future for themselves and their children			1
" among the pressing issues , he said , is getting people back to their land and homes as quickly as possible , which in some cases will require that land be demined and buildings be repaired			2
about 80,000 of the displaced -- a third of the people in camps -- are children , who need emotional , psychosocial and educational support in addition to physical aid			1
" it is important to get people home as quickly as possible so they can feel a sense of ownership over their own lives , recover their dignity and livelihoods and create an environment where their children feel safe , " he said			2
in a telephone interview from @entity97 , @entity9 's most populous city , @entity61 said that the displacement camps are overcrowded , with two and three families staying in shelters intended for a single family			1
" a lot more needs to be done , " he said			0
" more land needs to be cleared , more shelters set up " and safe drinking - water supplies assured			2
" it 's not easy and it 's not straightforward			0
" he said many of the people still streaming into the camps are malnourished			2
though the end of the conflict marks a great opportunity , " we can do with all the international support that we can get at this time , " he said			0
estimates put the number of civilians killed in the conflict at 70,000 to 80,000 , but @entity61 acknowledged that the true number may never be known			2
@entity124 , the aid group also known as @entity124 , was trying to scale up on monday , a spokeswoman said			0
the group 's head of mission , @entity126 , said the 1999 @entity130 - winning organization is staffing three hospitals in the region , where it was screening people seeking help to determine their needs , stabilize them , then treat them			2
with fighting apparently ended , @entity126 predicted that the organization 's team of 343 national staff and approximately 50 international staff will focus many of their efforts on providing post-operative care			0
" we have a lot of wounded people , " he said			0
one area of need that remains largely unaddressed , he said , is mental health			0
@entity148 called for steps to be taken to ensure civilians and captured fighters are protected			0
" the @entity9 government must ensure that its forces fully respect international law , including all provisions relating to protecting civilians from the effect of hostilities , " said @entity148 's @entity153 director , @entity152			2
@entity148 called on the @entity9 government to give humanitarian agencies full access ; to allow independent observers to monitor the situation to guard against human - rights violations ; and to register displaced people as a safeguard against enforced disappearances			1
@entity152 called on the international community to deploy monitors			0
in @entity173 , @entity172 spokesman @entity171 called the end of fighting " an opportunity for @entity9 to turn the page on its past and build a @entity9 rooted in democracy , tolerance , and respect for human rights			1
" he said it is " vital for the government to provide for the needs of the civilians now living in relief camps			0
providing food , water , shelter , basic health care , and sanitation as well as expediting their return to their homes should be a top priority for the government			0
