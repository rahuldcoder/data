after 37 years , @entity2 , an organization whose mission was to " help " gay @entity4 become straight , is shutting down			1
but not before issuing an apology			1
" we 're not negating the ways @entity9 used @entity2 to positively affect thousands of people , but a new generation of @entity4 is looking for change -- and they want to be heard , " @entity6 , an @entity2 board member , said wednesday			1
the announcement comes less than a day after @entity2 issued a wide - ranging apology to the gay community for " years of undue judgment by the organization and the @entity20 as a whole , " a statement from the group says			1
" @entity2 is an institution in the conservative @entity20 world , but we 've ceased to be a living , breathing organism , " said @entity22 , the president of @entity2			1
" for quite some time , we 've been imprisoned in a worldview that 's neither honoring toward our fellow human beings , nor biblical			0
" @entity29 , who has a wife and children and previously identified as gay , has acknowledged that he has " ongoing same - sex attractions			1
" @entity35 : oops , i left my sexual orientation at home " it is strange to be someone who has both been hurt by the @entity20 's treatment of the lgbtq community , and also to be someone who must apologize for being part of the very system of ignorance that perpetuated that hurt , " @entity29 said			1
" today it is as if i 've just woken up to a greater sense of how painful it is to be a sinner in the hands of an angry church			0
" @entity42 stands for lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and questioning			2
@entity58 law banning gay ' conversion therapy ' put on hold new focus on a therapy @entity2 , which has promoted " freedom from homosexuality through the power of @entity66 , " has de-emphasized conversion therapy in recent years as more of the counselors in its network have abandoned the practice			1
the @entity71 defines conversion therapy as aimed at changing sexual orientation , but adopted a resolution in 2009 condemning the practice			0
in it , the organization said " mental health professionals should avoid telling clients that they can change their sexual orientation through therapy or other treatments			0
" but the same resolution also encouraged therapists to consider the religious beliefs of clients who say such beliefs are important to their views of homosexuality			2
the @entity90 removed homosexuality from its @entity92 in 1975			2
but yet with the apology , some things have not changed , according to @entity29			2
" i can not apologize for my deeply held biblical beliefs about the boundaries i see in scripture surrounding sex , but i will exercise my beliefs with great care and respect for those who do not share them , " he said			0
" i can not apologize for my beliefs about marriage			0
but i do not have any desire to fight you on your beliefs or the rights that you seek			0
" conversion therapist : @entity113 wo n't stop us a new ministry with the closing of @entity2 , the board of directors voted to begin a new and separate ministry called @entity118			1
" this is a new season of ministry , to a new generation , " @entity29 said			2
" our goals are to reduce fear , and come alongside churches to become safe , welcoming and mutually transforming communities			0
" it 's meant to align with @entity66 ' @entity128 message found in @entity129 -- " a new command i give you : love one another			1
as i have loved you , so you must love one another			0
" " from a @entity20 perspective , gay , straight or otherwise , we 're all prodigal sons and daughters , " @entity29 said			0
" @entity2 is the prodigal 's older brother , trying to impose its will on @entity9 's promises , and make judgments on who 's worthy of his kingdom			1
" @entity9 is calling us to be the father -- to welcome everyone , to love unhindered			0
" gay men sue counselors who promised to make them straight			0
