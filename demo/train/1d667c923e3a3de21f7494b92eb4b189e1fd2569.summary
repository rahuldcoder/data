-- the first two doses of an experimental serum created to treat @entity3 went to @entity5 missionaries			1
then the drug was sent to treat a @entity8 priest			2
the two @entity5 , dr. @entity9 and @entity10 , appear to be recovering			0
the priest , @entity11 , died tuesday morning			2
that 's the problem with experimental drugs that have never been clinically tested in humans : no one knows whether they 'll work -- and if they do , in whom			2
this week , the @entity18 gathered a group of ethicists to decide whether unproven medications and vaccines should be used in the current @entity3 outbreak			1
as the death toll from the epidemic soared over 1,000 , the @entity18 panel unanimously concluded that it is ethical to offer medications to fight the ebola virus , even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown			1
" the large number of people affected by the 2014 west @entity34 outbreak , and the high case - fatality rate , have prompted calls to use investigational medical interventions to try to save the lives of patients and to curb the epidemic , " the @entity18 said tuesday			1
who says it believes the virus has infected 1,848 people and killed 1,013 , making this the deadliest @entity3 outbreak in history			1
the difference between this outbreak and other @entity3 outbreaks is that traditional methods of stopping the virus from spreading -- protective gear , contact tracing , etc. -- do n't seem to be working fast enough , said dr. @entity53 , @entity18 's assistant director - general			1
the health care systems in the affected countries are also weak , so resources are scarce			0
" if these treatments can save lives ... should we not use them to save lives ? " @entity53 said the panel asked			2
after the panel 's decision , @entity63 health minister @entity62 announced tuesday her government will donate between 800 and 1,000 doses of an experimental @entity3 vaccine to @entity18			1
a " small supply " will be kept at home " in the unlikely event it is needed for compassionate use in @entity63 , " the @entity69 said in a news release			1
the drug -- called @entity77 -- is @entity63 - made and owned , having been developed by the @entity78			1
it 's never been tested on humans , " but has shown promise in animal research , " the agency states			0
a @entity63 government ethics advisory group and the @entity18 panel of medical ethics experts both " informed " the decision to give out @entity77 - @entity77 , despite its " unknown efficacy and adverse effects			1
" will it work is just one of the key questions surrounding @entity77			0
as with @entity94 , other questions include how and on whom it should be used			1
a vicious killer @entity3 can torment its victims with high fevers , internal and external bleeding , vomiting and diarrhea			2
it often afflicts multiple organ systems and can kill up to 90 % of those infected			0
the virus spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood , saliva and urine			0
since the current @entity3 epidemic was declared in @entity114 in march , the disease has spread to @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			1
and the impact has spread around the world			0
@entity120 , a native of @entity116 living in @entity121 , has lost nine family members to @entity3 in less than two months			1
" every time you pick up the phone and you receive a call ... this family is dead , this person is dead , " @entity120 told @entity0 affiliate @entity123			0
then other relatives who had been taking care of him			0
@entity120 - @entity134 even lost her younger sister , who had just recently graduated from college			0
" your entire family die in a month and a half , " she said			0
" it 's just so scary			0
i 'm just so confused			0
i do n't even know what to do			0
" there are several experimental drugs and vaccines being created for @entity3 , @entity53 said , though none has been through the necessary human trials to prove safety and efficacy			1
and none of them is currently available in unlimited supply			0
this outbreak , she said , is an opportunity to right a wrong			0
" the fact that there is no drug for @entity3 is a market failure			1
this is typically a disease of poor people in poor countries where there is no market			0
" desperation has pushed @entity116 's government to ask for the experimental serum used to treat the @entity5 and @entity8 priest , in order to treat two local doctors			1
the @entity171 approved @entity116 's request for access to @entity94 , which was created by the @entity176 - based biotech firm @entity175 sample doses of the medicine will be sent to @entity116 this week to treat doctors who have contracted the virus , the @entity116 government said			1
@entity175 said monday that its supply has been exhausted after fulfilling the request of a @entity184 country			0
( it did not name the country			0
) @entity186 , which manufactures a version of the drug , is working to increase production of @entity94 , but the process will take several months , company spokesman @entity185 said last week			1
" there are not adequate supplies of any of the investigational agents anywhere near ready for human use , " said dr. @entity191 , director of the @entity192 at @entity193 , referring to all drugs being developed to treat @entity3			2
" not ( adequate ) to treat all the patients in this outbreak , even if we knew they worked			0
" questions about drug access the gulf between developed and developing nations appeared to some to widen last week as reports emerged that the @entity3 drug was being used to treat @entity208 but not @entity209			1
" what if it had killed both of them ? " @entity214 , director of the @entity215 at @entity216 in @entity217 , said about the two @entity5 first treated with @entity94			2
" it is only because it worked , seemingly very well , that people are screaming , ' how come people in @entity34 did n't get it ? ' " @entity214 said that considering the converse situation could provide some perspective			0
" if the first people ( to receive doses of @entity94 ) would have been @entity116 , headlines would have screamed , ' experimental drug tested on poor @entity34 , ' " @entity214 said			1
but the nagging question for some : was giving the serum to @entity34 even a consideration ? should it have been ? " why did n't dr. sheik @entity234 , the chief @entity115 physician who died while treating @entity3 patients , receive this medication ? " @entity237 wrote in a recent @entity0 opinion piece			1
" because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here -- the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a westerner rather than a resident of the @entity250			2
" who will convene a panel at the end of the month to discuss who should get priority access to the experimental drugs , @entity53 said			2
who will not broker access , she noted , meaning it will not be responsible for doling out doses			2
it will simply provide information about companies that have quantities available to people or government agencies that are asking			0
drug safety concerns more relevant than who got what and when , experts say , are questions about the safety of the current crop of experimental @entity3 drugs			1
for @entity94 and other @entity3 drugs currently in the pipeline -- like @entity3 by @entity278 -- there are not good , substantive data in humans to support their use			1
" usually , you treat large numbers of sick people to be sure something is n't going to hurt them , " said @entity191 , former chief scientist with the @entity171			0
" so while it seems at first glance that two individuals getting something promising in animals and then improving , is convincing , i do n't think it 's yet convincing			2
i think it 's hopeful			0
" @entity214 , @entity296 and @entity191 agree that careful study should precede widespread dissemination of any @entity3 drug and that @entity34 should be represented in those studies			1
" if ( @entity94 ) turns out to be as effective as it seems to be , and it 's possible to make much more of it , then we end up with a situation where it becomes unethical to withhold treatment , " @entity214 said			2
" we should do everything we can to nip this epidemic in the bud			0
" ebola outbreak likely started with 2 - year - old in @entity114 nine things to know about the ebola virus treating @entity3 in @entity115 : ' we are two steps behind ' @entity0 's @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			2

new : @entity63 to offer who up to 1,000 doses of experimental @entity3 vaccine
@entity18 panel : it is ethical to offer unproven medication to try to fight @entity3
pair who took an experimental drug appear to be improving , but one man who took it died
sample doses of the experimental drug @entity94 are on their way to @entity116
