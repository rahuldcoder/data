-- the federal government shutdown is a virtually unprecedented move by a political minority committed to rolling back one of the most significant legislative achievements in recent @entity7 history			1
the @entity8 of 2010 was passed by two houses of @entity10 after 14 months of debate			1
opponents then challenged the law 's constitutionality and lost that battle in the @entity16			1
less than five months later , @entity7 voters re-elected by a 5 million - vote majority margin a president who stood foursquare behind the @entity8			1
in so doing , the electorate rejected a @entity22 presidential candidate who promised its repeal			1
apparently the democratic processes by which @entity7 make choices and govern themselves are not acceptable to extremists in the @entity27 who seek to halt government or have their way			1
they would have @entity7 see their actions as a patriotic and high - minded defense of liberty			1
as the shutdown loomed , several @entity22 congressmen and analysts took to the airwaves to trivialize the significance of the @entity27 vote			2
some cited previous episodes to suggest that closing the federal government is a normal byproduct of the @entity7 people having " a very deep disagreement about the future of our country			2
" rep. @entity48 , a @entity49 @entity22 and member of the @entity51 , took a different tack and in so doing revealed what was really under way			2
@entity48 insisted that president @entity55 was guilty of recalcitrance in the face of reasonable @entity58 who simply sought a workable compromise			0
" we have moved over the last week , " @entity48 insisted in an interview with @entity0 's @entity61			0
" we first had a defund @entity8 bill			2
we then moved to a delay @entity8 bill			2
and tonight ... we said ' let 's delay the individual mandate			0
' " each step , in fact , had been an effort to shatter what the democratic process had painstakingly achieved			0
such rhetorical sleights of hand should not obscure the very radical departure the closure of most of the federal government represents			0
some members of the @entity27 apparently believe their steadfast opposition to the @entity81 law justifies the use of coercive threats : to defund @entity7 government and harm the economy			1
in seeking to trump a lawful vote of both houses of @entity10 , a @entity16 ruling and a reaffirming national presidential election , they tread on extremist ground			1
their hubris is radical and nothing in modern @entity7 history provides a fair counterpart			1
to be sure , each major expansion of the @entity7 federal government 's role in ensuring @entity99 , access to health care , and equal civil rights has been accompanied by intense ideological and partisan conflicts			2
but when milestone laws have survived the gantlet of @entity10 , been affirmed in a presidential signing ceremony , and withstood @entity16 review , the losing party or faction has generally settled for taking arguments about repeal or revisions to the voters			1
they have also , to be sure , continued efforts to chip away at enforcement or funding through normal legislative steps			0
republicans pushed back at parts of the @entity120 of 1935 for more than 15 years , for example , but they never threatened to close down the entire federal government unless @entity123 agreed to undo their own crowning @entity125 legislative achievement			0
republicans also continued to try to amend the @entity127 until their partial success in the @entity130 legislation of 1947 ; but the @entity127 itself was never a subject of extortive efforts to defund the whole government			0
since 1976 , policy fights have at times shut down the federal government			0
congressional disputes over federal funding of abortion led to several funding gaps during the @entity142 administration			0
clashes over government spending , program cuts and other policy issues , including funding of the @entity148 , led to similar results in the @entity151 administration			0
in december 1995 , the @entity153 administration experienced the longest shutdown in modern @entity7 history when @entity27 @entity58 attempted to extract a balanced budget from the president -- and failed as public opinion turned against the @entity22			1
but in none of these episodes did a minority attempt to undo a major law by the sorts of threats against democratic decisions we see today			1
some might argue that the actions of @entity22 @entity27 members are justified by the sweeping changes @entity81 promises to bring			2
this law does seek to fulfill a century - long dream of reformers to ensure access to affordable health insurance to virtually all @entity7 citizens			1
but the core provisions are far from radical			0
devised by the conservative @entity177 and first tested in @entity178 under @entity179 gov. @entity179 , the central tenets of @entity81 respect and build upon private market mechanisms and long - established public programs like @entity184 for the poor and disabled			1
no , the extremism of the present moment should not be understood as a fair response to a governmental expansion some consider too vast			0
unprecedented efforts to try to repeal or gut a major law by threatening the nation 's government and economy are a symptom of a political party that has allowed a faction to pull it far away from fundamental democratic values			0
we can only hope that saner heads and hearts will soon prevail			0
