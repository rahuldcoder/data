-- @entity1 resumed in the @entity3 presidential election on thursday following the violent death of shooting suspect @entity5 following a police siege in @entity7			1
@entity5 was wanted for the killings of three @entity3 paratroopers and of three children and a rabbi at a @entity13 school in the city , in a string of shootings beginning march 11 that shook the nation			1
@entity5 had told @entity3 police he trained with @entity21 in @entity22 , and he had planned to attack more soldiers and police , @entity19 prosecutor @entity18 said			1
he said he was acting alone , the prosecutor added			0
most candidates in the election suspended campaigning following the most recent shooting in @entity7 , but normal politics resumed following the bloody end to the siege			1
how did candidates react to the crisis ? most candidates called for national unity amid the national outpouring of grief for the victims			1
president @entity39 , who is running for a second term , visited @entity7 and offered his sympathies to bereaved families			1
other candidates even flew to the city on the same plane to show their respects			2
@entity39 's main rival , @entity49 candidate @entity48 , suspended his campaign " to honor the memories " of the victims			1
far - right candidate @entity53 initially cancelled campaign events , saying politics must be suspended " as a sign of compassion and solidarity			1
" did the mood of unity hold ? in a word , no. @entity62 , who is running in third place in opinion polls , was the first to break ranks with this rare outbreak of political consensus , @entity0 's @entity61 noted			2
the @entity71 leader said " the danger of fundamentalism has been under - estimated in our country			0
" this sparked an angry response from far - left challenger @entity78 , who accused the @entity71 of being " vultures " feeding at the scene of crimes			0
centrist candidate @entity82 accused the extreme right of trying to " surf " to power on the back of the attacks			0
@entity82 , currently in fourth place , refused to suspend his campaign during the hunt for the attackers , and criticized rivals for their anti-immigrant comments , which he said may have provoked the suspect into action			0
other candidates said it was impossible to make this link			2
was race an issue before the attacks ? along with the economic crisis , immigration and race have been prevalent themes in the campaign for the presidential election , the first round of which takes place next month			1
@entity39 declared this month there were " too many foreigners " in @entity3 , while @entity62 has criticized the production of @entity115 halal meat in @entity19			1
political analyst @entity117 , from the @entity118 in @entity19 , said @entity39 won the 2007 election by being right - wing , and taking a strong stance on race , but had found it difficult to maintain this stance while in power			2
" in this election , @entity62 is saying the original is better than the copy , and that voters should not believe @entity39 on race , " he told @entity0			2
" whichever viewpoint is true though , the president has a record of five years of creating conflict , and while he may say he was right to raise the issue of the growth of @entity115 fundamentalists in @entity3 , maybe now is the time to appease tensions on race			1
" how do the public view @entity39 's handling of the crisis ? the president , who had been lagging behind @entity48 for most of the campaign , seems to have received an initial political boost from the tragedy , said political commentator @entity146 , senior analyst for @entity3 3 tv			1
" @entity39 is observed by many people to have been acting well and decisively during the crisis , " he said			0
but the socialists were asking why it took more than 30 hours to kill @entity5 -- and how he could kill so many people while he was under surveillance by security services			1
" @entity39 must tread warily : a year ago he oversaw the ban on @entity115 veils in public but he is aware there are six million @entity159 in @entity3 , half of them from @entity162 former colonies , and he is careful to say few of them are radical			1
" so if @entity39 is to beat @entity48 he must win over the electorate of both the center , and the far - right of @entity62			0
he needs all the people			0
" the crisis could yet have a negative effect on @entity39 though , with the far - right saying that the government had failed to protect @entity3 people from @entity115 fundamentalists			2
@entity174 , senior political correspondent for @entity175 , said that while @entity39 had benefited from appearing statesmanlike in recent weeks it remained to be seen what long - term advantage he would gain			0
" he is certainly anxious to resume campaigning " to create momentum , @entity174 noted			0
what impact will the attacks have on campaigning ? many voters are keen for the political rhetoric to cool and the focus to turn to more mundane matters			0
the state of the economy and unemployment , especially among the young and ethnic minorities , remains the main concern for most voters			0
for this reason , as @entity194 noted , @entity39 may be keen to keep the focus on security and the @entity7 attacks -- issues on which he looks strong			2
before the crisis , @entity48 was ahead in the polls thanks to a strong showing on economic issues , @entity146 said but added that even on this issue the president was gaining ground			0
" lots of people are telling me that between @entity48 and @entity39 , ' we might switch our votes to @entity39			0
' " this debate between @entity39 and @entity48 is turning into a battle between two heavyweight fighters , but amid the storm of the economic crisis and world upheavals a lot of people are coming back to @entity39			0
