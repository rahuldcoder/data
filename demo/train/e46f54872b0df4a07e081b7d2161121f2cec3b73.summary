-- author @entity1 has just wrapped a long day at the @entity2 , working with several thousand boys and girls who dream of stardom on the @entity7 stage			1
count these kids as lucky ; they 've found the perfect mentor			0
@entity1 has danced in several big @entity7 shows and a @entity12 halftime show and worked as a choreographer with the young dancers of the hit musical " @entity16 , " and now he 's written his first novel , " better @entity18			1
" despite his long day , an energetic @entity1 says , " i think i was always a kid with his head in the clouds , " which is appropriate since his book is about dreaming big			1
in his novel , @entity25 is a teenager who loves musical theater			0
feeling a bit like an outsider at school , he escapes small - town @entity31 and hops a bus to @entity34 , where he hopes to land a part in " @entity37 : the musical " and get back home before his parents find out			2
the story is full of humor , a positive message and some @entity7 insider moments			0
the book bears more than a passing resemblance to @entity1 's own life , but he says , " for legal purposes , enough is different that i do n't think my mom is going to sue me			1
" for @entity18 and for @entity1 , a love of musical theater is what sets them apart from their classmates , but it 's also their life - saver			1
" musicals felt like a place where i could express myself in a safe way , even if my feelings were a little bit too big for school or home			0
it was the one place i really felt like , there 's lights , there 's scenery , and finally everything around me feels as big as my dreams , " @entity1 said			1
whether it 's musical theater , sports or academics , @entity1 encourages young people to find that thing that makes them unique and hold on to it , because it could very well be their ticket to greatness and success as an adult			1
" i think so often when you 're a kid , we mellow out those more interesting edges in order to coast through middle school quietly			0
by the time you get to high school , you 're left asking , who the heck am i ? i would encourage kids to try and figure out the thing that sets you apart , not publicly but that you 're passionate about internally			0
" watch a video from @entity1 about his new novel , " @entity93 " @entity1 hopes readers find " @entity18 " especially relevant in a day where many kids who want to perform on stage are bullied or picked on for being different			1
" every time i think we 've gotten past the point where it 's weird to be a boy who performs , a girl who does n't quite fit in , i turn on the news , and i see another tragic story of a kid who could n't quite face what it felt to be alive amidst a group of kids who just did n't get them or would n't leave them alone			2
that tells me we can never have enough voices and mentors and stories			0
" while @entity1 ultimately made his @entity7 dreams come true , after 10 years performing on stage , he found himself closing in on his 30th birthday and feeling like he was stuck in a creative rut			1
he thought about writing a novel but was n't sure he was up to the challenge			0
it was his work as a choreographer on " @entity16 , " preparing young performers for a starring role on @entity7 , that helped him conquer his own fears			1
" here i was about to turn 30 , telling these kids to face their greatest fear and go out on stage for more than a thousand people who had all paid to see them play the title role in a @entity7 show , and i was n't facing my own fear , which was to try writing			2
" @entity1 made a vow a week before he turned 30 to write a novel			1
thirty days later , he had his first draft of " better @entity140			0
" he calls the day he finished the book " the best day of my life			2
" now critics are raving about " @entity18			2
" kids love it , and even adults are approaching @entity1			2
" adults are saying to me , ' oh , my gosh , i remember what it was like , ' and it 's actually inspired a few to say things like , ' i 'm going to take up racquetball again , ' random stuff that has nothing to do with musicals			0
" readers who are fans of tv shows like " @entity159 , " " @entity160 " and " @entity161 " might enjoy " better @entity140			0
" some may even read it looking for career tips			0
@entity1 says desire , talent and hard work are all part of the equation , but what he really wants readers to take away from his book is to dream big , be brave and hold on to hope			1
" it 's really about putting yourself out there			0
every time you leave the stage , you 're thinking , ' was that as good as i hoped it was , or was that as bad as i hope it was n't ? ' the amazing thing that every artist shares is , in a world where fear is huge , hope is just a little bit bigger			0
