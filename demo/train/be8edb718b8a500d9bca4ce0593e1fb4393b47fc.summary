-- is it possible to retire by 50 with an income under $ 60,000 ? @entity3 and @entity4 think so			1
@entity4 and @entity5 , who make a combined $ 56,000 per year , want to retire early with more than $ 2 million			1
married since 2005 , the young @entity7 couple is just starting out			0
@entity3 , 25 , works as a used car salesman , and @entity9 , 23 , works as a medical billing coder at a hospital			1
together they earn an annual $ 56,000 -- above the national average , yet still not exactly easy street in today 's economy			0
but with a little discipline , they think they can meet their goal of an early retirement			0
" i feel pretty comfortable with a target of a little over $ 2 million , " @entity3 says			1
it may sound ambitious , but the @entity23 have a plan : put roughly 10 % of their earnings toward retirement , 10 percent toward bills , 30 percent toward debt reduction , 15 percent into taxable mutual funds , and 35 percent to daily expenses and emergency savings			1
the @entity23 have a lot going for their finances			0
they 're young and have no kids yet			2
they live in @entity37 , @entity7 , an area that has one of the lowest costs of living in the country			2
and they 're aggressive investors for their age , currently putting $ 530 per month into stock - only mutual funds			2
" right now , i am really trying to build a strong foundation in our portfolio so that when children or anything else comes along , we are in a very strong position , " @entity3 said			1
but their financial picture is n't all rosy			2
like many @entity55 families , they 're saddled with credit card debt : about $ 4,500			1
but they continually roll their balances onto new zero percent @entity60 promotional credit cards to avoid paying interest			2
they plan on making steady payments of $ 100 a month and paying off their debt in less than four years			1
they bought a one - year - old used @entity66 for $ 19,000 about four months ago and put monthly payments of $ 330 toward the $ 17,500 left on the loan			0
@entity3 and @entity4 think they 'll be ready to start a family in about five years , but have n't yet started planning for kids			1
meanwhile , they 're working to pay off @entity4 's student loans , which total $ 5,500			1
for the more distant future , @entity3 maxes out his @entity75 , which currently stands at about $ 22,000			1
his job does n't offer a 401 ( k ) plan , but @entity4 has access to a company - sponsored plan through the hospital			1
she only contributes the 2 percent that her employer matches , but sometime in the near future she expects a promotion that could nearly double her salary			0
when her salary increases , she will also max out her retirement contribution			0
" we each have some room to grow based on income potential , " said @entity3 , who has fairly steady pay despite earning his entire salary on commission from car sales			1
@entity3 and @entity4 say their priority now is to replenish their emergency fund , which they recently depleted to pay down some debt , as the promotional period on one credit card was ending			1
they would like to get their savings up to about $ 10,000 , or six months of expenses			0
our expert 's take with their current plan , @entity3 and @entity4 are on their way to millionaire status , but maybe not as soon as they 'd like , according to @entity113 , a @entity114 with @entity115			1
she says that even with an aggressive 9 percent to 10 percent annual return on their investments , the @entity23 will be worth about $ 1.3 million at age 50 -- no small sum , but probably not enough to retire so young			1
and that 's at their current rate of savings , without any children in the picture			0
" kids are pretty expensive , " @entity113 points out			0
between higher costs and education savings , they might have to pull back on their aggressive saving once they have children			0
@entity113 believes that the @entity23 are smart to prioritize their emergency savings , which she recommends they keep in a money market fund with no stock exposure			0
" forget the funds for now , " @entity137 said			0
" especially with the market heading down , they have to build up their cash reserves first			0
" she also thinks the @entity23 are managing their debt well , but they should be wary of opening too many cards			2
" although they are moving their balances to new cards with zero percent interest , if they continue to open new cards to do this they are bringing their credit score down , " she said			2
" their credit score will take a hit for having cards that are maxed out , getting inquiry hits , and opening new cards			2
" to save up , she suggests the @entity23 cut into their monthly entertainment expenses			0
" @entity155 at home , or get movies from the library -- they 're free ! " said @entity113			2
but overall , @entity113 thinks @entity3 and @entity4 are in a good position , even if they ca n't retire by 50			1
" they 're doing pretty good , frankly			0
they did pretty well with their home , and it 's great that they 're saving so much			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

@entity3 and @entity4 hope ambitious financial plan will make them millions
their low cost of living helps ; credit card debt , student loans pose *obstacles*
expert says they 're on their way , but may not be able to retire by 50
