-- it 's a nerve - wracking week for the 20 young journalists of @entity4 's newest youth magazine			1
it 's nearly deadline day and the @entity8 office is a buzz of activity as the finishing touches are made to the first magazine aimed at the mainstream youth of @entity4			1
but it 's also a publication that 's been made entirely by the same people it 's targeting			2
" it 's not just them writing articles and then a professional team taking that and making it pretty , " said founder of @entity18 @entity4 , @entity19			1
" @entity24 has been commissioned by young people , subedited , designed and illustrated			1
we even have young people working on the circulation , distribution and marketing , " he added			1
but along with producing 48 - pages of news , views and entertainment the project is bringing together young people from a range of different backgrounds and races			1
the results are breaking boundaries and giving many of the youngsters an opportunity to realize their full potential , the founders say			0
one of the writers , @entity49 , has aspirations of one day working as a professional journalist			0
just a few years ago she was a member of a gang and spent time in prison			0
" she has tried to apply for college but is struggling to get in to school so we are giving her a platform to get in to school			0
we hope that the experience she gets here will push her into journalism , " explains @entity59 , @entity60			0
@entity60 says the magazine is also providing young people with a platform to speak out about issues that are affecting them			1
" it 's a place for them to communicate to other young people in their age group about the political situation , education system and discuss what culture they are interested in , " she said			1
she adds that a lot of the media in @entity4 is run by an older generation			1
" they did n't have places to do this before , there are blogs and social networking but internet is still not accessible to everyone so this is a good medium as the magazine will be distributed for free , " she continued			0
@entity49 is currently writing a story about an issue that the younger generation have been protesting about in the area			1
a child was beaten up at a school in @entity95 on the principal 's orders			0
@entity49 's piece about violence in schools hopes to give a voice to some of the concerns the younger generation have had with the incident			1
another writer is working on a ' dummies guide ' to the @entity108 youth leader , @entity107			0
there will also be articles reviewing products and advice and tips for school - leavers and young entrepreneurs			2
@entity117 youth find their superhero live magazine originated in the @entity121 and after a decade in business and a circulation of 30,000 the success of the quarterly publication prompted @entity19 to bring the concept to @entity4			2
@entity19 secured funding for the project from the @entity128 , a social innovation agency set up by @entity129 , a famous @entity4 entrepreneur			2
but the hope is for the magazine to become the authentic voice of @entity4 youth and be entirely self - sustainable within one to two years			1
the reporters are aged 18 - 25 and come from a range of different circumstances			1
@entity19 says the editor comes from one of the most dangerous townships in @entity8 and is working alongside youngsters who have had more privileged upbringings			2
the organization is also working with ' remote ' contributors in surrounding townships through regular workshops			0
however , despite the youngsters different backgrounds , the professional mentors that guide and train the youngsters report that a common theme unites them			0
" all the kids wanted to address the segregation in @entity8 , they all wanted to talk about that and use the magazine as a platform to discuss it , " said @entity60			2
another mentor , photographer @entity157 , has been honing the youngster 's camera skills			0
he says it 's been incredible hearing how everyone has interacted with each other			0
" the conversations they 've had while they are working in the same room have broken a lot of boundaries , " he said			0
" there is still a rift between many communities and people are still separated by language and cultures and this has really been a bridge to that , " he continued			0
" they sit in a room and talk about their different cultures and problems			0
it 's been a learning curve for us as well			0
" the first issue of @entity24 will hit the streets in mid-november across the @entity188 and @entity189			2
but @entity18 has future ambitions to take the concept to other parts of @entity4			1
" there are millions of young people out there who are hungry for this kind of opportunity , so it ca n't happen too fast ! " @entity19 said .			1
