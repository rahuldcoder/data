-- for most of my life , i 've had a relationship with @entity4 , mostly good , but which included a long period in which @entity4 hurt me and other foreign service officers greatly			1
i was the press @entity7 © at the @entity8 in @entity9 in 1979 , and one of 52 @entity10 held hostage for 444 days during the @entity12			2
i can not forgive the youthful @entity4 who imprisoned us and the regime that legitimized their cruelty , but i try to be as objective as possible as an observer of @entity4 's situation today			1
@entity4 's intransigence with its nuclear intentions and the @entity23 's efforts , led by the @entity10 , to undermine @entity4 's economy and , perhaps , its legitimacy , are moving both sides further from a war of words and closer to a hot war			1
this war would easily draw in @entity31 , and perhaps even some of the @entity33 nations that are showing their @entity35 side since the " @entity36			2
" it could well close the @entity38 and the drive the price of oil to impossible highs , prolonging a worldwide economic funk			0
and it would once again put the @entity10 front and center in a third protracted war since 2001			2
but , let 's not jump to conclusions that war is inevitable or react reflexively to @entity4 's saber - rattling , the way some of the @entity52 presidential candidates have been doing to score points on the campaign trail			1
they seem to think that this war would be surgical and quick			2
that 's the same bad thinking that got us into @entity60			0
i 'd rather step back a moment and focus on @entity4 's strained domestic political situation as the real reason for its confrontation with the @entity10 and the @entity23			1
while i do n't want to sound like an apologist for the authoritarian @entity67 , i also do n't want us to be @entity68 about what 's driving @entity4 intentions			1
first , @entity4 's " civilian " nuclear program reaches back to the pre-revolutionary days of the @entity72 , and there is no proof , whether from the @entity75 or the @entity10 , that @entity4 is actually building a bomb			1
second , it 's widely reported that @entity4 's supreme leader @entity77 and president @entity78 are in open conflict today , not only politically but also theologically			1
while this rift is esoteric to @entity81 , @entity9 takes it very seriously			0
it comes down to @entity78 trying to change the entire foundation of @entity4 's theological - political infrastructure by asserting that he , not @entity77 , has a direct relationship with the @entity86 , or messiah			1
@entity77 has responded by condemning @entity78 and his followers as the " deviant stream			0
" since may 2011 , this domestic conflict has shaken the regime 's stability			2
it may have much to do with @entity9 's flailing foreign policy as the sanctions do			0
the regime also has its hands full with upcoming parliamentary elections in march			1
it likes to say that the elections are both a model and inspiration for the new surge of democracy in the @entity33 world			0
it also sees these elections as a test of legitimacy			0
remember , only two years ago , @entity4 was convulsed with a popular uprising that opposed the outcome of presidential elections			1
the reform movement was brutally crushed by the regime thugs			0
major reformist leaders are still under house arrest			0
whether the regime is able to market itself to its neighbors as a legitimate source of a @entity122 revival is rather doubtful			0
more importantly , reformists have loudly and clearly stated that they are not going to participate in a rigged election			0
this will be the first time since the beginning of the @entity67 that any part of the electorate has bolted from the system			0
@entity77 must see this reformist move as a profound crack in his authority and to the regime 's legitimacy			0
finally , there are more domestic disasters			0
while @entity4 of all political stripes see a nuclear program as a national status symbol , they are paying a dear price for it			1
the sanctions are truly hurting the average @entity4			1
the hardships include high unemployment , inflation and commodity shortages			0
last week , @entity4 's currency fell to a new low against the dollar			1
this situation is not going to endear the regime to the electorate			0
can we move away from the precipice of war ? i think so			0
@entity160 members should get out of the public relations business and stop making pronouncements about @entity4 that are simplistic and belligerent			2
it makes any chance of a negotiated settlement even more difficult			0
the @entity167 's rescue of 13 @entity4 fishermen from pirates in the @entity170 was a surprising and awkward moment , and a chance for both sides to step back and breathe a little			2
but the startling news that @entity4 's @entity175 had sentenced an @entity10 , @entity176 , to death , charging him with spying for the @entity179 , says that @entity4 , once again , is up to the task of seeking revenge against the @entity10 we need to find a real structure for diplomacy to calm these new levels of tension			1
just as @entity187 is hosting a political office for the @entity189 in an attempt to open direct talks to an end the @entity194 war , a regional approach to @entity4 may help			1
@entity187 has become the dynamic center within the @entity197 and has been a respected go - between			1
yes , it has close relations with the @entity10 and hosts the headquarters of the @entity202 , but its prime minister , @entity203 , was not timid when he said in 2006 , " @entity187 talks to @entity4 as an equal , and this is important			1
" the @entity204 could play a greater role in softening @entity4 's relationship with the @entity208 @entity33 world by drawing it closer to its regional neighbors , as well as serving as a liaison between @entity4 and the @entity23			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those off @entity213 .			2

@entity213 , a former hostage in @entity4 , says war of words is turning into *threat* of war
he says despite saber - rattling and comments by @entity52 candidates , war not inevitable
he says regime flailing *due* to internal tensions , hard - hit economy , upcoming elections
@entity213 : *intermediaries* like @entity187 could *provide* structure for diplomacy to calm tensions
