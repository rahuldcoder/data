@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 scientists say they 've figured out the recipe for water in space : just add starlight			1
they made the discovery while examining a dying star that is 500 light - years away from @entity13 , using an infrared observatory launched by the @entity15 last year			2
" this is a good example of how better instruments can change our picture completely , " said @entity16 of the @entity17 in @entity18 , who is the lead author of the paper about the work			0
the story begins in 2001 , when astronomers discovered an unexpected cloud of water vapor around an old star called @entity30			1
the star is known as a carbon star , not thought to make much water , so scientists initially thought the star 's heat must have evaporated comets or dwarf planets to produce the water vapor			1
after the @entity15 's @entity40 laboratory launched last year , however , scientists discovered spectral lines in the light coming from the water vapor			1
" some of these lines can only be there if the temperature is high , otherwise we would n't see them , " said @entity43 , a project scientist for the @entity44			0
" none of them have been seen before			0
" those spectral lines gave scientists a vital clue : the water was hot , with temperatures as high as 800 degrees @entity58 ( nearly 1,500 degrees @entity57 )			1
that meant the water was too hot to have been formed by the destruction of icy celestial bodies , and had to have been formed much closer to the star than comets could stably exist			2
so if the water was n't the result of comets being blasted apart as they passed by , scientists wondered , where did it come from ? the water vapor sits in a dusty cloud surrounding @entity30			1
scientists deduced that ultraviolet light from surrounding stars had penetrated that dusty cloud , breaking up molecules in it like carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide , which in turn released oxygen atoms			1
those oxygen atoms attached themselves to hydrogen molecules , forming water			0
" the ultraviolet light did n't create it -- it helped it to be formed , " @entity43 told @entity2			1
ultraviolet light is the only way water could have been produced in such conditions , he said			2
@entity30 is a red giant star , hundreds of times the sun 's size , the @entity15 said			0
if it replaced the sun in our solar system , it would extend beyond the orbit of @entity95			0
the star is barely detectable at visible wavelengths because of that huge cloud of dust surrounding it			0
it can be seen at some infrared wavelengths , however , because the dust cloud absorbs almost all of the star 's visible radiation and re-emits it as infrared light			2
scientists now hope to observe other carbon stars			0
" we are very hopeful that @entity40 will find the same situations around those stars too , " @entity16 said .			0

spectral lines found in light from *distant* water vapor *provided* the clue
the lines revealed heat , @entity4 scientists say
the water likely was formed after the *action* of ultraviolet light on a dusty cloud , they say
