-- world number one @entity1 put her recent controversies to one side as she cruised past @entity5 of @entity6 6 - 1 6 - 3 in the first round at @entity8			1
worryingly for her opponents , the defending champion -- who won every point on her serve in the first set -- said she was n't at the top of her game despite winning her 32nd consecutive match			1
the run is the best since 2008 , when @entity20 's @entity19 achieved a similar number of straight wins			1
@entity1 is now just three wins away from the women 's record , which is something of a family affair after elder sister @entity27 recorded her 35th unbeaten game in 2000			1
the world @entity29 will break that record if she reaches the quarterfinals at a venue where she also won @entity35 gold last year			2
" i feel like i was a little rusty for some reason today , " @entity1 , who is bidding for a sixth @entity8 title , told reporters after a victory that took just 57 minutes			1
" i do n't feel like i played my best tennis			0
i felt really upset when i lost my serve at the beginning in the second set - that said , i think @entity5 played really well			2
" " to be honest , i 'm a little excited i was able to play a tough match and get through it			0
" the past week certainly has n't been as smooth as @entity1 would have liked after becoming embroiled in a row with @entity47 and having to defend comments made in an article that appeared in @entity51 magazine			1
the @entity52 has since apologized to the @entity53 after the article included a veiled reference to the latter 's relationship with @entity59 player @entity58 in addition to controversial comments about the rape of a 16 - year - old girl in @entity64			1
in reply , @entity47 made stinging comments about @entity1 ' own personal life , with the @entity52 romantically linked with her @entity69 coach @entity68 , who was courtside on monday			2
" i personally talked to @entity47 at the player party			0
i said ; ' look , i want to personally apologize to you if you are offended by being brought into my situation			0
i want to take this moment to just pour myself , be open , say i 'm very sorry for this whole situation ' , " @entity1 said on sunday			2
the 16 - time grand slam winner is in the form of her life at the age of 31 and may be reassessing how long she has left at the top following the feats of @entity81 , who @entity1 could meet in the third round			1
the 1996 semifinalist , who is just three months short of her 43rd birthday , beat an opponent who was just four when the @entity87 made her @entity8 debut in 1989			0
18 - year - old @entity90 qualifier @entity89 was no match for the veteran as date - @entity81 won 6 - 0 6 - 2 before revealing one of the secrets of her success			1
" i 'm taking care of my body , because of course the most difficult thing is recovery			0
but if i do too much , i feel tired , " she said			0
" i like @entity103 tea			0
i have a tea pot i always i carry			0
it 's here with me now			0
" in other highlights on tuesday , the home crowd had a match to savor on @entity112 as 19 - year - old @entity114 @entity113 knocked out tenth seed @entity115 , who made the quarterfinals last year			2
the world number 38 claimed a 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 win			2
" that was a big one for me just because of all the nerves and playing in front of your home crowd at @entity8 , " said @entity120 , who won @entity8 as a junior			0
elsewhere , @entity129 fourth seed @entity127 -- who finished runner - up to @entity1 last year - cruised past @entity133 qualifier @entity131 with a 6 - 1 6 - 1 victory .			1

defending champion @entity1 into second round with straight sets win
32nd straight win equals @entity19 's feat of 2007 - 2008
last year 's runner - up @entity127 drops just two games against @entity133 qualifier
