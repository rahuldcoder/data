-- in a video uploaded to @entity2 on saturday purportedly by the terrorist group @entity3 , various scenes of jihadist propaganda flash across the screen : militants reading verses from the @entity9 and examining a map of northern @entity11 , clips of violent clashes and explosions			1
but this video had something else in it that previous videos released by @entity3 have not : surveillance footage apparently shot by a drone			1
the almost 14 - minute video shows aerial views of @entity22 93 near @entity24 province in northern @entity11			0
@entity3 militants attacked the base on august 7 , deploying suicide bombers driving truck bombs to soften up resistance in scenes that are also shown in the videotape that was released saturday			0
the caption over the surveillance footage of the @entity22 military base reads : " from the drone of the army of the @entity37			0
" that @entity3 appears now to be using a relatively sophisticated surveillance drone to plan its military operations underlines an important development : technology that was once the monopoly of states is now being used by terrorist groups			1
in april , for example , the @entity46 military said it had shot down a drone off the coast of @entity50 and that it was operated by @entity51 , the militant @entity52 group operating out of @entity53			2
@entity51 denied responsibility for the drone , but had claimed earlier that it had operated another drone that had flown 35 miles into @entity46 in october			2
@entity57 , too , has drone capabilities			2
on july 14 , @entity46 shot down a @entity57 - operated drone that was flying in @entity46 airspace above @entity61 , a city in southern @entity46 , marking what is believed to be the first time the militant group had sent an unmanned aircraft into @entity46 territory			2
@entity57 then posted a video online that showed another drone , this one with four small rockets under its wings , flying over what analysts believe could also be @entity46 airspace			1
according to @entity57 , its military wing , the @entity75 , has engineered three different types of drones : ones for surveillance purposes ; ones that can be armed ; and ones that can operate as self - guided missiles -- a sort of " suicide drone			1
" @entity46 subsequently bombed what it claimed was a @entity57 - run drone facility in @entity87			0
@entity89 opposition fighters targeting @entity89 dictator @entity90 started using drones for surveillance during the summer of 2011 when they bought a @entity94 drone from a @entity96 company			0
the @entity89 opposition needed a way to survey its routes before sending rebels into areas where @entity90 's soldiers were stationed			0
the four - rotor helicopter that dangles a stabilized camera seemed like the perfect option			0
the drone cost between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 , according to an article by @entity108 for @entity109			0
armed drones have been deployed in combat by only three countries : the @entity113 , the @entity114 and @entity46			0
however , according to a count by the @entity117 , some 80 countries have some kind of drone capability , whether armed or unarmed			1
@entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 are among the nations that possess armed drones but have n't used them in combat that terrorist and militant organizations have acquired and used drones during combat operations for surveillance purposes shows how rapidly this technology is proliferating			1
this is why it is crucial to have some kind of international agreement that governs the use of armed drones by both states and " nonstate actors			0
" one could imagine the creation of some kind of @entity141 that specifies as a matter of international law when the use of armed drones could be sanctioned outside of conventional war zones to kill terrorists			1
such a convention would also help to prevent the sale or transfer of sophisticated drone technology to nonstate actors such as @entity3 .			1

@entity153 , @entity154 : video seems to show that @entity3 has surveillance drone
they say this *highlights* new *reality* : terrorist groups have technology once used by states
they say @entity51 says it has used them ; @entity57 says it has armed and unarmed drones
*writers* : some 80 nations now have drones . we need ' @entity141 ' to govern their use
