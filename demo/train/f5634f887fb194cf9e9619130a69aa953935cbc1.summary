@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the pinnacle of the @entity1 flat racing season , bringing together the best horses from around the country -- and even further afield -- to compete for a purse of more than $ 2 million			1
the annual @entity9 meeting has spawned many similar events around the world , among them the @entity13 , the @entity14 and , perhaps most famously , the @entity15			0
indeed , the name " @entity13 " has entered the vernacular and is now used to describe almost any race for three - year - olds			0
but the @entity20 is still the most venerable of them all			1
dating back to 1780 , the race is named after its founder , the 12th @entity23 , himself a prominent owner and breeder of racehorses			0
today it draws crowds of up to 200,000 people			0
but for one of that number , the @entity13 is more than just a race			0
the queen 's association with the @entity20 runs deep			1
she began attending the event as a princess			0
after her coronation in 1953 , the @entity13 was her first official engagement			0
it was nearly a fairly - tale beginning : the queen 's horse @entity41 should have claimed the honors but a massive bay colt named @entity46 had failed to read to the script			1
so there 's a certain symmetry to her decision to mark the beginning of her weekend of @entity53 with a visit to @entity55			1
interactive : a year in the life of the queen a familiar , if inscrutable , figure at track , the queen 's enthusiasm for racing is well - documented ( it 's even said in racing circles that her reading material of choice over her breakfast is the @entity68 )			1
she is also one of the @entity70 's best - known owners and breeders of racehorses , with about 30 horses currently in training			1
@entity76 - based trainer @entity75 is one of a handful of trainers entrusted with ensuring the queen 's horses are kept in peak physical condition			1
he currently has three horses in training for the queen : " she is a very well - informed and keen owner , probably the best - informed owner in the country			1
" " she adores breeding racehorses , " says her racing manager , @entity86			1
" as a consequence the @entity13 is the most special thing because it combines all that everyone knows about racing , into this one particular race			2
the @entity70 bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the queen			2
" but despite this , the @entity20 remains the only one of the @entity1 " classics " ( a series of three - year - old races comprising the @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and the @entity13 ) that she has not won			1
read more : the young queen who grew into a modern monarch you have to go back to 1909 to find the last time a @entity13 winner was owned ( in this case leased ) by a reigning monarch ; that was @entity114 , owned by @entity115 ( although omen - watchers may note that as @entity117 he had success in 1900 with the portentously - named @entity119 )			1
the queen herself has come tantalizingly close			2
in ten attempts , her best placing has been second ( in the year of her coronation )			0
but perhaps her best chance to capture the @entity13 came last year with @entity126			0
the story of how the son of @entity131 " super sire " @entity128 came to be in the queen 's possession bears retelling : @entity136 's ruler , @entity135 , himself one of the world 's biggest racing enthusiasts , approached the queen to purchase one of her horses , @entity143 , to join his stables in @entity136			1
after an auspicious start to his racing career , the horse had then heaped shame on his illustrious owner when he refused to enter the starting gates for a big race at @entity154			2
in recognition of his volatile temperament , the queen refused to accept any payment for @entity143 and let the @entity160 have him for free			2
interactive : the queen in numbers the grateful @entity160 wanted to repay the queen 's gesture and later that summer sent word that had hand - picked four yearlings from his own breeding program which he intended to gift to the queen			2
one of those was @entity126			0
the colt started that year 's @entity13 as the red - hot favourite , buoyed by a wave of public support for the prospect of a first win in the country 's @entity179 for the queen			2
unfortunately , bad luck in running and the loss of a shoe conspired to relegate him to third , behind an exuberant @entity187 on @entity188			0
although the queen 's reaction went unrecorded , it 's hard to avoid the conclusion that @entity126 represented an unrepeatable chance for her majesty to lay her hands on the one piece of silverware that has eluded her for six decades			0
by all indications , however , the disappointment of last year has not dampened her enthusiasm for the event			0
so although the queen 's red and purple silks wo n't be seen on any of the runners entered in this year 's @entity13 , whether it 's the @entity209 - trained @entity208 or @entity75 's mercurial colt @entity211 who joins the ranks of the immortals , one thing is certain : there will be one fan on @entity217 cheering louder than them all .			0

the queen starts the *jubilee* weekend with a visit to the @entity20
a racing enthusiast , the queen has around 30 horses currently in training
last time a derby winner was owned by a reigning monarch was in 1909
