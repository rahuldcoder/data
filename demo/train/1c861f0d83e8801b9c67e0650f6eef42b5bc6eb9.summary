editor 's note : @entity2 is chief executive officer of the @entity3 , a nonprofit professional association which describes itself as an independent forum for examining issues related to the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
he spent 31 years in the military , rising to major general of @entity7 and , in his last assignment , serving as commander , @entity13			2
retired major general @entity2 says the @entity14 should attack the pirates at their bases			1
( @entity17 ) -- it is well past time to take a serious look at piracy off the coast of @entity22			2
initially , the @entity14 ignored the threat , and when public outcry about our seeming indifference became louder , we formed a combined task force of international navies in the @entity29 under command of a @entity6 rear admiral to " deter , disrupt and thwart " the pirates			1
today , it is clear that initiative has failed			2
in fact , this bit of muscle - flexing did so little to intimidate pirates operating out of @entity39 that they have actually increased the number of attacks in the last month			1
significant among those attacks , pirates on wednesday boarded and temporarily held a @entity14 - flagged vessel , the container ship @entity45			1
the @entity14 crew and its captain retook the vessel , but at the price of the captain becoming a hostage to the four pirates in one of the @entity45 's lifeboats			1
several hours later a @entity14 warship , the @entity57 destroyer @entity58 , arrived on scene and , as i write , the standoff with the pirates continues			1
what an embarrassing and frustrating event ! a bunch of maritime thugs brazenly seized a vessel flying the flag of the nation with the most powerful navy the world has ever known			0
the fault does not lie with the ships and sailors of @entity75			0
they have been given the proverbial mission impossible -- stop pirate attacks in an area four times the size of @entity81 with only three @entity6 ships and a total of 12 to 15 allied / friendly warships			0
not gon na happen ! but embarrassment aside , there is real potential for loss of life and for continued attacks on vessels plying these waters			0
the issue is simple but difficult -- how do we eliminate the pirate threat ? strangely , we seem unable to learn from our own history			0
in 1804 president @entity97 said " enough " to paying 20 percent of the @entity14 national budget as tribute to barbary pirates			1
his response was clear and successful -- build a strong naval task force , equip it with a sizeable contingent of @entity7 , and send it to attack and defeat the pirates in their lair			1
the sailors and @entity7 sent on that mission did just that -- and in the process wrote a stirring page in our nation 's early history			0
the problem today is that we have refused to take the @entity97 model			2
we 've confined our anti-piracy efforts to the open seas and left the pirates ' home bases on land as a sanctuary			2
thus , the pirates continue to operate with relative freedom and stealth			0
we and our allies only respond , never seizing the initiative			0
the @entity97 model is a better answer : take on the pirates where they are , rather than guessing where they will be			1
in short , attack them at their home bases			2
there is where they plan and prepare for raids on vessels			0
there is where they arrange ransom for held ships and crew members			0
from these bases , pirates are free to conduct raids without fear of reprisal , let alone interference from organized justice			2
they are free to venture out to prey upon one of the 33,000 ships that pass near their coast each year , knowing that they can return to the absolute security of their land bases and enjoy their spoils			0
it is time to change strategy and take the fight to the pirates , as our military predecessors did with great success more than 200 years ago			1
in the 21st century , anti-piracy measures should ideally be the responsibility of local and regional law enforcement			0
unfortunately , the non-functioning government of @entity39 is unable to bring police or military forces to bear against criminal piracy launched from its own territory			1
the predicament has done much to foster piracy , greatly growing the number of pirates and further encouraging their lawless behavior			2
they are well aware that the rewards of their activities far exceed the risks			0
with the potential to make millions of dollars through extortion , the @entity39 - based pirates take comfort in having no fear of being arrested in their homes for their crimes , and obviously have little fear of being caught on the high seas despite the presence of the combined task force			1
of course , attacking pirate land bases in @entity39 as the @entity14 did against the barbary pirates in @entity199 two centuries ago is not a simple proposition			1
even without a functioning government present in @entity39 , the @entity14 and other countries whose ships are threatened are not free to conduct military operations on @entity39 soil at will			1
there are many complicated legal issues concerning sovereignty and laws of armed conflict that need to be thought through before any real action can be initiated			0
however , these issues must be explored so that the option of a more forceful policy can be duly considered			0
ireport.com : how should the @entity14 respond ? some may argue that the destruction of the ships and bases of pirates is merely attacking the symptom without curing the disease			1
they believe that piracy can not be defeated until its causes are sufficiently addressed			0
these causes are usually identified as abysmal economic conditions and the lack of a strong national infrastructure			0
previous attempts to undertake larger scale law - and - order projects in @entity39 , however , have resulted in a tragedy now memorialized in the national psyche simply as @entity235			2
hence my argument for consideration of smaller - scale actions targeted specifically against the criminal pirates			0
retaliatory and preemptive strikes on known bases are certainly not the only options in dealing with the @entity39 pirates , but current policy has already proven to be fairly futile in dissuading attacks			1
ireport.com : ' stop the pirates , @entity249 ! ' those who desire to combat piracy by bringing stability to @entity39 must accept that the noble effort will take several years , potentially leaving thousands of ships vulnerable to attack in the meantime			1
one thing is for certain : allowing the pirates to have sanctuary while also giving them a clear advantage in the rules of engagement is not going to stop their activities any time soon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : pirates based in @entity39 represent threat to crews and cargo
he says @entity14 strategy so far has failed to deter piracy
@entity2 : we should follow example set 200 years ago by @entity97
he says the @entity14 needs to attack the pirates at their bases
