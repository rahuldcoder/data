-- not even a week after the ruling in the @entity4 trial , president @entity1 could n't wait to stand before the @entity6 press corps and " speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention , " as he said last july			1
yet it took @entity1 more than a month to address the crisis where 40 veterans allegedly died while waiting months for treatment at a @entity15			1
@entity16 has held hearings on the grave matter since april and called @entity20 secretary @entity19 among other witnesses to testify			2
but @entity1 just got around to holding a press conference wednesday on the topic			2
" so when i heard allegations of misconduct -- any misconduct , whether it 's allegations of @entity20 staff covering up long wait times or cooking the books -- i will not stand for it , not as commander in chief , but also not as an @entity33 , " @entity1 declared			1
if @entity1 is as outraged and " mad as hell " as he professes , why did it take him over a month to say anything substantive about vets dying because of months waiting for care ? prior to his long overdue press conference about the @entity20 controversy , @entity1 only mentioned what has now become another @entity6 scandal in a response to a question from a reporter on april 28 during his @entity47 trip			1
during his press conference , @entity1 said he was n't going to jump to any conclusions or call for any resignations until " the investigators do their job and get to the bottom of what happened " at the @entity20			1
he added , " we have to find out , first of all , what exactly happened			0
" in contrast , @entity1 could n't wait to jump to conclusions and comment on the shooting of the black teen @entity4 by @entity60 before any investigation or trial happened			1
@entity1 made extensive comments on the shooting in march 2012 in the @entity65			2
" you know , if i had a son , he 'd look like @entity4			2
all of us as @entity33 are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves , " he said			0
well we certainly did n't hear the president say , if he had served in the military , " i could have been one of those veterans who died			0
" apparently , veterans , who put their lives at risk defending our country then died at the hands of incompetent @entity20 employees are n't worthy of the same attention and " seriousness " as @entity4 ? even more indicative of the @entity1 @entity6 's misplaced priorities is the @entity6 issued a statement from the president on the day of the @entity88 trial verdict last july			1
no @entity6 statement was issued about the @entity20 allegations			1
but clearly a statement on the @entity4 trial was n't enough			2
a few days later , @entity1 held a press conference about the verdict			2
" i thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit , " @entity1 noted			0
@entity4 's death , though tragic , had nothing to do with national security or government malfeasance and did n't warrant attention from the president of the @entity33			1
but @entity1 felt it was very important to comment on the death of a young black man shot by a " white @entity107 " to appease race hucksters like @entity109 and @entity110 who helped elect him			0
stammering throughout his @entity20 press conference wednesday , @entity1 told reporters " responsibility for things always rests ultimately with me , as the president and commander in chief			1
" at the same time @entity1 claims he did n't know how big the problems were with the @entity20			1
how can a president be responsible for problems occurring at agencies if he 's not aware of the problems ? this sounds like the all - too - familiar refrain the @entity6 uses			0
it did n't know about the @entity126 scandal or the @entity128 ' disastrous rollout of @entity129			0
again , @entity1 promised , " there is going to be accountability			0
" " listen , if somebody has mismanaged or engaged in misconduct , not only do i not want them getting bonuses , i want them punished , " he said from the @entity6 briefing room			0
hopefully this time , the president means what he says because in past scandals he has held no one accountable			0
@entity126 division director @entity141 and @entity128 secretary @entity142 both were allowed to resign without accountability			0
@entity19 eventually will do the same			0
regardless of the outcome of the investigation , at minimum our veterans deserve the same attention to their deaths as @entity1 gave @entity4			1
join us on @entity151 / @entity150 .			0

@entity153 wonders why @entity1 's @entity20 reaction was n't as *swift* as his @entity4 comments
@entity1 waited more than a month to speak on @entity20 allegations
in *comparison* , he commented a week after the @entity4 verdict
@entity162 : our veterans deserve the same attention to their deaths as @entity1 gave @entity4
