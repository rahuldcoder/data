@entity0 i did n't want to ask the question			1
i could already guess the pain behind the answer			2
" do you think your husband is dead ? " her mouth twists , contorting her young face , tears welling in her already reddened eyes			2
" i do n't know ... i pray to @entity13 to give him another chance , " she finally manages to stutter			1
her sadness is heavy and blankets both of us			2
she tells me she has three children , and they last saw their father four months ago when he went back to his army unit on the front line in @entity0 's battle with the radical @entity24 extremist group @entity23			1
satellite images show devastation of @entity23 attacks , rights groups say his friends last saw him bloodied and shooting as @entity23 fighters advanced and they all fled			1
if all this was n't trauma enough , the young woman says the army has deserted her , too			1
" they did n't tell me anything , they still have n't told me what happened and they did n't pay me anything and no one is feeding us in the barracks , " she said			1
we are in northern @entity0 , a few hours ' drive north of the capital where the mostly @entity48 north meets the mostly @entity50 south			2
just last month , a double suicide bombing killed 12 people in a busy central market in the region			0
driving northeast of here toward the borders with @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 puts you in the heart of @entity23 territory -- a land mass the size of @entity65			1
so it 's no surprise that the area is home to many thousands of troops , and , as i am finding out , it 's also the backdrop of many more heart - wrenching stories			1
a mile or so from his base , i meet a soldier on a remote windswept hill			0
he is a veteran of @entity80 and @entity82 peacekeeping missions in @entity83 and @entity84 , a professional soldier			0
we sit on plastic chairs as he tells me his story			0
he , too , was left on the battlefield by his comrades as they fled for safety in the face of a @entity23 attack			1
he does n't blame them			2
" the major problem the soldiers have is they do n't have the equipment to fight , " he says			1
@entity23 has anti-aircraft guns , which he says are accurate up to three - quarters of a mile			1
all the @entity101 military has , he says , are @entity103 small machine guns , accurate up to a few hundred meters			1
often the @entity101 soldiers are given only 60 bullets each , so they quickly run out			1
@entity23 , he says , has large supplies of ammunition and more fighters			1
although the @entity101 soldiers do win some fights , he says they are regularly forced to turn tail and run for their lives by the sheer volume of gunfire from @entity23 fighters			1
it took him three days -- on foot , alone -- to get back to his base , 70 kilometers away			0
when he arrived , his wife told him to quit the army , but his troubles were only just beginning			0
@entity122 medics refused to pay the $ 200 for medicine to treat his injuries			0
morale in the army is sinking , he says			0
that night , i meet a young officer , who , like the other soldier , is not authorized to talk to me			0
our conversation is held in a hurry in a tiny darkened hut that sells biscuits and fizzy drinks at a roundabout on the outskirts of a town			0
corruption , he tells me , is the root of the @entity101 military 's problem			1
" not just the generals ... everybody in the country wants to get rich by any means necessary , " he says			0
the soldiers do n't ever benefit from the billions allocated to the defense budget , he explains			1
he even had to buy his own uniform			2
" the troop morale is actually very low , very low , because we are not issued a uniform , we buy the uniforms ourselves , " he explained			1
the other soldier i met on the hill told me this , too			0
when they go into battle , no one has the same uniform , so when they run from @entity23 it 's chaos			1
they do n't know who is friend or foe -- whom to shoot and whom to help			2
most soldiers live in fear , the young officer tells me			2
a fear of what will happen to them , and how long they can survive in this battle , he says			0
the worrying does n't stop there			2
they see enough war widows on the base to know the grim reality of what can happen to their loved ones if they die			0
a widow i meet explains			0
her husband was killed in battle over a year ago , she tells me			0
" when my husband died , they never called me to tell me that i lost my husband , " she says			0
" they buried him without notifying me			0
" she gets no army pension , and she says there are many more like her : they feel abandoned , afraid to speak out because they still live in the barracks			0
government officials tell us they will look into these shortcomings , that they are working on getting better weapons for the troops			0
if they do , according to the soldiers i met , it will easily turn the tide in this war			2
@entity101 president in @entity23 territory , spokesman says			1

some military families still do n't know what 's happened to their husbands , fathers
the @entity101 military seems under - equipped *compared* to @entity23 fighters
@entity101 soldiers must buy their own uniforms
