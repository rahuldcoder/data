@entity0 , @entity1 -- you expect a motorist to shell out a little extra cash for a vanity license plate			1
number 5 fetched $ 6.75 million , now the @entity1 is likely to set another record			1
but nowhere is the craze for a unique plate more intense than in the @entity1 , the oil - rich @entity12 nation that holds the world record for the six most expensive plates			1
here , it 's all about how low you can go -- with people battling it out at auctions to win the chance to show off license plates with the lowest digit			2
the numbers " 5 " and " 7 " have already been snapped up , sold for 25 million dirhams ( $ 6.75 million ) and 11 million dirhams ( $ 2.97 million ) respectively			1
next week , the country will put up for auction the mother of all vanity plates : the number " 1			1
" it is expected to immediately set a new record for the most expensive plate in the world			1
" as low as the number goes , as high the price goes also , " said @entity33 , who runs the license plate auctions in the capital city , @entity0			1
" if it 's a two - digit number , if it 's similar like ' 99 ' or ' 22 , ' that goes ( for ) a higher amount			2
" it 's no surprise that license plate craze has such a grip on the @entity1			1
the tiny nation , slightly smaller than the @entity46 state of @entity47 , is prone to thinking big			2
it is already home to the world 's largest mall , the world 's largest tower , and -- despite being in the @entity54 -- boasts the largest indoor snow park in the world			0
@entity57 , a stock broker in @entity0 , is the proud owner of " 5 " and " 7			1
" he sheepishly admits that yes , it 's a status thing			0
the license plate " 5 " hangs from his shiny red @entity61			2
an expensive car , but still , 10 times less so than the plate itself			0
it 's not all ego though			0
the money that the government raises auctioning off plates goes to a fund that helps victims of car accidents			0
@entity0 has held five such auctions , selling 300 plates and raising an astonishing $ 56 million			1
for the business savvy , there 's an added attraction : it 's a good investment			0
" i have a number plate on my car , which was worth 35,000 ( dirhams ) four years ago , " @entity33 said			2
" and i have an offer now for 400,000			0
" @entity57 has his eyes set on snagging the number " 1 , " but he is being practical about how much he is willing to spend			0
" um , i ( will ) not pay more than , maximum 15 ( to ) 20 , " he said			0
fifteen to 20 million ? " yes , " he said , seriously			0
