training medical professionals is just one of the many workplace uses @entity4 is experimenting with			1
earlier this year , @entity19 launched its glass at @entity20 , in which it collaborates with businesses interested in using @entity4 to improve productivity and save money			1
ten companies have signed on so far			2
@entity19 's head - mounted computer is almost two years old , but the product is still officially in beta			0
@entity4 was originally marketed only as a consumer device , but it has had difficulty finding a niche in the consumer market , where it struggled with privacy , etiquette and safety issues			1
but then some of @entity4 ' early adopters put the wearable to work , using the device to make their jobs more efficient			1
some of the most exciting potential for wearables is in the health industry , where workers need to keep their hands sterile			2
the small screen mounted on @entity4 can be used to display checklists or vital signs			1
smart glasses can also let specialists consult on cases far from their hospital			0
this type of telemedicine has been around for years , but high costs and regulation have made widespread adoption difficult			0
" having the units like @entity4 or any sort of wearable first - person display that comes in at less than $ 1,500 really opens things up , " said dr. @entity58 , who heads up the @entity4 tests at the @entity60			1
@entity60 is partnering with app developer @entity65 , a @entity4 partner , to experiment with @entity4 in a number of case studies			1

later , the students are shown the video to see themselves though a patient 's eyes , with the idea of improving bedside manner , empathy and listening skills			0
@entity19 is being slow and deliberate with the business partners it certifies			0
it vets each company to see if its specific use case solves a problem in the real world , and gives them access to technical experts			2
for now , the company is focusing on workers who need to use their hands for their jobs , everyone from nurses and surgeons to mechanics , utility workers and chefs			0
@entity19 says 80 % of the global workforce does physical work every day			0
" these are people who ca n't reach into their pocket to pull out a cell phone , they ca n't type on a laptop , " said @entity110 , head of business for @entity4			1
" they have every need to access information , every need to use tech to make their jobs that much more safe and productive			0
" when an expensive printer breaks down , an expert is typically sent to make repairs in person			0
in another @entity4 test case , @entity127 is experimenting with keeping the experts at home			1
instead , a customer puts on a pair of @entity4 and the repair person walks them through the necessary fixes remotely			1
wearables in the workplace are still in the very early stages			2
@entity19 and other similar companies are primarily focused on test cases and proving that there is a tangible benefit to the technology			2
before smart glasses go mainstream , there are also a number of issues that need to be addressed , including getting old industries up to date with new technology , bringing fast internet coverage to industrial work locations , and improving device battery life			0
and of course , privacy concerns wo n't disappear once a wearable is worn to work instead of to a bar			0
employees might have concerns about being monitored and tracked on the job with wearables			2
@entity19 has the time and resources to tackle these issues as they come up			0
down the line , wearables like @entity4 could be commonplace on oil rigs , in the exam room , up telephone towers and even in fast food restaurants			1
@entity171 is considering using @entity4 to train new employees on the proper cheese - to - bean ratios			1
@entity174 , the parent company of @entity171 and @entity175 , has worked with @entity4 app developer @entity176 on test cases to see if @entity4 can cut down on the time it takes to train new employees			1
@entity4 uses location information and a specific training app to walk them through the steps for preparing food in real time			2
" they 're not just reading a book about making tacos , they 're actually doing it			0
