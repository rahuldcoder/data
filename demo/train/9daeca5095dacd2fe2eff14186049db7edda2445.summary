@entity0 -- republicans and outside groups used anonymous @entity4 accounts to share internal polling data ahead of the midterm elections , @entity1 has learned , a practice that raises questions about whether they violated campaign finance laws that prohibit coordination			1
the @entity4 accounts were hidden in plain sight			1
the profiles were publicly available but meaningless without knowledge of how to find them and decode the information , according to a source with knowledge of the activities			0
the practice is the latest effort in the quest by political operatives to exploit the murky world of campaign finance laws at a time when limits on spending in politics are eroding and regulators are being defanged			1
the law says that outside groups , such as super pacs and non-profits , can spend freely on political causes as long as they do n't coordinate their plans with campaigns			2
sharing costly internal polls in private , for instance , could signal to the campaign committees where to focus precious time and resources			2
the groups behind the operation had a sense of humor about what they were doing			0
one @entity4 account was named after @entity50 , a fictional character in @entity51 who pressed his colleagues to use ethically questionable " soft money " to fund campaigns			1
a typical tweet read : " ca - 40/43 - 44/49 - 44/44 - 50/36 - 44/49 - 10/16/14 - 52 -- > 49/476 - 10s			0
" the source said posts like that -- which would look like gibberish to most people -- represented polling data for various @entity63 races			1
posting the information on @entity4 , which is technically public , could provide a convenient loophole to the law â € ” or could run afoul of it			2
" it 's a line that has not been defined			0
this is really on the cutting edge , " said @entity69 , senior counsel at the @entity70 , a nonpartisan organization focused on campaign finance issues			0
" it might not be legal			0
it 's a cutting edge practice that , to my knowledge , the @entity77 has never before addressed to explicitly determine its legality or permissibility			2
" at least two outside groups and a @entity84 campaign committee had access to the information posted to the accounts , according to the source			1
they include @entity90 , the super pac founded by @entity91 ; @entity92 , a nonprofit advocacy group , and the @entity94 , which is the campaign arm for the @entity63 @entity84			2
accounts deleted the accounts that @entity1 reviewed were active in the months ahead of this month 's election , which gave @entity84 their largest majority in the @entity63 since @entity100 and control of the @entity102			1
they were live until nov. 3 but deleted minutes after @entity1 contacted the @entity94 with questions			0
representatives for @entity90 , @entity92 and the @entity94 declined repeated requests for comment for this story			0
@entity1 captured screenshots of the @entity4 communications before contacting the parties involved			2
@entity90 dropped $ 21.6 million during the most recent election cycle , according to the @entity113			0
the @entity92 , meanwhile , spent nearly $ 9 million on federal elections in 2014			0
it 's difficult to determine whether @entity4 posts prompted ad buys or other spending in specific races			2
two of the profiles were named @ @entity122 and @ brunogianelli44 but it 's unclear which group used specific accounts			0
still , the tweeting through special code could raise questions about whether the groups illegally coordinated , according to @entity131 , a former head of the @entity77 enforcement division who now advises @entity134 and @entity84 on campaign finance issues			1
' decoder ring ' " if it truly requires some sort of @entity141 decoder ring to make heads or tails of the information , then there certainly is the possibility that there was some pre-arrangement , " @entity131 said			0
" just making it public is not enough			0
you have to further meet the requirement of no pre-arrangement or coordination			0
but it is the burden of the government to demonstrate that			0
" beyond coordination , the social media operation could also raise questions about whether the polling data contained in the tweets constituted a donation to the @entity94 that should have been reported			1
the groups could have violated election rules by not reporting the information in the tweets as a donation			1
the tweets captured by screenshots stretched back to july , but the groups have communicated in this manner for four years , the source said			0
staffers for each group deleted individual tweets every few months , so only the past few months of data were available when @entity1 first viewed the @entity4 accounts			1
the social media strategy is n't the first time parties and outside groups have used @entity4 to communicate			1
in april , it was @entity84 who accused @entity134 of attempting to " subvert campaign finance laws " when the @entity183 's official @entity4 accounts posted messages that @entity183 super pacs later incorporated into their ads. and both parties are working hard to find ways to work more closely with well - financed outside groups			1
earlier this year , for instance , the @entity190 reported that sen. @entity192 , a @entity194 @entity193 , posted what appear to be ad scripts on her websites that @entity84 say telegraphed messages the campaign would like to see on the air			2
in the @entity102 race this year , @entity84 @entity202 ' campaign posted a detailed memo on its website specifically laying out its needs for television and digital ad buys			2
meanwhile , outside groups also share details of their plans by releasing spending plans to the media or posting the information on their websites as press releases			0
but the @entity4 accounts in this case are unique in that they did not publicly identify their association with the groups who posted to them or advertise their existence			1
@entity224 the @entity4 operation underscores the uncertain state of campaign finance rules after the @entity230 's @entity229 decision upended limits on outside spending in politics			1
regulations provided by the @entity77 in the wake of the court ruling leave much to interpretation about what constitutes " coordination , " creating a @entity240 environment that , according to campaign finance experts , gives outside groups ample opportunity to share information while arguing they stayed within the confines of the law			1
" it may bend common sense , but not necessarily the law , " said @entity249 , a professor of @entity250 at @entity251 who co-authored a study this year examining the relationship between outside groups and campaigns			2
" a lot of things you and i would consider coordination are not coordination under the law			0
i do n't think sharing polling data is going to be enough to establish that the campaign was materially involved in decisions about content , target audience or timing			1
" in response to this story monday , @entity77 vice-chair @entity272 said the commission may address the use of social media to share campaign information , but conceded that the rules governing campaign finance are " murky			1
" the strategy , @entity281 wrote on @entity4 , " shows that tech changing politics ... but coordination rules sadly murky			1
" the practice also serves as another reminder of @entity0 's revolving door between campaign committees , party leadership and outside groups			0
the spokesman for @entity90 , @entity293 , and the president of @entity92 , @entity295 , both formerly worked at the @entity94 though there 's no evidence that they were involved in the @entity4 posts			2
despite the questionable nature of the @entity4 communications , experts doubt the @entity77 will do much to act			1
members of the commission have been deadlocked along party lines for years and attorneys for these groups often develop legal arguments before engaging in such practices to avoid acting outside the bounds of the law , @entity69 said			0
" in many instances , we have very sophisticated political players with really good lawyers who know where the legal lines are and know where to push them to their client 's advantage , " he said .			0
