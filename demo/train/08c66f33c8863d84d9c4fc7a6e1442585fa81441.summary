-- a 12 meter yacht bobbing off the coast of @entity3 is about to be blown to smithereens			1
or at least , that 's the plan			0
in a scene reminiscent of a @entity9 film , the boat is slowly filled with gas while a sailor in a nearby vessel holds his finger over the detonator , ready to blow the floating target sky high			0
these are n't undercover spies , but sailing experts undertaking a controlled explosion as part of a series of ground - breaking experiments into nautical safety			1
over eight months , the team from @entity26 magazine @entity25 , took one boat and sank it , capsized it , ran it aground , set it on fire , and finally blew it up -- all in the name of safety			1
their " @entity31 " series recreated eight nautical disasters -- ranging from a leaking hull to a dismasted sailboat -- to find the best methods for preventing and dealing with them			1
from january 2013 the incidents will be documented together for the first time in a new book titled , aptly enough , " @entity40			1
" the results featured in the book have turned much conventional sailing wisdom on its head and earned praise from both safety experts and readers across the world			1
" these are rare situations and when they do happen , people are n't in a position to test every method for dealing with it , " yachting monthly technical editor , @entity53 , told @entity0			0
" for example , if your mast breaks off , the age - old answer was to use bolt croppers to cut away the rigging and prevent more damage			1
" but we found that hanging over the edge of the boat while it 's rocking around like a fairground ride , with both hands on the croppers , was n't practical			0
a simple hacksaw , which you could use with one hand , was much more effective			0
" @entity71 , sailing accident investigator at the @entity72 , said recreating sailing disasters to such minute detail had never been done before			0
" being able to monitor the effects and test a range of responses was invaluable , " he added			0
the crash test boat series was first floated as @entity53 and fellow sailing enthusiasts mulled over enduring maritime questions such as : ' what would you do if your mast fell over ? ' or ' how would you survive in a capsized boat ? ' " we wanted to take theses problems and deal with them in real life , " he said			1
each experiment was modeled on real - life disasters , such as the @entity90 in which storms in the @entity92 capsized many of the competing yachts , resulting in 15 deaths			1
the series ended quite literally with a bang , in an impressive gas explosion			2
though it very nearly did n't get off the ground to begin with			2
" the authorities were telling us that a gas explosion was too dangerous , that we were crazy , " former @entity25 editor @entity101 said			0
" we were considering everything -- traveling the 12 mile ( 19 kilometer ) limit into international waters to escape the rules , even using a special effects expert from the @entity111 films to simulate an explosion			1
" after finally gaining permission to carry out the explosion , the boat was anchored in a 200 meter exclusion zone and @entity117 explosives experts were enlisted to set up the blast			1
but after an anxious 25 minute wait , the flash igniters set up around the leaking gas pipe failed to go off			2
deflated but still determined , the team vowed to give it one last shot			2
this time , the explosion was detonated by a wireless trigger -- and it did n't disappoint			1
" there was a brief orange fireball followed by the explosion			0
a hundred pieces of debris were hurled skywards amidst a plume of smoke , " says the report in the book			2
" the scale of the carnage was clear -- the entire coach roof had been blasted off the hull			2
" for the team , the explosion was also a thrilling chance to live out a few @entity9 - style fantasies , as @entity101 said : " how many people get to blow up a 40 foot ( yacht ) as part of their job -- and all in the name of safety ? " now a battered mess , the @entity31 continues to educate the public , exhibited at boating shows across @entity26 and used as a teaching aid at the @entity153 in @entity154			1
" a bit like the equivalent of a dead body in an anatomy class , " @entity101 explained			0
@entity53 says the boat 's greatest gift was showing sailors that " you really can rely on yourself			0
" " all the situations are recoverable			0
your boat wo n't sink if there 's hole in it			0
if your mast falls down you can still row to shore			0
the real importance of these tests was getting definitive answers in situations where people might normally panic			2
