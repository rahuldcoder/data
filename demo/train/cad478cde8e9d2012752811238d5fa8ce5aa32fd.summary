-- @entity2 president @entity1 said saturday that a suicide bombing targeting the country 's spy chief was planned in the @entity7 city of @entity8 , and that he expects to raise the issue with @entity7 authorities			1
the attack occurred thursday in one of the intelligence agency 's guesthouses in @entity16 , seriously injuring @entity17 -- who is expected to recover -- while leaving others wounded or dead , officials said			1
the @entity19 claimed responsibility for the bombing , but @entity1 says he believes otherwise			1
" the reality is that such a complicated attack and a bomb that was hidden inside his body , this is not the work of the @entity19 , " he told reporters			2
" it 's a completely professional and thoroughly engineered type of attack			0
the @entity19 are not capable of that , and therefore there are bigger and professional hands involved in this			0
" we will be seeking a lot of clarifications from @entity7 , " @entity1 said , though he avoided blaming @entity7 directly and pledged that it would not derail the peace process			1
@entity41 border raids from @entity7 into @entity2 and accusations that @entity7 intelligence support @entity2 insurgents have long fueled discontent between the two nations			2
but @entity7 is also considered a key regional power broker needed to settle the more than decade - long @entity2 conflict , particularly as @entity50 's 2014 withdrawal nears			2
while it remains unclear how the bomber smuggled the explosive device into what is expected to be a high - security location , thursday 's strike highlights looming safety concerns and the difficulty of marrying them with the rigors of religious and cultural guidelines in a country where modesty is often a prime concern			0
last year , the mayor of the restive southern city of @entity67 -- considered the @entity19 birthplace -- was killed during a city hall meeting when explosives detonated inside the turban of his attacker			0
on saturday , @entity7 's @entity74 cautioned @entity1 against the suggestion of @entity7 culpability in thursday 's attack while raising questions about security lapses			1
" before leveling charges the @entity2 government would do well if they shared information or evidence with the government of @entity7 that they might have with regard to the cowardly attack on the head of @entity90 , " the ministry said in a statement			2
" they would also do well by ordering an investigation into any lapses in the security arrangements around the @entity90 chief			0
" the @entity74 added that " @entity7 is ready to assist any investigation of this criminal act			1
" but the attack has since raised questions about top @entity2 officials ' vulnerability to assassination attempts and the effect they could have on broader peace negotiations			0
known as a staunch @entity1 loyalist and practiced anti-taliban fighter , @entity105 was tapped as @entity2 's intelligence chief in september			1
he drew attention in @entity16 and across the region for his experience and at times heavy - handed tactics , particularly in the country 's volatile south , serving as @entity67 's governor in 2005 and later as minister of tribal and border affairs where he oversaw southern security forces			2
considered an ambitious man despite dropping out of @entity120 , @entity105 joined famed @entity122 leader @entity121 , known as the " @entity121 , " before the @entity124 - led invasion in 2001			0
largely viewed as a well - connected senior official critical to the president 's inner circle , thursday 's attack against @entity105 drew comparisons to last year 's assassination of @entity131 , an @entity2 leader spearheading the reconciliation process with the @entity19			1
@entity131 , a former @entity2 president and chairman of the @entity134 , was killed in a suicide attack at his home on september 20 , 2011			0
" the attack against ( @entity131 ) was formulated in @entity8 , and now the attack on @entity105 has also been organized in @entity7 , " @entity1 said saturday			1
@entity8 is the provincial capital of @entity139 , a volatile @entity7 province that borders @entity2 , where a @entity19 leadership council known as the @entity141 is believed to have been based since the @entity124 - led invasion in 2001			1
it was formed after coalition forces toppled the @entity19 - led government , prompting senior @entity19 leaders to escape to @entity7 , which has been at times blamed for harboring the group			2
though @entity124 officials say it is not clear if the group still remains in @entity8			0
@entity0 's @entity151 in @entity16 and @entity152 in @entity153 contributed to this report			0
@entity155 is in @entity156 .			0

the attack occurred in one of the intelligence agency guesthouses in @entity16
