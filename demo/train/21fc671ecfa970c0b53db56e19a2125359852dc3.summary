-- @entity2 and @entity3 lock horns saturday in the first of four ' @entity6 ' showdowns in 18 days which will define their respective campaigns in @entity9 and the @entity10			1
@entity2 go into the @entity12 match at the @entity13 with an eight - point lead in the standings and with only seven games remaining			1
but the motivation for @entity18 's @entity3 will be to disrupt their arch - rival 's serene progress to the @entity9 title ahead of further matches in the final of the @entity25 and then the two - legged @entity10 semifinal			1
victory for @entity2 will complete a league double over @entity3 , who they routed 5 - 0 earlier in the season in the @entity31 , and all but wrap up the title			1
it was the heaviest defeat of @entity18 's stellar managerial career and clearly still smarts as he refused to answer questions at his pre-match press conference friday and offered up his assistant @entity37 to the anger of journalists			1
" every time he talks , it 's blown out of context , " @entity37 told the reporters , who exited in droves when it became clear @entity18 had snubbed them and would not answer their questions			1
" he prefers being relaxed and calm and it is n't the first time that i 've given the press conference			0
it 's just our way of working , " added @entity37			0
but @entity3 's record signing @entity55 , who has scored 28 league goals this season , believes they can reverse the result in their home stadium			1
" it is completely different to the first game ( when @entity3 lost 5 - 0 ) , " @entity55 told @entity61			2
" we have to think it is possible ( to win ) because they ( @entity2 ) are not from another planet			1
" they are one of the best footballing sides but we are in good shape and have to be confident that the best team will win			0
" @entity2 have won the last five @entity71 , scoring 16 goals against just two , but coach @entity73 is taking nothing for granted			2
" we wo n't make the mistake of going to the @entity77 thinking nothing is lost if we lose , " he said @entity73			0
" we have the opportunity to take a decisive step towards the league title			0
" @entity73 has defensive problems with captain @entity82 injured and @entity83 recuperating from surgery on a liver tumor			0
he must decide whether to use midfielder @entity86 or draft in @entity87 in central defense			0
but all eyes will be on the free - scoring @entity2 attack , led by @entity91 , who has scored a club record 48 goals this season			2
@entity91 , who was in superb form in the earlier league victory , will be looking to score for the first time against a team managed by @entity18			2
in other @entity12 action at the weekend , @entity100 travel to bottom side @entity101 on saturday looking to cement third place after their 5 - 0 rout of local rivals @entity107 last sunday .			0
