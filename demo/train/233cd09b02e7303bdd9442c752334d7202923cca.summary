@entity0 -- the @entity4 governor 's race has often been looked to as an off - year barometer of national political sentiment			0
this year 's grind - it - out race , an acrimonious spitball contest between two candidates only slightly more likeable than @entity11 , is anything but			0
in a lesser - of - two - evils campaign , @entity13 , the longtime @entity15 fundraiser and confidante to former president @entity17 , is clinging to a modest but sturdy lead over @entity21 @entity20 , the state 's attorney general			1
@entity21 have pilloried @entity13 as a sleazy political operator and failed businessman who exploited his @entity0 connections to help his sputtering car company , @entity26			1
@entity20 has been targeted as a far - right social crusader who would curb abortion rights and access to contraception			2
democrats on @entity30 are fond of calling him # creepyken			0
@entity13 is leading @entity20 among likely voters by an eight - point margin , 47 % to 39 % , according to a @entity35 poll out this week			1
@entity13 is hardly bulletproof : a federal investigation into @entity26 has sullied his reputation , and only two - thirds of @entity15 -- his own party -- consider him " honest and trustworthy			1
" but @entity20 is on much shakier ground			2
while @entity21 are slightly more fired up about voting for him than @entity15 are for @entity13 , @entity20 's favorable ratings are next - to - toxic : more than half of likely voters view him unfavorably			1
as public dismay with the two main candidates calcifies , the baby - faced 37 - year old @entity47 candidate from @entity49 has quietly crept northward in the polls , reaching 10 % in the @entity35 poll			1
that 's not nearly enough to win in november -- with just five weeks until @entity55 , even @entity45 admits " we have to get a lot higher " -- but he looks increasingly likely to play the role of spoiler by siphoning conservative votes away from @entity20			1
@entity45 chafes at the label			2
" i do n't even know what it means to be a spoiler , " he said in an interview			0
" the system is rotten to the core from @entity21 and @entity15 malfeasance			1
they have already spoiled the system			0
i do n't even know what it means to be a spoiler			0
if i am the only one arguing for freedom and the rule of law , then those two are the spoilers as far as i 'm concerned			0
" positioning himself as a moderate the @entity81 and @entity82 - educated attorney and software programmer -- he was part of a team that won @entity86 's @entity85 for creating a " mobile app for true nightlifers " -- is positioning himself as the moderate choice between two " extreme " candidates			0
in his telling , @entity13 " stands for an extreme version of crony capitalism			2
" @entity20 is " very regressive on social issues " and " unreliable " on economic matters			2
both parties , he said , are in league with the banks and " rich folks " -- a frustration that first motivated him to run for office in 2011 , when he mounted an unsuccessful @entity21 bid to unseat longtime @entity15 state @entity106 leader @entity105			1
though he said he left the @entity21 after that race , he voted in @entity4 's @entity21 presidential primary in 2012 , casting a ballot for @entity111			2
that november , he voted for @entity112 , the @entity47 nominee			2
@entity45 supports same - sex marriage , marijuana legalization and says climate change is real			2
he opposes gun restrictions , higher taxes , the expansion of @entity119 under the @entity120 , and last year 's landmark transportation bill in @entity122 that raised some taxes to help fix northern @entity4 's clogged roadways			0
@entity45 said he would pay for transportation funding , in part , by cutting from the education budget and finding ways to " prioritize spending			0
" @entity45 might deny being a spoiler , but @entity20 's campaign conceded thursday that the @entity47 is draining support from the @entity21 nominee			1
" there 's no question that a vote for @entity45 is a vote for @entity13 and a vote against liberty , " said @entity134 , @entity20 's communications director			1
" it 's important to remember that there 's no greater defender of first principles and liberty in @entity4 than @entity20 , " @entity134 said , outlining why @entity47 - leaning @entity21 should stay in the party fold			1
" @entity20 was the first attorney general in the nation to sue to stop @entity120 and he led an eight year battle to secure @entity150 ' private property rights in the state constitution			2
he 's also the only candidate in this race who 's laid out a clear , substantive plan to free up the private sector and create 58,000 jobs			0
" challenges for third - party candidates few political observers in @entity4 expect @entity45 , who has little money in the bank and almost no political machinery behind him , to reach the 10 % threshold , or even the 8 % mark he hit in another recent poll from @entity168 and @entity169			0
the last third - party candidate in @entity4 to reach that level of support was @entity173 , who snagged 11 % of the vote in the madcap three - way 1994 @entity106 race			0
unlike @entity45 , though , @entity173 had political pedigree and bona fide institutional support : then - sen. @entity178 backed @entity173 that year over the flame - throwing @entity21 nominee , @entity179			1
the @entity15 incumbent , @entity180 , eked out a three - point win that year			0
a more recent example of third - party noise - making came in the 2005 governor 's race , when @entity187 , a @entity21 state senator who ran as an independent , aired a memorable statewide television ad featuring people loudly banging on pots as they chanted " we want @entity187 ! " despite polling as high as 9 % that year , @entity187 only garnered 2 % in the end , as democrat @entity194 edged out @entity21 @entity195 to win the governorship			1
even if @entity45 tumbles from his current standing and only captures a small slice of the vote on @entity55 , republicans fear that most of that support will come straight out of @entity20 's back pocket , especially in what 's expected to be a low turnout election			1
" nearly all of his vote will come from people right of center who feel obligated to vote but ca n't support @entity20 because he is too far to the right , or they fear what he would be like as governor and ca n't vote for @entity13 because he 's a @entity194 , " observed one well - connected @entity122 @entity21 who is not directly involved in the race			1
@entity20 faces gender gap @entity20 is in trouble with or without a third party candidate , due in large part to a startling gender gap that emerged this summer after free - spending @entity15 began hammering the @entity21 on women 's health issues			1
women favor @entity13 over @entity20 by an enormous 24 - point margin , and even without @entity45 in the race , the @entity35 poll showed @entity13 leading @entity20 by a five - point margin , 49 - 44			1
but @entity45 is n't going anywhere , and his rising poll numbers are making an uphill fight for @entity20 that much steeper			2
@entity45 ' most obvious challenge is exposure			0
a large majority of @entity4 voters still have no clue who he is or what he stands for , a challenge that was n't made easier by his exclusion from a debate wednesday night sponsored by the @entity239			0
in response , @entity45 tapped into his meager campaign budget -- he reported having only $ 19,109 in the bank at the end of august -- to run a tv ad during the debate attacking @entity13 's " cronyism " and @entity20 's " narrow - minded social agenda			1
" the ad starred his two children and his @entity252 - @entity251 wife , @entity250 , whom he met in a @entity254 book store when he spied her reading " the @entity255 " and told her he had recently seen the movie			0
@entity257 , a @entity45 adviser , said the campaign has been in touch with the organizers of the third and final debate in @entity262 in late october , and have received " encouraging " signals about being included			0
until then , @entity45 said he 's content to meet voters by driving around the commonwealth in his van , listening to @entity267 , as the other campaigns savage each other on the airwaves			0
" if they keep destroying each other with negative ads that 's fine with us , " he said drily .			0

@entity21 look to retain governorship in *battleground* state
race between @entity13 and @entity20 is viewed by some as " lesser of two evils "
enter @entity45 , a @entity47 candidate who has quietly crept up in the polls
he says " the system is rotten " due to @entity21 and @entity15 " malfeasance "
