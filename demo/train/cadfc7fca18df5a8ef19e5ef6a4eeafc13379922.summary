@entity0 -- a @entity0 district attorney recommended monday that charges be dropped against former @entity5 chief @entity4 , who was accused more than three months ago of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper			1
in " a recommendation for dismissal " filed in court monday , two prosecutors in the @entity10 district attorney 's office laid out their arguments for requesting that numerous charges -- including attempted rape and sexual assault -- be dismissed , citing fresh evidence and questions about the accuser 's credibility			1
" the nature and number of the complainant 's falsehoods leave us unable to credit her version of events beyond a reasonable doubt , whatever the truth may be about the encounter between the complainant and the defendant , " the document states			1
" if we do not believe her beyond a reasonable doubt , we can not ask a jury to do so			1
" the prosecutors voiced concern that the case appeared to rest exclusively on the housekeeper @entity40 , predicting her " falsehoods " would be " devastating " if revealed during a trial			0
they claim she " has not been truthful in matters great and small , " including lying about a " gang rape , as well as other details about her life in ( her native ) @entity48			0
" in the document , the district attorney 's office notes that dna testing indicated semen on her dress matched @entity4 and shows there was a sexual encounter			1
there was " no trauma to her body or oral cavity " and " scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results			0
" moreover , prosecutors claim @entity40 's current story of her " prompt outcry to her first supervisor is inconsistent with certain aspects of that supervisor 's account			0
" " all of the evidence that might be relevant to the contested issues of force and lack of consent is simply inconclusive , " wrote the prosecutors			1
the decision to drop charges -- which still needs to be approved by a judge -- was cheered by @entity4 's attorney and jeered by the alleged victim 's lawyer , as well as some women 's rights advocates			1
a status hearing for the case is scheduled for tuesday			0
@entity90 , who represents @entity40 , addressed reporters after meeting with prosecutors monday afternoon for less than half an hour			0
hours earlier , he filed his own motion asking a judge to halt proceedings in the case and appoint a special prosecutor			0
" manhattan district attorney @entity98 has denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case , " @entity90 said			1
" he has not only turned his back on this innocent victim , but he has also turned his back on the forensic , medical and other evidence in this case			1
" if the @entity10 district attorney , who is elected to protect our mothers , our daughters , our sisters , our wives and our loved ones , is not going to stand up for them when they 're raped or sexually assaulted , who will ? " but @entity4 's @entity118 - based attorneys , @entity119 and @entity120 , lauded the decision to drop charges , saying it vindicates their consistent claims that their client is innocent and his accuser " was not credible			1
" " mr. @entity4 and his family are grateful that the @entity98 's office took our concerns seriously and concluded on its own that this case can not proceed further , " the attorneys said in a statement			1
aside from the court filing , there was no immediate comment from the office of district attorney @entity98 on the attorneys ' statements , and his office earlier declined to comment on the motion			1
@entity90 had said before the meeting monday that he believed @entity98 was going to drop the charges			2
a grand jury indicted the then - @entity5 chief in may over allegations he sexually assaulted housekeeper @entity40 in his @entity0 hotel suite			0
he pleaded not guilty and , after several days behind bars , was ordered held on house arrest			0
but on july 1 , a judge freed him after prosecutors learned @entity40 had lied about the specifics of her whereabouts after the incident and past details of an asylum application and information on tax forms			0
prosecutors said she admitted lying on the asylum application about having been a victim of a gang rape , even providing details of an attack and later admitting it never happened			0
@entity4 's attorneys have insisted that any sexual encounter was consensual			1
@entity40 , who has conducted high - profile interviews about the case , and her attorneys have said @entity4 attacked her , and that her case should go to trial			2
attorneys for @entity40 complain she is being treated by prosecutors like a criminal defendant and not an alleged victim			1
and in a rally after the district attorney 's court filing monday , some of her supporters urged prosecutors to still pursue the case and warned about the message sent by dropping charges			2
" are we telling ( sexual assault victims ) that if they dare to name a powerful , politically connected man as their abuser , they will see their whole life laid out to be judged publicly ? " asked @entity0 councilwoman @entity185			0
" what does it take for a low - income immigrant -- a woman of color -- to publicly name one of the most powerful men in @entity199 as a sexual abuser ? " @entity40 has filed a civil lawsuit against @entity4 , without specifying the financial damages she was seeking			2
entering monday 's meeting , @entity90 said he suspected -- based on the contents of a letter he received friday -- that @entity98 intended to drop charges			2
that prompted the alleged victim 's motion filed monday , which cites allegations of " abuse of confidence , unfair treatment and bias and prejudices " by @entity98 that , @entity40 's attorneys claim , should disqualify him from the case			1
this motion is @entity90 's second effort to remove @entity98 from the case			2
in july , he asked @entity98 to step down and appoint a special prosecutor			2
" this is not a ' he said , she said ' case , " @entity90 said sunday			0
" if you go back to the hearing on may 16 , when ( an assistant district attorney ) called the evidence against @entity4 ' substantial ' and he said the medical exam ( of @entity40 ) supports her account , this is not a ' he said , she said ' case			1
" there is overwhelming evidence to support that a sex assault occurred , " @entity90 said			0
after @entity40 took her case public , @entity4 's attorneys , @entity236 and @entity120 , put out a statement saying , " ms. @entity40 is the first accuser in history to conduct a media campaign to persuade a prosecutor to pursue charges ... against a person from whom she wants money			1
" attorney @entity247 , who is working on @entity40 's behalf in @entity249 , said monday that he was to meet with several people prior to a news conference scheduled for tuesday			0
@entity247 would not reveal with whom he is talking monday and tuesday , however a source familiar with the meetings said one of them is a @entity257 journalist , @entity255 , who filed a formal complaint against @entity4 in @entity257 for an alleged attack in 2002			2
the accused has filed a counter-suit for slander			0
@entity255 's mother also claims she was attacked by @entity4			2
@entity1 senior legal analyst @entity263 says that @entity4 should now be able to breathe easier and " return to some semblance of his former life			0
" but he said that no one involved in the case " comes out of it looking very good			0
" " this is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim , the defendant , and the prosecutor , " @entity263 said			1
" the conclusion is likely to be entirely satisfying to no one			0

new : the @entity98 says evidence related to " force and lack of consent " is " inconclusive "
the da 's office says it does *n't* believe the accuser " beyond a reasonable doubt "
@entity4 is " grateful " the @entity98 " took our concerns seriously , " his lawyers say
the alleged victim 's attorney says the @entity98 " turned his back " on his client
