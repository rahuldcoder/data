-- by hosting " @entity2 " this weekend , @entity1 might have just had the last laugh			1
the 20 - year - old pop star has eclipsed nearly every other figure in popular culture in the weeks following her salacious twerking - with - teddy - bears routine with @entity8 at the 2013 @entity9 on august 25			1
there was no way " @entity2 " was not going to address the subsequent tidal wave of reaction , and the sketch comedy series smartly attacked it right at the start of the cold open			2
with " snl " cast member @entity18 playing a wise old - timer in the year 2045 , he recounts what led @entity21 to an apocalyptic state of destruction			1
" most folks say it was the government shutdown			0
but i remember the exact day @entity21 ended : it was the 2013 @entity9 , " @entity18 said			0
photos : @entity1 wild child @entity1 was in on the joke from the start , as the camera cut to her being warned not to take the stage by " old @entity1 , " as played by " snl 's " @entity1 impressionist , @entity33			1
( " i think i 'm hallucinating , " @entity1 said in a winking joke			2
" i must 've smoked too much ... cigarettes			0
" ) " @entity40 " was there to warn that the @entity37 routine " might be too controversial " and hit all the references in the process : @entity1 ' revealing costume that could potentially land her in prison ; the constant tongue wagging ( " i 'm having tiny strokes , yo ! " @entity1 explained ) ; and the stuffed animals as stage props			1
( cried one stuffed bear before going on stage , " we should n't be doing this ! this is for kids ! " ) but in the end , @entity1 told her old self that while she knows kids look up to her as a role model , she 's still growing up herself			1
" i 'm only 20 years old , i need some freedom to grow up and make mistakes , " she said			0
" and no matter what happens , i promise i 'll always be true to @entity1			2
" just do n't expect her to feel the same way about her former @entity65 character , " @entity66			0
" as the 20 - year - old said in her opening monologue , " i do n't apologize for my @entity37 performance			1
if i owe anybody an apology , it 's the people who make the bottom half of shirts			0
there are a few subjects i 'm not going to get into tonight : i 'm not going to do @entity66 , but i can give you an update			0
" and thus began an extremely @entity1 - heavy episode of " @entity2 , " as she appeared in most of the night 's sketches and gave two pared - down performances of her hits , " @entity84 " and " @entity85			1
" while she 's made headlines for both the music videos for those songs and her attire while performing them live , on " snl " @entity1 turned in two tasteful sets that were focused less on her dance moves and more on her voice			1
she also provided impersonations of a few famous faces , including @entity95 and @entity96 , but the favorite of the night was her take on @entity98 in a parody of her " @entity84 " music video , " we did @entity101 ( the government )			0
" with @entity103 playing speaker @entity104 in a tight white tank and matching leggings , the parody was easily one of the night 's best sketches			2
sample lyrics : " to my government workers on the furlough , even though you 're already paid low : remember only @entity113 can judge us , forget the haters , because somebody elected us			0
" one topic conspicuously missing from the broadcast was any mention of @entity120 , the singer @entity1 has been publicly battling with over social media			2
it all began when @entity120 wrote an open letter to @entity1 last week about her nudity and suggestiveness in the " @entity85 " music video			2
@entity1 hit back with a tweeted dig at @entity120 's past mental health issues , as well as the infamous moment in 1992 when the " @entity131 " singer ripped up a photo of @entity133 on " snl			1
" yet for all those who waited patiently to see how " @entity2 " and @entity1 would tackle the back - and - forth -- which on friday grew to threats of legal action -- they were left disappointed			1
@entity120 was n't mentioned , nor was a photo dramatically torn in her honor			0
overall , the episode was smooth , light on nudity and mainly twerk - free			0
" hey , look at that , " tweeted the @entity145 's @entity144			0
" @entity1 did n't just play an exaggerated version of herself and she was really good			1
" for the @entity149 , @entity1 ' episode outshone last week 's " snl " premiere with veteran @entity151			1
even @entity152 weighed in with support			0
so why did n't @entity1 incorporate the one dance move that 's been at the center of the insane amount of debate she 's caused ? well , " i used to think twerking was cool , " @entity1 explained during her monologue			2
" but now that white people are doing it it seems kinda lame			0

@entity1 hosted and performed as a musical guest on " snl "
the 20 - year - old poked fun at the reaction to her @entity37 performance
but , she said , she was n't going to apologize
she appeared in several sketches throughout the night , and sang twice
