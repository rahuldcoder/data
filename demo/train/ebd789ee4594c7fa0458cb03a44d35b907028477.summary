-- " @entity3 " had buzz right from the moment it premiered in 1986			1
co-created by @entity6 , hot off his success with " @entity8 , " the series was set at the high - priced @entity10 law firm of @entity11 , @entity3 , @entity12 and @entity13			1
the cast was glossy and diverse , including @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			1
most of all , it pushed the boundaries of the legal show the way " @entity28 " did with cop shows			1
" @entity3 's " principals argued cases involving rape , capital punishment , big business , child molestation , @entity35 and medical malpractice at a time when such subjects were seldom mentioned on prime - time television , and certainly not in such detail			1
this was no " @entity42 , " or even " @entity43			0
" @entity6 being @entity6 , the hard stuff was paired with moments of silly humor and steamy sex ( or silly sex and steamy humor ) , making for a high - wire balance of drama and comedy			0
one first - season episode got people talking about a fictional sex act called the " @entity56 " ; later , the show actually killed off a character by dropping her down an elevator shaft			1
the big hair and big - shouldered suits of the ' 80s may be gone , but the show remains influential			2
@entity63 , a real - life lawyer who later created " @entity65 , " " @entity66 " and " @entity67 , " got his television start as a writer on " @entity3			1
" the show 's first season is finally out on @entity72 , with the second expected to follow in a few months			1
@entity4 spoke to @entity15 , now a star of " @entity75 " who played idealistic @entity76 attorney @entity3 , and @entity21 , who played bottom - line - oriented partner @entity3 and later starred on " @entity78 , " about the show and its impact			1
the following is a condensed version of the interviews , which were done separately : @entity4 : how did you get the part ? @entity15 : i was actually working in @entity87 at the time doing a " @entity88 : for hire , " and a manager sent me the ( description ) and said it was the guys from " @entity8 , " and would i like to go and meet on this ? i went to @entity95 to meet some executives , and they threw a bunch of legalese at ( me to perform )			1
i 'm a slow , kind of methodical study , so i did n't really do very well			2
one of my friends in @entity101 said , " you did n't meet this @entity6 guy			2
you met some lady who was weeding people out ! get on a @entity108 flight and stay with me and try to get in and set up another appointment			0
" i borrowed money , came out here -- and eventually got an audition with @entity6 and ( director ) @entity113			0
i met with @entity6 and he has all this sports memorabilia and he was swinging a baseball bat , and i said , if it does n't go well , do i get one of those over my head ? but it went well			2
@entity21 : i 'm married to @entity6 's sister ( @entity122 , who later played @entity3 's wife , @entity123 , on " @entity3 " ) , which is how we were able to invite him to the @entity10 film festival to see @entity128 's film " always			1
" it was right at the time when ( @entity6 ) was developing " @entity3			2
" what i did in that particular @entity133 film was the spark that brought @entity3 to me			2
@entity4 : i understand the portrait of @entity3 's father was of your actual dad ? @entity139 : that was my dad			1
considering they made a point in the pilot that @entity3 was the son of one of the co-founders and that @entity3 did n't quite measure up to the great man his father was , my father 's picture had a certain amount of charisma to it and i thought it was really apt. my relatives were thrilled and delighted that he was there			1
when there was an episode where my father 's picture did not get on screen , i 'd get a call from one of my relatives saying , " @entity21 ! no picture ! what happened ? " @entity4 : when did you know you were a hit ? @entity15 : at the end of the second or third season , i was on a plane going back to @entity95 a lot , and there was a person i was sitting next to who worked in admissions in colleges			1
and they were going to some convention and they were talking about how the number of law school applications had skyrocketed since the show had aired			1
that 's when i knew we were making an impact			2
@entity139 : lawyers liked the show			2
they often wrote the writers to ask for a particular summation on a case they were working for that they saw on the show , so they could incorporate it into their own summation			0
and every once in awhile , a guy would come up to me and say , " i 'm the @entity3 " -- he 's the business guy in his law firm			1
@entity4 : tell us about the camaraderie			0
@entity15 : the conference room scenes took a long time to shoot because it was a circular table and you had to shoot it a particular way			2
but it was such a great time we had during those conference room scenes because we were all together and we were always talking about the work			0
it felt like we were part of a theater ensemble			0
@entity139 : one of the things that made it such a happy set was how everyone 's character was served through the years , so that no one ran away from the show			1
it was an ensemble that had everyone making terrific contributions			0
@entity4 : what were some of your favorite moments ? @entity15 : i remember @entity226 working on a case , and he 's kind of an idol of mine , and it was @entity19 ( @entity231 ) 's case with him , but i do remember coming in one or two days just to see how he 'd handle closing arguments			1
@entity139 : my character had some interesting adventures with women , including my wife , so when i had some battles with my wife ( on the show ) , that was fun			0
and the affairs i had -- one with my father 's former mistress , and another with a sex therapist , were particularly adventurous and fun			0
@entity4 : what are you up to now ? @entity139 : i 'm looking for that third tv series			0
i loved my first two -- i got to work with @entity6 , one of the best ever , and @entity249 , one of the best ever			0
i have an independent film and guest spots here and there			0
fingers crossed , i 'm looking for that third series			0
@entity15 : i think the ( " @entity75 " ) writers room gets together in late march , beginning of april			2
we start ( shooting ) in may			0
( so ) i 'm trying to look for jobs , man			0
you 're always doing " @entity262			0
" it 's always @entity264 , knocking on doors .			0
