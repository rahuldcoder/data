-- @entity1 -- the 3 - year - old @entity3 girl whose family claimed was asked to leave @entity5 because of her appearance -- will be fitted for a prosthetic eye			1
@entity1 , who lost sight in her right eye and was left with severe facial scars after a pit bull attack , will meet with @entity12 , an ocularist who hopes to outfit her with a prosthetic eye this week at his office in @entity17 , @entity18			1
an ocularist is a trained technician who makes prosthetic eyes			1
@entity12 said he does n't care about the controversy surrounding what her family said happened to her at @entity5			1
he just wants to help a child in need			2
" that 's another world as far as i am concerned			2
that 's not going to affect me with how i help the child , " he said of the @entity5 incident			1
" i am focused on this child , and if that did happen , it 's sad because it is a double tragedy for the child			2
" @entity1 's grandmother , @entity37 , took to @entity38 last month to tell a story about how @entity1 , who wears an eye patch and eats through a tube , was told to leave a @entity5 in @entity3 because her appearance was disturbing to other patrons			1
online fundraising campaigns brought in thousands , including $ 30,000 and an apology from @entity5			1
but veracity of the story has since been called into question			0
a pair of investigations found no proof she was ever asked to leave @entity5 and a local newspaper also cast doubt on the family 's story			1
both @entity12 , who has donated his services and assisted with travel accommodations , and @entity60 spoke to @entity0 sunday about @entity62 's road to recovery			0
" she do n't have an eye socket and no cheekbone , " said @entity60			2
" we had to put her back in diapers because of the wounds on her legs			0
she ca n't pull things up and down on them			0
the wounds will bleed , and she screams bloody murder			0
" not knowing the full extent of the damage , @entity12 said he is not even sure if an artificial eye is a feasible option			2
but that is not going to stop him from trying			0
" i will help her as long as i am able , " he said			0
" we do n't want this child to walk in the shadows			0
" despite saying it had n't found proof that one of its restaurants mistreated the girl or her grandmother , @entity5 said it will still honor its commitment to donate $ 30,000 to assist with @entity62 's medical bills			1
" we hope everyone keeps @entity62 in their thoughts and prayers , " the chain said in a statement last month			0
" she will certainly be in ours			0
