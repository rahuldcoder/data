-- there are many well - known risk factors for death -- high cholesterol , smoking , obesity , and @entity7			1
several studies show you have a greater chance of dying on @entity7 , the day after @entity7 or @entity11 than any other single day of the year			1
this is true for people who die of natural causes , which account for 93 % of all deaths , according to the @entity16			1
it 's also true , researchers say , for people who die of the five most common diseases : circulatory problems , respiratory diseases , endocrine / nutritional / metabolic problems , digestive diseases and cancer			1
there 's a spike in deaths for all age groups on those days with one exception -- children			1
@entity32 who was the lead author on a couple of these studies , noticed this trend when studying @entity37 death certificates			1
specifically , @entity32 , a professor in the sociology department at @entity39 , and his team looked at the number of people who died in emergency settings and those who were considered dead on arrival between 1979 and 2004			2
they found a spike in deaths on those three days			1
an earlier @entity32 study from 2004 found a similar trend , specifically in cardiac deaths			2
a more recent 2013 study in @entity52 found patients admitted to hospitals as emergencies on public holidays are significantly more likely to die than those admitted on other days of the week -- including weekends			2
scientists still ca n't explain this phenomenon , although there are plenty of popular theories			1
@entity64 is the obituary writer at the @entity65 and president of the @entity68 writers			0
over the years he has noticed his workload pick up over the holidays			1
" we are always getting a slew of obits this time of year , " @entity64 said			0
" i noticed this happened pretty regularly so i did call around to funeral directors to see if they believed there was an uptick too			2
" he wondered if stress or sadness had something to do with it			0
" i 've written many stories about a spouse or a partner dying and then you see the remaining partner die within hour or days or weeks or months			0
to me there seems to be a correlation between body and mind here			0
" @entity32 and his team looked at the number of deaths among the @entity94 's population , theorizing they may be less aware of the holidays and the stress it can trigger			1
if stress were solely to blame , he figured , their deaths would n't spike on @entity7 or @entity102 's			1
but sure enough , he found cardiac deaths were slightly higher at the holidays when @entity94 's was listed as a secondary cause of death			1
more people do die in winter months than in any other season , so @entity32 looked to see if there were more deaths in the states that experience colder temperatures			2
that was n't the case , either			0
the cardiac mortality peak is slightly smaller in the states that border @entity116 , compared to states that border the @entity118 , he found			0
what about festive eating or drinking ? @entity123 ' team found deaths were still up for people who were in inpatient treatment -- whose diet and alcohol consumption was strictly regulated			1
in fact , those who died with substance abuse listed as a secondary cause of death saw a smaller holiday peak than those who died from cardiac diseases alone			2
despite popular belief , the suicide rate does n't spike at the holidays			1
in fact , the suicide rate in december is at its lowest -- it peaks in spring and fall			1
the homicide rate also goes down for the holidays			2
@entity32 thinks the true reason that @entity7 and @entity102 's are a risk factor for death may actually have much more to do with access to care			1
people who are n't feeling well may be putting off a trip to the hospital so they can stay with their family to celebrate @entity7 or @entity102 's , he said			1
holiday staffing at the hospital may also be to blame , he said , citing statistics from @entity152 trauma centers			1
" for those deaths , the spike was even sharper , " @entity32 said			2
" those are the cases where seconds make a difference and you may see a real difference between the response of a junior and senior member of staff			0
" he said he hopes his research could help hospitals and patients plan accordingly			0
if the worst does happen , resources are available			0
for instance , @entity168 , family services coordinator at the nonprofit @entity169 in @entity170 , @entity171 , said she and her staff are prepared to help families find a healthy way to deal with grief over the loss of a loved one			0
" we want to make sure we are ready for any phone calls to make sure people are all right in their grief , " @entity168 said			0
" the holidays definitely are a harder time of year for people when this happens , especially since they are such a time steeped in tradition and family			2
" if you know someone who loses a loved one over the holiday , @entity168 said be sure to be extra sensitive to their emotions			0
" everything can feel upside down for people			0
there are emotional landmines everywhere , so do n't try to force anything , " @entity168 said			0
" you do n't need to fill the air with words			0
tell them you are ready to listen			0
that can be more powerful than you know			0

@entity16 : natural deaths spike on @entity7 , the day after and @entity102 's
people who work with death have noticed the phenomenon for years
people who delay treatment and holiday hospital staffing may be to blame
despite popular belief , the suicide rate does n't spike at the holidays
