@entity0 , @entity1 -- at dusk , stand on the @entity4 over @entity5 , the span linking hip downtown to funkier @entity8 , and you 'll see it			1
@entity8 offers an array of choices for fitness and nightlife			1
no , not the 1.5 million @entity16 free - tailed bats that emerge from crevasses below and fwip - fwip - fwip into the night ( although they 're pretty cool -- see them on the way to doing something else and it will be time well spent )			1
what you 'll see is @entity8 's diversity			1
and i do n't mean yuppies , hippies , hipsters , scenesters , tech geeks , cowboys , students , musicians , politicians or got - more - money - than - sense rich folks , either -- though @entity8 has ' em all and more			1
cooling off after a run , perhaps			2
they come together here to witness the bats ' spectacle			0
live music capital of the world ? well , @entity8 at least has the clubs , dance halls , bar districts and late - night restaurants to keep a night person hopping			1
but @entity8 also caters to the early - to - bed , early - to - rise , run - six - miles - before - breakfast person			1
and , if you think you can , you can run all day and dance all night			1
daylight 's burning a swath of wilderness : with no mountains , you would n't think @entity0 would be a destination for mountain bikers			0
well , it 's not @entity68 , @entity69 , but it 's not bad			0
the highlight : the @entity71			0
this strip of green meanders from @entity74 in the heart of @entity8 westward for 7.5 miles ( with many side trails ) , ending at the @entity77 -- a quarter - mile climb to test your thighs and lungs			1
the @entity71 is popular with hikers and wanderers , so it 's best not to crank with abandon , but the wooded straightaways and wet ( sometimes ) creek crossings make for an enjoyable ride			0
ca n't bring your bike ? rent one at @entity89 , 517 s. @entity90 ten miles downtown : the @entity91 and @entity92 runs 10.4 miles , mostly along the shores of the @entity94 on the southern border of downtown			2
there are walkers and easy - going cyclists , but this is also an excellent trail for running and getting a good look at @entity8 ( as well as at other runners )			1
the western half of the trail is alive with people ( and an occasional celebrity ) , surrounded by trees			0
the eastern half involves crossing over @entity109 , navigating some neighborhoods and a small stretch along city streets , but offers more solitude and wide - open trail			2
the soul of @entity8 : @entity116 ( 2101 @entity117 ) is three acres of old - school , spring - fed swimming			1
open year - round , it 's a jump - in - and - gasp 68 degrees no matter the weather			2
nestled in a corner of @entity74 , surrounded by pecan trees , the pool is often crowded ( but seldom overwhelmed ) on summer weekends and draws one of the most diverse crowds in @entity8			1
refueling stations enchiladas and margaritas : @entity133 's @entity132 ( 2613 s. @entity90 ) is big , busy and well worth the wait			1
since 1952 this hot spot has been @entity8 's self - proclaimed " @entity136			1
" if they 're not right about that , they 're at least in the royal family			0
you ca n't get away without trying the @entity143 dip -- think " super-queso			0
" dueling barbecue joints : whatever you 're looking for in @entity1 barbecue , you only have to choose between @entity149 's @entity148 ( 801 @entity150 st. ) and @entity151 ( 2000 e. 12th street )			1
@entity149 's was once owned by the late patron saint of barbecue , @entity154			2
@entity155 's was a favorite of the late blues legend @entity158			0
@entity149 's is a restaurant and live music venue			0
@entity155 's is a joint with uneven floors and character			0
@entity149 's anchors its own entertainment mini-district			0
@entity155 's is definitely outside the tourist zone			0
either way , you get a true barbecue experience			2
nighttime is the right time bars , bars , bars : a river of alcohol runs along @entity8 's @entity177			1
the current is strongest in the entertainment district between @entity109 and @entity4 : a cluster of crowded nightspots ranging from the rarified air of the elite @entity184 bar to the @entity186 ' monkey			2
heading west , the river thins out and the scene grows up : there 's mother @entity191 's @entity190 ( 715 @entity192 ) , where the @entity193 once ruled the tuesday night trivia contest			2
and at the intersection with @entity197 , there 's @entity199 ' flagship store -- where you can drink and shop at the same time			0
@entity0 ? you ca n't go anywhere here without seeing some fellow earnestly strumming a guitar			0
for the best chance at hearing something good , you want to head to a venue known for live music			0
the @entity211 ( 1315 s. @entity212 ) is not just one of @entity8 's best , but also in the midst of the @entity216 district of fashionable stores , oddball shops and restaurants ( try the tacos al pastor at @entity222 's @entity221 -- 1412 s. @entity212 ) honky - tonk heaven : it 's a tech geek world , but the @entity225 ( 3201 s. @entity90 ) is a refuge for those whose appreciation of cowboy boots and heartbroke country songs is irony - free			1
the @entity225 is the real thing -- no urban cowboy stuff here			0
populated by singers such as @entity236 and @entity237 , serving up a mean chicken - fried steak and complete with its own museum of photos from better days , the @entity225 looks and feels ... just like it should			0

@entity8 , @entity1 , has clubs and bar districts to keep a night person hopping
it also has outdoor activities to please a run - six - miles - before - breakfast person
barbecue , enchiladas and margaritas help *visitors* refuel
