@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is a woman on the hunt			1
the women 's rights activist wears a determined expression on her face as she paces the dirt roads of this remote village , looking for the man who @entity1 authorities say beat his wife and put her in a hospital twice in less than 12 months			1
" have you seen @entity17 ? " she asks the village mayor 's daughter			2
" he disappeared with his car			2
" " no one 's seen him , " the woman replies			2
some other villagers retreat behind the mud - brick walls of their homes as @entity3 approaches			1
convicted wife beater the man @entity3 is looking for is @entity27 , one of the 600 residents of @entity29			2
last fall , a court sentenced him to 15 months in prison for assault , after his 30 - year old wife @entity33 was hospitalized with trauma wounds			1
video footage filmed in september of 2009 shows @entity37 outside of the hospital in the provincial capital of @entity40			2
her face was horribly bruised ; her head encased in bandages			2
part of @entity33 's right ear had been sliced off			2
the woman could barely walk and leaned on her brother for support , as she hobbled a few short steps into the hospital			2
after the incident , @entity1 authorities separated @entity54 and her children from her husband and placed them in a state - run women 's shelter			1
but barely two months later , a local criminal court asked that @entity33 and her children be handed back to @entity61			0
he had not served any jail time for beating his wife			0
" at that time , because he showed regret and because his [ criminal ] record was clean , his sentence was postponed , " said @entity65 , the governor of @entity67 district where @entity68 is located			0
" also , the wife withdrew her complaint			0
" @entity54 is an ethnic kurd who speaks no @entity1			1
according to eyewitnesses , when she appeared in court , she could not understand the judge or prosecutor , and relied on her husband to translate legal proceedings			0
on a snowy day last december , local women 's rights activists like @entity3 could do little more then watch helplessly , as @entity61 led his mutilated wife away from the courtyard , back to the village where they lived			1
widespread violence against women " this kind of thing happens in every village , " says @entity3 , one of the founders of a grassroots local family protection association in the @entity67 district of southeastern @entity1			1
" there are thousands of women like @entity33 out here			1
" in fact , according to a 2009 @entity1 government report , 42 percent of women surveyed said they had been the victims of either physical or sexual abuse by their husband or partner			1
the report concluded that one in four married @entity1 women had been injured by partner violence			1
meanwhile , one in ten @entity1 women were injured by such violence while pregnant			1
some @entity1 activists fear the real statistics for violence against women may actually be much higher			1
" in all domestic surveys there are ' shadow figures			0
' that is because women are not willing to tell about the violence , it 's a very sensitive issue , " says @entity114 , a co-founder of the @entity116 - based group @entity115			1
" we think it 's much higher than 42 percent			0
" domestic violence against women is not confined to economically - depressed , rural regions of eastern @entity1			1
according to the @entity1 government survey , the statistics for physical and sexual assault were roughly the same in the countryside as in the most developed , fast - growing cities in the western part of the country			1
over the past 15 years , @entity1 has adopted several progressive pieces of legislation to protect women , including a @entity136 against @entity137			1
reform of @entity1 's @entity139 in 2001 gave women legal equal status to men in the family			1
meanwhile , changes to the country 's @entity145 in 2004 criminalized marital rape			0
but critics argue that the @entity1 state has lapsed far behind in implementing these laws			1
" the law prohibits violence against women , including spousal abuse , but the government did not effectively enforce it , " the @entity151 said in its 2009 human rights report on @entity1			1
despite widespread violence against women , in 2009 the @entity1 government reported there were only 52 state - run shelters for women in the entire country			1
those shelters have the capacity to house less than 1,300 residents , in a country where the population exceeds 70 million			1
" there is a lack of coordinated action and strong will on the part of the government to stop violence against women , " says @entity114			1
' it looks as if she was tortured ' not long after @entity54 returned to the village of @entity29 , neighbors and relatives began contacting authorities , reporting that her husband was once again beating her			0
but @entity33 's parents and siblings said @entity27 repeatedly threatened them when they tried to intervene			0
@entity33 's brother claims on one such occasion , his brother - in - law beat him up			1
" that man started beating my daughter the day she put on her wedding dress and he has been violent with her ever since , " said @entity187 , @entity33 's mother			0
" i wish he killed her long ago to spare her all the suffering			0
" in early july , gendarme security forces were summoned to the crude house where the @entity27 family lived			0
@entity197 , a member of the @entity68 village council and a relative of @entity61 , says he personally asked @entity33 if she was being abused , and she said no. " she deserved what happened , " @entity200 said			0
" because we gave her the chance to leave him and she did n't			0
" on july 15 , @entity61 brought his wife to the hospital in @entity40			0
" when the doctors discovered that she was battered , the husband escaped , " the @entity208 announced in a written statement on july 19			0
doctors at @entity40 hospital said @entity33 had trauma marks on various locations on her head , infections from injuries , a fever and there was a third - degree burn in the shape of an iron on her back			2
" it looked as if she had been tortured , " one @entity40 hospital doctor told @entity2 , on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give an interview			0
though there was no evidence of brain damage , for more then two weeks after being hospitalized , @entity33 was in a near - catatonic state , unable to move or respond to questions			1
@entity235 , the deputy chief doctor at the hospital , said psychiatrists suspected she suffered from extreme post-traumatic stress disorder			0
he added that the hospital frequently received female patients who appeared to be victims of abuse			0
" usually if a woman comes in who has been beaten , she will say ' i fell down the stairs ' or ' i bumped into the refrigator , " @entity235 said			0
" it stays in the family ... and as doctors , we can not interfere			0
" @entity65 , the district governor of @entity67 , told @entity2 an arrest warrant has been issued for @entity27 , who is on the loose			0
but @entity3 says that is not enough			0
" the state is guilty , the system is guilty , " she says			2
" it failed to protect the victim			2
" the governor of @entity40 and @entity1 's minister of state responsible for women 's and family affairs did not respond to numerous requests from @entity2 to comment on the case			1
both officials have made visits to @entity33 's bedside in @entity40 hospital			0
in village of @entity29 , where many residents eke out a living herding sheep , @entity3 goes house to house , dressed in a long skirt and loose headscarf , asking locals why they did not speak up about the violence that had been taking place in their community			2
" it was n't our responsibility , " insists @entity280 , a brother of the village muhtar , or mayor			0
" when there is violence , it does n't matter if it 's your relative , " @entity3 responds			2
" you can still make a call and inform that this woman is being beaten			0
