-- whether you like him or not , or think that his dominance is bad for @entity5 , there 's no denying that @entity6 is simply unstoppable this season			1
even his teammate @entity8 , with whom the @entity10 's relations have never been warm , admits that @entity6 is " in another category			1
" the four - time world champion won by more than 30 seconds in @entity13 , having started sunday 's race second on the grid behind his veteran @entity17 colleague			1
while @entity8 bounced back from yet another poor start to ensure a 15th 1 - 2 for the team -- he has only won once from nine poles -- @entity6 motored clear once again while his rivals scrapped for minor placings			1
it was the 26 - year - old 's seventh successive win , matching his personal best of 11 victories in a season			1
with two races left on the calendar , he can match @entity31 's record of nine in a row in 1952 - 53 and @entity34 's 2004 feat of 13 in one season			1
" the car was absolutely brilliant			0
there is not much more to say			0
i was flying at stages -- at least it felt like it -- and there were some massive gaps , which was a big surprise , " @entity6 said			2
@entity6 has been booed on the podium several times this year -- no doubt in part due to the @entity48 incident when he ignored team orders and passed @entity8 for victory -- but he celebrated at @entity51 as he did in @entity52 last weekend on clinching a fourth straight title , with wheelspins			1
@entity17 paid the first fine , but @entity6 -- who earns a reported $ 16 million yearly salary -- will have to take this one after the 37th victory of his young career			1
" i think @entity6 can pay the fine this week , " team principal @entity59 said			2
" that was a champion 's drive			0
" @entity8 , who is quitting @entity5 at the end of this season , could only pay tribute after being forced to settle for second -- as he did in @entity66 last month after starting on pole			2
" the start was n't great , " said the 37 - year - old , who held off @entity70 ' third - placed @entity69 and @entity72 ' @entity71 in fourth			2
" @entity69 got an unbelievable start and @entity75 's was a bit better than mine			2
on the first stint we were not strong enough on the soft tires			0
" after that the race went pretty well for me but @entity75 was gone -- he was in another category up front			0
i had a nice little battle with @entity69 for second			0
" i think he ( @entity6 ) is in a sweet spot , for sure			0
in the end , i did my best today and this was my overall personal best around here			0
" @entity70 stayed second ahead of @entity93 in the constructors ' standings as 2008 world champion @entity96 was seventh			1
two - time world champion @entity97 remained second in the drivers ' championship behind @entity6 after coming home fifth , working his way up from 10th at the start , while teammate @entity103 was eighth			1
@entity104 had both drivers in the points as @entity107 was sixth and @entity108 10th , while @entity110 's @entity109 was ninth as teammate @entity111 paid the price for another early scrape and ended up 12th			0
@entity111 's fellow former titleholder @entity114 had even worse day			0
excluded from qualifying -- despite setting the fifth quickest time -- after his @entity72 failed a technical test on saturday , the @entity115 did n't make it past the first lap. while @entity6 began from the pit lane in similar circumstances last year to finish third , @entity114 -- who is joining @entity93 next season after a pay dispute with @entity72 -- started with the tailenders and a ding with a @entity125 ended his hopes of repeating his 2012 success in the race			2
" we did n't touch hard , but i think the angle was very unlucky and it broke the steering , " @entity114 said .			0
