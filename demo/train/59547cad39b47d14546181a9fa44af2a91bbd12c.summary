@entity0 -- the @entity2 sided on tuesday with adoptive parents in a divisive custody fight over a @entity6 child after the biological father asserted his parental rights			1
the justices , by a 5 - 4 margin , said the adoption by a white couple was proper and did not intrude on the federal rights of the father , a registered member of the @entity16 tribe , over where his daughter , @entity17 , 3 , would live			1
the court said the father could not rely on the @entity20 for relief because he never had legal or physical custody at the time of adoption proceedings , which were initiated by the birth mother without his knowledge			1
justice @entity27 said when " the adoption of an @entity30 child is voluntarily and lawfully initiated by a @entity32 parent with sole custodial rights , the ( law 's ) primary goal of preventing unwarranted removal of @entity30 children and the dissolution of @entity30 families is not implicated			2
" the appeal was filed by @entity41 and @entity42 , who legally adopted @entity17 in 2009 shortly after the birth mother agreed to give up the child			1
she is known in court papers as " @entity46			0
" the @entity47 ruled last year for the biological father , @entity48 , who had sought custody after @entity17 's birth			2
he is a registered member of the @entity51 and is raising the child in @entity53			1
the @entity20 remains in effect , but the high court majority concluded the biological father could not apply it to his circumstances			2
the @entity2 ruling throws the issue back to the state courts , but it was not clear whether and when @entity48 would have to turn the girl over to the @entity62			1
the @entity64 , @entity65 , couple said they hope the ruling will prevent disruptions of other adoptions			1
" we are very happy with the ruling today			0
the @entity2 gave us everything that we asked for , " @entity42 told @entity1 affiliate @entity72			2
" they made it very clear that @entity17 would have never been taken from her home and from her family and that the adoption would have been approved			2
" she and @entity80 said separation from @entity17 has been difficult			0
" we are looking forward to seeing her again soon when we have the opportunity to do so , because we miss her so very much , " said @entity42			0
@entity85 , @entity17 's birth mother , also expressed satisfaction			1
" @entity41 and @entity42 are part of my family , and they have treated me like part of theirs			0
i 'm hopeful that we will all be reunited with @entity17 very soon , " the statement said			0
there was no immediate reaction from @entity48 , or the tribe			0
but @entity6 groups remained hopeful he would still keep custody			0
" while we are pleased the court has upheld @entity20 , we 're very disappointed for @entity48 , @entity17 , and the @entity105 family that the court has ruled to send the case back to the @entity65 courts on a technicality , " said @entity100 , president of the @entity101			1
" however , the courts in @entity65 have previously affirmed that @entity48 is @entity17 's father and that he is a fit parent			1
we are confident that his parental rights will be upheld and that @entity17 will stay with her family , " @entity100 said			0
the case is @entity114 , a @entity115 ( 12 - 399 )			0
