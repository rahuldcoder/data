aboard the @entity0 -- -- even before @entity3 started thrashing the @entity5 @entity4 , the @entity2 prepared for what it could do if the disaster was even more catastrophic than it proved to be			1
as @entity3 strengthened and bore down on the @entity5 , the @entity2 ordered 27 warships to sail out of its massive naval station in @entity10 , @entity11			1
another 11 ships , already at sea on various duties , were told to stay out			2
" our first mission was to sortie the fleet and keep the fleet safe , " said capt. @entity15 , commander of the @entity0 , one of the ships that left @entity10			1
like @entity22 bases that fly their planes west , moving ships to sea has become standard operating procedure for the @entity2 when major hurricanes approach			2
" ships are safer at sea than than are in port during a hurricane or heavy weather , " said @entity27			2
@entity32 , navigator of the @entity0			1
but when the @entity0 , an amphibious assault ship , headed out of @entity10 , steering clear of @entity3 was just its first objective			1
the ship was also prepared to respond with a wide array of equipment and people to the hurricane zone if civilian officials asked for help			0
" over the years we 've had so many hurricanes that devastate this country , you know we kinda get primed for being ready and responsive to it , " said rear adm. @entity42 , commander of @entity43 26 , a unit that was created to be more prepared for hurricane response than any other @entity2 unit			1
" what you are seeing is lessons learned from what has happened over the past few years , and realizing that the response that 's required for a major catastrophe -- you know like @entity58 and @entity59 -- requires all the resources that the nation has to bear , " @entity42 said			1
those resources were focused on the @entity0 , one of @entity5 's largest amphibious ships			1
the ship has a full - sized flight deck , capable of launching heavy - lift or search and rescue helicopters , and a dock inside its stern , capable of carrying and launching two huge landing craft			1
those boats can move from inside the hull of the @entity0 to just about any beach and unload some 160 tons of equipment , supplies or personnel			1
and not all the help has to go to shore			0
the @entity0 , which normally carries @entity79 into combat , has a huge hospital deck			1
" we have three operating rooms			0
we can expand to four			0
we have 15 @entity85 beds that you can see here , each one with it 's own equipment , which is exactly what you would find in a normal @entity85 , " said @entity27			2
@entity92 , a doctor who is the senior medical officer on the @entity0			2
@entity92 's regular medical staff was augmented by a surgical team that was prepared to go ashore to help with any medical emergencies			0
the ship also brought a group of @entity98 , @entity2 engineers who are trained in disaster response			0
they brought along chainsaws , water pumps -- even a bulldozer			0
but putting this vast capacity of disaster aid to use depends on a twist of federal law			0
states can and did mobilize thousands of @entity111 troops to help victims of @entity3			0
but the @entity2 sailors involved in @entity43 26 are active - duty military , and they ca n't just find a crisis and start helping			0
under a system called @entity117 , local officials who want help have to ask the federal government for it			0
the president would then issue an order to the military , which would trickle down the chain of command before the @entity0 and other ships in the task force could go to work			1
this time , as bad as @entity3 was , state and local officials , as well as non-military federal agencies like the @entity130 , were able to respond without calling in the @entity2			0
but @entity42 thinks even though his task force focused on practice training , that what he saw while at sea for the past week is evidence the @entity2 is better prepared than ever			2
" over the years we 've just gotten better and better at it and poised to respond , " @entity42 said			2
but to prove that the @entity2 has gotten better , that would likely require a disaster like @entity3 ... only worse .			0

it has a full - sized flight deck , a dock inside its stern and a hospital deck
