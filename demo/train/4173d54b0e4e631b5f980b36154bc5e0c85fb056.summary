-- the enduring beauty of the @entity2 has little to do with the golf course on which it is played in a given year			1
( although the course in @entity6 , @entity7 , where the final round of this year 's @entity2 is scheduled to be played sunday , is quite a looker			1
) but the thing that sets the @entity2 apart from other top - tier championship events in big - time sports is this : you can play your way into it			1
if you 're watching the @entity2 on television this weekend , and you 're a good golfer with a handicap low enough to prove it , and you 're saying to yourself : " man , would i like to be out there competing in that thing			1
. " well , if you 're an unknown who 's not a part of the sport 's elite , and you want to give it a try and you do well enough , you 'll be there			2
dozens of golfers do it every year			0
it 's what makes the @entity2 perhaps the sporting event whose rulebook best represents the @entity39 ideal			1
there are other tournaments that open their doors to non-marquee competitors ; the @entity45 holds qualifying rounds , and this year the @entity47 has instituted a feature similar to the @entity50 's qualifying system			0
but nothing can compare with the scope and the spirit of inclusiveness of the pathway that leads to golf 's @entity2			1
every year , numerous spots in the @entity2 are reserved for players who think they 're good enough to compete with the most famous names in the game			1
this year , local qualifying rounds were held on more than 100 golf courses			1
more than 9,000 golfers filled out entry forms			0
a big , guaranteed chunk of the spots in the @entity2 was , as always , given to established stars who are exempt from having to qualify , having proven themselves in other prestigious golf events			1
but at those 100 - plus local qualifying courses , and at sectional qualifying courses that were the next level , the thousands of dreamers were welcomed			0
they could n't just stroll in and tee off			0
they had to have demonstrated that they were serious and skilled golfers ; professionals ( both playing pros and teaching pros ) are eligible to compete in the qualifying rounds , and amateurs must meet a handicapping formula devised by the @entity50			0
but once they stepped up to the first tee , the only thing between them and @entity6 was how well they played on those local and sectional courses			0
and once the best of them arrived at @entity6 , the playing field was absolutely level			0
according to @entity50 officials , half of the 156 competitors at the @entity2 this year got there through the qualifying rounds			1
they were looking out at the same 18 holes as golf 's current legends were			0
the appeal of this is that , to get into the @entity2 through the qualifying rounds , there are no admissions committees peering down their noses at you ; there is no one in an executive office telling you there 's no room for you to try			1
you do n't have to know anyone with influence in the high echelons of golf ; you do n't have to be recruited by anyone ; you do n't have to have an agent			0
you just have to have your game , and your belief in yourself			0
i 'm not a golfer ; never have been			0
but i think the reason i have always so admired the tradition of the @entity2 's qualifying rounds is that there was someone from my hometown who , at the age of 17 , played himself into the @entity2 that way			1
just four years earlier , when he was 13 , he 'd had polio			0
but he recovered , and he fought through it , and he willed himself to excel			0
i know that a lot of you probably have stories about tenacious golfers from your own towns who made it to the @entity2 one year			1
but the 17 - year - old from our town was pretty special			1
his name was @entity144 ; he did n't make the 36 - hole cut at the @entity2 that first year he qualified , but by three years later , in 1960 , at age 20 , he was paired in the final rounds with @entity148			1
in 1962 he won the @entity2 , the first of his 18 major championships			2
after qualifying in that first year , he would play in 44 consecutive @entity39 opens			2
for decades , on warm summer weekend afternoons , you could walk around his hometown and you would almost inevitably hear a sound coming from one screened - in porch or another			2
it was someone who lived in the house , calling out : " get up , @entity144 ! " @entity144 would be somewhere in the country , somewhere in the world , playing in a tournament , and he had just struck his putt , and here , back home , as on tv the ball rolled toward the cup , the person in the house would be cheering for him , willing that ball toward the hole : " get up , @entity144 ! " he may be the best golfer who ever lived , but once he was a boy , an @entity173 pharmacist 's son , dreaming of making it to the @entity2			2
he played his way in , as so many did before him , as so many have after			0
it 's the essential magic of the @entity2			2
and on sunday , as the drama of the final round at @entity6 unfolds , somewhere in the @entity39 someone will be sitting in front of a television set , thinking : i 'm good enough to be there			0
if he 's right , and he wants it badly enough to go after it , next june the @entity2 is exactly where he 'll be			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			2
