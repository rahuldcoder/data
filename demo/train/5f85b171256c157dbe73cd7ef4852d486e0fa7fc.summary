-- @entity1 and @entity2 have a proposition for us : a biopic dedicated to the memory of @entity8 activist and city supervisor @entity9 , the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in @entity11 , who was murdered by a fellow supervisor in 1978			1
@entity1 plays @entity8 city supervisor @entity9 in " milk , " directed by @entity2			1
the subject may be a tricky sell , but the timing feels right -- a few weeks late to save @entity11 ' same - sex marriage rights , admittedly , but the need to keep on fighting through adversity may be @entity9 's most important legacy			1
and " milk " is a powerful movie that will stir more than a few hearts and minds			1
an audiotape milk records " just in case " is screenwriter @entity27 's convenient structuring device , foregrounding the story 's tragic outcome and allowing milk to narrate his own life story			2
in this telling , it 's a life that begins at 40 -- when he picks up @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , falls in love , comes out and drops out			0
the year is 1970 , and @entity8 beckons			1
their @entity40 camera store soon becomes a focal point for the booming gay community , and it 's not long before @entity9 makes the first of several unsuccessful runs for district supervisor			1
civic elections might seem like small beer , but the persecution that compelled @entity9 to run for office is no trivial matter			1
the gay rights movement 's most critical accomplishment , the film suggests , is how it liberated gays to be themselves			1
as @entity9 tries to explain to his heterosexual colleague @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , this is n't about principles , it 's about people 's lives -- three of his lovers had threatened suicide			1
one of them , @entity66 ( @entity67 ) , goes through with it			0
the political ca n't get more personal than that			0
ironically , the devoutly " normal " @entity57 is the one who is truly messed up			0
here 's another irony : to earn the recognition and validation of the voters , milk has to shed his reborn hippie uniform and ponytail , put on a suit and get a haircut			2
making the same calculation , director @entity2 has axed the long takes and experimentalism that made " elephant " and " @entity83 " arresting but decidedly marginal experiences and turned in his most conventional movie since " @entity86			1
" in other words , he 's playing it straight this time			0
the strategy is sound ; the execution , nearly flawless			0
@entity2 captures the time and the place with unobtrusive precision , seamlessly mixing in reams of archival news reports			0
( she may not know it , but @entity98 has a co-starring role in this movie			2
) ireport.com : share your reviews of ' milk ' @entity1 is studied and thoughtful , impassioned and immediately sympathetic as @entity9			1
it 's easy to see how he attracts so much support -- and how his drive and commitment do n't leave enough time for a " real " life			0
when @entity1 smiles , there 's always pain there -- it 's almost a wince -- and he smiles a lot here			2
" milk " may be a little too homogenized for some tastes			0
like " @entity121 " and " @entity122 , " it 's careful how it advances its agenda ( and it does have one )			0
but it 's not just a single - issue movie			2
in its conviction that " change " is n't effected through rhetoric alone , but through the hard slog of campaign work , persuasion , inspiration , inclusion and good old , bad old politicking , " milk " says something about how progress is achieved in @entity138			0
in that respect , it evokes the best aspirations of the country -- and , for that matter , of filmmaking .			0

" milk " is a biography of openly gay @entity8 city supervisor @entity9
film works both as a subtle message film and as well - made movie
@entity1 gives *excellent* performance as milk
