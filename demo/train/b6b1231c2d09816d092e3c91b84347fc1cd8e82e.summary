-- a national group opposed to same - sex marriage aimed to fight it by driving " a wedge between gays and blacks " and identifying " glamorous " latino artists and athletes to advocate traditional marriage , according to newly released confidential memos			1
the strategies were among several pursued by the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , which has actively campaigned against same - sex marriage efforts			1
the @entity14 , a gay rights organization , said it obtained the documents , part of a civil action in @entity18 , on monday and published them on its website			2
" this court - ordered disclosure shows @entity12 fighting a losing battle with strategy and tactics that are racially and ethnically divisive , filled with false political calculations , and out of touch with the majority of fair - minded @entity29 , " @entity14 said in a statement			1
most of the memos were written in 2009			0
the president of @entity12 did not dispute the authenticity of the memos , saying in an online statement , " gay marriage is not a civil right			1
" the memos highlight several efforts to fight same - sex marriage initiatives , which @entity12 contended were backed by the " pro-gay @entity40 agenda			1
" " the @entity43 vote in @entity29 is a key swing vote , and will be so even more so in the future because of demographic growth , " one @entity12 memo states			2
" will the process of assimilation to the dominant @entity50 culture lead @entity43 to abandon traditional family values ? we can interrupt this process of assimilation by making support for marriage a key badge of @entity43 identity			1
" plans included @entity59 language radio and tv ads , pamphlets and @entity63 videos			0
@entity12 also targeted what it termed " @entity66 power bosses " it claimed were inclined to put the interests of gay rights groups " over the values of african - americans			2
" " the strategic goal of this project is to drive a wedge between gays and blacks -- two key @entity66 constituencies , " another memo states			1
" find , equip , energize and connect @entity79 - @entity29 spokespeople for marriage ; develop a media campaign around their objections to gay marriage as a civil right ; provoke the gay marriage base into responding by denouncing these spokesmen and women as bigots			2
no politician wants to take up and push an issue that splits the base of the party			0
" @entity12 argued " gay marriage is the tip of the spear , the weapon that will be and is being used to marginalize and repress @entity97 and the @entity98			2
" the organization said tuesday it was proud of its " strong record " on minority partnerships			0
@entity103 , president of @entity12 , touted the group 's work with prominent african - american and @entity108 leaders			1
" gay marriage advocates have attempted to portray same - sex marriage as a civil right , but the voices of these and many other leaders have provided powerful witness that this claim is patently false , " @entity103 said in a statement			1
" gay marriage is not a civil right , and we will continue to point this out in written materials such as those released in @entity18			0
we proudly bring together people of different races , creeds and colors to fight for our most fundamental institution : marriage			0
" @entity12 has been instrumental in the campaign to stop same - sex marriage laws , including @entity18			1

the release of @entity12 documents follows the successful 2009 efforts to overturn @entity18 's same - sex marriage law			1
