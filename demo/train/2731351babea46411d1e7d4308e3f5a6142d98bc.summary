-- the @entity2 government thursday announced its highest penalty for coal mine safety violations , $ 1.85 million , for a collapse that killed six miners in @entity7 last year			1
supervisory mining engineer @entity8 on thursday describes the earth movements at @entity10			1
insufficient pillar support and activity in areas that should not have been mined caused the august @entity10 mine collapse , federal investigators found			1
the government fined the mine operator , @entity10 , $ 1.34 million " for violations that directly contributed to the deaths of six miners last year , " plus nearly $ 300,000 for other violations			1
the government also levied a $ 220,000 fine against a mining consultant , @entity24 , " for faulty analysis of the mine 's design			1
" the mine 's owner had insisted that earth movement detected at the time of the collapse had caused the disaster			1
but investigators found instead that the collapse caused the earth movement			0
" it was not -- and i repeat , it was not -- a natural occurring earthquake , " said the government 's top mine safety official , @entity37			2
@entity37 , the acting assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health , said , " pillars failed under excessive load and ejected coal very violently			0
" @entity37 also said the mine 's operator " was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor			1
" " this dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support , " @entity37 said			0
in addition to the six miners killed in the initial cave - in august 6 in northwest @entity59 , three would - be rescuers died 10 days later in a subsequent collapse			2
the bodies of the six miners killed in the initial collapse were never recovered			2
@entity64 , the lead investigator for the government , said the pillars in the mine " simply were not large enough to support the load			0
" that resulted in a " catastrophic failure of pillars over a broad area , " as large as half a mile , he said			0
@entity75 scientists said in june that the collapse was not the result of an earthquake			0
" as seismologists , we 're as certain as we can be that the seismic event registered as a magnitude - 3.9 shock was due to the collapse of the mine and not a naturally occurring earthquake , " said @entity79 , director of the university 's @entity80 , in a written statement			2
earlier this year , a @entity90 report criticized @entity92 officials for approving plans for a risky mining technique , known as retreat mining , that was in use before the collapse			0
in the process , miners remove pillars of coal that support the roof of a chamber one by one , allowing the roof to collapse behind them			0
mine owner @entity105 repeatedly denied in the days after the disaster that his company practiced retreat mining at @entity10			1
he later admitted that the practice had been used at the mine but said it was not being done at the time of the disaster .			0

feds : violations by @entity7 mine 's operator led to 2007 collapse that killed six
bad design , *improper* mining led to @entity10 collapse , feds say
mine operator fined more than $ *1.5* million
