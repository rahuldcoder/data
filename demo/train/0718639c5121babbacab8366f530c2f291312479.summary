@entity0 -- high - level talks to defuse the @entity4 crisis , due to be held by the @entity5 , @entity6 , the @entity7 and the @entity9 government next week , amount to a big personal test for @entity12 after a notably accident - prone first year as @entity5 president @entity14 's secretary of state			1
@entity12 's @entity15 failed to see the @entity4 crisis coming and may have inadvertently helped to provoke it			1
they pushed too hard as the @entity7 moved to cement closer ties with the former @entity21 republic			0
then , when @entity4 's elected , @entity23 president was forcibly overthrown , the @entity5 barely concealed its satisfaction			1
the conviction that @entity26 deliberately engineered the @entity9 " coup " predictably enraged @entity6 president @entity28			1
he decided he would try a bit of direct intervention of his own			0
the result was last month 's annexation of @entity35 and the apparent , continuing @entity6 military threat to eastern @entity4			1
key international issues there is a bit of a pattern emerging here			0
in november last year , during a @entity44 tour , @entity12 gave his backing to the military junta that deposed the country 's elected @entity48 president , @entity50 , and brutally repressed thousands of his supporters			1
@entity12 declared that @entity41 was following a " roadmap " back to democracy and that @entity53 , the general in charge , enjoyed his confidence			2
since then , the repression has only gotten worse , and @entity41 democracy has become a bad joke			0
hundreds of @entity48 supporters were sentenced to death in risibly unfair court trials , amid a widening crackdown on political dissent and independent media			0
@entity53 now plans to become president			0
@entity12 has become more critical , but the die is cast			2
very soon , @entity41 will have a new dictator to replace former @entity41 president @entity69 , only younger and potentially more vicious			0
this dire prospect is not what the @entity71 was about , and surely not what the @entity14 administration intended			0
@entity12 's judgment has not proved any more impressive in his handling of several other key international issues			1
he threw his weight behind the @entity80 peace talks process after receiving encouragement , ironically , from @entity28 , who is @entity80 president @entity83 's main external backer			1
but it seems the wily @entity6 leader saw @entity12 coming from way off			1
@entity86 continued to aid , abet and arm the @entity83 regime while the @entity5 - backed opposition groups squabbled and split and eventually achieved next to nothing in the @entity91 talks			0
@entity12 's plan to discuss a transitional government in @entity94 never got to first base			1
out of touch @entity12 invested a surprising amount of personal capital in reviving peace negotiations between @entity100 and the @entity101 , making optimistic prognostications about his chances of success where so many others have failed			1
perhaps it was a generational thing			0
@entity12 , aged 70 , has lived with the @entity107 all of his professional life			2
when he finally became secretary of state , maybe he thought : " at last , i have my chance to fix this			0
" but he has n't			0
in fact , following the @entity114 's decision last week to seek @entity116 - recognized statehood , and the @entity100 government 's reaction in breaking off most contacts , the situation is rapidly deteriorating again			2
@entity12 's behavior in all these cases was delusional and out of touch with the realities on the ground , as the @entity127 's @entity126 has argued , saying : " @entity41 is under the thumb of an authoritarian general			1
the @entity80 peace talks imploded soon after they began			0
the @entity100 - @entity114 negotiations are hanging by a thread			0
all along the way , @entity12 -- thanks to a profound misreading of the realities on the ground -- was enabling the bad guys			2
" now @entity12 faces his biggest challenge -- persuading , or forcing , another bad guy ( namely @entity28 ) to back off in @entity4 at a time when the @entity6 leader seems ever more convinced of @entity5 weakness			1
according to @entity143 , a former @entity14 state department official speaking thursday to the @entity144 , @entity28 formed that opinion , rightly or wrongly , when the @entity5 ducked military action in @entity80 last year			1
now he appears to believe @entity26 , and therefore @entity147 , will avoid a physical confrontation over @entity4 at all costs , and that this gives him a clear negotiating advantage			2
ahead of next week 's talks , @entity12 could be misreading the situation again			1
he evidently did not believe @entity6 would be so audacious as to annex @entity35			1
now , judging by recent statements , he is getting it wrong again			0
he seems to believe @entity28 is on the point of ordering similar action in eastern @entity4 , where pro-russia separatists have seized government buildings and appealed for @entity6 armed intervention			1
testifying to @entity161 this week , @entity12 blamed the protests on " special forces and agents " sent by @entity86 in a move he said " could potentially be a contrived pretext for military intervention just as we saw in @entity35			1
" while the @entity5 favored a diplomatic solution , @entity26 was ready " to do what is necessary " to maintain international order			0
@entity28 must chortle at such empty - sounding rhetoric			2
he believes , with good reason , that the @entity5 and its allies will not go to war over @entity4			2
he probably also has no intention of sending in his tanks , simply because he does not need to			0
the direct and indirect pressure on @entity9 to bow to @entity6 demands for " constitutional reform , " including some form of federal system and enhanced regional autonomy in the east , is massive and beginning to tell			2
it is backed up by powerful @entity6 economic leverage , especially over gas supplies and agricultural exports			2
@entity4 is broke and divided			2
it has neither an elected government nor president			0
it is militarily vastly inferior			0
and it lacks allies it can rely upon , when the chips are down			0
like it or not , it has little choice but to seek an accommodation with @entity6			1
unless @entity12 significantly raises his game , the terms will be dictated by @entity28			1
opinion : @entity41 's @entity53 manufactures new dictatorship opinion : for many @entity41 , there is no alternative but el - @entity207			0

@entity12 's state department failed to see the @entity4 crisis coming , writes @entity211
he evidently did not believe @entity6 would be so audacious as to annex @entity35 , he says
@entity211 : @entity4 has little choice but to seek an accommodation with @entity6
unless @entity12 raises his game , the terms will be dictated by @entity28 , writes @entity211
