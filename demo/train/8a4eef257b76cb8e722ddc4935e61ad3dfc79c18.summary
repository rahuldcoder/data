@entity0 , @entity1 -- " this is an event in world history , " is how @entity6 producer @entity5 hyperbolically proclaimed the news that @entity8 and @entity9 were to star in his new film			1
@entity8 and @entity9 in a scene from their new movie " @entity14 , " out this fall			1
@entity5 can , perhaps , be forgiven for getting a little carried away			2
after all , it 's not every day these two @entity6 greats appear together on screen			2
@entity5 is fully aware that by getting @entity8 and @entity9 to pair up in his latest venture " @entity14 , " he has hit movie paydirt			1
" they were in two scenes in ' @entity22			2
' in this movie , they are in the whole thing together , " he tells @entity25 magazine			2
the pairing of heavyweight actors @entity9 and @entity31 film festival founder @entity8 is something which has tantalized film fans since their separate scenes in " @entity35 " -- 34 years ago			1
with 115 films and three @entity38 between them , the two stars first acted together in the 1995 thriller " @entity22 , " albeit very briefly in two unrehearsed scenes			2
so " @entity14 " is something of a coup for @entity6 director and producer @entity44 , who made 1996 's " @entity47 " and 1991 's " @entity46			1
" the longtime friends will star as two veteran @entity50 detectives on the hunt for a vigilante who may be one of their own			2
it is prime @entity8 / @entity9 territory , as @entity5 acknowledges in a recent interview with the @entity58			1
he says : " they 're playing @entity50 detectives ; they are as @entity50 as it gets			0
@entity8 and @entity9 the way you want to see them			1
" " they 're both very opaque , " he adds			0
" you do n't know whether they 're going to kiss someone or kill them			0
and that suspense is what makes their performances so intense in the moment			0
" " @entity14 " is a remake of a hit @entity75 thriller , " @entity81 " -- the address of the @entity75 cid in @entity84 -- which also saw the pairing of @entity78 cinema kings @entity79 and @entity80			1
@entity8 , 67 , said the film , to be released in september , came about because of their longstanding friendship and a desire to work on a longer project together			1
" we are old friends , and he is a terrific person and great to work with and that was it you know , it was great , " he told @entity2 's " @entity97 " at the opening of the tribeca film festival in @entity50			2
" because the other movie that we did , we had one great scene			0
i loved the scene we had where we meet in the restaurant and then the end of the movie			0
" and ' @entity105 ' we were in the same movie but two different time periods , so we are in a movie now where we actually work a lot together			0
" @entity9 , who recently turned 68 , says their friendship enhances the acting experience			1
" i love @entity114 , so it 's fun , " he told @entity113			0
" i 've known him since i was a little boy			0
@entity114 wisely did n't want to rehearse our first scene together , on ' @entity22			0
' and i 'm glad he did n't			0
there 's a comfort level that 's very important			0
" you can rehearse till the cows come home but that comfort level is what it 's about			0
" although the prospect of seeing @entity6 icons such as @entity8 and @entity9 on screen is one to savor for many fans , some have questioned whether this new film will be anything to write home about , based on the quality of their recent output			1
the two acting legends have come under fire for making questionable " payday " movie choices like @entity9 's critically panned " 88 minutes " -- also produced by @entity5 and directed by @entity138			1
reviews for @entity8 in films like " analyze that , " " @entity142 " and " godsend " have been similarly scathing			1
some argue , perhaps unfairly , that their body of work has become so polluted by poor choices , that many have forgotten what made them so great in the first place			0
perhaps this is what prompted long time collaborator @entity153 , who directed @entity9 and @entity8 in " @entity105 " trilogy , to accuse them , along with @entity156 , of lacking ambition and passion			1
@entity153 was quoted in @entity159 last year as saying : " i do n't feel that kind of passion to do a role and be great coming from those guys , because if it was there , they would do it ! i mean , they 're all in a position to do it			0
" @entity153 later told reporters during the @entity170 that the comments were " obviously bent out of shape " by the magazine			0
" i was astonished because it was n't true , " he said			0
" i have nothing but respect and admiration for the actors			2
these are the three greatest actors in the world today , and they are my friends			2
" however , his supposed views obviously struck a chord with others			0
in march , @entity8 came top in a poll by the online edition of @entity113 to find " the most shameless pay check role			1
" he won for agreeing to play @entity187 in @entity188 in 2000			0
while @entity58 , film critic @entity189 accused the pair of " becoming parodies of themselves , making payday movies that are hollow echoes of the electrically charged work they did on such films as ' @entity196 , ' ' @entity197 , ' ' @entity198 ' and ' @entity199			1
' " he added : " if anyone has made more movies for the money than @entity9 , it would be @entity8 , who has largely abandoned serious dramatic work for a spate of forgettable horror and crime thrillers			1
" between them @entity9 and @entity8 have starred in some of best films ever made , and as they approach their 70s , it would be fair to say they have earned the right to slum it a little			1
and as @entity219 of the @entity221 newspaper puts it : " do n't we all find the armchair that bit comfier as the years go by ? " why should @entity8 be any different just because he made his name as one of the most visceral and searching of screen performers ? " e-mail to a friend			2

@entity9 , @entity8 *co-starring* in " @entity14 "
two actors have *co-starred* in movies , but *rarely* shared scenes
some have questioned whether the film is worthy of their talents
