a little boy dying in a car 's back seat			2
an old woman writhing in the street			2
desperate people waiting at home for ambulances that never came			0
the suffering they experienced was unimaginable -- until he felt it himself			0
@entity0 was a day into working in @entity14 as a freelance cameraman for @entity16 when he first fell ill from what turned out to be @entity2			1
he tested positive for the virus in that @entity20 country , before being flown to @entity21 back in the @entity22			1
he suffered , but survived			0
after it all , he finally fully grasped the plight of those he 'd seen outside treatment centers in @entity14 , too weak to move			1
" they were just laying out on the ground , in the gravel , in the sun , and i used to look at them and say , ' my @entity36 , you ca n't sit up at least ? ' " @entity0 told @entity28 's @entity27 on wednesday from his native @entity29			1
" and then once i was sick , i completely understood			0
you just have absolutely no energy			1
to walk three feet feels like you just ran a marathon			0
" like anyone else , @entity0 had been sick before			1
and this time around , he had body aches , chills and a fever up to 104 degrees			2
" but ( the symptoms ) were so pronounced and so much more intense than anything that you 're likely to get with the flu , " he said			0
" ( @entity2 ) is definitely different			1
" ebola survivor : @entity49 is ' playing politics ' a @entity51 , an activist , a journalist thankfully , things are different now for @entity0			1
on october 21 , he tweeted that he 'd tested negative for @entity2 for three straight days			1
that meant he could finally leave the hospital and go home			0

a graduate of @entity68 and the @entity69 , he worked for years with the advocacy group , @entity70			0
he 's a proud @entity51 who , according to a 2009 documentary , took the honorary title among @entity74 of @entity75			0
" i still think i can be of some kind of benefit to somebody , " he said then			0
" and that 's , i think , what being a @entity51 is about			0
" @entity0 had an especially deep connection with @entity14 , having worked for two years there for the nonprofit @entity82			1
so when the @entity2 crisis hit there and in two neighboring @entity20 nations , he felt compelled to act			1
" he ... really made a strong connection to the @entity14 people , and ... wanted to go back and see if he could make a difference , " his father , dr. @entity85 , said earlier this month			2
his contributions in spreading @entity14 ' stories date back to july , in a piece for @entity95 entitled , " why do n't @entity91 believe @entity2 is real ?

tests at a @entity105 facility the next day confirmed the worst : that he had @entity2			2

" " they 're so brave and such heroes , " he said of this and other health care workers who tended for him			0
" i could see that they were afraid , but they were willing to take that risk for me to ... help me survive			0
" more help came with his arrival , days later , in the @entity22			0
he went straight into strict isolation , unable to see his family and with all those helping him dressed head - to - toe in protective gear			2
asked by @entity28 's @entity27 about not having human contact while in treatment , @entity0 said he did n't know what that " would have done for me at that point			2
" " i needed my own strength so much that , to be touched and cared for , i 'm not even sure i would have wanted that , " he said			0
" ... i was so scared and sick that i think i needed to be in some kind of bubble			0
" @entity0 got more help from someone who 'd suffered like him : dr. @entity141 , an @entity22 doctor who also contracted @entity2 in @entity14			1
a day after getting a blood transfusion from @entity141 , @entity0 said he " started to feel better " with less of a headache and more energy			1
now , @entity0 wants to return the favor to someone else with @entity2			1
" i ca n't give blood for another two weeks , i think , " he said , explaining that his antibody count is n't strong enough yet to be useful			0
