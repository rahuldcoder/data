-- a @entity2 ship detects pulse signals deep in the @entity4 at the same frequency used by so - called black boxes like the one aboard missing @entity7			1
after almost a month of fruitless searching , hopes mount for final answers about what happened to the plane carrying 239 people that disappeared almost a month ago			1
however , experts disagree whether saturday 's news is a breakthrough or another dead end , raising new questions about what the pulse signal means and what happens now			1
is this it ? maybe			0
the signals reported -- 37.5 khz -- " is the standard beacon frequency " for the plane 's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder , said @entity23 , president of pinger manufacturer @entity24			1
that frequency was chosen for use in the recorders " to give that standout quality that does not get interfered with by the background noise that readily occurs in the ocean			0
" @entity2 's @entity37 reported the detector deployed by the @entity39 ( pronounced " high shuen " ) 01 patrol ship picked up the first signal around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude , adding " it is yet to be established whether it is related to the missing jet			1
" that location is outside the previously announced search areas for the missing plane off the western coast of @entity51 in the @entity4			1
a @entity2 search plane also reported seeing white objects on the ocean surface , according to @entity37			1
later saturday , the head of the @entity56 in @entity51 that is overseeing the search said there was " no confirmation at this stage that the signals and the objects are related to the missing aircraft			1
" the statement said the floating objects were 90 kilometers , or about 55 miles , from where the pulse signal was detected			2
relatives react what 's the difference between the devices ? the most recent finds came from a @entity2 ship slowly moving through the southern @entity4			1
so what was it doing ? video on @entity2 state - run @entity77 shot saturday shows crew members from the @entity39 01 boarding a small yellow dinghy and using what appears to be a handheld hydrophone			1
the three men on board lower the device into the water on a pole			2
a @entity77 correspondent aboard the @entity89 01 reported that the first 37.5 kh signal was detected for 90 seconds			2
@entity0 spoke to the @entity92 company that makes such devices			0
handheld pinger locating devices were first built for scuba use , said @entity97 , senior director of business operations for @entity99			0
the equipment starts at a list price of about $ 8,000 ; with all the options it costs about $ 16,000 , according to the company			0
@entity97 said holding the device over the side of a vessel may not be the best option , but it should work			2
the handheld device used by the @entity2 is much different from the @entity110 hydrophone -- or underwater microphone -- called a towed pinger locator			1
one is on board the @entity51 ship @entity115 , which recently joined the search for @entity7			0
this high - tech listening device can glide along near the bottom of the sea			1
the towed pinger locator , or @entity121 , is 30 inches long and weighs just 70 pounds			0
it 's towed behind the ship that generally moves at slow speeds , generally from 1 to 5 knots			2
the device can pick up the pinger sound in depths reaching 20,000 feet			1
a pinger can be detected at a range of 1 to 2 miles			0
the @entity121 is more sensitive , more expensive and , since it is towed in the ocean , will have a better detection range , said @entity133 , vice president and group general manager for @entity135			0
" one is designed to find a pinger in deep water , the other is designed to find a pinger in shallow water , " said @entity133			0
what now ? searchers need more equipment in the area where the pulse signal was detected to determine if it comes from airplane wreckage			0
it is a race against time , because the batteries for the acoustic pingers on flight 370 could run out soon			0
they are expected to last at least a month once a plane goes down , but would then begin to lose strength			1
according to @entity159 officials , the batteries on the missing plane were due to be replaced in june under a regular maintenance schedule			2
what happens after the pingers die ? " i 'd like to see some additional assets on site quickly -- maybe some sonobuoys , " @entity23 said , referring to 5 - inch - long ( 13 - centimeter ) sonar systems that are dropped from aircraft or ships			0
confirmation that the signal comes from the @entity172 @entity171 would mean " the possibility of recovering the plane -- or at least the black boxes -- goes from being one in a million to almost certain , " said @entity176 , a lecturer in ocean and earth science at the @entity179			0
up to 10 military planes and three civilian aircraft -- in addition to 11 ships -- searched saturday for any sign of flight 370 , according to @entity51 officials			0
the @entity189 submarine @entity190 was in the search area , @entity159 's acting transport minister said			0
retired air chief marshal @entity192 , the chief coordinator of the @entity56 , said officials were considering deploying search assets to the specific area where the @entity2 ship detected the pulse signal			1
@entity198 : never had a story with ' so few facts , so much speculation ' @entity0 's @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 contributed to this report .			2

pulse signals may be from the *airliner* with 239 people aboard missing for almost a month
they also could be some other pulse - *emitting* device or even natural sound
experts disagree on the likelihood the plane has been found
some question the report by @entity2 's state - run news agency
