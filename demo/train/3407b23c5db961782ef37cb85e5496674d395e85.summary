@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity9 's accident prone " @entity8 " is just one of hundreds of unexplained sightings in the same area where a wind turbine was wrecked over the weekend , according to the latest reports			1
the @entity13 tabloid newspaper 's @entity8 splash			1
@entity9 's tabloid @entity13 newspaper thursday proclaimed from its front page that a wind turbine was ruined after a @entity8 hit one of its 20 meter - long blades in @entity19 , @entity20			1
it quoted residents who saw strange balls of lights in the sky and heard a loud bang			2
however , another @entity9 national newspaper said the lights were just fireworks from a staff member 's dad 's birthday celebration			1
turbine experts suggested it was a simple mechanical failure			1
the plot thickened further friday , with @entity13 saying it had been " bombarded " with reports of @entity8 sightings from hundreds of witnesses in the area where the turbine was destroyed			1
watch video on the @entity8 incident " there have been reports of flying saucers for more than six months , " the newspaper said			1
local @entity46 , 32 , told @entity13 he looked out of his window and saw " a massive ball of light with tentacles going right down to the ground			2
" the newspaper said " other respected witnesses , such as local council chairman @entity53 and gp @entity54 , described seeing ' streaking white lights '			2
" quoting unnamed @entity58 " insiders , " @entity13 said the @entity8 sightings may be an unmanned stealth bomber on test flights			1
it said the @entity64 " black delta - wing craft " was being developed nearby to deliver bombs undetected in war zones ; back to the testing board then ? however , initial reports when the @entity64 contract was let last year said it would take at least four years to develop with flight testing due 2010 ... in @entity69			2
@entity2 has also been " bombarded " with messages , but mainly from people less than convinced			1
@entity72 believed there was a very simple explanation			0
" the octopus thing obviously thought the wind turbine was a female doing a mating dance and tried to mate with it			1
" @entity80 was worried the aliens did not " know how to drive a flying octopus			0
" @entity83 was worried what the aliens might think about the fuss			0
" well , let 's hope there is intelligent life watching us			2
it would at least prove there is intelligence somewhere			0
" @entity94 , who lives near the turbines , had a simple explanation for the lights			0
" on sunday there was a very spectacular meteor shower , like fireworks on the horizontal			0
" @entity102 was unimpressed with some of the explanations -- and your writer			0
" listen , just report the story and follow through			0
think you can do that ? without screwing up ? the plausible explanations are absurd			0
you are going to tell me that the residents of the area are not going to recognize fireworks ? this is a ridiculous and insulting explanation and it sounds exactly like that , offensive and ridiculous			0
i do n't know if there was a @entity8 or not , but it is all rather odd			1
what i do know is that the arrogant tone has got to stop			0
" is it life @entity122 but not as we know it ? @entity124 us up your thoughts .			0
