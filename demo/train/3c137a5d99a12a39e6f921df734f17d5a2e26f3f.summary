-- should @entity1 , the legendary @entity3 general and 18th president of the @entity4 , be bumped from his 96 - year stint on the $ 50 bill ? yes , according to one @entity8 @entity7			1
rep. @entity9 announced that he will introduce a measure that would replace @entity1 's face with @entity12 's , just in time for the 40th president 's 100th birthday next february			1
" president @entity12 was a modern day statesman , whose presidency transformed our nation 's political and economic thinking , " @entity9 said in a statement			1
" through both his domestic and international policies he renewed @entity4 's self confidence , defeated the @entity22 and taught us that each generation must provide opportunity for the next			2
" @entity9 says it 's only logical for @entity12 to replace @entity1 on the $ 50 bill because several historians have ranked @entity12 as a much better president than @entity1			1
@entity9 specifically cites a 2005 @entity31 survey of scholars who placed @entity12 at @entity33 and @entity1 at no. 29			1
" every generation needs its own heroes , " @entity9 also said			0
" one decade into the 21st century , it 's time to honor the last great president of the 20th and give president @entity12 a place beside presidents @entity40 and @entity42			2
" @entity40 's face currently appears on the dime while @entity42 's image is on the half - dollar			2
but not so fast , says dr. @entity47 , the executive director and managing editor of the @entity49			0
calling him a " beacon " of the 19th century , @entity47 said @entity1 deserves to keep his prominent spot on @entity4 's currency			1
" his work in battling against inflation and getting the currency on stable footing opened the way for the economy boom of the late 19th century , @entity47 told @entity0			0
" i do n't know why he would n't be included , except people forget			0
it 's been a long time			0
" @entity47 also named a host of other @entity1 accomplishments , including efforts to promote the rights of freed slaves and native americans , as well as his post-presidency , two - year tour of the world during which he negotiated the settlement of a dispute between @entity73 and @entity74			0
but the @entity1 administration was also beset by major scandals -- close to a dozen in all -- which is a primary reason that @entity1 had difficulty working with @entity79 and why many modern historians continue to rank the 18th president relatively low			1
still , @entity47 says @entity1 's death in 1885 was a " national phenomenon " and is " still the biggest funeral any @entity4 has had to this day			2
" @entity1 supporters can rest easy for now , though -- the future of the legislation is highly in doubt			0
it would first have to clear the @entity90 where at least one @entity91 is already expressing his opposition to the move			2
" history has made its verdict , " rep. @entity94 of @entity95 told @entity0			0
" @entity12 's policies are controversial			2
@entity1 was in favor of winning the @entity100 and keeping the @entity3 together			0
the currency is not a place to score cheap political points			0
" it 's not the first time @entity7 lawmakers have sought to immortalize @entity12 's image on @entity4 currency			1
in 2004 , rep. @entity109 introduced legislation to put @entity12 on the dime in place of @entity40			1
@entity109 dropped the move after @entity114 publicly opposed the measure			0
in the years since @entity12 's death , @entity7 lawmakers have also considered , though abandoned , legislation placing @entity12 on the $ 10 bill , in place of @entity121 , and on the $ 20 bill , in place of @entity124 .			1
