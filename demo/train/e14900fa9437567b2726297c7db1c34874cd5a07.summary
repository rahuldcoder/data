@entity0 -- there was a time in the 1960s and 70s when @entity4 seemed to be everywhere in @entity5			1
the @entity7 television personality with his trademark white - blonde hair was the face of " @entity11 " and " @entity12 'll fix it			1
" families would sit down with their children to watch @entity4 in their homes			1
so when nine - year - old @entity16 learned his scout troop would be featured on @entity19 's show in 1974 , he was absolutely thrilled			1
@entity16 told @entity1 : " he was almost @entity20 - like			1
everyone was writing to ' @entity12 'll fix it			2
' when i told people at school , they just did n't believe it			2
when they knew we was going on , he was just fantastic			0
he was the person every child , certainly , wanted to know			2
" after the show , @entity16 presented a tie to @entity34 as a present			1
that 's when he says @entity4 asked him if he would like his own " @entity12 'll fix it " badge			1
according to @entity16 , @entity19 lead him backstage at @entity7 studios into a small , cluttered dressing room and sat him down in a chair			1
profile : from national treasure to reviled ' abuser ' " he said to me : ' you want your own badge ? ' i said : ' yeah			0
' he said : ' you want to earn your badge ? ' " @entity4 proceeded to molest him , he says , undoing his boy scout uniform and fondling him			1
it was only interrupted when someone opened the door and peeked in , apologized and immediately walked out			0
that , he says , is when @entity4 issued this threat : " he said , ' do n't you dare tell anyone about this			1
no one will believe you because i 'm @entity60			0
do n't tell your mates			0
we know where you live			0
' and that 's it			0
that 's the last i ever spoke to him , " @entity16 told @entity1			1

" when i first heard , i thought , ' @entity20			0
' i blamed myself for 37 years			0
that 's the first thing you do			0
but i was realizing it 's not my fault			0
do you tell anyone ? i do n't want to tell anyone else but my wife , i thought			0

@entity4 died in 2011 , and @entity16 has no hope of bringing him to justice			1
but he does want an investigation into what @entity7 executives knew - and when -- about @entity19 's alleged predatory behavior , and whether they could have stopped it			2
" i feel hatred towards them , " he says of the @entity7			2
" somebody must have known something			0
obviously it was just covered up			0
that 's disgraceful because , i do n't know when it was known , but if it was [ before ] my incident , this might not have happened to me			0
