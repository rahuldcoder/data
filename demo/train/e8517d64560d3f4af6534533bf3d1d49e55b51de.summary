@entity1 , @entity0 -- scientists think they have uncovered conclusive proof that human activity is responsible for rising temperatures in both polar regions			1
changes in polar temperatures are not consistent with natural climate changes say scientists			1
@entity11 carried out at the @entity12 at the @entity14 's @entity13 ( @entity13 ) demonstrates for the first time that anthropogenic climate change is responsible for warming at the @entity17 and @entity18			1
previous studies have observed rises in temperature at both poles , but none , until now , have formally attributed the cause to human activity			0
using up - to - date gridded data sets , scientists led by the @entity13 observed mean land surface temperatures in the @entity17 over a 100 year period			0
for the @entity18 the observation period was shorter -- 50 years -- as there is no station data available before 1945			2
they then applied an average simulated response using two models			0
the first examined natural forcings -- events like solar cycles and volcanic activity which can affect temperatures			2
the second model simulated natural combined with anthropogenic forcings -- which included greenhouse gases , stratospheric ozone depletion and sulphate aerosol			2
scientists discovered that the observed changes in @entity17 and @entity18 temperatures are not consistent with internal climate variability or natural climate drivers alone			1
one of the report authors , dr @entity51 told @entity2 : " in both cases the accelerations are not consistent with natural forcing , which means that natural forcing alone can not produce such a warming			1
so in a sense , we can say conclusively that this [ warming trend at the poles ] is due to human influence			0
" the paper " attribution of polar warming to human influence " is published in the science journal @entity65			1
the @entity18 data is of particular interest given that the @entity73 's @entity72 in 2007 notes that anthropogenic climate change had been detected in every continent except @entity18			2
this new data appears to demonstrate that man - made warming is indeed happening on the continent as well			0
the report may go some way towards silencing climate skeptics who point to evidence that most of @entity18 has been cooling for some time			1
" there is strong warming in the @entity18 peninsula , " @entity51 said			1
" but for several decades there has been a slight cooling of the rest of the continent			0
this slight cooling is due to circulation changes which are partly caused by ozone depletion			2
" this is why there has been a bit of confusion as to what is happening in @entity18			2
but we expect a recovery of the ozone layer in the future			1
we may also expect that the @entity18 warming trends will emerge more clearly			1
" commenting on the study conducted by the @entity13 , professor @entity105 , a glaciologist at the @entity106 told @entity2 : " this is exactly the sort of study we need			0
the poles are extremely important in the climate change debate and the rapid warming in the @entity17 is one of the icons			0
" professor @entity105 , who is studying the patches of warming happening in @entity18 , concedes that the cooling that 's occurred in the past 30 to 50 years is " a little perplexing "			1
but he agrees with dr @entity51 over the effects of the ozone hole			1
" the likelihood is that over the next century the ozone hole will be substantially reduced , " professor @entity105 said , " and it may mean that the @entity18 warming becomes much more apparent in that period			1
" climate modeling might not convince everyone that warming is taking place , but as professor @entity105 points out : " simulations are built around physical principles and an understanding of the physical world "			0
climate modeling is a relatively new area of expertise but professor @entity105 said that the @entity13 is widely recognized as one of the world leaders in this field			0
as previous @entity73 reports have pointed out , the effects of warming at the poles are already being felt by indigenous polar species and communities			2
this new report is confirmation of the culpability of humans in contributing to these rising temperatures			0
" i 'm afraid that there will always be people that do n't believe that we are making all these changes , " dr @entity51 said			1
" some people are waiting for the science to say that a particular heat wave is caused by humans			0
but attributing specific effects to human activities is much more difficult than attributing global changes			0
i do n't know if we should wait for that because it will be too late			0
" i see from the data that there is warming			0

scientist claim to have uncovered proof that polar warming is influenced by humans
dr @entity51 : " the accelerations are not consistent with natural forcing "
recent cooling in parts of @entity18 expected to *reverse* once ozone layer recovers
