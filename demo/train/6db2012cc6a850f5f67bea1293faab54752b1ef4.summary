@entity0 -- @entity2 symbolizes for many republicans of his generation a passing of the torch and a call to embrace the @entity9 - era principles that appealed so strongly to young voters in the 1980s			1
the @entity12 congressman evoked both when he took the stage on wednesday night and delivered a prime - time acceptance speech at the @entity15 that skewered what the @entity16 sees as president @entity19 's failed economic policies			1
with @entity2 , 42 , holding down the no. 2 spot , the ticket hopes to strengthen his @entity23 demographic ahead of november and broaden the campaign 's appeal to a wealth of younger voters , a much more challenging prospect			1
during his speech , @entity2 spoke directly to young voters ' economic concerns			1
" @entity32 have graduated from college during the @entity19 presidency , ready to use their gifts and get moving in life			0
half of them ca n't find the work they studied for , or any work at all , " @entity2 told the crowd			1
" so here 's the question : without a change in leadership , why would the next four years be any different from the last four years ? " the first gen @entity47 were eligible to vote for @entity9 's second term at the height of his popularity and his conservative dogma			2
younger voters for @entity9 , the oldest @entity54 president ever inaugurated , were among his strongest supporters			1
it was not known then that @entity9 's political aura and his mantra for smaller government and lower taxes would endure well into the next century			0
nostalgia for @entity9 is powerful			0
his views remain a litmus test for republicans seeking national office			2
@entity2 and gen @entity16 @entity23 represents more fertile ground for @entity3 in november than younger @entity68 who overwhelmingly supported president @entity19 four years ago			1
in @entity2 , gen x @entity3 see similarities to @entity9 and a changing of the guard			1
" as a fellow gen @entity79 , i 'm excited about him and it says a lot , " said @entity74 , a former @entity77 administration economic policy analyst who has been friends with @entity2 for nearly two decades			1
" there 's a pent up demand that it 's time for us and @entity2 represents the tip of that spear so to speak , " @entity74 said			1
@entity2 formally pitched his personal story and his aggressive budgetary reform agenda in his address that highlighted his connection to post baby boom constituents			2
" i accept the calling of my generation to give our children the @entity54 that was given to us , with opportunity for the young and security for the old -- and i know that we are ready , " @entity2 said in his address			1
@entity98 , anchor of @entity100 's " @entity99 " at the @entity101 , a conservative news site owned by @entity103 , said @entity2 's @entity9 - like sensibilities resonate with voters who came of age in the 1980s			1
" @entity107 was n't the anomaly			0
he was the norm , " @entity98 said , referring to the preppy , politically driven teen sitcom character played by @entity111			0
" @entity9 is not some bogeyman for many gen @entity114			2
" @entity2 's fiscal outlook for streamlining budgets and overhauling the @entity118 healthcare program for the elderly is typical of the thinking of @entity9 - influenced conservative @entity121 , said @entity122 , communications director for the @entity123			2
" this is a guy who grew up in the context of @entity9 's optimism " that included the belief that private enterprise is crucial to addressing national issues , @entity122 said			0
young @entity3 argue that @entity2 's controversial " @entity137 " entitlement reform plan , which proposes a partially privatized @entity118 program , takes a cue from @entity23 and @entity134 concerns that those benefits will not be there for them			1
they also point to high unemployment for younger americans as another factor that could push more younger voters into the arms of @entity143 and @entity2 in november			1
@entity2 tapped into that frustration during his speech			2
" college graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms , staring up at fading @entity19 posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life , " @entity2 said to applause			2
" everyone who feels stuck in the @entity19 economy is right to focus on the here and now			0
and i hope you understand this too , if you 're feeling left out or passed by : you have not failed , your leaders have failed you , " he said			0
young democrats say @entity2 's deeply conservative views diverge from many of his generation and may not appeal to younger voters either			1
" he 's really somebody who has taken positions that are way , way to the right of where most millennial voters are , " said @entity164 , president of the @entity165 and a delegate to next week 's @entity167			0
during the 2008 election , @entity19 won @entity176 voters under the age of 30 by 66 % to 32 % , according to exit polls			0
a recent @entity1 / @entity180 poll of registered voters found @entity19 with a 56 % to 37 % lead among that same demographic			0
the @entity23 vote was closer last time with @entity19 outpacing @entity185 by just 6 points , according to exit polling cited by the @entity188			0
@entity2 's @entity23 sensibilities an asset but on wednesday night it was clear that @entity2 and the @entity3 hope to turn those numbers around			1
" we 're a full generation apart , governor @entity143 and i. and , in some ways , we 're a little different			0
there are the songs on his @entity198 , which i 've heard on the campaign bus and on many hotel elevators , " @entity2 said			2
" he actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies			0
i said , i hope it 's not a deal - breaker @entity205 , but my playlist starts with @entity208 , and ends with @entity209			0
" @entity1 's @entity210 contributed to this report			0

many younger republicans see @entity2 as a symbol of their generation
@entity2 will have to make the case to young voters that @entity16 policies are an asset
young democrats say @entity2 is too far right to represent young voters
