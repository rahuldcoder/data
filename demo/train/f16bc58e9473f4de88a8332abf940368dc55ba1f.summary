-- physical inactivity causes 1 in 10 deaths worldwide , according to a series of studies released in @entity6 medical journal @entity7 , putting it on par with the dangers of smoking and obesity			1
the results also suggest that public health officials treat this situation as a pandemic			1
specifically , @entity18 researchers say , inactivity caused an increase in deaths from coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes , breast and colon cancers and caused more than 5.3 million deaths in 2008 worldwide			2
if physical inactivity rates were to go down by even 10 % to 20 % worldwide , they say , it could save between a half - million and 1.3 million lives each year			1
this could also raise global life expectancy by almost a year			0
@entity32 approves new diet drug " this summer , we will admire the breathtaking feats of athletes competing in the @entity42 , " wrote dr. i - @entity34 , a @entity18 researcher and the lead author of an article accompanying the series of studies			0
" although only the smallest fraction of the population will attain these heights , the overwhelming majority of us are able to be physically active at very modest levels , which bring substantial health benefits			0
" this series of five studies was specifically timed to be released just days before the start of the @entity42 next week , and each of the studies focused on one specific issue related to physical inactivity and its effect on global health			2
adults and children at increased risk the first in the group of five studies suggested that one - third of adults , and close to 80 % of adolescents worldwide , are at increased risk of disease as a result of physical inactivity			2
according to the report , some 1.5 billion adults worldwide face a 20 % to 30 % increased risk of heart disease , diabetes and certain cancers			0
researchers also found that inactivity levels varied widely across the globe , with the lowest levels in @entity79 ( 5 % ) and the highest levels in @entity81 ( 71 % )			0
" in most countries , inactivity rises with age and is higher in women than in men [ 34 % vs 28 % ] , " wrote dr. @entity82 , a professor at the @entity83 in @entity84			1
" @entity90 is also increased in high - income countries			1
" big baby may increase cancer risk for mom why are some people more active ? the second study looked at why certain people and groups of people exercise while others do not			0
the study authors found that previous research focused on individual - level factors such as age , sex and socioeconomic status , and they were conducted primarily in high - income countries			1
but they suggest future research focus on middle and lower - income countries			1
" research has been heavily concentrated in a few developed countries , most of which have stable or falling rates of noncommunicable diseases , rather than in low - income countries where understanding of evidence - based strategies for increasing physical activity is poor , " wrote @entity111 , a researcher from the @entity112 in @entity113			1
" targeting factors known to cause inactivity is key to improving and designing effective interventions to increase activity levels			0
" @entity111 and his colleagues found that health status , being male , young or wealthy tend to make people more physically active , as does family and societal support for physical activity			2
what works to promote physical activity the third article in @entity7 series looked at what specific programs and types of programs work to promote physical activity			2
" because even moderate physical activity such as walking and cycling can have substantial health benefits , understanding strategies that can increase these behaviors in different regions and cultures has become a public health priority , " wrote @entity144 , a researcher from the @entity145 and the lead author of this study			1
too much tv linked with weaker kids @entity144 and his team found that the use of mass - media campaigns to promote exercise , as well as signs to remind people to be active -- taking the stairs , for example -- had some effect on getting people more active			0
the team also found that free , public exercise events , creating an environment that was conducive to exercise ( bike lanes and walking trails ) , and improving public transportation were more likely to improve physical activity			1
" overall , our findings showed the interventions to have consistent and significant effects on physical activity and behaviors , " @entity144 wrote			2
" even though in some instances the effect sizes of these interventions were rather modest , they were large enough to translate into real population - level benefits if rolled out on a larger scale			0
" using mobile phones to get people active the fourth study found that technology , and specifically cell phone technology , could be significant in helping people get fit			0
" with the high prevalence of both physical inactivity and the rapid growth of the mobile phone sector in low - income and middle - income countries , there is a potential for population - level effects that could truly affect global health , " wrote dr. @entity192 , a researcher from the @entity193			1
researchers believe that with more than 4 billion text messaging users worldwide , this could be an effective way to deliver health - conscious messages , particularly in low - income countries			1
according to this report , @entity192 and his team estimated that using internet - based technologies could be twice as effective in middle - income countries as in high - income countries , given that 71 % of the world 's population lives in these countries and many have access to cell phones			1
" this is a big challenge , but marked progress in countries such as @entity222 and @entity84 suggests that it is also an achievable challenge , " he wrote			0
inactivity should be considered a pandemic the final report suggests that physical inactivity should be recognized as a global pandemic and should be treated like any other infectious - disease pandemic would be			2
" the role of physical inactivity continues to be undervalued despite robust evidence of its protective effects , " wrote @entity229 , a researcher at the @entity230 and lead author of this study			0
" the response ... has been incomplete , unfocused and most certainly understaffed			0
... the effect of this tardiness has been to put physical activity in reverse gear compared with population trends and advances in tobacco and alcohol control and diet			0
" @entity229 called on countries -- low , middle and high - income -- to work across disciplines to fix this problem			1
" physical inactivity is an issue that crosses many sectors and will require collaboration , coordination and communication with multiple partners , " he wrote , citing specifically city and community planners , transportation engineers , schools , parks and recreation officials and the media			2
he says that almost 75 % of @entity267 member countries have some sort of plan to improve physical activity , but only 55 % of the plans have been put into effect and only 42 % of the plans in effect are well - funded			1
" substantial improvements in the infrastructure of planning and policy , leadership and advocacy , workforce training and surveillance must be realized , " he said			0

physical inactivity causes 1 in 10 deaths worldwide , series of studies in @entity7 say
researchers suggest public health officials treat inactivity as a pandemic
inactivity often rises with age and is higher in women as well as in high - income countries
studies : exercise events and better public transportation help improve physical activity
