-- in the wake of an online video in which soldiers returning from @entity5 complained that @entity6 charged their unit more than $ 2,800 in bag - check fees , two rival carriers on thursday said they will loosen their checked - bag restrictions for active - duty military members			1
@entity11 announced it will allow military personnel to check an extra two bags with no out - of - pocket expense , and @entity15 said later thursday it will waive baggage charges for " members of the military who are traveling on active duty orders			1
" the airline 's policy is identical to that of @entity24 , which acquired @entity15 in a merger last september , @entity15 spokesman @entity20 told @entity0			0
@entity11 airline will have policy fully implemented " in the next few days , " spokeswoman @entity26 said in a statement released thursday			0
the airlines were the latest of the major @entity32 carriers to change their policies			0
@entity6 and @entity35 / @entity34 announced wednesday they were loosening their checked - bag policies for military personnel			1
previously , @entity11 allowed three bags to be checked free , " with full government reimbursement to military personnel on any bags above that number , " but the carrier decided to increase the free - bag limit to five , " given the potential confusion with different military units carrying different amounts of bags depending on their mission , " according to the statement			1
the statement continued : " both our revised 5 - bag policy as well as the previous policy allowed active military personnel traveling either on orders or on personal travel to utilize our military bag policy			1
in addition , @entity32 also allows military personnel traveling on orders to have one of their free bags weigh up to 100 pounds and ( to be ) 126 linear inches in size without penalty			1
... this greatly helps with the typical , large military duffel bags			0
" its limits on other bags are 50 pounds and 62 linear inches , it said			0
@entity15 's fee waiver also comes with some size and weight restrictions : " as long as each piece of baggage does not exceed 100 pounds in weight and 80 inches in size ( length plus width plus height ) , you will be exempt from baggage charges , and will not be subject to excess , oversized , or overweight baggage charges , " @entity20 said in an e-mail to @entity0 the @entity6 incident got instant notoriety after servicemen spoke out about their experience in a video posted on @entity92			2
in the clip , which the men say was recorded on board a @entity6 flight from @entity98 to @entity99 on tuesday , a day after they returned from @entity5 , the soldiers explain they had " a little issue with the bags			2
" @entity0 affiliate @entity102 in @entity99 identified the soldiers as @entity104			0
the men , who were bound for @entity108 , @entity109 , said their military travel orders allowed them to carry up to four bags , but when they arrived at the airport in @entity98 , @entity6 told them it allowed military personnel to check only three bags for free			1
members of the unit who were traveling with four bags ended up paying out of pocket for their extra luggage , the soldiers said in the video			2
they were charged $ 200 per extra bag , so the 34 - member unit ended up paying more than $ 2,800 in bag fees , the soldiers said			1
any extra bag fees charged by an airline will be reimbursed by the government , a military spokeswoman told @entity0 affiliate @entity131 in @entity99			2
one of the soldiers in the video said the bag he had to pay for was a weapons case that contained " the tools that i used to protect myself and @entity5 citizens while i was deployed in the country			0
" the other man then looked into the camera , exasperated			0
" good business model , @entity6 , " he said sarcastically			0
not happy at all , " he added , shaking his head			0
on wednesday , @entity6 changed its policy : effective immediately , @entity32 military personnel traveling on orders are now allowed to check up to four bags for free in coach and five bags in first class and business class			1
@entity6 spokeswoman @entity152 on thursday said the airline will reimburse the complaining soldiers for any fourth - bag fees that the military will not cover , and is giving them travel vouchers good for future trips			1
@entity34 / @entity35 also announced wednesday it will allow more bags			2
" @entity34 and @entity35 are waiving the fourth checked bag fee for military personnel traveling on orders in recognition of their sacrifice and service to our country , " @entity160 , a spokeswoman for @entity34 / @entity35 , said in an e-mail			1
the two airlines closed a merger deal in october			0
@entity6 said it deeply respects and admires men and women in uniform and added that it has worked hard to ensure that @entity32 military personnel get " additional flexibility " when they travel on the carrier			2
the carrier said it 's " continuing to work with the soldiers individually to make this situation right for each of them			0
" the soldiers may have been misinformed about how many bags traveling active duty military personnel can check for free , according to @entity187 , the independent news organization focusing on the military			1
@entity0 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
