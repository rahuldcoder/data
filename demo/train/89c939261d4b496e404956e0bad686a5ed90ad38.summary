when @entity2 heads to @entity3 this weekend to meet @entity3 prime minister @entity4 , he will be both the first @entity5 president to attend as @entity6 and the first @entity5 president to visit @entity3 twice during his term of office			1
but despite @entity2 's warm rhetoric and talk of @entity5 - @entity3 ties being a " defining partnership of the 21st century , " the man of the hour when i was visiting @entity3 last month was a different world leader : @entity16			1
" @entity17 has been @entity3 's foremost defense partner through decades			1
... @entity17 will remain our foremost defense partner , " @entity4 explained during the @entity17 president 's visit , adding that the " strategic partnership " between the two countries was " incomparable			2
" these comments followed @entity4 's claim to @entity16 at the @entity28 summit last summer that : " even a child in @entity3 , if asked to say who is @entity3 's best friend , will reply it is @entity17 because @entity17 has been with @entity3 in times of crisis			1
" throw in @entity3 's soothing expression of " understanding " over @entity17 's actions in @entity37 , and it is hard not to wonder whether @entity4 's words are more than just the kinds of diplomatic platitudes you might expect from a gracious host			1
indeed , even as @entity4 signed off a speech in @entity46 with the words " may the force be with you , " i was reminded of another classic @entity5 film series -- " @entity51 " -- and wondered whether @entity4 's encouraging words to @entity16 might reflect a certain nostalgia for days gone by			0
true , since the fall of the @entity57 and @entity3 's economic reforms , the world 's two largest democracies have done their best to put the days of @entity60 estrangement behind them : the @entity5 has cooperated with @entity3 extensively on terrorism and maritime security , and @entity3 conducts more military exercises with the @entity5 ( @entity3 's largest defense supplier ) than any other nation			2
in addition , the @entity5 has done the heavy lifting in trying to bring @entity3 into the international civil nuclear community			2
and even @entity3 's traditional concern over the @entity5 - @entity72 relationship seems to have eased in recent years			0
yet as the @entity75 has noted , the @entity3 - @entity17 defense deals announced during @entity16 's visit come at a particularly bad time			1
for the first time since @entity79 , @entity77 has a leader in @entity16 who evidently believes it is acceptable to alter international boundaries through the use of force			0
one would think an @entity3 disputing @entity87 and @entity72 territorial claims to entire @entity3 states would be particularly wary of the embrace of a former @entity91 agent who was so quick to force his own way			0
but even setting aside @entity3 's inconsistency on this , it is unclear what practical benefits @entity3 should see in wanting to so closely ally itself with a country whose currency is being severely devalued , whose economy is reeling from falling oil prices and international sanctions , whose trade with @entity3 is less than a tenth of that with the @entity5 , and whose planes @entity3 has bought , even as questions are now raised about their reliability			0
in fact , the reality is that since the @entity60 , @entity17 has been largely missing in action in regard to @entity3			1
the views of @entity17 expressed during the @entity16 visit therefore seem largely formed by @entity60 relations between @entity3 and the @entity57 rather than present reality			1
but perhaps most importantly of all , this apparent nostalgia raises the question of how @entity3 's policy toward @entity17 can be reconciled with @entity3 values of democracy , the rule of law , and individual liberty -- values shared with the @entity5 and that are often cited by leaders and citizens , including the 3.8 million @entity128 who have helped build the natural partnership between the @entity5 and @entity3			2
because unfortunately , these democratic values are being steadily eroded in @entity17 under @entity16 ( the criminal prosecution of opposition leader @entity133 being but the latest example ) , who has derided talk of them as @entity5 attempts to impose a sort of cultural imperialism			0
both @entity3 and the @entity5 need to work with @entity17 on a variety of issues			2
but this no time for reverting to relations of a bygone era			0
most @entity3 , and a large number of @entity5 , were not even alive when the @entity57 and @entity3 were the best of friends -- an era the @entity5 and @entity3 should be working to put behind them by looking to a future in which @entity5 and @entity3 school children will recognize their respective nations as best friends			0
for this to happen , the @entity5 and @entity3 must act accordingly .			0
