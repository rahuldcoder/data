-- congratulations : if you 're reading this , you have electricity			0
unfortunately , more than 3 million @entity5 this weekend could n't join you			1
the sweltering heat wave that roasted the eastern @entity5 was accompanied by terrible storms that have knocked out power lines up and down the seaboard			1
while you enjoy your air conditioning , you might want to take a minute to consider : why do @entity5 tolerate such outages ? outages are not inevitable			1
the @entity14 power grid has outages at an average rate of 21 minutes per year			1
millions still without power amid record heat wave the winds may howl			1
but in @entity14 , the lights stay on			1
there 's no teutonic engineering magic to this impressive record			2
it 's achieved by a very simple decision : @entity14 buries almost all of its low - voltage and medium - voltage power lines , the lines that serve individual homes and apartments			1
americans could do the same			0
they have chosen not to			0
the choice has been made for reasons of cost			2
the industry rule of thumb is that it costs about 10 times as much to bury wire as to string wire overhead : up to $ 1 million per mile , industry representatives claim			0
since @entity5 cities are much less dense than @entity44 ones , there would be a lot more wire to string to serve a @entity5 population than a @entity44 one			1
but now reflect : 1			0
there 's reason to think that industry estimates of the cost of burying wires are inflated			2
while the @entity5 industry guesstimates costs , a large - scale study of the problem conducted recently in the @entity57 estimated the cost premium at 4.5 to 5.5 times the cost of overhead wire , not 10			1
@entity5 cost figures are a moving target			1
@entity5 cities are becoming denser as the baby boomers age and opt for central - city living , as i discussed in a previous column			2
denser cities require fewer miles of wire to serve their populations			0
costs can only be understood in relation to benefits			0
as the climate warms , storms and power outages are becoming more common			0
and as the population ages , power failures become more dangerous			0
in @entity83 , where air conditioning is uncommon , a 2003 heat wave left 10,000 people dead , almost all of them elderly			0
if burying power lines prevented power outages during the hotter summers ahead , the decision could save many lives			1
photos : extreme heat strikes @entity5 4			2
as you may have heard , we 're suffering very severe unemployment just at present			0
joblessness is acute among less educated workers , many of whom used to work in the now severely depressed construction industry			0
burying power lines is a project that could put many hundreds of thousands of the unemployed to work at tasks that make use of their skills and experience			1
meanwhile , the federal government is able to borrow vast sums of money at the lowest interest rates since the @entity112			0
the @entity114 stimulus has to date failed to produce many projects of lasting benefit to the country			1
but here 's one that our children and grandchildren would appreciate -- and that might save our parents ' lives			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			2

@entity127 : millions on the @entity5 @entity130 lost power in *bad* *weather* this week
he says this happens *regularly* in @entity5 , but not in @entity14 , where power lines are buried
some say it would be too costly to bury power lines ; he says cost creates benefits
@entity143 : stimulus projects have n't done much ; here 's a project that would benefit many , create jobs
