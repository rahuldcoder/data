editor 's note : join @entity2 for his weekly sound - off segment on @entity4 at 11:10 a.m. wednesday			1
if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you			0
a nationally syndicated columnist and @entity9 - based radio host , he is the author of " listening to the @entity10 " and " speak , @entity11 ! a @entity13 's view of @entity14			1
" please visit his web site			0
@entity2 says @entity14 need to rise above issues of race , age and gender when they vote			1
( @entity4 ) -- one of the most intriguing conversations i had at either the @entity23 or @entity24 convention was with a white labor leader from @entity26			0
i ca n't remember his name , but he made it clear that he is going all around the @entity30 state looking his white union brothers and sisters in the eye and essentially shaming them into supporting sen. @entity34 for president			1
no , he 's not saying vote for the black man for president because he 's black			2
he said he 's telling them that it 's shameful that as @entity23 , they agree with him on various political issues , but because of his skin color , they are refusing to cast ballots for him			1
" we have gone to our black brothers and sisters for years to support our [ white ] candidates , and it 's wrong for us to stand here and not support one of their own , even though we 're @entity23 , " he barked			1
there is nothing more in - your - face than to hear someone speak truthfully to the inherent racism that is at play in this election			0
for all the talk about inclusion and the historic nature of this campaign , the true tribal feelings of so many people will come into play , whether we want to admit it or not			1
we are seeing remarkable bias playing strongly in this election			0
exit - polling data in the primaries showed some evidence of bias when it came to age , race and gender , but the great concern is whether people are as honest in talking to pollsters as they are in the voting booth			1
because sen. @entity82 is 72 and would be the oldest person to be sworn in as president , there is a lot of dialogue about how old this white guy is , and how wrong it is that he 's running			1
age questions also have been raised about the 47 - year - old black guy from @entity9 and whether he is too young and inexperienced to lead			2
while there is a lot of talk and excitement surrounding @entity98 gov. @entity97 being named as the first woman on a @entity24 ticket , and what that may mean in terms of widespread female support coming the way of @entity106 , there are some voices who refuse to vote for a woman			1
we 've also seen a number of prominent women -- including @entity113 columnist @entity112 and radio talk show host dr. @entity114 -- who have questioned whether the 44 - year - old white mother of five children should be vice president , considering she has five children , including a special needs child			2
it 's wonderful to talk about the economy , immigration , the war in @entity125 , health care and education , but we ca n't be na√Øve to the reality that when voters go into that voting booth , they will , as one person told me during an interview , " vote with their tribe			2
" that was one of the arguments we heard during the @entity23 primaries when @entity34 enjoyed overwhelming support from african - americans -- to the tune of 90 - plus percent -- while sen. @entity143 had major female support , largely white , in the range of 65 to 70 percent			1
so what do we do when it comes to our tendency to follow group identification ? 1			0
stop dancing around the topic			1
when you watch tv and hear folks talk about @entity156 moms or small , rural towns , they are talking about white @entity14			1
these catch phrases never include african - americans or @entity160 2			0
confront bias where it is			0
ask your friends , neighbors , co-workers and church members who they are voting for			0
when they give you the " i really ca n't put my finger on it " line , then press them			0
you know the real answer , so do n't beat around the bush			0
the best folks to challenge @entity14 on their hang - ups regarding age , race and gender are n't the @entity179 , @entity180 or now			1
it 's @entity182 do n't give in to the " that 's the way i was raised " mantra			2
when someone suggests that flags and faith show that a candidate is n't one of us , drill down			0
accept the fact that some people will not change			2
we all think that we have been gifted to the degree that our sane and logical arguments can get folks off their biased stumps			0
some people just wo n't give in			2
the goal is to rid our society of as much bias as possible			0
if someone is so hard - headed , then you have to go on to the next person and try to change them			0
it 's critical that we be as honest as possible about the impact of race , age and gender in campaigns			1
a lot of people love to toss around the rev. @entity216 's quote that he hoped one day people would be judged by " the content of their character			2
" but it 's still a reality that skin tone , gender and our birth date means more than character to a lot of @entity14			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
