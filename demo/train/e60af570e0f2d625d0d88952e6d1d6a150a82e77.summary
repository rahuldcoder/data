@entity7 , the posh @entity8 mansion that doubles as @entity4 in the long - running @entity8 television series , is opening up rooms to paying guests			1

the rooms are split across the two buildings flanking the original gateway built in 1793			0
majestic @entity30 castle on one side there 's a kitchen and sitting room arranged around a wood - burning stove			1
on the other there 's a double bedroom , bathroom and dressing area			0
there are no servants quarters , so guests should n't expect white - gloved flunkeys delivering their morning newspaper			2
and , since it 's unlikely to available during filming , there 's little chance of being witheringly insulted by the acid - tongued @entity49 of @entity51			2
what is on offer is a chance to gaze enviously at one of @entity8 's most majestic @entity30 castles and the surrounding 6,000 acres of parkland			1
situated to the north of the castle , the lodge will be available for @entity61 2015 and for selected weekends through the spring and summer			0
