@entity0 -- president @entity2 wants @entity3 to take steps to rebuild the trust shattered by @entity7 's actions in @entity8			1
@entity2 's comment came as he visited @entity10 on tuesday , the first stop on his three - country @entity13 trip which is intended , in part , to reassure allies in @entity17 unnerved by @entity7 's annexation of @entity8 's @entity19			1
@entity3 " has a choice to make " on @entity8 , @entity2 said during a news conference in @entity0 , calling on the @entity7 president to continue to pull back troops from the border with @entity8 , persuade @entity25 separatists to stand down and back @entity8 's recent presidential election			1
if the @entity28 sees " responsible behavior " from @entity7 , @entity2 said , " i think it is possible for us to try to rebuild some of the trust that has been shattered			1
" but he warned that it will take " quite some time			0
" @entity34 and the @entity35 have said the separatists in @entity8 are coordinated and supplied by @entity7 , a claim that @entity38 denies			2
@entity2 's visit comes a day after a deadly attack on a regional headquarters building in @entity42 that has been taken over by separatists calling themselves the @entity45 of @entity46			1
five women and three men , all of them civilians , were killed in the attack , which @entity34 has blamed on separatists			0
a munitions expert who accompanied a @entity1 crew to the scene , however , said the damage to the building was indicative of an airstrike			1
social media video shows an aircraft overhead after the attacks , trees are splintered as if they were hit from above and craters in a nearby square leading to the building appear to have been the result of heavy cannon fire from the air			0
a meeting in @entity70 ? @entity2 , speaking alongside @entity10 president @entity71 , said he had always had a " business - like relationship " with @entity3 and that he had conveyed the same messages to him in private conversations as were made in public			1
he said @entity76 wanted good relations , but added that sanctions imposed over @entity7 's @entity19 excursion would be maintained and that more have been drawn up in case of further destabilization in the east			1
@entity2 added that he was " sure " he would cross paths with @entity3 while both are in @entity70 at the end of the week for events to mark the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings			1
@entity2 said he was looking forward to meeting with @entity8 's president - elect @entity89 on wednesday , adding that his election last month " gives us some momentum to build on as we move forward			1
" he also stressed the need for @entity8 to pursue economic as well as political reform , including taking steps to reduce its reliance on natural gas from @entity7			2
at the same news conference , @entity2 announced that he is asking @entity100 for a fund of up to $ 1 billion to allow for a " @entity102 " to bolster the security of @entity105 allies			2
this would help the @entity28 undertake increased training exercises , explore the pre-positioning of military equipment , and build the capacity of @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity8 to partner with the @entity28 and @entity105			0
more @entity28 @entity115 and @entity116 personnel will be rotated through allied countries in central and eastern @entity17 , @entity2 said			2
he urged all @entity105 nations to live up to their commitment to the alliance when member states are threatened , and commended @entity10 for its contribution			0
@entity125 questions as he undertakes his third overseas trip in less than three months , @entity2 finds himself once again peppered with questions about his foreign policy , even as he attempts to cement his own legacy on the world stage			1
his latest trip comes as @entity132 have unleashed a new line of attack questioning his judgment in exchanging five @entity137 prisoners held at the detention center at @entity139 , @entity140 , for the return of a former prisoner of war , @entity116 sgt. @entity125			1
@entity2 defended the decision , saying , " we do n't leave men and women in uniform behind			0
" his administration had previously consulted with @entity100 on the possibility of a prisoner exchange for @entity125 , @entity2 said , but said it had to move quickly because of concerns over @entity125 's health and to not miss a window of opportunity			1
he said he was confident the exchange of @entity137 prisoners for @entity125 would not endanger @entity28 national security because the @entity158 , who helped broker the deal , would be keeping a close eye on the @entity163 detainees			0
@entity164 : superpower not ' up to the job ' for @entity2 , the itinerary of foreign travel has changed , but the conversation will sound familiar			0
during his last two foreign trips , he fielded questions about his approach to the crises in @entity8 and @entity173 , as well as the territorial disputes in @entity175 between @entity176 and its neighbors			0
in @entity178 , @entity2 responded that his second - term strategy is to avoid " errors			0
" but away from the cameras , he has simplified his doctrine as " do n't do stupid stuff , " administration officials say privately			0
however , @entity2 's critics , both at home and abroad , contend that approach is at best uninspiring , and potentially dangerous			2
@entity164 , the former @entity10 president whose democratic solidarity movement helped usher in freedom in @entity10 during the fall of the @entity191 , has warned that @entity28 influence has declined under @entity2 's watch			1
" the superpower has not been up to the job , " @entity164 said in a recent interview with the @entity196 television network			0
" therefore , the world is at a dangerous point and maybe it really is the case that lots of bad things are happening in the world because there is no leadership , " added @entity164 , who endorsed @entity2 's rival , @entity200 , in the 2012 presidential election			2
@entity2 has billed his recent decisions against any form of military action in @entity173 and @entity8 as successes because they rallied multilateral responses to global challenges , without messy prolonged commitments for @entity28 armed forces			0
@entity2 , @entity3 cross paths in @entity70 , @entity2 will have several opportunities to cross paths with @entity3			1
they are both scheduled to dine with @entity70 president @entity223 on thursday in @entity224 , though in separate meetings			0
the @entity228 government 's press office confirmed tuesday that @entity228 chancellor @entity229 will speak with @entity3 on friday in @entity230 , when the two will discuss the situation in @entity8			2
the talks on the sidelines of the @entity237 commemorations will continue a telephone conversation the two leaders held tuesday and focus on measures to aid the stabilization of @entity8 , it said			0
@entity2 led the international effort to suspend @entity7 's participation in the world group of economic powers			1
that suspension resulted in the relocation of this year 's @entity249 summit from @entity250 , @entity7 , to @entity251 , which will occur during @entity2 's trip			1
recent moves by @entity7 to withdraw some of its forces from its border with @entity8 has the potential to ease tensions between @entity38 and @entity76			0
but administration officials caution a new detente is a long way off			0
@entity1 's @entity261 wrote and reported from @entity0 , @entity262 from @entity263 and @entity264 from @entity42			2
@entity1 's @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 and @entity268 contributed to this report .			0
