@entity0 , @entity1 -- at some point , the " rush to rehab , " reached the ridiculous			1
does a week pass without some celebrity , politician or famous athlete heading to a rehabilitation treatment center ? and often with the cameras rolling			2
rehab is getting a bad name from this , and i worry that this will rub off on our perceptions of the average alcoholic or drug addict who works hard to stay clean and sober , takes responsibility for his or her actions -- and knows that there is still work to do after the first 30 days			1
doubt it ? then how to explain the cynical jokes on late - night tv , the tearful confessions from the talk - show couch , or this : " @entity27 with dr. @entity28 , " a @entity30 reality show that features famous or almost famous people in treatment for addiction or behavioral issues			1
the cases of @entity38 ( in and out of rehab ; now off to jail ) and @entity41 ( reportedly in therapy after the release of the alleged tirade tapes ) are just the most recent examples of a high - profile practice in vogue since the 1980s , when @entity48 opened her famous center in @entity50 , @entity1			1
of course , there are famous people who benefit greatly from a stay in treatment , who do it privately and with sincere purpose			2
but it 's common , too common , to see the well - known on tv , after completing a 30 - or 45 - day program , proclaim themselves " saved , " only to show up on @entity63 the next week partying or running people over with their cars			1
this " rehab - abuse " ( used maybe to wait out a public relations storm after bad behavior , or draw attention to a stalled career ? ) devalues and trivializes the very real , very unglamorous struggle of pulling free of addiction and making amends for harmful behavior			1
more than others , the famous have a responsibility to treat the process with respect			0
as a former drug and alcohol abuser ( clean and sober for more than 26 years ) , i know something about the work that goes into transforming a life			2
one of the first things i learned in @entity87 and @entity88 was that alcoholism and drug addiction are not excuses for injuring yourself or others			2
part of recovery is making a list of people you 've harmed , making amends to them personally and accepting the consequences of your past actions			0
i did n't make an announcement to the world and i still do n't think i have all the answers , but i came out of it knowing a lot more			0
i also learned that i need to have a connection to something greater than myself , which to me is a higher power that i call @entity109			0
like other recovering substance abusers , i know i 'm not the center of the world and life does n't start and end with me			0
i 've found that people who stay clean and sober the longest have some kind of spiritual belief , whether it 's @entity109 , life force , universal energy or a sense of oneness with the world			2
they also realize that amends and apologies have to mean something and indicate a change in actions and thought processes			0
" apologies by proxy " -- when celebrities ( or noncelebrities , for that matter ) make inappropriate , racist remarks , then apologize to well - known people from the group targeted by the comment -- just do n't cut it			1
entering treatment for addiction means you get treatment for your addiction			1
any other changes you make are up to you			0
that also means that a racist alcoholic who gets treated for alcoholism can still be a sober racist , @entity150 , homophobe or engage in inappropriate behavior			0
someone who spews hateful prejudices can stay in rehab forever , but unless he has some education , time for self - examination and the willingness to get to see people from diverse backgrounds as human beings and understand their lives and experiences , he 'll be the same			1
the media could stem this perverse fascination by remembering the young people ( and older people , too ) struggling with substance abuse who see " role models " regress on national tv and feel hopeless for their own chance for recovery			1
what else can they think but , " what 's the use ? if they ca n't stay clean with so many people helping , how can i ? " in the last 26 years , i 've experienced the death of my parents , the death of my partner of 18 years and a new life as a single parent			2
i was hospitalized and came close to death			0
i was run over and could n't work for a year			2
i did n't use drugs or alcohol as a way to deal with these experiences			0
let 's stop glamorizing these celebrity addicts and adding to their out - of - control drama			1
let 's get real about their addictions and the impact on their families			0
let 's discuss solutions , and all the options for help			0
let 's sensationalize being clean and sober			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity209 says it 's routine to see celebrities very publicly checking into rehab
this trivializes the hard work of rehab , she says , makes it *fodder* for late - night gags and reality tv
when celebs lapse , seem not to take treatment seriously , she says , it sends harmful message
@entity209 : let 's stop feeding fascination ; get serious about addiction 's costs , responsibilities
