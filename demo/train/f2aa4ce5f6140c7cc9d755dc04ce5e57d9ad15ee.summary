@entity1 , 69 , walked out of the minimum - security @entity7 at 11 a.m. the facility is located at the intersection of @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity1 had been in a full - time work - release program since march 1992 that allowed him to live at home with his family in @entity17 five days a week while reporting to the prison just two days			1

" i do n't think it should ever have happened			0
" @entity1 had been sentenced to 20 years to life imprisonment after being found guilty at trial with two others in 1966			2
the other two men were released in the 1980s and have long denied involvement in the killing			0
to win his release , @entity1 was required to seek , obtain and maintain a job , support his children and abide by a curfew			1
he must continue to meet those conditions while free			0

he told the @entity53 in 2008 he was working at a fast - food restaurant			2
a parole officer checked on him while outside prison , and he had to undergo random drug tests			0
@entity0 was unable to reach @entity1 for a comment about his release			1
the @entity59 declined comment for this story			2
@entity4 is best known as the fiery leader of the @entity59 who denounced whites as " blue - eyed devils			1
" but at the end of his life , @entity4 changed his views toward whites and discarded the @entity59 's ideology in favor of orthodox @entity59			1
in doing so , he feared for his own life from within the @entity72			0
@entity4 remains a symbol of inspiration for black men , in particular , who are moved by his transformation from a street hustler to a man the late @entity81 - @entity80 actor @entity79 eulogized as " our own black shining prince			1
" the ballroom where he was killed has now been converted into the @entity4 & dr. @entity84 and @entity85			1
board chairman @entity86 said the center does n't have a position on @entity1 's release			1
" i personally find it strange that for a couple decades any person convicted in the assassination of such an iconic figure would be allowed such leniency , " @entity86 said			0
there 's outrage among some african - americans , he said , that he 's being released			2
would he be set free if he had killed an iconic white leader ? " it 's really a struggle for @entity101 to contemplate this issue , because our faith and our religion is full of examples where we have to exert mercy , " he added			1
" the @entity4 story has not ended			2
his populuarity has grown in death			0
... only @entity111 knows why this was allowed to happen			0
" the center is preparing for a special service next month to celebrate what would have been @entity4 's 85th birthday			1
would the center welcome @entity1 if he asked to attend ? " we 'd cross that bridge if he called us , " @entity86 said , " think about that : how far - fetched is it that he could meet one of the daughters of @entity4 ? and what 's going to happen then ? mercy , fury , anger , emotions -- who knows ? " killed in front of his family on february 21 , 1965 , @entity4 took to the stage of the @entity32 , a site often used for civic meetings			1

" minister @entity4 was slaughtered like a dog in front of his family , " @entity156 @entity155 , one of @entity4 's closest aides , told the @entity158 on the 40th anniversary of the killing			1
the assassination came after a public feud between @entity4 and the @entity59 's founder , @entity167			1
@entity4 had accused @entity167 of infidelity and left the @entity72 in march 1964			2
" for the next 11 months , there was a pattern of harassment , vilification and even on occasion literally pursuit in the streets of @entity4 by people associated with the @entity72 , " said @entity169 , author of a biography on @entity167 called an original man			1
" @entity4 felt that if @entity167 snapped his fingers , then he could stop the escalation of the violent tone around the split of the two men			1
and i think there 's some truth to that			0
" over the years , the killing of @entity4 has been the subject of much debate , with conspiracy theories involving the @entity59 and others			1
the @entity59 has repeatedly denied any involvement in @entity4 's assassination			1
on a deadly mission @entity1 , then known by the name @entity198 , was in his early 20s and a radical member of the @entity59 the day he entered the ballroom armed and ready to kill			1
his allegiance was to the @entity72 's founder , and he was outraged @entity4 had broken from its ranks			2
after the shooting , @entity1 tried to flee the scene but he was shot in the leg			2
he was beaten by the crowd before being arrested outside			0
last month , he told the parole board he felt the urge to kill @entity4 because of his inflammatory comments about the @entity72 's founder			1
" it stemmed from a break off and confusion in the leadership , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity4 broke with the @entity59 , separated from the @entity59 , and in doing so there was controversy as to some of the statements he was making about the leader			1
" he added , " history has revealed a lot of what @entity4 was saying was true			2
" two other men , @entity224 and @entity225 , were also found guilty of murder in 1966 and received 20 years to life			0
@entity1 , who eventually admitted his part in the murder , testified at trial and subsequent parole hearings that both men were innocent			2
@entity224 was paroled in 1985 ; @entity59 was freed in 1987			2
at last month 's parole hearing , @entity1 again maintained that @entity224 and @entity59 were not the other assassins			1
he said it was two other men who helped plot , plan and participate in the killing			0
did they receive orders from the @entity72 to carry out the killing ? " i ca n't say that anyone in the @entity59 gave us the idea or instructed us to do it			0
we did this ourselves for the most part , yes , " @entity1 told the parole board			1
@entity1 said he received a master 's degree in sociology while incarcerated and that helped him deal with his actions from 45 years ago			2
" i understand a lot better the dynamics of movements and what can happen inside movements and conflicts that can come up , but i have deep regrets about my participation in that			0
" he added , " unfortunately , i did n't have an in - depth understanding of what was really going on myself to let myself be involved in anything like that			0
... i ca n't really describe my remiss and my remorse for my actions -- basically a very young man , a very uneducated man			0
" he is still a muslim but no longer a member of the @entity59			0
he volunteers at a mosque to help young men			0
he told the parole board he hopes to become a qualified substance abuse counselor			1
his primary mission is to help his four children , ages 21 , 17 , 14 and 10			0
he has two other grown children			0
" my focus is to maintain my family and to try to make things a little better for them			0
it 's upward mobility , and to encourage my children to complete their education because it 's a must			0
