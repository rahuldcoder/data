-- i got a rather weird invitation last week			0
i am a @entity3 strategist who often takes to the @entity0 airwaves to criticize president @entity6			1
when the rather official - looking e-mail arrived inviting me to share my thoughts with the president , well , let 's just say it made me highly suspicious i was getting punked			0
but it was n't a joke			0
apparently , president @entity6 's charm offensive extends beyond @entity3 in @entity15 to occasionally critical @entity3 pundits			1
last monday , i joined a small group of @entity20 @entity19 leaders in meeting with president @entity6 , ahead of his trip to @entity22 and @entity23 this week			1
before the meeting , several friends asked me : " why is @entity6 going to @entity26 ? " it 's a legitimate question			2
it 's not often that @entity20 presidents travel to @entity26 without the specific purpose of participating in a summit or visiting an area ravaged by a natural disaster			2
but it seems that president @entity6 's only reason for going is to pay the region some attention , recognize the role of these countries as strategic partners of the @entity20 and service the relationship			1
every now and then , it 's wise to drop in on neighbors for a friendly visit -- just because			0
for decades , @entity26 has been on the back burner and only became of interest when war or another crisis erupted			2
my friends there frequently tell me they feel neglected by " @entity52 o @entity53			0
" president @entity6 laid out a thoughtful and broad approach to the bilateral relationship with @entity22 and @entity56			1
too often when we think of this region , we think only of problems			0
there are plenty of those : violence , gangs , drug trafficking , border security , corruption , political instability			0
but plenty of positive things can be highlighted , and it seems that is what president @entity6 wants to do			1
the trip is intended to cast a light on economic opportunities and joint interests in commerce between the @entity20 and @entity26 , and competing globally as a united block			1
he plans to give a forward - looking speech in @entity22 , focusing on how the economies of the two countries are intertwined and how together , they can better compete in the international economy			2
a marker of success for this trip would be to convince @entity22 that the @entity20 considers it a full strategic partner			1
in @entity56 , the president intends to recommit to fostering improved trade with the countries of the isthmus			0
we have @entity93 , the @entity93 , which the administration would like to see working better			0
other issues , such as immigration , will always creep into a conversation about @entity26 and @entity20 ties			1
the @entity22 and @entity56 do n't like it when we @entity100 preach to them about their internal politics , and we would n't like it much more if they did the same to us			0
@entity22 is not the place to go debate or advance @entity20 immigration legislation			2
but it would make sense to promote the economic benefits of a modernized and streamlined immigration system that would allow the regulated flow of tourists and workers from @entity26			1
it 's a good thing that president @entity6 is making this trip			1
afterward , the key question becomes what the tangible followup will be			0
in order to develop healthy and productive ties with the region , the engagement has to be long - term and sustained			0
our cabinet secretaries and other high - level administration officials should also be deployed on a mission of strengthening relationships			0
i suggested to president @entity6 that he find a way to send @entity20 hispanic civic leaders and professionals as good will ambassadors			1
also , president @entity6 should issue a statement on the violence and political strife going on in @entity137 since last month 's election			2
the words of a @entity20 president carry great weight			2
it is important for @entity137 to know that the international community is concerned about what is happening in their country			0
as we left the meeting , i wished president @entity6 good luck on his trip and left him with one parting thought : " keep a close eye on the @entity152 this time ... " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			1
