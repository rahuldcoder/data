-- a member of the @entity3 punk band @entity2 -- convicted last summer after a protest performance inside a @entity6 cathedral -- had her parole bid rejected friday when a judge said she 'd broken prison rules and never expressed regret , state news reported			1
@entity13 's lawyer argued that she should be freed because she has a small child , had n't had conflicts with other inmates and would have a job once she was freed , reported @entity18 , an official news agency focused on legal matters			1
but the judge in @entity22 , in central @entity3 , sided with prosecutors and took into account @entity13 's behavior at a penal colony in @entity27 , about 1,000 kilometers ( 700 miles ) east of @entity6			1
" she had not always observed the rules of conduct , " the judge ruled according to another state news agency , @entity28			1
" she has two disciplinary penalties not yet removed from her record			0
" @entity34 , @entity13 's lawyer , told state news that her client will appeal friday 's ruling			1
@entity13 and another band member , @entity38 , both in their 20s , were sentenced in august for performing a song critical of president @entity42 in one of the @entity45 's most important cathedrals			2
@entity46 , a third member of the band , was sentenced at the same time			0
but she was freed from prison last october			0
footage of the brief but provocative protest action in february 2012 attracted worldwide attention after it was posted online			0
it showed the band members , their faces shrouded by balaclavas , screaming " @entity59 , please drive @entity42 away " inside @entity60 , outraging many of the @entity3 church 's faithful the three women , who were arrested shortly after the act , were all convicted of hooliganism			1
two other members of the all - female group have fled @entity3			2
human rights activists and celebrities alike rallied around @entity2 -- and railed at @entity3 authorities for going after women who , they said , were expressing their political views -- following the band members ' arrest			1
@entity75 and @entity76 , for example , both issued reports earlier this year sharply criticizing @entity3 's record on freedom of expression			1
the heavy clampdown on government critics and activists , the groups said , has increased since @entity42 returned to the presidency -- which happened a few months after the @entity2 protest act			2
@entity42 subsequently denied his government employs " stalinist elements " -- which he equated to a " personality cult and mass violation of law , reprisals , prison camps			0
" " but that does n't mean we should have no discipline , no law and order -- and all people in @entity3 should be equal before the law			2
" that includes the women in @entity2 , @entity42 said			2

they get punished for violating the law			0
everybody should observe the law			0
