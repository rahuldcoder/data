@entity1 , @entity0 -- a landscape restoration of a rubbish dump has won the @entity6 category at the 2008 @entity7 in @entity8 , @entity9			1
@entity9 architects @entity10 and @entity12 have returned a 150 hectare rubbish dump back to nature			1
" @entity16 " ( @entity17 of @entity18 ) project , designed by @entity9 architects @entity10 and @entity12 , has transformed a 150 hectare site in the @entity20 , south - west of @entity8 into a green terraced agricultural landscape			1
in awarding the prize , judges @entity23 -- @entity26 + @entity25 architects -- and @entity27 -- editor - in - chief of @entity29 -- described the scheme as : " a perfect example of bringing dead nature back to life by converting rubbish into a beautiful piece of landscape architecture ... using few and humble means "			1
@entity12 of @entity38 and @entity39 told @entity2 : " the idea was to create a system of hills and banks in a way that would avoid erosion from water and to give the rubbish dump back to nature with a natural design			1
" work to transform the site -- the largest landfill in @entity9 -- began in 2000 and was completed earlier this year			1
it is a striking redrawing of a previously scarred and polluted landscape			1
the landfill has been servicing @entity8 's metropolitan area for over 30 years			1
more than 20 million tons of rubbish was spread around the valley before the site was closed in 2006			1
in some places , you would have to dig down over 100 meters before you found soil again			0
but this is n't just a cosmetic makeover			0
there is an underground drainage system on site which filters contaminated waste fluids			1
part of this recycled water is then used to irrigate the park			1
" the whole project is very sustainable , " @entity12 said			2
furthermore , the dump is also utilizing the bio gas that is emitted to provide electricity			1
some of the rubbish has remained above ground			2
housed in large steel cages which flank the entrance to the site , @entity12 says they serve as a permanent reminder to visitors of the site 's previous life			2
judge , @entity27 told @entity2 : " it 's a very beautiful and simple design			0
it is landscape architecture that is inspiring			2
it is a very good example that everyone could look at and say : ' we could do the same			0
' this competition is about pointing out good examples that could inspire architects			2
" @entity10 and @entity12 's winning design was one of eight short - listed projects in the @entity6 category , which was notable for the variety of entries			2
they range from @entity109 , hi - tech plans such as the @entity104 designed by @entity105 and @entity106 , right down to low - cost , primitive ventures like the @entity100 devised by @entity102 company , @entity101			0
the communal cooker is turning rubbish into fuel to feed residents of one of @entity116 's biggest slums -- @entity117 -- on the outskirts of @entity119 , @entity102			2
the project was highly commended by the judges			0
" sustainability is a very important issue and so are the questions about rubbish , especially in @entity127 countries , " @entity27 said			0
" the community cooker is a way of introducing a solution directly into the society			0
" @entity27 , himself a trained architect , believes that @entity6 is the most important category at the inaugural @entity7			1
" we are facing big problems , so it is a great opportunity for architects to work seriously with this problem on many different levels			0
" i think flashy executive buildings are interesting in one sense but they are not interesting if they are not dealing seriously with this matter			0
in my opinion you can throw them out			0
we have to be far more serious about integrating aspects of sustainability into architecture			0
" both @entity23 and @entity27 noted that engineering and architecture had to combine to deal with issues concerning waste and recycling			0
they said that achieving sustainability was a difficult task but it also represented a great opportunity for architects to contribute to the sphere .			0
