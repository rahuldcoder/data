-- a @entity2 store that sold a gun used to kill 26 people last december at @entity5 no longer can legally sell firearms			1
@entity7 , a spokeswoman for the federal @entity8 , told @entity0 on friday the @entity10 shop in @entity11 , @entity2 , lost its federal firearms license december 20 -- six days after the massacre about 65 miles southwest in @entity5			1
that day , after killing his mother in their @entity5 home , @entity14 drove to the elementary school and shot dead 20 young children and six adults using a semiautomatic bushmaster .223 - caliber model @entity22 rifle			1
the shooter 's mother , @entity5 , bought the @entity24 firearm two years ago at @entity28 , according to detective @entity29 of the @entity30			1
the @entity8 spokeswoman did not comment on why the store 's license was revoked , including if it had anything to do with the @entity5 rampage			1
but @entity29 said " probably the reason the @entity8 raided the store on december 20 was for poor keeping of the records			1
" according to police , on december 15 -- a day after the @entity5 shooting -- a man was arrested at @entity10 for stealing a .50 - caliber firearm			1
upon investigation , authorities learned the man allegedly stole a @entity49 firearm from the same shop four days earlier ; in fact , he 'd been arrested in june 2011 for allegedly stealing nine firearms from the store			2
@entity5 shooting details revealed in newly released documents afterward , authorities told @entity10 ' owner @entity57 of the december arrest and checked surveillance images			1
@entity60 was not aware multiple thefts had taken place			0
" the owner is nonchalant			0
he is a very non-caring gun owner , very lax in his paperwork , " said @entity29 , the @entity11 detective			0
" he was eventually closed for hundreds and hundreds of federal and state law violations			0
" @entity57 , the store 's owner , could not be reached for comment on friday			0
his store has reopened but no longer sells guns , the detective said , though shoppers can still buy survival equipment and other items there			2
the @entity8 conducted more than 11,400 firearms compliance inspections in 2012			0
the federal agency sought to revoke licenses in about 100 cases that year , which works out to less than 1 % of all places inspected			0
according to the @entity8 website , violations commonly cited in license revocation include " failure to account for firearms , failure to verify and document purchaser eligibility , failure to maintain records requisite for successful firearms tracing , and failure to report multiple sales of handguns			0
" this past week , @entity2 passed what advocacy groups call the strongest gun - control legislation of any state in the country			2
the law bans the sale or purchase of high - capacity magazines , like the ones used in the @entity5 shooting , and requires background checks for all gun purchases .			2
