the drive from @entity1 to @entity2 in @entity3 was long and dark			1
the winter sun had yet to rise and we saw little of the outside world from our misty car windows			0
but as we arrived at @entity9 , @entity3 's border with @entity10 , a picture began to form of the economic strength of this region			1
in front of us , swaths of land were being bitten into and scooped up by colossal @entity17 diggers			0
that 's because underneath this grey - brown land is a soft - brown sedimentary rock that is rich in oil			1
but unlike shale oil and shale gas which is drilled and often associated with fracking , oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground			1

it will then be burned to create electric power or processed even further to produce liquid fuel			2
they have so much of the stuff here -- 18 million tonnes are mined here every year -- that they are completely energy independent			1
@entity44 's ceo , @entity43 , tells me that around 90 % of the power produced in @entity3 is made of oil shale and they even have enough to provide for their neighbors			1

@entity3 consumes less than eight terrawats , so we are a very strong electricity exporter today			1
" but this is not a new industry for @entity3			1

" commercial utilization of oil shale started nearly 100 years ago			1
@entity3 got our independence in 1918 and actually @entity3 independence is very much close links with the oil shale industry , because in 1924 we already had oil plants in operation , and even gasoline was produced , " he said			1
" as you can see from here , during last three years , we have invested one billion euros here			0
so this is not only 100 years of history but this is actually modernization and continuous development of technology and new investments			0
" read more : @entity90 's booming @entity89 economy during our visit here , one of their proudest achievements -- the @entity95 oil shale plant , which will double output of kerogen oil -- was already taking shape			1
but talk of new plants , more open - cast pits and more shifting of land makes environmentalist cringe			2
@entity106 is one of those calling for @entity3 to ditch this primitive way of mining , arguing that there are enough renewable resources in the country to have 100 % power supply based on renewables			1

now , he 's the director of climate and @entity119 at @entity121 's @entity120			2
" oil shale is the dirtiest fuel used today in @entity124			1
the external cost of the oil shale power is 18 euro cents , coal is about is 10 cents per kw hour , wind is 0.4 euro cents -- that gives you a picture of the ecological footprint of the oil shale used , " he told me			1
watch more : a history of defaulting on debt " oil shale industry contributes approximately 4 % of @entity3 's gdp , but , at the same time , total national emissions it provides 90 % of the hazardous waste , about 80 % of the major air emissions and 70/80 % of the water used			1
so , it has a really huge impact to the environment			0
" it 's a charge that i put to @entity44 's ceo who counter-argued by telling me that for the land they shift is replanted with trees			2
one thing is very clear , the environmental impact is very predictable			0
off course , we mine , we have some mining impact -- we move the land , but we put it back and we plant a lot of trees			0
i think in [ the ] energy business anyway , and in any industry , [ there is ] an environmental impact , even in the wind turbine has an environmental impact			2
" he continued : " yes , they do n't emit @entity170 in the place where you produce electricity but you know a lot of environmental impact has been done getting metals , transporting it and building it			0
i think it 's very important in the oil shale case that you know what you get , you know that this environmental impact is very predictable			1
" read more : bumpy road ahead for @entity185 cabbie business the problem is @entity3 wo n't want to let go of its oil shale dependence , because it 's competitive			1
it 's cheaper than @entity10 gas , onshore and offshore wind			2
on top of that , it would cost companies too much to change their @entity17 infrastructure			0
and then there is political pressure , @entity106 told me			0
" there is biomass , there is a nice wind condition , we are a coastal country , by the @entity208 sea so there is a lot of wind			0
but mainly the question is we have inherited these power production systems , these power plants ; it 's much more costly to replace			2
" @entity106 pointed to political pressure , too			0
" elections are every four years , and the voters will ask what will happen with their electricity or their energy costs			0
politicians always try to answer that " we keep the power prices down			0
" therefore , the system stays without major changes			0
" but these advantages may not last			0
@entity3 's oil shale gamble assumes that oil prices will remain high , and that the price they pay the @entity124 for carbon emissions remains low			1
this may be the case ( carbon is hovering around four euros a tonne )			0
but some in the @entity29 parliament are calling for prices to be pushed back up as much as fifty euros a tonne , a price that could be damaging for a business like this one which has built itself mostly on shale			0
while @entity43 may be worried about oil prices and emission costs , he tells me it 's not enough to make him lose sleep			2
so , for the time being , @entity44 is powering on			0
its international arm @entity95 is betting on shale selling beyond its borders , with a plant in @entity255 and recently bought land in the @entity258 state of @entity259			0
but if shale does stay strong , @entity3 could win big .			1

@entity3 is using oil shale to generate energy . oil shale is found in rocks just 30 metres underground
oil shale industry contributes approximately 4 % of @entity3 's gdp . 90 % of the power produced in @entity3 is made of oil shale .
18 million tonnes are mined of oil shale every year - that in @entity2 in @entity3 .
