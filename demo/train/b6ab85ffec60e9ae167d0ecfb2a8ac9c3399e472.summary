-- may 3 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 & @entity7 @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity15 , mayor , @entity5 : let me say that we are very lucky			1
thanks to alert @entity5 and professional police officers , we avoided what could have been a very deadly event			1
@entity23 , @entity24 : that story out of @entity5 leading off our show today			1
first up : @entity4 @entity29 : things are more or less back to normal in @entity5 's @entity4			1
the area was put on lockdown for a while over the weekend , and here is why : saturday night , someone left an suv with the engine running on the street			1
a t - shirt vendor noticed it , saw smoke coming out of it , told a nearby police officer			1
the officer looked inside and spotted what authorities think might have been a bomb			1
that 's what triggered the lockdown			1
@entity4 is usually filled with tourists and people going to the theater			1
authorities immediately evacuated the area			2
you can see some of that in this @entity58			2
some people were moved out of @entity4			2
others were kept inside the hotels or theaters they were already in			2
eventually , the bomb squad was called in			1
that 's the guy in the gray suit just to the left of center of your screen there			1
inside the suv , they found a device made from gasoline cans , propane tanks , fireworks and electric clocks			2
police say it apparently did n't work			2
instead of exploding , it just filled the suv with smoke			2
the vehicle was taken out of @entity4 yesterday			2
officials have started an investigation into the whole thing			2
they 're checking the vehicle and its contents for fingerprints			2
they 're going over surveillance footage and amateur videos from @entity4 to see if they can identify who left the suv there			2
authorities are treating this incident as a potential terrorist attack			1
@entity97 @entity29 : next stop , @entity98			2
officials there are making some predictions about an oil spill in the @entity103			1
@entity104 , the secretary of the interior , is warning the region to prepare for the worst			2
several government officials think the leak could continue for weeks			2
the fishing industry in part of the @entity103 will be shut down for at least 10 days			2
all of this started with an explosion on an offshore oil rig last month			1
the rig sank ; it caused a leak			2
and now , more than a million and a half gallons of oil have spilled into the @entity103			1
the @entity117 and the company that owns the rig are both doing what they can to contain this spill			1
president @entity123 , who visited the region yesterday , says those efforts will keep going for as long as it takes			1
@entity127 president @entity123 : i 'm not going to rest , and none of the gentlemen and women who are here are going to rest or be satisfied , until the leak is stopped at the source , the oil on the gulf is contained and cleaned up , and the people of this region are able to go back to their lives and their livelihoods			1
currently , the most advanced technology available is being used to try and stop a leak that is more than 5,000 feet under the surface			2
because this leak is unique and unprecedented , it could take many days to stop			2
that 's why we 're also using every resource available to stop the oil from coming ashore and mitigating the damage it could cause			1
severe storms @entity29 : @entity154 from the @entity155 , a couple states are recovering from severe weather			1
parts of @entity6 were hit by heavy storms , possible tornadoes on friday			2
about two dozen others were hurt			2
meanwhile , " extremely dangerous " flooding in @entity7 is responsible for at least five deaths over the weekend			2
@entity164 got between 6 and 10 inches of rain in just 12 hours on saturday			0
the city 's mayor called it " one of the most severe rain events @entity164 has ever experienced			1
" he urged people to stay home and off the roads			0
there was more rain in the forecast for @entity7 yesterday			0
teacher @entity176 @entity29 : well , it 's time to give a little thanks to your teachers ! this is @entity176			1
and to celebrate , we want you to head to our blog and talk about your favorites			0
but put some thought into this one			0
tell us how your teachers make a difference in your lives			0
it could be by showing you @entity0			0
if you want to go for some extra credit , and we know you want some extra credit , send us an @entity193 for @entity176			0
you can do it all at @entity195			0
immigration reform @entity29 : the issue of immigration getting a lot of attention right now			0
part of the reason seems to be a new law in @entity8			0
we covered that last week			0
the law requires any immigrants in @entity8 to have immigration documents with them at all times			0
it also requires police to question anyone who might be in the @entity127 illegally			1
over the weekend , thousands of people protested the @entity8 law			0
officials said 50,000 people marched in this demonstration in @entity217			0
there were similar protests in @entity5 , @entity220 and @entity8			0
critics of the law argue it will lead to racial profiling			0
they claim police will question people about their immigration status based mostly on their race			0
now , @entity8 governor @entity229 is working to address that criticism by making some changes to the law			0
she signed those changes into effect friday			0
this is the big difference			0
originally , police officers in @entity8 could stop anyone based simply on a " reasonable suspicion " that they might be in the country illegally			0
now , officers can only ask people about their immigration status while the officers are enforcing some other law ; maybe speeding , maybe loitering			0
governor @entity242 says the changes " make it crystal clear and undeniable that racial profiling is illegal and will not be tolerated in @entity8			0
" @entity247 @entity248 , @entity24 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity251 's social studies classes at @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity254 ! what type of musician is most likely to perform a cappella ? you know what to do ! is it a : a ) cellist , b ) guitarist , c ) drummer or @entity265 ) @entity266 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! since a cappella means " without instrumental support , " a singer is the right choice here			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! virtual choir @entity29 : nearly 200 singers raised their voices in a choir performance recently			1
they did n't need any instrumental support , but they did get some help from technology			0
when the curtain went up , they were n't really there ! @entity286 takes note of how the ethereal ensemble came together			1
( begin video ) @entity291 - @entity290 , reporter , @entity293 , @entity294 : at first , it may seem strange that @entity296 is all alone , given choirs are all about making music together			1
@entity299 [ singing in latin ] : singing " @entity302			0
" @entity291 - @entity290 : the 20 - year - old music major at the @entity304 , singing to his computer a popular choral piece called " @entity302			1
" @entity307 : i recorded a video on my webcam along with the audio and then uploaded it to @entity312			0
@entity291 - @entity290 : on its own , a rather ordinary video			1
but @entity315 of @entity316 did the same			0
so did @entity317 in @entity318			0
videos that kept coming in on @entity312 , the different parts of the same song			0
@entity323 of @entity7 , [ singing in latin ] : singing " @entity302 " @entity291 - @entity290 : all singing to an instructional video from composer - conductor @entity327			1
@entity307 : everybody had to sync up their video to his video at the start of this beep			0
@entity291 - @entity290 : producer @entity334 put all those clips together ; this , the extraordinary result : the conductor and the 185 voices on @entity312			1
@entity307 : these people are from everywhere			0
12 different countries represented in this video			0
@entity291 - @entity290 : a choir unlike any other			1
@entity307 : there are people in @entity346 in this video			0
i 've never been to @entity346 and maybe i never will , but here i am in this video singing with someone in @entity346			0
@entity291 - @entity290 : composer @entity327 wrote he found the final product overwhelming			1
the poetic symbolism about our shared humanity and the need to connect			0
@entity307 : all you needed to participate was a webcam and a microphone			0
i think it 's the future of creating music			1
@entity291 - @entity290 : and @entity361 says he hopes to one day compose an original piece for the virtual choir with hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people singing alone , together			1
( @entity366 ) before we go @entity29 : really great stuff there			0
well , last but not least today , it 's not a sun dress			1
it 's a @entity373 dress ! and it 's not just for senior prom , it 's for a senior project ! if not @entity377			1
the ingredients : 117 packets of juice ! one boyfriend to help drink all that juice			0
some thread , some hot glue , three weeks to assemble			0
all of it added up to a passing grade and a one - of - a - kind , if not comfortable - kind , of couture			1
goodbye @entity29 : now , if you 're unsure how to address such a dress , just remember that in fashion , you always reap what you sew			0
we are piecing together more stories for you , so tomorrow , be sure to try us on for size			1
i 'm @entity27 ; we 'll see you then !			0
