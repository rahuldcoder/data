editor 's note : @entity2 is the @entity3 in @entity4 at the @entity5			1
he was general counsel of the @entity6 and @entity7 in the @entity9 administration , and is the co-author of two books on @entity12 and @entity14 @entity13 and supporter of @entity16 , he occasionally serves as a volunteer surrogate for the campaign			0
@entity2 says @entity19 blocked reform that could have headed off the costly bailout			1
@entity22 ( @entity23 ) -- in announcing the takeover of @entity12 and @entity26 , treasury secretary @entity24 noted that the " flawed business model " of these companies was in part responsible for their failure			1
@entity12 and @entity26 are called government sponsored enterprises ( @entity32 ) because they have government charters and perform a government mission : providing liquidity to the mortgage market and assisting in the financing of affordable housing			1
the flaw in their business model is that they are owned by private shareholders but backed by the government			1
as a result , lenders do not care about the risks the companies are taking because they know that the government will eventually step in to protect them against losses on their loans			1
that meant @entity12 and @entity53 were able to borrow funds in the capital markets at very low rates and in essentially unlimited amounts			2
this allowed them to grow in both size and profitability over the last 20 years , doubling every five years			0
now we see the consequences -- the @entity6 has been compelled to step in with a rescue plan that has been estimated at the outset to require what @entity24 estimated could be about $ 200 billion of taxpayer money			0
concerns about the flawed business models of @entity12 and @entity53 are nothing new			2
many people , including such experts as @entity72 , have been arguing for years that @entity12 and @entity53 should be reined in , that they were creating huge risks for the taxpayers , and that eventually these turkeys would come home to lay their eggs			2
ireport.com : are foreclosures driving down your neighborhood 's value ? these warnings began in earnest near the end of the @entity87 administration , especially by secretary of the treasury @entity88 , and were carried forward by the @entity91 administration , which supported legislation that would provide stronger regulation for @entity12 and @entity53			0
but these warnings were ignored in @entity19			1
although there were efforts by a number of @entity13 in the @entity98 and @entity99 to adopt tougher regulatory legislation -- beginning in 1999 -- these efforts were resisted by @entity102 , primarily sen. @entity103 of @entity104 and sen. @entity105 of @entity106 , who is currently the chairman of the @entity99 committee with jurisdiction over the @entity32			0
to their credit , when the problems of @entity12 and @entity53 finally became too obvious to ignore , the @entity102 in the @entity98 and @entity99 voted for stronger regulation of the two companies and to give the secretary of the treasury broad authority to bail them out			1
but by then it was far too late to save the taxpayers			2
in the current election season , the @entity118 people should want to know why it is that they as taxpayers will now be compelled to bail out these companies			1
@entity16 was one of the @entity13 who supported @entity32 reform , but he and the others faced an insurmountable defensive phalanx in @entity19 -- the result of a strong lobbying and political support program engineered and operated over many years by @entity12 and @entity14 the fact that the @entity13 controlled @entity19 during much of this period shows the validity of @entity16 's comment in his convention acceptance speech that " we were elected to change @entity22 , and we let @entity22 change us			1
" among other things , @entity12 and @entity53 orchestrated substantial contributions to the campaign funds of their congressional supporters			0
they hired some former congressional staff members as lobbyists and engaged lobbying firms that had strong relationships with members of @entity19 , including lobbyists who are active in both of this year 's presidential campaigns they got people who were homebuilders , realtors and members of the securities industry -- all groups that profited from @entity12 and @entity53 's activities -- to hold fundraising events for key members of @entity19 of both parties ; they staged ribbon - cuttings and other events in the congressional districts of their supporters in order to provide them with favorable publicity ; they established charitable arms that contributed to community groups who in turn supported them when some in @entity19 sought tougher regulation			1
this is a prominent example of @entity22 's culture of corruption			0
the government put its credit behind the two companies ; this enabled them to grow and dominate the housing finance market ; they used their resulting financial and political power to gain and retain the support of key members of @entity19 ; and the process continued until they collapsed -- at which time the taxpayers have to clean things up			1
this could all have been prevented if @entity19 had acted years ago to eliminate the @entity32 business model			1
there are three possible models -- privatization , nationalization or liquidation			0
@entity19 and the president can decide which it will be , but the worst idea is to reconstitute them as @entity32			2
unfortunately , that seems to be the choice treasury secretary @entity24 made in the plan he announced sunday			0
in that plan , a conservator will be appointed for @entity12 and @entity53 , and they will be nursed back to financial health with injections of taxpayer funds by the @entity6			0
a conservator has only the power to stabilize the companies			2
a better idea would have been to appoint a receiver , who could have wound down the companies over time and prepared them for one of the three possible future models			0
instead , the failed business model is likely to be kept in place because of its support in @entity19			1
it is thus no surprise that sen. @entity103 was quoted as follows right after the @entity24 plan was announced : " this plan will be met with broad acceptance in @entity19 because it does n't prejudge the ultimate fate of @entity12 and @entity14 '' we know what that means			2
the @entity118 people sense that something is seriously wrong in @entity22			0
the @entity12 and @entity53 debacle shows how right they are			0
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : mortgage *giants* are government - backed , private companies
the flawed model let them borrow regardless of risk , @entity2 says
now taxpayers are stuck with paying billions to bail them out , he says
