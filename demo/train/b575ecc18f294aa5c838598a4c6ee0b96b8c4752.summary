-- maybe it was the sound of the wind cutting through the wire			2
perhaps he caught a small vibration with his keen eyes			2
or it could have been a slight difference in the air 's smell			2
whatever it was , when @entity11 noticed that his @entity13 handler , @entity12 , was creeping down the wrong path in the @entity16 jungle , the @entity18 shepherd did something he 'd never done out in the field : he looked at @entity12 and barked , before taking a seat			1
" when he sat down , i knew there was a trip wire			2
i was one step away from it , " remembered @entity12 , who with his dog in 1969 was " walking point , " leading the way for a dozen soldiers			1
had the hidden explosive device been tripped , " it would have gotten half of us			2
" more than 40 years later , the gratitude and love @entity12 , 59 , feels for the dog he served with is as strong as ever			1
and it 's for this reason that @entity12 , president of the @entity38 , drove from his @entity40 , @entity41 , home to be in @entity42 this week			1
about 200 @entity16 dog handlers , who were trained to read and communicate with their canine partners , have gathered for a reunion			1
and on saturday they 'll join an expected several thousand others for the 10th anniversary rededication of the @entity50 at the @entity51 in @entity52			1
during the @entity16 , more than 4,000 dogs served in various positions , said @entity55 , a military dog historian and author of " forever forward : k - 9 operations in @entity16			1
" the scout dogs , such as @entity11 , walked with their handlers ahead of patrols -- making them the first target for ambushes or hidden explosives			1
there were also sentry dogs who guarded bases , tracker dogs who followed the trail of enemies and mine and booby trap dogs who sniffed out dangers hidden beneath the ground			1
the @entity79 placed a bounty on the dogs because they were so effective , @entity55 said			1
all told , he estimated the k - 9 teams averted more than 10,000 casualties			1
but at the end of the war , only about 200 dogs came home			1
the rest who had survived were either euthanized or turned over to the @entity90 -- left behind , a surplus of war			1
" they were treated as obsolete equipment			0
and if you were a handler , you could n't see them that way , " said @entity95 , 61 , who keeps a framed picture of himself and @entity97 , the black lab and shepherd mix he worked with , atop his desk in @entity101 , @entity102			0
" when that 's your dog , that 's your dog			2
he sees you in danger , he 's going to respond			0
unconditional love -- it 's all for you			0
you ca n't help but love him			0
" on patrols , @entity95 used hand motions to speak to @entity97			0
in turn , the animal spoke back through his movements			0
his ears would shoot up and turn in the direction of suspicious noise			0
the hair on his back would stand up if danger was close			0
if he wanted @entity124 to stop moving , he 'd look back at him			0
off - duty , @entity97 was playful			0
he liked to have his neck scratched and would roll around on the ground			0
the 110 - pound dog would cuddle up to @entity95 at night when they were out in the field , and he 'd eat out of his handler 's helmet			2
whenever @entity95 could , he 'd give his closest friend steak			0
the men who 'd walk behind the pair on missions were always different			0
but a scout handler and his dog were a constant , as the duo bounced between different assignments			2
when @entity141 , founder and former ceo of @entity144 pet foods , first learned about the dogs who 'd served and the fate of so many of them , he set out to teach others			1
based on about three years of research , he co-produced the documentary " @entity152 : @entity154 's @entity153 , " which first aired 11 years ago on the @entity155			1
donations earned through this film allowed @entity141 , now president of the @entity50 , to commission three monuments , sculptures featuring a @entity18 shepherd and his handler			1
the first one was unveiled at the @entity164 in @entity52			0
a second was installed at @entity166 , @entity102			0
the third remains in storage , @entity141 said			0
the original goal to place it in @entity170 beside the @entity171 or at @entity172 in @entity173 remains an elusive dream			0
dogs have long served with the @entity154 military , said @entity55 , who also wrote " @entity152 : @entity177			1
" during @entity180 , the dogs borrowed from the @entity181 and @entity182 worked as messengers and assisted the @entity184 by finding the wounded on battlefields , he said			2
the @entity154 k - 9 corps , @entity55 said , really began during @entity188 , when , among other tasks , thousands of dogs donated by civilians patrolled shorelines			1
back then , dogs sent abroad were retrained and returned to civilian life , but that practice had changed by the time @entity154 forces entered @entity16 , @entity55 said			1
later , galvanized by the attention earned through the documentary , @entity16 dog handlers began to call for change			1
@entity201 , 60 , had n't spoken to another dog handler in 30 years when he showed up in @entity170 for his first reunion in 2000			1
but as he talked to the 250 others in attendance , he realized the power of what they shared			0
" you go through the war , and you always remember the bond you have , the bond with the dog , " said @entity201 , whose dog @entity210 once yanked him up a bank from a rice paddy , out of the way of mortar fire			2
" on that first trip to the [ @entity171 ] wall , it was a reunion with the spirits of our dogs			2
" later , @entity201 , of @entity226 , @entity227 , would go on to write his own book and establish a traveling exhibit to pay tribute to the dogs who 'd served			1
in november 2000 , president @entity234 signed into law legislation that established a military working dog adoption program			1
now the dogs working in @entity238 and @entity239 will have a chance to find comfortable homes when they return from war			1
for @entity12 , of the @entity38 , this has been a blessing			0
he said leaving his partner sarge behind , all those decades ago , haunted him			0
" a lot of us [ handlers ] suffered @entity249 , " he said , referring to post-traumatic stress disorder			0
" it 's like leaving your kid back there			0
" but he now has @entity254 , the war dog he adopted from @entity256 in @entity257 , @entity41			2
the @entity18 shepherd , who has hip problems , looks uncannily like @entity11 , he said , and having him around is a source of comfort			0
" i 'm taking care of an old vet , " @entity12 said , " and he 's taking care of me			0

several thousand *people* will gather saturday at a @entity50 in @entity42
of the more than 4,000 dogs who served in @entity16 , only about 200 came home
dogs , many of them euthanized , help to avert more than 10,000 casualties , historian estimates
in 2000 , the @entity154 changed *policy* , setting up a military working dog adoption program
