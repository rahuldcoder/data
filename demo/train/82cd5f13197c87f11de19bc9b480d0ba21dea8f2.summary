-- a junior professor drives his doppler on wheels mobile radar trucks through @entity4 , @entity5 , less than 90 seconds after a tornado has torn a path of destruction through the city			1
debris -- pieces of homes -- falls from the sky onto his truck			0
the scene is shocking ; wrecks of houses covered with dirt are all that is left in the twister 's path , and people are still huddled underground in shelters			1
the professor does n't know it yet , but he has just recorded 302 mph winds in the core of the vortex , the strongest wind speed ever measured anywhere in the world			1
he does n't learn until later that his wife and baby are in a shelter just 3 miles south of the tornado			1
forty - six people died in tornadoes that day			1
i was chasing twisters with the dow radars -- mobile weather radars driven up to tornadoes to make ultra-fine detail , @entity46 maps of the winds and debris			0
i was trying to learn more about how tornadoes form , about how the winds cause destruction , with the optimistic hope that this would soon lead to better forecasts , longer warning lead times , fewer false alarms , fewer deaths			1
tornado prediction is improving , scientists say in 1999 , tornado warnings were issued by the @entity60 an average of 13 short minutes before touchdown , and the false alarm rate was a whopping 75 %			1
the same remains essentially true now			1
and on monday , my team and several other teams of really smart scientists with mobile radars and other equipment independently concluded -- incorrectly -- that southern @entity5 , about 50 miles south of @entity4 , was at the highest risk of strong tornadoes			0
we all missed the opportunity to collect data in the @entity4 tornado			1
opinion : we love and fear the @entity5 skies why ? why have n't scientists and all the smart forecasters been able to improve tornado forecasts ? and why , even when communities like @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity81 , @entity82 , ( devasted by a tornado in 2011 ) and others are warned sometimes 30 minutes ahead of time do so many people die ? we ca n't expect that there will be zero deaths from tornadoes , but can we do better ? for people to be safe from tornadoes , several things must happen			1
scientists need to better understand the details of how tornadoes form , what events precede tornado formation , and how to better distinguish between thunderstorms that will make tornadoes and the overwhelming majority that will not			2
then , forecasters need to be able to integrate that knowledge with observations , mainly from the national network of government weather surveillance radars and computer simulations to detect tornado precursors			2
warnings need to be effectively communicated to those most at risk , using traditional methods such as sirens and weather radio and new media like @entity115			2
finally , those who are warned need to heed these warnings and take immediate and effective precautions			1
opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado in recent years , scientists have learned much about tornadoes			2
the @entity124 's @entity123 have mapped the winds in nearly 200 different tornadoes , large and small , during birth and death , and while passing through towns			0
scientists , supported by the foundation and the @entity132 , are analyzing nearly 30 terabytes of data , -- the equivalent of about 8,000 dvds -- collected during @entity136 ( or @entity137 in @entity138 )			0
@entity136 is the largest and most ambitious tornado study in history -- begun in 2009 -- in which 100 scientists in 50 scientific vehicles surrounded and probed tornadic super-cell thunderstorms			2
the formation of tornadoes is hard to predict , but we are making headway in identifying potential precursors			0
but , as our missed forecasts for @entity4 show , we have a long way to go			0
even with the most sophisticated instruments , we ca n't tell even 20 minutes ahead of time whether a super-cell will become a tornado			2
opinion : the extraordinary courage of teachers the public and local governments have a critical role to play			0
no matter what warnings are issued by forecasters , every adult 's safety is ultimately in his or her own hands			2
one has to choose first to heed a warning			1
then , critically , one has to have a safe place to go			0
in particular , buildings hosting the most vulnerable -- schools and hospitals -- need to have hardened shelters			0
communities need to enforce the most basic and inexpensive good building practices so that roofs are attached securely to walls , which are anchored to foundations , so that buildings are more resistant to tornadoes			0
@entity4 in bull 's - eye twice , science may know why i believe that we are doing a pretty good job at all of this			0
while the tolls in @entity4 and @entity81 are tragic , most people who lived and worked in even the worst swaths of destruction survived			0
during the 1999 tornado , for example , more than 400 homes were completely destroyed -- not just some walls down , but all walls down -- but only about 40 people died			1
many thousands lived in the paths of the 2011 @entity81 and 2013 @entity4 tornadoes , and only a small fraction died			0
but we can and should do much better			0
tornado deaths can be reduced , if not to zero then still substantially			1
it will take the continued efforts of scientists , forecasters , builders , community planners and ultimately the people who live in the path of the most intensely destructive phenomenon			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 : **research** has improved tornado tracking , but it remains *imprecise* , *flawed*
he says warning speed , false alarms change little . people still die . we must do better
he says *synthesis* of **research** , radar observation will help . communications must improve
@entity212 : @entity229 must heed warnings , build tornado - proof *structures* , to bring deaths to zero
