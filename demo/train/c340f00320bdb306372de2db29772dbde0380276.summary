-- a popular pain - relief treatment that uses electricity to stimulate nerves is n't likely to benefit the millions of @entity5 who live with chronic low back pain and should n't be recommended for that purpose , new guidelines say			1
@entity10 electric nerve stimulation , or @entity11 , is delivered using a small battery - operated generator connected to a set of electrodes			1
the generator , about the size of a @entity17 , transmits a weak electric current through the electrodes , which are attached to the skin at the site of chronic pain or at other key points			1
despite their popularity , there is little evidence that these devices are effective for chronic low back pain , according to the guidelines from the @entity30 , which were published wednesday in the journal @entity32			1
" physicians are advised against ordering @entity11 for patients with chronic low back pain since it is proven not to work , " says the lead author of the guidelines , @entity33 , @entity35 , a professor of neurology at the @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity39			1
@entity0 : how yoga can relieve back pain @entity33 and his colleague based the guidelines on a review of past studies that compared @entity11 with a sham @entity11 procedure ( a mock treatment equivalent to a placebo ) for chronic low back pain , which is defined as pain lasting three months or more			1
they turned up just five studies in all			0
two high - quality studies found that @entity11 produced no benefit ; the other studies had mixed results , but they were considered to be less reliable			0
@entity0 : all the right moves to avoid back pain the relative dearth of research on @entity11 and chronic low back pain suggests that the new guidelines should n't be accepted as gospel , according to @entity65 , @entity35 , and @entity66 , @entity35 , neurologists at @entity68 , in @entity69 , @entity70 , who wrote an editorial accompanying the new guidelines			1
" [ a ] bsence of evidence is not evidence of absence , " they wrote			0
although the research on @entity11 may be thin , they added , " there seems to be considerable empirical evidence that , at least in some patients , @entity11 is useful			2
" @entity65 and @entity66 point out that , unlike opiates and other pain medications -- which carry a risk of side effects , including abuse and addiction -- @entity11 is a safe , fast - acting , and user - friendly treatment that has very few side effects , does n't interact with medications , and can be stopped at any time if it is n't effective			1
@entity0 : is chronic pain ruining your relationship ? the treatment is also relatively affordable			0
@entity11 units can be purchased for less than $ 100 , although some models cost several hundred dollars or more			0
there certainly is a market for the devices			0
back pain is the second most common cause of disability in the @entity5 after arthritis , according to the @entity107			1
eight out of 10 adults will experience low back pain at some point in their lives by some estimates , although 95 percent of those cases will get better within three months			2
@entity115 , the director of outpatient physical therapy at @entity117 in @entity118 , says that because of the treatment 's upside , @entity11 may still be worth recommending to patients with chronic back pain for whom other treatments have come up short			1
" we use @entity11 as a last resort in people with chronic back pain who are not improving with other measures , " he says			1
" i say , let 's give it a try in these patients			0
we have had some who swear by it and a lot who say , ' it worked for a couple of weeks , but then i returned it to the vendor			0
' " @entity0 : 5 natural fixes for back pain exactly how @entity11 works -- or whether it does work -- is n't known			1
experts believe that the electrical current may overstimulate the nerves that sense pain , confusing the brain in the process and blocking out the real pain signals			2
" @entity11 likely has a placebo effect , but its safety and side effect profile makes it an ideal tool in approaching chronic pain syndromes , " says @entity153 , @entity35 , @entity154 , a neurologist at the @entity155 in @entity156			2
in contrast to the findings on low back pain , the new guidelines state that @entity11 may be useful in treating nerve pain associated with diabetes , which affects up to 70 percent of people with the disease			1
two studies have found that @entity11 has some positive effects on diabetic nerve pain , but because neither of them compared tens with any other treatment options , it remains unclear when @entity11 is most appropriate to use in such cases , the guidelines say			2
@entity0 : diet tips for pain patients " no recommendations can be made about when to use @entity11 compared to other treatments for diabetic nerve pain , " says @entity33			2
@entity115 says that , in his experience , @entity11 has indeed proven effective for diabetic nerve pain			2
" this is a whole different type of pain than typical low back pain , and my patients with diabetic nerve pain swear by it , " he says			1
" if they do n't use tens they will have a bad day , and if they do use it they will feel better			0
" in the new guidelines , @entity33 and his colleague call for more studies of @entity11 , particularly in people who have never used the devices before			0
future studies should also try to determine the optimal way to administer @entity11 , they write			0
in the meantime , says @entity115 -- and the new guidelines notwithstanding -- patients have little reason not to try @entity11			0
" try it , see if it works ; if it does n't , return it , " he says			0
" it 's worth a shot , because there are n't too many significant side effects			0

@entity10 electric nerve stimulation does n't help back pain , study finds
@entity11 transmits weak electric current through electrodes at pain site
other experts say research is *insufficient* to completely dismiss @entity11 ' value
back pain is the second most common cause of disability in the @entity5 after arthritis
