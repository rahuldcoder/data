-- six weeks ago , " @entity7 " entered theaters and blew everyone 's expectations out of the water with its record - breaking $ 207.4 million debut			1
in the weeks that followed , though , the box office fell into a bit of a slump			0
expensive tentpoles like " battleship " and " @entity14 " outright bombed , while major studio fare like " what to expect when you 're expecting " and " @entity18 " underperformed , and even " @entity19 's " number one opening felt weak given its predecessors ' strength			0
last weekend , " @entity27 and the @entity28 " exceeded industry expectations , giving @entity25 hope that summer 2012 might live up to the hype that " @entity7 " had suggested			0
this weekend , " @entity29 3 : @entity36 's @entity35 " and and " @entity37 " continued to ease any fears that the box office was in trouble with robust debuts in first and second place , respectively			1
these hefty starts helped the @entity40 films gross $ 169.6 million , up a whopping 30 percent over the same weekend in 2011 , when @entity41 topped the chart			1
@entity43 $ 145 million 3 - d sequel " @entity29 3 : @entity36 's @entity35 , " which features the voice work of @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and @entity52 as lost @entity54 animals , handily won the weekend with $ 60.4 million , 45 percent of which came from @entity47 ticket sales			1
that 's a touch behind 2008â € ²s " @entity29 : @entity56 , " which started with $ 63.1 million , despite the fact that " @entity29 3 " earned more on its opening day than " @entity56 " ( $ 20.5 million vs. $ 17.5 million )			1
it looks like this threequel may suffer from a slight case of sequelitis , when franchise films become increasingly front - loaded at the box office as the franchise continues			0
" @entity29 3 " earned a terrific " a " @entity67 grade from polled audiences , which were 56 percent female and 54 percent below the age of 25 , and it will benefit from strong word - of - mouth in the weeks to come			1
still , " @entity29 3 " will likely finish a bit behind the $ 180 million total that " @entity56 , " which played during the holiday season , earned domestically			1
international grosses are already proving to be more substantial , though			0
" @entity29 3 " earned $ 75.5 million overseas this weekend , giving it an early worldwide total of $ 135.9 million			1
the colorful comedy will face direct competition when @entity80 's " brave " debuts in two weeks , but its lighthearted tone and zippy pace may prove more attractive for summer moviegoers			0
we 'll have to wait and see ! @entity86 's return to sci - fi , " @entity37 , " invaded theaters in second place with $ 50 million			1
the $ 130 million @entity91 thriller , which stars @entity92 , @entity93 , and current box office ( ice ) queen @entity96 , conjured an impressive $ 14,723 per theater average from 3,396 locations ( ahead of " @entity29 's " $ 14,123 average from 4,258 venues )			1
" @entity37 " notched the best debut for an r - rated picture since " @entity103 's " $ 52.6 million bow in october , but where it goes from here is anyone 's guess			1
after topping the box office on friday with $ 21.4 million , " @entity37 " sank 22 percent on saturday -- a sure sign of built - in excitement from fanboys and fangirls who rushed to the theater to find out if the film really was an " @entity117 " prequel			1
discouragingly , " @entity37 " earned a lukewarm " b " @entity67 grade , yet it 's sparking more post-release conversation than any title in recent memory , and although much of the chatter is negative ( and filled with over-the - top vitriol for scribe @entity125 ) , all the buzz could work in the film 's favor			1
word - of - mouth does n't suggest that " @entity37 " will become this year 's " inception , " a thinky thriller - turned - box - office - smash , but its successful debut and ample international receipts ( it 's earned $ 91.5 million after two weekends ) should have the suits at @entity91 pretty happy			1
last weekend 's fairest movie of them all , " @entity140 , " bit into the poison apple of competition and dropped 59 percent to $ 23 million during its second frame			1
the $ 170 million fantasy has earned $ 98.5 million total after ten days , and another $ 83.5 million overseas			2
@entity144 is reportedly fast - tracking a sequel for the film , which frankly seems like a rather irrational decision at this point			0
while a $ 181.5 million worldwide total is nothing to shake a stick scepter at , between the budget , marketing costs , and distribution fees , " @entity27 " has a long way to go before it 's out of the red			2
still , @entity144 must see a path to profitability on the home market and ancillary markets			0
if the studio does make a sequel , i have one request : bring back @entity96 ! " @entity19 " held on to fourth place , dropping 52 percent ( after losing many @entity47 screens to " @entity37 " and " @entity29 " ) to $ 13.5 million			1
the $ 230 million sequel has earned a lackluster $ 135.5 million after 17 days -- even without accounting for inflation , both " @entity173 " and " @entity174 " ( neither of which had @entity47 ticket prices working their favor ) had earned more money at the same point in their runs , with $ 158.9 million and $ 148.0 million , respectively			2
the @entity179 production may finish with about $ 165 million , domestically			2
fortunately , international grosses have been powerful , and globally , " @entity19 " has earned $ 487.6 million total			2
whether the film will eventually earn enough to counteract it 's massive negative costs is unclear			0
( speaking of negative costs , are you aware that the combined budgets of the @entity189 movies right now total $ 895 million ? seriously			2
) rounding out the @entity40 5 , " @entity7 " flew to $ 10.8 million in its sixth frame -- a 47 percent drop -- which pushed its total to a truly heroic $ 571.9 million			2
worldwide , " @entity7 " has grossed a jaw - dropping $ 1.396 billion			0
this year 's second - biggest blockbuster , " @entity194 , " reached a major milestone over the weekend			2
on its 80th day of release , " @entity202 " passed the $ 400 million mark in the @entity199 -- a remarkable feat for a franchise launching pad			2
with a $ 248 million overseas total , the dystopian thriller has n't exhibited similar box office ubiquity overseas , although this may very well change with future " @entity202 " installments			0
the film 's worldwide total will climb substantially when it opens in @entity210 later this month			0
in limited release , @entity212 's well - liked indie " @entity211 " continues to impress			0
the young love story picked up $ 1.6 million in 96 theaters , enough for a tenth place finish			1
" @entity222 " once again boasted a dazzling per theater average : it 's $ 16,448 average was the best at the box office			0
after three weekends , the film has earned $ 3.8 million			0
fellow indies were met with mixed results			0
" @entity232 " found a weak $ 102,000 out of 30 theaters , which was slightly ahead of @entity229 fave " @entity230 , " which earned $ 100,000 , but was notably playing in just 9 theaters			0
" @entity236 " earned $ 34,100 out of 4 theaters , yielding an $ 8,525 average -- too low to merit major expansions			0
what did you see this weekend ? do you think " @entity37 " will crash and burn from here , or do you think curiosity and buzz will attract more audiences ? sound off in the comments , box office junkies ! 1			2
