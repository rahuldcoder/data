-- in graduate school and as a mountaineer and nature photographer , i 've visited many of the world 's great mountain ranges and seen hundreds of glaciers			2
in spite of this , i did n't understand how fast truly enormous quantities of ice could disappear until 2005 when i went to @entity13 and shot a story for @entity16 magazine			1
this led to a 2006 @entity15 assignment to document changing glaciers in various parts of the @entity21 and @entity22			2
by the time this cover story was done , the @entity23 was born			1
@entity23 merges art and science to give visual voice to the planet 's changing ecosystems			1
through time - lapse imagery and other innovative methods , @entity23 documents and communicates environmental impacts from global warming and other human - made causes while inspiring action among citizens and policymakers			1
time - lapse photography captures the speed at which glaciers are retreating in places such as @entity43 , @entity13 , @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity46			0
watch video and see @entity23 project here			1
@entity23 is a collaboration between image - makers and leading environmental scientists , all of us devoted to documenting the changes transforming @entity54 and alpine landscapes today			1
we do this because shrinking glaciers are the canary in the global coal mine , the most visible , tangible manifestations of climate change on the planet			2
the survey is extreme in every way -- distances , costs , logistics , field conditions			0
truth be told , there are times when i wonder why i 'm putting myself through this ordeal			0
but other voices , asking different questions , ultimately provide the answers			0
i picture myself 30 years from now			0
i hear my daughters @entity77 and @entity78 saying with a certain amount of anger and exasperation : " @entity82 , with what everyone knew back in 2009 , how could people not have realized the climate was changing ? " and then they ask the personal zinger : " what were you doing about it ? " hindsight can be merciless			1
people of any given era often look back in time and wonder how their predecessors could have been so dimwitted			1
how could the @entity96 navy have taken hundreds of years to make limes and other antiscorbutics a standard part of sailors ' diets ? the cure for scurvy was known to @entity105 navigators as early as the 1500s			0
during three epic voyages of the 1770s , capt. @entity107 forced his crews to eat sauerkraut , which was later shown to be rich in vitamin c. he lost not a single man to the disease			0
yet the @entity96 admiralty waited until 1867 before mandating that its sailors eat limes to stay healthy			0
when the future looks back at the late 20th and early 21st centuries , people will be as astounded at our mule - headedness about dealing with climate change , as we now are at the foibles of earlier societies			1
unfortunately , the astonishing pace of climatic events , as witnessed in the ice , does n't give us the luxury of time to be slow learners			1
we can not afford to be hamstrung by ponderous social institutions or deluded by false information			1
we must make a major effort to stop climate change right now , and not think we can absolve ourselves of responsibility by educating our children to do things differently			0
a generation from now will be too late			0
the voices of the future -- our grown - up children -- will damn us if we are passive and indifferent			0
as i head to @entity145 , @entity146 , for the @entity147 , i hope to bring the extraordinary evidence of melting glaciers that my colleagues and i at the @entity23 have worked so hard to collect to both the climate - change believers and the skeptics			1
i hope to attract even more widespread attention to this critical issue , because if we rise to the occasion demanded by a changing climate , we will be heroes			0
descend into collective complacency and dysfunctional denial , and we will someday be judged to have been fools			0
sir @entity160 once said about great deeds , " people do not decide to become extraordinary			2
" the quality of our society and our lives will be judged by the deeds we do or do n't do			2
@entity167 , i was a climate - change skeptic			2
i 'm not one anymore			0
the evidence is in the ice			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			1

@entity173 says he did n't know how fast enormous quantities of ice were vanishing
he says his eyes opened with photo assignments , now heads @entity23
@entity173 says people will look back , wonder how predecessors could 've ignored global warming
once a skeptic , convert says we ca n't afford to wait or be deluded by false information
