the novel captures the end of the jazz age in @entity37 perfectly in the characters ' staccato slang , sounding much like jazz music imagined as dialogue			1
offstage , the story captures the paranoia and fear of the days leading up to the start of the war , and the racial tension of the time period			1
@entity29 narrates , but the band 's brilliant young trumpet player , @entity49 , is the linchpin of the story , a @entity53 who happens to be black			2

" @entity19 " is the second novel from @entity20 , an author with a bit of a globe - hopping past			1
she was born and raised in @entity82 , the daughter of immigrant parents from @entity85			1
she has studied and lived in the @entity26 and across @entity86 , including stops in @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity37			1
now married and mother to an infant daughter , @entity20 lives in @entity92 , @entity93			1
@entity0 recently asked her about the novel in a phone interview and via e-mail			0
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what was the spark behind your book ? @entity20 : i was living in @entity37 at the time , acutely aware of my difference -- being a black woman from @entity82			1
at the same time i 'd been reading about the so - called " @entity107 " -- the half - black children of @entity110 's colonial soldiers from @entity111 stationed in the @entity112 after the close of the @entity114			1
i began imagining their lives in @entity37 , as both outsiders and insiders , and this naturally led to my wondering what must have happened to them during the 1930s , with the rise of @entity123			1
this is where my interest in the novel came from			0
but the book itself more rightly begins with @entity29 's voice , his character , the perplexing problems of loyalty and betrayal in any artistic life			0
@entity0 : you really captured the feel , the language and the tone of the late 1930s @entity86 jazz scene			1
did you research this period extensively before you started writing ? @entity20 : thank you , that 's kind of you to say			1
i researched assiduously , both before and during the writing , to capture the feel of that world			0
but @entity29 's voice is so very particular to sid himself that i would never want it to stand in as some sort of " representative " voice from that time			2
it 's an approximation of the kind of hybrid language he and his band mates were speaking at the time			2
but it 's important to remember , too , that @entity29 is a man straddling two eras -- 1930s @entity86 and 1990s @entity33 -- and the shifts in his rhythms , diction , syntax hopefully capture some of that flavor			2
@entity0 : i pictured you listening to a lot of jazz from this time period while you were writing			1
did you and were there any jazz artists in particular that inspired you ? @entity20 : it 's interesting to hear you say so			1
the music was my constant companion , even more than books			0
not only as a way to lead me back into the novel after each break but also as a kind of consolation			0
there was a strength and faith and promise in it that i think i needed at the time			2
what 's fascinating to me now is to think back on who i was listening to at various points in the novel and read the book with that in mind			0
not only the language itself , but the speed and emotion under the prose finds a corollary in the music			0
or so it seems to me in retrospect			0
among the artists i listened to most often were @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity63			0
@entity0 : your novel focuses on the @entity205 persecution of the @entity207 community			0
what drew you to this little known chapter of @entity211 history ? @entity20 : as the @entity82 - born daughter of @entity85 immigrants , i grew up between worlds , in a sense , aware both of my differences and kinships			1
loyalties were always mixed , and the world inside the walls of my home was significantly different from the world beyond it			0
i did my graduate work at @entity226 , living in @entity33 for a short time , which reinforced this complicated sense of identity			1
and in the years since , i lived on and off in @entity86 , where , as ever , i had periods of feeling profoundly at home and periods of total estrangement			0
i think that sense of uprootedness , that quiet seeking after identity and self , lies at the heart of this novel			1
... in the writing itself , you 're not thinking about such things			0
you just know that there 's a story there , one you want told			0
and you run with it			0
@entity0 : while @entity29 narrates the novel , this really felt like @entity49 's story to me			0
he 's such a compelling character but remains something of an enigma			0
i assume this was by design ? @entity20 : absolutely			1
that unknowability lies at the core of the novel			2
it seemed it would have been an act of extraordinary presumption to take @entity49 's voice , to speak for him , to fill that silence			0
and , too , a way of diminishing the sadness of what he ( and his real - life counterparts ) suffered			2
@entity0 : you come from such an interesting background , the child of @entity85 Ã © @entity272 © parents , born and raised in @entity82			1
you 've studied in a number of countries , including the @entity26 and @entity86			0
you now live in @entity93			0
how has all that world travel influenced you as an artist and a person ? @entity20 : ... there can be something liberating ... for the fiction writer who finds herself caught between worlds			1
an opportunity to observe and inhabit the skins of others			0
i know , for myself , that all of that traveling has impacted the kinds of stories i am drawn to			0
@entity0 : you 're also the mother of a young child			0
has that changed your approach to writing ? @entity20 : oh , it 's still so early to tell -- our daughter is only 6 months old			1
but that , too , is turning out to be a different kind of journey			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity20 : i find myself staring out the windows an awful lot these days , dreaming up the next book			1
but our daughter fills up the immediate hours of the day			2
