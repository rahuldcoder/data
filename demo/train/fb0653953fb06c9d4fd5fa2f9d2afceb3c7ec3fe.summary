@entity1 photographer @entity0 had always dreamed of visiting the @entity4 rainforest in @entity5 , and he finally got his chance last year			1
after two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy , @entity0 arrived at a place some might call a version of @entity12 : the @entity14 reserve where the @entity15 roam			1
" i wanted to show the daily life in the world 's most endangered tribe , " he said			1
the @entity15 's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land , according to @entity5 's @entity23			1
many @entity24 have had little to no contact with the outside world , but that is beginning to change , the foundation reports , as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on			2
@entity0 set out to document the tribe 's existence -- pure , pristine and , tragically , fleeting			1
" i had traveled to @entity34 and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was , " @entity0 said			1
" here i was , in the 21st century , with other humans who ( until recently ) had never seen a camera , a computer ... never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter			2
and yet they are extremely happy			0
" calling themselves @entity15 , @entity46 for " man , " the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters			2
challenges abound , said @entity0 , who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the tribespeople did not speak @entity1			1
" i pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting , " @entity0 recalled			1
" they were incredibly friendly , and i was very well - received			0
" spending weeks without uttering words , @entity0 immersed himself in the visual resplendence of the @entity15 life in the forest			1
twelve - hour hunting expeditions were common , cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains			0
@entity67 's orchestral sounds rang behind every moment , something his photographs seem to allude to			0
social media follow @ @entity72 on @entity73 to join the conversation about photography			0
detouring from the use of formal portraiture often seen in ethnophotography , @entity0 ' black - and - white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an amicable pact with his subjects			1
the @entity15 clearly trusted @entity0 ' camera , and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well - versed he became with the ins and outs of the @entity90 way of life			1
the cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer 's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of sportsmanship			2
" we walked and walked for hours , slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey , " @entity0 said			1
" the @entity90 were barefoot the whole time			2
" @entity0 nonchalantly talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red puma			1
" the hunter had missed a shot , and the puma jumped right over towards me , " he said			0
" in the meantime , i was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite			0
" there are several groups of the @entity15 in this part of the forest			0
some have been known to exist since the 1970s			0
others have been contacted in the early 1980s			0
many are believed to still be in hiding			0
earlier this month , @entity5 's official news agency reported that three isolated @entity24 had made contact with the other mainstream @entity15			0
the group 's leader , @entity123 , reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them			2
the @entity5 government has launched a massive military operation into the states of @entity130 and @entity131 , today the epicenter in the war between loggers and @entity24			2
latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved			0
monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge			0
in the meantime , how can the so - called civilized world understand what is being lost ? @entity0 tries to explain : " getting out of my comfort zone , my comfortable bed , to walk for hours through virgin forest , crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck ... hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren -- this experience can completely change a human being			2
" @entity0 is a photographer based in @entity157			1
you can follow him on @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 .			0

photographer @entity0 spent time with an endangered tribe in the @entity4
the people did n't speak his language , and they communicated with hand gestures
illegal loggers are moving into their *territory* and threatening their way of life
