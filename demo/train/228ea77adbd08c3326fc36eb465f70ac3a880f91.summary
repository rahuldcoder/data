was forced to land prematurely in @entity3 , after pilots shut down one of its engines			1
flight @entity7 with 171 people on board was en route from @entity12 to @entity13 when an oil pressure warning was received , forcing the pilots to terminate the flight eight hours in			1
" at the approach to @entity20 the oil pressure was getting low , so the engine was shutdown , " a @entity2 spokesperson told @entity0			1
" when one engine of an aircraft with twin engines is stopped , the airline must declare an emergency so the flight can have priority to be guided by air traffic control and apply for landing			1
" there was no injured passenger or crew			2
" it was not battery trouble ; the cause is being investigated			2
" hairline cracks discovered the diversion came just days after @entity1 's announcement that hairline cracks had been found in the wings of 40 in - production planes			1
while teething problems are common with most new models of aircraft -- the @entity1 fleet was famously grounded in january 2013 after numerous problems with its battery -- @entity1 admits that reliability is a work in progress			2
" the @entity1 has a dispatch reliability rate of 98 % , " @entity53 , @entity1 's communications director @entity54 told @entity0			0
" but we 're improving that all the time , to get it up to where the 777 and 737 are -- above 99 %			0
" dispatch reliability is the percentage of planes that leave within 15 minutes of the scheduled takeoff time , assuming no technical reasons for delay			1
the @entity1 has a dedicated " @entity65 " that helps assist with problems as they occur			0
" the center monitors every 787 in flight ; it identifies problems and works with the airline to provide maintenance , sometimes even in flight , " said @entity53			1

" because of the early dramatic grounding of the plane every little thing that happens now gets reported , " he told @entity0			0
" but the @entity1 has n't really become a total nightmare			0
new models do historically have a lot of teething problems			0
" the 747 had quite a few issues when it first entered service , and hairline cracks were also found in the wings of @entity92 ( along with other problems )			1
but none of this was a threat to the safe operation of the aircraft , which were repaired during downtime			0
" " these issues with the 787 are certainly frustrating for the airlines but you can be sure they are being well compensated			0
all the airlines i have spoken to think it 's a great plane with a fantastic future			0
" @entity2 said it was working with @entity1 to identify the issue with the engine			2
the plane would remain parked at @entity20 until the issue had been resolved , it added			1
