it 's difficult to fully understand things at the best of times and , occasionally , you 'll experience something that is unlike anything that you 've experienced thus far			1
one such example came early for me			1
during our regular family drives , my father would play a cassette from an old @entity15 radio program that he 'd first listened to as a kid growing up in the 1960s			1
the show was called " @entity26 " and it featured a couple of camp homosexual characters who went by the names of @entity23 -- played by @entity24 and @entity25			1
the pair were out - of - work actors who could be found running various fashionable and niche enterprises that always started with the word " bona " -- such as " @entity31			1
" the sketches usually began with a very middle - class @entity33 knocking on a shop door and asking " hello , anybody there ? " before @entity24 answered " ooh , hello ! i 'm @entity23 and this is my friend @entity38 ! " the audience loved them and their appearances became a highlight of the show thanks to a mixture of " @entity49 " language -- gay slang -- and ever more risque double entendres			1
perhaps their best - known sketch is when @entity33 is looking for legal representation and pops into a little shop called " @entity54			1
" @entity33 : " can you help me ? i 've erred			1
" @entity38 : " well , we 've all erred , ducky			2
i mean , it 's common knowledge , ennit , @entity61 ? " @entity33 : " will you take my case ? " @entity23 : " well , it depends on what it is			2
we 've got a criminal practice that takes up most of our time			2
" @entity33 : " yes , but apart from that , i need legal advice			2
" this was my first exposure to homosexuality and , because it was through humor , ably explained by my father , it meant that the only confusion around the subject came as i wondered why the kids in my school playground called each other " bender " or " queer			2
" as a 10 or 11 - year - old kid , you ask yourself very obvious and basic questions about the things that you 're unsure about			2
why are the kids calling each other these names when the kid in question is n't funny ? gays are funny , are n't they ? it was , of course , down to an ignorance brought about by a lack of exposure at my age			2
as you build up more encounters , so you build up a more complete picture of something			2
but the older i get , i do find myself continually amazed by the amount of people i meet who are still ignorant or underexposed to a whole range of things			2
it is n't necessarily their fault but it has a profound knock - on effect nonetheless			2
the fact is that there are millions of gay people all over the world and if you 're a fairly relaxed person like me , well , that 's just the way it is			1
i 'm not a religious fellow in any way whatsoever so , where homosexuality is concerned at least , @entity121 is not my barometer			2
then again , maybe i 'm the ignorant one			2
until i typed that last sentence , that thought had never occurred to me			0
for some people , it is a big deal and i only really came into contact with that once i became a footballer			0
up until then , my life had been fairly colorful , to say the least			0
in football , homosexual players remain scarce			1
there have been a couple of players who have " come out , " most recently @entity137 , the former @entity138 and @entity139 forward , who took to his website to announce that he was gay ... and promptly retired from the beautiful game at the tender age of 25			1
it was unfortunate for football and the gay community -- football is in desperate need of a gay icon -- yet was completely understandable			1
" they ( the players ) often do n't mean what they say , " @entity137 said			1
" it 's that pack mentality			0
they 're trying to get a laugh , they 're trying to be the top guy			0
it 's like high school again -- on steroids			0
" @entity137 was talking about a changing room that does n't know that it has a gay player in its midst			1
but i 'm as certain as i can be that a changing room that does know that it has a gay player in its ranks would be a very safe place for a gay footballer			1
that pack mentality works the other way , too			0
the group protects its own			0
it does n't matter whether you are white , black , straight or gay			1
i 'm as certain of that as i can be			0
sure , players will talk behind each other 's backs , not necessarily in a disparaging way , but -- to the outside world at least -- the team is a united front			1
there are no veils , curtains or walls in a changing room because every team has a player who will call a spade a spade			1
somebody who will point out that the king has no clothes on and , with one not - so - subtle comment , remove the awkwardness of almost any situation			0
the first time my roommate met the man at our club who has one hand , he said to him : " are you right - handed or left - handed ? " it was the ice - breaker everybody needed , especially for the man in question , who said that the worst thing about his disability is when people walk around him on eggshells			0
but it is difficult , if not impossible , for even the tightest of squads to protect a player from the taunts of tens of thousands of fans			1
or , for that matter , even just a few people			0
as recently as 2008 , a section of @entity220 fans sang the following words to @entity222 as he lined up for @entity223 against his former club : " @entity225 , @entity225 , wherever you may be not long now until lunacy and we wo n't give a f * * k when you 're hanging from a tree you 're a @entity232 c * * t with @entity233			0
" it 's easy to see why @entity137 gave the answer he did when a journalist asked him what he thought the reaction might be if he were to line up for @entity138 against , say , @entity239			1
" woah ! " @entity137 exclaimed			1
" i ca n't even think about that			0
" i can tell you now , it would be horrendous for him			0
you know as well as i do that the abuse a homosexual player would receive from " fans " throughout the land would be intolerable			1
that is n't to say that it would n't ease off , but would you want to be the player who goes first ? on @entity255 's south coast in @entity256 -- an area with a large gay community -- the football team and its fans take a fair amount of stick both during home matches and at away grounds			1
i 've heard " fans " singing to their counterparts : " who 's the f * * * * t in the pink ? " and once during a home match : " does your boyfriend know you 're here ? " -- which , i wo n't lie , made me smile because of the laughter it generated among the traveling @entity256 contingent			0
interestingly , there are few , if any , headlines written about it either as a social commentary or by a journalist going for a bit of sensationalism			0
however , @entity256 currently occupy a playoff berth in the championship and , should they win promotion to the @entity287 , i guarantee you that the headlines will begin in earnest next season -- something that will force the authorities to take a very public , zero - tolerating stance			0
perhaps that will turn out to be the first step on the ladder to a player " coming out			1
" @entity23 and @entity38 broke down many of the social barriers that existed in post-war @entity298 at a time when homosexuality was still illegal			0
it stands up because the writing is exceptional and the risque tone of it is expertly delivered on stage			0
@entity25 , in particular , seemed to go about his role with such relish that it almost sounded as if he 'd been freed from some terrible secret			0
many years later , after his death , his private diaries would reveal a man at tremendous odds with his own sexuality			0
imagine that ; imagine not being able to live out the true meaning of your life with the same freedom as most other people			0
imagine having to keep your true identity a secret			0
i would n't wish that on anybody .			0

homosexual players in football remain scarce with @entity137 the latest to come out and then retire
footballers protect their own but can not shield players from terrace abuse
abuse for a gay player even in 2013 would be " intolerable "
