@entity0 , @entity1 -- saying " there is no doubt who is responsible for this heinous use of chemical weapons attack in @entity1 : the @entity1 regime , " vice president @entity3 signaled tuesday that the @entity10 -- with its allies -- was ready to act			1
" those who use chemical weapons against defenseless men , women and children should and must be held accountable , " @entity3 said in a speech to the @entity13			1
the vice president 's remarks echo those made by other @entity10 officials in recent days , as well as many of the nation 's foremost allies			1
@entity26 president @entity25 said his administration was " ready to punish those who made the decision to gas these innocent people , " adding that " everything leads us to believe " that @entity1 president @entity31 's forces are responsible			1
@entity36 prime minister @entity35 -- who talked tuesday with @entity10 president @entity37 -- called lawmakers back from their summer vacations to consider a response to @entity1 , as the @entity36 military prepares contingency plans			1
and @entity10 defense secretary @entity43 told the @entity44 on tuesday that @entity10 forces are " ready to go " if ordered to strike @entity1 by president @entity37			1
" the options are there			0
the @entity50 is ready to carry out those options , " @entity49 said			0
@entity53 leaders were reacting to a growing consensus that the @entity1 regime was responsible for an august 21 attack that killed more than 1,300 people , most of them dying from exposure to toxic gases , according to rebel officials			1
the opposition -- which has said it 's been targeted by chemical weapons attacks in the past as well -- backed up its latest allegations with gruesome video of rows of dead bodies , including women and children , with no visible wounds			1
opinion : for @entity10 , @entity1 is truly a problem from hell @entity1 officials , though , have steadfastly denied using chemical weapons in this or other cases			1
foreign minister @entity78 said tuesday that his government would never use such munitions against its own people , daring those who disagree to present evidence publicly			1
he said rebel forces were to blame for security concerns near the suspected chemical sites , arguing that @entity53 leaders are using the claims as an excuse to go after @entity31 's regime			1
" we all hear the drums of war , " @entity78 said			0
" they want to attack @entity1			2
i believe to use chemical weapons as a pretext is not a right			0
" and if foreign powers do strike the @entity101 nation , its foreign minister said the government and its forces will fight back			2
" @entity1 is not easy to swallow , " said @entity78			2
" we have the materials to defend ourselves			0
" @entity107 inspectors in @entity1 , but what will they find ? the @entity107 has sent inspectors to @entity1 to try to get to the bottom of the wildly conflicting accounts of chemical warfare			2
the opposition says chemical payloads were among the ordnance fired into the rebel stronghold of @entity117			0
the government , via state tv reports , claims that its forces came into contact with toxic gas saturday in @entity123 , on the edge of @entity0 -- blaming this on " terrorists , " the term it commonly uses for rebel fighters			0
@entity2 could not independently confirm either account , including videos purported to show the aftermath of each			0
missile strikes on @entity1 likely response to chemical attack on monday , @entity107 inspectors visited the town of @entity139 , despite a close call with snipers that left one of their vehicles damaged and an explosion nearby			2
the inspectors had been expected tuesday to head to @entity117 , but that trip was pushed back a day " in order to improve preparedness and safety for the team			0
" @entity78 blamed rebel forces for failing to guarantee the @entity107 group 's safety and denying that its forces have delayed inspections by continually shelling @entity117			0
@entity156 posted tuesday to @entity157 purported to show the area being shelled , though @entity2 could not verify this video 's authenticity			0
yet @entity3 reiterated the claim that @entity1 forces were shelling the suspected chemical attack site			1
and @entity165 spokeswoman @entity164 said it may be too late for a valid inspection of what happened -- saying " too much time has passed " and accusing @entity31 's government of using the @entity107 investigation " as a stalling tactic or a charade to hide behind			0
" the @entity10 , meanwhile , is conducting its own investigation : an intelligence report detailing evidence of the alleged attack could be released as early as tuesday , a @entity10 official told @entity2			2
the report will include forensic evidence and intercepted communications among @entity1 military commanders , according to the official			2
the vice president said that beyond whatever inspectors do or do not find , common sense and the recent past point to one culprit			0
" the @entity1 regime are the only ones who have the weapons , have used chemical weapons multiple times in the past , have the means of delivering those weapons , have been determined to wipe out exactly the places that were attacked by chemical weapons , " he said tuesday			1
@entity198 leads international charge against strikes the calls for a military response were not without opposition			0
@entity198 is leading the charge internationally , with foreign minister @entity205 having said there is no proof yet @entity1 's government is behind last week 's chemical attack			1
his office compares the @entity53 allegations against @entity1 to claims @entity213 was hoarding weapons of mass destruction before the @entity10 invasion in 2003 -- allegations that fell apart once @entity10 troops began searching for them			1
intervening in @entity101 turmoil : mission impossible ? and tuesday , @entity198 's foreign ministry accused @entity223 of trying to " create artificial groundless excuses for military intervention			0
" @entity226 bemoaned the @entity10 postponement of a meeting that was scheduled for wednesday in @entity229 , where top diplomats from both countries had planned to discuss the war in @entity1			1
and @entity198 criticized the @entity10 for , in its view , trying to bypass the @entity234 to take action on the reported chemical attack			2
should anything be moved through the @entity107 council , @entity198 -- which has a permanent seat on it -- could block it			0
still , that 's what former @entity36 foreign secretary @entity241 urged world leaders to do before unleashing missiles or warplanes on @entity1 targets			1
@entity247 , @entity1 's information minister , on tuesday challenged the @entity10 to " present this proof to the rest of the world " -- claiming that they are asking for trouble if they do not			1
" if they do n't have proof or evidence , then how are they going to stand up to the @entity10 public opinion and to the world public opinion and explain why they are attacking @entity1 ? " @entity247 told @entity2 from @entity0			1
some worldwide have expressed concern that intervening in @entity1 may provoke broader conflict in the @entity101 or ensnare @entity53 powers in another bloody conflict after years of warfare in @entity213 and @entity267			2
@entity35 said that he understands those concerns , vowing that any action would have to be " proportionate , ... legal ( and ) would have to be specifically about deterring the use of chemical weapons			0
" still , he said it 's critically important that action be taken to show the international taboo against chemical weapons will not be tolerated			2
" this is not about wars in the @entity101 ; this is not even about the @entity1 conflict , " he said			2
" it 's about use of chemical weapons and making sure , as a world , we deter their use and we deter the appalling scenes we 've all seen on our television screens			0
