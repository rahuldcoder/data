a two - shot swing on the final hole of the final women 's major of the season saw @entity5 teenager @entity4 clinch a remarkable victory in the @entity7 at the expense of @entity9 of @entity10 sunday			1
@entity11 chasing an eighth career major , but first since 2006 , was one ahead going into the 18th hole , but took three shots from the edge of the green for a bogey five , missing her final effort from 12 feet			1
by contrast , the 19 - year - old @entity4 , playing her first major , showed no sign of nerves as he rolled home a 15 - foot birdie putt to finish on 11 - under 273			1
it left her a shot clear and the third youngest winner of a major behind @entity29 pair @entity28 and @entity30			1
speaking through an interpreter , @entity4 admitted : " i was flying like a bird			2
" @entity11 , who would have become the first player to win six different majors , with the @entity7 a recent addition to the roster , said she had misjudged her first effort from the edge of the green			2
" it was a rush of adrenaline with the belly wedge and the putt was faster than i thought			0
it was a very poor putt and i knew i had to make it for a play - off			0
" i had a lot of good shots and hit every green bar the second hole and it 's obviously disappointing , but i gave myself a good chance			2
" @entity4 , who stunned the golf world with her opening 10 - under 61 in @entity52 , closed with a final round of 68 to clinch the 350,000 - euro first prize ( $ 487,500 )			1
she has the added bonus of winning her full playing rights to next season 's @entity57 without having to qualify			0

to complete its domination , another @entity63 , was fifth on eight - under after a fine closing 67			0
@entity4 first came to attention at the 2012 @entity7 -- the last event before it became a major -- finishing fourth as an amateur that year			1
in 2013 she was @entity67 on the @entity68 and has already won three times this season			0
@entity29 star @entity71 had to pull out of the first round with a hand injury , but had some consolation by sealing the inaugural @entity75 ( @entity76 ) @entity77			0
