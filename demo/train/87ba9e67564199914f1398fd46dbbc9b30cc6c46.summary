-- @entity1 had been a little overweight since her teens , and , like many people , had spent the better part of her life trying different diets , whatever was popular at the time			1
having a child changed that , she says			0
after she had her baby , she decided to lose the post-baby weight and the extra pounds she 'd been carrying years before that			1
dropping about 70 pounds in seven months , @entity1 's maintained a healthy weight for almost four years now			1
name : @entity1 , 33 , an online interactive designer at @entity17 - @entity18 who lives in @entity19 , @entity20			1
background : she was a very normal child but her weight struggles began after puberty			1
she was probably 10 to 20 pounds over the weight she thinks fits well on her 5 - foot - 9 frame			1
it struck her hard because in her group of friends , she was one of the chubby ones			0
she started to yo - yo diet to try to fit in			1
after college she gained more weight , topping 200 pounds			1
she became what she calls a " serial dieter			0
" when she and her husband decided they wanted to have a child , it was a decision that changed her outlook on life and her self image			0
how much she lost : on june 30 , 2005 , she weighed 206.8 pounds			1
she reached her goal weight of 149 on january 19 , 2006			1
she eventually got to 135 pounds , but finds 145 to be a more comfortable weight			1
how she lost it : after her son was born in 2005 , @entity1 started to eat in a different way			1
" i found that when my focus changed from trying to get thin to trying to be healthy and a good example [ for my son ] , all of a sudden the weight started coming off , " she says			1
her preoccupation with her body image disappeared and she became more concerned with what were the best food choices she could make for her son			1
but just as important , she came to another realization			0
" i did n't have to be perfect , " she says about her plan to lose weight			2
before , she would hammer herself if she broke with the diet and had a doughnut or something else that made her feel like she had failed			2
" every choice i make is an on - plan choice			2
if i choose to eat a doughnut , that 's fine			0
i 'm going to eat that doughnut			0
it does n't mean i 'm off my diet			2
i 'll account for that in a later meal			0
or i 'll have a lighter dinner			0
" how she 's keeping it off : she 's maintained her weight for about four years			1
she credits her @entity72 account , where she enters what she eats like it 's a food journal			0
" it makes me stay conscious of what i am eating , " she says			2
she did keep up with her @entity78 points for two years , but felt a little restricted by tracking them			2
she always cooks dinner for her family and the leftovers become lunch for the next day			0
she also says she likes to bring snacks to work like soup , yogurt , apples and pudding cups			0
@entity90 : share your weight loss success story advice to others : if you just had a baby , do n't put any pressure on yourself to lose the weight , @entity1 says			1
instead , make a decision to eat healthier the moment you get home from the hospital			2
the goal should be to be conscious of what you eat and to not take the easy way out because you are frazzled or short on time			0
" a lot of women do n't think about themselves at that time ; it 's all about the new baby and it needs to be , " she says			0
" but if @entity114 's not feeling good and taking care of herself , then the child is not going to be happy either			0
" @entity1 believes the outside motivation of having a child made it easier for her to lose weight because she was also being healthful for her son			1
she also incorporated her son into her activities			2
one of the fun things she liked to do was to dance around the house with her child , getting down to everything from kid 's music to rock ' n ' roll to alternative music to hip - hop			0
" the little guy , " as she calls him , is going through a @entity132 phase , she says			0
she also blogs on a web site called greenlitebites.com where she shares recipes she and " the little guy " like to create .			0
