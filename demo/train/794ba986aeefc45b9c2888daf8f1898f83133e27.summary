-- pain , pain and more pain			0
@entity4 is an expert in discomfort			1
plagued by a chronic knee complaint , the 31 - year - old has had numerous epidural injections to soothe three swollen vertebrae and she suffers almost constant sciatica			1
not to mention the degenerative disc in her neck			0
these injuries are legacy of a death - defying decade in skeleton racing -- 10 years of hurling herself headfirst down an icy track in pursuit of golden glory has come at a cost			1
" i 'm pretty much broken between my back and my knees , " says the @entity22 , who won gold at the @entity24			1
" i got to the point where i was so blinkered and obsessed by winning a medal that i put all of the physical pain to one side			2
" after winning gold suddenly that pain that had been with me for years and years became too much			2
" i thought , ' that 's enough now			2
' " images : @entity37 torch leaves @entity38 nearly four years after that career - defining success , and despite physical complaints which would halt even the most relentless athlete , @entity4 is back in search of a new adrenaline rush as she pushes against the pain barrier			1
instead of being in a final buildup to february 's @entity46 in @entity47 , she 's now in the passenger seat of a @entity50 rally car , preparing for a new white - knuckle ride			1
@entity4 will co-drive for veteran compatriot @entity52 at this weekend 's final round of the @entity54 in @entity55			1
" i 've enjoyed getting in the car and the thrill you get from it , it 's definitely replaced something i 've lost since retiring from skeleton , " she told @entity0			1
" it 's physically not the same demands on your body , so that suits me			2
" rallying is a discipline in which competitors traverse public and private roads at breakneck speeds			0
while the driver is straining to keep the car on course , the co-driver navigates from point - to - point along a route littered with twists and turns			1
there are spectators in close proximity and the threat of a high - speed collision is never far away			2
" i 've surprised myself not being more nervous , " confessed @entity4			2
" certainly the skills i had in skeleton and being a world - class athlete has definitely transferred into the rallying			1
" @entity52 is a rally veteran who has enjoyed a career as a respected motorsport broadcaster and television pundit			2
it was tv which prompted him to contact @entity4 when the 61 - year - old saw her co-driving during an appearance on a @entity96 comedy show			1
not that her new role is one to be taken lightly			0
the co-driver , as well as being an unofficial team manager and timekeeper , is responsible for memorizing the route and relaying exact instructions			2
the driver must trust his partner implicitly			0
" i 've been thrown in at the deep end , " continued @entity4 , who only obtained her license to compete this weekend after completing a series of minor rallies across the @entity96			1
" it 's quite a mind - boggling amount of information i 'm being given each rally			1
so it 's been really tough , a lot tougher than i thought , physical and mentally			2
" i 've been very lucky that i 've not been anxious or worried or put off by the speed of the car , whereas i guess most people would be			0
" @entity52 has put a lot into me and you feel a pressure to perform			0
we 've given ourselves a big challenge to complete in @entity55			0
" compared to other divisions of motorsport such as @entity127 and @entity128 , rallying can appear lacking in glamor			0
think muddy puddles rather than perfectly preened pit girls			0
and while the likes of @entity127 champion @entity133 and @entity128 prodigy @entity134 bask in the limelight , rallying 's stars rarely occupy back - page column inches			2
this disparity irks @entity4 , especially when @entity54 boasts a champion as dominant as @entity140 -- the @entity141 master who has won the title in each of the last nine years			1
" rallying is not a sport you see on the back pages all of the time but they 're such skilled drivers , " she said			0
" the teamwork between the co-driver and the driver is incredible			0
i really admire that and i think it 's a shame it 's not out there as something everyone knows of			0
" skeleton is another sport which rarely commands media attention , but , between 2002 and 2010 , it demanded @entity4 ' complete concentration			1
and eight years after first attempting the event at a push - start facility in @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity4 was stood at the top of the podium			1
not that her journey was all smooth sliding			0
@entity4 missed out on a spot at the 2006 @entity46 in @entity170 to compatriot @entity171 , who went on to clinch a silver medal			1
four years of fierce dedication followed and the result was a gold medal for which her body is still paying the price			1
while she is pleased to be heading to @entity178 's first @entity46 as a broadcaster , @entity4 fully expects to feel pangs of regret once the @entity37 cauldron is officially lit. " emotionally i might find going to @entity47 very tough , " she said			1
" there is still a big part of me that would love to compete			0
i still feel that i could definitely get another @entity37 medal , but i had to listen to what my body was telling me			0
" i listened to the sports doctors and they were telling me to retire years ago			0
so that 's why i 've stopped			0
" so for now , rallying has sated @entity4 ' competitive appetite			2
in the future , however , she might have to take to the high seas to quench her thirst for adventure			0
" i 've agreed to try to break the record for going around the world in a @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , " said @entity4			1
ribs are most commonly used a rescue vessels and military boats			0
" we 've got a lot of money to raise by the end of this year			0
if we get the correct amount of money , we 'll be setting sail in spring 2015			0
" after conquering ice and land , mastering the world 's oceans would complete an impressive hat - trick for @entity4 .			1
