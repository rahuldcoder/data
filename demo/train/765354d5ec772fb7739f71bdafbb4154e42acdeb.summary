-- it 's a snapshot meant to shock : a bloodied woman hunched over with this caption underneath , " my mother knew i 'd never hurt her , then she got in the way			2
" graphic ads about the dangers of meth addiction are trying to tackle what 's a top drug problem in small towns			1
the @entity13 has made a name for itself with graphic , disturbing print and broadcast ads meant to wake up kids to the dangers of methamphetamine addiction			1
another ad shows a filthy urinal with the caption , " no one thinks they 'll lose their virginity here			2
" the nonprofit organization said it 's baring the ugly truth about what the @entity30 calls the most dangerous drug problem of small - town @entity33			1
now the @entity13 is targeting a new audience : the growing population of @entity38 - speaking teens in the @entity39			1
it 's releasing television commercials in @entity38 in @entity41 and radio ads throughout the @entity39 featuring young @entity44 addicts sharing real - life meth nightmares			1
nothing is lost in translation			2
in @entity50 , one of the @entity38 radio voices belongs to recovering addict @entity51			1
in his ad , @entity53 said he first tried meth at 15 and headed on a downward spiral , adding : " i think it affected my brain			1
i have bad thoughts and i only want to do bad things , such as hurt people			2
i think i am going crazy			0
" @entity53 said meth deadened his conscience , emboldened him and kept him up all night with an edgy high			1
@entity64 made it easier , he said , to become sucked into a world of crime and gangs			1
@entity53 remembers beating up and robbing people just walking down the street and taking part in drive - by shootings , including one in which " i shot 17 shots into the house and then i walked around the block and back into the car and just left			0
" @entity64 made him feel " big and bad , " said @entity53 , who never imagined being locked up			1
he 's serving time at the @entity78 in @entity50 for grand theft , possession of a weapon by a minor , and drug possession			0
@entity53 ' drug rehabilitation counselor , @entity85 , said that up to 40 percent of juveniles in the @entity78 facility have a history of meth addiction			1
she said meth takes over their lives			1
" it starts to destroy their value system			0
it eats away at every aspect of their life : family , responsibility to community , responsibility to education , responsibility to themselves even , " @entity85 said			0
" it just eats away at all that until they have no value system left , that the only thing they 're doing is seeking for that high			0
" @entity85 supports the @entity13 's @entity38 ad campaign because , she said , denial of the problem extends to teenagers and parents in all populations -- including @entity117			1
she said she thinks outreach needs to be better tailored for the growing @entity44 community in @entity50			0
@entity85 also counsels @entity120 , a recovering meth addict who served time for robbery and was released recently from the juvenile detention center			1
" when i was coming down from meth , i would feel bad			2
you know , i threw up and i could n't eat			0
even if i was hungry , i could n't eat , " @entity120 said			0
" you know , i would just stay in my room and not talk to anyone , because they would make me mad when they talked to me			2
" while on meth , @entity120 said , he also developed frightening ulcerlike sores on his body and suffered from an erratic heartbeat			2
still , he said , his cravings for the drug persist and he knows staying clean wo n't be easy			2
he 's gotten a job at a fast - food restaurant , is reconnecting with his family and has recorded a @entity38 radio ad for the @entity13			1
@entity120 said he hopes to reach young @entity117 who are n't getting the message about meth in @entity142			1
" they might understand a little bit of it or half of it , " he said			0
" but if they hear it ... in their own language ... the way they were born and they were raised , you know , speaking @entity38 , then maybe they will pay a little more attention to it and maybe think about it , instead of doing it			1
" @entity160 volunteer @entity159 agrees , saying that " in the @entity163 community , there 's just a lack of education , a lack of treatment and resources , there 's a lack of support , because there are some communication gaps			0
" @entity159 , also a recovering meth addict , speaks in classrooms throughout @entity50 and at community events			2
he said he thinks the graphic nature of the ads is needed to drive home the dangers of meth			1
" i 've seen people lose everything , you know , from their toes to the top of the head , either through death or maybe it 's the sores or the scabs [ affecting ] the teeth or the eyes , " he said			0
" the list is endless			0
" drug officials say meth -- also known as chalk , crank , crystal , glass , ice or speed -- has been a major threat in rural @entity33 because it is cheap and easy to make			1
traffickers mix drugs bought over the counter with common ingredients , according to the @entity30			0
twelve - to 14 - year - olds who live in small towns are more than twice as likely to use meth than those who live in larger cities , the agency said			2
the @entity13 began in 2005 in what was then the heartland of meth : @entity216			1
government leaders there credit the effort with large declines in meth use , including a 45 percent drop in teen use since its ads first appeared			1
the ad campaign has since spread to a half - dozen other states , including @entity41 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity50 , @entity229 and @entity230			0
program organizers said they research and tailor their campaigns for each new state			0
but not everyone is convinced of the program 's effectiveness			0
@entity237 , a researcher and critic of the @entity13 , said : " there is the potential for boomerang effects with these ads. some teenagers react negatively to graphic advertising			1
these people do n't like ' being told how to behave ' by the ads and may rebel against them			2
" the @entity13 is funded through private donations and receives millions of dollars in federal and state grants			1
@entity237 said he thinks those dollars could be put to better use			0
as for the @entity38 ad campaign , he said : " i prefer the radio ads to the print and television ads. they 're not so over the top			1
i like that the radio ads feature real former users rather than actors			1
this makes them seem more realistic			0
a problem is still that they do n't provide any information about how to quit or avoid using meth			2
teenagers need practical skills and information			0
" the @entity38 ad campaign in @entity50 is too new for analysis of widespread impact			1
organizers said they hope for more reactions such as that of high school student @entity275			0
@entity275 , who moved to @entity50 from @entity276 , said she and her parents have been listening to the radio ads together			2
" my parents , we did n't see a lot of drugs during my time in @entity276			0
so we did n't know what the drugs are and what they do , " she said			0
" so what my parents would do , like when they would listen to the radio , they were like , ' oh , you should listen to this , because this is what i want you to learn			0
' " @entity275 said she was prepared when peers offered her meth			2
" they were like , ' oh , you should do this , so that way you could be a little bit cooler or you 're with us			0
you need to do this			0
' i 'm like , no ... you know , cause i 'd heard about it			0
