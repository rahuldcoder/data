the @entity3 administration is thinking about sending additional military advisers to @entity5 as it ramps up efforts to consider how to get thousands of @entity7 off @entity8 and how to boost the capabilities of @entity12 @entity11 fighters in northern @entity5 , a @entity1 official said tuesday			1
the official did not want to be named because no decisions have been made yet			0
but consideration is being given to sending as many as 75 additional @entity1 military personnel to @entity5 , a second @entity1 military official told @entity17			1
president @entity3 had previously authorized sending as many as 300 advisers to that country			0
currently , 250 @entity1 military personnel are in @entity5 and are directly involved in the already - approved mission of running two joint operations centers and assessing the capabilities of @entity5 forces			1
however , the first @entity1 official said , their job is expanding to consider evacuation options and the needs of the @entity11			1
with a new mission , it is expected the @entity30 could make a new @entity32 notification to @entity33 to send additional personnel outside the 300 - person limit for the new short duration task of assessing the @entity11 and developing options for evacuations			2
@entity3 said the @entity1 is looking for ways the international community can band together to rescue those who have been stranded by the fighting			1
" the next step , which is going to be complicated logistically , is how do we give safe passage for people down from the mountain , and where can we ultimately relocate them so that they are safe			0
that 's the kind of coordination that we need to do internationally , " @entity3 said on saturday			0
@entity51 officials said one of the first steps is getting a clearer picture of how many people are still stranded , so planning for evacuation options can begin			1
" we 're currently assessing what we can and ca n't do and trying to understand , for example , the numbers that are on the mountain itself			0
i 've seen reports of numbers in the thousands , and i 've seen reports in the numbers of tens of thousands , " lt. gen. @entity64 , director of operations on the @entity65 , told reporters monday			0
one @entity1 defense official said that while some people have escaped through humanitarian corridors , the @entity1 believes anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 people potentially could still be on the mountain , although the actual number is not known			2
with those numbers , any operation , whether by air or land , could take weeks			0
all of the officials @entity17 has spoken to say the administration has ruled out putting @entity1 troops on the ground , but some rescue options -- for example , using helicopters -- could involve a brief @entity1 ground presence			1
@entity1 officials do believe that any rescue option , such as @entity11 forces going in , or the establishment of additional safe passage corridors on the ground , still require a heavy @entity1 air combat presence to suppress @entity99 militants from attacking			2
on monday , @entity1 fighter jets attacked several @entity99 positions near @entity103 , including checkpoints , which is part of the effort to begin to push them back , the @entity1 official said			2
@entity12 @entity11 fighters have requested additional arms supplies from the @entity1 , the first @entity1 official noted			0
if additional @entity1 advisers are sent , part of the their expanded role will be to assess the capabilities of the @entity11 and see what else is needed beyond the resupply of ammunition			1
@entity64 hinted at this monday as well , telling reporters that some of the militant forces have longer - range weapons systems " so we need to make sure that the government of @entity5 and the @entity5 security forces are providing longer - range weapons themselves to the @entity12 forces			0

the @entity1 may send more military advisers to @entity5
the @entity1 advisers already there will consider evacuation options
the @entity1 is helping in the rescue of @entity7 on @entity8
