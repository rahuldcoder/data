-- @entity1 has not only declared himself fit to play at this week 's @entity2 , after playing nine holes of practice at @entity5 on wednesday , but he 's also eying a fifth title			1
since he withdrew from the @entity8 on sunday after jarring his troublesome back , @entity1 ' participation had dominated the buildup to the final major of the year			1
however , the 38 - year - old 's physiotherapist fixed a problem that had looked set to rule him out , after @entity1 dislocated his sacrum -- a bone at the base of his spine -- when landing in a bunker			0
" i felt good once the bone was put back in , " the former number one told reporters on wednesday evening			1
" i 'm not in any pain			0
" " once he put it back in , the spasms went away and from there i started getting some range of motion			0
" the inflammation has been down , i have range of motion , my speed and power -- and i just need to keep it up			0
" leaderboard : @entity2 @entity34 ' participation had been in serious doubt prior to his practice round , after he struggled to tie his shoes on sunday because of pain			1
yet there was better still for @entity1 ' legion of fans as he responded to the question of whether he could win in @entity45 with a resounding ' yes '			0
" ( to ) try to go out there and win this event , that 's all i 'm focused on , " said @entity1 , who won the @entity2 the last time it was held at @entity5 in 2000			1
following surgery to treat a trapped nerve in his back in march , a three - month layoff forced the @entity54 to miss both the masters -- for the first time in his career -- and the @entity58			0
his back problems appeared to have been put behind him until the weekend flare - up in @entity61 , only the third @entity63 event he had contested since the operation			1
however , @entity1 says sunday 's injury was unrelated to the operation earlier this year			2
" it was a different pain to what i had been experiencing so i know it was not the site of the surgery , " he explained			0
@entity34 ' confidence about any potential victory flies in the face of his recent performances in the majors , having failed to win any of the last 19 he has contested			1
in his last appearance at july 's @entity78 , he finished 69th -- a performance that would have been unimaginable prior to the decline in his game following the well - documented marital problems he suffered in 2009			2
trailing the all - time record held by @entity84 , 14 - time major winner @entity1 needs to prove his form and fitness this week to have a hope of making @entity89 's team for next month 's @entity90 against @entity91 in @entity92			2
while keeping a close eye on @entity1 ' practice round , the veteran @entity89 also named @entity95 as one his @entity90 vice-captains on wednesday -- with the 47 - year - old joining @entity98 and @entity99 as an assistant			0
@entity34 ' form this season barely reflects the feverish speculation over his fitness , since his best finish from the seven tournaments he has contested worldwide is a lowly 25th			2
should he suffer no further problems , @entity1 will partner former champions @entity107 and @entity109 when he tees off on thursday			2
he is chasing his fifth title after winning the event in 1999 , 2000 , 2006 and 2007			0
@entity2 breaks with tradition in a separate development on wednesday , @entity2 organizers announced that the 2016 edition of the competition will be held in july			0
the event is traditionally held in august but with golf featuring at that year 's @entity119 for the first time since 1904 , with the @entity121 running between august 5 - 21 , the @entity2 has been forced into a change			1
the tournament scheduled for @entity124 in @entity125 will now take place on july 28 - 31			0
" it 's a condensed schedule , " @entity2 chief executive officer @entity127 told reporters at @entity5			1
" obviously with the @entity119 , it 's also a @entity90 year , you throw in the ( @entity2 playoffs ) , so it 's a very congested schedule			1
