-- @entity1 put a turbulent few months behind them by sweeping aside @entity2 3 - 0 at the @entity3 in their opening game of the @entity6 season			1
@entity7 was the standout player as he scored twice and @entity1 dominated despite having @entity8 sent off and playing the whole of the second half with ten men			1
the omens initially were not good for @entity1			2
the club ended last season empty handed under @entity14			0
the club 's president @entity15 had to resign over alleged irregularities surrounding the @entity19 transfer			0
and star striker @entity7 has been embroiled in allegations of tax avoidance			2
black cat = bad luck ? but , more importantly , a black cat somehow found itself in the stadium a minute after kick off and delayed the match			1
it evaded several tackles before nonchalantly walking off the pitch on its own terms			2
a steward managed to grab the cat as it attempted to enter the stands and received several scratches for his troubles			2
@entity7 , perhaps taking a leaf out of the feline invader 's playbook , evaded several challenges of his own to fire @entity1 ahead before half time			1
but a few minutes later @entity1 were down to ten men when @entity8 brought down @entity2 striker @entity43			1
he was the last defender and , deservedly , received a straight red card			0
but you would n't have known that it was @entity1 down to ten men given their second half performance			1
they enjoyed 79 per cent of possession as @entity7 added a second			2
there was also a goal for 18 year old @entity54 graduate @entity53			0
the whereabouts of the black cat is currently unknown			1
the underdog 's underdog meanwhile arguably one of the biggest underdogs in the history of top level @entity6 football started life in @entity65 with a shock victory			0
a few months ago it was n't even clear whether @entity68 -- a club from a @entity70 town of just 28,000 people which had never played in the top tier of @entity6 football before -- would even be allowed to play			1
the club appeared to fall foul of some idiosyncratic financial rules			0
despite being self - sustaining and completely free of debt -- unlike a host of other @entity6 clubs -- @entity80 faced the prospect of relegation to @entity6 football 's third tier			0
idiosyncratic a 1999 decree requires every team to have a capital equal to 25 per cent of the average expenses of all sides in the second division , excluding the two clubs with the biggest outgoings and the two with the smallest			0
it meant @entity80 had to raise â ‚ ¬ 1.7 million ( $ 2.3 million ) if they wanted to play in the top division			0
but a social media campaign allowed the club to raise the necessary cash to compete , a campaign that @entity70 rivals @entity100 probably wish had failed			0
the two met in a @entity70 derby on the first day of the season , but it was @entity80 that snatched a historic 1 - 0 victory thanks to @entity108 's first half free kick .			1

@entity1 stormed to an easy 3 - 0 **win** against @entity2
black cat invades pitch before game , but does n't bring bad luck
@entity1 *reduced* to 10 men , but @entity7 shines
*minnows* @entity68 **win** first game
