police suspect the gunmen targeted @entity12 , a member of the ruling @entity20			1

some of the victims were shot to death after they were kidnapped , @entity18 told @entity2			0

the @entity20 , led by president @entity38 , views @entity9 as a crucial political battleground , but politics in @entity1 's economic hub are dominated by the @entity34 , which represents " muhajirs , " descendants of immigrants from @entity45 decades ago			1
the @entity37 is a secular @entity46 party based in militant - plagued northwest @entity1 , whose supporters have migrated south to @entity9 because of the violence in their home region			2
