-- @entity0 hero @entity1 is ramping up his efforts to build mortgage - free homes for @entity6 troops wounded in @entity7 and @entity8			1
his group , @entity9 , has built 17 houses to date , and 19 more are under construction			2
just this month , the organization broke ground on its first home for a military widow			1
@entity0 's @entity16 spoke with @entity1 , one of the top 10 @entity17 of 2010 , about the unique way he and his group surprised the widow			1
they also talked about a new film that reveals the hurdles @entity1 faced as the child of an alcoholic			1
" @entity32 in the @entity33 , " starring @entity34 and @entity35 , is a true story about the struggles and ultimate redemption of @entity1 's father , who has donated millions of dollars toward scholarships in @entity31			1
below are excerpts from the interview			2
@entity16 : @entity38 , a widow from @entity39 , @entity31 , did n't know that you had selected her to receive a home			1
how did you surprise her with the news ? @entity1 : we surprised her during halftime at a @entity46 game			1
we got there and we started talking to her , and she 's telling us about her husband and how big of fans they were			1
he was buried in his dress blues , but underneath his dress blues he was buried in ( wide receiver ) @entity57 's jersey			1
we did n't even know it , and the @entity46 had no clue			2
that must have made it that much more special			2
what was the moment of surprise like ? @entity65 : she just broke down , and it just tore me out			2
tears just started flowing from everybody			1
i tell you , it was amazing			2
when we gave the home away , you could hear a pin drop in the stadium			2
and afterward , i knew several people all around in the stadium in different places , and they called me ( and said ) everybody was crying			2
so that was really a neat , neat deal			2
see video of the moment she had just lost @entity87 a couple weeks before we gave her the home			2
and it was just so emotional because she was just trying to get her life together			2
... we broke ground on the house , and it 's moving right along			1
@entity16 : i understand you also have a home delivery planned for @entity97 weekend ? @entity65 : it is for @entity99			2
he 's a double amputee			1
he 's just a great young man			1
he 's married , got one little boy			1
i tell you this guy 's amazing			1
he does n't let anything hold him back			0
when he was in service , he had bought some property in @entity110 and he was planning on building a home there			0
but it was becoming harder and harder because of his disability			0
so we came along and surprised him			0
he already had his ( architectural ) plans , so we 're building his dream home			0
@entity16 : what are some of the challenges you 'll face as your organization expands this year ? @entity65 : we 're looking at doubling ( the number of homes ) by the end of this year			1
it looks like we 're on track			0
but we 're still looking for monetary contributions and also materials			0
we 've developed new relationships with ( a flooring company ) this year ; they furnish all the flooring , wood , tile , carpet and things like that for all our homes			1
these relationships make it easier and easier for us to put these homes together			1
@entity16 : philanthropy is in your family , and that 's part of what the film " @entity148 " touches upon			1
what did you get from your dad when it comes to giving back ? @entity65 : i guess it 's just the spirit of , once you reach your goals or ... once you are blessed with certain things , you 're ( not ) supposed to hold on to it			1
i think @entity159 gives you things to help others			0
@entity16 : still , the film focuses on some difficult issues			0
how have you seen it affect audiences ? @entity65 : the movie touches so many lives because the movie is about our family , but mostly about @entity171 and his struggle with alcoholism			0
he quit drinking and became successful and started giving back			1
but along that path , you have children of alcoholics -- myself , my sisters and brothers -- and what they go through			0
then you have a spouse of an alcoholic and what she goes through dealing with the alcoholism			0
then you have the alcoholic himself ; you see what struggles he has to overcome , that demon			0
and then at the same time , i had a sister ( who ) , when she was 30 and had a 2 - year - old son , died of cancer			1
and so this is all in the movie			0
i 've had so many people come up to me , and they had a sister or brother or someone die of cancer and the movie affected them because they were thinking of that			0
people come up to me that were children of alcoholics and say : " hey , that was my life except for the getting rich part			0
the bad part -- that was my part			0
" so it really affects a lot of people			0
... usually when you have abuse and alcoholism and things like that , it passes from one generation to another			0
but in our family it did n't			0
and i 'm so proud of my brother and sisters that that did n't go on			0
@entity16 : what do you hope people will take away from the film ? @entity65 : when i was in the position , i just did n't think there was any hope			0
... i just want them to realize -- the kids that see this movie and they have parents like that -- ( that ) if they can just have faith in @entity159 and just keep doing the right things and hang in there , that everything can be ok			0
and just because you start out life that way does n't mean you have to end life that way			0
@entity16 : you are evidence of that			0
has @entity9 become what you 'd hoped ? @entity65 : yes , it really has			0
i guess when we first started , i had no idea that we 'd be where we 're at today			1
as we grow , i can see where our goal of building 100 homes every year is getting closer and closer			1
i think we 're about three years away from hitting that goal , maybe less			1
there are just so many of those young families out there that need our help , and we 're going as fast as we can .			2
