@entity0 -- as news of his admission and apology reverberated tuesday throughout the country and in the halls of @entity8 , those who hold rep. @entity11 's political future in their hands debated whether the scandal will be his downfall			1
some voters in @entity11 's district said he should " never resign , " while others called for his immediate ouster			1
while @entity11 -- first elected to @entity8 in 1998 -- has generally enjoyed strong backing in @entity0 's @entity23 , his confession monday that he has sent lewd photos of himself to women , had inappropriate relationships , and lied to the media unleashed a series of questions about his political future			1
what do you think about rep. @entity11 's confession ? " it 's scary that , you know , a political person that we elected would be able to do something like that , " said @entity33 , a voter in @entity11 's @entity0 district			1
" he should resign , " said fellow voter @entity42			2
@entity11 has said he will not give up his seat			1
perhaps @entity11 's troubles are best summarized by a handwritten note posted outside his district office in @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity0 : " resign , @entity49			1
" @entity50 , 82 , has lived in @entity47 for 50 years			0
when asked tuesday whether @entity11 should resign , the lifelong @entity51 -- who campaigned for him -- said , " yes			1
i definitely wo n't vote for him , i think of him as a different person			2
" " he betrayed his wife , " @entity50 added			0
" you have to think before you make a mistake			0
" others took the opposite position			0
" actually , i 'm glad he 's not resigning , " @entity59 said			2
" what he does on his personal time is his business			2
" @entity64 , a registered @entity65 who has lived in the district 40 years , said @entity11 should " definitely not " resign			1
" he 's a human being , " @entity64 said			0
" he made a mistake			0
" " i think he 's one of the most effective , decent congressman out there , " said @entity48 native @entity69			0
@entity11 's behavior was " stupid , " @entity69 said , but not something to resign over			1
he also said , " i find it ridiculous that that would be the news " when so much else is going on in the world			0
@entity80 minority leader @entity79 announced that she would call for an ethics committee investigation " to determine whether any official resources were used or any other violation of @entity80 rules occurred			0
" @entity11 insists no government resources were used			1
he issued a statement saying he would " welcome and fully cooperate " with the probe , which other @entity89 leaders also rallied behind			0
senate majority leader @entity90 , when asked about the controversy tuesday , said , " i 've known congressman @entity11			1
i wish there was some way i could defend him , but i ca n't			1
" later , when asked what he would do if @entity11 called him for advice , @entity90 replied , " i 'd tell him to call someone else			1
" if @entity11 were to resign or be compelled to leave office , @entity0 gov. @entity99 , also a @entity51 , would determine the timing of a special election to replace him			1
whether or not he holds onto his congressional seat , many analysts believe he will pay a tremendous political price : losing his spot as a frontrunner in @entity0 's 2013 mayoral election			0
" he would have had my vote			0
not now , " said @entity110 , 55 , a retired school custodian			0
@entity110 also said @entity11 should resign from @entity8 " because of the way he disgraced his family			1
" @entity0 mayor @entity114 said tuesday , " it 's hard to believe , given the coverage that all of the press has given this situation , that any voters in his district are n't familiar with the situation , what happened , whatever , and they will have an opportunity to express themselves in one year and four months from now			1
in the meantime , you know , i keep saying , this country has lots of very big problems that maybe we should all focus on and @entity8 should certainly get back to work and focus on			1
" @entity133 have jumped on the situation , targeting democrats who have accepted financial donations from @entity11 over the years			1
the @entity138 sent out news releases focusing on at least 18 districts across the country , asking whether @entity89 lawmakers will " return embattled congressman @entity11 's tainted cash			1
" the news releases do n't suggest @entity11 collected money inappropriately , but they refer to him as " ethically troubled " and call on the lawmakers to return his money and " condemn @entity11 's outrageous behavior			1
" one focusing on rep. @entity149 , @entity150 , notes that he has received a total of $ 3,000 from @entity49 in the past			1
@entity11 's admission monday came a week after he claimed a hacker had posted a lewd photo to his @entity157 account			1
speaking at a news conference monday , he said he had carried on inappropriate relationships with several women he had met online			0
@entity11 said he is not planning on separating from his wife , @entity161 , a longtime aide to secretary of state @entity162			2
he said he took " full responsibility " for his actions -- both the relationships and for lying about sending the photo last month of his bulging underwear on his @entity157 account			0
" to be clear , the picture was of me , and i sent it			0
i 'm deeply sorry for the pain this has caused my wife , and our family , my constituents , my friends , my supporters and my staff , " he said , claiming he meant to send the photo as a direct message -- which is private -- as a " joke " and then " panicked " after he realized he had tweeted it , which anyone can see			0
" i lied because i was ashamed at what i had done , and i did n't want to get caught , " he said			0
an emotional @entity11 described his actions as " dumb , " " destructive " and " deeply , deeply hurtful " -- both for his admitted cover - up and for repeatedly engaging in " inappropriate conversations conducted over @entity157 , @entity187 , e-mail and occasionally on the phone " with women he 'd met online , mostly via @entity187			2
the congressman claimed that he never met any of the women in person , and that his wife learned he 'd been lying about the @entity157 picture on monday morning			0
the admission came hours after images were published on @entity199 , a conservative website run by @entity201 , that apparently show @entity11 shirtless			2
" i have made terrible mistakes , " @entity11 told reporters			2
" i have not been honest with myself or my family			0
... i should not have done this , and i should not have done this particularly when i was married			0
" @entity11 said he " exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years			2
" some of those relationships began before his 2010 marriage ; some continued -- and others began -- afterward , he said			0
during his news conference , @entity11 apologized " to everyone that i misled in the media " -- including @entity201 -- but most of all to his wife			2
" this was me doing a dumb thing , and doing it repeatedly , then lying about it , " @entity11 said			2
@entity201 's website was the first to publish an incriminating photo , sent may 27 via @entity157 from @entity11 's account of a man in his underwear			1
@entity11 initially released written statements claiming that he was the victim of a hacker and a prank			2
then , during a testy press conference , he dodged questions about whether the photo was of him and why he had n't asked law enforcement to investigate if his account had been compromised			0
the following day , in a series of interviews , he said he could not say with " certitude " if the photograph was of him			0
he also deflected recent questions from @entity1 , saying he had hired an attorney at the firm of @entity241 to look into the matter			0
the woman who received the @entity157 photo in late may , @entity245 , denied on her own account that she was one of the women with whom @entity11 admitted having an " inappropriate relationship			2
" @entity249 reports that @entity250 , a 26 - year - old single mother from @entity252 , provided them with dozens of photos , e-mails , facebook messages and cell phone call logs related to her relationship with @entity11			2
in a posting on @entity199 , @entity259 said she was a @entity261 veteran and full - time college student who , on april 20 , went to @entity11 's @entity187 page and commented that the congressman was " hot " on one of his videos			1
she said the two began corresponding " within an hour , " adding that she did n't know if he is a " horrible person " but decided to speak out after hearing he 'd " hired an investigative firm to go through all of his files			0
" many @entity89 first rallied around the liberal congressman			0
but members of the @entity80 @entity89 leadership have talked repeatedly in recent days to try to get him to end what has become , to them , an unwelcome political distraction , a member of the party 's leadership told @entity1 before @entity11 's press conference monday			1
" it 's frustrating because we 'll talk to him and say clean it up , and then he goes out and does stuff , " said the member of the @entity80 @entity89 leadership , who declined to speak on the record about private discussions with @entity11			1
" he 's got to put the period at the end of the sentence , " the @entity89 source said before @entity11 's confession			1
" @entity1 's @entity296 , @entity297 , and @entity298 contributed to this report .			0
