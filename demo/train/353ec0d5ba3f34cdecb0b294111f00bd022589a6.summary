-- an @entity2 family is in shock after receiving an anonymous letter -- purportedly from a neighbor -- imploring them to euthanize their autistic son or move out of the neighborhood because of the " nuisance " the teen poses to the community			1
" that noise he makes when he is outside is dreadful ! its ( sic ) scares the hell out of my normal children ! ! ! ! ! " said the letter aimed at 13 - year - old @entity16			1
" they should take whatever non retarded body parts he possesses and donate it to science			0
" the letter , signed " one pissed off mother , " told the family to " go live in a trailer in the woods with your wild animal kid " and to " ( do ) the right thing and move or euthanize him ! " " either way we are all better off			2
" " @entity38 " is the word @entity16 's father , @entity36 , said comes to mind when he thinks about the letter			1
" i can not believe that someone would think that in this day and age			0
" @entity16 said the letter was delivered to @entity16 's grandmother 's house , about 15 minutes from the @entity16 home in @entity47 , a town 40 miles from @entity48			1
" i work and my wife has ( multiple sclerosis ) , " @entity16 said			0
" so @entity16 's grandmother helps us out a lot			1
he is over there three to four times a week			0
" @entity56 said the incident is being investigated , and police have asked the @entity59 whether the letter constitutes a crime			1
crime or not , @entity16 is concerned			2
" if someone is sick enough to not only have those thoughts , but to write those thoughts out and then to mail them " he said , then " they should be considered dangerous			0
" despite the " one bad apple " as @entity16 described the letter 's author , his spirit has been buoyed by others who have rallied around @entity72 " the neighbors have been wonderful " he said			2
@entity16 is going into the eighth grade this year and his dad said he is not aware exactly of what has happened , " but he sure is getting a kick out of all of the attention			0
