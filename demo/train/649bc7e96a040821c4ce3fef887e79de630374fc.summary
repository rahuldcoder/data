@entity0 , @entity1 -- the plastic ziploc bag thrown in the trash in @entity0 , @entity1 , spent a week traveling 300 miles to an @entity6 landfill			1
the old @entity7 that was recycled is a month into its journey			0
and a pair of worn @entity11 running shoes is still logging miles even after being dropped in a bin for used shoes			2
those are just some of the trails of trash exposed in a high - tech trash study			1
" normally , you think about the trash for minutes while you take it out to the can , " says @entity23 , " and this trash we are going to be watching on our web browsers for weeks			2
" @entity23 and @entity27 are volunteers in a study tracking their trash -- and giving them the opportunity to reflect on what they use and discard			1
the tracking devices are about the size of small cell phones and allow for near - real - time tracking of thousands of pieces of garbage			1
the tracking is not part of some top - secret government program to spy on garbage , but rather the brainchild of @entity46 researchers who wanted to learn if society could more efficiently dispose of what it throws out			1
" the idea with this tagging exercise is to bring an invisible system to life , " said @entity49 , associate director of @entity46 's @entity50 " by knowing how long it stays in the system , where it goes , we are hoping to create an increased awareness in the public			1
" before that increased awareness could be created , however , the scientists needed to devise a way to track pieces of trash , some for hundreds of miles and for up to six months			1
researchers are doing most of the tracking via volunteers in @entity0			2
they plan to expand the program to other cities and compare the attitudes that people in different regions have about garbage			1
working with the telecommunications company @entity78 , the @entity46 researchers created a device -- or , as the researchers call them , " traces " -- that could track a piece of trash using both gps and cell phone towers			1
the researchers then asked volunteers to supply items they were already planning to get rid of and put the tracking " traces " on the items			0
the volunteers then threw the material out as they usually would			0
just getting the trace on the piece of trash presented its own challenges			0
some needed to be taped or sewn into the garbage ; others were stuck to the trash with a sticky aerosol spray			2
the researchers stipulated that the trace not alter how the garbage traveled through the waste system or call attention to the item			1
" the thing about trash is that each object is very different , " @entity49 said			0
" different sizes , different textures , different constraints			0
" @entity23 and @entity27 live on a houseboat , where space is at a premium			0
participating in the study has allowed the couple to think of larger - picture issues about the trash they produce			1
but it 's not just the trash 's owners who are tracking the tems			0
@entity123 , a waste removal and recycling company , is helping fund the study in the hope that it will show that the trash they dispose of goes where it should			1
officials say they are also looking for ways to better deal with garbage			0
" it could make a huge difference , " @entity123 spokeswoman @entity133 said			0
" we want to do everything we can to get our materials to their destinations as efficiently as possible ; not only because of the economic cost , but also because of the environmental cost			0
there 's no point in hauling material around in circles			0
" researchers are still compiling data as the trash makes its journey			2
even though the study has not been completed , the @entity46 group sees its efforts as a step toward better informing @entity154 about trash			1
" can we create a situation of minimum waste ? " @entity49 said			1
" in a certain way , it 's about telling people about what they throw away , making people more aware about waste , and perhaps changing their behavior			2
" participating in the study has already altered @entity23 's outlook			0
" the disposal is one part of it , the using is another , " he said			0
" no one 's saying we are bad people for using stuff , but the reality is each one of us gets one - six - billionth of what the @entity174 can produce , and what we have is much more than that			2

trash study tracks how pieces of garbage may travel hundreds of miles
@entity46 researchers hope study will help people better understand *impact* of garbage they produce
" can we create a situation of minimum waste ? " researcher says
