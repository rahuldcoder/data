-- @entity2 's bushfires have such a long and destructive history there 's almost no day of the week that has n't been dubbed " black " or " ash " to mark a major conflagration			1
there was @entity9 in @entity10 in 1851 , which destroyed five million hectares and claimed 12 lives -- the first large - scale bushfire in the history of white settlement in @entity2			1
since then there 's been @entity17 in 1898 in @entity10 , which consumed 2,000 buildings , @entity19 in @entity10 in 1938 that killed 71 and destroyed 3,700 buildings , and @entity21 in the early 1980s that left 71 dead in the state of @entity2			2
most recently in 2009 , @entity24 claimed 173 lives in the state of @entity10 in southern @entity2 -- many of the victims unable to even get the distance of their own driveways before they succumbed to the intense radiant heat generated by a bushfire			2
many argue that @entity2 's catastrophic bushfires are simply a fact of life on a continent where its flora , heavy with combustible eucalyptus oil , constitute something of a seasonal time bomb			2
others say more sinister man - made factors are at work			0
changing climate @entity2 has had a troubled relationship with climate change -- its confused policies on a controversial carbon tax are credited with felling the @entity50 at the last election , while the new government controversially disbanded the country 's @entity53 -- but scientists say the latest bushfire season may turn up the heat on the climate - change skeptics			1
while the jury is still out on whether climate change is making conditions perfect for large - scale bushfires , scientists agree that bushfire seasons -- a regular occurrence on the @entity67 seasonal calendar -- are getting longer and the fires more intense			1
according to @entity70 , professor of forest ecology at the @entity72 , who has studied bushfires for more than 30 years , bushfire behavior is showing signs of change			2
" the problem with @entity2 is that the records are pretty shallow , which makes it really difficult to talk conclusively about any of the fire activity			1
but when you piece everything together there 's some very convincing evidence			0
aggressive fires " even the firefighters are reporting really unusual behavior , " said @entity70 , adding that firefighters are fighting bigger and more aggressive fires			1
" normally at night -- and this is borne out by firefighters in the @entity94 -- the fire will quell as the temperature cools			2
but firefighters are saying that because of the heat , bushfires are burning just as fiercely at night			2
it 's all getting pretty worrying			0
" he said duration was also a factor that was changing in bushfire behavior			0
" it 's no big deal to have a fire in october but to have one that has burned like this for more than a week at this level of intensity is unprecedented			0
" we are now looking at really catastrophic fire weather -- for october it just does n't compute			0
" anatomy of a bush fire : how @entity2 's explosive forest fires work a nation built on fire fire has been part of the @entity67 landscape since the dawn of time and its people have used fire as a farming tool for more than 40,000 years			1
one of the earliest colonial watercolors shows an @entity126 man gently setting fire to land that now makes up @entity129 's most expensive waterside suburb of @entity130			0
known as fire - stick farming , this mosaic of fire management systems not only flushed out game such as kangaroos and possums , it created new growth which in turn attracted more game			0
with indigenous people no longer part of the forest management equation , some scientists argue the fuel load that builds up from @entity2 's notoriously combustible vegetation is now one aspect that needs to be addressed			1
@entity148 meanwhile , the emerging academic discipline of @entity150 is looking at bushfires in @entity2 -- not just as a one - off catastrophic event -- but as part of an interconnected whole where forest fires around the world feed climate change and make conditions ripe for the propagation of even more fires			1
@entity70 says that deforestation fires alone -- the fires that have been used to destroy forests since the industrial revolution -- account for about one - fifth of all carbon dioxide committed to the atmosphere			0
" that 's a very significant component in global warming , " he said			1
one thing that is being noticed by scientists is that black carbon from forest fires is landing on ice sheets and accelerating ice melt			1
@entity175 factors " these are tricky and slippery factors because there are places where feedback from fires is actually causing cooling , especially in places where the loss of forest has caused the snow to lie for longer leading to regional cooling			2
" vegetation and natural conditions may change dramatically between @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , but one thing these fires all share in common is that they are becoming more regular because the climate is becoming warmer			0
@entity70 said that vegetation in parts of @entity10 , which normally completely regenerates over a 50 - year cycle , is now being burned as often as three times in the period of one decade			0
the particles from forest fires , he said , actually inhibit rainfall contributing to regional drying and warming , which creates a weather cycle conducive to fires			1
the problem for scientists , he added , was in connecting the dots with these patterns			0
" it 's like trying to find needles in haystacks			0

@entity2 has a long history of bushfires that predates white settlement
scientists say that , despite shallow records , bushfire seasons are getting longer
firefighters are reporting that fires are becoming larger and more aggressive
one scientist says forest fires around the world are contributing to global warming
