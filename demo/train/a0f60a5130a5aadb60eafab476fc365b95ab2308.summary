-- not everyone gets a second chance			0
@entity3 and @entity4 know that all too well			1
they appreciate it all the more because they have been given such a chance			0
@entity3 and @entity4 are among the men whose stories are featured in the new book " tested : how @entity12 , " which is due for release october 12			1
the subjects served anywhere from 18 months to 26 years behind bars for crimes they did not commit			1
ultimately they were freed -- many of them thanks to dna evidence			0
the book is the team effort of a mother and daughter , @entity24 and @entity25			2
@entity26 is a former child sex crimes prosecutor for the @entity27 in @entity28			0
but it was ultimately her role as a deacon in an @entity32 that led her to this project , she said			0
" the role of a deacon is to give voice to the needs of the poor and the oppressed , " said @entity25			0
" prisoners -- people whose voices might otherwise not be heard			0
when i heard a woman at a bible study talking about how she thought these men in @entity47 who had been exonerated were a powerful voice for justice in the world , i wanted to meet them			2
" although @entity25 had no writing background , her daughter @entity25 did , having been selected for the @entity54 's @entity55			2
with her help , they began interviewing the 12 men who would go on to be featured in " tested			1
" although these men all shared something in common , it turned out each had his own way of coping			2
" for some of them it was the unconditional love of a family member or girlfriend , " said @entity25			0
" for some it was the power of music or faith in @entity72			0
" it took @entity3 time to get to that point , though			1
@entity3 was arrested in 1986 at age 35 and charged with aggravated sexual assault			1
the girlfriend of the building manager of @entity3 's @entity47 , @entity28 - area apartment had accused @entity3 of robbing and raping her			1
a search of @entity3 's belongings revealed no clothing matching the description given by the victim			1
there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime			0
both @entity3 and his sister testified he was home when it occurred			1
still , the eyewitness identification led him to be convicted and sentenced to life in prison			0
" there was a time when i fell into deep depression and despair , " says @entity3 , 58 , about his nearly 20 years behind bars			1
" i became so despondent i considered suicide , even though i know i did n't do the crime			2
" throughout much of his term , @entity3 admits to giving way to anger and bitterness			1
however , he eventually came to an important realization			0
" i was tired of being angry , and i knew if i stayed angry i would have nothing to look forward to or hold onto , " said @entity3			1
if you hold on to anger , you ca n't see what 's up ahead			1
" before @entity3 actually achieved his freedom , he found spiritual peace through faith			1
@entity3 entered prison a practicing @entity117 , but converted to @entity118 while serving time			1
" i found the discipline that i was looking for , " @entity3 said			1
through having discipline i was able to find serenity			0
" @entity3 was eventually given access to dna testing proving he did not rape the victim			1
he was released in july 2006 and officially exonerated december 13 of that year			0
unlike @entity3 , @entity4 did not have the benefit of science in maintaining his freedom , and dna evidence played no role in his name being cleared			1
he was convicted of capital murder in 1997 and sentenced to life in prison			0
@entity4 spent the next 12 years of his life behind bars before being exonerated in 2009 after another man confessed to the crime			1
@entity4 insists that like @entity139 , he refuses to give in to anger when looking back on his experience			1
" in the growing process , we ca n't be angry about it , " said @entity4 , 39			1
" we have to keep on moving			0
i was the one out of a million chance that came through			0
i kept my sanity and fought hard for my freedom			0
now i 'm free , doing things i thought i 'd never do			0
" " tested " also addresses what life after incarceration has been like for these 12 men			1
some emerged from behind prison walls to find themselves like @entity155 -- in a world they did not recognize			0
" i did n't know anything about cell phones , " said @entity3			1
" when i saw people talking on them with headsets i thought they were talking to themselves			0
" @entity3 admits he was traumatized when he got of prison and had to learn how to live life as a free man once more			1
while happy about his freedom , he was scared and confused as well			0
@entity47 had changed a great deal in nearly 20 years , and most of his friends were either dead , in prison or had moved away			1
once again , he pondered suicide			0
normal , mundane situations for most people became a challenge for @entity3			1
" i would ride the bus , and i would be afraid to have a woman accidentally brush up against me , because i know how easy it is to be caught up in a lie , " @entity3 said			1
while faith had saved @entity3 while in prison , love saved him in freedom			2
" i 've got a good life now , " said @entity3			2
" i met a woman and married her			0
i 'm starting to come alive , and i 'm having the kind of life i think was meant for me all along			0
" @entity26 says her book is n't meant to be an indictment of the @entity190 justice system			1
to the contrary , she calls it a " great " system			2
however , she adds " tested " sends a message that mistakes can be made , even in a great system			1
" it 's easy to say all criminals say they are innocent so they all must be lying , " @entity26 said			2
" these 12 men prove there are people in prison who really are innocent			2
it begs us as a society to take responsibility for that and look again			0
" it 's a thought echoed by @entity3			1
" if someone is in prison and they say they are innocent ... believe them , " @entity3 said			2
" give them the benefit of the doubt			0
hear what they have to say and work with the evidence that they have , because someone is telling the truth			0
" @entity4 said he believes the path to vindication lies in more than just outside help			2
" life is full of doubters , but you have to make those doubters believe you were innocent , " @entity4 said			2
" doing that is just being yourself and fighting for what you believe in " " while " tested " is designed to highlight the stories of the exonerated men , @entity25 insists its message is something all readers can take to heart and learn from			2
" it can help anyone through dark times in their lives , @entity25 says			0
" their stories give you tools on how to deal with issues of despair and really get to a place of hope and forgiveness			0
" @entity252 's @entity251 contributed to this report .			2
