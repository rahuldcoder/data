-- the pap test , the gold standard for detecting cervical cancer for 60 years , may be losing its luster			1
an @entity6 advisory committee unanimously recommended this week that a particular hpv test become the first line of screening for the deadly disease			1
the test developed by @entity12 detects the dna of the human papillomavirus , or @entity15 , which is the cause of more than 99 % of all cervical cancers			0
the pap test is designed to look for abnormal squamous cells that could indicate cervical cancer			1
both tests are performed with a vaginal swab			0
up until now , the @entity22 was the first test women had to detect the illness , with the hpv test as a second analysis			1
but if the @entity6 follows the advisory committee 's recommendations , that would change			1
the committee , which voted unanimously to make the switch , would only allow the @entity12 cobas test to be used alone as the primary evaluation for women 25 years and older			2
although there are other @entity15 tests available , the @entity12 test detects two strains of the virus that are found in 70 % of all cervical cancers			0
" every year , 12,000 women are diagnosed in the @entity41 with cervical cancer			2
this is especially tragic because cervical cancer is a largely preventable disease , and it is well established that @entity15 is the cause of almost all cervical cancers worldwide			2
women need better access to screening tools that include primary hpv screening in order to reduce their risk of developing cervical cancer , " said dr. @entity46 , an expert in gynecology and pathology at @entity49			1
" i am pleased that the @entity6 panel recognized the importance of validated , scientific evidence documenting the use of primary hpv screening to detect women at risk of invasive cervical cancer and allow us to prevent cervical cancer from developing			1
" this does not mean the pap test will go away			0
it will really be up to the physician and the patient on how best to handle testing			0
but according to women 's health experts , in most cases , patients who do n't have hpv are less likely to need a @entity22 , which is why the advisory committee felt it best to recommend the @entity12 test be administered as the first form of detection			1
" i think anytime guidelines are changed , it becomes confusing for both patients and physicians			0
and we 're going to have to do more research on what 's best , " said dr. @entity81 , director of @entity82 of @entity83			0
" but the fact that the @entity6 is looking to make these changes says we 've made great strides in detecting and treating cervical cancer			2
" many physicians are viewing the recommendations with caution			0
" use of the pap test and hpv test in tandem , or co-testing , is currently the preferred method of cervical cancer screening in women over 30 , so ob - gyns generally use the combination			1
the use of the hpv test as a first - line screen is promising , and appears better than the pap test used by itself			1
the real question is how it compares to co-testing , which is not yet clear , " said dr. @entity108 of the @entity109 at the @entity110			0
@entity108 also spoke on behalf of the @entity113 at the advisory committee meeting			0
" about half of the cervical cancers diagnosed in the @entity41 are found in women who were never screened for the disease			0
at this time , primary screening is not part of any of the generally used clinical practice guidelines			0
" current @entity41 guidelines for cervical cancer detection recommend that women between age 30 and 65 undergo the pap test alone every three years , or both the @entity15 and the pap tests every five years			1
although the @entity6 does not have to follow the recommendations of its advisory committee , in most cases it does .			2

@entity6 advisory committee says a particular hpv test should be first line of screening
pap test has been first way to diagnose cervical cancer for 60 years
