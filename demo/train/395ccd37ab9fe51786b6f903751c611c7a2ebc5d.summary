-- a @entity2 soldier accused of killing 16 @entity4 villagers in a shooting rampage could face the death penalty if he is found guilty in a court - martial			1
the military has referred the case of staff sgt. @entity10 to a court - martial authorized to consider capital punishment , according to a military statement released wednesday			1
another six @entity4 were wounded in the spree near a small @entity2 base in @entity4 's @entity17 last march , the military said			1
" the charges are merely accusations , and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty , " the military emphasized in its statement			0
@entity23 ' defense attorney @entity22 said wednesday he did n't receive any notice from the @entity25 or the prosecutors about the decision to pursue the death penalty ; he said he found out about it through the media			1
" that 's how much we seem to matter to the prosecutors and the general , " quipped @entity31			2
" i am concerned this is a death penalty case , but i am not surprised			0
we 've prepared him for this			0
he knows he 's being singled out , " @entity31 said			0
" we understand that decision , but we think it 's totally irresponsible of the government and the @entity25 , " @entity23 ' lawyer said			1
" we think the @entity25 is attempting to escape responsibility for the decision to send @entity23 to @entity4 for his fourth deployment , knowing that he had ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) and a concussive head injury , " @entity31 said			1
" i think that the person who made the decision to send @entity23 to the most dangerous area in @entity4 in a small outpost is responsible for @entity23 being in @entity4 , and he should have never been there			2
" @entity23 ' wife , @entity55 , has called the accusations " completely out of character of the man i know and admire			1
" in a statement released wednesday , she wrote , " i no longer know if a fair trial for @entity61 is possible , but it very much is my hope and i will have faith			1
" she and their children visit @entity65 every weekend , and " for a few hours i can see and feel the love that flows " between them , she added			0
@entity4 authorities have pushed for swift action			0
" he committed a mass killing crime , and we would like the court in the @entity2 to implement justice and punish him according to the crime , " @entity70 , a spokesman for @entity4 president @entity71 , told @entity0 last month			0
but @entity31 said prosecutors may regret hastily moving the case forward			0
" the reality is almost every death case in the @entity25 -- almost every -- has been overturned on appeal , and there has n't been an execution in the @entity25 since the early ' 60s , " @entity31 said , referencing the 1961 hanging of pvt. @entity82			2
