@entity0 -- the repatriation to @entity4 of six citizens who defected to @entity6 in recent years has intrigued a @entity8 public accustomed to the flow of refugees in the opposite direction , an observer says			1
@entity8 's @entity12 announced the return of the six men , aged between 27 and 67 , at the truce village of @entity16 friday , along with the body of the @entity8 wife of one of the defectors			1
arrest warrants were issued in relation to the men for breaching national security laws , said the ministry , and investigations would be carried out into the circumstances of their defections , and into the woman 's death			2
@entity33 's official @entity32 news agency said it had " leniently pardoned " the men on humanitarian grounds , allowing them to reunite with their families because they " candidly admitted and repented their crime " of illegal entry			0
the men reportedly told officials that they had entered the @entity6 illegally through @entity42 between 2009 and 2012 , either by jumping off @entity42 cruise ships plying the rivers between the countries , or walking over the rivers when they were frozen , according to @entity8 's semi-official @entity49 news agency			1
citing officials , @entity49 reported that some of the men had suffered personal hardships , including business failures and family troubles , and expected that life would be better in the @entity6			1
some had participated in pro-pyongyang campaigns online , and anticipated a warm welcome in @entity6 in return for their efforts , it was reported			2
instead , the men claimed to have been held and questioned in detention centers for up to 45 months before being repatriated , said the report			2
the widower of the dead woman told @entity8 authorities he had strangled her as part of a failed suicide pact , according to @entity49 , but a statement from @entity8 's @entity12 said that @entity33 officials claimed the man had murdered his wife in a marital dispute			1
@entity8 's @entity74 and @entity12 told @entity1 they were unable to comment on the @entity49 report			0
@entity76 , founder of the @entity77 , said the story had been big news in @entity8 , where defectors to the @entity6 were a rarity			1
he said the men appeared to have been motivated to defect largely out of " socio - economic disillusionment " and desperation			0
" the people who left appear to have been part of the have - nots in the economy , " he said			0
" they definitely were n't greeted with leis and ukuleles playing			0
what they expected and what they got were vastly different things			0
" it shows you maybe the people that went there were n't your typical @entity8 citizens			0
i think it was a desperate , last - ditch move			0
" he said the return of the men could be viewed as a conciliatory turn from @entity33 following a tumultuous pattern of brinkmanship this year , which has seen tensions with the @entity8 soar over a nuclear test in february , soothe with the re-opening of the @entity114 joint industrial park then ratchet up again with the @entity116 's cancellation of scheduled reunions for separated families			2
it also served a propaganda purpose for @entity33 , in advancing a narrative that it was n't only @entity4 who was " accepting refugees in search of a better tomorrow			0
" " what they 're saying to @entity8 , but more importantly the world , is that it 's not just @entity6 that has economic woes , " said @entity76			1
@entity4 returned four @entity6 fishermen and their boat sunday , a day after the vessel crossed into southern territory suffering engine failure , @entity49 reported			1
in august , @entity8 fisherman @entity135 was reunited with his family in @entity4 more than 40 years after he was abducted by @entity6 agents , having escaped via a third country			1
journalist @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
