-- over the summer , veteran porn producer @entity1 was looking for performers for her new movie			1
a casting agent recommended a woman named @entity7 , and @entity1 put her on her short list			2
less than two weeks later , @entity1 found out @entity9 had @entity10			1
it shook her up -- imagine if @entity9 had been on her set , she thought to herself , possibly transmitting the disease to the other performers			2
that was the moment , @entity1 says , that she decided to make a fundamental change in the way she does business and become one of the few straight porn producers to require condoms on her set			1
" it just struck me we need to take a step back and look at how we can give people the safest work experience possible , " she says			2
" i can no longer roll the dice on my set			2
" @entity1 knows she 's going to get heat for her decision from within her own industry			1
even with three recent cases of @entity10 among performers ( @entity7 is one of them ) many porn producers and performers are still fighting against mandatory condom use			1
according to the @entity37 , which represents the adult entertainment industry , when they tried using condoms nine years ago after another @entity10 outbreak , the $ 14 billion - a - year business saw revenue decline as much as 30 %			1
the industry group says in the recent cases , the performers did not contract the virus at work and did n't transmit it to any other performers			1
after the @entity10 cases were revealed , the industry shut itself down temporarily and required all performers to be re-tested for sexually transmitted infections			1
the moratorium ended friday and performers went back to work			0
porn producers say performers are protected on the job because they have the option of using condoms if they want to			2
plus , performers are tested for sexually transmitted infections every two weeks , and producers have access to the testing service 's database that says whether performers are clear to work			2
in november , @entity68 passed an ordinance requiring condom use on porn sets , but industry insiders say the rule is not well enforced and often ignored			2
council votes for condom mandate in adult films " we support choice for performers , as well as the successful testing system that has been in place since 1998 , which have resulted in no on - set transmission of @entity10 in nine years , nationwide , " @entity77 , the coalition 's ceo says on the group 's website			1
" we all take a risk going to work every day , " performer @entity88 wrote in a blog post			0
" it 's a managed risk			0
and it 's something i choose to participate in so that i can get a paycheck at the end of my day			0
" but @entity1 worries that the risk is perhaps not so well managed			2
she points out that the @entity10 cases , plus some recent cases of syphilis and hepatitis , show testing is n't foolproof			1
first , performers can become infected during the two week window between tests			0
second , because of the nature of the @entity10 test , a person can become infected with the virus and still test negative for 7 - 10 days , according to the @entity37			1
@entity1 says she 'll require condoms even if she loses some viewers -- but she 's not so sure she will			1
" i know there 's a lot of talk about how porn watchers do n't want to see condoms and sales will plummet and everyone 's going to be miserable , " says @entity1			1
" but i 'm not buying it			0
" @entity1 , co-editor of " the @entity119 : the politics of @entity132 , " does however , buy a different argument : some female performers say condoms are irritating and after a full day on the set they end up with abrasions inside their vaginas , and bacteria and viruses could find their way into the tiny cuts			1
dr. @entity133 says he 's heard about this from many of his female patients -- he calls it " floor burn			0
" " this complaint is legitimate			0
it 's a real physiological problem , " says @entity133 , a past vice president of the @entity140 who runs reproductive health and sexually transmitted disease clinics in @entity143			0
" it 's like when you fall off a bike and get a scraped knee			0
it could get infected if you do n't clean it up , " he says			0
he says one solution might be to use a condom that 's not made of latex , since some people find those irritating and abrasive , but non-latex condoms are often not available in the larger sizes male performers need			0
but @entity133 is clear : even with the " floor burn " concern , it 's still safer to use a condom			0
" not using condoms is not an option , " he says			0
@entity1 agrees there 's no easy solution for " floor burn , " but condoms are still a must			1
" i know it feels like i 'm going out on a limb , but i hope that others will join me , " she says			0
they may already be joining her			0
while @entity88 , who 's acted in some of @entity1 's productions , says he prefers to perform without a condom , he wo n't say no to a condom - only offer			2
" if a porn producer is confident that he / she is able to maintain a viable business and provide the extra safety of barrier protection for performers , i 'm 100 % on board , " he wrote in an email to @entity0			1
prevent stds like a porn star @entity0 's @entity189 contributed to this story .			0

three porn actors recently tested positive for @entity10 , but did n't contract virus at work
porn producer @entity1 says she will require condoms on her set
last time the industry attempted to mandate condoms , they saw revenue decline , group says
