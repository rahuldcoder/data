, and he is just about wrapping up the explanation of its origin			2
let 's just say that @entity12 -- one of the most vilified entertainers in history , who has been accused of everything from causing the @entity17 school massacre to being the devil incarnate -- has a lot to say on the subject			1
" growing up going to @entity22 school and the concept that you 're born a sinner and you do n't really have a choice to change who you are has been hammered into my head and created the entire reason why i made art and made a band and made records called ' antichrist superstar , ' " he explained			2
" in any story , the villain is the catalyst			1
the hero 's not a person who will bend the rules or show the cracks in his armor			1
he 's one - dimensional intentionally , but the villain is the person who owns up to what he is and stands by it			1
he 'll do the things that are sometimes morally questionable , but he does it because it 's his nature to do it and it does n't fluctuate			1
it 's the fable of the frog and the scorpion , all those stories that just say , whatever you 're going to be , stick to it in confidence			1
do n't waver or life will f * * * you over			2
" after sluggish sales , tepid reviews and simultaneous accusations of being too shocking and not shocking enough , @entity12 said he " fell into a confusing state where i did n't want to be who i was			1
i needed to be the person i 'm going to be , the person i should be			2
i had to accept that this is what i am			2
and it took me the humility to say i have to make a comeback			2
" " on the last two records [ " @entity73 " and " @entity74 " ] , i think i started to write songs to make people feel like i was feeling rather than to make them feel something			0
and i was feeling like s * * * , so that was a really stupid thing to do , " he said			0
and though he does n't address it outright , that dark period coincides with @entity12 's protracted breakup with ex-fiancÃ © e @entity80			1
" of course , i 'm a person , " he said			0
" anyone 's personal relationships will affect what they do , but when i listen to @entity84 , i 'm not thinking about what he was going through in his personal life ; i just listen to it and am affected by it in whatever way			1
that 's what music should do			1
" " @entity5 " is the eighth studio album by the inveterate provocateur , but @entity12 said he 's dropped any expectation of people knowing his oeuvre until this point			1
" i went into recording this with the idea and common sense that people know who i am for many different reasons : columbine , music , publicity , celebrity bulls * * *			0
i had to realize that that does not equal who i am and simply had to make something that said this is what i am			0
" while writing for the album , he found recurring themes of guns and flowers emerging in his lyrics			1
" i do n't know where all this came from essentially			0
maybe it 's because my dad was in @entity121 , " he said , " and there 's an iconic image of the flower being put into the rifle			1
" and , much like with his own stage name , @entity12 has a flair for combining seemingly incompatible references to yield something greater than the sum of their parts			1
he was inspired by @entity135 's debauched poetry collection to create the track , " @entity137 " and he named another song " @entity139 , " because " a pistil is obviously the female part of the flower and i think that this record and everything on it is an implied threat			1
" @entity12 also drew upon other subversive works like @entity147 's " @entity146 , " ( itself an allusion to an @entity151 story ) and " @entity152 , " ( both @entity153 's and @entity154 's ) because " there 's always witches around , " @entity12 cautions			1
" many , many witches			0
and i do n't mean women simply			0
" the song " @entity160 " opens with a quivering recitation of the play 's famous soliloquy : " and all our yesterdays have lighted fools " the way to dusty death			1
out , out , brief candle ! " life 's but a walking shadow , a poor player " that struts and frets his hour upon the stage " and then is heard no more : it is a tale " told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , " signifying nothing			1
" " that quote can be taken as , woe is me , my life is s * * * , i give up , " @entity12 said			1
" when @entity152 said it , it was a resignation			0
but i read it differently			0
i started thinking it was empowering			0
for me , it was a resurrection			0
" indeed , " @entity5 " is @entity12 's return to form : a hard - rocking album , brimming with rich imagery , visceral blowback and the glamour - meets - gutter eroticism that his best work evokes			1
" if you like it , that 's great , " he said			1
" that 's what i want			1
but it 's not about my ego in that sense			2
living in @entity206 , it 's easy to have someone flatter you			2
that does n't help me			0
in fact , it makes me furious that people reduce my intelligence to think that simply complimenting me , for example , on what i said in " @entity216 " makes me more intelligent than they thought i was			0
i have to restrain myself and realize that they 're not trying to insult me , but it insults me that i need to do something that 's more powerful than a simple quote in a movie that i did n't create			2
" " i appreciate the window it opened up , " he continued , " but i do n't think it 's a great movie because it did n't answer a lot of questions in a period of my life and an event that affected my life so much			2
i have 36 school shootings under my belt -- i did n't do the shooting part -- but i had to realize that i ca n't be lazy or ignorant enough to think that just because i went through all this , people should be expected to like what i make			0
" in fact , @entity12 said he did n't record this album with the approval of his fans or critics in mind at all			1
rather , he said his biggest goal was to prove to his close friends and family that they were right for believing in him			0
" people like you for reasons			0
there 's no reason to change what you are , but if you 're not being you , then you need to acknowledge that			2
and it did n't take psychology or sobriety or anything that rhymes with a y at the end for me to realize it			0
" so , what did cause the shift ? " i just applied what i do when i go to a dinner party , " he said			0
" i 'm completely the person you think would be the most offensive , but i end up being the person that a lot of people listen to			0
i like to make people think differently than they did before i walked in the room			0
" while getting here may not have been easy for him , @entity12 said he will remember recording " @entity5 " more than any of his other albums both because he enjoyed the process and is proud of the result			1
" i 'm supposed to do this interview with you and say , ' oh i love my new f * * * ing record			0
it 's great , it 's better than all the other ones			2
i know it is , but i 'm not saying that it 's better than the other ones , " @entity12 said			1
" i 'm saying that i 'm better than i was and that 's the whole thing			2
" " if i were to go on @entity288 and i was doing some sort of , oh , would you like to know me ? situation , this record would represent me , " he mused			0
" now , would i get eights from it ? i do n't know			0
but this is me and i 'm not doubting that for a second			0
i think the most attractive thing in life is seeing someone that 's confident just peacocking			2
" and what better way to celebrate that than to include a cheeky rendition of @entity302 's " @entity303 " as a bonus track on the album ? the song features @entity12 's pal -- and fellow musician -- @entity309 on drums and guitar			1
" we started jamming -- i do n't even like to use that word because i think it sounds too musical and i consider myself to be more of a problem - maker than a musician			0
we ended up thinking , what could we do that would be really amusing to both of us because of what people think about us ? ' @entity303 ' really says it all			0

@entity3 's new album " @entity5 " comes out on may 1

" @entity5 " is the eighth studio album by the inveterate provocateur
