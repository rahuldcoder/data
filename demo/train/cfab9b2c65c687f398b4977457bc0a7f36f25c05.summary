-- @entity1 led home teammate @entity2 as @entity3 claimed a 1 - 2 in the @entity5 @entity4 on sunday			1
@entity3 have claimed all three pole positions so far this season , with @entity8 heading the grid in the first two races and @entity2 starting first at @entity11 , but had been hit by reliability issues priot to sunday 's race			1
however , they finally got their reward this time around , with @entity8 outpacing his @entity16 colleague after the first lap , holding on for a comfortable victory			0
@entity20 standings after three races " it was a great race for us and a great result for the team after the last two races when we just did n't get the results we wanted , " @entity8 told reporters			2
@entity30 driver @entity29 claimed third place -- although it proved another disappointing race for seven - times world champion @entity33 who was forced to quit the race early because of suspension problems			0
the grid had a lop - sided look to it due to saturday 's dramatic qualifying session which was hit by heavy rain			0
this meant the two dominant teams , @entity42 and @entity43 , were both towards the rear of the field as the race began and had to weave their way through slower cars in order to get amongst the top 10 for some world championship points			0
@entity43 's former world champion @entity52 drove superbly to battle his way to sixth position , after starting 20th , while @entity42 's @entity55 finished seventh and current world champion @entity56 was eighth			2
meanwhile , @entity58 winner @entity57 , who led the championship going into the race , saw his race ended on the penultimate lap due to an engine problem with his @entity42 -- after he had tried to overtake @entity56			0
with @entity57 failing to finish in the top 10 , therefore missing out on world championship points , @entity55 's seventh - placed finish proved enough for him to steal the overall lead from his @entity42 teammate the @entity69 , who has returned to @entity20 this season after suffering head injuries in an horrific crash last season , lies on 39 points , two ahead of @entity57 and @entity8 who are tied for second place			1
but this season promises to be one of the closest ever with only nine points separating the top seven after three different winners -- @entity57 , @entity56 and @entity8 -- in the first three races .			1
