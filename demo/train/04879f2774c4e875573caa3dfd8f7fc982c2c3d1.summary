-- if you 're not @entity3 , chances are you have never been as acutely aware of the political happenings of that country as you are now			1
@entity6 , the embattled and out - of - control mayor of @entity8 , has made sure of that , with his erratic behavior blazing across our screens more boldly and brightly than the reddest maple leaf that nation has ever produced			1
@entity16 's booze - soaked stunts and possibly drug - driven debacles -- now feeding the tabloids and late night talk shows more meat than they could digest in a year -- are probably nothing you have n't read about , talked about , thought about , or , unfortunately , laughed about			1
but what you might not have thought about is this : you know this man			2
you know and respect this man			0
he lives next door to you			0
he 's related to you			1
he might even be you			0
he is , in fact , everywhere			0
and there 's nothing funny about it			1
oftentimes functioning at levels you would never expect from someone with an addiction , the @entity6 in your life is trying your case , prescribing your medication , running your company , investing your money , flying your plane and governing your city			1
and guess what ? he or she is doing it from the grips of a progressive disease , making it look easy until , well , one day it suddenly looks horrible			1
i know -- i 've been there			0
was my own powerful reckoning with alcohol as excruciatingly documented and publicly consequential ? mercifully , no. not even close			0
could it have been , under different circumstances ? yes , perhaps			0
when you laugh at the mayor of @entity8 , you are laughing at the struggles of countless people like him that you 'll never know about			1
people who you otherwise admire and sometimes even vote for			0
you see , the biggest difference between mayor @entity6 and millions of other alcoholics and addicts who have built a successful career is n't that his behaviors are so much more shocking , it 's that his are alone in the center of a spotlight , on full display like the unsightly scar most of us are able to keep private			1
and he 's the mayor of one of the largest cities in @entity78			1
but if you dim that light and pause those digital recorders , you 'll see the mayor is not alone			1
surrounded by a vast sea of others shrouded in the same , strong , delusional fog of denial			0
a fog that 's born from the marriage of disease and diploma , sickness and success			1
and , you 're surrounded by them , too			1
hiding in plain sight , addicted yet outwardly successful professionals are a carefully disguised contradiction			1
we do n't have a problem with our drinking			1
other people have a problem with their drinking			0
you know , the type of people who could n't do half of what we 've done			1
the people who could n't even get our job , let alone do it			2
even when startling evidence to the contrary begins piling up , as it so clearly has with mayor @entity6 , we stick to our story and cling to our capabilities			1
to paraphrase the mayor , if we were alcoholics , we could n't show up to work every day			1
until the bitter end and long after the other relationships in our lives have tanked , we suit up and show up			0
and as long as we 've got that , we 're not alcoholics			2
or so our inner monologue goes			0
but , if you pierce through that devastatingly convincing argument we sell ourselves , and you , each of us is a walking bundle of profound denial , tightly bound up by an impressive tailored suit , spotless lab coat or an elegant black robe			0
bolstered by a track record of academic or professional victories , we 've got a deep stockpile of accomplishments to call upon in our war against reality			0
we have a formidable arsenal of achievements deftly deployed against you and your little idea that we need help			0
that 's cute -- that you think we need help			2
but you do n't get it			2
we 're not the kind of people who need help			2
do you even understand how talented and smart we are ? although denial is the hallmark characteristic of all alcoholics and addicts , unfortunately for us ours comes with a resume that pumps our ego and demands your respect			2
until , that is , it eventually does n't			2
last year i was sitting in my office with a client -- a highly successful , highly regarded attorney with a highly advanced drinking problem -- who after years of fervently denying his problem finally found his truth			0
he looked me dead in the eye , breathed a slow sigh of calm relief and said plainly : " the jig is up			0
" from that moment forward , his life changed			0
his denial had collapsed , thankfully before he did			0
so what was responsible for his long overdue recognition of the obvious and surrender to reality ? it was the fact that those around him had stopped excusing his reluctance to seek help out of deference to his professional stature			2
no longer were people overlooking his sickness out of respect for his career			0
more important , neither was he			0
as our science moves toward a better understanding of addiction and our culture moves toward a greater acceptance of it , it 's important to keep in mind that this disease walks upright through all corridors of our society , even those in the house of that accomplished professional next door			1
we might want to stop laughing now			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			1

@entity207 : we laugh about @entity8 mayor @entity6 's stunts , but addiction is serious
@entity207 : high - functioning addicts with big jobs are all around us , disguising their addictions
@entity207 : they think if they were addicts , they could n't go to work every day ; others believe it too
he says friends , family need to stop excusing their behavior because they 're professionals
