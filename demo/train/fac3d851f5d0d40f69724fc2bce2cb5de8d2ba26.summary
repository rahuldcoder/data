-- big - spending @entity2 club @entity1 have completed the much - anticipated signing of @entity6 international @entity5			1
@entity5 faces competiton from seven other forwards in @entity1 's first - team squad			1
the 25 - year - old was presented to the media on tuesday afternoon ahead of @entity1 's departure the following day for a three - match pre-season tour of @entity15			1
@entity1 revealed on monday night that the striker has agreed a five - year contract and would complete his move from bitter rivals @entity19 after passing a medical			1
a fee for the transfer has not yet been revealed , but it is reported that @entity1 have agreed to pay about $ 40 million to take over the player 's ownership rights from the sports agencies which previously held them			1
@entity5 denied claims by his former manager @entity28 that he had decided to leave @entity30 as long ago as january			1
@entity28 also said that he had offered the player a new contract on the night @entity19 played @entity33 in the @entity34 in march , but @entity5 did not return his calls or text messages			1
" i was there for two years and sir @entity28 never called or sent any text messages in that time , " @entity5 told reporters through an interpreter			2
" the only time he spoke to me was after the @entity34 final in @entity44 when i was going back to @entity6			2
it does n't seem that this is the way to treat a player in two years at the club			2
it does n't seem there is a line of communication			0
" it is @entity19 people talking about signing a contract ( in january ) but it is not true that it was decided then			1
i felt sir @entity28 and ( @entity19 chief executive ) @entity60 did not do enough to try to keep me			2
" the fact i did not stay at @entity19 was not because of the fans			0
they must understand a part of my heart will always be with them			0
they were always extremely supportive , even when i was n't playing			0
" city manager @entity68 confirmed that the club had been in contact with @entity71 over a move for @entity74 striker @entity73 , who has been linked with a $ 40 million move to @entity76			1
" i think there 's been discussions between ourselves and @entity71 but , as is my usual response about players that we have n't signed , really it 's not the right time or place to discuss that -- only in as much as yes , there has been contact , " @entity68 told reporters			2
" there 's a deal to be done , possibly , but it 's not been concluded as we speak			0
until it actually happens , really it 's not the time or the place to discuss it here			0
" the @entity92 have also made a huge offer for @entity95 captain @entity94 , but the @entity97 club have insisted that the @entity99 defender is not for sale			0
" i have fantastic respect for @entity94 , ever since i saw him as a young player when i was at @entity95 as a player myself , " @entity68 said			0
" he 's a great player and an outstanding captain			0
but he 's very much a @entity95 player at this moment in time			0
i think any manager would covet a player of the type of @entity94 , but at this moment in time he 's a player for @entity95 , so we have to respect that			0
" the high - profile capture of @entity5 is a big boost for the club and its billionaire @entity117 - based owner , who was forced to end his long - running bid to sign @entity120 striker @entity119			1
the @entity121 international , who had been offered a reported $ 400,000 a week wages , stalled on the move after being offered a new deal by the @entity128 champions , with some papers claiming he wanted a big chunk of any transfer fee paid by @entity1			1
if @entity68 does also sign @entity73 then the @entity132 will have nine strikers at his disposal			0

@entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 have also been given shirt numbers -- @entity5 will wear no. 32 -- in a 57 - strong squad named ahead of the new season			2
@entity68 has released former @entity99 international striker @entity149 , while @entity99 under - 20 forward @entity150 has joined @entity95 for a fee to be resolved by a tribunal			0
@entity5 scored 19 goals in 63 appearances for @entity2 champions @entity19 after joining from @entity155 , who he controversially saved from relegation despite a furor over his part - ownership with agent @entity161 's @entity160			1
