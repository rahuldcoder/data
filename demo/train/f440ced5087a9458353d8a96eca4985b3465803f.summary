-- in an age of unromance , of internet dating , of gut reaction cynicism -- i love hearing a story about how @entity7 of @entity8 met her fiancé @entity9			1
@entity7 made sure every week to do something scary that would in some way alter her future " tell the story again ! " i would beg her in the manner of a child wanting to be read her favorite fairytale , never tiring of the narrative , always smiling with delight at the ending			1
@entity7 met @entity9 when she was in @entity22 at the annual comedy festival			1
she was lining up for a hot tuna melt and a latte at a station café with 9 minutes to catch a train back to @entity28			2
she stood at the back of the long queue thinking , probably , of anything but love -- when she locked eyes with the young man behind the steaming coffee machine -- the man who in a few short minutes would be making her latte , than in an even shorter minute later would be consigned to the distant memories of coffee makers past			2
but when their eyes locked from over the @entity42 machine down the snaking queue , @entity7 felt an unmistakable current			1
could this be love ? and if so -- what could be done in the nine minutes she had left in the country ? @entity7 knew exactly what to do as she had formulated a plan that she had been following for some years			1
called future friday it was a game she played with herself each week			1
in order to gain more confidence and " get out of a rut " she decided that by friday each week she would do something scary that would in some way alter her future			1
she moved up the queue			2
she ordered her tuna melt			2
she took her coffee and sat in the train			2
six minutes until it pulled out bound for @entity28			0
she thought of future friday			1
she wrote her email address on a piece of paper , leapt off the train , raced back to the café , barged through the queue and gave @entity9 her address			1
" email me ! " she told the stranger as she thrust the paper in his hand and bounded back to catch her train			0
he did email when she was on a plane halfway to @entity84			0
they emailed for a while , then eventually he came out to @entity8			0
they got on with the business of falling in love and next month they will marry			0
unlike other pundits with a self - help plan , @entity7 's not promising hers will deliver riches , fame or love			1
what she does say however is that if you follow it , you will have a lot of adventures and take all sorts of risks that will enrich your life in many ways			0
@entity7 explains how it works : " @entity107 is so simple it 's embarrassing			2
by friday at the end of every week you must do something that is good for your future that is a risk or something scary			1
" for @entity7 , " it could be something like getting pap smear , making a dental appointment or telling someone that you fancy them or ring someone @entity119 and asking them if they 've got a job			2
i 've done all those things			0
" feeling like she was stagnating inspired @entity7 to develop the scheme			2
" being in a bit of a dead - end job made me want to do this - i thought i needed a trigger			2
it also lets you off the hook -- you can say i 've done my future friday now -- i do n't have to do anything else for the rest of the week			1
" @entity7 isolated particular areas of her life that she had neglected			2
" i put off making a dental appointment for five or six years			0
i put off telling men they were nice			0
i put off my pap smear all my life			0
" the list of things to do each week for future friday then became " a combination of exciting thrills and horrible must dos			1
" @entity7 made sure she told all her friends about future friday so she could get extra support during the difficult weeks			1
" you 'd get praise			0
i 'd tell various people about it			0
you 'd move enormous blocks			0
i really was quite down and just the little sense of doing stuff helped enormously			0
" memorable @entity160 included doing a stand - up comedy gig , flying in a jetfighter , and of course -- meeting @entity9			1
@entity7 started doing future friday in 1996 to boost her confidence and expand her world , but she had no idea how it would change her world			1
she was also contacted by a number of people " friends of friends , strangers " who had heard about future friday and started practicing it themselves			1
she recommends starting your own future friday if you are also " swimming around and drowning in a lot of stuff			1
" it 's a good way to anchor yourself			2
now i have formed a habit of getting on with things now -- today i had to get the celebrant form done and i just did it			0
" every time you tick off a future friday item @entity7 says to give yourself a pat on the back			1
" it 's about the power of affirmation and realizing you 're not a failure -- and its small and it does n't cost anything			0
you can take delightful risks			0
" @entity199 : pick a couple of basic but difficult issues in your life -- a niggle			0
make the appointment or ring about a job and you are on your way			0
go and see that man at the pub who you thought was cute			0
" i told a number of men i liked them and they did n't always feel the same way , but at least i did n't die wondering			0
" i did n't keep a diary but it 's a great idea to keep track of your progress tell other people and they can get inspired and also support you in your future friday			1
