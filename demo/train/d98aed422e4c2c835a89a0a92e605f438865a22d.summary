at first , everything seemed routine -- an uneventful end to a second day of meetings between @entity4 's bitter political rivals			1
then the military trucks arrived , sealing off @entity7 's @entity6 , where the talks were being held			1
armed soldiers in green camouflage rushed about , blocking entrances and exits as military vans , apparently carrying factional leaders , drove away			0
it seemed a coup was playing out , right in front of reporters ' eyes			2
soon , television programming fell silent , and @entity22 chief gen. @entity21 took to the air to confirm the news of a military takeover after five hours of talks meant to find a solution to @entity4 's festering political crisis			1
traffic was jammed downtown -- not unusual for rush hour in a city of nearly 7 million people			0
but it was surely a sign people wanted to make sure they got home before the military 's 10 p.m. curfew			2
there did not appear to be any tension or panic , but then again , @entity7 is home turf for establishment protesters seeking the removal of what they consider a corrupt , tainted government			1
with tv and radio broadcasts airing only military messaging , it was impossible to know what the reaction was in @entity4 's north , home to many populists angry over the recent removal of the country 's democratically elected prime minister			1
according to @entity61 , national security adviser to the former government , the protest encampment of the populist " @entity60 " had been cleared with military assistance			0
it was n't clear if there had been any injuries or arrests			0
at the sprawling protest camp of the anti-government protesters , called " @entity71 , " the military was nowhere to be found , and a sense of victory permeated the air			2
people sang , clapped and smiled broadly as they slowly packed up to go home , leaving the scene to resemble the closing hour of a festival			0
martial law : what it means soldiers , selfies and a military coup a cheat sheet to get you up to speed			0
