@entity0 , @entity1 -- a 15 - person ad hoc committee at @entity4 this week recommended against cutting down a portion of the " stadium woods , " a densely wooded area behind the football stadium , to build a new state - of - the - art indoor sports practice facility			1
the controversy came to a head when environmentalists realized early this year officials planned to chop down the wooded area containing some rare old - growth trees			1
the @entity17 have the third - longest college bowl game streak in the country , and have sold out every game since 1998			1
however , they have yet to win a national championship			0
the athletics department hopes a state - of - the - art facility nearer to the football stadium could help change that			1
blueprint plans that have been in the works for over a decade would require chopping down at least 60 trees over the age of 150			2
six of the trees have been found to be more than 300 years old			2
" the forest is in fact an endangered species in the @entity37			0
an old growth forest is , " @entity40 professor @entity39 explained , " it 's literally the rarest type of forest structure left in the @entity37			2
" however , the @entity44 still preferred the plan to cut down about three acres of the woods to make room for the facility , forcing @entity50 president @entity49 to appoint the committee to hear arguments and eventually make their recommendation on whether the facility should be built as planned or at an alternate location			1
" we 'll see what the report has to say and at the end of the day we 'll do the right thing , " @entity49 told @entity2 in an interview in may			0
@entity63 chair @entity62 told the board of visitors monday it was " in the university 's best interest " to build the facility in a different location			1
" the determining factor in the committee 's deliberations and recommendations was the demonstrated social importance of the @entity74 , " @entity62 said			2
signs urging " @entity76 " were placed in yards throughout @entity0 and a group called @entity78 created an online petition which has now been signed by more than 10,500 people across the country			0
the committee suggested that the new state - of - the - art facility instead be built in a location where tennis courts and a roller hockey rink currently stand			1
according to the committee , over 450 people signed another online petition ; this time requesting the courts and rink be replaced before the current ones are built on			2
" alternative sites for the courts and rink have been identified , " @entity62 said			0
@entity62 acknowledges additional cost and design issues may be incurred with the preferred location -- including having to build 20 % of the facility underground			1
so several additional options were presented during monday 's meeting -- some that would still force a small portion of the old growth forest to be cut down			1
professor @entity39 hopes the " no woods impact " option is the one ultimately chosen by school administrators			0
" this is a very , very easy decision , " @entity39 said , " to athletics , it 's just ... slightly less perfect for them			0
it is n't absolutely right adjacent to the practice fields , its one minute further up the hill			0
" included with their recommendations , the committee also suggested the @entity121 woods be designated for permanent protection and that a program would be developed to " enhance its ecological value and benefit " to the community			1
they also suggested a review of procedures for future updates to the university master plan to " safeguard against future controversies of this sort			0
" it is now up to school administrators , who will review the committee recommendations , then come back to the @entity138 with a final plan they will ultimately vote on			0
there is no set timeline at this point for when that will happen .			0

@entity17 wants to build a new , *$* 20 *million* indoor sports facility
many old - growth trees near @entity121 would have to come down
committee recommendation is to not cut down the trees
two suggested alternate locations have been proposed
