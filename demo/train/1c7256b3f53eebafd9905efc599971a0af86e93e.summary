-- on september 11 , 2001 , the city of @entity3 , @entity1 evacuated its @entity4			1
this is a modest building on the banks of the @entity7 , a short distance from the city 's central business district , a little over 10,000 miles from @entity11			2
it used to have a casino			0
before that , it briefly hosted an exhibition of waxworks from @entity18 's			2
if you ran a line from @entity21 in @entity22 through the center of the @entity24 , you would exit the planet not so far from here			0
indeed , @entity1 is , simply , a long way from everywhere			1
a flight to @entity29 takes 15 hours from @entity30 , 21 hours from @entity31 , 14 hours from @entity32 , and 10 hours from @entity33			1
there is no stopping off in @entity1 on the way to somewhere else , unless you 're headed to @entity36			1
this isolation is at the heart of @entity1 's identity : it is the reason the country has an aboriginal population that existed undisturbed for 40,000 years , and some of the world 's strangest and most inimitable flora and fauna			1
it is why the country was chosen to be a penal colony by the @entity49 in 1788			0
it is a place you go to be removed from the world			0
and yet on monday , the world 's eyes focused on @entity29 , as a man with a gun took hostages in what he claimed was an attack on @entity1 by the @entity60			1
a self - described cleric with a history of antagonism toward @entity1 military involvement in @entity66 , reports suggest he was probably a dangerously deluded loner rather than a member of an organized terrorist group			1
but by the time the siege ended , two hostages were still dead			0
this was n't @entity1 's first brush with terrorism			1
as i said , on 9/11 , terrorists were attacking @entity4 , so @entity3 evacuated hers			0
and this did n't seem silly at the time -- that day made all horrors plausible			2
no precaution was too extreme when only the day before it had been inconceivable that terrorists might take thousands of lives in @entity11 and across the @entity83			0
so for a while , @entity1 forgot it was n't part of the world			1
" we are all @entity83 , " @entity1 said on 9/11 -- september 12 , actually , on antipodean time , since @entity1 is so far away , it is usually a different day altogether			1
and we meant it : we were deeply shocked to see acts of foreign terrorism , always previously associated with unfamiliar people in unfamiliar places , happening somewhere " @entity95 , " become suddenly intimate and recognizable			2
over time , however , as the @entity97 became the @entity98 , and the @entity83 flags waved on tv , it became clear that although 9/11 affected the western world , at its most pointed and personal , it was an @entity83 story			0
@entity1 , as usual , was watching from afar			1
we sent troops to @entity66 and to @entity103 , maintaining solidarity with our @entity83 cousins , but ultimately , we saw that the @entity83 was " over there , " too			0
in 2002 , 88 @entity1 were killed by a radical @entity107 group bombing on the @entity109 island of @entity110 , a popular holiday destination			1
@entity110 is a mere 6 hours from @entity29 , and only @entity112 from @entity113 , the closest @entity1 city			1
it was a traumatic event , but again , it was n't quite here			2
more recently , there were police terror sweeps in @entity1 cities , with arrests made and , apparently , plots foiled			1
the federal government warned us that groups had developed with the motivation and ability to carry out local attacks			0
you live a charmed life in @entity1			1
the streets are safe , the weather is terrific , the people are friendly			0
the ocean keeps everything out			0
or , at least , slows it down			0
we complain when a car costs $ 30,000 or a tv show wo n't hit our screens right away , but it 's the distance that has allowed @entity1 to stay @entity1 in the face of relentless globalization			1
it 's given us more than a decade in which to rethink our ideas on society and our way of life , and the trade - offs between freedom and security we 're willing to make , without having to do so in the immediate aftermath of a national tragedy			2
if this hostage taker in @entity29 had claimed to be acting for some other cause -- disgruntlement at the tax code , or the high price of cars -- we would n't call it terrorism			1
we would call it what it is : a lunatic with a gun			0
but that would overlook the deeper trend , which is that @entity1 's oceans are shrinking			1
today technology allows a man to be more connected to militant extremists across the globe -- in spirit , if nothing else -- than he was to his neighbors in @entity176			0
he can find and latch onto toxic ideas from the other side of the globe and bring them into @entity29			2
whether we call it a siege or terrorism , it was something that used to happen over there			2
and now it 's here			2
it was n't unexpected , and arrived more benignly than it could have , and today the country will get on with business as usual			0
but life is becoming a little less charmed			0
we are no longer so far away .			0
