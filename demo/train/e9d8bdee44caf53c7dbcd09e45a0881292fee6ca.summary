virtual " killing sprees " in @entity10 and @entity11 led to a spike in the number of executions globally last year , according to @entity3 , at odds with a steady decline in the use of the death penalty around the world over the last two decades			1
executions by beheading , electrocution , firing squad , hanging and lethal injection rose by almost 15 percent in 2013 on the previous year , the organization said in its latest report on the death penalty released thursday			1
@entity19 executed more people than any other country last year			1
although @entity19 authorities treat official execution statistics as a state secret , @entity3 estimates thousands are killed under the death penalty every year , more than the rest of the world combined			1
excluding @entity19 , executions rose to at least 778 last year , up from 682 in 2012			2
@entity10 came in second , with at least 369 put to death by the state , followed by @entity11 ( 169 ) , @entity33 ( 79 ) , and the @entity34 ( 39 )			1
the @entity34 was the only country in the @entity35 that performed executions , although use of the death penalty declined last year , to 39 executions from 43 in 2012			0
@entity40 accounted for more than 40 percent of all @entity34 executions			0
in total , 22 countries practiced capital punishment last year , one more than in 2012			1
four of those countries -- @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 -- resumed executions after a hiatus			0
@entity3 could not confirm if executions took place in countries in conflict , but said it " can not be excluded " that executions took place in @entity58 and @entity59			2
at the end of 2013 , more than 23,000 people were on death row around the world			2
" the virtual killing sprees we saw in countries like @entity10 and @entity11 were shameful , " @entity3 's secretary general @entity64 said in a statement			1
he added , " those states who cling to the death penalty are on the wrong side of history and are , in fact , growing more and more isolated			0
" steady decline despite " alarming levels of executions in an isolated group of countries , " @entity3 noted that the majority of the world is abolitionist in law or practice			1
the use of the death penalty has declined in the last 20 years , and the number of countries enforcing the death penalty has fallen from 37 in 1993 to 22 last year -- evidence that executions are becoming " a thing of the past , " the report said			2
some countries that performed executions in 2012 , including @entity95 , the @entity96 and @entity97 , suspended use of the death penalty last year			0
no executions were carried out in @entity101 and @entity102 -- marking the first time since 2009			0
@entity104 -- the only country in the region that still has the death penalty -- did not execute anyone in 2013			0
in the @entity112 and @entity113 , many of those executed were convicted under " vague anti-terrorism laws , " the report said			0
in @entity10 , where official figures indicate a rise in executions of 18 % on 2012 , @entity3 said it had recorded " numerous cases " in which it appeared the death penalty had been used to oppress activities of @entity10 's ethnic minorities			1
@entity11 saw an increase in executions of more than 30 % compared to the previous year , the highest figure since 2003			2
most executions in recent years are thought to have resulted from convictions under an anti-terror bill that covers acts such as " provoking , planning , financing , committing or supporting others to commit terrorism			0
" the report said new counter-terrorism laws proposed by authorities in @entity59 would expand the scope of the death penalty , and could pose a particular concern for the @entity141 movement , which authorities classified as a terrorist organization in december , 2013			0
on monday , a court sentenced more than 500 supporters of ousted president @entity146 to death for killing a police officer			0
despite the high number of executions in @entity19 , there were " limited signs of progress , " according to the report			1
@entity19 's @entity154 announced an end to the practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners , and issued legal guidelines to ensure greater procedural protections in death penalty cases			1
in @entity113 , some countries including @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 moved closer to ending the death penalty through constitutional and legal review processes that " created real opportunities for the abolition of capital punishment			1
" in @entity172 , however , executions rose dramatically in @entity172 from six in 2012 to 34 last year			0
death for theft , drugs , blasphemy crimes that attracted the death penalty ranged from murder , robbery , drug trafficking , and corruption , to acts which @entity3 said should not be considered crimes at all , including " adultery , " " blasphemy , " and " sodomy			0
" the report noted that many countries use " vaguely - worded political ' crimes ' to put real or perceived dissidents to death			0
" in @entity193 , where the organization said at least 70 executions took place according to reliable reports , people were apparently executed for cannibalism , pornography , escaping to @entity19 and watching banned videos from @entity201			1
public executions were carried out in @entity10 , @entity193 , @entity33 and @entity172 , but in many instances executions took place in secret			2
@entity10 authorities acknowledged executing at least 369 people in 2013 , but credible sources reported " many hundreds " more " undocumented cases , the report said			1
in some countries , including @entity213 , @entity19 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity193 , confessions were extracted through torture or other ill - treatment , according to @entity3 , and proceedings in most countries that still execute prisoners did not meet international fair trial standards			1
a deterrent ? in five countries , @entity223 , @entity46 , @entity224 , @entity225 and @entity226 , prisoners sentenced to death were not informed of their execution beforehand -- neither were their family members or lawyers			0
almost all countries justified the use of the death penalty as an alleged deterrent against crime , a position which @entity3 said was becoming increasingly " untenable and discredited			2
" the organization , which opposes the death penalty in all cases , called on governments who " still kill in the name of justice " to suspend the use of the death penalty immediately , with a view to abolishing it .			0
