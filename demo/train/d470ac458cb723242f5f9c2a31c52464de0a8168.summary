-- imagine that @entity1 became the @entity3 nominee for president in 2016 , running against @entity5			0
and now imagine that he won the general election in a landslide , getting record - high vote percentage for the @entity3 and capturing states and constituencies the @entity3 had not won for decades			0
that seemingly unlikely scenario is the rough equivalent of what happened in @entity14 last week , when @entity15 , head of @entity14 's conservative , pro-business @entity17 , or @entity17 , and @entity19 noire among the @entity21 and @entity22 smart sets , led his coalition to the best general election performance in @entity14 in three decades			1
@entity15 will lead @entity14 's first majority government not run by the @entity26 , which has ruled @entity14 for the vast majority of its 67 years of @entity29			1
while @entity15 's electoral success first and foremost has implications for @entity14 , it has broader lessons to teach as well , ones that @entity3 might do well to heed as they attempt to develop a working majority in @entity37 's own increasingly multicultural democracy , which , however fractious , pales in comparison to the complex vagaries of @entity41 politics			1
that @entity15 has managed to create a broad conservative and pro-market parliamentary majority in a country with more than 1.2 billion people , numerous ethnic groups , thousands of castes , and 22 official languages is , to say the least , no small feat. to understand @entity15 , and the implications of his victory for @entity37 conservatives , one must begin by understanding the existing social and political landscape of @entity41 elites			1
the @entity26 , which for decades has championed welfare programs and central planning as its economic identity , has long been @entity14 's " natural " ruling party			2
@entity26 is more internationalist in its origins , and is favored by @entity14 's upper classes and intelligentsia			2
the @entity17 , meanwhile , is the party of the @entity61 heartland , culturally and religiously conservative , and generally speaking , far more supportive of the free market than @entity26			0
the @entity17 is also supported by businessmen and industrialists , and increasingly , @entity14 's rising middle class			0
in fashionable drawing rooms of @entity21 , the @entity17 is frequently treated with dismissal and derision , similar to that faced by @entity3 from the @entity70 to @entity71			0
it is a measure of elites ' continued control of @entity14 's image in both the national and international media , that @entity15 was regularly referred to in the media as " divisive " even after winning a popular mandate unprecedented in the last several decades			1
so how did @entity15 , long dismissed as unelectable , manage to win an unprecedented electoral mandate for his conservative party without compromising on his principles , and what can the @entity3 learn from him ? first , he embraced populist conservative themes consistently against his entitled and out - of - touch opponent , @entity84 , who claimed to speak for @entity14 's common man while living a life of luxury			1
@entity15 regularly mocked @entity84 , drawing attention to his role as the scion of a political dynasty that has ruled @entity14 dating back to his great - grandfather @entity92			2
as long as the @entity3 faces @entity5 and nominates someone without the last name @entity96 , it will have a compelling similar story to tell			0
potential candidates like @entity99 and @entity100 , both children of immigrants , will provide a welcome contrast to the privileged daughter of @entity105 and wife of the former president on economics , in the face of a @entity26 that endlessly discussed continued expansion of @entity14 's notoriously corrupt and inefficient safety net , @entity15 relentlessly focused on growth and economic opportunity			1
his positive message was about growing the pie , not sharing the crumbs , and could have been taken out of the playbook of free market conservatives from @entity119 to @entity120			0
furthermore , @entity15 's electoral wave decimated the @entity123 parties in @entity14 , which have long been a powerful national force and now find themselves with just 10 seats in the 543 - seat @entity126 , @entity14 's most powerful legislative body			1
@entity15 referred many times to his successful leadership of more than a decade of the @entity41 state of @entity131 , where numerous @entity41 and international businessmen testified to the way @entity15 's government streamlined regulations , cut through @entity14 's notorious red tape , and put people to work			1
compared to other @entity41 states , @entity131 's governance was known for its efficiency and probity			0
conservative economic reformers from @entity143 to @entity144 can take lessons from @entity15 's successful challenge to the establishment			1
throughout his career , @entity15 has also been an unapologetic social conservative			0
his political origins are in the @entity151 , a group that would be considered nationalist @entity61 fundamentalists ( somewhat politically analogous to conservative evangelical @entity154 in the @entity37 )			0
but while not backing down at all from his views during the campaign , he did not make them the focus of his effortâ € ” and in @entity14 as in @entity37 , focus and message matters			2
@entity41 , like @entity37 , were most focused on the economy , and for that reason , @entity15 's campaign made sure he was , too			1
@entity3 cultural and religious conservatives could do well to study @entity15 's campaign tactics for winning with unapologetic social conservatism without scaring off moderate voters			1
also notably , though @entity15 comes from a low - caste background in a country in which it is often said that " people do not cast their vote they vote their caste , " he did n't play the " caste card , " nor did he allow it to be played against him			2
instead , he dramatically expanded the @entity17 's appeal beyond its traditional upper - caste base , and in the process , he decimated the electoral clout of corrupt caste - based hucksters who have typically wielded heavy influence in @entity14 's @entity61 heartland			1
@entity15 's @entity17 campaigned seriously in areas where the @entity17 had never contested before			1
he did n't talk about @entity14 's 47 %			2
in @entity14 at least , identity politics has been trumped for the time being by the politics of prosperity			0
for those from @entity194 to @entity195 looking to write a new @entity3 narrative on race , @entity15 's campaign offered an example of forthrightly addressing a core issue of group identity without pandering			1
on foreign policy , he projected strength and confidence without unnecessary saber rattling			0
@entity205 frequently tested the @entity26 government , according to militants who said it tacitly cooperated with terrorist infiltrations and other provocations , most notably the 2008 terrorist attacks in @entity22 that killed and wounded hundreds			0
they will likely be more cautious about testing @entity15 , who was persistently critical of @entity26 ' often - timid reaction to @entity205 provocations , particularly on their contested border			0
here @entity15 's example would offer much to a @entity3 that has wearied of neoconservative interventionism , but is also critical of @entity221 's passivity and worries that our failure to draw bright lines around our interests has invited provocation			1
@entity15 won on not just substance , but style : he refused to let the traditional media play gatekeeper , instead skillfully using social media to reach out to @entity14 's rapidly urbanizing professional classes , to whose aspirations for good governance he spoke so strongly			1
at a time in which the @entity3 find themselves flatfooted in technology compared to the @entity238 , @entity15 ran technological rings around his liberal adversaries			0
some cautions are in order , of course			0
campaigning is not governing , and , as prime minister , @entity15 a relative novice on the national and international stage , may not be successful			0
he must also continue to deal with the legacy of serious religious violence that occurred in @entity131 during his first term as chief minister that left more than 1,000 dead and caused international concern			0
while @entity14 's @entity254 cleared him of charges that his government did not act decisively enough against the rioters , he was still blamed by others , including the @entity37 , which refused him an entry visa			1
there is little doubt that given @entity15 's history , he will be under a great deal of scrutiny to make sure the tragedies of 2002 are not repeated nationally			2
but whether @entity15 succeeds or fails in governing , the @entity3 could learn a number of lessons from his successful campaign , one that showed how an allegedly " extreme " candidate of a party disdained by media and cultural elites can achieve unprecedented electoral success without sacrificing its principles			2
in that vein , it is perhaps appropriate that @entity15 began his professional life selling tea in his family 's tea stall			0
in more ways than one , he represents the victory of @entity14 's tea party .			2

@entity288 : @entity15 's victory in @entity14 can teach @entity37 *republicans* some lessons
he says @entity15 was able to gain a majority in a complex nation of 1.2 billion people
@entity15 focused on the economy and expanded his party 's appeal to wider base , he says
@entity288 : @entity15 did n't let media define him and made skillful use of social media
