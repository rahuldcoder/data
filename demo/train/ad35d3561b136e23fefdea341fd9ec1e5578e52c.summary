-- @entity2 chief @entity1 took to the blogs wednesday evening to combat recent reports of @entity5 clamping down on @entity2 's openness			1
" we continue to be an open source platform and will continue releasing source code when it is ready , " wrote @entity1 on the @entity7			2
" as i write this the @entity2 team is still hard at work to bring all the new @entity13 features to phones			2
as soon as this work is completed , we 'll publish the code			0
this temporary delay does not represent a change in strategy			0
" @entity5 has championed its platform as the open alternative to @entity24 's closed @entity23 system			1
that openness has been called into question recently , as @entity5 has yet to release the @entity13 source code to all developers and manufacturers			1
@entity13 is @entity2 's first tablet - optimized software release			1
@entity1 cites the difference in form factor between tablets and phones as the reason @entity5 has n't released @entity13 's source code to device manufacturers and developers			1
@entity39 is the exception : the company 's @entity13 - fueled @entity42 tablet has been on the market for more than a month , which makes @entity5 's decision to hold the code from wide release a bit mystifying			1
members of the @entity2 industry showed faith in @entity5 , however			2
" they say they 're going to release it , i 'm not gon na call them liars , " @entity53 executive director @entity53 told @entity0 in an interview			0
the @entity2 os is based on a version of the @entity60 , which has been an open source , collaborative platform since its release decades ago			1
@entity1 's post also addressed questions raised in a recent @entity67 story about @entity2 's level of control over its partners			1
@entity71 wrote : over the past few months , according to several people familiar with the matter , @entity5 has been demanding that @entity2 licensees abide by " non-fragmentation clauses " that give @entity5 the final say on how they can tweak the @entity2 code -- to make new interfaces and add services -- and in some cases whom they can partner with			2
@entity1 combats this claim directly , stating @entity5 's so - called " anti-fragmentation program has been in place since @entity2 1.0 , " citing a list of compatibility requirements manufacturers must adhere to in order to market a device as " @entity2 - compatible			1
" he 's referring to @entity2 's compatibility test suite , or @entity92 , an automated litmus test to measure whether or not a piece of hardware can claim to run @entity2			1
" our approach remains unchanged : there are no lock - downs or restrictions against customizing @entity101 , " wrote @entity1			0
@entity39 vouches for @entity1 's statement			0
" in the time since we 've started working with @entity5 , our relationship has matured , but it is n't any more limiting than it ever has been , " @entity103 , @entity39 's vp of mobile software development , told @entity0			2
" i do n't believe that anything has changed in the @entity92 since the beginning			0
" finally , @entity1 emphatically denied other rumors of arm - chipset standardization in the platform , much of which arose in the wake of an anonymously sourced @entity115 story			1
" there are not , and never have been , any efforts to standardize the platform on any single chipset architecture , " @entity1 wrote			0
with the @entity120 , @entity5 's first flagship phone , the company worked with @entity123 to install its 1 - @entity125 arm processors in the @entity127 - manufactured handsets			1
the subsequent @entity128 came equipped with @entity131 's 1 - @entity130 processor , which is also based on arm architecture			0
it 's out of character for @entity1 and @entity2 to post such a defensive update			2
rumors circulating in the media are usually given a brusque " no comment " by @entity5 's communications team			0
but the title of @entity1 's post -- " i think i 'm having a @entity143 moment " -- explains it all			0
@entity143 coined the acronym @entity146 ( fear , uncertainty and doubt ) in 1975			0
after leaving @entity150 to form his own it company , @entity143 claimed he suffered attacks by @entity150 sales staff attempting to undermine his new venture			0
all of this negative attention is n't good for @entity2 's " open " image , and maybe that 's what overcame @entity1 's reluctance to speak : too much @entity146 about @entity2 's future			1
whether or not this fud is warranted , however , remains to be seen			0
