-- in their attacks on the food stamp program , some @entity2 presidential candidates are leaving a deeply misleading impression of the nation 's leading anti-hunger program			1
no one aspires to enroll , but for those who must , it is an essential lifeline that addresses one of the harshest impacts of poverty and unemployment -- hunger			2
the food stamp program , now officially known as the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , provides about 46 million @entity18 in about 22 million low - income households with debit cards to buy food each month			1
participants include families with adults who work in low - wage jobs , unemployed workers and people on fixed incomes , such as @entity29			1
about three - fourths of @entity17 recipients live in households with children ; more than one - quarter live in households with seniors or people with disabilities			1
@entity17 reduces poverty while providing people with much - needed help to buy food			1
the program kept more than 5 million people out of poverty in 2010 and lessened the severity of poverty for millions of others , under a measure of poverty that counts @entity17 benefits as income			1
@entity17 is also highly efficient , with one of the most rigorous quality control systems of any public benefit program			1
in 2010 , only 3 percent of payments went to ineligible households or to eligible households in excessive amounts			1
payment accuracy has been improving in the past few years , despite a large increase in @entity17 enrollment			2
while some have attributed that enrollment increase to @entity62 administration policies -- @entity63 has termed president @entity62 the " food stamp president " -- in reality it has two main causes that have little to do with this administration			1
millions of people hit by the recession a few years ago became eligible for @entity17			2
today 's large @entity17 caseloads mostly reflect the extraordinarily deep and prolonged recession and the weak recovery that has followed			1
long - term unemployment hit record levels in 2010 and has remained extremely high			2
today , 43 % of all unemployed workers have been out of work for more than half a year ; the previous @entity78 high was 26 % in 1983			1
workers who are unemployed for a long time are more likely to deplete their assets , exhaust unemployment insurance and turn to @entity17 for help			0
it is one of the few safety net programs available to them			0
in most states , other programs -- such as cash assistance under the @entity89 and state general assistance programs -- have not responded effectively to the rising need brought on by the economy			0
more than one in five workers who had been unemployed for over six months received @entity17 in 2010 , according to @entity97 's @entity96			0
the increase in enrollment is also because it 's easier for eligible families to participate			2
federal and state officials as well as @entity97 , with leadership from both parties , have worked throughout the last decade to simplify @entity17 procedures so that the program can reach more eligible households , particularly working families and senior citizens			2
these efforts are paying off : the share of eligible individuals who participated in @entity17 rose from 65 % in 2007 to 72 % in 2009 , the most recent year for which we have the data			0
the recent growth in @entity17 enrollment and spending because of the sluggish economy is temporary			0
one of @entity17 's great strengths is its ability to respond , quickly and automatically , to changes in the economy : enrollment grows during downturns but contracts during periods of economic growth			0
the @entity130 predicts that @entity17 spending will fall in the coming years as the economy recovers more robustly and the temporary benefit increases of the @entity134 expire			0
by 2021 , @entity17 is expected to return nearly to pre-recession levels as a share of the economy			0
over the long term , @entity17 is not growing faster than the economy			0
so it is not contributing to the nation 's long - term fiscal problems			0
a weak economy has swelled the numbers of unemployed workers and poor families			1
that 's a serious problem that our policymakers need to address			0
in the meantime , @entity17 helps protect the most vulnerable from very difficult circumstances			0
join @entity152 on @entity153 and follow updates on @entity155			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1

@entity158 : *criticism* aside , food stamp program is a lifeline for 46 million people
@entity164 : program is highly efficient ; only 3 % of *funds* went to ineligible people
numbers of recipients growing because of weak recovery and *joblessness* , she says
number of recipients will go down as jobs increase , she says , but the need is high now
