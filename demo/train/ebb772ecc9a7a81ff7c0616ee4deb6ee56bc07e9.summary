-- @entity1 has made a significant advancement in its nuclear program with the completion of its underground uranium enrichment facility near the holy city of @entity8 , according to a report released friday by a @entity11 watchdog group			1
the @entity13 report stated @entity1 has now installed all of the nearly 2,800 centrifuges it will use to enrich uranium at the @entity18 plant , but not all the centrifuges are operational			0
the @entity13 also says @entity1 has increased its stockpile of both 5 % and 20 % enriched uranium , which can more readily be converted to a weapons grade level			0
@entity1 maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes , but the @entity24 , @entity25 and other nations contend @entity1 seeks to build nuclear weapons			1
the @entity18 facility was built into the side of a mountain , making it less vulnerable to attack			0
@entity25 has made it clear that completion of the plant could make it difficult to stop @entity1 if it decides to go ahead and build nuclear explosives			0
@entity1 still not cooperating with nuclear inspectors in august , the agency reported that @entity1 had stepped up its production of high - grade enriched uranium and had relandscaped one of its military bases in an apparent effort to hamper a @entity11 inquiry into its nuclear program			1
friday 's report said @entity1 still has n't allowed the agency access to the military site , called @entity50			1
the agency has been seeking access since january			0
the new report repeated the conclusion reached in august that " extensive activities " at the @entity50 site are certain to have " seriously undermined " the agency 's verification process			2
those activities include " significant ground scraping and landscaping " with new dirt roads , the august report said			0
many @entity64 diplomats and nuclear experts believe the @entity50 site has been secretly used to test high - explosive nuclear triggers , an essential step toward achieving a weapons capability			2
@entity1 denies that @entity50 has any role in its nuclear program			1
" the agency reiterates its request that @entity1 , without further delay , provide both access to that location and substantive answers to the agency 's detailed questions regarding the @entity50 site , " friday 's report said			1
" given the nature and extent of credible information available , the agency continues to consider it essential for @entity1 to engage with the agency without further delay on the substance of the agency 's concerns , " the report said			2
the @entity13 once again stated that @entity1 is not cooperating sufficiently with the agency for it to conclude that the country is conducting " peaceful activities			0
" the agency said that despite its effort to step up talks with @entity1 , the nation has offered no " concrete results			0
" the agency 's director general is , in turn , " unable to report any progress on clarifying issues relating to possible military dimensions to @entity1 's nuclear programme , " the report said			1
@entity13 and @entity1 officials have scheduled a december 13 meeting in @entity104 to address the ongoing issues in the country 's nuclear program , the report said			1
putting a price on war with @entity1 @entity0 's @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			2
