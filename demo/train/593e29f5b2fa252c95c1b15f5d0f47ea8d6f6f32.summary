@entity0 -- the people of @entity3 are coming to terms with the first suicide bombing on their soil , an attack which stunned the nation and in the words of the country 's foreign minister could have been " catastrophic			1
" authorities say that only the premature detonation of @entity15 's device likely prevented many others from being killed			0
" fifty , 60 , 70 people could have been killed -- this was not amateur hour , " @entity17 , a terrorism expert at the @entity18 , told @entity1			0
the incident did not surprise counter-terrorism experts			0
" for some time @entity3 officials have been worried about a growing threat , both from overseas terrorists and from home - grown extremists within the country , " says @entity24 , a @entity25 terrorism expert , who has extensively researched @entity27 militants in @entity28			1
at the heart of @entity3 's unwanted new - found status : cartoons			1
three years ago , @entity39 published an image of the @entity41 in a @entity3 newspaper			1
@entity3 became an object of jihadist hate , just as @entity25 did in 2005 after the publication in a newspaper there of caricatures of the @entity41			1
in march of this year , authorities in @entity49 and the @entity50 broke up a plot to murder @entity39			0
one of those allegedly involved was @entity53 , a @entity54 woman who identified herself online as @entity53			0
@entity53 has pleaded not guilty to providing material support to terrorists			0
in july ' @entity58 ' magazine , an online magazine by @entity61 's @entity60 arm , put @entity62 at the top of an assassination list			0
and a few weeks ago @entity65 , @entity61 's affiliate in @entity66 , released a video in which a @entity3 member exhorted @entity3 militants to kill @entity39			1
these threats follow an audiotape back in 2007 from @entity72 , then a senior figure in @entity61 in @entity74 , who promised " a reward of $ 100,000 for anybody who kills this @entity79 criminal			0
this reward will be raised to $ 150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb			0
" @entity83 also called for attacks against @entity3 businesses , including @entity86			1
there 's an ironic twist in the mention of @entity86			0
back in the 1970s @entity91 went on vacation to @entity3 because an older brother was trying to buy @entity86 trucks for the @entity91 family construction company			1
during downtime , the brothers liked nothing better than to speed through the @entity3 countryside in the family @entity101			1
and for a long while , @entity3 got a pass from international jihadists			1
in an october 2004 videotape @entity61 's leader disputed president @entity108 's accusation that @entity61 hated freedom by retorting : " let him tell us why we did not strike @entity3 , for example			1
@entity3 authorities say e-mails sent by @entity115 just before the attempted attack cited @entity3 's tolerance of the @entity119 cartoon as one of the reasons he was targeting the country			1
he also said the attack was due to the continued presence of @entity3 troops in @entity127			1
@entity3 , though not a member of @entity129 , currently has around 500 troops in @entity127 assisting the @entity129 mission			1
investigators are still untangling 28 year old @entity115 's path to radicalism			0
his family left @entity74 in the early 1990s and settled in @entity3			1
in 2001 , at the age of 19 , he came to @entity137 to study and settled in @entity138 -- a town in southern @entity137 identified in a leaked @entity141 intelligence report two years ago as having one of the main concentrations of @entity145 extremists in the country			0
for many young muslims in @entity148 the last decade has been unsettling , with the wars in @entity74 and @entity127 leading to a perception that their religion is under attack			0
@entity115 seems to have subscribed to this view , according to religious leaders at an @entity156 in @entity138			0
they said he was unwelcome because of his extreme views			0
the @entity3 authorities will now be taking a fresh look at radical islamists in the country			1
in october @entity3 raised its terrorist threat level to " elevated " based on security services ' finding that there had been " a shift in activities among certain groups in @entity3 , judged to be targeted at @entity3			1
" among @entity3 's estimated 300,000 muslims , the vast majority have no time for @entity61 's extremist message			1
but a radical fringe has emerged , especially among younger immigrants , and the children of immigrants			0
according to @entity28 counter-terrorism expert @entity24 , the radical extremist fringe is more fragmented in @entity3 than in some other @entity148 countries such as @entity141 where a nationwide network of extremists has emerged			2
but clusters of militants are increasingly on the radar of @entity3 's counter-terrorism services			2
@entity3 counter-terrorism sources tell @entity1 more than 100 are being monitored			2
their attention has focused on an extremist fringe within @entity3 's @entity188 , who have been relatively isolated from the rest of society and are a cause of major concern			1
a growing number of @entity3 citizens of @entity66 descent have gone to @entity66 to join @entity65			2
just last week two @entity3 citizens of @entity66 descent were sentenced for " planning terrorist crimes " in @entity66			2
according to @entity24 more than 20 @entity3 citizens are believed by @entity3 security services to be fighting with @entity65 in @entity66			2
some have become prominent - like @entity202 , who preached an extremist message in a @entity205 mosque in the early 1990s and once fought in @entity127			0
swedes have also traveled to other jihadist fronts in recent years , including @entity74			0
a report by @entity3 's intelligence agency due out wednesday is expected to highlight the domestic threat posed by @entity3 who have received terrorist training , according to the @entity3 newspaper @entity211			2
several @entity3 militants have also made the trip to @entity61 's safe haven in the @entity127 - @entity216 border region , according to counter-terrorism officials			2
in august 2009 four @entity3 were arrested by @entity216 security services as they tried to enter the tribal agency of @entity220			2
" travel to @entity216 is becoming a big concern for @entity3 counter-terrorism services , " @entity3 terrorism expert @entity17 told @entity1			1
in another link to @entity216 , @entity3 counter-terrorism sources tell @entity1 that a @entity3 militant -- still being monitored by security services in the country -- played a key role in a terrorist network linked to @entity232 , an @entity50 jihadist , plotting an attack against a @entity25 newspaper last year			2
@entity232 , who says he working with @entity235 , a @entity216 @entity61 operative , has pleaded guilty to the plot			0
now @entity3 's counter-terrorism agencies have another case to investigate			2
did @entity115 have any help or co-conspirators in @entity3 ? where did he obtain the explosives he used in the attack ? " we more or less consider it as a given that he had outside help in some way , at least before he reached the point of execution , " a @entity3 police spokesman said monday			0
the questions are : who , where and when ?			0
