@entity0 -- president @entity2 's been in the bull 's eye of @entity5 and conservatives since 2008 , but after wednesday 's hearing on last september 's terror attack in @entity9 , @entity10 , many on the right are shifting their aim at former secretary of state @entity13			1
soon after the hearing by the @entity5 - led @entity15 looking into the events surrounding the death of the @entity19 ambassador to @entity10 and three other @entity19 , a recently formed pro-republican opposition research group blasted out an e-mail with the headline " @entity23			2
" @entity24 then followed up thursday with a web video which it says outlines " the serious questions raised about @entity13 's leadership yesterday in a @entity15 hearing			2
" the @entity30 and @entity31 , the @entity33 - backed @entity32 , also issued e-mails critical of @entity35 , @entity19 's top diplomat at the time of the attack last september 11			1
the group put out a web video friday morning that asks if @entity35 " was part of a coverup			0
" and sen. @entity42 of @entity43 , a possible 2016 @entity5 @entity44 contender , criticized @entity35 in an interview on thursday on @entity46			0
mother of @entity9 victim : i blame @entity13 many republicans see the deadly attack on the diplomatic compound in @entity9 and the initial reaction by the @entity54 and the @entity44 as a huge scandal , one that they feel @entity56 tried to cover up with the president 's re-election , at the time , less than two months away			1
the @entity5 accuses the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack , of botching the response to it , and of misleading the public in its slow - to - evolve explanation of events			0
they point to five tv appearances the sunday following the attack by @entity70 , the @entity19 ambassador to the @entity71 , who called the armed assault a " spontaneous protest " rather than an act of terrorism			2
many @entity56 disagree and call the @entity5 drumbeat a " witch hunt			0
" while the president is definitely still in conservative 's line of fire over @entity9 , 2016 politics are also at play in this story			2
@entity2 ca n't run for a third term and @entity35 , who 's weighing a @entity44 run , would be the instant front - runner for the @entity56 nomination if she launches a bid for president			0
@entity35 stepped down as secretary of state with sky - high poll numbers , but the incident in @entity9 is a stain on her record at the @entity54			1
the question is whether it could come back to haunt her if she does seek the presidency			0
@entity99 calls for @entity44 to release @entity9 emails an independent review of the @entity9 incident , led by adm. @entity103 , a former chairman of the @entity104 , and former ambassador @entity105 , discovered no wrongdoing by @entity35			1
but critics noted at the time that neither @entity103 nor @entity105 interviewed @entity35			0
before she stepped down as planned in late january , @entity35 testified for hours on @entity110 on the @entity9 attack			1
she was forceful in her defense and the conventional wisdom at the time was that she was not politically wounded			0
but the story was given new legs thanks to the @entity44 hearing , which showcased the testimony of @entity54 whistleblowers who had not previously testified , including the riveting details from an official who was on the ground in @entity122 at the time of the attack in @entity9			1
even before wednesday 's hearing , there was plenty of hype			1
doomed @entity10 ambassador : ' we 're under attack ' " i think the dam is about to break on @entity9 , " sen. @entity131 wrote on his @entity133 page			0
" we 're going to find a system failure before , during , and after the attacks			0
we 're going to find political manipulation seven weeks before an election			0
we 're going to find people asleep at the switch when it comes to the @entity54 , including @entity13 , " added the @entity139 @entity5 , who 's been a longtime critic of the administration 's role in @entity9			1
but @entity35 's specific role did not dominate the hearing , with only one @entity5 congressman on the panel trying to drill down for specifics			1
the question now is whether any smoking gun emerged from wednesday 's hearing regarding what @entity35 knew and when she knew it			1
republicans and @entity56 obviously disagree on this question " i rather doubt the current right - wing demagoguery is going to hurt @entity13 if she chooses to run , " said @entity56 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity161 , who was a top political adviser in @entity35 's @entity44			1
what the @entity2 administration has said about the @entity10 attack @entity5 strategist and @entity1 contributor @entity166 disagreed			0
" it is increasingly looking like the only president named @entity35 may be @entity175 , " said @entity166 , who is spearheading a new super pac called @entity169 to refocus the party 's messaging and policy goals			0
. one thing 's for sure : wednesday 's hearing wo n't be the end of this story			2
thursday morning house speaker @entity99 called on the president to release emails that he says show how the @entity44 wanted to change the @entity9 attack " talking points			2

after wednesday 's @entity9 hearing , many on the right are shifting their aim at @entity13
the incident in @entity9 is a stain on @entity35 's record as @entity19 's top diplomat
before she stepped down , @entity35 testified for hours on the @entity9 attack
