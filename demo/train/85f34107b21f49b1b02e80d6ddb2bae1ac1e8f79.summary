the etf in question was one which tracked the volatile silver futures market and was priced in @entity5 francs , they say			1
@entity11 's job would have been to hedge , or reduce , the bank 's risk on the silver and franc positions by buying and selling each			1
it is thought that he may accidentally have left the @entity5 franc vs @entity55 dollar side of the equation uncovered and got stung when the @entity5 national bank intervened to defend the franc in early september			1

as to the epidosde at @entity4 , @entity20 , the analyst , outlined three possible ways a loss that big could take place : intentional fraud , " basic stupidity " in trading strategy , or what the banking industry calls " fat fingers , " which means typing the wrong number by accident			2
perhaps the trader " put in an extra zero so instead of buying a million he or she bought ten million -- could be a problem , " @entity20 said			2
@entity153 , a former trader who is now a partner at @entity154 in @entity0 , said chaos in the markets could have put more pressure on a trader desperate to hang onto his job			0
" trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year , " said @entity153			0
" with the volatility in banking stocks , commodities and currencies , things can go wrong really , really easily			0
if you 're worried about your job and you try to hide ( a mistake or loss ) , you can see how these situations arise			0
" a bank 's risk management division is supposed to examine a trader 's activities , he said			2
" he must have done something that he was n't supposed to do , obviously , " @entity153 said			0
@entity4 said no client positions were affected by the loss , which is still being investigated			2
but the " unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank " could cause @entity4 to post a loss in the third quarter of this year , it said			1

@entity4 is not likely to collapse , but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company , @entity153 said			1
there is a " much higher chance that this bank will now be broken up " into a wealth managament firm and an investment bank to reduce clients ' exposure to investment banking losses , he said			0
he favors that alternative , he said			0
" the banks are too large , " @entity153 said			0
" the products are so complicated , and the management does n't understand it			0
