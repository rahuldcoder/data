the day before @entity2 secretary @entity1 resigned in may , nearly 25 senators signed a letter calling for him to step down amid a widening scandal over delayed medical care for vets			1
in the weeks before that , lawmaker after outraged lawmaker rose to denounce systemic problems at the sprawling agency that provides medical and other care to more than 8.5 million veterans			0
reports of " cooked books , " dying patients on waiting lists , and a warped management culture made headlines			0
spearheaded by @entity22 reporting , the latest news was certainly troubling and upped the stakes in @entity24 amid a midterm year			0
it was high drama and members of @entity29 were in the thick of a political firestorm and some people were even pointing fingers at them			1
facing voters in november , they needed to act , and fast			0
@entity35 went the rhetorical fever , down went @entity1 and in went reform - minded proposals to hire more doctors and nurses and build more medical facilities			0
the estimated cost -- $ 35 billion over 10 years			0
passage was uncommonly swift and bipartisan in both houses with promises to quickly negotiate a final version			0
veterans neglected for years in @entity2 facility , report says oddly functional a @entity29 infamous for its legislative dysfunction was oddly functional			1
vets could get care outside the @entity2 under bill passed by @entity53 " it 's very clear the status quo is not acceptable and it 's time for real change , " @entity55 chairman @entity54 said at a recent hearing			1
while the step was dramatic , serious shortcomings at the @entity2 were nothing new to @entity24 , including @entity29			1
complaints of delayed care were well known for years , although not all of the alarming issues raised in the most recent controversy were apparent over that time			1
still , investigations were launched , reports written , and hearings held			0
@entity29 took some action , but what came about did not fully address historic health care deficiencies at the agency			1
this all now raises fresh questions about congressional responsibilities for holding agencies accountable			0
audit : more than 120,000 veterans waiting or never got care the role of @entity29 difficulties accessing care " is something that goes way back as long as i can remember , " said @entity81 , executive director of policy and government affairs at @entity84			1
@entity29 attempted to address a host of issues plaguing the @entity2 in the 1990s			1
those reforms improved some functions and the delivery of medical care			0
but more difficulty in assessing care was an unfortunate consequence of those steps			0
the @entity2 scrambled to meet a requirement that no veteran wait longer than 30 days for care			1
the mandate was already demanding for a beleaguered @entity2 , but @entity29 also required that more veterans and more benefits be covered			1
subsequent @entity105 reports found that the agency was not able to improve health care wait times and the situation actually became worse			1
lawmakers also were generous in allocating services for veterans and even gave the va every dime it asked for			0
but that did n't seem to help either			0
wait times continued to rise			0
@entity116 , @entity117 professor and author of " why government fails so often and how it can do @entity120 , " said @entity29 could have been more effective			1
" ( @entity29 ) has failed to exercise effective oversight to require the agency to handle its caseload more efficiently , " @entity124 with the @entity125 also said lawmakers could have pushed the agency to modernize its records more quickly and instituted more robust staff reviews			2
difficult to oversee but @entity54 , who has chaired the veterans committee since 2011 and pressed for the most recent legislation , said the @entity2 has lied " over and over again , " making it difficult to oversee			1
@entity81 said the @entity2 has not been forthcoming with the @entity55 over the years , which complains it is still being stonewalled on its requests for information			1
the past five years have been the " least transparent the @entity2 has ever been , " @entity81 said			1
in a letter to acting secretary @entity135 , he accused it of stonewalling or " have possibly tried to mislead " @entity29			2
he outlined three instances in which the @entity2 has not provided information to @entity29			1
at least two @entity140 have lobbed similar assertions , including @entity143 rep. @entity142 , accusing the director of the @entity145 of being " dishonest " and lacking competence			0
@entity147 , legislative director of @entity148 and @entity149 , defended @entity29			2
he said oversight committees , especially in the @entity53 , have done a good job probing the problems but the @entity2 has been uncooperative			1
" you ca n't know what you do n't know , " @entity147 said			0
" when agency gives you false information and lies to you then it 's hard to do oversight			0
" the @entity2 said it is cooperating fully with @entity54 's panel , which continues to investigate as is the agency 's inspector general and the @entity162			2
" @entity2 respects @entity29 ' important oversight role and is committed to providing timely and accurate information , " spokeswoman @entity163 said in a statement			1
acting @entity2 leader : changes start with getting veterans appointment questions about @entity2 finances veterans groups also estimate the @entity2 also stumbled on its finances , saying it needed at least 12 % more money than it sought over the past five years for medical care			1
they said the @entity2 did not account for all of the services it provides , especially for veterans returning from the wars in @entity148 and @entity181 , and that it used overly optimistic efficiency projections that did not produce anticipated savings			2
@entity2 officials would not comment on questions about its budget			2
but @entity54 said lack of money is not the problem			0
" if money was the solution , then the problems would have been solved a long time ago , " he said			0
to its credit , noted by many amid the current uproar , the @entity2 has moved under pressure to reduce the number of homeless veterans and benefit backlogs -- key @entity1 legacies			2
the practical realities of politics are also to blame for inadequate action			0
while the @entity204 - led @entity53 has been much more active in passing legislation on a variety of veterans ' issues and the @entity140 - led @entity209 has done less , institutional structures is partly to blame			1
in the @entity53 , @entity204 can easily pass bills on its agenda despite objection from the minority			2
not so in the @entity209 , where rules give enormous power to individual members to block legislation			1
and in the overwhelmingly partisan climate , the @entity209 is where bills go to die , even proposals to help veterans			2
that happened on a major piece of legislation this past winter			0
a $ 20 billion plan to address a host of veterans ' issues went nowhere over @entity204 objections on how to pay for it -- a common @entity204 stand on federal spending proposals			2
in light of the latest accusations , however , @entity29 has acted swiftly , passing @entity2 legislation that includes a series of reforms			1
but many say it still does n't go far enough			0
@entity2 crisis : solutions exist but have n't happened , panel hears veterans groups have provided a series of proposals to immediately address the care backlog , including shifting all trained clinicians into direct provider positions and immediately triage all veterans seeking care			1
dr. @entity251 , a top official in the @entity2 health administration , acknowledged the need for major changes even beyond what @entity29 has just done			1
" today we really need to be looking at the entire structure of the organization to move forward			0
we really need to examine everything , " he said on thursday at @entity54 's hearing			0
some conservative and business quarters suggest privatizing medical services or at least opening them up to outside examination of organization and structure			0
but @entity81 said fixing the @entity2 is a lot like an onion -- so many layers			2
" and it ai n't sweet like a @entity269 , " he said			0
@entity162 launches criminal prove of @entity2			2

problems plaguing the @entity2 health system have been *ongoing* for years
government reports informed @entity29 about the depth of problems
congressional efforts to address issues were mostly inadequate
@entity53 and @entity209 passed new @entity2 legislation that requires final negotiation
