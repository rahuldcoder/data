@entity0 -- the @entity2 said wednesday authorities will not pursue criminal charges against a rap artist after he apologized for his @entity8 account 's role in causing a deluge of telephone calls into the department 's @entity12 station			1
@entity14 , whose real name is @entity14 and who also uses the name @entity19 on his @entity8 page , apologized earlier wednesday for a tweet that gave the sheriff 's station 's phone number , prompting hundreds of his followers to overwhelm deputies and dispatchers with calls			1
the sheriff 's department issued a statement in response , saying the apology was " relevant and well received			1
" " his willingness to help share with the media and the community that the safety of the public is what is most important , is a great message , " the department said			0
" based upon our investigation , as well as consultation with the @entity46 , the @entity2 considers the criminal investigation into this matter closed			2
the @entity2 will not be seeking criminal charges			1
" in issuing his apology , @entity14 said it was n't he , but a friend , who tweeted the phone number , and that it was purely an accident that the station number was tweeted			1
" it was a simple mishap , " the rapper said			2
" i was doing a photo shoot , and it was downtown @entity0 , and one of my boys picked up my phone and started tweeting random numbers			1
" whenever his phone is laying around and my phone is laying around , we tweet from each other 's page			1
that 's what happened , " the rapper said			1
the tweet on friday that gave the phone number was confused with an earlier tweet about a music internship that the rapper was offering to any of his more than 580,000 followers on his @entity8 page , @entity14 said			1
" the tweet about the internship was earlier in that day , and it got lost in the media with all that			1
he never sent out a tweet that said these numbers are for the internship			2
he tweeted a bunch of numbers jokingly			2
we always play pranks on each other , " he said			0
but @entity14 took responsibility for the early tweets about the internship			2
" we had already contacted ( the interns ) and had the interns come to the photo shoot and start working , " @entity14 said			2
" none of ( the tweets ) stated call this number for an internship			0
" the rapper added : " my sincerest apologies to the sheriff 's department , and it was a joke gone wrong			1
" sheriff 's department capt. @entity105 said authorities had considered charging @entity14 with at least three misdemeanors			1
the sheriff 's department alleged that the rapper 's tweets appeared to be listing the sheriff 's station in @entity12 as the contact number for the internship , prompting the mad rush of calls that forced the sheriff 's office to bring in additional manpower to answer phones			1
authorities said the calls lasted two hours friday evening and that help was delayed in response to urgent calls about a missing person , a spousal assault , two robberies and a stolen car			2
" i never want to be the source of anything happening wrong to anybody or anybody not being able to get through to the help lines at the police station , " @entity14 said			1
" i do n't ever want to see anyone hurt			0
i 've got kids at home			0
i 'm not that guy			0
" @entity14 said the tweets on his account listed a 10 - digit phone for the sheriff 's station : " when people are in trouble , they call 911 , and that 's not to take away from the police and them doing a job or them saying there was a robbery			1
" many residents dial a station directly with the 10 - digit number for urgent calls , even though the 911 emergency is at their disposal , a sheriff 's department spokesman said			1
the game was nominated twice in the @entity159 in 2006 : best rap song for " @entity163 , " which he wrote , and best rap performance by a duo or a group for the same song , with @entity169 , a @entity161 spokeswoman said			0
@entity14 did n't win in either category			2
@entity105 told @entity1 that the incident is a " societal " lesson			2
" people love social media and they are using it in fun and interesting ways			0
but it does n't mean that there is n't a rough edge to it , " the sheriff 's spokesman said			1
" in the past the news media was the only entity that could send a message in a fast way			0
now celebrities with social media are able to do it now too			0
all the lessons that were learned by the news media over the years about the pros and the cons ( of media ) , people with a large social media following , they are not familiar with those lessons			0
" we as a society have an interesting situation on our hands			0
we see it in flash mob activity			0
intentionally or not , challenging situations developing on a moment 's notice can occur			0
so law enforcement agencies are determining how best to monitor that without impeding people 's freedom of speech			0
" authorities are calling the incident a " telephone flash mob " or " flashcalls , " which is a sudden and overwhelming number of phone calls and is the latest riff on unlawful conduct originating from social media , @entity105 said			1
" flash mobs " began as an innocent organizing of individuals through social media to do spur - of - the - moment dances in public spaces such as a mall or a park , but increasingly , social media have been used to organize flash mobs for criminal activity , evidenced in the recent riots in @entity229 and in @entity230 , @entity231 , this year after the @entity233 loss , @entity105 said			0
the so - called flashcall or telephone flash mob is the newest twist on the trend , he said			0
" i see this as another iteration , another version of the social media phenomenon , " @entity105 said .			0

new : no criminal charges to be pursued against @entity14 , aka @entity14

the rapper says a friend used his phone to tweet " random numbers "
