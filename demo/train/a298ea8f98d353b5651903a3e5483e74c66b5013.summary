-- shortly after 1:30 p.m. on february 24 , 2010 , a @entity2 trainer lost her life in a tragic accident involving one of the park 's killer whales			1
the death of @entity9 was an occasion of almost unbearable sadness for those closest to @entity13 -- her family , friends and colleagues at @entity17			1
i was honored to know @entity13 and count myself among those @entity17 team members deeply affected by her loss			1
@entity13 's death has been the subject of thousands of articles , broadcast news stories , blogs , books , and now a feature film called " @entity29			1
" many of these accounts trade in the details of @entity13 's death in graphic detail			0
they do so not to inform but , rather , regrettably , because of the desire to sensationalize			0
filmmaker : why i made ' @entity29 ' the three years since @entity13 's death have seen the emergence of individuals who have chosen not to honor her memory , but rather to use the events of february 24 , 2010 , to advance their own interests			1
others seek to forward a political or philosophical agenda			0
still others appear to be engaged in self - promotion			0
but anyone approaching this subject in good faith must recognize a simple fact : our staff has interacted with killer whales -- for veterinary care , training , shows , educational presentations , husbandry , exercise , play and enrichment -- hundreds of times a day for nearly 50 years			0
the tragedy of @entity13 's death can not and has not been ignored , but neither should the literally millions of safe interactions we have had with killer whales over that span of time			0
" @entity29 " focuses on a handful of incidents over our long history at the exclusion of everything else			1
not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at @entity17			1
not one visitor who left @entity17 more aware of the need to preserve the world around them			1
not one word about the thousands of ill , orphaned and injured animals rescued by @entity17 or the millions of dollars we dedicate to supporting conservation and research			2
there is no acknowledgment anywhere in the film of the great things @entity17 does every day or the simple fact that our animals are healthy and passionately cared for			1
@entity17 answers @entity0 's questions on orcas i started at @entity17 in 1975 and have witnessed the growth and changes that come with a company that is dedicated to understanding these magnificent animals			1
we have collected invaluable information about these animals that could not be obtained from observation in the wild			0
in the three years since @entity13 's death , we have again made significant changes at @entity17			2
we have altered how we care for , display and train these extraordinary animals			1
we have changed the facilities , equipment and procedures at our killer whale habitats			0
the care and educational presentation of these animals at @entity17 has been made safer than ever			1
does " @entity29 " inform its viewers of that fact ? no , it does not			2
and by that omission the film reveals itself not as a work of objective documentary filmmaking , but rather as something closer to propaganda			0
as we have said many times , there is simply no higher priority for us than the safety of our guests and staff and the welfare of our animals			0
we understand that there will always be individuals and groups opposed to the care of animals in zoos and aquariums			0
we recognize that we must defend what we do and the manner in which we do it			0
@entity29 , like other works driven by the same agenda , ignores the extraordinary benefits to conservation , scientific research and education of @entity154 's zoo and aquariums			2
but through it all @entity17 remains the world 's most respected marine zoological institution			2
our parks are staffed with skilled and caring zoological professionals , all of whom deserve to have their work celebrated , not dishonored by things like " @entity29			2
" despite what the makers of this film may suggest , @entity17 is the kind of organization that draws dedicated and passionate people like @entity9			1
these are the men and women who have built @entity17 into an extraordinary place , one that provides inspiring , enriching and educational experiences to more than 11 million people each year			2
that , not the inaccurate and shamefully misleading account in " @entity29 , " is what @entity17 really is			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179			0
