he tried to warn them			0
a @entity3 researcher posted a message on @entity7 ceo @entity6 's page last week after he says the site 's security team did n't take his warnings about a security flaw seriously			1
" first , sorry for breaking your privacy and post ( ing ) to your wall , " wrote @entity12			0
" i ( have ) no other choice to make after all the reports i sent to ( the ) @entity7 team			1
" @entity12 , who describes himself as an unemployed security researcher with a degree in information systems , said he found a hole in @entity7 's systems that let him post to any user 's page , including users not on his friends list			1
such an exploit would be a virtual gold mine for spammers , scam artists and others seeking to take advantage of the site 's roughly 1 billion users worldwide			0
on his blog , @entity12 posted a series of e-mails he said were exchanged between him and @entity7 security			1
after the first one , a @entity7 employee responded that the link he attached was bad			0
@entity12 had included a post -- an @entity46 video -- he says he posted on the page of a woman who went to college with @entity6			1
he speculated that @entity7 's security team could n't see it because they were n't on her friends list			1
somebody buy @entity6 some clothes @entity7 responded to his second message to say the issue he was reporting was not a bug			1
his response : " ok that mean ( s ) i have no choice other than report this to mark himself on facebook			0
" needless to say , that got their attention			0
@entity7 says the flaw was fixed on thursday			2
but over the weekend the episode began making headlines on tech blogs			0
on the @entity72 website , @entity7 security team member @entity70 wrote that the language barrier with @entity12 , who is not a native @entity75 speaker , and the volume of reports the site receives were partly to blame for the site 's slow response			1
" unfortunately , all he submitted was a link to the post he 'd already made ( on a real account whose consent he did not have ) ... saying that ' the bug allow facebook users to share links to other facebook users , ' " @entity70 wrote			0
" for background , as a few other commenters have pointed out , we get hundreds of reports every day			0
many of our best reports come from people whose @entity75 is n't great -- though this can be challenging , it 's something we work with just fine and we have paid out over $ 1 million to hundreds of reporters			2
" because he violated @entity7 's terms of service by hacking the pages of other users , @entity12 is not eligible to receive a reward under the site 's @entity104 program designed to find and fix bugs			1
@entity12 , who says he has been looking for work for two years , lives in the @entity3 city of @entity109 , in a region where the unemployment rate is officially 22 % and is higher among men in their 20s , like @entity12			1
" i could sell ( information about the flaw ) on the black ( hat ) hackers ' websites and i could make more money than @entity7 could pay me , " he said in an interview with @entity115			2
" but for me -- i am a good guy			0
i do n't deal with the black ( hat ) stuff			0
" in hacker circles , " white hat " is a term for people who report exploits they find so they can be fixed , while " black hat " often refers to people who hack to take advantage of those exploits			0
he said he 's proud that , as a @entity3 using a five - year - old laptop with broken keys and a broken battery , he had the skills to find a problem with one of the world 's biggest websites			2
but he acknowledged hoping his tip would lead to a reward from @entity7			2
" i never asked them , ' i want $ 4,000 or $ 5,000 ' , " he said			0
" i did n't deal with them like that ...			0
( but ) i really needed that money			0
" security researcher @entity148 launched an online campaign monday to pay @entity12 the money @entity7 denied him and had raised more than $ 8,800 by early tuesday			1
" let us all send a message to security researchers across the world and say that we appreciate the efforts they make for the good of everyone , " @entity148 said on the @entity151 page			2
@entity7 's @entity70 acknowledged that the security team should have asked @entity12 for more information			1
" i have to admit that i have some sympathy with @entity7 on this issue , " security analyst @entity162 wrote on his blog			2
" although he was frustrated by the response from @entity7 's security team , @entity12 did the wrong thing by using the flaw to post a message on @entity6 's wall			1
" he would have been better served returning to @entity7 's security team with more evidence and further explaining it or , if that did n't work , taking the information to a technology journalist to report , @entity162 said .			1
