@entity5 gov. @entity57 -- a @entity11 -- has the power to appoint a replacement for @entity4 , whose current term is set to expire in 2013			1
when @entity4 entered @entity9 in january 1953 , a postage stamp cost 3 cents and @entity63 kids were clamoring for a new toy called mr. @entity65			1
@entity66 was president , @entity67 was @entity68 's prime minister , and @entity69 was still the @entity70 's leader			2
in november 2009 , two days before his 92nd birthday , @entity4 passed @entity74 democrat @entity73 's record to become the longest - serving member of @entity9			1
his health problems mounted in his later years , putting him in the hospital four times between february 2008 and september 2009			2

" if it 's the @entity116 's will , the people will send me there			0
why ? this @entity16 needs a champion , " he said before the 2006 vote			0
as the senior senator of the majority party , @entity4 served as the @entity31 's president pro tempore -- third in line of presidential succession , behind the vice president and speaker of the @entity105			1
while he set two endurance records in @entity9 , he was only proud of one in the end			0
the other was for his 1964 filibuster against the @entity132 , when he spoke for 14 hours and 13 minutes in an effort to derail the law			1
he opposed civil rights when he first ran for office , a stance he came to regret later in life			0
he blamed " that @entity144 atmosphere in which i grew up , with all of its prejudices and its feelings , " for his opposition to equal rights , which included joining the @entity141 in the 1940s			0
he called the move " the greatest mistake of my life , " an " albatross " that would always shadow his career			1
" it 's a lesson to the young people of today , that once a major mistake has been made in one 's life , " he said , " it will always be there , and it will be in my obituary			2
" @entity4 was married to his childhood sweetheart , the former @entity163 , for nearly 69 years before her death in 2006			1
" i have met queens and the wives of shahs and great women from all over the world , ( but ) to me now , this was the greatest woman i ever met in this world , " he said			2
he did not complete a college degree until 1963 , when he earned a law degree from @entity176 in @entity0 after taking night classes -- the only time a member of @entity9 has earned a law degree while holding office			0
he also received a political science degree from @entity5 's @entity182 in 1994 , at age 76			1
he rose through the @entity31 's @entity80 ranks in the 1960s , and became the chamber 's majority leader in 1977			0

in 1989 , he became chairman of the powerful @entity31 -- one of the most influential posts in @entity9 , with extensive control over the federal government 's purse strings			2
years later , @entity4 explained to @entity1 the power of that unique position			1
" in the forest there is a water hole , " he said			0
" all the animals have to come to that water hole sooner or later			0
the @entity31 is a water hole			0
" he spent the rest of his career as the panel 's chairman or ranking @entity11 , steering an estimated $ 3 billion in federal projects to @entity5 since 1991 , according to the watchdog group @entity213			1
@entity4 said he was looking out for the interests of his @entity216 constituents , nearly 20 percent of whom live below the federal poverty line			1
" my memory is as good as it ever was , and it 's stock full of recollections about the poor people of @entity5 , how they were laughed at , " he told @entity1 in 2006			1
but in the same interview , @entity4 said it was his october 2002 vote against the resolution that gave president @entity224 the authority to launch the invasion of @entity51 " of which i am most proud			1
" he was one of 23 senators to oppose the authorization , warning that @entity9 was abdicating its constitutional power to declare war by giving the president what amounted to a blank check			0
" we are rushing into war without fully discussing why , without thoroughly considering the consequences , or without making any attempt to explore what steps we might take to avert conflict , " he said			0
four months later , with an @entity63 - led army poised to move across the frontier and @entity241 weapons inspectors reporting no sign of @entity51 's suspected weapons programs , @entity4 returned to the @entity31 floor to condemn a " hauntingly silent " chamber			1
four years after casting that vote , he called the invasion " the blunder of the age			0
" though he promised to support @entity63 troops " to the last breath , the last dollar , " he told @entity1 that he and other opponents of the war had been right			0
" history will prove it was wrong to invade another country without provocation			0
that was wrong then , and it would be wrong 50 years from today , " he said			0
