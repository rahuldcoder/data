@entity0 -- the current large - scale @entity4 - @entity3 naval exercise off the west coast of @entity6 has multiple purposes			1
after last week 's @entity6 attack on a @entity3 island , the most important is to send a message to @entity11 that @entity0 and @entity12 have the capability -- and the will -- to respond with devastating force to any further acts of aggression			1
a second is to strengthen the @entity4 - @entity3 ( @entity3 ) joint capability to coordinate such a response , as well as to reinforce their anti-submarine capabilities that were so obviously inadequate last march , when @entity6 torpedoed a @entity3 naval vessel on the high seas			1
in light of the fact that past @entity6 misbehavior has not produced serious consequences for @entity11 , it may be difficult to convince the @entity6 that " this time we 're serious			0
" there was a @entity3 artillery response to the shelling last week , but it was apparently flawed in execution and did not produce much damage			2
what is needed is to credibly promise a harsh response to future attacks , yet not trigger @entity6 escalation or a preemptive war on the assumption that an effort to destroy the @entity6 is looming			2
despite its labeling the current situation an " ultra-emergency wartime situation , " the @entity6 regime is not suicidal , and one ought not assume it will take actions that will predictably bring destruction down on its head			0
but its apparent and dangerous belief that it can act with impunity has been reinforced over many years			0
it comes not only from the measured @entity3 response after the ship sinking , and from the absence of truly punishing actions after it reneged on commitments not to test intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons			2
even assassination attempts against @entity3 presidents and the blowing up of a civilian @entity3 airliner in years past produced little by way of lasting consequences for the @entity6			1
fear of precipitating a second @entity67 has proved an effective deterrent against strong @entity4 - @entity3 retaliation			1
this time , @entity0 and @entity12 seem determined not only to demonstrate the resolve to strike back ( albeit proportionately ) if necessary , but to strengthen existing un-sponsored sanctions against the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) that will effectively curtail the @entity6 's illicit activities as well as squeeze individuals in the elite structure			2
another dimension of the current exercises , which include the aircraft carrier @entity79 and its strike group , is to demonstrate to @entity81 that , its strident objections to naval operations in the @entity84 notwithstanding , the @entity4 not only has the right to operate in international waters but will do so in defense of its national interests			1
the point is not to stick a finger in @entity81 's eye ; @entity0 would far prefer to cooperate with @entity93 than to appear to challenge it in order to change @entity6 behavior			0
but the @entity4 has argued to @entity81 for a long time -- to little effect -- that its coddling of @entity11 was not producing better behavior			0
rather , it was enabling the @entity6 to pursue its contrarian ways , producing stalemate in the nuclear talks , the sinking of a @entity3 naval vessel , and now a calculated attack on a @entity3 island that killed civilians as well as military personnel			1
thus , the @entity4 message to @entity93 is : " if you can not help bring @entity6 to cease its provocative behavior , we will be forced to take actions that , while not aimed at you , will discomfit you			1
" if this leads @entity81 to more seriously strive to rein @entity6 in , all the better			0
moreover , @entity81 shrilly insisted a few months ago that no @entity4 naval exercises should take place in the @entity84 -- and especially that no aircraft carrier should enter those waters			1
in the face of that position , at some point the @entity4 had to exercise its freedom of navigation rights			0
but the choice of timing -- not ideal with a @entity81 state visit to @entity0 planned for january -- was dictated by @entity11 's actions			0
some observers say the only way to change @entity6 behavior is to engage it			0
in fact , the @entity4 is quite willing to engage the @entity6 , including in serious negotiations			1
but it is not willing to look the other way in the face of @entity11 's aggressive military behavior and its blatant violation of its most basic pledges and @entity141 resolutions regarding denuclearization			0
and it is not willing , as the @entity144 appears to want , to accept the @entity6 as a @entity146 nuclear weapons state by sitting down with @entity11 absent a demonstration by the @entity6 that it is committed to denuclearize ( even if doubts abound regarding implementation )			0
if the @entity6 does something meaningful to lower tensions with the @entity3 and to demonstrate " sincerity " about abandoning nuclear weapons , the prospects for resumed six - party denuclearization talks will improve			1
meanwhile , however , the @entity4 will continue to show strong support for its @entity3 ally to counter @entity11 's threatening actions			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			0
