-- @entity1 pushed back wednesday against a @entity3 court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students ' right to freedom of religion and education			1
the @entity10 found unanimously in november that the display of a particular religious symbol -- such as the @entity19 cross -- in a classroom " restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions , and the right of children to believe or not to believe			0
" but the court agreed in january to hear @entity1 's appeal			1
ten other @entity3 governments , dozens of @entity3 lawmakers and half a dozen nongovernmental organizations have also gotten involved in the appeal			2
the original case was brought by an @entity1 woman , @entity30 , who objected to the crucifixes on the walls in her two sons ' classrooms			1
she fought her way through the @entity1 legal system starting in 2001 , arguing that she wanted to raise her children as secular , according to court documents			1
@entity1 courts ruled earlier that the cross was a symbol of @entity1 's history and culture , prompting @entity30 to take her case to the @entity3 court in @entity46 , @entity47			1
it awarded her 5,000 euros ( $ 7,400 ) in damages in november			0
the court does not have the power to force @entity1 to take down the representations of @entity53 on the cross , but if its ruling stands and @entity1 does not comply , the door would be open for others to sue on the same grounds , said court spokesman @entity58			1
only @entity1 would be directly affected by the ruling if it loses the case , but all 47 countries that belong to the @entity65 " might draw consequences from such a judgment , " court spokesman @entity59 added			1
it could take the court six months to a year to rule , he said			1
leading @entity69 figures expressed astonishment and anger at the ruling last year			2
the @entity1 @entity72 called it " cause for bitterness and many perplexities			2
" " it does not take into account the fact that in @entity1 the display of the crucifix in public places is in line with the recognition of the principles of @entity69 as ' part of the historical patrimony of the @entity1 people , ' as stated in the @entity91 / @entity1 agreement of 1984 , " the bishops said in a written statement			2
cardinal @entity92 told the leading @entity1 daily @entity93 he could not understand it , and that no one with common sense could have expected it			2
" when i think that we are talking about a symbol , the crucifix , an image that can not but be the emblem of a universally shared humanity , i not only feel disappointed but also sadness and grief , " he said			0
" the crucifix is the sign of a @entity105 that loves man to the point of giving up his life for him			0
it is a @entity105 that teaches us to learn to love , to pay attention to each man ... and to respect the others , even those who belong to a different culture or religion			0
how could someone not share such a symbol ? " seventeen judges heard the appeal wednesday			0
the governments of @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 are also involved in the appeal , the court said			0
the @entity10 was set up in @entity46 by the @entity65 member @entity134 in 1959 to deal with alleged violations of the 1950 @entity137			0
@entity0 's @entity138 in @entity139 contributed to this report .			0
