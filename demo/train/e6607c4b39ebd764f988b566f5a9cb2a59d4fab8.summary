-- it 's the innovation hotbed deep in the heart of @entity3 , the town where the tech and web world 's movers , shakers and up - and - comers descend every spring to learn , network and party at @entity11			1
now , @entity12 , @entity3 , is showing off an emerging startup scene some hope will make it the @entity15 of the @entity16			1
more than 700 people gathered tuesday in @entity12 for the city 's inaugural @entity19 demo day			1
at its best , such a demo can give people a brief glimpse into the future of tech , and this event , coupled with @entity12 's scene , did not disappoint			1
in return for a 6 % stake in the startups , many of which had moved to the @entity3 capital to participate in the three - month program , the highly competitive @entity19 gave these new companies access to a huge network of mentors , a downtown @entity12 office space and $ 18,000 in seed funding			1
out of 800 applicants , only 10 were accepted			1
" the goal is to make this a fantastic place to start companies , " program manager @entity42 said			1
" if you want to help , dig in			1
help them find investors , employees , office space			1
" tuesday was graduation day , with dozens of t - shirt - clad founders preparing to lay it all on the line in their quest for investment dollars that would allow them to take their businesses to the next level			1
the @entity60 was filled with media , mentors and -- most importantly to the startups -- hundreds of potential investors			1
here 's a look at five of our favorites : filament labs it makes a health care app designed to help doctors and nurses engage with patients who have chronic medical conditions			2
we 've all left the doctor 's office with a folder of homework -- information to read , exercises to do , foods to eat and certain biometrics to monitor			2
and most of us either lose the folder or ignore the advice			2
the @entity68 app is customizable by your health care provider to keep the information on your mobile device specific to you			2
it 's designed to make tracking symptoms of your condition easier and keep communication lines open			2
if it works , you take better care of yourself , your doctor has a clearer understanding of how you 're managing your condition , and you stay healthy			2
@entity102 many believe the future of manufacturing lies in 3 - d printing for the masses			2
right now , there are hundreds of small - to medium - size @entity110 printing shops nationwide with big dreams but limited pipelines			2
@entity102 aims to change that			0
here 's how it works : currently if a consumer places a last - minute order for 1,000 widgets to be delivered next week , a small company ca n't deliver in time			1
so , it either disappoints a customer or ca n't compete for the business to begin with			0
@entity102 attacks this problem by networking the small manufacturers into a virtual conglomerate that allows them to share resources , outsource large orders and scale up manufacturing quickly			1
@entity130 nothing kills a company 's reputation like software that does n't work right			1
but as @entity130 founder @entity137 puts it , " testing is f * * * ing hard			0
" she aims to change that by giving companies easy access to the best mobile app beta - testers around			0
@entity130 has created a network of more than 1,200 professional testers that can be hired to use , abuse and find all the bugs in a mobile app before bringing it to market			0
@entity150 there 's nothing hotter right now than wearable tech , and the @entity150 wristband was probably the coolest piece of hardware on display tuesday			0
the device is targeted at the exercise marketplace , a field dominated by companies such as @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164			0
ceo @entity165 and co-founders had tried all the gadgets on the market and said they found them to be no more than glorified pedometers -- fun to use for a few weeks but eventually relegated to the sock drawer			0
for @entity165 , " the data you got was limited -- steps were n't enough			0
" leveraging multiple sensors and advanced algorithms , @entity150 has created a device that can differentiate between a whole host of exercises			0
to demonstrate , the company brought a fitness model on to the stage and showed the @entity150 successfully keeping track of everything from biceps curls to squat thrusts			0
gone keeping with the demo day tradition of casual profanity , gone ceo @entity188 sums up his company 's mission succinctly			1
" i 'm going to help you get rid of the sh * t you do n't need anymore , " he said			0
the product takes @entity197 's sell - anything ethos and couples it with @entity199 's ease of use and speedy shipping			0
simply take a picture of something you want to get rid of , and @entity205 says it will automatically find the right marketplace to sell it			0
the company then makes an offer and , if you like it , it will send a prepaid box for shipping			0
the company also partners with donation and recycling centers in case no one wants to buy what you 're selling			0
@entity188 said that around two - thirds of items in the marketplace get sold while one - third end up being donated			0
either way , @entity205 says , your home will end up less cluttered			0
the demo day came to a close with seats , the program manager , exhorting the audience to do more than passively watch the show			1
he moved to @entity12 this year to manage the @entity19 program , and he wants these new businesses to put down roots in his new home .			1

@entity19 demo day focused on @entity12 , @entity3 , startups this week
the program offered work space , seed money and networking in @entity12
in exchange , the program gets a 6 % stake in the startup
