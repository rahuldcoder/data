@entity0 -- on sunday we commemorate the courage and sacrifice of 600 men and women who dared 45 years ago to take the first steps in a 54 - mile march from @entity9 , @entity10 , to the state capital , @entity12 , for the right to vote			1
that day , sunday , march 7 , 1965 , would come to be known as " @entity14			1
" as these unarmed civil rights patriots attempted to cross the @entity17 in @entity9 , where fewer than one percent of eligible black voters were allowed to register , they were gassed and beaten with billy clubs by state and local police , some on horseback , ordered to break up the demonstration			1
captured by television cameras and broadcast nationwide , the suffering of these nonviolent activists , 50 of whom required hospitalization , awoke the nation 's consciousness to the importance of voting rights and the entire civil rights movement			1
within 10 days , president @entity33 would send a bill to @entity35 , the @entity36 , that would outlaw the discriminatory @entity38 - era practices that had long worked to disenfranchise african - americans and other minorities across the @entity39			2
forty - five years later , the right for which marchers in @entity10 bled remains out of reach for many @entity39			2
in many states , minority voters encounter obstacles at every step of the voting process , from registration to casting a ballot			1
last month , voting rights advocates filed suit against @entity54 state election officials , following the advocates ' investigation of rejected voter registration applications in 2008 from students at historically @entity60 @entity59 and the state officials ' subsequent refusal to make certain voter registration records publicly available			1
while @entity54 was rejecting minority voter registrations in 2008 , @entity64 was purging voters from its registration rolls			1
earlier this year , @entity64 settled a lawsuit brought by @entity69 and other voting rights advocates			2
as a result of the @entity64 suit , usage of lists of purged voters was stayed and the approximately 31,000 voters illegally removed from the registration lists were permitted to cast provisional ballots in the 2008 presidential election			2
forty - five years after @entity14 , another march is under way , but it aims to turn back the clock on voting rights			2
last month , the @entity84 passed legislation to require voters to show a photo id before casting a ballot -- a measure that disproportionately excludes low - income , minority , elderly , and student voters , all of whom are less likely than majority voters to have ready access to a government - issued photo id			2
meanwhile , @entity100 's secretary of state has vowed to bring a federal court challenge after the @entity39 @entity102 rejected the state 's proposed voter " verification " program to identify registrants who may not be citizens			0
the @entity102 analysis of the program condemned it as highly inaccurate in identifying noncitizens and concluded that it would have a discriminatory effect on minority voters			1
moreover , on thursday officials in @entity114 continued their fight to salvage that state 's photo id law in arguments to the state 's @entity119 , after an appellate court held that the law violates equal protection under the state constitution			0
proponents of photo id and citizenship verification laws claim these measures are needed to protect against voter fraud			0
the problem with that argument is that they can not point to any reliable evidence that fraud is a problem			0
all credible research and expert analysis demonstrates that voter fraud is , at best , extremely rare			0
and in - person voter fraud -- someone registering to vote as @entity140 and then showing up at the polls claiming to be mr. @entity140 -- simply does not exist			0
these laws are solutions searching for a problem , with what some may describe as the unintended consequence of disenfranchising the most vulnerable voters			0
in some cases , however , disenfranchising voters is precisely the intended consequence			0
for example , the @entity151 just appealed a federal court 's order to keep in place a 28 - year - old consent agreement that prohibited the @entity151 from engaging in " security programs " that have had a disproportionate impact on minorities at the ballot box			0
the @entity151 consented to the agreement in 1982 to settle a lawsuit alleging that its so - called security measures -- such as stationing armed off - duty law enforcement officers at minority voting locations and aggressively challenging the rights of eligible minority voters to cast a ballot -- were actually voter intimidation tactics			1
unable to identify a single instance of in - person voter fraud , the @entity151 instead argued , in part , that because the president of the @entity39 and the @entity39 attorney general are @entity60 , it is more likely that the government will enforce laws that safeguard against disenfranchising minority voters			1
in an effort to show their intentions are good , @entity151 lawyers note that the committee 's chairman , @entity181 , is african - american			0
the fact is , voting patterns continue to split along racial and party lines			0
exit polls from the 2008 presidential election show that while 95 percent of african - americans , 67 percent of @entity191 , and 62 percent of @entity192 voted for @entity193 nationally , only 43 percent of whites did			0
as the federal judge noted in this case , the @entity151 " has been largely unsuccessful in its efforts to attract minority voters			1
" so long as these patterns endure , the @entity151 will continue to have what the judge termed an " incentive " to engage in racially motivated voter suppression			0
there is no doubt that we have come a long way since @entity14			0
sadly , however , there is also no doubt that the need to fight for voting rights continues			2
instead of going back to a dark era of our history by putting needless obstacles in front of minority voters , @entity35 and the states should press ahead to break down the remaining barriers that block eligible voters from exercising their constitutional rights			1
we should start by modernizing the voter registration system by making it more automated and keeping eligible voters on the rolls permanently			1
we should take voting out of the artificial confines created by a limited and literal " @entity227 " by providing for universal early voting			1
to live up to our constitutional mandate to continue to form a more perfect union -- and to truly honor the brave men and women who marched and were beaten and bloodied , and especially those who were murdered defending their right to vote -- we have the duty to ensure that every eligible voter has an equal and meaningful opportunity to cast a ballot and have it counted			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			0

on march 7 , 1965 , civil rights marchers were beaten by police in @entity9 , @entity10
the protests helped lead to passage of the @entity36
@entity241 says minority voters still face obstacles to casting their ballots
@entity241 : voter registration should be modernized ; early voting should be available to all
