her case asked the judges to tell her at what point her husband would be breaking the law if she committed suicide with his help			1
" i 'm not prepared for @entity10 to break the law , " she said			0
" how can we make sure that we act within the law without potential prison sentences if they wo n't tell us under what circumstances they would prosecute ? " the suicide act says only that anyone who " aids , abets , counsels or procures the suicide of another , or an attempt by another to commit suicide , shall be liable " to be jailed for as long as 14 years			2
" what does this actually mean , and how is the discretion to prosecute actually exercised ? " said @entity53 , a spokeswoman for @entity54 , a charity that has worked on @entity16 's case			0
" does it mean booking tickets ? getting medical records ? pushing somebody 's wheelchair on a plane ? do these matters amount to a criminal offense ?

she is still able to do normal activities like cooking , cleaning and shopping , but she knows her physical condition is rapidly deteriorating			0
if her case is not resolved , @entity16 said she may decide to go alone to @entity81 and commit suicide while she is still able to on her own			0
she said she would prefer making that journey much later , only once her condition deteriorates , so she can die with her husband by her side			0
" i 'll have to make a decision , " she said			0
" i 'm not prepared for @entity10 to face potential jail , because if they wo n't tell us in advance ( that ) he can do @entity111 , @entity112 , and z without risk of prosecution , i ca n't risk that			0
