-- @entity1 has landed some hard punches against the drug cartels that have stirred violence in parts of the country -- at least on paper			1
in 2011 , against just the notorious @entity9 cartel , @entity1 ended the reign of 16 leaders who ran cartel operations at the state or national level			1
thugs with nicknames like " @entity17 , " " @entity18 " and " @entity19			0
" but the violence attributed to the @entity9 has not decreased even after these busts , and critics wonder if names are meaningless if they are so quickly replaced			2
and a majority of @entity1 's most - wanted drug traffickers , 22 out of 37 , have been put out of commission , but to what benefit ? at what cost ? " @entity1 has paid an enormous price : almost 50,000 dead , almost $ 50 billion in additional security costs , ever more numerous human rights violations , ( and ) a great discrediting of the country to the world , " wrote @entity29 , a former @entity1 foreign minister and critic of the current strategy , in the @entity33 newspaper @entity32			1
@entity1 president @entity40 , and his backers in the @entity43 government , meanwhile , insist that the militarized offensive is paying dividends and that a turning point is close at hand			1
taking stock of the successes and failures of @entity1 's drug war means examining a strategy that experts are divided over			1
it is a strategy that is not static , and there is evidence that the @entity1 government is -- if not gaining ground -- at least reshaping the battlefield			1
the strategy the entry of @entity1 troops into the drug cartel fight began before @entity40 became president			1
his predecessor , @entity65 , launched @entity66 in 2005 , which sent soldiers and federal police to eight cities in @entity1			1
according to @entity1 scholar @entity71 , @entity65 was reluctant to take this step , and tried to limit its scope			1
( today , @entity75 is a critic of the war and advocates the decriminalization of drugs			0
) when @entity40 took office the following year after a victory by the smallest of margins , he embraced the military approach			2
just 11 days after being sworn in , he sent troops to his home state of @entity87 , and in the following months to a number of other states			0
as many as 45,000 troops have been deployed throughout the country			2
five years later in january 2012 , in a @entity93 's message to the @entity1 people , @entity40 admitted that insecurity remains one of the biggest worries for citizens			1
" that 's why my government has worked with great firmness on this task , and we have done it with a comprehensive vision , " he said			0
" we are combating from the roots a problem that grew during many , many years			0
we have acted with a firm decision to put a stop to those who hurt @entity1 , honest and hardworking , like i know you and your family are			1
" the years of military involvement has not stopped the number of violent deaths from growing			2
the government has released only a partial death toll for 2011 , which is expected to set a new record			0
the good news , the government said , is that the rate at which the killings were growing has slowed down considerably			0
@entity122 is the centerpiece , but not the only component of the strategy			2
@entity40 has committed resources to cleaning up corruption among all levels of police forces , and wants to strengthen the institutions that apply the law , such as the attorney general 's office			0
the @entity43 has aided through the $ 1.4 billion @entity133 , which gave the @entity1 @entity134 , but also training for police , prosecutors and defenders			1
measuring success in the early stages of the offensive , @entity1 's secretary of defense , @entity140 , expressed the goal of the campaign as this : " to provide the level of security that can make viable citizen 's life			1
" if it is true that this level of security exists in most of @entity1 , it is also true that most of @entity1 has not suffered the drug violence up close			1
as the government points out , the violence is limited to certain regions , like the border states of @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , or in @entity160 , the cradle of a cartel of the same name			1
do @entity1 enjoy a " viable " life there ? drug cartels have branched out into kidnapping , extortion , human smuggling and suppression of the media			1
and residents in those hotspots where the cartels operate continue to live under these conditions			0
@entity140 himself , in a speech this month , admitted that the security of @entity1 " finds itself seriously threatened			1
" in some areas , security forces find themselves overrun by the traffickers , he said			0
" in some regions of the country , organized crime has overtaken state institutions , and once empowered , diversified their ominous activities to deprive society of its rights , generating a climate of unprecedented violence , " he said			1
in those same areas , though , slowdowns in violence are evidence that sending in the military does have an impact , said @entity198 , director of the @entity199 at the @entity200			1
" i think the government overstates its case often , but there is progress , " he said			2
indeed , some of the major cartels , such as the @entity207 and the @entity209 cartel , are shadows of their former selves			2
@entity40 's offensive has succeeded in disrupting the command and control of the major cartels , he said			0
the cartels are less cohesive than they once were , and the violence , while still present , is more decentralized , he said			2
the threat from the cartels is gradually shifting from a national security threat to a public security issue , he said			0
toward victory ? @entity1 has made such strides that it 's not impossible to imagine that " they actually might get every major trafficker at some point , " @entity198 said			1
" the glass is half full			0
" @entity228 , intelligence director for the @entity229 , agreed			0
" first and foremost , they have achieved unprecedented successes in apprehending those higher - level leaders and associates in all of the cartels operating in @entity1 , " he said			1
" i believe that it 's heading in a direction where you will start to see violence drifting down			2
" @entity1 is still building up capacities such as police and investigator competence , but the fruits of their efforts are evident , he said			1
" i believe their ability to target , to arrest , to develop intelligence have improved , " he said			0
in the past , distrust has been an obstacle to @entity43 - @entity1 cooperation , but @entity228 said , robust intelligence sharing has resulted in many of the high - level captures			1
" it is moving in the right direction , and i believe it will bear dividends in the future , " he said			0
the office of @entity40 declined numerous requests by @entity0 to elaborate on their strategy or view of success			2
such upbeat assessments have not won over many @entity1 , however			1
in november , a group of activists filed a 700 - page complaint with the @entity268 against the @entity1 government , alleging more than 470 cases of human rights violations against women and children			1
that same month , @entity274 released a report that found a growing number of human rights violation allegations that were not adequately investigated			0
the @entity1 strategy has " exacerbated a climate of violence , lawlessness , and fear in many parts of the country , " the report found			1
poet @entity286 , who has become a leading activist against the military campaign , garnered enough clout that @entity40 sat down to meet with his group			2
@entity286 's movement calls for ending the military approach altogether , and to focus on the social impacts of the fight			2
obstacles remain " it is naive to think you can win a drug war			0
the best you can do is manage it , " said @entity299 , professor of government at the @entity301 and expert of drug cartels			0
the current military strategy is not working , because the most important sectors of @entity1 society have not gotten behind it , he said			1
the powerful elite in the country -- whether politically , economically or intellectually -- have not felt firsthand the effects of the violence and have not had the " epiphany " that it is a problem that must be confronted , @entity299 said			1
with the second - and mid-tier arrests , it is too easy for the cartels to replace those figures			0
that 's where @entity1 sees groups like the @entity9 replenish themselves even after a year of tough losses in several plazas , or territories			2
" their plaza chiefs are like utility infielders -- you can put them in any place and at any time , " @entity299 said			0
real change -- real success -- will be achieved only when the top kingpins are taken down , and that will take pressure from all of the country 's elite on the government to act , he said			2
" those with power have not committed themselves to fighting this war , " @entity299 said			0
whatever side of the debate @entity1 fall on , is it possible that a military approach was inevitable ? @entity71 , the @entity1 expert , wrote about the options that @entity40 had available to him when he came to office amid rising cartel violence			1
tolerance was an option , but the cartels were becoming so powerful that it would have put democracy at risk , he argued			0
there exists the option of legalizing drugs , an idea with growing appeal to many			0
this is possible in theory , @entity71 writes , but politically impossible in the short term			0
a third option is to strengthen institutions			0
this is actually part of the current strategy , but it is a time - consuming process			0
the final option left was a frontal military assault , with knowledge that it would bring violence as a cost , @entity71 wrote			2
it is an election year , @entity40 's final year at the helm			0
these options will be before a new president , likely from a different party			0
he will have to decide : have the costs outweighed the benefits .			0

@entity1 has used its military to help capture cartel leaders
violence continues in parts of the country
voices of *opposition* to the strategy have been getting louder
experts say some progress has been made
