the @entity1 jihadi group @entity0 grabbed headlines at the weekend when it released a video urging muslims living in the @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 to launch terrorist attacks against high - profile shopping malls -- including the @entity11 in @entity12			1
so , why the threat now ? and how worried should we be ? the answer to the first question is easy			0
@entity0 is trying to get attention			1
@entity0 desperately needed such attention for two reasons			1
for a start , it has been entirely overshadowed by the violent extremist group the @entity21 over the past year			0
the fact is that @entity21 is garnering virtually all of the media coverage of extremists , and as a result is attracting virtually all the recruits and money from the patrons of violent extremism			0
this has left jihadi groups like @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity0 struggling to reclaim some of the spotlight from their new " rival , " and a call to attack @entity39 shopping malls was a chance to earn some easy headlines while also trying to burnish international credentials that were badly tarnished in 2012 when it suffered a bloody internal purge that killed off some of its most prominent foreign leaders and disheartened former supporters			1
but @entity0 also had a potential marketing problem on its hands with the release of a new propaganda video , " the @entity52 : @entity53			1
" that 75 - minute long video was an uninspired tirade against the @entity57 government that said nothing the group had not claimed many times before			2
it was far too long and doomed to be ignored			0
by tacking on a call in the final minute of the film for @entity5 in the @entity64 to attack shopping malls -- and then naming specific targets -- the producers guaranteed that their otherwise forgettable video would get global headlines			1
it was a clever marketing move			0
does @entity0 have a legitimate grievance against the three countries it singled out ? of course , these governments all support the @entity74 and the @entity76 peacekeeping forces in @entity1 , both of which are fighting against @entity0			1
the @entity6 , moreover , has launched a number of drone and missile attacks against @entity0 , killing their leader @entity81 in 2014			1
some would view this as justification for @entity0 to " take the war to the @entity64			1
" but the reality is that many dozens of countries , from @entity88 to the @entity89 to @entity90 , give robust support to the @entity74 and assist it in the fight against @entity0			2
the reason @entity0 singled out these three countries is therefore more venal -- those are the three nations with the highest concentrations of @entity1 diaspora members			2
so , how worried should we be if this was mostly a marketing ploy ? exactly as worried as we were before the video was released			2
the threat of " lone wolf " terrorism -- a single individual who is inspired to commit an act of terrorism in the name of a radical cause -- has long been a major homeland security concern			0
for years , violent extremist groups such as @entity21 , @entity33 of the @entity111 and @entity0 have been calling on @entity5 living in the @entity64 to wage jihad against the unbelievers on their home soil			1
for example , the former leader of @entity116 , a @entity6 - born cleric named @entity118 , gained notoriety for a cover article in his english - language " @entity124 " magazine entitled " how to make a bomb in @entity126			0
" likewise , in a 2013 video , @entity0 called on @entity5 in the @entity64 " to grab whatever you 've got " to attack non-muslims			1
despite such calls to action , though , the good news is that very few @entity5 citizens in the @entity64 have paid any attention to these calls to war			2
@entity0 's 2013 video failed to inspire any known acts of violence , and its current video will probably meet the same fate			1
moreover , the plea to individual " holy warriors " to launch attacks is an implicit admission that @entity0 lacks the network of operatives to conduct a planned terrorist attack itself			1
the bad news is that lone wolf attacks are difficult or even impossible for law enforcement to track and prevent			0
in every country in the world , a small percentage of deeply troubled , angry , and impressionable individuals are susceptible to calls to political violence			0
@entity159 just suffered from a fatal act of terrorism by a lone - wolf attacker with no radical @entity164 links but who was seized with uncontrolled anger at @entity159 society			0
the 2013 @entity169 bombings were allegedly planned and executed by two self - radicalized @entity171 brothers			0
we can and should reduce the threat of homegrown terrorism , but we will never be able to stop it entirely			0
@entity176 , which homeland security secretary @entity177 called for after the @entity0 threat , is entirely appropriate			2
but vigilance must not be an excuse for overreaction			0
after all , an overreaction is exactly what the jihadists are hoping to provoke .			0
