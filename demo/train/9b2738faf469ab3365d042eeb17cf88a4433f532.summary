the review team , led by @entity25 adm. @entity24 , was charged with determining accountability for the shipment			1
the announcement of the accountability findings was made to reporters at a @entity32 news conference thursday by acting @entity3 secretary @entity11 and air force chief of staff gen. @entity12			2
both men were involved in deciding what action each officer would face			2
" we carefully evaluated the evidence , both that which we derived from the @entity24 report and other documentation , associated documentation			0
and we came to the conclusion on what the appropriate sanctions were , " according to @entity12			0
" there is a differentiation of sanction involved for these individuals			0
and some are significantly more serious than others , " he said			0

two other generals had already filed for retirement before they received letters of admonishment , according to the statement			1
two other generals receiving less severe letters of admonishment will remain in their command			1
because of their level of knowledge and understanding of nuclear weapons and command issues , they are considered vital to their missions , according to @entity12			1
" they have unique skills and capacity to serve			0
and we came to the conclusion , after a careful evaluation , that we could place our respective trust in their continued service , " he said			0
" they certainly are on notice that there is no room for error here and that , should they abuse this trust , it wo n't take but about a millisecond to react			0
