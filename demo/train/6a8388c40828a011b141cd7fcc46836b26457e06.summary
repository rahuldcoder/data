@entity0 -- by now , @entity3 merrymakers have packed away the decorations and may even have paid off their holiday shopping sprees			1
but while the rest of us have moved on to @entity9 , @entity6 is still surrounded by glittery @entity3 ornaments			1
since the end of september , @entity6 said , the showroom she manages has been a veritable glitter explosion			2
she works at @entity14 by @entity15 , a wholesale showroom in @entity0 's @entity17 , and last month she presided over the store 's 2011 debut of over 7,000 holiday decorations			1
every january , retailers from all over the world flock to @entity17 for the eight - day holiday shopping frenzy called the @entity24			1
more than 4,500 exhibiting wholesalers within @entity17 's three city blocks show off their wares to visiting shop owners			1
it 's the kickoff to a year 's worth of holiday shopping for boutiques , gift stores , florists , interior decorators and chain stores			2
so what can consumers expect to finally see in local shops , many months from now ? " there 's a real trend towards vintage ornaments this year , " said @entity40 , a buyer for the @entity42 in @entity43 , @entity44			1
" we 're seeing a lot of retro ones , back to @entity51 and even 1950s and ' 60s			2
there 's a lot of people going back to the traditional @entity3 look ( more ) than they have the past few years			1
" " the trends that i 'm seeing for this year that are different are the mixed colors , " said @entity56 , owner and buyer for @entity59 's flowers in @entity60 , @entity61			1
" like , really bright			1
i think people want to be festive and happy			0
they want that bright colorfulness ( to ) bring into their home			1
" whimsical @entity3 ornaments have been popular at @entity69 , said the wholesale store 's owner , @entity70			1
" it 's traditional red and white with hints of lime green			0
that lime green has really become one of the traditional colors for @entity3			1
everything that it 's on , it just pops			0
" @entity82 , the showroom manager for wholesaler @entity83 , said their line of peacockish blues and greens was a particular favorite of stores in @entity90			0
she said icicles and anything with a snowy look were popular with wedding planners for winter nuptials			0
@entity97 area stores and large aquariums will likely carry some of @entity14 by @entity15 's " @entity103 " line , which features whimsical fish and bright @entity102 colors , said @entity6			1
another of the company 's lines , " @entity109 , " is popular in the @entity107 and @entity108 , she said			0
wholesalers like @entity111 , the president of @entity14 by @entity15 , recently finished a year 's worth of work designing ornaments , overseeing the manufacturing process and fulfilling clients ' orders			1
and now they 're starting all over again			0
" most of our product is hand - produced , " @entity111 said , noting that all the company 's glass ornaments are blown by artisans , not machine - made			1
all the glitter on the ornaments is painted on by hand , added @entity6			1
" the production times are significant			0
so by taking orders in january , we ship ( the holiday merchandise ) in proper time for the retailers to get it in time to show for @entity3 , " @entity111 said			1
like many wholesale companies , @entity14 by @entity15 goes overseas to design its decor lines and have the ornaments manufactured , @entity134 said			1
her husband , @entity139 , and son @entity140 run their 62 - year - old family business			2
" it 's a long trip " to design the ornaments with the factories , she said			2
" they work seven days a week , and they 're gone for five weeks and change			0
" once the designing and manufacturing is done , the merchandise has to travel back to the @entity152 by boat , she said			0
" we start delivering in may and june			0
people want their orders from may through november , because they have to get the merchandise into their stores , into their stockrooms			0
" and while all that work is happening for the current year 's holiday shipments , wholesalers are already thinking a year ahead			2
" right now we 're already thinking about items for christmas 2012 , " said @entity162 , the vice president of @entity83			0
" we 've just gotten through the big shows , and we see the trends and we see what people are asking for , and we actually start thinking about it and putting our basic thoughts down right now			0
" they send the next year 's artwork and manufacturing directions to factories starting in june , @entity162 said			0
in july and august , his company will send people overseas to start working with the factories , finalizing their 2012 ornaments and decorations in september and october			2
it usually takes between 90 and 120 days to manufacture a wholesaler 's line of products , @entity162 said			0
many wholesalers choose to go to @entity184 factories to manufacture their ornament lines			2
those 90 to 120 days encompass gathering raw materials and wooing a skilled workforce away from steadier jobs in computer manufacturing , he said			0
once the merchandise is made , the wholesalers send sample ornaments to their showrooms , which , by october , are being decorated for the next @entity24			1
it often takes three months to completely decorate a showroom			2
by comparison , it 's relatively easy for the average consumer to choose from a dizzying array of shiny ornaments in a store			2
according to @entity70 , shoppers did so with enough verve last holiday season to deplete a lot of the inventory that boutiques had been holding on to			0
@entity70 said for the last two years , many of the retailers visiting her store have been nervous about the economy			1
instead of buying a lot of new merchandise at @entity17 , they 've been stocking shelves with ornaments left over from previous years			1
" a lot of our customers , whether small or large , indicated that the fourth quarter @entity3 sales were outstanding , so they were able to deplete a lot of that inventory , " she said			1
and now those boutiques and specialty stores are ready to replenish their stock			0
" generally , my budget is several thousand dollars for each showroom , and so far i 've been doing my job , " said @entity56 , the @entity61 flower shop owner , as she looked around the @entity227			0
" for us , we usually spend around $ 20,000 every time we come in january , and about $ 15,000 when we come back in july			0
" @entity56 said this was her 16th year coming to the market			0
" i 'm wearing very comfortable shoes , because it 's like a marathon , " said @entity40 , the buyer for the @entity236 .			2

retailers buy @entity3 ornaments 11 months in advance
wholesalers create the ornaments 2 years in advance
the @entity249 is " like a marathon " for buyers
@entity3 2011 will bring vintage - feeling ornaments as well as bright , whimsical colors
