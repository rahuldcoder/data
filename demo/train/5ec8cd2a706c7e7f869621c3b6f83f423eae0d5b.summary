-- remember the @entity1 ? silly question -- you 're old enough to read , so they probably helped teach you			1
back when i was kid , they were huge			0
" @entity9 " ran five seasons , 1976 - 1981 , and spawned half a dozen film spin - offs			2
the first @entity1 movie ( " more entertaining than humanly possible ! " ) boasted cameos by @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- not to mention @entity18 -- a bill that positioned @entity20 and company as the natural heirs to a half - century or more of prime - time vaudeville shtick			1
but the brand has fallen into neglect , and it 's entirely possible that an otherwise pop savvy 10 - year - old would n't know his @entity28 from his @entity29			1
( " @entity31 the frog ? " my son guessed , when i asked him to name one			0
" and is n't there a pig ? " ) catch up with @entity20 and @entity35 enter @entity36 , who fessed up to a fetish for singing puppets in " @entity40 " and who has taken up the challenge of making @entity44 's fabric - and - thread creations relevant to today 's digital generation			1
@entity36 , who stars and co-wrote ( with " @entity40 " director @entity46 ) , grabs the bull by the horns , so to speak , by acknowledging that the @entity1 ' glory days are long gone			1
that strategy risks making this comeback vehicle too much of a nostalgia trip to entice the kiddies , but their parents will probably lap it up			0
@entity57 and @entity58 are brothers , and inseparable ; except that @entity57 ( @entity36 ) is flesh and blood , and @entity58 ... well , let 's just say there 's a reason why @entity58 's favorite show is " the @entity1			1
" when @entity57 invites his girlfriend @entity67 ( @entity68 ) for a romantic getaway to @entity70 , it 's only natural that he would invite @entity58 along too : for as long as they both can remember , it 's been @entity58 's dream to visit the @entity74			2
but when they get there , the building is dilapidated and on the verge of falling into the hands of an unscrupulous oilman , @entity79 ( @entity79 )			0
the only way to save it is to persuade @entity20 to round up the old gang and put on a telethon : a comeback comedy special			2
it 's not exactly a fresh idea , but @entity36 and debut director @entity86 ( " @entity87 " ) amuse themselves -- and us -- by poking fun at the cornball conventions of movie musicals : when @entity67 breaks into a melancholy ballad , the sudden downpour on her window pane does n't come from the heavens , but a gardener 's hose			1
a song - and - dance routine involving the entire population of " @entity102 " climaxes in the citizens collapsing into a heap , exhausted			0
in fact , this early showstopper -- " life 's a @entity107 " -- is easily the pick of the new tunes , an infectiously jaunty number written by " @entity87 ' " @entity112			0
too many of the rest are strictly novelty items , including an intentionally awful barbershop rendition of " @entity116 " and @entity79 rapping , badly			0
" man or @entity1 , " which is supposed to reflect the identity crisis of the two brothers , does n't make much sense in the circumstances			2
we can see pretty clearly which is which and where the 2 - foot hand puppet really belongs			0
i hate to be a party pooper			0
at its best , this is a bright , colorful , perfectly innocuous amusement , but it 's also pretty slapdash and disappointingly sluggish			0
@entity130 and @entity131 worked this line of parodic faux innocence better in " @entity134 " 25 years ago ( so did @entity68 in " enchanted " )			0
@entity36 has n't given himself enough to do as @entity57 , whose defining characteristic is neglecting @entity67 -- and if you 're going to go to the trouble of inventing a new @entity1 ( @entity58 ) , why make him a bland nonentity ? as for the show 's true stars , @entity20 and @entity35 , it 's nice to have them back , but i have to say they 've never had the same spark since original voice artists @entity44 and @entity145 passed the baton to @entity147 and @entity148			1
@entity35 , in particular , is a pale shadow of the psychotic diva she used to be -- just do n't tell that to @entity152 , the guest star she kidnaps and , uh , hogties when no other celebrity volunteers for the telethon			1
a mixed bag then : " the @entity1 " is n't the best or the worst of @entity20 's big - screen capers			1
at least it 's a reminder that here 's one frog who is n't about to croak .			2
