-- @entity2 's @entity1 lays out the city 's most avoidable attractions ... and what you should do instead			1
do n't ... get lit in @entity7 @entity7 is home to several bars that drunken tourists in green face paint love to frequent			1
there are lovely things to see in historic @entity7 -- for example , the @entity15 , the @entity16 and the @entity17 -- but save your tour for the daytime , before things get pagan			2
tie one on like the locals @entity25 to the area around @entity27 in @entity28 or make your way down towards @entity31			0
4 @entity32 and @entity33 for your clubbing clusterfreaks ; the @entity35 , the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 for your beer and @entity40 matches			0
those in search of the dirty singles scene might entertain the idea of hitting @entity45 -- a local institution , described in disgusted tones by my @entity49 friends as " a meatmarket , " " full of nurses and gardaí ( @entity55 police ) , " and " hell on earth			2
" but , you know , wildly popular with the locals			0
you 've been officially warned			0
do n't ... expect to drink all night most pubs close at 11:30 p.m. on weeknights and 1a.m			1
do ... make friends the party still goes on after - hours in people 's homes			2
make sure to hit the off - license before 10:30 p.m. to stock up or you 'll be doubly out of luck			0
@entity2 : photo essay -- exploring western @entity70 3			2
do n't ... try to get inside @entity72 's birthplace 21 @entity73 is not a museum			1
it 's the writing centre for the @entity76 and @entity77 's of @entity79 students at @entity80			2
there are no tours ; just would - be writers attending lectures and jumping in shock each time you ring the buzzer and shout : " @entity72 ! " i speak from personal experience			0
do ... visit the @entity90 exhibit at @entity91 brilliant			0
definitely open to the public			0
or if it 's still @entity95 you 're after , visit 1 @entity96 to see the house where he grew up or the @entity72 statue in @entity96			1
do n't ... call an @entity100 ( or @entity101 ) @entity102 this goes for the whole of the @entity55			2
want to start a fistfight ? talk about how @entity106 is the greatest capital city in the @entity102 ; tourist goes down			1
do ... get it right the @entity55 is independent of the the crown			0
it has been a @entity110 since 1922			0
@entity70 is part of the @entity102			0
@entity2 : a night down the pub in @entity106 by the numbers 5			1
do n't ... automatically dismiss the food i might be a bit biased here because i find traditional @entity55 fare incredibly satisfying : hearty shepherd 's pie , fat pink @entity55 salmon , mussels , chips and potato boxty -- what 's not to like ? @entity106 is a vibrant capital city , full of trendy restaurants offering ethnic and traditional specialties			1
new @entity55 cuisine puts heavy emphasis on organically sourced ingredients and it 's the norm to find vegan and coeliac options on most menus			2
do ... try @entity55 classics with a twist for souped - up takes on homestyle @entity55 classics like fish pie and bangers & mash , try @entity141 or @entity142			0
@entity143 on @entity144 has great fresh sushi , or try @entity147 's @entity146 on @entity148 for crepes and gallettes			2
@entity151 in @entity31 has quite possibly the world 's perfect burger with homemade fixings from the @entity156 buns to the homemade spicy ketchup and patties of 100 % locally sourced beef , chicken and lamb			2
do n't ... stick to @entity162 and @entity163 historical sights @entity106 's got serious @entity165 , dating from the 9th century , and plenty of local pre-history to explore			1
take the @entity168 20 @entity169 gets you a seat on the @entity168 -- a bright yellow amphibious vehicle that parades you around @entity106 's city centre to learn about its @entity168 past			1
at the end of the tour , the vehicle slips into the @entity178 for a cruise			0
best of all , the tour leader encourages passengers to shout " @entity184 ! " like @entity182 at hapless pedestrians			0
bonus : everyone gets to wear plastic @entity168 helmets			0
alternatively , visit @entity190 - @entity189 to see bog people -- bodies preserved to eerie near - perfection thousands of years ago in @entity190 's peat bogs			1
@entity2 : 5 of @entity70 's best beaches 7			2
attend the @entity196 celebrating @entity196 in @entity106 is a bucket - list goal for many -- too many			1
try to be content with simply being in - country for the holiday , unless you like vomit - lined streets , exposed genitalia and sidewalk - to - sidewalk crowds			1
head somewhere on the @entity204 the @entity204 has less crowds and less tourist nonsense			0
try visiting @entity207 for their annual @entity208			0
do n't ... order a @entity210 's why would you ? @entity210 's stout comes from @entity213 ! gasp			1
do ... order a @entity214 you 're in the land from whence the mother 's milk flows , after all			0
@entity219 signed a 9000 - year lease on the @entity221 in @entity106 2 , so you 've got plenty of time			1
@entity226 opportunities in @entity70 9			0
do n't ... expect an " authentic " trad music session these days , catching a trad music session in @entity106 is like watching a rodeo in @entity230			1
while you might get some sessions in touristy @entity7 or at @entity35 , you 'll have better luck finding spontaneous traditional @entity55 music out on the @entity204 or in the countryside			0
do ... find @entity106 - style standup comedy on monday nights , the @entity237 at 23 @entity238 in @entity28 hosts @entity240 -- an open mic poetry , music and writing slam -- held in both @entity243 and @entity55			1
do n't ... take a photo next to @entity246 during my first visit to @entity106 , my @entity55 then - boyfriend forbade me to set foot near the statue of @entity246 for fear i 'd get myself -- him -- pegged as a tourist			1
turned out , there was n't even a point in trying to get a photo ; @entity106 's most famous working girl still has people crawling all over her			1
do ... find another idol try taking a photo next to the statue of @entity263 's @entity262 on @entity264 or @entity265 at @entity266 and the @entity267 for an easier photo op. @entity106 has lots of terrific statues that are n't mobbed by tourists			1
