-- nearly 13 years after the 9/11 attacks , many @entity1 were likely surprised to learn that one of their fellow citizens had committed suicide on behalf of @entity6 in a massive bombing attack last week in northern @entity8			1
the @entity1 @entity6 recruit 's name was @entity11 , according to the @entity12 , and he grew up in @entity13 , @entity14 , where he played high school football			1
@entity11 , who was 22 , is the first @entity1 suicide bomber in @entity8 , but he is not the first @entity1 citizen to die in a suicide attack on behalf of an @entity6 - affiliated group			1
in the past six years , at least three @entity1 have conducted suicide attacks in @entity20 for @entity21 , @entity6 's @entity20 affiliate			1
it is cases like that of @entity25 that explain why senior @entity1 counterterrorism officials tell me that they are " all @entity8 , all the time			1
" insurgencies such as the one going on in @entity8 against the @entity33 regime can go on for many years			0
indeed , since @entity35 , the average insurgency has lasted at least a decade , according to an authoritative study by @entity37			0
the @entity8 conflict is now only in its fourth year , so @entity8 could well prove an important training ground for foreign fighters for many years in the future			2
also , @entity6 - affiliated groups now control territory stretching from @entity44 in western @entity8 to @entity45 in @entity46 , 400 miles to the east			2
this is a large safe haven for @entity6 in the heart of the @entity50			0
the fact that the @entity8 conflict will likely go on for a long time , and that it is already providing a large safe haven to @entity6 and like - minded groups , deeply worries @entity1 administration officials			1
and @entity8 , after all , is an issue that has entirely happened on the @entity58 administration 's watch , unlike @entity46 or @entity59			0
according to a senior @entity1 intelligence official , @entity11 - @entity11 is one of around 100 @entity1 who have traveled to @entity8 or have tried to do so as the civil war there grinds on			1
not all of these @entity1 have joined @entity6 -- there are many factions fighting in @entity8 -- but a number have done so			1
four other @entity1 have been publicly identified as having tried to join @entity6 in @entity8 or have fought alongside the group , according to a count by the @entity69 , @entity70 of @entity71 pleaded guilty last year to a charge of attempting to provide weapons training to @entity6			1
@entity70 had traveled to @entity8 in 2012 where he fought alongside the @entity8 @entity6 affiliate , which is known as the @entity75			1
@entity76 , a legal permanent @entity1 resident from @entity77 , was arrested by the @entity78 at @entity79 in @entity80 last year while trying to fly to @entity81 , allegedly in order to join the @entity75			2
@entity76 's father has said the allegations against his son are false			0
similarly , @entity86 , an 18 - year - old @entity1 citizen from @entity87 , @entity88 , was arrested at @entity90 's @entity89 on april 19 , 2013 , and was charged with attempting to join the @entity75			1
@entity86 's father also denied the charges			0
and two months ago , @entity93 , a 20 - year - old from @entity71 , was arrested near the @entity96 border while allegedly traveling to join an @entity6 splinter group in @entity8			1
he has pleaded not guilty to the charge			0
it is not just the @entity1 who have fought in @entity8 or have attempted to do so who worry @entity58 administration officials			1
there are now " foreign fighters " from around the world who are pouring into @entity8			0
at a conference in @entity110 on friday to discuss how @entity6 and its affiliates have transformed in recent years , @entity106 , the senior director for counterterrorism at the @entity108 , noted that the administration is worried about " the unprecedented number of fighters flowing into @entity8			2
" a particular concern is the many hundreds of @entity116 who have fought in @entity8 , who may use training acquired there to carry out attacks in the @entity121			1
many are from " visa waiver " countries that do not need visas to travel to the @entity1			0
underlining the seriousness of this threat : on sunday , @entity129 authorities arrested a suspect in the may 24 shooting at the @entity132 in @entity133 , where three people were killed with an @entity135			2
the chief prosecutor of @entity137 , @entity138 , said that the suspect , @entity139 , traveled to @entity8 last year , one of 700 @entity129 citizens reported to have gone there			1
according to @entity143 officials , 450 @entity143 citizens or residents have traveled to @entity8 to fight over the past three years , and about 80 % of those have returned to the @entity143			2
and the war in @entity8 is attracting -- just as it is in the @entity1 -- fighters from all kinds of ethnic backgrounds , not just those of @entity8 descent			1
a @entity143 official says the vast majority of @entity143 fighters going to @entity8 do not have any real links to the country other than a desire to fight in a holy war against the @entity33 regime			2
the problem in @entity8 is compounded by the fact that , according to both @entity143 counterterrorism officials and @entity1 intelligence officials , senior @entity6 members based in @entity77 have traveled to @entity8 to direct operations			1
according to a senior @entity1 intelligence official , these include veteran members of @entity6 " with strong resumes and full rolodexes			2
" as fbi director @entity172 explained in an interview with the @entity174 a month ago , officials are determined to prevent the kind of " blowback " from @entity8 that occurred previously from foreign fighters who had trained in @entity59 in the years before 9/11			0
" we see @entity8 as that , but an order of magnitude worse in a couple of respects			0
far more people going there			0
far easier to travel to and back from			0
so there 's going to be a diaspora out of @entity8 at some point , and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from @entity8 today to a future 9/11			0
" interestingly , an @entity1 cleric , @entity188 , who was born in @entity189 , @entity190 , in 1972 , is an important spiritual influence on the foreign fighters who have joined @entity6 - affiliated groups in @entity8 , although there is no suggestion that @entity188 is involved himself in recruitment efforts for these militant groups			1
this finding was reported in a paper released in april by the @entity201 - based @entity200 for the @entity202 , which has done authoritative work tracking the foreign fighters traveling to @entity8 and which arrived at its conclusions by tracking the social media accounts of foreign fighters in @entity8			0
many of the foreign fighters in @entity8 are avid posters on @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			0
indeed , the suicide attack by the @entity214 last week was documented by @entity6 's propaganda arm in @entity8 and posted on @entity210			1
if @entity216 was the first war covered by television , and the @entity219 was the first war carried live by cable news , in many ways @entity8 is the first social media war -- where the conflict is largely documented on @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212			0
all of these innovative tools were , of course , invented in the @entity1			0
the irony that @entity6 members in @entity8 use these tools routinely is no doubt lost on most of them			2
@entity6 does n't really do irony			0
thanks to @entity230 for his research assistance .			0
