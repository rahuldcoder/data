-- leading former @entity3 insider @entity1 is calling for a new vote over the selection of the @entity7 hosts given the ongoing controversy surrounding the decision to award @entity10 the event			1
without any football pedigree and despite concerns over staging the world 's most prestigious tournament in a desert climate , the @entity13 nation emerged as the surprise winner of the vote by @entity21 in december 2010 , when beating the @entity22 in a 14 - 8 vote in the decisive round			1
the choice has raised far more questions than answers			0
notably regarding the season in which the @entity7 would be played			2
there has been repeated talk of switching the tournament to winter in a bid to avoid the sweltering heat of @entity10 's summers			2
@entity3 president @entity35 has also admitted that the vote to decide both the 2018 and 2022 @entity36 led to possible collusion among bidding nations			2
another issue has been many allegations of corruption -- with the latest surrounding former @entity3 official , @entity43 , which were revealed earlier this week			1
the @entity10 @entity7 committee as well as prominent @entity3 officials have steadfastly denied the allegations			1
but the questions prompted @entity3 to create an @entity48 ( @entity48 ) in 2011			2
the aim was for the @entity48 to propose methods to restore the reputation of football 's global body			0
yet former member @entity54 -- an anti-corruption authority who resigned in april 2013 over frustration at what she described as @entity3 's resistance to reform -- believes drastic action is needed to correct the decision to award the tournament to @entity10			1
even current executive committee member @entity65 has described it as a " blatant mistake			0
" " the only way to restore confidence in the @entity7 selection process is to rerun the vote , " @entity68 , the president of non-profit international anti-bribery group @entity69 , told @entity0			1
" having said that , i do n't expect it to happen and expect , instead , that the process will be further contorted with a controversial move to winter and a great deal of stalling and shifting on the human rights issues raised by the selection of @entity10			2
" the treatment of migrant construction workers toiling around the clock to deliver new stadiums and , in some cases , whole new cities ahead of the finals has been another unwanted aspect of @entity3 's decision to hand the finals to @entity10			1
the global body has since tasked @entity91 's @entity65 with addressing the convoluted issue of labor rights in @entity10			2
a report is expected at this week 's @entity3 conference in @entity96 , which starts on thursday			0
@entity3 's @entity97 , headed by the former united states attorney for the @entity99 -- @entity100 -- is also busy , currently investigating allegations of corruption regarding the vote for the @entity7 site			1
the @entity22 may have more paperwork to sift through after a @entity107 newspaper published a damning story this week			0
the @entity109 claims a company owned by former executive committee member @entity43 invoiced one owned by @entity10 's former @entity3 vice-president and @entity114 football chief @entity113 for a substantial sum of funds within a month of the 2022 voting decision			1
" i have no comment to make on any article -- but feel free to write whatever you wish , " @entity43 told @entity0 in response to the claims			0
@entity10 's @entity124 has also issued a statement to refute the allegations made in the @entity109 on tuesday			2
" the 2022 @entity128 strictly adhered to @entity3 's bidding regulations in compliance with their code of ethics , " it read			0
" the @entity133 and the individuals involved in the @entity135 are unaware of any allegations surrounding business dealings between private individuals			0
" amidst the constant questioning over the decision to take the @entity7 to the @entity13 for the first time since the competition started in 1930 , @entity54 believes more still needs to be done by @entity3			1
" to restore confidence , the public needs to see a serious and broad investigation of all allegations - with prompt and meaningful consequences for any wrongdoing , " she argues			1
" in spite of some recent governance improvements , there is still a widespread sense that @entity3 provides far too little transparency			0
" shortly after her resignation from the @entity48 , @entity68 wrote a piece for @entity157 stating her belief that the " only entity capable of insisting on transparency at @entity3 is the @entity161 government			1
" this came after @entity3 rejected proposals from the @entity48 to introduce two members to the @entity21 who were independent as well as a compromise proposal that the chairman of @entity3 's @entity167 should be an independent observer at all @entity169 meetings			0
seeking comment , @entity0 contacted the four other nations beaten by @entity10 : the @entity22 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
only the latter replied , saying that it " does not have a comment on a supposition			0
" @entity172 has previously said it will pursue compensation if the 2022 finals are switched from summer to winter months .			0
