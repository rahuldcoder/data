@entity0 , @entity1 -- i 'm a single father of a 12 - year - old boy who every five minutes seem to switch personalities on me			1
one moment he 's a starving student athlete hungry enough to eat a cow , the next he 's a picky vegan			1
i 'm told by people much smarter than me that this is normal for a child going through puberty			0
and so , while i am not an overly religious man , i have found myself meditating on @entity14 13:4 to help me get through			0
love is patient , love is kind			2
i believe there is something each of us can pull from that @entity22 verse			0
we may not agree on spirituality or the existence of @entity25 , but we can agree that love is one of the most beautiful and mysterious forces			2
when i 'm frustrated with my son , or a friend or even myself , i try to think about the characteristics of love described in @entity14 before reacting			1
i felt the need to lean on that verse last week after yet another ballot defeat for marriage equality -- when voters in @entity37 repealed a state law allowing same - sex couples to marry			1
a visceral wave of anger swept over me as once again i was reminded of my second - class citizenship			2
i wanted to smash something			0
i wanted to punch somebody out			0
the last thing on my mind was @entity14			0
but at the very core of the debate over marriage equality is that scripture 's concept of love			1
it 's easy to love someone when there is no turmoil , no conflict			1
and it 's no accident that " patient " is the first word @entity61 uses to describe love -- it 's first because it is most important			1
no matter how strongly we may feel about each other , we will not always agree , and it is in those moments that we must tap into the mystery of love even more to find a way to first be patient , and then be kind			2
that is true in marriage and in parenting			0
and it 's true in this much - accepted notion that we should love our fellow man			1
i 'm not suggesting the gay community should not be upset -- patient and kind does not mean complacent and apathetic			0
we must continue pressuring politicians to end civil injustice , but we 're not served if we allow hate and fear to dictate our words			2
we can not begin to change the nation 's mind if we can not first speak to the nation 's heart			1
with the economy and the swine flu and the recent tragedy at @entity89 , it seems that everywhere there is a reason to hate and to fear			2
but i agree with my buddy @entity92 , who sings in his song " @entity94 " : " there 's tears and there 's fears and there 's losses and crosses to bear ; and sometimes the best we can do is just to whisper a prayer ; then press on because ; there 's so much to live for and so much to love			1
" that might seem pollyanna - ish , but the truth is that even if president @entity107 signed a law today to make all forms of discrimination based upon sexual orientation illegal , it would hardly mark the end of the gay rights movement			1
after all , true social change is n't revolutionary -- it 's evolutionary			2
that means we will have to continue our forbearance with those who oppose us -- from the black pastor who preaches that gay people should not be allowed to marry , to the white , closeted politician so afraid of losing his position that he would vote to oppress his own community			0
through all of that , we will still have to find a way to love			0
many gay rights activists like to draw parallels between the gay community 's struggles and those of blacks during the civil rights movement			0
it 's not uncommon to hear them echo the words of dr. @entity137 : " @entity139 anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere			0
" " in the end , we will remember not the words of our enemies , but the silence of our friends			0
" " @entity147 ... " but as the frustration of the gay community grows , it is important that we -- and our allies -- do not forget another of dr. @entity137 's powerful quotes : " let no man pull you low enough to hate him			1
" in other words , hate the sin but love the sinner			1
it may seem weird to think in those terms because many well - meaning @entity162 also like to use that last phrase to justify oppressing gay people at the polls			0
but here 's what 's curious : the quote is from @entity169 , a @entity170 who said it in reference to his own people 's oppressors , who happened to be @entity162			0
this undoubtedly inspired another one of @entity169 's famous quotes : " i like your @entity180 , i do not like your @entity162			0
" you do n't have to like either in order to have love in your heart			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			1

@entity186 says gays should show patience after same - sex law defeated in @entity37
he says frustrated advocates must *reject* hate , focus on changing nation 's heart .
as they face *opponents* , advocates should hate sin , love sinner , he says
