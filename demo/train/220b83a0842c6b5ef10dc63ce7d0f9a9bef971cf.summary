virtual reality , the emerging 3d technology many expect to be the next quantum leap in the video gaming world , just got a little more real			1
@entity6 , makers of the top - selling @entity5 , has rolled out " @entity7 , " a virtual reality system it says will pair with its top - selling gaming console to immerse players in the virtual worlds in which they 're playing			1
the system , announced tuesday at the annual @entity13 in @entity14 , joins @entity15 , a similar full - immersion vr system that has captured the imaginations of gamers since its $ 2.4 million debut on @entity19 in 2012			1
" at ( @entity24 ) , we view innovation as an opportunity to build on our mission to push the boundaries of play , " said @entity20 , president of @entity21 , at the conference			0
" @entity7 is the latest example of innovation from @entity24 , and we 're looking forward to its continued development and the games that will be created as development kits get into the hands of content creators			2
" virtual reality utilizes a headset that gives the wearer a 360 - degree field of vision , allowing them to interact with their surroundings as if they were really there			1
@entity7 will feature a visor - style headset and interact with the camera on the @entity5 using sensors that track the player 's head movements			1
despite a multitude of other dramatic changes through the decades , the way console gamers have interacted with visuals has remained virtually unchanged			0
the prospect of replacing the static , two - dimensional screen has many in the gaming world anxiously contemplating the possibilities			2
" @entity64 is exciting because it thoroughly immerses players in ways not possible on a regular tv set , " said @entity61 , a longtime gaming journalist and editor - in - chief of @entity63			1
" wherever you turn your head , that 's where you 'll look , even if it 's physically behind you			0
that sort of 360 - degree immersion has never been done in a believable manner in the past , but the technology has caught up			0
we can now experience the same high graphical fidelity that we see on hdtvs within virtual reality now			1
" @entity6 did not announce a specific timetable or price details for @entity7 , saying models that will be made available to developers are prototypes			1
it all raises the question of whether top - tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new , untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console			2
@entity61 thinks @entity6 is in a good position , though			2
in just three - and - a - half months , the @entity5 has sold more than 6 million units worldwide			0
" not every @entity5 owner will buy it , of course , " he said			0
" but because @entity7 is essentially a new platform on its own , there will be plenty of developers who will want to be first or early on it			2
this is a chance for developers to plant their flags in a new market			0
" so , what does the arrival of @entity7 mean for @entity113 ? with xbox - maker @entity115 also rumored to be working on its own headset , will the independent shop get squeezed by gaming 's big names before it even hits the market ? do n't count on it			1
for one , the @entity15 is designed to work , primarily , with @entity124 , even if the console makers each develop their own systems , there 's plenty of space for the system to thrive despite the competition			1
and it 's got plenty of momentum itself			0
@entity113 has drummed up more than $ 90 million in funding and , in august , brought in legendary gaming developer @entity133 , the lead programmer behind classic games like " @entity135 , " " @entity136 " and " @entity137 , " as chief technology officer			0
" @entity113 is still in a great position with its head start in development , both in hardware and software , " @entity61 said			0
" third - party games have been in the works for the @entity15 for quite some time now , so the company is in a good spot for when the headset releases			2
" the system got a profile boost at this month 's @entity152 festival , when it was used for a popular exhibit promoting @entity155 's " @entity154			0
" " competition is always , always good , " @entity61 said			0
" if @entity6 's announcement forces @entity113 to be even more aggressive in creating a top - notch @entity64 unit and getting it to market more quickly , then the consumers will benefit			1

@entity6 announces " @entity7 , " a virtual - reality gaming system
the headset will immerse players in the game 's virtual world
@entity168 joins @entity15 as emerging @entity64 leaders
@entity115 also rumored to be working on virtual reality
