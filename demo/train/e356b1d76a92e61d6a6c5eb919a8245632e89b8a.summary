@entity0 , @entity1 -- six @entity5 soldiers were killed wednesday in @entity1 when a bomb exploded in a booby - trapped house while they were on patrol north of @entity0 , the military announced			1
@entity5 soldiers conduct a house - to - house assessment mission in @entity0 on wednesday			1
four soldiers were also wounded in the attack and evacuated to a coalition forces hospital , @entity10 said			2
the troops were taking part in @entity16 -- a new drive against @entity19 militants in northern @entity1 after a spate of attacks on local anti-insurgent groups			1
the operation is part of a nationwide push against jihadists loyal to @entity27 in the provinces of @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32			0
" it will be a difficult fight , but we will continue to execute simultaneous operations in each one of our four provinces , " said maj. gen. @entity33 , commander of @entity5 troops in northern @entity1			1
but resistance in the " breadbasket " region in eastern @entity29 so far is " less than anticipated , " he said			0
the offensive -- which has been centered near @entity44 -- has left 20 to 30 suspected insurgents dead in the area around that city , @entity33 said			0
about 24,000 @entity5 troops , 50,000 @entity1 soldiers and 80,000 local police are based in the region			1
in addition , about 15,000 @entity1 are taking part in anti-insurgent groups known as @entity55			1
the groups will perform defensive security tasks during the operation , the @entity5 military said			2
the new push comes just short of a year since president @entity61 ordered almost 30,000 additional troops to @entity1 to secure @entity0 and its surrounding provinces			1
@entity27 in @entity1 has been deeply rooted in @entity44 , about 62 miles north of @entity0 , since about 2004			2
wednesday 's deaths occurred in an agricultural area on the north side of the @entity67 from the city			2
the @entity5 military has conducted operations there in the past and has frequently come under fire			2
one recent operation ended with several insurgents killed and a large amount of weapons and explosives seized , a military source told @entity2			0
the bombing wednesday was the first incident involving multiple deaths of @entity5 soldiers in @entity1 since september 10 , when seven @entity83 soldiers died and 11 were injured in a vehicle accident in western @entity0			1
the last attack in which so many @entity5 troops died from hostile action happened may 28 , when six @entity89 soldiers were killed by explosions near their vehicles during operations in @entity29			1
awakening @entity93 @entity1 's concerned - citizens groups began forming in the country 's predominantly @entity97 @entity96 regions in late 2006 , and their cooperation with @entity5 forces against the jihadists has been credited with much of the decline in violence in @entity1 since summer			1
but that cooperation has made them an increasing target for @entity27 in @entity1 , which @entity33 said has launched a campaign of intimidation against the locals			2
monday , five severed heads were left on a road leading to @entity112 " with @entity114 writing in blood on the forehead which said , ' join the @entity117 and you will end up like this , ' " @entity33 said			0
and he played video from an aerial surveillance drone that showed three people in @entity29 assassinating another person -- pulling the victim from a vehicle , shooting him and leaving him in a ditch			0
they were eventually captured , and information was found linking them to @entity27 in @entity1 , he said			0
@entity33 said that even though there has been a reduction in attacks across the country , there has been an increase in " high - profile , spectacular " events in his region , citing a suicide vest attack and a bridge bombing that sparked media attention and made the region look as if it were " reeling			0
" but he said attacks like those will prove to be the jihadists ' " @entity144 , " turning the population against them and driving them toward the concerned citizens ' groups			0
" it 's sort of a reverse counterintuitive logic , " @entity33 said			0
" they are trying to intimidate people that join them by killing them , and it 's causing more people to go against them			0
" and @entity33 said @entity31 -- home of the country 's third - largest city , @entity159 -- is an important geographic region because it borders @entity160			0
sunni militants long have crossed the border from @entity160 into @entity1 to stage attacks , and @entity159 's diverse , cosmopolitan population has made it an easy place for jihadist operatives to hide , he said			1
