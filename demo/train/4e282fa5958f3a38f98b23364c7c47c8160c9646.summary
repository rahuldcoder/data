@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 is a @entity5 peshmerga fighter in his late 50s , but he 's younger than his gun			1
it 's a @entity8 artillery piece manufactured in 1941 , kept in immaculate condition and in daily service as @entity5 forces tighten their grip around @entity2 's second city , @entity14			1
@entity0 is one of a few dozen peshmerga stationed on @entity16 , overlooking @entity14 from the east			2
the city is still firmly under the control of the @entity20 in @entity21 and @entity2 , but the peshmerga are in buoyant mood , having first stemmed and then partially reversed territorial gains made by @entity25 last summer			1
they expect much more fighting ahead , and from the generals to the volunteers , they all lament a lack of modern weapons that would help them take on @entity25			1
@entity0 said he would have happily showed us how his old gun worked , but he had only 20 shells left			0
on saturday , clutching @entity35 and more ancient rifles , @entity0 and his fellow fighters gazed into the sky and watched the arc of vapor trails as coalition planes hit @entity25 targets all around @entity14			1
@entity5 fighters told us it was the heaviest day of bombardment they had witnessed			1
we heard well over a dozen loud detonations to the east , but their exact points of impact were difficult to determine through the haze			0
the peshmerga defensive positions on the mountain are well - fortified , with lines of sandbags and concrete bunkers , and a track carved into the mountain slopes for access			0
the @entity5 flag -- red , white and green horizontal stripes with a 21 - point yellow sun -- flutters above			1
the fighters said that @entity25 occasionally launched @entity65 rockets at their positions , but most fell short			1
the situation of peshmerga on the plains below is more precarious			0
there are @entity25 positions to the east and south			1
@entity3 witnessed an exchange of fire between the two sides at the weekend , with @entity25 shooting from an abandoned cement plant just 500 yards away and the peshmerga firing back with heavy machine guns			1
they have placed large concrete barriers across the highway , once the main road between @entity1 and @entity14 , but they are vulnerable to mortar fire and humvees converted into devastating suicide bombs			0
the commander said he 'd asked for airstrikes time and again , but nothing had happened			0
the @entity5 say they are short of essential equipment such as night - vision goggles			1
most infiltration attempts by @entity25 come at night or in thick fog			1
along one stretch of their defenses , peshmerga have rigged up floodlights to try to detect movement at night , but they do n't provide much coverage			0
gen. @entity100 , a son of the president of @entity5 , @entity101 , told @entity3 his troops needed heavy machine guns , anti-tank missiles and armored vehicles above all else			1
they say 70 % of the 1,000 peshmerga killed in the current conflict have been the victims of improvised bombs			0
@entity25 has rigged villages with dozens of such devices before falling back , some of them ingeniously designed to avoid all but the most forensic inspection			1
@entity5 fighters have begun building their own armored vehicles			1
one -- on the front line southwest of @entity1 -- looked like a collision between a carnival float and something out of " @entity120 , " a monstrous contraption of steel plates laid on the chassis of a truck			0
the @entity5 -- highly regarded warriors themselves -- have been struck by the tenacity and skill of their enemy			1
one senior commander called them " very professional and well - trained , " noting the complex attack launched from four directions on @entity132 at the end of january			0
@entity25 ' ability to rig up quickly and detonate explosives has destroyed bridges across the region -- among them a modern concrete bridge on the main highway between @entity1 and @entity14 now reduced to slabs			1
some of the peshmerga , who are at the front lines on two - week rotations , are grandfathers fighting their third or fourth war			0
near the village of @entity149 , we met @entity150 , a fighter sporting a moustache straight out of colonial @entity152 and the traditional white and red checkered headscarf			0
" i am too old for this , " he said with a laugh -- and then pointed toward a sandbank in a nearby river where @entity25 fighters had several times crossed at night			1
" a couple of nights ago , it was raining , " he said			0
" they crossed the river by boat			0
we fought them until the morning			0
when our reinforcements arrived , we forced them to the other side of the river			0
" the @entity5 have built a modern - day version of @entity171 along a stretch of territory more than 100 miles long , with bunkers on hilltops , fences and deep trenches designed to keep out @entity179 suicide bombs			1
some of these vehicles are captured and briskly converted for use by the peshmerga			2
" we are getting @entity185 weaponry , " joked one fighter			0
" it was given by the @entity185 to the @entity2 army , and when they fled , @entity25 took it			1
now we are taking it from @entity25			1
" @entity132 is an oil - rich city , home to nearly a million @entity5 , @entity192 and @entity193 and long a fault line in @entity2 's ethnic mosaic			1
it 's also a target for @entity25			1
at the end of january while using fog for cover , the group launched an attack on the city from four directions , taking several bridges on the outskirts			2
it took two days of heavy fighting by peshmerga , supported by airstrikes , to repel the offensive			2
@entity211 , the @entity5 commander in the area , expects another assault			1
without the peshmerga presence , he insists , the city would fall to @entity25 within hours			2
for now , the two sides are separated only by a narrow canal			0
the black flag of @entity25 can be seen clearly on the other side			2
the @entity5 have established a line of fortifications ; earthmovers scramble to dig deeper and more defensible positions			2
just behind them are hastily dug graves for some of the dozens of @entity25 fighters killed in the recent battle			2
in the city , there is an uneasy but peaceful sharing of duties between the peshmerga and the @entity2 police and army			2
but there 's no doubt who holds the upper hand			0
while @entity2 police sport new @entity242 cars in green and yellow livery , many seem restricted to traffic duty			2
the peshmerga race through @entity132 and its surroundings in pickups , and other traffic keeps a respectful distance			0
the soldiers wave at peshmerga checkpoints but pass @entity2 positions without acknowledgment			2
@entity5 security officials told @entity3 they are sure @entity25 has cells inside @entity132 , waiting for orders to launch suicide attacks , as they did two weeks ago on an abandoned hotel used by local police			1
while the @entity5 see @entity132 as very much their city , few expect or want to be involved in cleansing @entity14 of @entity25			1
it is principally a @entity263 @entity192 city , and the @entity5 have no desire to spill their own blood for a place they do n't regard as theirs			2
they do n't expect the @entity2 security forces , now being retrained and rebuilt , to be ready for such an offensive before the summer			2
in the meantime , they are intent on strangling @entity25 in @entity14 by cutting off its freedom of movement and resupply from @entity21			2
they have surrounded it on three sides , with an inner and outer ring of positions			0
the @entity2 army , supported by @entity280 militia , is involved in combat in @entity283 province , far to the west , and has pushed @entity25 units out of @entity286 , to the north of @entity288			1
but in this part of @entity2 , the peshmerga -- supported by airstrikes of growing intensity -- are the ones inflicting real damage on @entity25			1
and once the terrorists are defeated , the @entity5 might be in no mood to compromise on their hard - won gains			2
ministers , soldiers and ordinary civilians speak of @entity2 becoming a loose confederation , but taking orders from @entity288 is not on their agenda			1
ten years ago when i first visited @entity1 , the seat of the @entity307 , it was a bustling but provincial town			0
now dozens of cranes dot the skyline as apartment blocks and office complexes are built			0
a new ring road is being constructed			0
oil is the basis for this new - found wealth , but construction and trading companies are also flourishing			0
electricity and water flow uninterrupted			0
flights from @entity321 and the @entity322 arrive daily at the new airport			0
" soon this will be like @entity328 , but in the mountains , " said one @entity1 resident -- without a hint of hyperbole			0
but first the enemy that a few months back was just 20 miles from the gates of this city must be vanquished			0
violence flares after @entity288 's decade - old curfew lifted			0

in northern @entity2 , @entity5 are taking the lead in keeping @entity25 at *bay*
they say they need heavy machine guns , anti-tank missiles and armored vehicles
