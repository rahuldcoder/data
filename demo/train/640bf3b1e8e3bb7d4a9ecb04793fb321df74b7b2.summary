-- a @entity2 man who attempted to amputate his own arm after it was trapped in a furnace credits " human spirit " for his survival			1
" human spirit , its strong , " @entity7 , 31 , of @entity8 , @entity2 , said tuesday during a news conference at a hospital where he is being treated following his ordeal last week			1
" and trust me , whether it 's cutting your arm off or finding some other way , i think all people would be surprised by what they 're capable of , " added @entity7 , whose arm became trapped in the vents of a furnace			1
speaking from @entity8 's @entity23 , @entity7 explained how he was reaching for a fallen vacuum cleaner piece when his arm became stuck in the vents of the furnace			1
after 12 hours of yelling for help , @entity7 had no sense of when he would be rescued			1
he said he became desperate when he started to smell rotting flesh , and knew had to take extreme measures if he was going to survive			0
" it took me about six hours to psych myself up to the point where i thought i was capable of actually doing what i thought needed to be done , " @entity7 said			2
" after about 18 hours of being trapped , with my arm stuck in the boiler , i fashioned a tourniquet out of the shirt i was wearing , tied it as best i could , and started cutting , " said @entity7			1
" as luck would have it , i had the blades that i would use with some of my power tools			0
" @entity7 said about half way through the cut " the pain became absolutely too much to continue			1
" " i would describe i guess what was a near - death experience at that point			0
i had given up , " @entity7 said			2
it was then that he began to think about what he would leave behind if he was never rescued , he said			0
" i started having these images about my dog @entity50 upstairs who was probably also battling dehydration at that point , and my fiance , and my parents , and my friends			0
" with dehydration setting in , @entity7 could feel his tongue swelling and knew he needed water			2
he was able to turn on the boiler release valve and drink some of the dirty water			0
the water , which he scooped up to his mouth with his sandal , gave him new energy and he continued calling for help			0
eventually , friends -- worried after not seeing @entity7 for three days -- alerted police			1
@entity7 was falling unconscious when rescuers found him , and he said tuesday that if his friends had n't alerted police , headlines would have proclaimed his death , rather than his amazing rescue			1
according to @entity8 fire chief @entity76 , rescuers ripped apart the furnace using heavy tools , and completed the amputation			2
the arm could not be reattached due to infection , according to doctors from @entity23			0
dr. @entity83 was inspired by @entity7 's actions saying , " the way that he did it was frightening , admirable , horrifying , brave , and just amazing to us			2
" @entity89 , media relations manager for the hospital , said that @entity7 's attempt saved his life because sepsis , when the bloodstream is overwhelmed by bacteria , was beginning to set into his injured arm			1
" surgeons were able to clean and cover the bone with muscle tissue that was still healthy and viable , thanks to @entity7 's efforts			0
they were able to modify and close up the wound in a two - and - a - half hour operation , " @entity89 said .			0
