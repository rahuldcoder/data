@entity0 , @entity1 -- maneuvering slowly through grassy @entity1 terrain , a caravan of 20 men and women is on a search - and - rescue mission			0
dressed in military fatigues , they are guided by a fearless leader who calculates every step and ensures the safest path for his comrades			0
it takes just minutes for the unit to confront the first of many hidden targets : a muddied 20 - year - old land mine buried a few inches beneath the ground			2
" this is an active land mine made from @entity22			2
[ if ] we step on [ it ] ... it explodes and cuts the leg off , " says @entity23 , leader of the @entity1 self help demining team			1
he and his group are working to make their country safer by clearing land mines -- many of which @entity23 planted himself years ago			1
@entity23 , a @entity1 native who does not recall his birth year , was a child soldier during the communist @entity37 regime , a genocidal crusade responsible for the deaths of an estimated 1.5 million @entity1 during the 1970s			1
he was raised by the army after being separated from his family during the internal conflict			0
around age 10 , @entity23 estimates , he was given a rifle that measured his own height			1
soon after , he was taught to lay land mines			1
for three years , @entity23 worked as a mine layer for the @entity37			1
he then did the same job for the @entity50 army that overthrew his village			0
" i maybe planted 4,000 to 5,000 land mines in a [ single ] month , " said @entity23 , who says he 's about 40 years old now			1
" we planted them all over the place			2
" watch a slideshow of some young land - mine victims @entity23 has helped according to the @entity59 and @entity60 , an estimated 4 million to 6 million land mines were laid in @entity1 during three decades of conflict			1
the mines were planted to defend strategic military locations , target warring opponents and deny the use of roads			1
" i had [ bad ] feelings , because sometimes we were fighting against our friends and relatives , " @entity23 said			1
" i felt sad when i saw a lot of people were killed			0
a lot of people were suffering from land mines			1
[ but ] i did not know what to do , [ because ] we were under orders			0
" approximately 63,000 civilians and soldiers have been in accidents involving land mines and other explosive weapons , according to the @entity83			1

today , @entity1 reportedly has one amputee for every 290 people , one of the highest ratios in the world			0
when the @entity90 came in the early 1990s to help restore peace to @entity1 , @entity23 saw an opportunity to begin undoing the damage he and others had done			1
he started training with the @entity90 and helping them clear mines			2
it was around this time he got the name he goes by today			0
he was born @entity98 , but he was so skilled at clearing mines that his supervisors began comparing him to @entity101 , a heavy - duty appliance company in @entity102			2

... i clear by knife , by stick			0
" for @entity23 , this bare - hands technique " was n't dangerous			1
" but easy did n't mean legal			0

@entity23 and his organization devote all of their donated funds to clearing @entity1 's rural " low - priority " villages			1
these villages , populated primarily by poor farmers , do not always receive first dibs for minefield clearance projects because of their remoteness and limited traffic			2
at times , they 're completely overlooked			0
" villagers report land mines every day , and they ask us to destroy [ them ] , " @entity23 said			1

the @entity1 government says there are 3 million to 5 million mines still undiscovered			2
many of @entity23 's recovered land mines and unexploded weapons are on display at a museum in @entity0			1
for $ 2 , visitors can touch defused mines and bombs as well as @entity200 rifles and war uniforms			2
" i had an idea to open a land mine museum to teach people to understand about war , land mines , " he said			1
" even though the war [ is ] finished , [ these explosives ] still kill people , and the land can not be used			0
" also at the museum is an orphanage that @entity23 and his wife , @entity212 , opened about a decade ago			1
roughly 100 children , some injured by land mines , have been cared for over the years			1
the orphanage provides food and shelter for the children and sends them to public school			0
" i brought them to the museum because i could provide them with [ a ] better situation , " @entity23 said			2
" if i did n't help them , they would have a very difficult life			0
" the orphanage 's first resident , @entity227 , lost a leg to a mine			0
he was living on the street when @entity23 was demining in his province			2

" all the children living in my center i consider as my own children			0
they call me father , " said @entity23 , whose efforts in @entity1 will be highlighted in an upcoming documentary , " a perfect soldier			1
" " i have told them about my personal life			0
they understand all about my history			0
