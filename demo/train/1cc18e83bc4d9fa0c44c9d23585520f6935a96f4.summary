@entity1 prosecutors say @entity3 ' sentence of five years in prison for shooting dead his girlfriend is nowhere near enough punishment			1
they want the double - amputee track star to be convicted of a more serious charge and to face a longer prison term			1
on tuesday , a court in @entity11 began hearing arguments for and against an appeal of the original verdict in which @entity3 was found guilty of culpable homicide , or negligent killing , in the death of @entity18			1
@entity3 did n't attend the hearing , which continues wednesday			2
' shockingly light ' in appeal documents filed previously , the prosecution called @entity3 ' sentence " shockingly light " and inappropriate			1
they had originally sought conviction on a charge of murder			0
prosecutors are arguing that judge @entity28 misinterpreted a complex @entity1 standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case , according to @entity35 legal analyst @entity34			0
as a result , prosecutors argue , he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge			1
in explaining her sentence , @entity28 concluded that @entity3 did not intend to kill @entity18			1
but critics of the verdict have argued that @entity28 did n't correctly apply the intent standard , which is broader in @entity1 law than what it typically means in casual conversation , @entity34 says			0
harsher or lighter sentence ? in their appeal of the sentence , prosecutors will have to prove the five years given by @entity28 is inappropriate in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases , according to @entity34			2
prosecutor @entity55 called for a minimum sentence of 10 years			0
if judge @entity28 sides with the prosecution on tuesday , the case will go to the @entity60 in @entity61 , which will then hear the appeal itself , opening the door to the possibility of a harsher sentence			0
