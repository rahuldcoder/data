-- when @entity2 and @entity3 announced that they were partnering to integrate @entity3 and @entity4 for social network - powered search , it confirmed something i thought monday : @entity9 is the real @entity3 phone			1
i do n't know whether @entity3 has a secret team working on a phone where they control the os. but the company do n't need one			2
it 's already deeply integrated into @entity17 and @entity18			0
now with the @entity2 partnership , it 's tied to the most socially optimized smartphone ever brought to the market			1
" this is , i think , one of the most exciting partnerships we 've done on the platform so far , " @entity3 ceo @entity23 said at the @entity4 announcement wednesday			1
" our view is that over the next five years we expect that almost every industry is going to be disrupted by someone building a great product that 's deep in whatever area that industry is , plus is extremely socially integrated			2
" the first @entity9 handsets are due in stores november			1
the os is @entity2 's complete do - over on mobile , after its predecessor @entity40 tanked in popularity and market share in the wake of more consumer - savvy handsets such as @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 's @entity17 - powered smartphones			1
every aspect of @entity9 is geared to social networks : phone , contacts , gaming , photos , even @entity56			1
focusing the phone around @entity58 does n't just mean that local client apps and cloud apps are grouped next to each other			0
it means that the local client and cloud work together			0
@entity2 tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring @entity3 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 with the @entity69			1
the @entity69 failed and was killed by @entity2 , mostly because it was n't a full - featured smartphone ( it was a fork of @entity9 ) , but required a smartphone 's data plan			1
the @entity69 's cloud - backed social and sharing components lived on in @entity9			1
only now , @entity67 and @entity68 are nowhere to be found			0
even before the @entity4 announcement , @entity3 was a conspicuous part of the @entity80 presentation			1
@entity2 's @entity81 outlined a scenario where users could take a photo on their phone that 's then uploaded to @entity3 automatically , without even opening the @entity3 app. in the press release for @entity80 , @entity2 notes that " the customizable @entity89 screen with @entity90 provides real - time updates so you can keep tabs on the latest weather forecast , your favorite band , a friend 's facebook page and more , all with just one glimpse " [ emphasis added ]			1
that was n't an accident			0
the @entity3 - @entity4 partnership was already happening			1
it 's the exact strategy that @entity23 outlined in his interview with @entity105 , where he explained why @entity3 was n't building its own phone			1
@entity23 only made an offhand reference to @entity80 in that interview : " if @entity9 takes off , then i 'm sure we 'll put resources on that			2
" but he added , with reference to their efforts with the @entity46 and @entity17 , " the question is , what could we do if we also started hacking at a deeper level , and that is a lot of the stuff that we 're thinking about			0
" in order to do that , @entity23 explained , you need to find a company that was willing to incorporate social networking from the operating system up -- not just adding a layer on top of it was already doing , but making that the focus of the device and its services			0
at least one of those companies is @entity2			2
" we started thinking what would social search look like , and we started looking around for partners , " @entity23 said			0
" @entity2 really is the underdog here and they really are incentivized to try new things			2
" he was talking about search , but he may as well have been talking about phones			0
@entity2 may be the underdog in search and phones , but it 's actually been ahead of the curve in terms of incorporating social layers into its products			2
the @entity149 had song and photo sharing between devices over @entity153 before the @entity46 was even announced			0
but that was a closed network , limited to just @entity149 - to - @entity149 , and later @entity149 - to - @entity155			0
in order to get outside of itself , @entity2 partnered with @entity3 early on -- it still owns part of the company -- and @entity3 helped shape @entity2 's social strategy			1
@entity2 has been quietly building a social network without anyone actually noticing			1
@entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 are all social networks where users work , share files and talk about media together			0
you use the same identity across all of those services on every @entity2 device			2
@entity3 is already embedded in all of them : it 's built into @entity176 , and it 's what powers part of the social dimension of @entity165			2
and @entity4 is already embedded in @entity3 , in the form of maps and search results			1
now @entity3 's information is embedded in @entity4			1
and search is one of just three buttons on every @entity80 phone			0
consequently , @entity3 's partnership with @entity4 is n't just about @entity49 > it is n't just about " like " results showing up when you search in a web browser on your pc			1
it 's about incorporating a social layer into media on every device in your household , from your phone to your set - top box			0
it 's about making those devices smarter in how they communicate with each other and from one platform to another			0
that 's what stood out to me most at the @entity9 launch event			2
the @entity56 people demonstrated how to use @entity163 to stream a powerpoint presentation from a @entity212 to a @entity213 the @entity155 people were showing how to chat about a @entity216 movie with your @entity3 friends on @entity165			0
the hardware people were showing off a wide - angle hd webcam that will let families chat with families from their living rooms			0
deep integration of devices , media and services -- using the cloud to power person - to - person interaction through voice , images and text			0
if we think about @entity47 's attempt with @entity236 to bring a social layer to @entity238 ( which has been criticized , in part , because @entity47 did n't partner up with @entity3 ) , @entity242 's idea of a multitasking television set or @entity66 's plays to get on the television screen with @entity246 , it 's clear that that 's where we 're heading			2
the only places where @entity2 and @entity3 are " underdogs " are search and smartphones			1
when it comes to social networking and smart partnering with other companies -- including each other -- the two giants are way ahead of the field			0
