-- " @entity3 " is expected to be one of the biggest movies of the summer ; it opens over the long @entity4 weekend , and the promotional buildup is in high gear			1
there will be much discussion about how the top - ranking box - office star in the movie , @entity11 , portrays not the @entity3 , but @entity12			1
the title role is being played by @entity14 , an actor not as familiar to audiences around the world			2
the most interesting thing about the movie , though -- and potentially the most heartening thing -- will be if it manages to bring back into @entity21 life the greatest single aspect of the old " @entity3 " television show			1
not the " @entity27 , away ! " cry of the @entity3 , although that was always a thrill to see and hear			1
not silver himself , although the white stallion was a majestic and beautiful horse			0
not the " @entity31 , " although few pieces of music have ever been so inextricably linked to a fictional hero			0
it will be fine and fitting if the producers and director of the new " @entity3 " include all of those things in the film			1
but the real service they will be providing to the country is if they have had the good judgment to emphasize the best lesson the @entity3 taught			1
it came at the end of every half - hour television episode			0
@entity3 -- played by the incomparable @entity50 -- would have finished doing laudable deeds and fighting injustice in whatever @entity56 town to which that week 's plot had taken him and @entity12			1
one of the local citizens would turn to thank the @entity3 for what he had done -- to tell him how grateful the town was			1
but the @entity3 would be gone			1
he would already have ridden away astride @entity65			0
in the national memory , the townsman or townswoman would always say : " who was that masked man ? " in reality , the exact words would vary from episode to episode			0
sometimes the person would say : " he never even told us his name			0
" sometimes it would be : " but i never got a chance to thank him -- who was that man ? " however the question was phrased , the answer was unfailingly some version of : " you do n't know who that was ? well , that was ... the @entity3 ! " cue @entity87			1
and the unspoken lesson -- one very much out of fashion today -- was : let your deeds stand for themselves			1
do n't blow your own horn ; do n't seek credit or applause			1
if you do something well , there 's no need to tell people about it , or hang around waiting for cheers			0
do good , and then get out			0
do n't trawl for gratitude			2
legends grow largest in absentia			0
those verities seem to have been steamrollered into oblivion in our culture , in which people appear to believe that each new smidgeon of personal achievement must instantly be shared with the world via every social network or public microphone available			0
@entity3 had no interest in being present when , belatedly , the people he had helped figured out just what a fine job he had done ; it 's hard to imagine him riding away from the town , pulling @entity65 to a halt in some canyon , and sending word to his @entity127 friends that he had saved the day once again			1
but if he were around in the 21st century , where the unofficial theme song is " there 's no @entity133 , " his reticence would make him seem like an outcast , at odds with the tenor of the times			0
" @entity3 " television series ran from 1949 until 1957 , and stayed on the air in reruns for decades			1
if there was anyone bigger and more admired than the @entity3 in the years when the tv show originally was seen , it was @entity145 , who was then serving as president of the @entity21			1
@entity145 was a person who instinctively understood the @entity65 ethos -- he knew that if a man has done his work well enough , he does n't have to proclaim it			2
while in the @entity151 , he wrote a letter to a friend in which he lamented that " some people tend to confuse facility of expression with wisdom ; a love of the limelight with depth of perception			0
" there was no such thing as @entity165 when @entity166 was alive , but if there had been , you kind of sense that he never would have tweeted : " @entity169 led the @entity171 invasion of @entity173 - occupied @entity172			2
boo - ya ! " @entity50 died at age 85 in 1999 ; he had some heartache after the television series went off the air			0
he enjoyed making public appearances as the @entity3 , telling stories to children and their parents			2
but in 1981 , a @entity183 movie producer made a new " @entity3 " film starring someone named @entity186			1
the producer and his take - no - prisoners lawyers went relentlessly after @entity50 , telling him that he could no longer wear the @entity65 mask in public , threatening him with harsh and dire legal sanctions			0
i had gotten to know @entity50 late in his life ; he was quietly crushed by the disdain with which he was being treated			0
he told me that the entertainment - industry lawyer going after him " told me again and again that i was too old to be the @entity3			2
he told me that he was going to get an injunction against me ever appearing as the @entity3 again , and he said that i could expect to see a marshal at my door to deliver the injunction			2
i felt afraid and desperate			0
" i ca n't tell you how hurt i was			2
i 'm a gentleman , though , and i walked out as a gentleman would walk out -- as a gentleman			0
" you can only hope that once the door closed , the lawyer was chastened enough to sit there at the conference table for a moment and ask himself : who was that masked man ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213 .			2

new movie " @entity3 " will come out this summer , styled after the old tv show
@entity213 : @entity3 saved the day and left , not bragging or expecting *accolades*
@entity213 : the *message* : deeds stand for themselves . do n't blow your own horn
*unlike* today , @entity226 says , he would never have tweeted out his fight against justice
