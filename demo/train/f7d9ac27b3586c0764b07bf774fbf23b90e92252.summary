@entity0 -- president @entity2 on tuesday praised @entity4 ' decision to extend the payroll tax cut while also pushing legislators to enact the rest of what the administration characterizes as its economic support plan for the middle class			1
the president declared he is prepared to move ahead with his domestic agenda whenever possible with or without congressional support -- a message with clear political overtones in the current election season			1
" for a typical middle class family , ( the payroll tax cut ) is a big deal , " @entity2 said			1
" now my message to @entity4 is do n't stop here			0
... this may be an election year , but the @entity24 people have no patience for gridlock ( and ) reflexive partisanship			0
" @entity2 outlined a number of proposals believed to have little or no chance of winning approval among @entity32 on @entity33 , most notably the so - called " @entity34 " designed to ensure people earning more than $ 1 million annually pay at least a 30 % tax rate			2
" wherever we have an opportunity , we 're going to take steps on our own , " the president said			0
" we 've got a choice right now			0
we can either settle for a country where a few people are doing very well and everybody else is having to just struggle to get by , or we can build an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody 's doing their fair share and everybody is taking responsibility			0
" the @entity52 believes @entity32 are more willing to make deals in the wake of a bruising fight over raising the debt limit last year , according to a senior administration official			0
political analysts , however , note that even if @entity2 's proposals fail to pass @entity4 , the president can draw a clear distinction between himself and his @entity32 opponents			2
some analysts have speculated @entity2 is also laying the groundwork for a possible reprise of @entity67 's successful 1948 campaign against a so - called " do - nothing " @entity4			2
at the moment , however , democrats are taking a victory lap for the extension of the payroll tax cut			1
the roughly $ 100 billion measure , a key part of @entity2 's economic recovery plan , has reduced how much 160 million @entity24 workers pay into @entity77 on their first $ 110,100 in wages			2
instead of paying 6.2 % had it lapsed , they 'll be paying 4.2 % , a break worth about $ 83 a month for someone making $ 50,000 a year			1
the measure , which passed both the @entity82 and the @entity83 last friday , also extends unemployment benefits and avoids a @entity86 fee cut for doctors for the rest of the year			0
@entity2 has promised to sign the bill into law when it hits his desk this week			0
the payroll tax issue proved problematic for republicans , who were caught between competing goals of providing the tax cut and paying for it			1
@entity32 leaders this month acknowledged they angered voters by initially raising objections to the unpaid tax cut extension .			1

@entity2 celebrates payroll tax cut , urges @entity4 to pass other domestic initiatives
@entity2 says he is prepared to move ahead with or without @entity4
the payroll tax cut extension passed @entity4 last week
the tax break is worth about $ 83 a month for someone making $ 50,000 a year
