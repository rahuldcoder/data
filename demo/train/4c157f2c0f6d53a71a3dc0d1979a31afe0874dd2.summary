-- " i felt a massive cold chill through my body and saw my leg completely missing			2
" that was the moment @entity7 's life changed , and looking back at the gruesome facts it 's hard to believe it was for the better			2
but when the 19 - year - old snowboarder lines up at the start gate in the mountains above @entity15 , less than a decade later , she will be counting her blessings			1
" through this , i 've met the most amazing people and i 'd never have been able to dream of the @entity19 without the accident , " she tells @entity0			0
" i totally think it 's a blessing and , if i got the option to get the leg back , the negative of having one leg as opposed to the positives of this , it would be an easy choice			1
i 'd stick with one leg			2
" it was a typical sunny @entity31 day when the idyllic world of a 10 - year - old girl turned into a nightmare			1
she 'd been playing with her brothers on the family farm , felt thirsty and went to get a drink of water			1
the outdoor pump appeared to be broken , so she went to see her father , who was with a farm - hand trying to fix another piece of machinery			1
she arrived just as " that stupid machine " was switched back on			0
it 's not the pain she remembers instantly , nor the sheer volume of blood that pumped out of her body , or even her family 's remarkably calm reactions			1
" i could n't feel anything , not even the water that my mum gave me to drink			2
i could n't feel my fingers or people carrying me back to the house or touching me , " @entity57 recalls			1
" but after half an hour , it was like my nervous system switched back on			0
i started crying -- as you can imagine , the pain was beyond anything i 'd ever felt			0
" her plight , though , was in danger of getting infinitely worse			0
there was no option of an ambulance or nearby hospital ; a rescue helicopter was unable to make it there			2
eventually , a mercy flight was commandeered and landed nearby			0
the plane was so small it could only fit the two medical staff and @entity57 on board			1
her family had to make a five - hour journey by road to @entity83 , unsure how their only daughter was faring in the skies overhead			1
" i did n't go to sleep until i was knocked out on the plane , " she recalls			2
" but just before that i remember one of them saying , ' she 's never going to make it with these injuries			2
' that 's a harsh thing for a 10 - year - old who 's just lost her leg to hear			1
" that was far from the end of her journey			0
the family moved to @entity101 four years after the accident , partly because of a good job offer for her dad , partly to ensure a safer life for the four children , and partly to ensure better medical care and a prosthetic limb for @entity7			1
@entity57 has not been back home to visit the rest of her family in the intervening five years , and she misses many aspects of life in @entity31			1
but she has embraced @entity101 culture -- first taking up athletics before a chance encounter led to her switching to snow sports			1
showing off on high heels to " prove a point " to her prosthetic specialist , she caught the attention of @entity122 -- @entity101 's @entity124 snowboarding coach			1
@entity122 , who was aware of her athletics background in the 100 meters , javelin and high jump , spotted something in the teenager that he felt lent itself to @entity133 aspirations			0
" he really took a big risk on me but i think it will pay off , " she says			0
on friday @entity57 will compete in para-snowboard cross as the first woman to represent @entity101 at the @entity19			1
" when i started , i was rubbish , " she says			0
" i fell over so many times i think i lost a few brain cells			0
" but now when you 're going fast on good snow , it feels like you 're gliding mid-air			0
you do n't really feel the turns			2
it 's the most freeing aspect , and there 's nothing else i know that gets close to it			2
it 's like you 're flying			2
" while she is thankful to many people for helping her get to @entity15 , one name stands out in her list			1
@entity157 did not know @entity57 nor her wider family , but was so touched by her plight that he came to visit her every day in hospital			1
the first time he arrived with a dusty @entity162 present to give to her , and was only allowed to visit when cagey hospital staff acquiesced at @entity57 's insistence			1
" it turns out he had a daughter who died in a cycling accident a couple of days before @entity162 , " she explains			0
" he and his daughter were both in the same cycling race			0
he finished but she got hit by a truck and died , and he never got to give the @entity162 present to her			0
" each week he would return to visit , usually giving her flowers picked from the hospital garden , and the pair remain in contact to this day			0
it was a long road to recovery for @entity57 -- it took a year before she could walk again after the accident			1
" how could i not have got better with amazing support like that ? there was just someone there for me every day , " she says			0
" a lot of people are interested to know what it 's like to be leg-less			0
i was so young , so i do n't really remember what it was like to walk with two legs , so i do n't miss something i do n't really remember			1
" the fact that she has entertained a snowy sporting career seems remarkable , having grown up in two countries so renowned for their warm climates			0
" i never imagined i 'd be at the @entity19			0

aged 10 , @entity57 's leg was ripped off by machinery while playing at her family 's farm
@entity31 overheard medical staff say she would n't survive as she was flown to hospital
but she recovered , learned to walk and will represent adopted nation @entity101 at @entity208
the 19 - year - old will be @entity101 's first *female* snowboarder at @entity212 in new event at @entity15
