-- it 's nicknamed " @entity2 " -- where blue , chilly skies linger over barren mountains , lush green mountains , snow - covered mountains			1
this is truly a kingdom of mountains -- the southern @entity10 country of @entity11			1
but the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes are a tough place to live and some remote highland areas can only be reached on foot or horseback			0
during winter time , temperatures can drop down to @entity18 ( -20 c ) and bad weather can cut off much of the population for months			0
the rural mountainsides are where boys as young as five tend cattle and sheep			1
they are the herd boys of @entity11 , often spending months or even years away from their families			1
it is estimated that around a third of @entity11 's school - aged boys are shepherds			1
becoming a shepherd is a cultural obligation in the country and often deprives young boys of any form of education			1
instead , they lead isolated lives			0
" i wake up at seven in the morning			0
i boil some water and take a bath			0
i clean my surroundings and prepare for the day ahead			0
then i take the cattle to the grazing field , " says 17 - year - old shepherd @entity46 , who over time has formed a special bond with the cows that are his only companions and which he considers to be his friends			1
" i have ( even ) given them names and when i reprimand them they listen and respond to their names , " he says			0
read this : @entity61 's magnificent mountains - seven amazing climbs the work of the herd boys is both mentally and physically demanding , but their income is often the only means of support for their families			1
for one year 's work , some boys will receive just one cow or 12 sheep			1
prince @entity74 , younger brother of @entity11 's king and the country 's high commissioner to the @entity78 , has co-founded a charity called @entity80 , together with @entity78 's @entity81			1
the aim is to help support some of @entity11 's most vulnerable children , the herd boys included			1
" there is not much social security in this country as far as the welfare or wellbeing of the herd boys ( goes ) , " says prince @entity74			1
prince @entity74 explains that whilst the tradition of the herd boys goes far back in time , the herding used to be done by older men			1
" when the migrant labor began to get into @entity11 when the mines were opening , the older men went into @entity61 and then there was a void			1
then the kids became the herders , " he says			0
@entity11 has one of the world 's highest hiv / aids rates , with around 23 % of adults aged 15 - 49 being @entity105 positive , according to @entity106			1
providing support and information about @entity109 is one of @entity80 's missions , and it is also providing an education for the herd boys through night schools			1
" we are looking at the long - term goals of eradicating the need for herding , but in the meantime we try and bring some kind of respite in terms of education , in terms of appropriate clothing , in terms of appropriate technology , introducing them to mobile phones , so that when they are out there , they can be alerted to weather reports , " says the prince			2
improving the lives of young herd boys it 's not only the possibility of floods , or the biting winds that easily find their way through the worn - out , thin clothes of the young shepherds , that threaten them			1
after rounding their livestock into holding pens and retreating to their own small huts , the herd boys nervously await the impending night			1
this is peak time for cattle thieves and jackals			0
@entity154 , one of the local night school teachers , became a herd boy when he was 12 years old			1
he knows the fears these young men face			2
" many thieves come during nighttime and attack the shepherds			0
they sometimes kill them with a gun , " @entity154 says , recalling the feeling of isolation			0
" i used to be lonely because i was just staying with the animals , also not feeling free , during the day and also during nighttime because i was supposed to care for ( them )			0
" the isolation , the hunger ( @entity154 says he sometimes had to eat food left out for the dogs by the farmer who employed him ) and the hard weather conditions motivated him to fight for the rights of the herd boys			1
" the word shepherd , it sounds like an insult ... because those people have been abandoned by society , by our nation by everybody			0
nobody cares for them , " he says			0
" now what i always try to tell the shepherd , ( being ) a shepherd does n't mean something bad , it means you 're doing something special			0
" read this : @entity197 going the extra mile for education and a hot meal as of october this year , @entity80 has three night schools for the herd boys , and @entity154 runs one of them , in @entity205 , one of the remotest parts of the country			1
he has been teaching there for five years now , and this season he has about 30 students			0
it 's winter time , and the classroom is cold			2
but many shepherds walk for hours after they have finished their work for the day , to get basic education and a hot meal			2
" it 's very , very cold , " @entity154 says			2
" even if it 's worse than now , they will still come			2
and only here at school is where they get what they need			2
" the lesson plans involve math as well as @entity233 and @entity234 --- the language of @entity11			2
the young men are also being informed about @entity105 and @entity109			2
but it 's not only about the education			2
their eyelids may be heavy after a long day of working , but here they can socialize			0
here , they can break through isolation			0
" they do n't grow spiritually , they do n't grow emotionally , " @entity154 says			0
" they do n't grow socially , which is part of their life , because if they are not getting those things , they are not well complete			0
" that 's why we bring them here , teach them how to behave , counsel them			2
this is just like a big family			0
" before returning to their respective cattle posts , the herd boys of @entity11 sing and dance together , forming a community spirit in remote highlands , 1,000 meters above the sea			1
then they walk off alone , again .			0
