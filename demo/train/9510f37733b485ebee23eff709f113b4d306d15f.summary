the recent death of the " snake - handling " pastor of a small pentecostal church in @entity3 has raised an age - old conflict between church and state			1
@entity8 , the pastor of the @entity9 in @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity3 , died after being bitten on his right hand by a rattlesnake during a weekend church service where he was handling rattlesnakes willingly , it seems			1
it has been reported that the late pastor 's son @entity17 has continued the snake - handling tradition even after his father 's death			1
people handle snakes at church for the same reason that people do lots of things : the @entity29 tells them so			2
" and these signs shall follow them that believe ; in my name shall they cast out devils ; they shall speak with new tongues ; they shall take up serpents ; and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them ; they shall lay hands on the sick , and they shall recover			0
" @entity42 16:17 - 18 this biblical passage is the genesis of serpent - handling for churches of the @entity48 movement and the @entity49			1
for the faithful , those two verses are the authority for dancing with or passing around poisonous snakes during church services			2
moreover , if bitten , they are likely to refuse medical treatment and rely upon @entity57 to heal them			0
there 's just one problem with this biblical authority			0
another authority , known as the @entity3			2
in @entity3 , the practice is illegal			2
under the applicable section @entity69 ยง 437.060 , any person who displays , handles or uses a snake in connection with any religious gathering shall be fined $ 50 to 100			2
the @entity3 legislature has sent a message : poisonous snake - handling is marginally illegal -- but not as illegal as drugs or other crimes			1
the legislature 's assigned penalty appears to fall somewhere between a speeding ticket and an overdue library book			0
this illegal practice persists so openly that a reality tv show flouts the law by filming a crime in progress			0
when a network has a series based primarily on filming people breaking the law in your state , it 's fair to say your law has lost some of its bite			2
belief blog : a lethal @entity98 tradition ultimately , the issue is whether a state even has authority to regulate a practice that is primarily faith - based			1
the @entity103 declares " @entity104 shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof			0
" the @entity110 , in turn , prohibits state legislatures from doing the same			0
however , equally as formidable is the state 's constitutionally reserved " police power			0
" the name itself is a misnomer ; the power is much more than your local police officer 's ability to make an arrest			0
the states ' traditional police power is their exclusive authority to regulate the public health , safety and morals of their residents			1
@entity3 's authority to outlaw snake - handling derives from this police power			1
the issue here is whether a state has the power to regulate religious activity ; so the two constitutional authorities meet head - to - head			1
in @entity141 , the @entity140 addressed the conflict between freedom of religion and the police power of a state			1
the court articulated an important but still misunderstood concept about religious freedom : the @entity103 embraces two distinct concepts -- the freedom to believe and the freedom to act			0
the first is absolute , but the second can not be absolute			0
your thoughts alone , without speech or any action , are never criminal , even if of the most prurient , vile nature ( at least for now -- once @entity162 figures out an app to download your thoughts , they may someday be criminalized )			0
your conduct , on the other hand , can be regulated for the protection of society			0
while citizens of the @entity173 have an unlimited right to our religious beliefs , our right to act within those beliefs is tempered by a state 's duty to protect its citizens			2
in @entity179 v. @entity180 , @entity3 's @entity140 considered a direct challenge to its snake - handling statute , using the guidance of the @entity140 in the @entity185 case			1
the court held that the state could properly regulate the time , place and manner of religious exercise -- such as passing snakes around at church -- where the regulation is necessary for the safeguarding of the health , good order and comfort of the community			1
legally , @entity3 's interest in protecting its residents outweighs a @entity3 's interest in celebrating his religion by handling rattlesnakes			1
according to the courts , the state can prohibit this practice			0
but @entity3 still barely criminalizes the practice			2
handling poisonous snakes is potentially more dangerous than other regularly prosecuted activities , such as drug use			0
ask yourself : would you rather your child be at a party where someone is passing around a water bong or a water moccasin ? whatever the reason for not aggressively prosecuting the already - illegal practice , the fact is that it presents a known danger			0
@entity3 is one of the states that has seen fit to criminalize the practice , and it has the power to do so			1
unfortunately , if @entity3 does n't exercise its police power and impose stricter penalties , then the snakes will continue to impose their own punishment , which is often the death penalty .			1

death of a @entity3 pastor who handled rattlesnakes *renews* church *vs.* state issue
@entity235 : @entity140 *delineated* key difference between religious thought , action
thought is always protected by @entity241 , but states can regulate action in interest of safety
@entity235 : @entity3 law provides for only *minimal* punishment for snake - handling
