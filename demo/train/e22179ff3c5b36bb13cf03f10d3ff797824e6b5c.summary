-- my friend @entity1 had a solution to her days spent stressed out as the head of marketing for a global tech company : shoes			2
she knew no problem could truly be solved by buying a new pair			0
but , she told herself , she could afford it , and shoes made her happier -- especially when she was thinking about what she was going to purchase in place of the drama going on at work			2
for @entity1 , whose name i 've changed ( along with all others cited ) , even the act of going online to browse the new arrivals at her favorite online shops was thrilling			0
clicking through heels and wedges and flats , planning and plotting her purchases , was as stimulating as the coffee she sipped			0
when her box of shoes arrived in the mail , it was like @entity34 morning			0
but when the box was opened , the shoes tried on , admired and put away , @entity1 was left to wonder : now what ? " i rarely regretted a purchase , but having a new pair did not make me want more pairs any less , " she told me			2
" they may have filled a need , but they did n't make me any happier , not like imagining myself in them had seemed to do			2
" retail therapy has long been a tool for the stressed - out , brokenhearted or just plain bored ; some figures , including a 2012 survey by online retailer @entity49 put the number of @entity51 who go shopping to feel better at more than half			1
in many ways , retail therapy works : a great dress or a sharp , well - fitting suit can soothe the soul , provide a confidence boost that helps you land a job , or inspire creativity in a way that 's more than just imagined			1
according to a 2011 study published in the @entity67 , retail therapy can positively affect your mood			1
the study noted that 28 % of shoppers had purchased something to celebrate an occasion or personal victory and 62 % to cheer themselves up			0
indeed , studies show , money can buy happiness			2
a december 2012 study published in the journal @entity80 found well - being rises with income at all levels of income -- and that richer families , and countries , are happier than poorer ones			2
but retail therapy might not work quite in the way consumers assume it works			1
that 's because the happiness that buying something provides is derived not from acquiring the item , or from the item itself , but from the targeting it , wanting it and anticipating its arrival into your life			1
that is , the electric jolt shopping can provide is a result of the act of desiring , more than the act of fulfilling			0
meaning : you 're better off if you do n't buy the outfit , or gadget , or piece of art , but simply long for it			1
the evidence : in june , the @entity116 published a study finding that when it comes to shopping , wanting things makes people happier than actually having them , even among those , such as @entity1 , who do not experience buyer 's remorse			1
researchers analyzed the emotional state of consumers before and after making a significant purchase			0
most , especially those who self - identified as materialists , anticipated future purchases with strong , positive emotions : they felt joy , excitement , optimism and peacefulness when they thought of their future purchase , which they also believed would improve their relationships , boost their self - esteem , enable them to experience more pleasure and be more efficient			1
( @entity145 shoes , indeed			0
) but after the purchase was made , and the anticipation faded into reality , what followed was what the researchers called " hedonic decline			0
consumers were left wanting more			0
that does n't mean all purchases end in remorse or longing			0
the @entity160 study argues that buying is less satisfying than wanting , but not that buying makes people sad			1
though the happiness that results from acquiring an item may be short - lived , the happiness that comes from thinking about and planning for a purchase can be sustained			1
below are a few tips for prolonging retail therapy afterglow : opt for experiences over stuff			1
plenty of studies show that buying experiences is more satisfying that buying things			0
the answer , though , is n't to quit your retail therapy cold turkey , but to weave in experiences -- trips , sporting games , theater -- that might provide some added meaning			1
resist the impulse to see something in a magazine , or at a friend 's house , and go straight away to buy it			1
instead , let yourself think about the item for as long as you can			0
( one key to the success of social media site @entity195 , where users can post photos to create a public sort of " wish list " of ideas , goals , and , yes , goods			0
or limit even buying anything simply because it 's discounted			0
flash sales foster quick and easy purchasing , but as such limit the beneficial impact of desire			0
there 's no chance to feel the rush of wanting and to envision how an item might make your life better before it 's put into the cart , paid for and at your door			1
recall , and participate in , the joy of buying things from a brick - and - mortar store , which prolongs the joy of shopping from an impulse buy in the half hour before you rush off to work to an afternoon spent with a friend or even just yourself			1
online shopping is a relatively mindless activity that , while relaxing , offers little in the way of engagement with others			0
shopping in the presence of people , though , fosters a sense of connection to others , which can increase levels of happiness and satisfaction derived from the experience			1
perhaps the most crucial conclusion made in the study of hedonic decline is that more really is n't better , and that wanting a new car is as effectual , moodwise , as having the new car			2
why not , then , hang onto the old one for a little longer ? the next time you 're about to press " @entity251 " or perform the in - person equivalent , remember that it 's not about what 's acquired , but about what 's yet a possibility ; that it 's the hope of what 's to come that provides the biggest thrill of all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			2

@entity264 : retail therapy is a pick - me - up for the stressed , brokenhearted or bored
@entity264 : people enjoy anticipating *ownership* , but it 's a let - down when they get it home
joy of shopping , she says , comes from wanting and anticipating , not from acquiring
@entity264 : delay the purchase , do n't impulse buy , and get experiences rather than stuff
