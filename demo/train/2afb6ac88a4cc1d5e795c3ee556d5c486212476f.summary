-- plenty of @entity3 comedies have been adapted for the @entity5 audience ( " @entity6 , " " @entity7 " and " @entity8 " among others )			1
but @entity3 - @entity11 comedies ? not so much			1
" @entity16 " is the rare @entity13 © cois film that will get the @entity15 treatment			1
the story of a prolific sperm donor who learns he has fathered more than 500 children will open next fall under the title " @entity25 , " with @entity23 in the starring role			1
but months before " @entity25 " comes out , @entity5 moviegoers are getting a chance to see the @entity3 - language original			1
" @entity16 " is about to expand to theaters in @entity30 , @entity31 and other cities after opening in @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
it 's earned positive reviews from many @entity5 critics including the @entity39 's @entity38 , who called the film a crowd - pleaser with " charm to burn			1
" the @entity39 and the @entity43 praised actor @entity45 's performance as @entity46 ( the @entity23 role ) , an affable underachiever who only learns of his prodigious reproductive record after 142 of his offspring file a class action suit seeking to reveal the identity of the donor known only as @entity16			1
" we felt that it was a great premise to explore what fatherhood is all about today , " says director and co-writer @entity55			0
in a conversation with @entity0 in @entity34 , @entity55 and his star described " @entity16 " as the rare comedy that translates across cultures			1
" we 've had a great success in @entity65 and now the film is traveling throughout the world , " @entity55 said			2
" comedies do n't always travel as well as other genres , so it 's a pleasant surprise			0
" @entity45 attributes the film 's widespread appeal to its earnest tone			2
" when you have the tagline , ' this guy is the father of 533 kids , ' you 're expecting a kind of , maybe almost goofy comedy			0
and that 's not the case ( with this film ) , " he told @entity0			2
" the movie ( is ) actually touching and more human than just being funny			0
i think people responded very well to that ... and i think that 's why it talks to people outside of @entity89 and @entity65 -- it 's just universal themes			0
" that universal quality apparently was n't lost on the people at @entity93 , who snapped up the english - language rights			1
@entity55 adapted his original script ( co-written with @entity97 )			0
in another coup , @entity93 also tapped him to direct the remake			2
" we felt that there was that potential to have a movie made here with the @entity5 culture -- with this story but with the @entity5 culture embedded into it , " @entity55 said			1
@entity55 would n't reveal what changes he made for @entity15 other than the title ( the studio perhaps thinking " @entity16 " would suggest a film about coffee )			1
but given how middle - of - the - road many @entity5 comedies can be , it seems unlikely " @entity25 " will begin , as " @entity16 " does , with a masturbation scene			1
the constant between both films is the main character 's journey -- from carefree lug to a guy with greater maturity who tries to play a positive role in the lives of his many , many children			2
@entity55 expresses surprise at how quickly the @entity15 version came together , right down to casting the leading man			1
" we hooked up right away with @entity23 and he was great			1
he loved the story , loved the original , and he had a window of availability for us in september ( 2012 ) , so it all just happened very smoothly , " @entity55 said			0
@entity45 praises his @entity5 counterpart			2
" i 've seen a lot of @entity23 's comedies , like ' made ' and ' swingers			2
' the guy is great			0
i think it 's going to be a great part for him			0
" @entity45 denies feeling proprietary about the role he originated			0
" a part is a part , " he told @entity0			0
" it 's like music			0
i happen to be the luckiest guy because i was the first to play that symphony , but there 'll be a remake also in @entity152 and one in @entity154 in a @entity156 kind of way , and i think i 'm just privileged to be the first to do it			0
but it 's such a great part i 'm very happy that it 's going to be played again but in a different way			0
" " @entity25 " is due for release in october			2
@entity55 said if this new version meets with success , it will be icing on the cake			0
" our greatest expectations have been exceeded a long time ago			0

@entity3 - language " @entity16 " *undergoes* a @entity15 remake
@entity5 version will be called " @entity25 " and star @entity23
the film is about a sperm - donor who has fathered *hundreds* of children
