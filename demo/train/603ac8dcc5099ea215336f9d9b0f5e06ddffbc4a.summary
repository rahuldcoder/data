-- last week , presidential candidate @entity1 said that if he were elected president , he would stop funding the @entity3			1
as the stewards of the @entity12 brand , as parents , as products of families that relied on @entity3 to provide educational support , we ca n't stay silent about this			1
it is an attack not just on @entity3 , but on @entity16 's children			2
@entity17 has spent most of his life as an education advocate , hosting @entity3 's " @entity12 " for 26 years , testifying before @entity20 on the importance of education and of public broadcasting , and as a national speaker , promoting literacy			1
and @entity26 , who was practically raised in @entity28 's tv kitchen ( his parents managed publicity for local @entity3 stations ) , grew up with mr. @entity32 as a family friend			1
mr. @entity32 , who so eloquently defended @entity3 against an earlier threat to its funding , can no longer speak out , but we can			1
opinion : will @entity37 be downsized ? how many of our children learned letters from @entity40 before they ever went to preschool ? how many could count because of the count ? how many of our new scientists were introduced to their future profession by @entity45 ? and how many of you discovered a love of books through " @entity12 " ? @entity3 offers kids television shows that are free -- and especially free of hard - sell commercials and corporate points of view			1
nearly every day @entity17 is approached by parents , teachers and adults who grew up watching @entity3 , telling him how much the programs they watched benefited them and their students			1
studies show that @entity3 has been responsible for improvements in early , elementary , middle and even high school education			0
@entity3 represents 0.00012 % of our nation 's budget			0
and while this resource benefits kids across all economic circumstances , it has even greater impact on the disadvantaged			0
yet it has been made a political issue			0
after @entity1 's attack , the ceo of @entity3 , @entity70 , commented that " with the enormous problems facing our country , the fact that we are the focus is just unbelievable to me			1
we 're @entity16 's biggest classroom			0
we touch children across the country in every home			0
whether you have books in your home or computer or not , almost everyone has a television set			0
" @entity1 said , in last week 's debate : " i 'm going to stop the subsidy to @entity3			1
... i will eliminate all programs by this test , if they do n't pass it : is the program so critical it 's worth borrowing money from @entity95 to pay for it ? and if not , i 'll get rid of it			0
" opinion : defund public broadcasting and set it free this is telling in that while he suggests unspecified litmus tests for funding , he begins by saying @entity3 has already failed			2
we wonder what defines " critical " to mr. @entity1			0
free educational tools perhaps ? @entity3 is a leading video resource for high schools , offering older kids exceptional age - appropriate programming , such as " @entity112 " and @entity114 historical documentaries ; it supplies 20,000 digital tools , such as in - depth teacher lesson plans , for students from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade ; half a million teachers rely on the @entity3 educational resource " @entity122			1
" what most people do n't realize is that if federal funding for @entity3 were cut , much of the loss would be on the local level			2
the vast majority of taxpayer funds for @entity3 ( $ 1.35 per person per year ) goes to local stations , many of which serve rural areas , where losing funding would mean stations going dark			1
we remind mr. @entity1 that when small businesses go out of business , not only are their products no longer available to the public , people lose their jobs			2
where is the gain in saving the $ 1.35 a year ? we see only loss			0
@entity37 stays up to pay a visit to ' snl ' well ? we as a nation must decide where our priorities are			0
is education a priority ? are our children our priority ? are we going to support those priorities or just pay lip service to them ? if these are our critical priorities , then we must support efforts like @entity3 and we must speak out when our children are used as political tools			1
what @entity1 chooses to ignore or can not see is that @entity3 represents the delivery on @entity16 's promise to itself : a promise to provide all children , rich or poor , black or white , with quality educational opportunities			1
this is an ongoing struggle			0
and now @entity3 is under attack by a candidate who wants to lead our country			0
make your own decision about how you feel about @entity1 's statements against @entity3 , and act			2
but you do n't have to take our word for it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity17 and @entity26 .			2

@entity17 , @entity26 : @entity1 has said he would defund @entity3 . time to speak up
they say @entity3 helps build literacy , particularly in disadvantaged kids
they say from @entity40 to " @entity12 " to @entity112 , @entity3 provides educational tools
*writers* : funding cuts would hurt local stations , jobs ; this shows misplaced priorities
