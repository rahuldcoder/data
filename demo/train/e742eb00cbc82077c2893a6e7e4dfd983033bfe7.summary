however , only about one - third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment			2
the exact cause of @entity14 remains unknown , and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments , including fiber supplements , probiotics , antidepressants , behavioral - based therapies , psychotherapy , food modification , acupuncture , and laxatives			1
