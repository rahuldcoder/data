-- the summer - long antagonism between the @entity2 and @entity3 enters a new phase this week as the presidents of both countries participate in the group of 20 nations summit			1
will discord continue ? or will some concord emerge ? although @entity2 president @entity11 and @entity3 president @entity12 have no formal meetings scheduled , they likely will have opportunities to chat in @entity3 , which is hosting the gathering			1
to say the two countries have been at odds this year is putting it mildly			0
@entity19 : fugitive or refugee ? the @entity11 administration made former @entity24 contractor @entity19 perhaps the most wanted man in the world			1
@entity19 faces espionage charges after he admitted leaking top - secret details about @entity2 surveillance programs			0
the @entity2 - @entity3 relationship became strained when @entity19 was revealed to be hiding in a @entity31 airport , where the @entity3 government allowed him to hole up in a transit zone for weeks			2
@entity12 declined to hand @entity19 over to the @entity2 and declared @entity19 a " free man " biding time in the airport			2
after @entity19 inquired about asylum in @entity37 countries , @entity3 stunned @entity11 : it decided to grant temporary asylum to @entity19			1
angered , @entity11 threatened to skip this week 's @entity40 summit in @entity41			2
he obviously changed his mind : @entity11 and @entity12 shook hands and exchanged words briefly during the summit 's opening thursday			2
it was a polite -- perhaps a tad forced -- moment , and it went no further than that			0
gay rights @entity11 has often been referred to as @entity2 's first " gay president " because of his aggressive advocacy of gay rights and same - sex marriage			0
@entity12 , however , signed a propaganda law passed by parliament that bans the public discussion of gay rights and relationships where children might hear it			1
violators can be fined and , if they are foreigners , deported			0
critics say the law is so vague that someone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow t - shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex			0
@entity11 declared " nobody 's more offended than me " by the @entity3 law			1
@entity73 : is chemical warfare for real ? the backdrop to the @entity40 economic summit is @entity11 's international campaign to begin limited bombing of @entity73 for the regime 's alleged use of chemical weapons against its own people in a civil war			1
@entity12 has n't been quick to embrace @entity2 assertions that @entity73 president @entity86 's government is using chemical weapons			1
@entity12 wants high proof that @entity86 -- an ally of @entity3 -- has indeed engaged in such warfare			1
@entity12 called the chemical weapon allegations " absurd " because he said the @entity86 regime holds the upper hand over rebels			2
the skepticism is powerful because @entity3 is a permanent member of the @entity98 @entity97 and , if the @entity2 and its allies seek @entity98 approval to bomb @entity73 , @entity3 can veto such a resolution			2
@entity3 has invoked that power repeatedly the past two years			0
on wednesday , the eve of the @entity40 summit , @entity12 said he " does n't exclude " supporting a @entity98 resolution for military force against @entity73 -- but only if there 's irrefutable proof of chemical weapons use by the @entity73 government			1
what 's one to make of all this ? look to history , one analyst said			0
" i think @entity12 especially sees himself as a @entity120 guy , " said @entity115 , senior editor of the @entity116 , who was a @entity31 correspondent for @entity118			0
" he 's not shed that mentality			0
he sees himself as a foil and counterweight to @entity2 and the world			0

presidents @entity11 and @entity12 have been at odds all year
@entity3 angered @entity11 when it gave temporary asylum to @entity19
@entity12 signed an *anti-gay* propaganda law that offended @entity11
@entity11 asserts @entity73 uses chemical weapons , but @entity12 wants proof
