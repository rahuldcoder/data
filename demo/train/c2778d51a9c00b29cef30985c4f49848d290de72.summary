@entity0 -- " inspiration exists , " runs a famous quote attributed to @entity4 artist @entity3			1
" it just has to find us working			1
" and at the @entity9 , which took place in the grounds of the @entity12 recently , there was plenty of evidence of that hard work			1
the @entity9 is a glorious celebration of nerdiness			1
when exhibitors are n't talking excitedly about @entity19 or @entity20 , or the correct proportion of catalyst to reactant in the conversion of vegetable oil to biofuel , they are showcasing the truly incredible benefits to be reaped from locking yourself away in your room or garden shed for years on end			1
@entity36 , for example , a middle school teacher from @entity33 , @entity34 , has spent his time building a singing robot			2
with pipe cleaners for eyebrows and doll 's eyes , the robot is synched to a computer program that @entity36 wrote himself and allows him to control 17 tiny motors that alter the features of the animatronic face			1
he moves the features of the face in time to the song by moving a mouse and records each motor individually			2
the recordings can be played back simultaneously to get the full effect			2
watch @entity53 on @entity54 , create , @entity55 on tuesday october 9 on @entity56 the e-puppeteer has an application in mind for his creation -- a teaching aid for children with autism			1
" there is already quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that autistic kids respond better to robots than to adults , " @entity36 says			1
" the robot could be a sort of surrogate teacher for them			2
they could learn by singing along with it			2
" not all the musical performances at the fair were as complex as @entity36 's robots , and some of the best innovations on display were the most simple			1

collecting used vegetable oil from local restaurants to make biofuel at his family farm , @entity86 claims to make enough to power 20 tractors			0
" most of the production cost is for the methanol , which is used as the reactant , " explained @entity93			0
" you need potassium hydroxide as a catalyst			0
basically all you 're doing is breaking apart polymers to thin the oil down so that it wo n't clog your engine			0
" sponsored by " @entity54 , " the @entity9 began in @entity105 , @entity106 in 2006 and has since spawned events in @entity108 and @entity109 -- which attracted 100,000 visitors last year			1

one of the best things about the event is the spirit of openness that seems to pervade , with exhibitors incredibly generous about sharing their hard - earned knowledge			0
@entity129 expert @entity128 , for example , hosted a seminar explaining some of the how - tos of creating movie props			0
he showed how paints containing powdered metal can be splashed with acid to create metal oxides that give the effect of natural rusting , and how to make fake tree bark from a mold ingeniously colored using carpet scrapings			0
" i want people to see that they could go home and do a lot of this stuff themselves , " said @entity128 , who has built props for enclosures at the @entity150 and worked on @entity152 movies such as " @entity153			0
" this @entity155 ethos is probably the strongest theme binding all the participants			1
near the end of the day , i meet @entity160 , an event organizer based outside @entity109			0
a few years ago , @entity160 put together a competition that offered entrants the chance to build a machine in just 72 hours from " conception to reality			0
" now sponsored by the energy drink maker @entity167 , the theme of this year 's competition was " games " and included a centrifuge made with a golf cart engine that spun players at up to five times the force of gravity			0
" when you leave people to their own devices and do n't constrain them , the results are mind - blowing , " @entity160 said .			0
