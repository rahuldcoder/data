-- they 're calling it the " @entity4 missile			1
" fired from the keyboard of 67 - year - old @entity4 , the missive blew the lid off his dysfunctional family			1
in an e-mail titled " @entity10 , " published in @entity12 newspaper @entity11 , @entity4 excoriates his three grown children for their professional and personal failures and for the " bitter disappointment each of you has in your own way dished out " to him and his wife			1
crews , a retired @entity12 naval officer , was fed up with his children 's unsuccessful marriages and inability to earn a living that , as he said , measures up to their potential			1
" i for one , and i sense @entity29 feels the same , have had enough of being forced to live through the never - ending bad dream of our children 's underachievement and domestic ineptitudes			1
" 5 ways to raise a grateful child in the e-mail , made public with his permission by his daughter @entity40 , @entity4 describes his concern for his grandchildren			1
" it makes us weak that so many of these events are copulation - driven and then helplessly to see these lovely people being so woefully let down by you , their parents			1
" and then this ultimatum : " i want to hear no more from any of you until , if you feel inclined , you have a success or an achievement or a realistic plan for the support and happiness of your children to tell me about			1
this sounds just plain mean			0
yet , the story , and support for crews , has gone viral			0
it " struck a chord , " wrote @entity11 reporter @entity64			1
sure , what parent does n't fear raising a bum ? but as the mother of two young adult children , i had to wonder whether a withering e-mail attack was the best way to go about getting the kids to shape up			1
i asked dr. @entity75 , associate professor of psychiatry at @entity77 , whether the former submarine captain took the right tack			0
for a parent fed up with his child 's behavior , " it can be useful to do something shocking to get someone to take it to heart , " said @entity75			1
but , she added , one must pave the way long before the children became adults , with a warm , communicative relationship			1
although two of his children have n't spoken to him since receiving the note , " crews has been swamped with encouraging messages , " writes @entity64			1
many are applauding crews for " telling it like it is			0
" but does he ? in the e-mail , he alludes to his own mistakes : " having done our best , probably misguidedly , to provide for our children ... " he describes his envy when hearing his friends brag about their children , and seems deeply wounded by the fact that his children do n't consult him or his wife before making life decisions			1
the secret life of my sixth grader perhaps he played a larger role than he would admit , or even knows , in how his children turned out			2
he did acknowledge to @entity64 that due to his naval career , he was pretty much an absentee father			2
the @entity117 story may sound frighteningly familiar to baby boomer parents			2
in the wake of the @entity121 , many parents have resigned themselves to the fact that their college - graduate children may not be moving out anytime soon and may not even have a job			1
a @entity126 2010 policy brief sponsored by @entity127 showed that 43 % of those under 25 live with their parents , up from 32 % in 1980			2
but is the economy alone to blame for what i fondly call " @entity133 ? " " not everything is parenting and not everything is biology , " said @entity75			0
" there 's a combination here			2
" and sometimes , she added , families just have bad luck			0
@entity75 said although @entity4 obviously loves his children , " he ended up missing the mark " with the e-mail			1
still , the fact that so many are rallying to his defense can be a positive thing , @entity75 said , especially in a world full of " overly indulgent parents , " who are n't teaching children life skills			1
everyone 's tweeting and boasting about their kids ' successes , but missing an important point , failure is important too			2
" if you do n't teach your kids any resilience , you fail them out of everything , " @entity75 said			0
" they need to fall down , say i fell down before but got back up , and i know i can do that			0
" i 'm guilty of this sort of thing			0
growing up , i never once called my mother at work			0
yet i allowed my own kids to call me all the time			0
it just took that much longer to wean them off the " workday quickie advice call			0
" perhaps i should have let them figure out mundane daily jams on their own			0
many parents have blinders on			2
if you do n't want your kids to end up with an entitled attitude , why lambast their teachers for giving them bad grades , which they likely deserve , or for failing them for cheating ? when heroes disappoint our kids @entity188 is vice president for academic affairs at @entity189 and lectures nationally about generational differences			0
@entity188 says some parents blame the school or the professor , rather than the student , for bad grades , even when their child is caught plagiarizing			2
" it 's at its worst when the parent is living through their child , " he said			1
" the parents ' successes , even life accomplishments , are identified entirely with those of their child			2
" " it used to be parents would go to the school and care that ( their ) kid has a moral compass and understands right and wrong , " @entity75 said			2
nowadays , the concept of right and wrong is n't as clear			0
" they 're more concerned that the kid gets an a than be a kind person , a moral person			0
" @entity75 said parents are under pressure for things to look good and feel good			2
" they love their children			2
but they 've got tunnel vision			0
" case in point : when everyone who plays soccer gets a trophy no matter how well , or poorly , they 've played			0
" children come out and experience nothing but success , not necessarily done by them but enabled by their parents , intervening all the time , " @entity75 said			1
such intervention also creates a shortcut to adulthood , and that 's not a good thing			0
nor is having too many choices too soon			0
how young is too young for a manicure ? in my salon , there 's a 4 - year - old girl who 's been getting " mani - peds " for two years			0
she loves the pedicure bath , " the manicurist told me			0
what happens to that little girl when she grows up and ca n't afford manicures ? and think , does your 6 - year - old really need a cellphone ? as for the @entity117 saga , @entity75 said she hopes it makes a lot of people think about being more honest with their children			1
" someday they 'll have to frustrate their child , disappoint their child , point out their child 's mistakes			0
by doing those things earlier rather than later , they 'll help their children to be better people			1
" would you write a letter like @entity4 ' to your children ? do you think such a message would be effective in changing behavior ? leave your opinion in the comments section below			1

father @entity4 wrote a *scathing* e-mail to his children about their failings
when the e-mail became public , many people *praised* @entity4 for his *bravery* and honesty
others said he was too harsh and a parent should never speak to children so *viciously*
@entity0 's @entity293 said that though the letter was harsh , parents could learn from it
