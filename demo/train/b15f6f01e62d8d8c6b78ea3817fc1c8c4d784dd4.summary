the double - decker @entity48 ends the nearly 37 - year reign of the @entity50 jumbojet as the world 's most spacious passenger plane			1
its @entity53 manufacturer , @entity18 , also claims that the @entity48 is the most fuel efficient and quietest passenger jet ever built			1
@entity56 , who was also on the @entity50 's first commercial flight from @entity58 to @entity59 in 1970 , described the latest experience as " spectacular ... fantastic ... incredible			1
" " it was a festive atmosphere , i can tell you			0
people were up out of their seats in the aisle			2
it was quite difficult for the cabin crew to do their job ... not like a normal flight i can assure you , " he said			2
the @entity48 was delivered to @entity73 on oct. 15 , nearly two years behind schedule after billions of dollars in cost overruns for @entity18			1
still , the wait was worth it , says @entity73 , which got the exclusivity of being the plane 's sole operator for 10 months			2
" this is indeed a new milestone in the timeline of aviation , " said @entity81 , chief executive of @entity73 ( @entity73 ) in a speech before the departure			2
the @entity50 jumbo jet generally carries about 400 passengers			1
the @entity48 -- as tall as a seven - story building with each wing big enough to hold 70 cars -- is capable of carrying 853 passengers in an all - economy class configuration			1

" i see there 's some demand for the @entity48 , but it 's an expensive way to address a small market , " said @entity157 analyst @entity156			1
@entity156 said the market was set to be dominated by mid-sized , long haul two - engine aircraft such as the rival @entity162 , which offers greater fuel efficiency than four - engine jets of the same size			0

the @entity48 has received 165 orders to date			2
