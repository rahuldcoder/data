-- score one for @entity3 supporters in court on tuesday			0
a three - judge appeals panel in @entity6 unanimously rejected a novel challenge to how the @entity8 took shape in @entity10			1
the court found lawmakers did not violate the @entity13 when laying out the so - called individual mandate , which requires most @entity15 buy health insurance or pay a penalty			1
an @entity19 small business owner and a conservative legal group said the measure was unlawful , arguing it was intended to raise revenue and improperly originated in the @entity23			1
under the @entity13 's @entity25 , revenue - raising legislation must begin in the @entity26			2
opinion : @entity3 is playing with lives but the court concluded the challenge did not pass muster -- that the politically - charged law approved with only @entity34 support in 2010 was not designed mainly to raise money for the government , but to ensure more @entity15 got health coverage			2
" today 's decision is disappointing , because it relied on a new and unprecedented distinction to exempt the @entity3 tax from the @entity13 's rules for enacting taxes , " said @entity38 , principal attorney at the conservative @entity39			0
" we think that 's wrong , and that 's what we 'll be taking to the @entity49 if necessary , " @entity38 said			0
the challenge was raised by @entity51 , a @entity52 , @entity19 , artist , gallery owner and part time @entity54 member			0
he opposes being forced to purchase health insurance under the government mandate			0
his lawyers argued @entity23 @entity34 leaders pushed a " shell game " -- taking an unrelated bill that had passed in the @entity62 - controlled @entity26 , removing every word , and replacing it with key parts of the @entity8 , including the individual mandate			1
study : @entity3 gave 10 million @entity15 health insurance a divided @entity49 , in a blockbuster decision , ruled in 2012 that the law 's individual mandate was constitutional , labeling it a tax			1
last week , the @entity6 circuit dealt @entity3 supporters an appeals court setback when it limited subsidies and tax breaks available for millions of people who signed up for coverage through a federally - run insurance marketplace			2
a separate appeals panel in @entity84 concluded the exact opposite on the same day -- saying the subsidies were lawful			1
that conflict likely will land that issue before the @entity49 in coming months			0
conversely , the @entity90 challenge now faces a potentially uphill battle for @entity49 consideration following the appeals decision			2
appeals courts differ on @entity3 ; @entity49 case likely faq : what the @entity3 court decisions mean for you watchdog : fake applicants got @entity3 subsidies			0
