-- the @entity2 's friday press event has received almost uniformly negative reviews			1
yet the speech by @entity2 chief @entity5 had this merit : it pulled into daylight for all to see the foundational assumption of modern @entity11 gun culture			1
@entity5 argued that our society is stalked by unknown numbers of monsters , potential mass murders like @entity17			2
then he said this : even if we could somehow identify future @entity21 , " that would n't even begin to address the much larger and more lethal criminal class : killers , robbers , rapists and drug gang members who have spread like cancer in every community in this country			2
" the " criminal class " sentence is key			1
in @entity5 's mind , the world is divided between law - abiding citizens and dangerous criminals			1
citizens and criminals form two separate and discrete categories			1
the criminals pose a threat ; if the citizens do not go armed against the threat , they will be victimized by the threat			1
i know people who carry handguns with them wherever they go , and for just the reason described by @entity5			2
now let 's take a look at the real world of @entity11 gun ownership			2
the following incident occurred in august : " a man was shot in the face 9 p.m. friday in an altercation with a neighbor over barking dogs on @entity60 , " @entity54 said			2
" @entity61 arrested @entity62 , 73 , of @entity63 [ @entity64 ] and charged him with attempted murder in the incident , " according to a media release from the @entity68			2
" according to police , witnesses stated that the altercation began when @entity62 let his three dogs outside and the dogs began to bark			2
according to the media release , @entity62 ' 52 - year - old next door neighbor yelled at the dogs to be quiet and kicked the fence			1
@entity62 then ran up to the victim , yelled , ' do n't tell my dogs to shut up , ' and began shooting at the victim			2
" one bullet hit the man in the face , piercing both cheeks , and four more shots were fired at the victim as he was running away , " according to the report			2
the encounter between @entity62 and his neighbor ended nonlethally only by good luck			0
a shot in the face is a shot to kill			0
the great divide on guns nor was this encounter aberrational			1
there 's solid research to show that most so - called defensive gun uses are not really defensive at all			1
in the late 1990s , teams of researchers at the @entity101 interviewed dozens of people who had wielded a gun for self - defense			1
( in many cases , the guns were not fired , but were simply brandished			1
) the researchers pressed for the fullest description of exactly what happened			0
they then presented the descriptions to five criminal court judges from three states			0
" the judges were told to assume that the respondent had a permit to own and carry the gun and had described the event honestly from his / her own perspective			0
the judges were then asked to give their best guess whether , based on the respondent 's description of the incident , the respondent 's use of the gun was very likely legal , likely legal , as likely as not legal , unlikely legal , or very unlikely legal			0
" even on those two highly favorable ( and not very realistic ) assumptions , the judges rated the majority of the self - defensive gun uses as falling into one of the two illegal categories			1
the researchers concluded : " guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self - defense			1
most self - reported self - defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society			1
" that certainly describes the @entity62 shooting			0
with a little @entity144 searching , you can pull up dozens of similar incidents			0
@entity146 : will media stay focused on gun story ? here 's a story from just this past week , december 22			0
" @entity150 , @entity151 -- a man shot and killed his uncle during an argument at their apartment complex late friday night			0
... ' we heard a big bang , ' said @entity159 , who lives a few apartments down ... @entity159 said the men were fighting over a hat and a cell phone			0
" now that so many @entity11 carry weapons when they go out of the home , shooting incidents can occur anywhere , including very commonly the road			0
another recent incident : in @entity172 , @entity173 , in october a man in a @entity171 cut off another car			0
a roadway confrontation followed , the two cars stopped , and the jeep owner emerged to shoot the other driver in the knee			0
he was arrested this past week			0
in these cases , and thousands like them each and every year , it is not so clear who is the " good guy " exercising responsible self - protection and who is the " bad guy " who can only be deterred by an armed citizen			1
but the guns in their hands protected exactly nobody			1
they turned ordinary altercations into murderous exchanges of fire			1
they brought wounds , death and criminal prosecution where otherwise there would likely only have been angry words or at worst , black eyes			0
@entity5 's offers a vision of @entity11 society as one unending replay of the worst scenes in @entity207 's 1974 vigilante classic , " @entity208			0
" the people most victimized by this nightmare vision end up being the people who believe it -- and who carry the weapons that kill or maim their neighbors , their relatives , their spouses , and random passersby			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			1

@entity221 : @entity2 statement *surfaced* the key rationale for its views on guns
@entity2 chief talked of battle between criminals and **civilians** , who use guns defensively
@entity233 : in fact , guns are used to intimidate and threaten more often than in self - defense
he says armed **civilians** turn ordinary altercations into murderous exchanges of fire
