-- somber and brow beaten , @entity1 piles potato greens on top of his head and walks to the nearest market at 5am			0
he has to sell all of his greens to make money so his family can eat			0
his parents and siblings are unable to provide for themselves , so everyday @entity1 is forced to skip school and earn a living			0
his only solace : football			2
later that same day coach @entity18 kneels down to tie @entity1 's shoelaces			0
@entity1 is 10 - years - old and the breadwinner for his family			0
but so rarely does he wear shoes , he does n't even know how to tie his own laces			0
tough childhoods tough childhoods are not uncommon in @entity24 , @entity25			1
in january , i was there with a documentary team shooting an episode of " the @entity30 " -- a documentary tv show featuring 11 countries and 11 organizations around the world that are using football for social change and development in the build up to this year 's tournament			1
we found a country still recovering from a civil war that ended a decade ago , and resulted in around 250,000 people dying and thousands more being displaced			1
during the conflict , children as young as eight were handed machetes and machine guns and told to massacre their families			2
child soldiers were the weapon of choice in this brutal war and the scars are still very raw			1
but there is a glowing red sunset at the end of this story as an heroic organization of local football coaches is changing the face of @entity24			1
one football game at a time			1
the woman behind this organization -- @entity65 , life and @entity67 -- is @entity68 , 34 , from @entity69 , @entity70			1
after she spent several months volunteering on board a floating hospital ship in @entity24 , and playing for @entity24 's @entity74 , @entity65 was born			1
@entity68 dreamed of promoting social change and development through her favorite sport -- football -- and her dream became a reality in 2007 when @entity65 set up its first program in @entity24			1
@entity65 ' mission is simple : " to develop positive role models in communities in a manner that is fun and challenging			1
" @entity65 currently has three programs in @entity24 in @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 and has worked with 80 coaches and 700 kids			1
it is a faith - based organization and recruits its coaches from local churches , they then attend a workshop on coaching and mentor training and are given equipment to register children ages 10 - 14			1
according to @entity68 , " this age group was chosen because it is within this range that children are in the formative stages of learning and comprehension of personal decision making			2
as well as mentoring the children and training the coaches , @entity65 also has a feeding program			1
@entity114 , after each game , the kids are provided with a free meal to enjoy with their coach			1
sometimes this is the only meal the children get on this day			1
before the end of the year @entity65 plans to roll out a new " @entity123 " campaign to tackle the problem of corruption in @entity24			1
" it 's vital the children of the future know their rights , and know what is right and wrong when it comes to corruption , " @entity68 claims			1
" unfortunately corruption is a very real everyday problem here and we want to try and address that			2
" many of the @entity65 coaches themselves grew up during the civil war			1
they are now teaching children social skills through football , ensuring the children of this generation do not become new victims of the conflict they lived through			1
and through their work the coaches are coming to terms with their own pasts , their own losses and sometimes their own brutal actions			2
horrific memories @entity65 ' national director , @entity152 , was brutally attacked and stabbed in his own home in @entity154 recently as his children slept in the next room			1
he reveals : " it brought back horrific memories of the war			2
the war may be over but the scars still remain			2
" some of his memories are truly terrifying			0
@entity152 says that at just 13 years old he walked for four days with his 80 - year - old grandmother , through the jungle , to a neighboring village for safety			0
he went to fetch food for his family and heard a ruckus			0
as any curious teenager would , @entity152 went towards the noise			0
but he wishes to this day that he had not			0
he watched as a man executed another man , ripped his heart out of his chest and ate it			0
" it is the worst thing i have ever seen and causes me nightmares to this day , " @entity152 admits			0
pastor @entity179 , mentoring manager of @entity65 , has his own harrowing tales to tell			2
he lost his entire family under @entity183 's regime			0
his mother , his father , his brothers and sisters all died , leaving him to fend for himself			0
but instead of picking up a gun , pastor @entity179 found the church and @entity65 and is determined to educate the children so @entity24 never sees another @entity192			1
" the children are the future of this country , " he says			0
" it is my job to make sure they learn basic social skills like respect for their families , their team mates and their coaches			0
these skills are what @entity65 is all about			2
we teach the kids how to have fun , but also how to be better people			0
on and off the pitch			0
