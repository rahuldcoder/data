slow down time by not thinking about future events -- such as picking up dry cleaning , grocery shopping or other errands			0
instead , toss your phone , tune out the world and tune in to the person in front of you			0
small things , but they can make a big difference ; they can simply make you happier			0
no , happiness is not overrated			0
but so what if it were ? if there is anything in life we should overdose on , it is this			0
