@entity0 , @entity1 -- i wore a path between @entity5 and @entity6 for interviews and shoots for our recent " @entity9 " special with dr. @entity11			1
in the field : @entity13 my job as a photojournalist is to shoot and edit stories for @entity2 and make sure my news team eats well on the road			1
on assignment : @entity0 , @entity1 now , i love cheese steaks as much as the next guy			1
but my arteries can only take so much steak , cheese and peppers			0
so here are a few places that are great alternatives in the @entity0			1
@entity28 hours : 8 a.m. -6 p.m. monday through saturday ; 9 a.m. -5 p.m. sunday cuisine : you name it , the market has it how do i describe the @entity28 ? it 's like the @entity36 of food			1
everywhere you turn , there 's something interesting to see , smell and taste			1
it is food sensory overload			1
the hardest part of going to the market is not eating the very first thing you see			0
give yourself 15 minutes to walk through the market before deciding where to spend your hard - earned lunch dollar			1
i saw apple dumplings , muffalettas , spanakopita , pulled pork , snapper soup , strombolis , all the fresh veggies , meat and cheese you could throw in your fridge and of course cheese steaks			0
i finally decided to stop at @entity62 's @entity61 for the famous roast pork sandwich			1
the service was fast and friendly			0
the sandwich was fantastic , and if you sit at the counter long enough , you might hear one of @entity6 's finest talk about the crazy arrest of the day			2
and make sure you save room for a smooth and creamy cupcake ( or two ) from the @entity72			0
@entity73 hours : 10:30 a.m. -3 p.m. cuisine : @entity75 / vegetarian the first thing i ask our local contact on a story is where i 'm eating lunch			0
if you ask @entity84 , @entity86 's senior medical communications officer , she 'll immediately say , " @entity73			2
" this vegetarian culinary delight is actually a small vendor trailer just across from @entity89			0
if you have n't been to @entity6 , you need to know this city takes its street vendor food pretty seriously			2
i still scratch my head at how these folks make so much delicious food in such cramped quarters			2
my personal favorite at @entity73 is a pita sandwich stuffed with grape leaves			2
it 's so good , i usually eat two			1
maybe the best part : the sandwiches are around five bucks			0
definitely the worst part : the long line of neurosurgeons , med students , nurses and cardiologists waiting for their delicious ride on the @entity73 , too			0
the @entity109 hours : noon - midnight cuisine : ice cream the @entity112 is a cool escape back to the early 20th - century ice cream fountain shop			1
although it opened in the summer of 2004 , you would think it was 1944 when you walk in the door			0
the owners left no detail ignored in building this dairy delight			0
the fountain offers sundaes , splits , ice cream waffle sandwiches , fresh pies , house - made cakes , phosphates and @entity130 's oldest soft drink , just to name a few			1
coffee lovers will enjoy the @entity133 sundae			0
everyone will enjoy his or her trip back in time .			2

@entity2 's @entity13 talks about his favorite places to eat in @entity0

@entity112 is a cool escape back to early 20th - century soda fountain
