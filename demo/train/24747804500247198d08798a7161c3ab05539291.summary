@entity0 , @entity1 -- as she grieves , @entity3 is being called upon to lead			1
rather than having dinner with her husband , @entity5 , she spent thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of @entity10 , @entity1			1
the county 's three commissioners voted unanimously to appoint @entity3 as sheriff during an emotional meeting thursday afternoon			1
that night , she was sworn in as sheriff at the county courthouse , meaning that she 'll serve at least through the remainder of her late husband 's term , with an election set for 2014			1
@entity3 did not speak at the ceremony , though she did hug 22 deputies who came to the ceremony , county commissioner @entity21 said			1
" ( @entity26 ) is the best person to fulfill " her husband 's commitment as sheriff , including taking steps to curb drug abuse in the county , county commissioner @entity25 said			1
@entity33 , another county commissioner , explained that part of the rationale for appointing @entity3 -- who has known her husband since she was 14 and , though she is active in local politics , has no law enforcement experience -- is to make sure she is taken care of financially for the next 21 or so months			1
she will have a role , but @entity0 police chief @entity43 will " manage the law enforcement end " of the sheriff 's department , he explained			1
authorities still are trying to make sense how they got into this position , how a man so admired in his community could be so brazenly gunned down while eating his lunch			1
it took two shots to kill @entity5 around noon wednesday , as he sat in a parking lot near the @entity10 courthouse			1
a man had walked up to the sheriff 's driver 's - side door from behind , fired at @entity3 's head , then returned to his own vehicle and drove away , @entity43 told reporters thursday			1
the .40 - caliber shell casings recovered at the scene indicate the shots came from a semi-automatic handgun , he added			0
those were some of the details offered thursday by authorities			2
what they did n't explain , however , was why			0
the suspect -- @entity71 , 37 -- was in critical but stable condition thursday at @entity73 , said @entity43			2
he had been shot in the chest an exchange of gunfire with a sheriff 's deputy , following a chase			1
he " said some things to us " on his way to the hospital , @entity80 first sgt. @entity79 told @entity2 on wednesday			2
" we 're still trying to make sense of it , " @entity79 said of @entity71 's comments			2
" it could be interpreted in different ways			0
" @entity43 did not elaborate thursday , when asked by @entity2 , on whatever @entity71 might have said , saying only that " we do n't want to focus on any particular motive			0
" " we are unsure at this point , " @entity43 said , why the sheriff was killed			2
" we are looking at all possibilities			0
" source : suspect got treated for mental health issues who is @entity71 ? a search of @entity10 court records show no criminal arrests or civil cases involving @entity71			1
his only citation involves failure to wear a seat belt , according to the records			0
on thursday , a source with knowledge of the suspect 's past told @entity2 that @entity71 had spent time at a state hospital for mental health issues within the past couple of years			1
weeping and shaking , his mother , @entity114 , confirmed as much , saying her son was institutionalized for about a week three to four years ago			2
" he went crazy , " @entity114 told @entity2 , explaining her son had n't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in @entity117			0
" he was out in the yard yelling			0
we called the police , and they took him away			0
" since then , she said @entity71 had gotten more psychiatric help at another mental health center			1
at home in @entity125 , where he lives with his parents , he mostly stayed in his bedroom and watched television			0
" he talks a lot to himself , " @entity114 said			0
" ... he was never violent			0
" she added that @entity134 " has guns , but i do n't know one from another			0
" on thursday afternoon , he was recovering in a hospital bed			2
according to the state police spokesman , @entity71 is expected to survive			0
he 's already facing at least two serious charges : first - degree murder for @entity3 's death and attempted murder for firing on a sheriff 's deputy			1
" those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital , " @entity43 said			0
@entity145 's slaying ' a big blow to the community ' the man he allegedly killed , 59 - year - old @entity5 , had been a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor 's office before becoming sheriff in january			1
in 93 days on the job , @entity153 gained a reputation for taking a tough stance on drug dealers			0
his legacy will live on , @entity10 officials say			1
" the flame that sheriff @entity3 sparked can not be extinguished , " @entity10 prosecuting attorney c. @entity160 said in a statement read at thursday 's press conference in @entity0			1
his slaying has shaken the rural county , which normally sees only one or two slayings per year , said lt. @entity167 of the @entity168			0
" it 's devastating , " @entity167 said			0
" it 's a big blow to the community			0
" asked whether officials thought there was any connection between @entity3 's slaying and the recent killing of a @entity178 prison official or the slayings of two @entity181 prosecutors , @entity167 said , " i hope not , " but declined to elaborate			1
for now , the focus is on remembering @entity3 and his family			2
in addition to thursday night 's candlelight vigil , a memorial service for @entity153 will be held late saturday afternoon and his funeral will take place sunday , both services at @entity191			2
@entity3 will be remembered as a devoted public servant and a family man , having left behind his wife as well as several children and grandchildren			2
" it 's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time , " said @entity21 , president of the @entity197			0
" we continue to solicit your prayers			0
" @entity2 's @entity203 and @entity204 reported this story from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity206 wrote this story from @entity208			1
