-- @entity2 president @entity1 had stern words for his @entity5 counterpart @entity4 over @entity5 's actions in @entity7 , following a meeting thursday of @entity10 leaders in @entity11 , @entity12 , at which @entity5 was excluded			1
@entity4 " has a chance to get back into a lane of international law , " @entity1 said			1
but for this to happen , he said , @entity4 must take steps over the coming weeks that include recognizing @entity7 's new president - elect @entity19 , stopping the flow of weapons over the border into @entity7 and ceasing @entity5 support for @entity25 separatists in @entity7			1
" we can not simply allow drift , " @entity1 said , speaking alongside @entity27 prime minister @entity26 following bilateral talks			0
" the mere fact that some of the @entity5 soldiers have moved back from the border and that @entity5 is now destabilizing @entity7 through surrogates , rather than overtly and explicitly , does not mean that we can afford three months , or four months , or six months , of continued violence and conflict in eastern @entity7			2
" if @entity5 does not de-escalate the situation , the @entity10 leaders are united and ready to impose further painful economic sanctions , @entity1 said , with consequences for the @entity5 people			1
" today , in contrast to a growing global economy , a sluggish @entity5 economy is even weaker because of the choices made by @entity5 's leadership , " he said			2
@entity4 was excluded from what was originally planned as a @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity5 , as part of measures to sanction @entity51 over its annexation of @entity7 's @entity53			1
it 's the first time in some 20 years that @entity5 has not been part of the meeting of world economic powers , @entity1 said , adding that the step is warranted because @entity51 's actions have violated international law and gone against the group 's principles			1
energy security @entity4 may not have been at the table , but the summit 's message was clearly directed at @entity5			2
in a joint statement issued late wednesday , the @entity10 leaders pledged their support for the @entity7 people and government " in the face of unacceptable interference in @entity7 's sovereign affairs by the @entity5			1
" they also warned @entity51 that they are ready to intensify targeted economic sanctions and impose new costs on @entity5 " should events so require			2
" " @entity5 's illegal annexation of @entity53 , and actions to de-stabilize eastern @entity7 are unacceptable and must stop , " the statement said			1
" we urge the @entity5 to recognize the results of the election , complete the withdrawal of its military forces on the border with @entity7 , stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among armed separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence			2
" the @entity10 leaders also talked about energy security , amid concern over @entity99 's reliance on @entity5 natural gas and @entity51 's capacity to hold nations hostage to political maneuvering			1
@entity1 will next head to @entity106 , where he will dine with @entity108 president @entity107			2
@entity4 also will be hosted by the @entity108 president on thursday -- but at a separate dinner			2
@entity1 and @entity4 are among a number of leaders invited to take part in ceremonies in @entity108 to mark the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings , which helped change the course of @entity118 they are likely to cross paths while both are in @entity108 , @entity1 said , but no formal talks have been announced			1
if they should speak , @entity1 added , he will give @entity4 the same message on @entity7 that he has given him in phone calls over past weeks and in his public statements			2
there may be one touchy subject at @entity1 's dinner with @entity107			0
in his remarks after the @entity10 meeting , @entity1 said he had " expressed concerns about continuing significant defense deals with @entity5 at a time when they 've violated basic international law , " a reference to a $ 1.6 billion @entity108 deal to sell warships to @entity51			1
" president @entity107 understands my position , " @entity1 said , adding that he in turn recognizes that this is a big deal for @entity108 and that it 's important for jobs			2
nonetheless , @entity1 said , " i think it would 've been preferable to press the pause button			0
president @entity107 so far has not done so			0
" @entity4 : i wo n't avoid anyone although @entity4 was not invited to the @entity10 meeting -- which brings together the @entity2 , @entity150 , the @entity27 , @entity151 , @entity108 , @entity152 and @entity153 -- he will have talks on @entity7 with some @entity10 leaders while they are all in @entity108			1
besides @entity107 , they include @entity151 chancellor @entity157 and @entity26			0
the d - day events , which include a spectacular fireworks show thursday evening along the @entity161 coastline and continue into the weekend , may also bring @entity4 and @entity7 's president - elect @entity19 face to face			1
asked in an interview with @entity108 television station @entity164 if he would speak with @entity7 's new leader , @entity4 said he will not " evade " @entity19 or anyone else			1
" there will be other guests , and i 'm not going to avoid any of them			0
i will talk with all of them , " he said , according to the @entity170 's translation			0
@entity19 also did not exclude the possibility , speaking at a news conference wednesday in @entity174			0
" as things stand now , a meeting between me and @entity4 is not envisaged , but i do not rule out that it could take place in one format or another			0
so let 's talk about it when there are grounds for it , " he said			0
@entity107 said that both were invited , although @entity19 is due to arrive only on saturday			0
@entity4 : no @entity5 intervention in @entity7 questioned in the same @entity164 interview about @entity5 's intentions in @entity7 , @entity4 denied it had sought to annex or destabilize its neighbor			1
" we never did that , " he said			0
" the @entity7 government must now sit down and talk with their own people instead of using weapons , tanks , planes and helicopters			0
they must start the negotiating process			0
" @entity200 and the @entity201 have said the separatists in @entity7 are coordinated and supplied by @entity5			0
asked if it was true that @entity5 had intervened directly , @entity4 was again vehement in his denial			0
" there are no armed forces , no @entity5 ' instructors ' in southeastern @entity7			0
and there never were any , " he said			0
@entity4 reiterated his position that @entity5 respects the @entity7 people 's vote and that @entity51 will work with the authorities in @entity200			1
he also said @entity5 recognizes @entity7 's sovereignty , while acknowledging that any move by @entity200 to join @entity216 " worries us			1
" this concern was a factor in @entity5 's annexation of @entity53 , @entity4 told the @entity108 broadcaster , following the ouster of president @entity222 in what @entity51 regards as an illegal coup			1
whether @entity4 and @entity19 meet personally , @entity5 will give the new @entity7 president some official recognition when its ambassador to @entity7 attends @entity19 's inauguration saturday			1
@entity5 @entity230 spokesman @entity229 said thursday , according to state - run @entity231 , that ambassador @entity232 will also resume his duties in @entity200			2
" he is returning to @entity200 in order to continue executing his functions , " @entity229 said			0
