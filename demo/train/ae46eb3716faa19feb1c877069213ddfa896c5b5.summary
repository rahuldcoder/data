what happens now ? @entity2 officials have said they do n't think missing @entity3 is in the patch of the southern @entity5 where underwater pings were picked up last month			1
@entity2 prime minister @entity7 said in early april that authorities were " very confident " the signals were coming from the plane 's flight recorders , raising hopes of closure among some of the families of the 239 people on board the passenger jet			1
but after spending weeks scouring the bottom of the ocean roughly 1,600 kilometers ( 1,000 miles ) off @entity20 with a high - tech unmanned submarine , the searchers have drawn another blank , deepening the mystery surrounding the @entity26 's fate			2
officials say they are still trying to figure out the source of the signals that led the search for the past seven weeks			2
more than 11 weeks after flight 370 dropped off radar screens over @entity36 on a scheduled flight to @entity38 , officials in charge of the hunt are drawing a line through the ping - centered search and moving on to the next phase			2
where does the search go next ? the underwater search area guided by the pings covered more than 850 square kilometers ( 330 square miles )			1
with that zone now ruled out , @entity2 authorities , who have been coordinating the search in the southern @entity5 , say attention will shift to a new area as large as 60,000 square kilometers			1
that 's roughly the size of @entity54			1
" the search will be a major undertaking , " the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) said this week			2
" the complexities and challenges involved are immense , but not impossible			0
" the underwater search will remain in the same overall region , as officials are basing their focus on an analysis of satellite , radar and other data that concludes the plane ended up somewhere along an arc stretching into the southern @entity5			1
" what has not changed at this stage is the belief that , after weeks of research and re-analysis , that the @entity74 data is correct and that they are looking broadly in the right area , " said @entity70 , the editor in chief of @entity72 , referring to the satellite data provided by the @entity75 company @entity74			0
" now clearly , we were hoping that the pings would narrow that broad area down to a narrow one , but that has not been the case , and now we have to unfortunately go the long road , " @entity70 told @entity84			0
will they start searching the new area immediately ? no. in fact , it has n't yet been fully mapped out			1
the @entity55 said this week that it 's reviewing existing information from experts in order to refine the new zone			0
meanwhile , a specialized @entity101 ship , the @entity102 , has begun mapping the ocean floor in some areas already picked out by the @entity55			1
a contracted commercial survey vessel will join those efforts next month			0
it 's unclear how deep the water is in these areas because " it 's never been mapped , " @entity2 deputy prime minister @entity107 said earlier this month			1
officials say depths are likely to exceed 6,000 meters ( 20,000 feet )			0
the survey will take about three months and " give us crucial knowledge of the seafloor terrain needed to begin the underwater search , " the @entity55 said			2
who will do the actual searching ? that 's still being figured out			0
the @entity120 - 21 , the robotic submersible supplied by the @entity122 that has been searching the area where the pings were detected , has reached the end of its mission			2
search officials are regrouping and preparing to identify and deploy other high - tech equipment			1
but that 's going to take some time -- up to two months , if not longer , according to @entity2 authorities			1
officials say they want the next phase of the underwater search , which could take up to a year , to be led by a single private contractor who will bring together and manage several underwater assets in the search zone			1
search coordinators say they are looking for sonar equipment that can be towed by a ship , an autonomous underwater vehicle with a mounted sonar device and optical imaging equipment			0
some towed sonar devices , such as the @entity122 's @entity147 , can transmit data to the surface in real - time			0
they also have the capability of scanning a larger area than the @entity120 , which was limited to about 40 square kilometers during each mission			0
only a handful of companies have such devices			0
@entity2 authorities say they plan to post their request for tenders for the next phase of the search in the coming days			1
who 's going to pay for it ? that 's another issue that is n't clear yet			0
@entity20 has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $ 60 million , with the breakdown of exactly who 's going to pay for what yet to be announced			0
while 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane , @entity168 , @entity101 and @entity20 have held high - level talks about the future of the search			2
@entity168 is where the plane is from , most of the people on the flight were @entity101 , and @entity20 had six passengers on board and is closest to the remote part of the @entity5 where searchers have focused their hunt			1
the @entity185 has contributed a range of assets to the search so far , including the @entity189 , which costs an estimated $ 40,000 a day to operate			0
are the searchers still looking in the right place ? @entity2 officials say they remain confident in the conclusion -- reached by a team of experts from @entity26 and aviation authorities around the world , including the @entity185 and @entity198 -- that flight 370 ended its journey in the southern @entity5			1
despite questions from independent experts , @entity74 says it stands by its analysis of a series of communications between the plane and the company 's satellite system that provided a key part of the conclusion about the jetliner 's path			0
earlier this week , @entity168 authorities released the satellite data from @entity74 , meeting a long - standing request of some passengers ' families who were unsatisfied by authorities ' explanation of the plane 's fate			2
independent experts are now studying the data to see whether they agree with the official view .			0

the new search area is roughly the size of @entity54
the ocean floor still needs to be mapped before searching can begin
@entity2 authorities plan to find a private contractor to conduct the search
officials say they remain confident the plane is in the southern @entity5
