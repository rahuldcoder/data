official results are not expected until later sunday			2
still , supporters of @entity3 celebrated in downtown @entity25 , cheering the early results , waving flags and hoisting banners			1
one read : " @entity3 , @entity29			1
" @entity2 went to the polls sunday to pick their next president in a runoff election between two candidates with little in common			1
@entity3 , 48 , narrowly lost a 2006 election bid , in part because many saw him as a close ally of @entity39 president @entity38 , intent on turning the country to the left			1
that 's a point his rival , 36 - year - old @entity5 , a right - wing lawmaker , hammered on throughout her campaign			2
at a closing rally last week in @entity48 , a historic avenue in the capital of @entity25 , @entity5 went on the offensive as she addressed a crowd of thousands			1
" there are recordings and witnesses that prove that this gentleman is a good soldier of @entity38 , " she said to cheering crowds			2
" i am not going to allow other countries to interfere in the sovereignty of our country			2
i 'm going to defend it ! " @entity3 , a former army officer linked to a 2000 military uprising , has tried to distance himself from such perceptions , swapping his trademark red t - shirts for suits this time around			1
in a recent interview with @entity0 en @entity69 , he denied his goal is a @entity38 - style social revolution in @entity2			0
" when we speak about revolution , we 're speaking about a revolution in education , which is something fundamental , " @entity3 said			1
" we have to build our own future			0
we believe that the @entity39 model does n't apply in @entity2			0
" like her opponent , @entity5 was forced to answer uncomfortable questions about her past during this year 's election			0
she is the daughter of former @entity2 president @entity83 , who is currently in prison on a 25 - year sentence for human rights crimes			0
many @entity2 credit the elder @entity5 with defeating insurgencies that ravaged the @entity89 nation for years and for enacting economic reforms that stabilized the @entity2 economy			0
however , he is also criticized for corruption , having an authoritarian streak and the widespread rights abuses that were committed under his watch			0
during the campaign , protesters accused his daughter of planning to grant the former president amnesty if she wins , as she said she might do in a 2008 interview			0
she has since backed away from those remarks			0
centrist candidates , including former president @entity105 , former @entity25 mayor @entity106 and former finance minister @entity107 , cannibalized each others ' votes during the first round of voting in april			1
in that round , @entity3 garnered more than 30 % of the vote , while @entity5 ended slightly above 23 %			1
under @entity2 law , only the top two contenders advance to a second round			2
peruvians are required by law to vote and some 20 million people were thought to have cast their ballots in sunday 's election			2
after the elimination of the more centrist candidates in april , @entity2 's 2010 @entity122 literary laureate @entity121 , a former presidential candidate himself , described the race as a choice between " terminal cancer and @entity129			1
" @entity130 , a member of the @entity132 team of @entity134 analysts , said the election was a triumph of extremes			0
" this election was meant to be the election of a centrist policy continuity candidate , and what we have is a first round that has yielded a result between two extremes in the left and the right , " she said before the second - round vote			2
current @entity2 president @entity149 is not permitted to run for a consecutive term			0
" i will get behind whoever wins , " he said on sunday , before voting closed			2
" the task ( of running the country ) is not easy and they ( will ) need everyone 's support			0
" the new president will face many of the same challenges @entity149 did : persistent poverty , protests around the rights to natural resources and violence from remnants of a leftist insurgency that helped to make @entity2 the world 's largest producer of coca , the raw ingredient of cocaine			0
on the eve of the election , five soldiers were killed in an attack in the country 's southern province of @entity179 , state news said			0
they were reportedly on their way to provide local police with additional security for the election when they were ambushed			0
@entity0 's @entity186 contributed to this report .			0
