-- four years ago , @entity2 ayatollah @entity1 kissed @entity3 on the cheek before he was sworn in as @entity6 's new leader			1
@entity3 could be in for a rocky second term as @entity6 president , analysts say			1
song and prayer heralded a new start for @entity6 with the hard - line @entity14 mayor , virtually unknown to the outside world in 2005			2
he promised to stamp out corruption and fight for justice			0
with time , the world came to know the @entity6 leader with his signature beige jacket and combative -- often anti-israeli -- rhetoric			2
monday , @entity6 's supreme leader endorsed @entity3 for a second term in office , but there was no hug or kiss this time around			1
video from the event shows @entity3 leaning toward @entity1 before the supreme leader raises his left hand to block him , leaving @entity3 to gingerly kiss the cleric 's robe			1
the awkward scene seemed to only bolster the tensions that have emerged in the once strong relationship			0
under @entity6 's constitution , the incoming president must receive the supreme leader 's approval before being sworn into office			1
@entity1 's endorsement is the first step in that process			0
on wednesday , @entity3 will take the oath of office before @entity47			2
but he will begin his second term in a deeply fractured @entity6 , one in which the conservative leader finds himself under assault from the legions of pro-democracy supporters and the nation 's powerful clerical establishment			1
given the unprecedented fissures in @entity6 society , some longtime scholars and observers now doubt whether @entity3 will finish his second term in office			1
some question whether the clerical establishment will sacrifice him in order to save the @entity65 republic			0
@entity3 's main political problem is " legitimacy , " said @entity68 , senior @entity69 analyst at @entity70 's , a provider of defense and security information			1
" can you operate for four years with huge questions over whether you are the rightful president ? " @entity68 said			0
" i think that would undermine everything he does			0
" @entity3 was declared the winner of @entity6 's june 12 election , but thousands took to the streets in the aftermath to protest what they believed was a rigged vote			1
they chanted the name of @entity3 's chief rival , reformist @entity86 , the crowds a sea of green , the color of the opposition candidate 's campaign			1
since then , widespread demonstrations have plagued @entity6 's leaders , who have ordered security forces to crack down swiftly and violently			2
@entity6 have been arrested and jailed , their treatment condemned by global human rights organizations such as @entity98			2
@entity1 stood by his president , but strains in the relationship have surfaced in recent days after @entity3 refused at first to heed the supreme leader 's orders to change a controversial vice-presidential pick			1
@entity6 's clerics have made it known they would like @entity3 " to remain a powerful and popular president " and reminded @entity6 that the supreme leader 's word is the last one in the @entity110			1
on the eve of his inauguration , @entity3 sought to downplay any rift			0
in a public address , he compared his relationship with @entity1 to that of a father and son			0
but @entity119 , lecturer in sociology at @entity121 , @entity122 , said @entity3 has alienated the clerics just as he has the reformists			2
@entity119 said @entity3 risks losing conservative supporters who may feel that @entity6 's system has been placed in danger and that the situation has " created an atmosphere for external forces to attack @entity6			1
" if convinced the system is truly threatened , @entity1 could use his power to dismiss @entity3 , @entity119 said			0
it would n't be the first time a supreme leader has made such a move			0
the @entity137 , a conservative group and ally of @entity3 , in a statement warned that he could suffer the same fate as prime minister @entity141			0
he lost the support of the clerics , consequently the people , and eventually was deposed in a 1953 @entity146 - backed coup			0
@entity6 's first president after the 1979 @entity65 revolution , @entity147 , was forced to flee the country after he stood against the clerics , including then - @entity2 ayatollah @entity150			1
the @entity137 statement asked @entity3 for " absolute obedience of the supreme leader			0
" adding to @entity3 's political worries is a faltering economy			1
the world may have viewed @entity6 's june 12 vote through the prism of individual freedoms and nuclear weapons , but most @entity6 paid close attention to a staggering inflation rate , double - digit unemployment and the expenditure of oil revenue			2
with oil prices plummeting to below $ 40 a barrel , the @entity6 government may be facing unsustainable budget deficits			0
some analysts said the president 's first - term economic mismanagement had already earned him the ire of the establishment , long before any controversy erupted over his political legitimacy			2
one scholar , who is currently in @entity6 and did not want be identified for safety reasons , said it is increasingly clear the regime has not chalked out a perfect path to the future -- and how long @entity3 will be along for the ride			1
@entity68 said @entity3 lacks the political mindset for consensus and collaboration			0
but what empowers him may be his belief in himself			0
and one other weapon : he thinks @entity190 is on his side .			0

@entity3 *slated* to be sworn in for second term as @entity6 president
supporters of opposition candidates have protested election result
@entity3 must have support of clerics to stay in office , analyst says
faltering economy has added to @entity3 's troubles
