-- more than two million @entity1 have already cast ballots for president less than three weeks before @entity4 with a substantial number coming in the battleground state of @entity7			1
the state , which holds six key electoral votes , is on pace to exceed the 1.5 million votes cast early in 2008 -- a trend that is not lost on either political party			1
while both parties are investing resources in early voting , @entity15 ' push to turn out voters -- and in particular young voters in @entity7 -- could be paying off			1
early numbers , which are updated daily , show that almost 20 % more registered @entity15 than registered @entity22 have voted so far			1
of the 463,219 early voting ballots requested in the state as of thursday morning , 45 % came from registered @entity15 compared to 30 % of registered @entity22			1
in voting , the early bird skips the line experts caution no direct link should be made between requests and how the vote might go			2
" we do n't know if a registered @entity37 will vote for @entity38 and we do n't know if a registered @entity22 will vote for @entity39 , " said @entity32 , associate professor government and politics at @entity34 who specializes in elections			1
but return data coupled with polls that show a slight lead for @entity38 in @entity7 , he said , can give us some clue			1
the electoral makeup in @entity7 looks like it did in 2008 when @entity38 took the state by almost 10 points , according to @entity32			2
so far this year , 4 % more democrats have voted early than in 2008			2
@entity22 numbers have only risen by 1 %			1
that 's not enough for @entity39 if he wants to flip the state , @entity32 said			0
" it 's not just enough to recreate the 2008 electorate			0
@entity39 needs to have improvement , " @entity32 said			0
that 's assuming that @entity4 returns mirror 2008 as well			2
@entity39 's improvement might come naturally to republicans in @entity59 , @entity7 , one of the @entity7 's most populous counties			1
@entity62 , the deputy commissioner of elections there , said @entity15 are more naturally inclined to vote early and @entity22 are more apt to cast ballots on @entity4			1
" if you paint it with a broad brush , a lot of @entity15 vote absentee , @entity22 go to the polls			1
they always start behind [ in @entity59 ] , " @entity71 said			0
he also attributed the @entity15 success to an organized effort to turnout early voters			1
democrats , for instance , requested more satellite voting sites for early voting and staffed them more heavily than @entity22			1
there is some good news for @entity39 in the state since early voting requests and returns are slowly closing the gap between @entity22 and @entity15 , day - to - day monitoring shows			1
with some " hustling " and a push at the end , @entity39 could make a race of it , @entity32 said			0
he could also change the game if he is able to turn out more republicans on @entity4 than the @entity22 did in 2008			1
@entity94 : who benefits from early voting ? and while @entity7 's electoral votes could be key to winning the @entity97 , what is true of @entity7 is not true of @entity99 or of @entity100 , two of the 22 states that have begun early voting			1
" each state is like a unique snowflake [ when it comes to early voting ] , " said @entity32 since the @entity103 gives each state the right to administer their elections at a state level			2
what this also means is that with different demographics , @entity15 and @entity22 have different strategies for turning out early voters in each state with different results			1
what 's also different is the way that states collect data , meaning that it is easier to infer conclusions from returns in states that report party registration , like @entity7			2
but in @entity99 , where registration is required only in primaries , the parties rely on different indicators , like returns in key strongholds			0
@entity99 touts early voting numbers and there is encouraging news for both : in @entity142 and @entity143 counties , two urban centers around @entity139 and @entity140 respectively , early voting shows heavy turnout in the areas that helped secure the state for @entity38 in 2008			2
the state is mailing absentee ballot applications to voters for the first time this year and @entity32 said that could be affecting increased returns in rural areas , which are more heavily @entity22			2
in rural areas of @entity99 , absentee ballots sent to each registered voter in the state for the first time in 2012 also show increased turnout			1
in @entity161 , the largest in the state and home to @entity37 - heavy @entity164 , nearly 250,000 absentee ballots have been requested and some 80,000 have been returned			0
those numbers strongly favor @entity15 : 47,538 to 16,720			2
@entity22 officials say their absentee and in - person voting turnout in @entity143 is coming along nicely			1
@entity22 account for 16.5 % of registered voters there , but make up 28.6 % of early voting activity so far			1
still , @entity32 said looking that the numbers now is " like reading tea leaves			0
" it is also still too early to decipher returns in @entity100 , which began early voting on thursday			2
if voting stays pace with projections from early voting experts , 5 % to 10 % more than the 30 % or 130 million @entity1 who voted early in 2008 will have voted before november 6 , according to early voting experts			1
