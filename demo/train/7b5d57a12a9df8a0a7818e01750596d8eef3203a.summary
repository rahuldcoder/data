-- there is n't just one @entity3 national convention that started on tuesday ; there are four of them going on			1
there 's the convention for the base , which is why @entity9 and @entity10 were up there , and why the day was suffused with religion			1
then there 's the convention for the undecided -- or as they are called now , the persuadables			2
@entity17 and @entity18 were the headliners for this bunch			2
mrs. @entity17 's role was to be the humanizer - in - chief , and the governor 's role was to bring his blunt charm to independents looking for a lack of posturing and pandering			2
as the week progresses , other speakers will be carefully chosen for their ability to get fence - sitters to climb in their direction			2
of course , there 's also the convention for the media , which in many ways might be the most important audience of all			1
there are 15,000 journalists in @entity41 -- @entity42 accused them of squandering " ego - dollars			2
" since their coverage will influence a lot more people than actually saw the proceedings , their lens becomes the national lens			0
lastly , there 's the convention for everyone else			0
that 's most of @entity56 , but most of the country does n't really care that much , which is why " @entity61 " on @entity62 pulled in more than 4 million - plus viewers than their convention coverage managed to scrape together			1
those are a lot of masters to serve , which is why the first night of the convention came across as such a fragmented affair			1
there were strands of a narrative -- end the culture of dependency , do n't let us turn into @entity75 , @entity3 policies help immigrants succeed , you can trust @entity78 -- but the strands were stranded , lacking a big cohering theme			1
what @entity81 said about @entity17 's speech actually describes the entire evening , that it was " scattered , full of declarations ... that were n't built upon but abandoned			1
" there were a few moments of strong @entity3 branding last night ; i thought the best single line came from @entity18 , when he said " i believe we have become paralyzed by our desire to be loved			1
" in the era of counting @entity96 friends and @entity97 follows , that 's a message that cuts across parties and that speaks to everyone who in their heart knows and understands the risks of striving for popularity			1
it 's also a smart way to turn president @entity107 's superior likeability numbers against him , although it 's doubtful that @entity110 's lower numbers are based on his willingness to trade off short - term favorability ratings for unpopular stances			0
@entity18 is building his own political brand around a persona of strident rejection of the seductions of being an object of political eroticism ( he is the anti-clinton in that regard			0
) but the trouble for the @entity3 is that the counterpoint to the " desire to be loved " -- what @entity18 described as " strengths greater than the passions and emotions of the times " -- is exactly what many find lacking in his candidate			1
if political parties are essentially brands -- and they are -- then contemporary political conventions should be occasions when those brands are both strengthened and nuanced			1
but they rarely are -- the " bump " is notoriously ephemeral			0
there 's a reason for that			0
successful brands -- those that are both enduring and changing below the surface -- have a strong hand at the controls			0
not dozens of self - interested brand managers which their own constituencies , which is the way politics operates			1
great brands -- @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , you name it -- are not created and managed by committees			0
but that is exactly and literally what the parties are : the @entity162 ; the @entity163			0
the flaws of " design by committee " are so well - known that they even have their own wikipedia page			0
parties out of office , by definition , find it harder to create and project a unified , focused brand identity			0
the lack of a leader , an ability to hand out plum jobs , bitter infighting and posturing for the next election , are all brand - destructive			0
the 2008 @entity182 , despite a bitter primary battle between @entity107 and @entity181 , was an exception			0
their titanic battle was one of personality more than a debate on the issues , so the core of the party was n't riven by the fractiousness that comes from being out of power			1
@entity107 's singularity and aura of personal mission projected a massively powerful @entity163 brand ; in fact , it 's the emotional investment in the @entity107 brand that the @entity3 are now trying to turn against the president			1
it 's a potent weapon ; disillusionment stings			0
it was n't the @entity182 that won in 2008 , it was @entity107			2
the personal brand was more potent than the party 's			2
now we face the reverse			0
in 2012 , the @entity3 lack a commanding personal brand at the top of the ticket , and it remains to be seen if their political brand is strong enough to overcome that absence			1
there 's nothing i 've seen , from the brand theater of @entity41 -- including an inability to cut to anything but older white faces in the crowd -- that looks all that encouraging			0
there are too many brand managers in the party , and at the party			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229 .			1

@entity229 : these are four @entity3 conventions in one , playing to different *groups*
he says the party is aiming at the base , undecideds , the media and everyone else
he says @entity3 has fragmented message with too many masters
@entity229 : can politics win anyway ? so far it does n't look good
