two portraits have emerged of @entity3 terror suspect @entity2 , whose trial begins monday			1
there 's @entity2 the bloodied fugitive , captured by police with rifle lasers tagging his head as he surrendered from a tarp - covered boat in a homeowner 's backyard			1
that ended a massive manhunt for suspects four days after a pair of crude pressure - cooker bombs killed three people and injured 264 more			0
prosecutors say the ideology of @entity22 extremists motivated him and that he knew what he was doing when he planted a bomb at the marathon 's crowded finish line in april 2013			0
then there 's @entity2 smiling from the cover of @entity30 , a young man who prosecutors say fell under the sway of a manipulative older brother bent on jihad			1
defense attorneys have suggested @entity2 was controlled by that brother , 26 - year - old @entity37 , who was killed in a confrontation with police three days after the bombing			1
the younger drove over the older brother and escaped			1
defense attorneys also have said the family 's history played a role in shaping @entity2			1
they note that the family , of @entity48 ethnicity , experienced difficulties dating to @entity50 , when @entity51 deported mass populations to central @entity53			0
the death of @entity37 leaves @entity2 , now 21 , to stand trial alone			1
jury selection is scheduled to begin monday in a trial that could last months			1
he has pleaded not guilty to more than 30 federal charges , including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death			1
" prosecutors appear to have virtually incontrovertible evidence supporting their claim that @entity2 and his brother , @entity68 , planned and executed the @entity69 , " said @entity1 legal analyst @entity63 , a former prosecutor and defense attorney			1
" the defense , on the other hand , will push for a more expansive ' @entity73 ' type presentation to create a narrative that paints @entity2 as the innocent pawn of a domineering older brother , " @entity63 added			1
" a more expansive presentation of @entity2 's family and psychological history is more likely to be seen during the sentencing phase if the jury returns a guilty verdict			1
" read the indictment high - profile public defender heightening the stakes is how the trial is a capital case , meaning that if a federal jury finds @entity2 guilty in the terror attack , he will face a separate proceeding on whether he should be executed			1
seventeen of the charges carry the death penalty or a maximum of life in prison			0
" there will be a guilt phase of this case , you know , whether the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity2 was the bomber , " @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity98 said			2
if @entity2 is found guilty , " then there will be a small , separate mini-trial " on whether he should receive the death penalty , @entity98 added			2
if so , @entity2 will benefit from one of the most prominent attorneys in high - profile capital cases			2
she 's federal public defender @entity110 , whom @entity98 described as " a legendary death penalty defense lawyer			0
" @entity112 fought for the lives of several notorious criminals , including " @entity115 " @entity115 and @entity117 rampage gunman @entity116 , who seriously wounded former @entity120 rep. @entity119			0
both received a life sentence with no chance for parole in exchange for guilty pleas			0
learn more about @entity110 the @entity3 bombings were extensively photographed and videotaped			0
in fact , @entity2 's legal team sought to relocate the trial outside @entity131 , but the court ruled no. as it turns out , holding the trial in @entity136 ' capital city could carry an advantage for @entity2 if he faces a death penalty			2
@entity131 is a politically liberal city with strong opposition to the death penalty , analysts say			0
prosecution : a ' mass destruction ' bomber in contrast to portrayals of @entity2 as a manipulated youngster from a troubled family , prosecutors cast him as a deliberate killer inspired by jihadi literature who inflicted terror at the @entity3			1
@entity2 " knowingly conspired with @entity37 to use a weapon of mass destruction " and " knowingly and unlawfully delivered , placed , discharged and detonated an explosive " in public place , the indictment alleges			1
at the time of the attacks , @entity2 was a student at the @entity157			2
his dorm room contained evidence on his computer and a backpack of fireworks that had been emptied of their powder , prosecutors allege			0
the brothers @entity2 began their plot at least two months before the attacks , the indictment says , when the elder sibling bought 48 mortars containing about eight pounds of explosive powder from a fireworks store in @entity174 , @entity175 , in february 2013			2
the younger @entity2 allegedly downloaded a copy of @entity178 magazine , an @entity180 online publication of @entity181 , a terrorist organization based in @entity182			2
it contained detailed instructions on how to build an improvised explosive device with pressure cookers , explosive powder from fireworks , shrapnel and other materials , prosecutors charge			0
@entity2 allegedly placed a backpack concealing one pressure cooker bomb in front of the @entity195 on @entity196			2
he then called his older brother on a cell phone			1
one minute after that phone call , the older brother allegedly detonated a bomb that he had planted , and , seconds later , the younger brother detonated the bomb he had planted , which killed two people , the indictment charges			1
after the bombing , the brothers killed a @entity210 police officer by shooting him in the head at close range , the indictment alleges			0
writing on the wall when @entity2 hid in the stowed boat in @entity215 , @entity136 , he wrote several incriminating declarations on an inside wall and its beams , according to the indictment : " we @entity221 are one body , you hurt one you hurt us all			2
" now i do n't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in @entity22 but due to said ( unintelligible ) it is allowed			0
" stop killing innocent people and we will stop			0
" the @entity120 government is killing our innocent civilians			0
" i ca n't stand to see such evil go unpunished			0
" his older brother was buried in a @entity221 cemetery in @entity231 , @entity232 , after cemeteries in @entity136 and elsewhere refused to bury him			1
' older brother as an all - powerful force ' defense attorneys suggest in court documents that their client succumbed to his domineering older brother			1
the legal team does n't declare a defense strategy , but they paint a portrait of @entity2 in a court motion in march arguing how the jury should hear evidence about relative culpability and whether the younger brother fell under the " domination and control " of the elder one			1
potential evidence could show the older brother as someone who " induced or coerced his younger brother to help commit " the attacks , the defense team says in papers			1
the never - proved accusation that @entity37 participated in a 2011 triple murder whose victims included a close friend " would powerfully support the inference that @entity2 experienced his older brother as an all - powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed , " court papers say			1
in making that assertion , the defense attorneys requested access to @entity270 interview notes with a friend of @entity37 , @entity272 , who was killed by an @entity270 agent a month after the bombings			0
the agent was questioning @entity275 about the older @entity2			2
an environment of ' fear , suspicion and fear ' the defense attorneys also point to how the family patriarch 's emotional and mental health issues may have adversely affected both brothers			0
in seeking the disclosure of the family 's @entity120 political asylum files and other evidence , the attorneys address how " favorable mitigation evidence bearing on a capital defendant 's formative environment and mental functioning can take many forms			0
" that includes " psychological domination of one family member , " " evidence of pervasive and longstanding distortions of reality that controlling members of a family impose upon the family unit as a whole " and " growing up in a close environment of pretense , suspicion and fear			0
" for example , @entity2 's father , @entity311 , " had been arbitrarily arrested and tortured in the family 's home country of @entity309 " and " had a well - founded fear of further persecution justifying political asylum in the @entity120 , " the defense states in court papers			1
@entity316 's ' mental and physical afflictions ' on sons even before that , forebears of the @entity2 family had been deported during @entity50 to a remote region of central @entity53 by @entity51 , then leader of the @entity320 , defense court papers say			2
@entity2 's immediate family hailed originally from the @entity327 republic of @entity328 but fled warfare in the 1990s to move to neighboring @entity327 republics			0
the family then relocated to the @entity120			0
" the profoundly destabilizing effect on @entity311 's post-traumatic stress disorder and his other mental and physical afflictions on the @entity2 family 's life in @entity120 is a critical part of the developmental histories of both of @entity311 's sons , " defense papers argued			2
@entity120 district judge @entity342 largely disagreed , however			0
he rejected the defense motion to compel the discovery of the asylum documents and other materials , but said he would review the @entity270 files to determine " what will be produced to the defendant			0

prosecutors portray @entity2 as willful conspirator of mass destruction
defense say his older brother was " an all - powerful force who could not be ignored "
trial is scheduled to begin with jury selection on monday
