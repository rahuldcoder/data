@entity0 -- media magnate @entity4 's flagship @entity3 sunday tabloid newspaper officially apologized sunday for hacking into voice mails , in a scandal which has affected celebrities , politicians and royal household staff			1
the weekly newspaper offered compensation and " apologized unreservedly " for the " unacceptable " hacking			1
but at least one of the victims is rejecting the deal , her lawyer told @entity1 sunday			1
@entity20 , who used to work for celebrity publicist @entity21 , has refused a payout offer , lawyer @entity19 said			1
" she ... needs a declaration of the truth , " @entity19 told @entity1			0
" if i said i will give you 50,000 pounds ( $ 82,000 ) , but you have no way of knowing how many times your phone was hacked , you have no way of knowing how much damage was done			0
" he declined to say how much she had been offered , citing the terms of a letter @entity34 received on friday from @entity35 , the @entity37 's parent company			1
she is one of several @entity19 clients suing over the scandal			2
@entity19 said none of his other clients had received offers of compensation			2
he represents " @entity46 " host @entity45 , among others			0
@entity35 , which also owns the @entity48 and the @entity49 , friday apologized for the widespread phone hacking scandal			1
@entity4 's empire also encompasses the @entity52 , the @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity56 publishers			1
actress @entity57 on april 5 won a court case to access phone records to see if her phone had been hacked			1
that same day , @entity0 's @entity62 arrested two men " on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting mobile phone voice mail messages " on april 5 , they said			2
@entity3 media identified them as @entity67 , a former assistant editor of @entity37 , and @entity69 , its chief reporter			1
by law , @entity3 police do not name people who have been arrested			0
former @entity3 prime minister @entity76 wrote to police last summer to ask if his voice mail had been hacked into , a source close to the situation told @entity1 in january			0
police declined to say whether @entity76 had written to them or what action they took			0
a spokeswoman for @entity76 would not comment on the record			0
@entity35 issued a similar apology friday : " following an extensive internal investigation and disclosures through civil legal cases , @entity35 has decided to approach some civil litigants with an unreserved apology and an admission of liability in cases meeting specific criteria			1
" the company added that it has asked its lawyers to set up a compensation fund to deal with " justifiable " claims -- but would contest cases that it believed were without merit			2
" that said , past behaviour at the @entity37 in relation to voice mail interception is a matter of genuine regret			1
it is now apparent that our previous inquiries failed to uncover important evidence and we acknowledge our actions then were not sufficiently robust			0
" we continue to co-operate fully with the @entity62			0
it was our discovery and voluntary disclosure of this evidence in january that led to the re-opening of the police investigation			0
" with that investigation on going , we can not comment further until its completion			0
" in january , prime minister @entity117 's spokesman stepped down amid speculation he had known about the hacking -- something he has always denied			2
@entity121 was the editor of the @entity37 in 2007 when royal correspondent @entity122 and private investigator @entity123 were sentenced to prison for hacking into voice mails of members of the royal family 's staff			1
@entity122 also admitted hacking into the messages of model @entity130			0
@entity121 denied knowing about the hacking but resigned from the paper because @entity122 ultimately worked for him			2
he was later hired to be @entity117 's spokesman , a position he quit earlier this year after an extensive @entity136 investigation reignited the scandal			2
@entity117 said @entity121 was stepping down because of the continuing pressures on him and his family			0
the former newspaper editor also believed that the focus surrounding the issue was " impeding his ability to do his job and was starting to prove a distraction for the government , " @entity117 added			0
the @entity136 alleged in its story last year that -- far from @entity122 and @entity123 being lone culprits -- phone hacking was common practice at the newspaper			0
one of the few sources who went on the record in the @entity49 article , former @entity37 journalist @entity156 , said @entity121 , then his boss at the tabloid , " actively encouraged me " to hack into the voice mails of public figures to get stories for the @entity37			1
but @entity121 's allies have cast doubt on @entity156 's credibility since the @entity49 article came out september 1 , pointing out that @entity156 was fired from the paper over allegations of drug and alcohol abuse			1
a @entity3 parliamentary committee has also investigated the tabloid			0
@entity174 executives insisted in parliamentary testimony that illegal hacking into voice mail messages was not a widespread practice at @entity37			1
@entity1 's @entity179 contributed to this report .			2
