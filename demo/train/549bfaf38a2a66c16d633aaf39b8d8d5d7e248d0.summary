@entity0 -- president @entity2 on monday appeared to call out @entity3 over what he said about going after @entity5 on the campaign trail four years ago , as opposed to on the eve of the first anniversary of the raid that killed the terrorist leader			1
asked about @entity3 's comments earlier in the day that the decision to go after @entity5 was a clear one and that " even @entity15 would " have made the call , @entity2 referred to a difference between what @entity3 said during his 2008 presidential campaign and on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack			1
" i assume that people meant what they said when they said it , " @entity2 said during a joint appearance with @entity23 prime minister @entity22			1
" that 's been at least my practice			0
i said that i 'd go after @entity5 if we had a clear shot at him , and i did			1
if there are others who said one thing and now suggest they 'd do something else , i 'd go ahead and let them explain			0
" @entity2 also appeared to take exception with a reporter 's question that suggested there was excessive celebration around the anniversary of the @entity43 leader 's death , repeating a charge that @entity45 have made			1
" i hardly think that you 've seen any excessive celebration taking place , " @entity2 said			2
" i think that the @entity50 people likely remember what we as a country accomplished in bringing to justice somebody who killed over 3,000 of our citizens			0
" @entity3 's spokeswoman , @entity56 , responded in a statement that @entity2 was using the anniversary of @entity5 's death as " a cheap political ploy " that she said distorted @entity3 's policies on fighting terrorism			1
" while the @entity2 administration has naively stated that ' the war on terror is over , ' gov. @entity3 has always understood we need a comprehensive plan to deal with the myriad threats @entity50 faces , " @entity62 said			1
@entity69 killed @entity5 on may 2 , 2011 during a raid in @entity71			2
the war of words around the @entity5 death anniversary started last week when @entity2 's campaign made it an issue in a web ad that questioned whether @entity3 would make the same call in the @entity79			1
former president @entity80 narrates parts of the video , in which he praises @entity2 's decision to order the attack			2
it also points out @entity3 saying in 2007 that , " it 's not worth moving heaven and earth , spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person			2
" days later , he said , " we 'll move everything to get him ( @entity5 )			2
" asked by a reporter at an event monday morning whether he would have made the call , @entity3 said " of course " he would have			1
" even @entity15 would have given that order			0
" surrogates took up the argument over the @entity5 raid on the sunday talk shows			2
senior @entity2 campaign adviser @entity103 defended the campaign , while senior @entity3 adviser @entity105 characterized it as a " bridge too far			1
" @entity103 , the former @entity107 press secretary , said the video was " not over the line " and criticized comments @entity3 made on the issue during his first @entity107 bid as " foolish			1
" " there 's a difference in the roles they would play as commander in chief , and i certainly think that 's fair game , " @entity103 said sunday on @entity114 's " @entity113			0
" @entity105 , a former aide to president @entity122 and former chairman of the @entity124 , said using the raid for political purposes is one of the reasons @entity2 has " become one of the most divisive presidents in @entity50 history			2
" " he took something that was a unifying event for all @entity50 , and he 's managed to turn it into a divisive , partisan political attack , " @entity105 said in a separate interview on the same @entity114 program			0
" i think most @entity50 will see it as a sign of a desperate campaign			0
" the day @entity5 died @entity140 sen. @entity139 , @entity2 's 2008 opponent , called the minute - long spot " a cheap political attack ad			1
" @entity107 counterterrorism adviser @entity143 avoided politics and praised the president 's decision - making skills on the talk shows and in an address monday at the @entity149			0
" one year ago today , president @entity2 faced the scenario that he discussed here at the @entity149 five years ago , and he did not hesitate to act , " he said			2
" the death of @entity5 was our most strategic blow yet against @entity43 , " @entity143 said			2
" credit for that success belongs to the courageous forces who carried out that mission , at extraordinary risk to their lives ; to the many intelligence professionals who pieced together the clues that led to @entity5 's hideout ; and to president @entity2 , who gave the order to go in			1
" vice president @entity168 previewed the theme in a thursday campaign - style address			0
" if you are looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how president @entity2 has handled what we inherited , it 's pretty simple : @entity5 is dead , and @entity178 is alive , " he said during a speech at @entity177			1
@entity80 appeared in a fundraiser with @entity2 on sunday night , characterizing @entity3 as " an opponent who basically wants to do what they did before -- on steroids			1
which will get you the same consequences you got before -- on steroids			0
" @entity2 will pick up the message with what the campaign has billed as his re-election kick - off saturday			2
he is expected to attend campaign rallies in @entity194 , @entity195 , and @entity196 , @entity197 , two likely battleground states in the november election			0
he cited @entity199 on monday as he rallied building trade union members , trying to draw a distinction between the conservative icon and the @entity45 that the president is running against now			1
" @entity199 once said that rebuilding our infrastructure is common sense ; an investment in tomorrow that we need to make today , " @entity2 told the @entity207			1

sen. @entity238 of @entity239 got the vp scrutiny treatment last week when he appeared with @entity3 in @entity242			0
