@entity5 , 33 , was picked up by police last thursday after several people reported a man running along a @entity14 , @entity15 , street in his underwear , screaming , sources said			1
" @entity5 's incident was in no way the result of drugs or alcohol in his body , " the family statement said			1
" the preliminary diagnosis he received is called brief reactive psychosis , an acute state brought on by extreme exhaustion , stress and dehydration			0
" @entity5 's family said his doctors told them it was " a common experience given the great mental , emotional and physical shock his body has gone through in these last two weeks			1
" " even for us , it 's hard to understand the sudden transition from relative anonymity to worldwide attention -- both raves and ridicules , in a matter of days , " their statement said			0
the filmmaker " has a long way to go , but we are confident that he will make a full recovery , " his family said			0
" he is , and will remain , under hospital care for a number of weeks ; and after that , the recovery process could take months before he is fully able to step back into his role with @entity55 , " it said			2
" during that time , we will focus not on a speedy recovery , but a thorough one			0
" @entity5 is one of the founders of the @entity14 - based nonprofit group @entity55 , which produced the half - hour film about warlord @entity60			1
" @entity69 " skyrocketed to popularity on @entity62 , propelled by thousands of posts on @entity64 and @entity65 , garnering nearly 85 million views since its march 5 release			1
the popularity of the film led to a flurry of media appearances for @entity5 and his fellow @entity55 co-founders and prompted scrutiny from some who argued that the social media frenzy was too little , too late			1
