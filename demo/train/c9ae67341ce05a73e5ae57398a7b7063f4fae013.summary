the blast also wounded two others , @entity10 said			2
state television channel @entity17 reported later wednesday that @entity15 's driver , @entity18 , had died in a hospital from his injuries			1
@entity21 , @entity1 ambassador to the @entity22 , condemned what he called " cruel , inhumane and criminal acts of terrorism against the @entity1 scientists			2
" " based on the existing evidence collected by the relevant @entity1 security authorities , similar to previous incidents , perpetrators used the same terrorist method in assassinating @entity1 nuclear scientists , i.e. , attaching a sticky magnetic bomb to the car carrying the scientists and detonating it , " @entity21 said in a statement			1
" i would like to emphasize , once again , that the @entity36 ( of ) @entity1 would not compromise over its inalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and any kind of political and economic pressures or terrorist attacks targeting the @entity1 nuclear scientists , could not prevent our nation in exercising this right , " @entity21 said			2
lawmaker @entity45 blamed the intelligence agencies of the @entity47 and @entity8 for the latest attack , saying the @entity22 ' nuclear watchdog , the @entity50 , also bore responsibility for passing on information about @entity1 's nuclear scientists to other countries , @entity10 reports			1
@entity47 secretary of state @entity58 , speaking alongside the @entity56 foreign minister in @entity57 , rejected the claims			1
" i want to categorically deny any @entity47 involvement in any kind of act of violence inside @entity1 , " she said			1
" we believe there has to be an understanding between @entity1 , its neighbors and the international community that finds a way forward for it to end its provocative behavior , end its search for nuclear weapons and rejoin the international community and be a productive member of it			0
" @entity8 does not normally comment on such claims			0
however , @entity77 gen. @entity78 , a spokesman for the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) , said on his @entity81 page wednesday : " i have no idea who targeted the @entity1 scientist but i certainly do n't shed a tear			2
" @entity15 , 32 , was a deputy director for commercial affairs at the @entity88 uranium enrichment facility in @entity89 and a graduate of @entity1 's @entity91 , according to the semi-official news agency @entity92			1
@entity88 , which is said to have 8,000 centrifuges in operation , is one of two facilities that is enriching uranium in the country			0
this week , the @entity50 identified the second in the mountains of @entity101			0
@entity103 diplomats at the @entity22 on wednesday criticized @entity1 over the recent revelation that @entity0 is enriching uranium beyond the level needed for civilian use , saying that the actions flaunt @entity110 resolutions			0
the @entity110 discussed the issue in closed consultations			0
" we have very serious concerns about this blatant disregard for fulfillment of their international obligations , " said @entity113 , deputy @entity47 ambassador to the @entity22 " the location , the size and the clandestine nature of the facility at @entity101 raise serious doubts about what its ultimate purposes are , " added @entity120 , deputy @entity121 ambassador to the @entity22 the @entity50 announced on monday its finding that @entity1 is enriching uranium at a previously secret facility to 20 % purity			1
diplomats said that further @entity110 sanctions were possible			0
but they indicated that they are focusing on ensuring that the sanctions already in place are enforced			0
they emphasized the need for a negotiated solution to the standoff			0
" a year ago we passed very strict sanctions on @entity1 , the most comprehensive ever , " @entity113 said			0
" those sanctions are being implemented , and president @entity144 himself has acknowledged to his own parliament that they 're having an impact			0
" officials in the @entity47 and other @entity103 nations have ratcheted up sanctions against @entity0 since a november report by the @entity50 said the @entity1 government was developing the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon			1
last month , @entity47 president @entity155 announced sanctions against @entity1 's central bank			1
@entity0 maintains its nuclear program is for civilian energy purposes only			0
but the @entity50 has said it can not verify whether the intent of @entity0 's nuclear program remains peaceful			0
the attack comes at a time when relations between @entity1 and the @entity47 have rarely been as strained			1
@entity1 sentenced @entity1 - @entity47 and former @entity166 @entity165 to death tuesday for alleged espionage , prompting strong condemnation from the @entity170			1
@entity1 also aggravated tensions in the past month with its threat to close the strategically important @entity173 if @entity103 nations carry through with sanctions on its oil industry to punish @entity0 's lack of cooperation on its nuclear program			2
in comments wednesday , @entity181 deputy foreign minister @entity182 urged @entity103 nations and @entity1 to avoid escalating the situation further , @entity181 's official @entity180 news agency reported			1
responding to wednesday 's bombing , @entity1 's first vice president @entity186 said the attacks against scientists would not stop the country from achieving its goals , @entity10 reported			1
" @entity1 scientists become more determined to take steps in line with the aspirations of the @entity36 in spite of terrorist operations , " @entity186 told the news agency			1
the attack followed a similar mode of operation as others that have killed nuclear scientists in @entity1 's capital city			1
and on january 12 , 2010 , @entity1 university professor and nuclear scientist @entity206 died in a blast when an assailant stuck a bomb under his car			2
@entity212 , an @entity1 , reportedly confessed to the bombing and was sentenced to death in august , @entity10 reported at the time			2
prosecutors accused him of working for @entity8 's spy agency @entity218 and said he was paid $ 120,000 by @entity8 to carry out the hit , @entity92 news agency reported			1
@entity8 does not comment on such claims			0
in november 2010 , nuclear scientist @entity221 was killed in a blast where , again , a bomb was stuck under a car by someone on a motorcycle			0
another nuclear scientist , prof. @entity229 , and his wife were injured in a similar attack			0
@entity232 is now director of the @entity233			0
" the bomb used in the ( wednesday ) explosion was a magnetic bomb , the same kind that were used in previous assassinations of @entity1 scientists			1
and the fact is that this is the work of the @entity242 , " @entity92 news agency quoted @entity0 's deputy gov. @entity239 as saying			1
@entity1 uses the term " zionist " to refer to @entity8			2
@entity1 has been engaged in a war of words with @entity8 , whom it accuses of trying to destabilize the republic			2
@entity249 , a former director of the @entity1 department in the @entity251 , told @entity252 that wednesday 's attack was part of broader pressure being brought to bear on president @entity144 's regime			2
" many bad things have been happening to @entity1 in the recent period			0
@entity1 is in a situation where pressure on it is mounting , and the latest assassination joins the pressure that the @entity1 regime is facing , " @entity249 said			0
the @entity265 reported wednesday that the @entity8 military chief of staff @entity269 , speaking at a @entity268 @entity267 meeting , warned that " 2012 will be a critical year in the connection between @entity1 gaining nuclear power , changes in leadership , continuing pressure from the international community and events that happen unnaturally			1
" @entity278 , a professor at the @entity279 at @entity281 's @entity280 , said more information is needed about the victims to help determine who 's perpetrating the attacks			0
some have speculated that the victims were members of the opposition movement and could have been targeted by internal forces , @entity278 said			0
" but if it is true that @entity8 is behind it , @entity1 should make a formal complaint to the @entity22 so they can get an answer from @entity8 , " @entity278 said			2
" because if they really think some other country is killing their nuclear experts , why are they not giving them more protection ? " @entity2 's @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 and @entity303 contributed to this report .			0
