@entity0 -- in another public embarrassment for the @entity5 's nuclear missile program , two crew members were disciplined earlier this year for leaving silo blast doors open while they were on duty in an underground facility housing nuclear missiles			1
the incidents , first reported by the @entity10 , were confirmed wednesday by the @entity5			2
under @entity5 regulations , a two - man missile launch crew is required to keep the underground blast door shut when one crew member is asleep during the 24 - hour shift			1
in april a crew member was found " derelict in his duties in that he left the blast door open in order to receive a food delivery from the onsite chef " while the other crew member was on an authorized sleep break , @entity5 spokesman lt. col. @entity16 said in a statement			1
the crew member who was found " derelict " received a punishment of forfeiting $ 2,246 in pay for each of two months			0
the other crew member admitted to similar misconduct " on a few occasions " and received a letter of admonishment			0
the april incident occurred at @entity37 in @entity38 in may , at @entity40 in @entity41 , a maintenance team was allowed into an underground launch control center while one crew member was sleeping , in violation of rules			0
in this case , the commander of the crew , when questioned about the incident , told the deputy to lie about being asleep , which she initially did , according to officials			0
the incident was investigated , and both crew members were disciplined			2
the commander is forfeiting $ 3,045 in pay for each of two months and facing a discharge board			0
the silo blast doors are at the bottom of a shaft that leads to the launch control center			1
the heavy - duty blast doors are meant to protect the launch control center in event of a nuclear blast			1
that center controls up to 10 missile silos			0
@entity5 officials insist security was not compromised in these incidents because there are multiple layers of security above ground that would keep unauthorized personnel from gaining access to a launch control center			1
the centers are generally 40 feet to 100 feet underground , and the two - man crew controls as many as 10 missile silos			2
there also are multiple layers of security surrounding nuclear launch codes			0
but the disclosures come on the heels of the firing of the two - star general in charge of the @entity5 's three nuclear wings			1
earlier this month , maj. gen. @entity85 was " relieved " of command " due to a loss of trust and confidence in his leadership and judgment , " the @entity5 said at the time			2
@entity85 's removal had to do with reports of alleged misbehavior on a business trip			0
in august , one of the @entity5 's nuclear wings failed a safety and security inspection and a separate wing did poorly in an inspection earlier in the year , which resulted in 17 military personnel being decertified from their jobs			1
they have since undergone retraining and are back at work .			0
