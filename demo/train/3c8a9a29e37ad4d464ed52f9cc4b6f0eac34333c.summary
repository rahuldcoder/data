@entity0 has learned a key characteristic to succeeding in both politics and entertainment : not revealing too much			1
the " @entity16 " creator , show runner and primary writer talks freely about his show , which concerns a powerful @entity9 congressman , @entity10 ( @entity11 ) , and his maneuvers to get his way in the conniving world of @entity15			1
but ask @entity0 something basic , such as the premiere date of the popular @entity21 series ' second season , and he offers an elegant " no comment			1
" " i ca n't give you that tidbit right now , unfortunately , " the former campaign aide says in a phone interview with @entity27 , occasionally straining to be heard over the roar of military helicopters			0
but @entity0 , 35 , is willing to talk about plenty of other things : the show 's @entity33 nominations -- including best drama -- the value of power , the balance between idealism and cynicism and who some of his models are			1
the @entity45 - nominated producer and playwright ( his " @entity47 " was turned into the @entity49 film " @entity50 " ) talked to @entity27 last week			0
the following is an edited version of the interview			0
@entity27 : were you surprised by the @entity33 recognition ? @entity0 : i always keep my expectations pretty low			1
i believed and i know everyone on our team believed we had done a good job and we were curious to see whether the television academy agreed , and we were thrilled when they did			0
that 's the icing on the cake , and it tastes pretty good			1
@entity21 joins the @entity33 club @entity27 : how much of your political experience has shaped " @entity16 " ? @entity0 : my jobs on campaigns were pretty low on the totem pole -- i was an advance man			1
but a number of my friends , including my best friend , @entity75 , who is a political consultant on the show , were in the upper tiers and really knew what was going on			1
( also , ) i built up a lot of relationships in @entity15 and the political world in general , and i draw from that all the time			0
and when any of my friends are n't sure about something , they usually know the person who is			0
it 's a rough - and - tumble game whenever power is involved -- people 's ambitions , their desires , their competitive spirit will often push them to play outside the rules			1
it 's dramatic , it 's interesting , and i think it 's something we can all identify with to a degree			1
@entity27 : some rule - breaking on the show seems par for the course , and some might be beyond the pale			1
@entity0 : well , beyond the pale ethically for most people , sure			1
but not beyond the pale in terms of reality			0
that 's an extreme version , but in the history of humanity , a lot of heads have rolled in order for people to ascend to the throne			1
@entity27 : what sources have you relied on ? @entity0 : inspiration is drawn from books like ( @entity121 's @entity120 biography and @entity122 's " @entity118 " ) , and other times it 's talking to people who worked in that world			1
i really do n't think it 's a show about politics at all			1
it 's a show about power			1
and that power is displayed in our love lives , or our work environments , the way we comport ourselves when randomness brushes up against us			2
@entity27 : @entity10 often says that he prefers power over money			1
do you have any personal views on that , given the influence money has in @entity15 nowadays ? @entity0 : there 's certainly a lot of overlap , right ? to a degree , money is a form of power			1
but i think the differentiation he 's drawing is what the end goal is			2
for some people the end goal is money			0
and then you see people like @entity10 who do n't deny the importance of money , but that 's not the reason he gets up in the morning			1
money is finite , it 's limited by a number and what you can buy with it			2
power has no limits if you 're willing to go far enough in order to get as much of it as you can			0
@entity27 : i wanted good things to happen to certain characters			0
i can be a cynic but i guess i want to be an idealist			0
is the show cynical ? @entity0 : i do n't consider myself to be a cynic nor the show to be cynical			1
in fact , @entity10 is an optimist			1
where i think people mistake his optimism for cynicism is that he 's unapologetically self - interested			2
he believes ideology is a form of weakness -- a form of cowardice			0
it hems you in in ways that do n't allow you to be flexible			0
and inflexibility is anathema to progress			0
the problem with @entity15 right now is that people are too stuck to their ideology			0
when you have both parties who will not find ways to compromise , who wo n't meet in the middle , you have paralysis			0
it 's the perversion of idealism			2
i think what @entity10 has done is liberate himself from belief systems altogether			1
he says , i 've got people over here who think this , and people over there who think that			0
i 'm going to find ways -- whether it 's through persuasion or seduction or intimidation or blackmail , whatever my tactics are -- to make sure everyone moves forward			2
i think that 's attractive to people			2
one of the comments we often get is people root for @entity10 because he actually gets things done			1
he makes an argument for the ends justifying the means			0
@entity27 : have you gotten much reaction from the actual denizens of @entity15 ? @entity0 : sure			1
a lot of people in @entity15 have watched the show and think it 's one of the more authentic portrayals they 've ever seen			1
we definitely push the limits of probability , but everything that happens on the show is more or less plausible			2
and we do n't shy away from the nuts and bolts and nitty - gritty of what it takes to get things done			0
and sometimes it 's ugly			2
@entity27 : i do find the sausage - making ugly			0
when i watch the show , and @entity10 talks about " looking weak , " i 'd be the person he 's talking about			1
@entity0 : @entity10 is an extreme example because he says , i do n't have ideals in the traditional sense			1
i think he sees an intransigent belief system as a form of cowardice because it dictates your behavior for you			0
you do n't have to make hard choices , you do n't have to come up with solutions , you do n't have to compromise , you do n't have to think outside the box			0
that 's like a sanctioned form of impotence that has the appearance of strength , but not if you scratch the surface			2
@entity27 : do you think that news media play too much of a role in making that impotence look strong , because they enjoy conflict ? @entity0 : that 's an interesting question			1
i do n't think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history			0
what the media does is respond to narratives that are already coursing through the nation 's system			2
conflict always makes for a good story , and stories that interest people will always rise to the top of the headlines			0
but i just see that as a function of the media doing what it has always done since the first leaflet was printed -- trying to find its audience and keep them engaged			0
@entity27 : does the binge - watching aspect affect the way you write it or make it ? @entity0 : it 's sort of yes and no. when i first began season 1 , we had not made a decision that we would release all 13 episodes at once			1
so i wrote it thinking it has to be able to work both ways			2
what affected the writing most was knowing we had two seasons guaranteed before i even started			0
i knew we had 26 hours , and there were things i could lay into the very beginning of season 1 that would n't boomerang back to the very end of season 2			1
so it 's knowing you have such a large canvas to paint on			2
@entity27 : is there any political figure or artistic figure you see as a model ? @entity0 : there are so many			1
in terms of political figures , someone we keep going back to for inspiration is @entity120			0
i do n't necessarily say he 's a model for me -- there are aspects of the way he conducted business that i find admirable and others i find abhorrent			2
( but ) i think there 's so much to be gained by digging into this life story			2
it 's an epic @entity341 story that happens to be real			2
as far as models in the arts , one would be the screenwriter @entity344 , who 's a friend and mentor of mine			0
the thing about @entity349 that 's so extraordinary , besides the fact he 's had a career that 's spanned half a century , he continues to keep challenging himself			0
in a similar vein i would say @entity352			0
there you have someone who has such a singular vision and really stuck to it			0
the documentary world is a tough racket			0
the ability to make documentaries that are not only so epic and thorough and artful , but have them reach mainstream audiences -- i find it to be not short of miraculous			0
@entity27 : we saw bits of @entity368 's roots in the first season			1
are we going to see more in season 2 ? @entity0 : i wish i could tell you , but i 'm not going to			1
you 'll have to watch and see .			0
