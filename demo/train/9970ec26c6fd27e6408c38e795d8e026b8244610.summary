@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 @entity3 acknowledges that he is a political activist			1
he admits he has been arrested a couple of times for relatively minor offenses			2
but he insists he 's not a terrorist			1
@entity3 , who describes himself on his @entity10 page as a carpenter with a " veggie farm , " says he has no idea how he wound up on the government 's terrorist watch list			1
he just wants to save the rain forest			0
the only dings on his record , at least as far as he knows , consist of fishing for trout out of season and driving while impaired			0
the 27 - year - old , known as " @entity23 " around @entity0 's activist community , was pulled over sunday near a building where protesters plan their demonstrations			1
he was charged with driving with a revoked license			1
and then he was thrown in jail under exceptionally high bail -- $ 10,000			0
@entity31 : the protester who would be president the arresting officer asked a magistrate to keep him behind bars for the duration of the @entity37 , which ends thursday night			0
he advised against releasing @entity3 on his promise to show up for court			1
" why do you feel suspect is a risk ? " a bail sheet asked , and the officer wrote : " known activist + protester who is currently on a terrorist watch list			1
request he be held due to @entity37 being a @entity48			0
" ( both political conventions received the designation from the federal @entity51			0
it freed up federal funding for security and put the @entity54 in charge			2
) about 800 protesters marched through uptown @entity0 on sunday in the first and largest of a week of demonstrations			0
only a handful of people have been arrested at the convention in @entity0 , and the @entity63 last week in @entity64 , @entity65 -- a sharp contrast to previous years , when hundreds of protesters were arrested			2
but there have been complaints at both conventions that the police presence is excessive , and the high security has chilled free speech			2
@entity3 's arrest has some observers wondering whether police crossed the line to suppress dissent			1
" the question is whether or not the stop and the arrest and the attempt to get an unreasonably high bond amount was really a pretext for a police officer 's selective motivation to censor an individual 's political activity , " said @entity78 , a professor at @entity79			1
" if that 's the case , then you 're in @entity93 territory			2
" he added it will be difficult to prove what was on the officer 's mind when he made what appears to be a legitimate car stop			2
" it 's a question of what evidence is there to determine intent , " @entity78 said			2
" there rarely is a smoking gun when it comes to establishing someone 's unlawful intent in a particular action			2
and you have to rely on circumstantial evidence			0
the circumstantial in this case is a bit suspicious			0
" anarchists @entity116 @entity0 - @entity118 police did not respond to @entity2 's requests for comment			1
@entity122 @entity121 , the @entity118 district attorney , said that while the high bail was " not typical for a revoked license charge , " the court document " heightens our concern for public safety			1
" @entity3 spent sunday night and most of monday in jail			1
he called a legal hot line for protesters and was given an attorney , @entity132			2
the @entity0 lawyer got before a judge , @entity134 , on monday and convinced her to lower @entity3 's bail to $ 2,500			1
he walked free on monday night			0
" i have done nothing wrong and have nothing to hide , " @entity3 said as he left the @entity136			1
" i believe this is an attempt to stifle my first amendment rights and keep my voice from being heard			0
" he said he was no longer interested in protesting during the convention , believing police had targeted him			1
" at this point , " he said , " i would like to go home and visit my parents and play with my dog			0
" @entity3 is a volunteer with the @entity149 and has spoken at @entity151 events , according to the group 's website and @entity155 feeds			1
his attorney said he was jailed in an attempt to muzzle him and prevent him from organizing protests			1
" i firmly believe that mr. @entity3 has been profiled and has been singled out as an organizer , and i believe that the government in this case had the intention of suppressing speech before it was even exercised , " @entity132 said			1
" i think it 's censorship pure and simple , and i have never seen a $ 10,000 cash bond on any kind of traffic charge			1
" i personally believe that this was purely politically motivated , " he said , " solely , solely based on the pretext of getting me off the street , pushing me into a cell and throwing away the key for as long as they possibly could			0
" he owns up to his mistakes , and his brushes with the law			0
5 @entity179 moments at the @entity37 " i have n't been arrested for anything else even remotely political , " he said			0
" the first arrest was for fishing out of season two days			0
i messed up , i was n't looking at the rules right , i apologized			0
i 'm a dedicated catch and release fisherman			0
i love fishing and fish is one of my passions			0
my other arrest was for a dwi , which i really regret			0
but i took responsibility for my actions			0
as a matter of fact , i was two weeks away from finishing my drug and alcohol courses in order to get my license back			2
" but he does n't understand how that got him on the government 's terrorist watch list			1
federal authorities do not discuss how the list is compiled , or even confirm who is on it , according to the @entity51			2
" just being on this list alone is really frightening for me , " @entity3 said			1
" this could potentially affect the rest of my life			0
and they have no cause , they have no cause to do that at all			0
some of the questions that tumble around my head are : ' who 's making these lists ? like where 's the accountability ? why am i on this list ? why are other people on this list ? ' " and most importantly , probably , ' how do i get off this list ? ' " @entity2 's @entity224 contributed to this report .			1
