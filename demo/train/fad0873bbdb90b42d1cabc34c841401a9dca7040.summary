-- i am a long - time fan of reality television : first @entity4 , then , @entity1 , @entity5 , and master chef			2
the mythologist @entity7 provides an explanation for the success of these programs : " a hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder ; fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won ; the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man			1
" is n't this what happens in reality tv ? we see people who are hoping to be called out of their everyday lives to an adventure , to be tested on a road of trials in hopes of obtaining the ultimate boon			2
watching , we find pieces of ourselves mirrored in the contestants ; we , too , are on the mythic journey of a hero			1
our careers are a hero 's journey -- a call to adventure early on , it 's fairly easy to see yourself as the hero			1
i , for example , fancied myself as @entity48 , of the movie @entity50 , having started out as a secretary			0
but mid-career , accepting a beckoning call is far more difficult			1
you likely have achieved some success ; the stakeholders in your life , including you , may be rather attached to the status quo			0
mid-career , the " another day , another dollar mindset " can quickly sideline us if we avoid challenges and the growth our work can bring			0
what 's important to remember here is that the dialing - it - in plateau can be a precipice : we avoid a career - killing plateau by accepting the call to a new adventure			1
it may mean taking a pay - cut , a demotion in terms of job title , or simply striking out into the uncharted waters of entrepreneurship			1
and daunting though it may be , we keep in our intellectual back pocket one of the findings of disruptive innovation theory : the odds of success are six times higher , the revenue opportunity 20 times greater , when we disrupt , and accept the call to adventure			1
see also : is workplace boredom ' the new stress ? ' a road of trials or succession of tough experiences is inevitable often they will come from where we least expect them , one obstacle being entitlement			0
we may believe , for example , that we have the right to a perk or promotion simply because we have shown up ( when we played soccer as kids we all got trophies whether we won or lost , played or sat on the bench ; why would n't this also be true at work ? ) mid-career , we may be inclined to become benevolent dictators to our staff , deciding consensus is n't required			0
after all , we are literally en - titled			0
in battling the dragons of entitlement and complacency , you become the hero of your career			2
when you make and own your choices , fearlessly facing your challenges , you become someone whom others want to follow : " leader " is just another name for hero			0
see also : jumping off the career ladder you are not meant to undertake this journey alone most heroes in literature and film have a guide or a trainer : @entity133 had @entity134 , @entity135 had @entity136 , @entity137 had @entity138 -- guides , who are n't about exploiting you for their gain , but for whom your boon is also theirs			1
if you want to be the hero in your own story , seek out and cultivate the right kind of mentors			1
i could never have made the leap from secretary to professional without the sponsorship of a mentoring boss			0
if you are a professional woman , a guide is even more essential			0
we often measure the success of our career by how much money we make and our job title , and those are important yardsticks -- and an undeniable piece of achieving the boon			0
but a true hero looks to the horizon with a vision of the legacy he or she can leave -- what happens in the life of the company , the people you worked with once you are long gone			2
ultimately the real boon of a hero 's journey is not that others will believe you are a hero , but when you look in the mirror , you will see one			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

our careers are a hero 's journey -- a call to adventure , *argues* @entity182
accepting the call to a new adventure may involve taking a demotion or pay cut , she says
to be the hero in your own story , seek out the right kind of mentors
