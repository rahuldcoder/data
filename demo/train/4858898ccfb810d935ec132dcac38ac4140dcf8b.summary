-- in a typical , unassuming classroom at @entity4 in the suburbs of @entity6 , @entity2 history teacher @entity1 had a very novel idea about how the subject is taught			1
the 39 - year - old husband and father of three has been teaching @entity2 history for 13 years			1
he 's seen firsthand the demise of @entity2 history education , now our high school seniors ' worst subject			1
this school year , after watching his students ' intense interest in college basketball 's @entity20 tournament ( rather than school ) , @entity1 invented his own teaching curriculum , called @entity24 , to transform @entity2 history content into a similar competitive , student - driven tournament			1
" there is no reason that teaching @entity2 history in the 21st century can not be an amazing experience for all involved , " @entity1 told me			1
" kids need to make a personal connection with the people they are studying			0
kids who ' hate history ' are the ones who never were exposed to the human side of the people they are studying			2
" the goal of @entity24 is simple -- immerse students in the personalities and character of the great men and women of history through competition			1
for this school year , the tournament focused on one theme : the most courageous figure in @entity2 history			1
each student chose a historical figure he or she thought best embodies courage in @entity2 history , from military heroes such as @entity57 to civil rights leaders such as @entity59 and @entity60 to humanitarian pioneers such as @entity62			1
each choice was then paired off in the bracket system			0
students were required to research their character 's accomplishments and then defend their choice in front of the class			1
afterward , the class voted and the winners moved on to the next round , eventually narrowing the field of 64 to one champion			0
the genius of @entity1 's plan is that his students are required to use new arguments for each round			1
like a good coach draws up a new game plan for each opponent , so too must students innovate and dive deeper into their research			2
it was n't long before their competitive juices kicked in			0
in the first round of the brackets , @entity87 , one of the heroes of flight 93 on september 11th , lost by the slimmest of votes to @entity94 and @entity96 recipient @entity95			0
the girl who represented @entity87 was in tears over the outcome			0
" this is a student who had become deeply connected to the person she was researching and was overcome with emotion			2
to see this type of passion from a 16 - year - old girl in a public high school classroom is rewarding beyond words , " @entity1 said			1
over the school year , the brackets whittled down to two final characters , the aforementioned @entity95 and @entity114 hero and @entity96 recipient @entity115			0
before the final vote , @entity1 asked his class for any last arguments			1
a student with special needs raised his hand and spoke on @entity95 's behalf			0
he praised @entity95 for sacrificing his life to save his team in @entity125 , but he said what really makes @entity95 his choice was that when @entity95 was in 8th grade , he defended a special needs student who was being bullied			2
" for this young man a personal connection was made beyond what was in the headlines , " @entity1 recounted			2
" everyone in that room , including myself , learned something because that one nervous student with a shaky voice was emotionally invested in the material			0
" one special needs student discovered what millions of our students are missing -- a deep , personal connection to @entity2 history			1
in the course of human history , the @entity2 story is great and unique , one filled with men and women of courage , character , and compassion			1
we must bring it to life for other students like @entity1 did for his			1
his teach with @entity24 innovation may very well be one of the tools			0
already teachers across the country are using it , @entity1 says , and it 's replicable for any subject or any classroom			2
( i came to know @entity1 when he called into my radio show , morning in @entity2			1
he uses some of my books in his classroom			0
) teachers like @entity1 are a great influence on their students			1
education expert @entity174 estimates that the difference between a great teacher and bad teacher in a child 's lifetime earnings is hundreds of thousands of dollars			0
but more important than paychecks , a great teacher instills in his students character and a passion for self - instruction			2
in one of @entity1 's brackets , @entity114 hero @entity186 lost to @entity189 , the brave prisoner of war survivor and subject of the book " @entity192			2
" the young man representing @entity95 was heartbroken that he did n't win			0
@entity186 was more than just a war hero , this young man argued			0
at a young age , @entity95 's father left him and his family , leaving @entity95 to hunt for food and provide for his many siblings			0
at the same time , back at his home , this particular young man was watching his own father slowly succumb to cancer			0
he would soon be without a father and in a similar position as the young @entity186			0
like great teachers do , @entity1 was preparing this boy for more than a history exam			1
he was preparing him for life			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			2

a history teacher started using a " @entity20 " style tournament to involve students
@entity212 says @entity1 *injected* *excitement* into history
students were required to pick the person they think best embodies courage in @entity2 history
@entity212 : @entity226 prepares his students for more than a test ; he prepares them for life
