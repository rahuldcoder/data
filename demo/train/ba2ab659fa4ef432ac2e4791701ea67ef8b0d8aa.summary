@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 probably ca n't remember what french fries taste like ; she last ate them when she was 13			1
instead of candy bars , she downs whole grain energy bars			2
she eats almonds because she 's read that they help with balance			2
she 's an athlete who watches precisely what she eats but focuses on her training and her teammates			2
the 16 - year - old high school student knows that to win gold , everything has to be perfect , from her technique to her health to her coordination			1
the ultimate goal : leading her team to a world championship			1
she works out just about every day in the weeks leading up to the competition , and some practices last three hours			1
@entity3 , a rising cross-country star , is n't preparing for a race			1
she 's getting ready to compete with 19 other girls for a world championship in all - star cheerleading			1
more than 200,000 athletes take part in competitive cheerleading where high - flying stunts , powerful tumbling and tight synchronization yield winning scores in a growing network of competitions			1
the most prestigious event is the @entity40 of @entity41 , held annually in early may			1
" like i tell everyone , it 's like the @entity44 of cheerleading , " @entity3 told @entity2 just before her team competed in the event			1
" there 's just nothing that compares to the feeling of hitting a hard stunt or flipping through the air and then hearing the crowd roar when you hit it			2
if you experience it , it 's just like the happiest feeling ever because ... they 're hard skills and they 're exciting skills			2
" @entity3 cheers for @entity60 , which has six gyms in @entity1 ( and one in @entity63 ) and more than 900 athletes in the program			1
@entity3 trains at one of the team 's bigger facilities , in @entity0			2
the team 's website claims " 850 national championship titles and counting			0
" @entity60 's large senior team won world championships in 2010			1
@entity3 is on a smaller team , with 20 girls ( plus alternates )			1
she wants to bring another title trophy back to @entity0			0
her training is intense , probably the most fanatical on the team			0
" she is one of those kids that would be in the gym 23 hours of a 24 - hour day every day if she could			1
it means that much to her , " said @entity83 , @entity3 's coach			0
@entity3 writes down every workout because she said it makes her accountable and helps her train smarter			0
her log has notes on all of her practices and at - home sessions since last year 's world championships			1
" so i 've done 224 since , " she told @entity2 in april			0
winning over the judges in 150 seconds the routines in competitive cheerleading , known as all - star cheerleading , are 2Â½ minutes of music - pumping dance and quickly executed cheerleading stunts mixed with gymnastic moves			1
" it 's not traditional pompom			0
the sole purpose of your team is to compete against others			0
i really ca n't stand pompom			0
i like the athletic part of it and like the stunts and tumbling , and that 's what i 'm really into , " @entity3 said			0
@entity114 , an 18 - year - old member of the @entity60 world championship team , cheers for her high school team , too , but said there is a huge difference between the two teams			1
especially since at school , she cheers for other athletes to win , and with @entity60 , she 's part of the team			0
" it 's representing yourself and being part of something that 's just so special , " she said			0
and it 's special to a lot of girls			1
most of the girls on the top @entity60 teams have their parents drive them for two hours or more from other cities to the two main practice facilities			1
( the other is in central @entity1 in @entity138			1
) @entity60 co-owner and head coach @entity139 said many of the girls get home from school , pack a bag , jump in the car at 4 p.m. , get to practice at 6 , practice until 9 ( or 9:30 ) , then head home , getting into bed about midnight			1
homework is usually done in the car			0
one girl is from @entity153 but stays with a host family in @entity1			1
for many this is the pinnacle of their times as cheerleaders			0
some do go on to cheer in college , a few assisted by scholarship or stipend money			1
@entity163 , president of the @entity165 @entity164 -- the governing body of the sport -- said parents and kids should n't sink a lot of money into cheerleading hoping it leads to college grant money			1
the payoff comes from the friends you make and the way being a part of a team prepares you for being an adult , he said " people should participate in this because of the life skills you get from it , " he said by phone			0
" and if , oh by the way , you are able to get some help on a scholarship , then that 's a plus			0
" to compete at the elite level can take $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 a year -- on level with travel soccer teams , he said			0
it takes commitment @entity139 said the team practices every week of the year			1
it 's just the number of sessions and the intensity of them that varies			0
during the summer , the kids do miss time for vacation , but the gym is open most days of the year			2
@entity139 said they even practice while schools are closed for @entity207 break so the girls can maintain fitness and avoid getting hurt because they were a bit out of shape when they tried a move			1
and practices sometimes take up big chunks of the day -- especially for the coaches			0
@entity139 , who looks over 22 teams through the week , said on the primary practice days of saturday and sunday , she is at the gym for 10 to 11 hours			1
each team usually puts in two to three hours			2
all that time on the mat can make a mind and body weak			0
but @entity139 said that 's ok			0
" if you only come in and you hit when you 're perfect , then you do n't know how to fix things when they go wrong , " she said			2
" that 's the way that we 're able to , you know , maintain such a high level of , of accuracy in competition because we do n't just do it when we 're perfect , we do it when we 're going to make a mistake , and they have to get through it anyway			2
" the governing body does n't want athletes getting in over their heads so they issue guidelines to who can do what			0
coaches and athletes are certified , @entity163 said			0
that means coaches have to have someone attest to their training			0
there is a written component where the coaches demonstrate they have read the rules and safety guidelines , he said			0
" and there 's a hands - on portion where they actually have to show our testers the proper technique for spotting various cheerleading moves and stunts , " he said			1
braces and braces watch a video of the @entity60 team and you 'll notice several girls have braces -- on their teeth and on their ankles			2
but @entity139 said the sport is n't that risky			0
" we have had surprisingly few career - ending or long - term injuries , " she said			2
" we roll some ankles here and there or have some strained wrists or tendinitis and that kind of thing , but it is not superiorly dangerous by any stretch of the imagination			0
" published studies on reported injuries generally focus on high school and college cheerleading , where participants often practice on hard gym floors			1
while admitting more can be done to keep athletes safe , all - star cheerleading advocates say they use bouncy gymnastics floors , require safety rules be followed and use plenty of spotters			1
they point out that while the number of injuries has increased in the past decade , the number of participants has grown even more and the cheerleading season is longer than other sports			2
still year - round strain on a body and mind can lead to mishaps			2
both @entity3 and @entity114 had injury concerns going into the world championships			1
@entity114 lost sleep over a mild knee injury that threatened to keep her from competing			0
but she said that even if she were in a cast , she would still be in the lineup " because that 's how much i care about the team and the sport			0
" growth period @entity163 said the popularity of cheerleading is stabilizing in the @entity165 , but internationally the sport is seeing the kind of growth this country saw about 10 years ago			2
@entity139 said membership increases at @entity60 by double - digit percentages each year			2
many of the girls on the senior teams have been in the program for years			1
they have grown to be close friends , @entity139 said , and the challenges of cheerleading make them better people			2
" i truly believe that this experience and the life lessons and the teamwork ... and all the things that are gained from being with a group of people for 10 years like this and traveling together -- the same kids , is just immeasurably important down the road , " she said			0
and @entity114 said that despite the long days of practice , she feels like she 's not missing out on life			1
" i feel like i 'm experiencing an even more exciting teenaged time period because i get to do all these things that other people my age do n't get to do , " she said			0
" and even though it may seem like i 'm missing out on a lot of the typical activities that teenagers participate in , i get to do all of that and more because my team is like my group of friends that i get to hang out with every day			0
