-- when it comes to the @entity4 movement , the stereotypes do n't tell the whole story			1
here 's what you often see in the coverage of @entity4 rallies : offensive posters blasting president @entity12 and @entity14 leaders ; racist rhetoric spewed from what seems to be a largely white , male audience ; and angry protesters rallying around the @entity19			1
case in point : during the health care debate last month , opponents shouted racial slurs at civil rights icon @entity27 rep. @entity26 and one person spit on @entity30 rep. @entity29			0
the incidents made national headlines , and they provided @entity4 opponents with fodder to question the movement			1
but here 's what you do n't often see in the coverage of @entity4 rallies : patriotic signs professing a love for country ; mothers and fathers with their children ; african - americans proudly participating ; and senior citizens bopping to a hip - hop rapper			1
last week , i saw all of this during a five - city @entity52 swing as the @entity55 national tour made its way across the country			1
@entity0 was along for the ride , and i was charged with planning @entity0 's coverage for five stops in two states : @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 , @entity65 ; and @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity68			1
this latest @entity4 caravan kicked off on march 27 in senate majority leader @entity71 's hometown of @entity72 , @entity73			1
it is scheduled to make 45 stops before rolling into @entity76 on april 15 , not so coincidentally on " @entity77			2
" @entity0 was the only national news outlet on this @entity52 leg of the tour			2
we had a full team on the ground : myself , correspondent @entity81 , producers @entity82 and @entity84 and the crew of the @entity87 bus			0
for @entity84 , it was his third @entity55 tour			2
together , we beamed out images of the anger and the optimism , profiled african - americans who are proud to be in the @entity4 's minority and showed activists stirred by " @entity99 " or amused by a young rapper who strung together rhymes against the president and @entity14			1
the @entity87 traveled with the @entity55 buses for hundreds of miles , from rally to rally to rally			1
being at a @entity4 rally is not quite like seeing it on tv , in newspapers or online			1
that 's the reason @entity0 is covering this political movement -- and doing so in ways few others can or choose to do			1
it is important to show the colorful anger @entity96 might have against elected leaders and @entity76			2
but people should also see the orange - vested @entity4 hospitality handlers who welcome you with colorful smiles			2
there were a few signs that could be seen as offensive to african - americans			0
but by and large , no one i spoke with or i heard from on stage said anything that was approaching racist			0
almost everyone i met was welcoming to this @entity132 - @entity96 television news producer			0
and though speakers railed against the " lame - stream media , " activists and their leaders praised @entity0 , especially for being the only national media outlet riding along for the post-weekend stops			1
some of them e-mailed me after my trip , thanking our crew for fairly giving them a voice			0
speaking of stereotypes , i did get a few curious stares as i pulled up to the rallies			2
but not because of my skin color			0
it was because of my car rental : a @entity151			0
i had n't intended to rent a @entity151 , a car stereotyped as the favorite of liberal elites			0
but upon arriving at the @entity157 airport , the rental company was out of @entity96 - made cars with a gps system and satellite radio			0
i had nearly a thousand miles of driving ahead , through desert , mountains and cities			0
since it had gps and satellite radio , the @entity151 fit the bill			0
outside of the occasional stare , none of the real cowboys at the rallies came up to the @entity151 and asked me , " hey buddy -- where 's your cashmere sweater and arugula ? " if they had , i might have pointed out that until just recently , @entity151 was owned by @entity176 , an @entity96 icon			0
jokes aside , stereotypes can loom large when they 're magnified through a television lens , on the radio , the pages of a newspaper or in the vastness of the @entity181			0
so , it 's important that with a newsworthy , growing phenomenon like the @entity4 movement , viewers and readers fully understand what they see and what they do n't .			1

@entity0 's @entity195 planned coverage of @entity55 for five stops in two weeks
the stereotypes do n't tell the whole story , he says
being at a @entity4 rally is not quite like seeing it on tv , he says
@entity195 witnessed not just anger , but also optimism
