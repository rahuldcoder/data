-- on the outside , kidnapping survivor @entity1 seems to be , in the words of a friend , " doing great			1
" she seems her usual bubbly self , friends say , the @entity1 who puts others before herself			1
but there are hints , they say , of the trauma the 16 - year - old @entity12 girl suffered when , according to authorities , family friend @entity1 killed her mother and 8 - year - old brother and kidnapped her			1
" she 's , like , acting strong for everyone and i think that 's more of just , like , for her appearance , friend @entity19 said on @entity21 " on friday			1
" but i can tell that there 's something inside of her that 's upset , " @entity19 said			2
" like when we 're all , like , having a good time and once everyone stops laughing she gets kind of this serious look on her face			0
" @entity1 endured what would seem for most people an unspeakable horror -- being kidnapped by a family friend who killed her mother and brother , and then spirited her away to the woods			1
a chance encounter with horseback riders who reported the pair to authorities led to her rescue after a brief gunfight between @entity1 and @entity1 's rescuers			1
@entity1 letters found at kidnap suspect 's home while she has not spoken publicly since her release , she has seemed unusually outspoken on social media , where she has shared details of her ordeal and her feelings in response to questions from friends and strangers alike			1
her postings on the social media site ask.fm -- since taken down -- have generated some controversy among some who question why she seemed so upbeat despite all that she had been through			2
they note she answered questions about what would in any other context be typical teen fodder -- boys , nails , hair and music -- among revelations about her capture and whether she is happy that @entity1 is dead			1
" absolutely , " she posted			0
opinion : are we sharing too much online ? but @entity73 , a psychotherapist and co-author of " @entity75 , " said the posts actually could be a sign she 's coping well with the trauma -- so far at least			1
" i actually think it 's healthy and a sign of ego strength that here 's a 16 - year - old girl and she wants to do what normal 16 - year - olds do , " @entity80 said on " @entity21			1
" " and i think it 's really smart of her to talk , to try to put what happened to her in perspective and the way 16 - year - olds do			2
that is , they turn to social media , " she said			0
" she wants a support system			0
she 's getting that when she 's talking and interacting with people , so that 's healthy			2
" @entity1 addressed the issue herself on the ask.fm site			2
" i 'm trying to stay strong			2
and get out the truth , " she wrote			0
" you do n't know i could be crying answering these questions at the moment			0
" it 's in @entity1 's personality to try to be strong for everyone else , said friend @entity108			1
" she 's really like an outstanding person , " @entity108 said on " @entity21			2
" " like , she 's always like putting others before her			0
" but , @entity80 said , @entity1 is almost certainly in " denial and shock			2
" " what has happened to her probably does n't even feel real yet , " @entity80 said			0
affidavits : mother , brother ' tortured and killed ' and that she would seem to look good from the outside , even able to talk about mundane teen interests despite losing two family members and enduring a harrowing ordeal at the hands of someone who had been a family friend should n't be altogether surprising			0
" this is not the most difficult time for someone who is grieving because you have a lot of support of people around you , a lot of attention , " she said			0
darker times are almost certainly ahead for the girl , @entity80 suggested			0
" the difficulty comes when everybody forgets and you 're left in your life , one year , two years , three years down the road , and the people and the crowds are not there			0
" that 's in part why @entity1 's rural community came together thursday to host a fundraiser for her			1
the money raised will go toward @entity1 's needs in the future			1
any extra will be donated to support exploited children , said her father , @entity150			0
he added his own take on how she 's doing : " @entity1 sends her love			1
she 's doing good day by day , and we 'll keep moving forward from here			0
" @entity0 's @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
