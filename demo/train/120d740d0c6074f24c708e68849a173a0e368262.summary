@entity1 , @entity0 -- as @entity4 battles a cholera epidemic that has already killed hundreds , one company thinks it may have found a potential solution to the world water crisis			1
a shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in @entity4			1
@entity13 , a small @entity14 firm , has applied its water technology to create the @entity16 , a novel electricity - powered machine that draws moisture from the air and purifies it into clean drinkable water			1
the compact @entity16 , which goes on sale in the spring , is designed for household use			0
more crucially for countries such as @entity4 and the @entity24 , @entity13 is also working on another device , the @entity26 , which could potentially supply an entire village in the developing world			1
the team at @entity13 shares an ambitious goal : to quench the world 's growing thirst for water			1
now the 10 - person company is taking on a challenge that global multinationals have struggled to meet			0
@entity37 , the ceo of the company , says it was at a @entity41 conference on water in @entity43 last summer that he realized just how revolutionary @entity13 's technology might be			1
" there we were on the same stage as @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 , and it was a complete shock to us when we heard the solutions they were offering			0
we realized we had something that could effect change , " @entity37 tells @entity2			0
the @entity16 draws in air through a filter and then cools it into water droplets			1
this water then passes through a special filter and is exposed to ultraviolet light , which rids it of bacteria			2
the product @entity13 is designing for the developing world is called the @entity26 and is constructed by taking several of the water - making cells of the consumer appliance and hooking them up in series on a wall			1
the @entity41 , which has declared 2005 - 2015 the @entity71 , expects 1.8 billion people to live in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025			2
it 's no wonder then that @entity13 is being closely watched by the tech world			1
the @entity16 is being displayed at the @entity77 in @entity43 , a temporary store the magazine opens every holiday season that showcases the future of technology			0
about one in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water , and shortages pose serious health problems for much of the developing world			1
lack of clean water , coupled with poor sanitation practices , can lead to outbreaks of water - borne diseases , such as cholera and dysentery , which in turn , can cause life - threatening forms of diarrhea			1
more than 500 people have died in @entity4			1
diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of death from infectious diseases , and the majority of those deaths are among children under the age of 5 , according to the @entity106 and @entity107			0
most of those deaths could be prevented if improvements to sanitation and drinking water were made			2
but can an invention like the @entity26 really help ease the world 's water shortage and help prevent health disasters like the outbreak in @entity4 from occurring in the future ? " there are some brilliant inventions out there , but they are expensive and difficult to get hold of , " says @entity119 , an emergency water and sanitation consultant with international aid organization @entity121			1
the @entity16 retails for about $ 1,300 , but @entity37 estimates that a pared down version -- without the bells and whistle -- for use in places like @entity131 would cost about $ 300			0
the biggest challenge of a product like the @entity26 , @entity37 says , is the power consumed by the water - making cells			2
to counter that , the product is designed to turn on in stages so it does n't overload fragile power grids			0
in comparison to solutions like desalination , which can cost billions of dollars to develop , that 's cheap			2
" for about $ 300 we can start saving lives			0
ours is a very scalable product , " @entity37 says			0
@entity151 , an engineering adviser at international charity @entity152 , said the solution @entity13 is devising would n't be appropriate for the charity 's projects			1
for one , the technology does n't work in very dry climates			0
the machine only functions at or above about 35 percent relative humidity levels			2
furthermore , it requires an energy source			0
" our technologies have to be within the capacity of the benefiting community -- both technically and financially , " @entity151 says			0
@entity152 uses a number of low - cost and sustainable solutions , such as rainwater harvesting and hand - dug wells , to help communities in more than 17 countries access water			2
but those solutions depend upon the availability of water in the area , and fresh water supplies worldwide are feeling the squeeze from population growth , pollution and climate change			1
@entity37 admits the company needs to focus on growing its business first , so it may be some time before the @entity13 's products make their way to the developing world			1
" we quickly came to realize that if we did n't first build a business to perfect the product and application , then we were n't going to be able to get to a point where we could have a significant humanitarian impact , " he says			0
but @entity37 and partner @entity195 are in various stages of discussions with several humanitarian groups in the field			0
@entity37 declined to name the organizations			0
it 's early , but the company 's core principle is " to do good as we do well , " he says			2
" that 's part of truly what drives us -- knowing that at some point we will be able to do some significant good			0

@entity13 has developed a machine that creates clean water out of air
growth of water use has been *outpacing* the rate of population increase
shortages of clean water pose health challenges in the developing world
@entity4 's water crisis has unleashed a *devastating* cholera epidemic
