@entity0 , @entity1 -- there was a smile , a quick wave hello , a brief chat			0

from left : former president @entity15 , @entity16 and president @entity8			2
@entity8 and former president @entity15 were attending the inauguration of @entity16 -- brother of @entity1 's prominent parliamentary speaker , @entity20 -- who was tapped by @entity1 's supreme leader to be the new judiciary chief			1
it was only the second time @entity8 and his political rival @entity15 , a reformist who has been a vocal critic of the hard - line regime in place , sat under the same roof since the disputed june 12 elections drew a rift among @entity1 's @entity31 leadership , @entity1 media reported			1
photos from the scene show @entity8 exchanging friendly waves with @entity15 and @entity16 , who was wedged between the rivals			0
the three appeared to be chatting amicably before @entity20 made his acceptance speech			0
just minutes later , @entity8 alluded to @entity15 , one of the richest men in @entity1 , in a searing address that called for the prosecution of " the power - holders and the wealthy , " state - run @entity38 reported			1
but the president , who showed up more than an hour late for the ceremony , hustled out of the ceremony when @entity15 , the head of the assembly of experts that is in charge of selecting the supreme leader , took the podium , according to the @entity51 ( @entity51 ) , which is aligned with @entity15			0
the bad blood between the two high - profile figures goes back to the 2005 presidential race , when @entity8 defeated @entity15			1

during his speech at @entity16 's inauguration monday , @entity15 warned against the consequences of " unjust " verdicts in the trials , saying poor treatment of the detainees will cause society to " descend into chaos , " @entity38 reported " in the case of delivering fair verdicts , society will have a sense of security , " @entity15 said , according to @entity38 , " and no one will feel helpless in asserting his violated rights			0
" the treatment of detainees at @entity1 's prisons has increasingly become a divisive issue within @entity1 's @entity31 leadership , as reformists continue to accuse the government of allowing abuse and torture in attempts to coerce false confessions			2
