-- some of the nation 's top experts tuesday were looking for clues into sudden , mass deaths of birds in two states over @entity7 's weekend			1
" this one is unusual because of the time period over which so many birds died , " said @entity8 , a field investigator with the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
the center , part of the @entity17 , is receiving samples from @entity19 , where as many as 5,000 red - winged blackbirds and starlings fell from the sky in a square - mile area in less than an hour on @entity24 , according to the @entity25			1
the center will also examine samples from @entity28 , where 500 red - winged blackbirds , starlings and grackles were found dead in @entity32			0
a preliminary report conducted monday by the @entity34 found that the birds in @entity36 , @entity19 , likely died from massive trauma			1
there had been reports of loud sounds in @entity36 before the reports of birds falling began to come in			1
it 's possible the sounds made the birds disoriented , and they went into sudden , chaotic flights , crashing into each other and into objects , @entity8 said			1
" you 're disturbed , you 're disoriented , you 're trying to figure out where you are			0
we have seen some stuff like this before when there 's heavy dense fog , and they 'll run into towers and power lines , " she said			2
other bird experts agree that that 's a likely explanation			1
still , the sudden deaths are quite unusual			1
" it 's kind of a freak event , " said @entity62 , director of bird conservation for the @entity64			2
" you just do n't see these kinds of mass deaths very frequently at all			1
" at this time of year , blackbirds are in huge roosts , particularly throughout the southeastern @entity73 , he said			0
they generally do n't fly at night			2
" in the course of a year , about half the birds that are around die -- even under the best circumstances			2
the life of a bird is brutish and short			0
but it just usually happens out of the sight of people , " said @entity62			0
it 's possible that the loud sound that triggered the incident was @entity24 fireworks , though officials said the investigation is ongoing			1
" if it had been any other day of the week , " @entity62 said , he might have suspected people to be behind the deaths			2
" there 's a lot of purposeful killings			2
... people really do n't like these big roosts			0
but i ca n't see anybody doing that on @entity24			1
" @entity101 , senior scientist with the @entity102 , said his " first suspicion is that they were frightened and went into a mass panic			2
" " i would call this event unusual , " he said , " but not unprecedented			1
" @entity107 , a spokesman for the @entity108 , said the birds showed evidence of trauma in the breast tissue , with blood clots in the body cavity and a lot of internal bleeding			2
all major organs were normal			0
@entity118 , an ornithologist for the commission , said such incidents can be caused by a lightning strike or high - altitude hail			0
a strong storm system moved through the state earlier in the day friday			0
the experts @entity0 spoke with saw nothing surprising in there being a similar report of bird deaths in @entity28			1
" it 's another one of those coincidences , " said @entity8 , adding , " i 'm really interested to see if there 's anything that could possibly be related			0
i asked about weather conditions there			0
there 's sometimes high - altitude hail			0
" but , she said , so far officials were not aware of " any strange weather patterns " in the area			0
@entity62 , with the @entity64 , said there may be more reports of dead birds found around the country			0
" as soon as one of these things hits the airwaves , people are just more sensitive to seeing dead birds around			0
" meanwhile , @entity19 officials are investigating the death of an estimated 100,000 fish in the state 's northwest , but suspect disease was to blame , a state spokesman said sunday .			1

thousands of birds died suddenly friday night in two separate *locations*
experts suspect something panicked the birds into chaotic flight and crashes
it 's possible @entity24 fireworks sparked one of the mass deaths
scientists call the scale of these deaths unusual , but not unprecedented
