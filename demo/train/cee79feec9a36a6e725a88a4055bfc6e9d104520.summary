-- for many , typing has long overtaken handwriting as their primary word and sentence creation method			2
so much so that some schools no longer teach cursive			0
but now , @entity7 is bringing some good old fashioned handwriting back to modern communication , adding new handwriting input tools to @entity11 and @entity12			1
those tools now allow you to write out what you want to say with a mousepad or cursor and @entity7 will do its best to create a typed version of your words			0
the input box will show the most likely matches for your word , so below your handwritten " cats " it might display this list of possible words : cats , rats , @entity28 , oats , and carts			0
click on the right one and keep on writing			0
the tool might have a harder time deciphering your fancy calligraphy or messy chicken scratches , but it seems to do a decent job with my sloppy cursive - ish writing			0
while @entity41 is an option , it 's more for complicated alphabets where drawing out a character is sometimes easier than typing it , like @entity46 or @entity47			1
" handwriting input makes the internet easier to use by people worldwide and is also part of a larger effort to break the barrier between languages , " said @entity7 's @entity48 in a blog post announcing the feature			1
@entity11 users can get the new tool in more than 50 languages , @entity12 users in more than 20			1
to test it out , go to your @entity11 or @entity12 settings and , under the languages setting in the @entity67 tab , click " show all language options			1
" select the box that says " enable input tools " and you 'll get a list of every type of keyboard @entity7 has to offer			2
the languages with a pencil icon beside them are the ones that support written words			0
once you 've added an input option , you can select it anytime from a drop down on top of the menu bar above the document or email you 're writing			1
@entity7 already has handwriting support for its mobile translation apps so you can scrawl a word on the screen and see it instantly in another language			2
this is particularly helpful if you 're not familiar with a local alphabet and want to know what something says .			0

@entity7 has added a tool that reads your handwriting and turns it into text
the new input option is available on @entity11 and @entity12
it 's aimed at languages where drawing a character might be easier than typing it on a keyboard
