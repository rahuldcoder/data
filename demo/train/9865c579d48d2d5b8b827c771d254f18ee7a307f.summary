-- pope @entity2 ' trip to @entity3 memorialized the atrocities of the last century			1
on the way home , the @entity2 became embroiled in controversy about a conflict raging in the current one			1
during a lengthy discussion , @entity2 remarked on the spread of cruelty and torture before being asked about violence against religious minorities in @entity16 , and whether he approved of the @entity18 bombing campaign aimed at stopping the @entity19 , or @entity20			1
with what seemed careful deliberation , @entity2 said : " in these cases where there is an unjust aggression , i can only say this : it is licit to stop the unjust aggressor			1
i underline the verb : stop			2
i do not say bomb , make war , i say stop by some means			2
with what means can they be stopped ? these have to be evaluated			0
to stop the unjust aggressor is licit			1
" this response -- and the reaction to it -- says much about the complexity of running an organization that is at once modern and ancient , religious and political , international and parochial			1
but what exactly did he mean ? was he , as a few excitable writers suggested , calling for a new crusade ? certainly , much of the media response quickly fixated on what seemed to be approval for a military campaign and how a @entity2 -- the leader of the @entity49 -- was seemingly sanctioning war against an @entity19 caliphate			1
actually , he was n't			2
@entity52 , as defined by most historians , generally involved taking religious vows to head east and assist in military expeditions against @entity19 powers in exchange for spiritual rewards ( redemption from sin )			0
historians have identified major campaigns as the @entity63 , etc. @entity52			0
in response to these conquests , the local @entity19 powers leveraged the idea of jihad to rally disparate @entity70 groups together			0
yet although the @entity52 featured not just plenty of violence but also peaceful cross-cultural exchange , they are n't an example @entity2 wants to invoke			1
in fact , he is n't saying that anyone should take vows and go off to fight			2
instead , @entity2 is making the point that taking action to stop evil is just			1
this idea of justified violence , even from @entity49 , chiefly emerged from the writing of @entity85 ( 354 - 430 )			0
as @entity87 , associate professor of medieval studies at @entity89 , writes : " @entity85 argued that war was never desirable but was sometimes necessary			0
we must protect those who suffer from unjust aggression			2
if that could be accomplished without war , so much the better , but force could be used by legitimate authorities as a last resort			0
the end goal , however , was always -- and simply -- lasting peace			0
" that 's the context for understanding the ancient part of @entity2 ' response			1
the modern context emerged in how he concluded his answer			2
" one nation alone can not judge how to stop an unjust aggressor , " @entity2 said			1
" after the @entity109 there was the idea of the @entity111			0
it is there that this should be discussed			0
is there an unjust aggressor ? it would seem there is			1
how do we stop him ? only that , nothing more			2
" such pursuit of multiple perspectives to ward off bias is also @entity126			0
in " on @entity138 , " @entity85 argued that reading the @entity127 required special training because though the book contains all the truths of the universe , humans ( flawed creatures that we are ) are far too likely to assume that whatever we think is good is also what @entity136 thinks is good			0
to counteract this , @entity85 prescribed a strict intellectual diet of the best liberal arts and science education the late @entity144 world could provide			0
multiple perspectives help us discern what is truly just from what might just be convenient			0
in a way , that 's what @entity2 is doing with his words , too			1
he 's concerned that any individual leader or nation is far too likely to assume that someone with whom they disagree is unjust , and thus the principles of stopping unjust action instead becomes a tool for warmongering			2
instead , he argues , we should try to find consensus before acting , collectively , to put an end to atrocity			0
" we must also have memory , " @entity2 said			1
" how many times under this excuse of stopping an unjust aggressor the powers ( that intervened ) have taken control of peoples , and have made a true war of conquest			1
" history teaches us all about the dangers of mission creep			0
and it also makes clear that when two sides engage in the rhetoric of religious war , things can deteriorate rapidly			0
@entity182 and @entity183 , for example , both routinely railed against the @entity184 as " crusaders , " an accusation that gained traction in the @entity19 world after president @entity189 called for " this crusade , this war on terrorism " after 9/11			2
@entity2 does n't want to make a similar mistake			1
indeed , while he named himself after a medieval saint who lived during the era of the @entity52 , that @entity196 did n't actually go to war			0
instead he went on mission , seeking ( at least as we remember it today ) dialogue and understanding			0
and that 's certainly been pope @entity2 ' path so far			1
but when there is great suffering in the world , as is being inflicted on religious and ethnic minorities in areas controlled by @entity20 , then @entity2 says one must act , while also drawing on both the ancient idea of justified war and the modern concept of international cooperation			1
the question , of course , is whether in a digital age -- when misinformation and misunderstanding spreads so fast -- pope @entity2 can somehow find true harmony between old and new			1
his ability to do so will determine the lessons his papacy ultimately hands down for posterity .			0

asked about bombing in @entity16 , pope @entity2 says it is " licit to stop the unjust aggressor "
@entity228 says those remarks are n't a call for a new crusade , as some have suggested
he adds that the @entity2 is trying to *balance* lessons of the ancient and modern
