standing on top of the no. 55 @entity1 in victory lane , his fists pumping and the confetti flying , @entity6 was n't just celebrating a victory			1
he was n't just celebrating breaking a long losing streak			0
@entity6 was celebrating something much sweeter			1
three years earlier he was n't sure he 'd ever race again			2
in fact , he was n't sure if he 'd ever be healthy again			0
if he 'd known what to look for , perhaps @entity6 would have noticed the warning signs			1
the normally energetic and very fit 26 - year - old was tired			2
he struggled to keep up with a friend on a bike ride			0
a couple of his fingers turned white from lack of circulation			2
and then on a trip to @entity22 , where he was actually supposed to visit the troops at @entity25 , he woke up several times in the middle of the night with shortness of breath			0
yes , perhaps if he 'd known what those symptoms were signs of he might have acted sooner			0
@entity6 had no idea what was causing all that			1
it was only after several nudges from his doctors back home and actually reaching the point where he was struggling to catch his breath that @entity6 finally went to the emergency room			1
" luckily i got there in time and then once i got in the emergency room it was trying to figure out what was wrong			2
at first they thought pneumonia , they gave me antibiotics			0
i was having a hard time getting through the ct scan			2
every time i would lay down , my lungs would shut off and i just could n't breathe , " @entity6 said			1
eventually they did figure it out			0
@entity6 had dvt or deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism — a clot in your deep veins			1
the clots were located in his left leg , lungs and also his fingers — causing his fingers to turn white			1
" the ones in the fingers were the big mystery			2
we could n't figure how those got there because the way your circulatory system works , it would have had to have gone through my heart to get to my hand and come to find out , i had a hole in my heart between my left and right atrium and that 's how they got to my hand			2
well , if a clot goes through that hole it has two places it can go , your left hand or your brain			0
typically it goes to your brain			0
so i got very lucky that i did n't have a stroke , " @entity6 said			1
in the prime of his career , having just completed his best season , @entity6 was supposed to be a championship contender in 2010			1
but instead , just months into the year , @entity6 underwent surgery to repair his heart and began blood thinners for treatment of the clots			1
he had an uphill battle to just get out of the woods and get healthy			0
but then his thoughts turned to his passion			0
could he return to racing ? could he continue to chase his dream of becoming a championship winner ? at first he was told he might never race again , which was a tough sentiment to swallow			2
but eventually there seemed to be a bit more discussion and possibility			0
" so as the doctor put it , would you rather take the risk of dying from another clot or just potentially an internal injury and bleeding to death , you know , being on blood thinners			2
they ca n't say for sure , but he 's like it 's 50/50 , so you just have to pick			0
and you know my decision was to be off of blood thinners for a lot of reasons , primarily to race , " said @entity6			1
he followed doctors instructions and did n't rush it			0
@entity6 sat out the remainder of the 2010 season as he rebuilt his strength , monitored by his doctors			1
but he did get back in the car and pushed all fears out the window			1
" i certainly thought about it — the possibility of having another clot -- but that was n't what i was thinking about when i was driving into turn one at 200 mph			0
" but even the massive hurdle of recovery was n't the only one in his path to return to the track			2
@entity6 raced for @entity150 and they had decided to leave the sport — leaving @entity152 jobless			1
eventually , @entity6 took a gamble and settled on a part - time ride with @entity156			1
he had other offers for full - time positions but felt this was the right choice for him			1
" i wanted to be back so bad but i do n't want to be back just for the sake of being in the sport			2
i wanted to be back to win			2
so i took a pass and took a chance and then this opportunity came up with @entity156 and with @entity166 , " @entity6 said coming into the next season he again chose to stay with @entity156			1
" there were some opportunities , again decent but not championship caliber teams , to go race full time			1
but i was so happy with the team that i was with and really felt at home there , with the partners and the team , you know , like @entity177 and @entity166 , the whole staff at @entity156 , the culture , and i did n't want to give that up			0
i 'd been around long enough to know how difficult that is to find and it was n't something i was going to give up lightly , even if it meant racing part time again another year			0
" his patience paid off			0
earlier this season @entity6 returned to victory lane and soon after that he accepted a full - time deal for two seasons with @entity156			1
he 's back on track — literally and figuratively			1
@entity6 has had a two - for - one in second chances			1
he recovered from this near - death medical issue and he 's now experiencing a steady professional comeback as well			1
but @entity6 knows it 's both luck and hard work that got him here and he also knows there are many others who face similar hardships			1
he hopes sharing his story helps shine a light on some of these issues for others or simply inspires anyone going through difficult times to " never give up			0
" this is the motto @entity6 now lives by			2
he has teamed up with a foundation one of his doctors helped create called @entity206			2
@entity6 supports it by donating his money , raising awareness for the foundation by putting its logo on his car and holding fundraisers for the group			1
" it was an organization i did n't even know of prior to having clots			0
you know , i did n't even think about blood clots at all			1
i 'd never even thought about it , and who gets blood clots and why ? i just never thought it would be something i would have to deal with			1
" @entity6 hopes to help change that and help @entity206 not only raise money for treatment and prevention but also to educate more people about how warning signs present themselves			1
he also views this chapter in his life as a learning experience			0
" i think anytime you go through a dramatic experience you 're gon na learn a lot : personally , professionally , all of the above			0
you 're gon na learn a lot about who you are and how you handle those situations and going through this experience was no exception for me			0
" " you also learn about who 's there for you and your family and what they taught you growing up and never give up is one of the biggest things my parents instilled in me			0
they supported me through the whole process			0
and not just pushing me to go back racing , you know , they were just there for me no matter what			0
they just said we do n't care if you ever go back , we do n't care what you do , we just want you to be ok and we love you , " @entity6 continued			1
@entity6 also noted that one of the harder lessons he learned was that not everyone will always be in your corner			2
but he feels this is " a blessing in disguise " that no matter the circumstance anyone could relate to			0
he explained : " it 's kind of clearing out the weeds , so to speak			0
because life 's too short to have people in your life that are n't truly engaged in your life and support you no matter what			0
so as difficult as it is going through that experience , once the dust settles you 're glad to have that gone , because now you can focus more energy on the people that really matter			0

@entity6 was *diagnosed* with blood clots in his leg , lungs and fingers
the clots kept him out of the race car for almost all the 2010 season
once recovered , @entity6 had to fight his way back onto the track full - time
@entity6 now works with @entity206 to help raise awareness and funds
