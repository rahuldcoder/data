-- this morning , i decided to wear jeans			0
i could 've gone with sweat pants , but i needed to stop by a couple of offices and did n't want to look too relaxed			1
i could 've done slacks but did n't want to look too uptight			1
i 'm not big into khakis , and it 's too chilly for shorts , so jeans won out			2
i decided to go with the @entity12 roast over the @entity13			0
when i got in my jeep , i decided to listen to @entity15 as opposed to @entity16 or @entity17			0
i opted not to run that red light			0
i chose to park on the street as opposed to the nearby lot			0
and just before i got out of the car , i chose to be gay			0
i was going to make that decision earlier , but you know how hectic mornings can be			0
i 'm just glad i remembered when i did			0
i 've been known to go all day without remembering to pick a sexual orientation , which can make things pretty awkward at home			1
now , if that last part sounds a bit stupid to you , welcome to my world			0
the idea that people can just pick their sexual orientation the way they pick what to wear or what kind of coffee to drink is so irrational that even conservative vice-presidential nominee @entity40 had a problem going along with that line of thinking			1
in 2007 , he voted to support the @entity43 , saying , " they ( his gay friends ) did n't roll out of bed one morning and choose to be gay			1
that 's who they are			2
" his words from back then echo the words of dr. @entity59 , the director of the @entity60 , who said this year , " since homosexuality is not a disorder or a disease , it does not require a cure			0
" it 's been more than 20 years since the @entity62 removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders			2
which is why the news out of @entity67 this week should not be that gov. @entity68 signed legislation that prohibits minors from being subjected to treatment from state - licensed therapists designed to change their sexual orientation			1
the story is that this practice is still going on in 2012			0
" this bill bans non-scientific ' therapies ' that have driven young people to depression and suicide , '' @entity68 said in a statement			0
" these practices have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery			0
" news : @entity67 governor signs gay conversion therapy ban and trying to change children from gay to straight is indeed quackery -- so say the people who study quackery for a living			1
" the longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation , " the @entity97 says , adding that the potential risks of so - called " reparative therapy " include depression , anxiety and self - destructive behavior			1
of course , there will always be people who refuse to let facts get in the way of their prejudice , and some of those folks are a bit upset by @entity68 's actions -- particularly members of the @entity120			2
news : therapist to challenge ' gay cure ' ban on its website , the group said it " is saddened but not surprised by this unprecedented legislative intrusion and will lend its full support to the legal efforts to overturn it			0
" keep in mind , the association 's website has featured " reparative therapy " studies conducted by @entity135 , a former board member who resigned after he paid a male escort to accompany him on a 10 - day @entity138 vacation and allegedly give him nude massages			1
( @entity135 denies any sexual behavior in the incident			2
) that 's not mentioned on the website			2
anyway , there is also a rigorous defense there of the infamous 2001 " reparative therapy " study conducted by dr. @entity149			1
back then , @entity149 suggested that highly motivated gay people could change their orientation			1
since then , @entity149 himself said he was wrong and went so far as to issue a statement that read in part : " i believe i owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy			1
i also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that i had proven that reparative therapy works with some ' highly motivated ' individuals			1
" the doctor who conducted the study denounces the findings			0
and yet quackery is still trying to hold on to the notion that just as people can choose @entity175 over @entity13 , they can choose to be straight over gay			2
in a recent @entity0 interview , conservative televangelist @entity177 -- who says that being gay is a sin -- also said , " i know i have not chosen to be straight			2
it just feels like that 's who i am			0
" but when he was asked how , then , could a gay person choose to be gay , if he did n't choose to be straight , well -- " i do n't understand all of those issues , and so , you know , i try to stick on the issues that i do understand			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			1

@entity196 : *experts* *widely* agree it 's irrational to think one can choose sexual orientation
@entity67 governor signed *law* barring " sexual *re-orientation* " treatment for minors
so - called " reparative therapy " has been renounced by *author* who suggested it
@entity211 : conservative pastor says he did n't choose own orientation but ca n't *explain* gays
