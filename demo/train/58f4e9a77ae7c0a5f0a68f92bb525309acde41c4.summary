-- every day , refugees and migrants risk their lives as they seek a new life			0
now , a new report from the @entity6 has put a figure to the number of victims : at least 40,000 deaths since 2000			1
more than half of those who died -- some 22,000 -- were trying to get to @entity13 , the @entity6 said			1
nearly 6,000 more migrant deaths occurred along the @entity17 - @entity16 border and another 3,000 deaths from migration routes including @entity21 's @entity20 and the waters of the @entity23 , according to the group 's research			1
" our message is blunt : migrants are dying who need not , " said @entity6 director general @entity26			2
" it is time to do more than count the number of victims			0
it is time to engage the world to stop this violence against desperate migrants			2
" the @entity6 report , published monday and titled " @entity38 -- tracking lives lost during @entity43 , " puts the number of those killed trying to reach @entity13 at nearly 4,000 since the start of 2013			1
more than three - quarters of those victims died in the first nine months of this year , many of them drowning after being trafficked in unseaworthy vessels from the shores of the @entity50 and @entity21 across the @entity51			1
two shipwrecks off the tiny @entity54 island of @entity55 last october , in which more than 400 migrants died , made headlines around the world and prompted calls for action			1
@entity54 's navy launched @entity62 to try to find and rescue stranded migrants			0
nonetheless , there have been many more shipwrecks and many more deaths in the year since			0
just this month , witnesses told the @entity6 that as many as 500 people had died , including women and children , when human traffickers intentionally sunk their boat in the @entity51 off @entity73			1
only 11 survivors have been found			0
some of those on board were fleeing conflict in @entity78 or @entity79 ; others were looking for the chance to escape persecution or poverty and build a better life			0
@entity85 and @entity78 made up the largest number of those arriving in @entity54 so far this year , the @entity6 said			2
@entity54 navy finds dozens of bodies in migrant boat @entity90 : ' survival test ' rights group @entity90 released a new report tuesday , accusing the @entity93 and its member states of " imposing a survival test on refugees and migrants			1
" its research puts the number of those killed in the @entity51 so far this year at at least 2,500 people			1
" in the absence of safe and regular routes into @entity13 , accepting the risk of drowning in the central @entity51 is the price many refugees and migrants must pay to access asylum or job opportunities , " it said			1
the group calls for @entity13 to do more , pointing out that while @entity54 has shouldered the burden of migrant rescues in the @entity51 over the past yea , it is unwilling to do so indefinitely			1
this is partly because it then takes responsibility for those rescued , who often want to reach other @entity13 nations			2
if @entity54 does scale down its operation without a new system in place or a better response by the @entity93 border agency , @entity129 , many more lives will be lost at sea , the human rights group cautions			0
@entity90 also warns that with the current unrest in the @entity50 and long - running conflicts elsewhere , the number of people trying to reach @entity13 is unlikely to fall			1
tens of thousands of people are trapped in increasingly lawless @entity138 , a major transit nation , and are seeking a way out , the report said			0
with the sealing off of land routes via @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , many see no option but to embark on the dangerous journey by sea			0
" in 2013 , 48 % of all irregular entrants and 63 % of all those arriving irregularly by sea to the @entity93 came from @entity78 , @entity85 , @entity152 and @entity153 , countries torn by conflict and widespread human rights abuses , " the report said			0
' @entity159 ' traffickers ram boat full of migrants and kill 500 , survivors say ' @entity163 response ' to migrants the @entity6 warns that the true number of migrants killed is likely to be " considerably higher " than the number documented for its report			2
" although vast sums of money are spent collecting migration and border control data , very few agencies collect and publish data on migrant deaths , " said @entity6 research chief @entity169			2
many migrants disappear and die without a trace as they make perilous journeys across deserts or seas			0
" the paradox is that at a time when one in seven people around the world are migrants in one form or another , we are seeing an extraordinarily harsh response to migration in the developed world , " said @entity26			0
" limited opportunities for safe and regular migration drive would - be migrants into the hands of smugglers , feeding an unscrupulous trade that threatens the lives of desperate people			1
we need to put an end to this cycle			0
" undocumented migrants are not criminals			0
they are human beings in need of protection and assistance , and deserving respect			0
" by highlighting the awful toll of migration , the @entity6 hopes to discourage would - be migrants from falling into the hands of unscrupulous criminal gangs and traffickers , as well as pressuring developed nations to change their policies to create more safe avenues of legal migration			1
@entity17 - @entity16 border an estimated 230 migrants died between january and september of this year trying to cross the @entity17 - @entity16 border , the report said			1
because information from the region is so patchy , the figures do n't include the likely several hundred people who die in @entity224 each year as they make their way north to the border			2
between fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 2013 , a total of 6,029 migrants were found dead on the @entity17 side of the border , the report said			1
about 100 lives a year have been lost on average in the seas bordering @entity233 , although the number has dropped off significantly this year , the @entity6 said			2
most of those who travel by boat depart from @entity237 , with the vast majority in recent years coming from @entity152 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241			0
@entity0 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
