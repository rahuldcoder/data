-- maybe you 've seen the video by now -- the @entity4 clip where a man drives through a neighborhood in @entity7 and films a lawn that seems to be burping oil			1
if not , you should check it out			0
beware , though : i 've had a hard time getting the 33 - second snippet out of my head			1
it 's not necessarily the scene , although that 's part of it			1
for me , it 's the smell			2
about halfway through the clip the videographer says , " the smell is unbelievable			0
" that 's not the liveliest description , to be sure			2
but those words were all it took to transport me back to a boat on the @entity29 in 2010 -- bobbing on what seemed to be an endless sea of oil after the @entity34 spill			1
the air 's acidic tang stuck in my nose and on my tongue			2
i remember taking a drink of water later that day , firmly back on the shore			0
it still tasted like gas			0
the @entity44 , @entity7 , spill is nothing compared to the @entity29 disaster , of course			1
fourteen ducks , two turtles and one muskrat were oiled as a result of the friday spill , according to @entity54			2
about two - dozen homes were evacuated			0
the full toll of the @entity58 ( the news media started calling it that because " spill " was n't big enough to be accurate ) is still being tabulated , but the numbers are of another magnitude : 210 million gallons of oil , as well as 464 oiled sea turtles and 8,567 affected birds , many of them dead , according to an april 2012 report compiled by two federal agencies and five states			2
both incidents , however , are pieces in a bigger puzzle			2
they highlight , once again , that @entity74 is addicted to fossil fuels and needs to invest more seriously and urgently in alternatives like wind , solar and nuclear			0
these events never seem to really stick in our collective memory			0
if they did , they would inform our decision - making			0
the way things work now , oil spills are seen by some politicians as expected -- as externalities of our condition , like lung cancer to a smoker			1
@entity74 rep. @entity94 , an @entity7 @entity95 , reportedly told a local radio station on wednesday that we have oil pipeline accidents " just like we have car accidents " and that he supports further development of the system that caused the spill in his state			1
how silly , right ? we should n't expect oil spills to be part of modern reality			1
there are much better ways forward			0
environmental groups are right to use the @entity7 spill as a cautionary tale -- as one of many reasons that the @entity115 administration should reject a proposed pipeline , called the @entity117 , which would carry this risky type of crude from @entity120 to the @entity121 of the @entity74 for processing			1
the connection is n't immediately clear , but the @entity125 pipeline that leaked in @entity7 was carrying the same type of " oil sands " crude that the @entity117 pipeline would			1
( @entity131 detour here , but who in their right mind names a dirty , underground pipeline after @entity125 , the mythical , flying horse ? hat tip to @entity139 's @entity138 for noticing that that name is probably the most orwellian thing you 'll come across all week			1
) this is oil that 's mined in northern @entity145 , @entity120 , with the help of some of the world 's biggest trucks			1
the crude is squeezed out of huge chunks of strip - mined dirt , as opposed to drilled from pools of oil underground			1
the groups contend this thicker " oil sands " material is more corrosive to pipelines and therefore more dangerous to transport across the @entity74			2
the @entity160 , in a recent blog post , says oil sands crude also is transported at higher temperatures , putting additional stress on pipelines ; and it 's thicker and harder to clean up than conventional crude			1
business groups say the material is not more corrosive , citing a report commissioned by the @entity168			0
those debates , however , obscure the more obvious point : we should be turning our attention -- and should have turned it long ago -- away from oil and toward greener options			2
regardless of how they are transported , fossil fuels contribute to climate change when they 're burned			0
and we ca n't afford to keep relying on them so heavily			0
but there seems to be little change of course under way			0
we 're using newer , riskier technologies to extract the last of the @entity185 's hardest - to - get fossil fuels			2
that 's true of old pipelines carrying new , more environmentally questionable types of crude from @entity120 to the @entity74 @entity121			1
it 's true of natural gas " fracking , " where liquid is injected into the ground to dislodge gas from cracks in the rock			0
the practice has raised concerns about possible links to earthquakes and potential groundwater contamination			0
and it 's true of drilling in the deep ocean , which , as the 2010 disaster in the @entity29 showed , we obviously have n't figured out quite yet			1
to create an era of sustainable , clean energy , we need to pay more attention to spills like the one in @entity7 and the one in the @entity29			1
these events should stick in our noses and on our tongues			0
it took a @entity4 video to remind me of that			0
i hope it grabs your attention , too			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity224 .			1

an @entity7 oil pipeline on friday *spewed* crude into a neighborhood
@entity230 : spills like this should cause us to take stock of energy policy
he says we are too quick to forget incidents like this and the @entity34 disaster
@entity224 : it 's time to *accelerate* our move to alternative *sources* of energy
