-- the @entity1 towers above the @entity2 in @entity1 , directly between the @entity3 to the east and the @entity5 to the west			0
but @entity7 seems to think it lies several hundred yards to the south , near the @entity9			2
the mistake appears to be one of many in @entity7 's new mobile maps , which replaced @entity14 as the default map application in @entity16 , the new operating system for @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
@entity7 has faced a chorus of complaints since @entity16 was made available for download wednesday , and the griping will likely grow louder as people get their hands friday on new iphone 5s			1
5 big changes in @entity16 " what @entity7 has done with # ios6 maps is like planning a mission to outer space and not talking to @entity34 , " tweeted tech - loving comedian @entity28 , a former digital director for the @entity29			1
@entity7 announced earlier this year it was replacing its mobile map software from @entity14 with a new @entity7 - designed system			1
all @entity38 and @entity18 users are now forced to use the new map system when they update their software or buy the @entity38 , which will come pre-loaded with the maps			1
but within minutes of the new software launch on wednesday , @entity38 users began to point out that a number of landmarks had been misplaced on @entity7 maps , incorrectly named and lost entirely			1
screenshots posted online appear to show a museum located underneath a river , while the map service seems to deny the existence of the @entity53 town @entity54 , where @entity55 was born			0
other users say a search for @entity59 directed them to @entity59 , @entity60 , in @entity61 , instead of the @entity63 capital			0
many customers say they are upset that @entity7 has removed mentions of public transportation routes or stations from its new map service , a popular feature on the @entity14 system which allowed users to see bus and train schedules at individual stations			1
@entity75 's minister for justice expressed concern that the new @entity7 maps identify a working farm in a residential area of suburban @entity80 as an airport , a potential hazard for pilots			1
the @entity7 's maps have already inspired a @entity86 feed , the ironically named " the @entity90 6 maps , " filled with examples of mangled mapping			1
and some @entity92 users pointed out the irony in that the new map system was unable to pinpoint an @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97 , which it placed on the wrong side of the road			2
tech blogger and entrepreneur @entity100 was especially critical of the new maps , which he called " pretty but dumb , " and of @entity7 for releasing what he said was a flawed product			2
" @entity7 made this maps change despite its shortcomings because they put their own priorities for corporate strategy ahead of user experience , " he wrote			2
" that 's a huge change for @entity7 in the @entity113 era , where they 've built so much of their value by doing the hard work as a company so that things could be easy for users			2
" iphone 5 : the wait is over @entity7 is preaching patience			0
@entity7 spokesperson @entity124 told @entity0 , " customers around the world are upgrading to @entity16 with over 200 new features including @entity128 , our first map service			1
we are excited to offer this service with innovative new features like @entity133 and @entity135 integration , and free turn by turn navigation			0
we launched this new map service knowing that it is a major initiative and we are just getting started with it			0
we are continuously improving it , and as @entity14 is a cloud - based solution , the more people use it , the better it will get			0
we 're also working with developers to integrate some of the amazing transit apps in the @entity147 into @entity148			0
we appreciate all of the customer feedback and are working hard to make the customer experience even better			0
" some tech bloggers on thursday were advising owners of older iphones not to upgrade to @entity16 because of the maps			2
meanwhile , @entity157 satellite navigation company @entity156 , which provided the data for the new map system , told @entity0 it is not responsible for the way the maps work			0
the poor reception for @entity7 's maps do n't appear to have dented the popularity of the @entity38 , however			1
@entity7 announced on monday that pre-orders of the phone topped 2 million in just 24 hours and that its initial supply batch for the phone sold out in just an hour			0
