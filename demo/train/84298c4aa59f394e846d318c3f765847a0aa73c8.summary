-- @entity3 fighter jets and soldiers on tuesday waged an offensive against a group of armed invaders from the @entity8 , who have staked a claim to a remote part of the island of @entity13 , authorities said			1
previous efforts by @entity3 police to turn the men back had ended in deadly clashes			0
the group of @entity8 men , believed to number between 100 and 300 , arrived three weeks ago on the east coast of the @entity3 state of @entity23 , on @entity13 , demanding to be recognized as representatives of a sultanate that used to rule the area			1
@entity3 authorities initially tried to persuade the men to return peacefully to their homes in the nearby southern @entity8			1
but the intruders refused to budge , and the standoff turned violent in recent days as clashes in the region reportedly left nine @entity3 police officers and 19 intruders dead			0
" our security forces were attacked and killed			0
@entity3 , particularly those in @entity23 , are worried about their safety , " @entity3 prime minister @entity37 said in a statement carried by the national news agency @entity39 announcing the offensive tuesday			1
the standoff has touched on an unresolved territorial issue between the @entity8 and @entity3 , as well as @entity45 's efforts to improve relations with @entity48 insurgents in the country 's south after decades of violence			1
the @entity3 operation tuesday morning in @entity53 , the district in @entity23 where the @entity8 men had come ashore , involved an air raid by @entity55 and @entity57 fighter jets followed by mortar fire and a ground assault by soldiers , @entity39 reported			1
the security forces " achieved their objective , " the news agency cited @entity62 , the head of the @entity3 @entity63 , as saying without elaborating on what exactly the goal had been			1
no members of the @entity3 forces were hurt in the attack , and the casualties on the @entity8 side had yet to be determined , he said			1
but representatives of the @entity8 group did n't report any initial losses from the offensive , saying the @entity3 jets had dropped bombs at a location they had occupied previously			1
@entity8 group on @entity13 claims to represent sultanate , @entity3 says ' the @entity82 ' the @entity8 men have called themselves the @entity82 of the sultanate of @entity84 , a former @entity48 power in the region that once controlled parts of the @entity8 and @entity13			1
its influence has since faded , and it is now a clan in the poor , restive southern @entity8			0
the sultanate 's leadership has been riven by internal power struggles in recent decades , but the squabbling family members appear to have united in the decision to send their followers to @entity23 , a move that has alarmed @entity3 and complicated efforts by the @entity8 to pursue peace talks with @entity102 rebels in its southern islands			1
@entity105 , a spokesman for one of the sultanate 's leaders in @entity45 , said the armed the @entity8 men reported hearing shots being fired nearby , but had so far suffered no casualties			1
@entity105 blamed @entity3 authorities for the escalation of the standoff , saying they had fired the first shots in the clash that took place between the two sides on friday			0
he added that a woman and family members of @entity23 residents had been killed in that skirmish			0
he also claimed that other people in the region were joining the sultanate 's followers in the fight against the @entity3 forces but was unable to provide details			2
" we do n't know who they are , but they are there , " he said			0
since the crisis began , @entity8 authorities have urged the sultanate 's followers to lay down their arms and return home			2
" from the very start , our objective has been to avoid the loss of lives and the shedding of blood , " president @entity140 said at the weekend			0
" if you have grievances , the path you chose was wrong			0
the just , and indeed , the only correct thing for you to do is to surrender			0
" excluded from a peace deal the @entity23 standoff has its roots in a recent landmark peace deal between @entity45 and @entity102 rebels , according to @entity156 , the dean of the @entity157 at the @entity158			0
the members of the sultanate 's royal family seem to have felt isolated by the provisional accord signed in october by the @entity8 government and the @entity164 , which has fought for decades to establish an independent @entity48 state in southern @entity8 , @entity156 said last month			2
the sultanate has succeeded in grabbing the attention of @entity8 and @entity3 authorities			1
but the resulting violence makes the outcome of the situation unclear			0
established in the 15th century , the @entity84 of @entity84 became an @entity48 power center in @entity173 that at one point ruled @entity23			0
but the encroachment of @entity177 colonial powers , followed by the emergence of the @entity8 and @entity3 as independent nation states , steadily eroded the sultanate 's power , according to @entity156			1
it became " a sultanate without a kingdom " to rule over , he said			0
@entity185 is now a province within the @entity8			0
the economic , cultural and historical links between @entity23 and the nearby @entity8 islands , as well as the porous nature of the border between the two , means that many of the sultanate 's followers have friends and relatives in @entity53			2
and the historical connection still fuels tensions between @entity3 and the @entity8 , with @entity45 retaining a " dormant claim " to @entity23 through the @entity84 , according to the @entity200			1
the @entity8 claims much of the eastern part of @entity23 , which was leased to the @entity203 in 1878 by the sultanate of @entity84			2
in 1963 , @entity205 transferred @entity23 to @entity3 , a move that the sultanate claimed was a breach of the 1878 deal			2
@entity3 still pays a token rent to the sultanate for the lease of @entity23			2
