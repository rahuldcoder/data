" yet the meager resources and the diminished coping abilities of the government and humanitarian actors means that they are faced with limited options			0
" because @entity60 has closed its borders , people in the north are increasingly heading to the desert , where they will face harsh conditions and real struggles over food and water with limited humanitarian assistance , the group said			1
many are fleeing on foot because they ca n't afford boats or buses , @entity103 said , and even if they do make it , they get there only to find the roads blocked			0
