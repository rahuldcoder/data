-- @entity1 is redefining " family " for @entity3 children affected by @entity4 , @entity5 and poverty			1
since 2006 , her organization , @entity8 , has used the @entity9 to connect almost 500 teens with nearly 300 volunteer mentors from all over the world			2
@entity1 started the program after witnessing how @entity4 and @entity5 left many children without parents			1
@entity0 asked @entity1 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity18 of 2011			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a top 10 @entity18 ? @entity22 : i was attending the @entity24 in @entity25 , and i received the amazing news while i was standing in a stairwell at the 92nd @entity28 i am personally gratified and honored to be selected as a top 10 @entity18 , and thrilled for our entire team			1
mostly though , i am very thankful because being selected will benefit the larger cause : affecting the lives of adolescents across @entity34			0
we are very proud of the impact we 've had			0
being in the top 10 both recognizes this and encourages the entire effort			1
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity41 ? @entity1 : since conceiving of @entity8 , we have been developing , refining and proving that our model works			1
volunteer video mentors around the world connect with hundreds of @entity3 teens every week			1
expanding those numbers to reach tens of thousands of teens across @entity34 is our next goal			0
we are certain that ( this ) will help propel us to the growth we envision			0
... most people look at these big problems and think , " it 's so big , i ca n't do it , i ca n't get involved			2
" having had the ability to have people say , " oh , gosh , you do n't have to be a millionaire to try something new , " is really powerful			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity18 ? @entity1 : we plan to use it to start two new computer labs and , at our existing four labs , connect children who are still waiting to have video mentors of their own			1
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : we all learn best from each other , which is why growing up in families and communities of caring adults is so important			1
more than 50 million children in @entity34 do not have this opportunity			0
... we 're figuring out how many millions we can serve			0
i ca n't adopt all of those children , so i have to bring someone else into their lives in some way			2
... @entity8 mentees are highly resilient and hopeful young people			0
they see and speak every week with their adult mentors face - to - face via the @entity9 -- an adult who is there for them and imparts life lessons and discusses , challenges , teaches , encourages , befriends and loves them			0
we play a critical role in helping our youth learn and develop and one day to become contributing members of their schools , communities and countries			0
