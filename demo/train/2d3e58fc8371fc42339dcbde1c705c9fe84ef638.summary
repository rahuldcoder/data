-- @entity2 champion @entity1 bowed meekly out of @entity3 friday to extend her miserable record at the grass court grand slam , blaming her lack of preparation for a shock defeat			1
the @entity11 second seed was beaten 7 - 6 7 - 6 by @entity12 of the @entity13 , ranked 43 in the world , who was reaching the last 16 of a grand slam for the first time in 32 attempts			1
trailing 6 - 5 in the second set tiebreaker , @entity1 successfully challenged after her forehand was called long			1
but given a second chance of redemption on a replayed match point , @entity1 served her seventh double fault to exit in lame fashion			1
the 32 - year - old @entity1 has never gone beyond the last 32 in eight appearances at the @entity27 and also went out in the first round of the @entity29 last month			1
it 's a far cry from her triumph in @entity32 back in january when she beat @entity33 in the final of the opening grand slam of season , her second triumph in one of tennis ' four majors			2
after her defeat , @entity1 told reporters that she had made an error of judgment in skipping the warmup event at @entity46			1
" i think i needed some matches before the big one , i think i made the wrong decision , " she said			0
for the 28 - year - old @entity12 , it was her biggest win of a mediocre career on the @entity53 , interrupted by a six - month ban for a doping offense in 2013			2
" i am very happy			0
i played a great match and i believed i could do it			0
it 's my biggest win , " she said			2
former world number one @entity60 awaits the @entity13 in the next round , the @entity59 beating @entity63 teenager @entity62 6 - 3 6 - 0 to reach the last 16 of a grand slam for only the third time since 2011			2
@entity66 later won the battle of former champions on @entity69 after an enthralling two and a half hour battle against @entity71			0
@entity66 , who took the title in 2011 , had to come back from a set down to beat the five - time champion from the @entity75 , 5 - 7 7 - 6 7 - 5			2
@entity78 fourth seed @entity76 , the runner - up to @entity71 ' younger sister @entity80 in 2012 , also made the last 16 with a 6 - 2 6 - 0 win over @entity84 qualifier @entity82			2
@entity86 scare in the men 's tournament , top seed @entity86 took a nasty tumble on the way to a 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 4 win over @entity93 's @entity92			1
the 2011 champion made a spectacular diving attempt to reach a @entity92 shot in the sixth game of the third set and fell awkwardly on his shoulder			0
the @entity101 star needed treatment on the court and had to take a painkiller before rounding out an otherwise routine win			0
" yes it was a sharp pain when i fell			0
it was an awkward fall			0
i was just hoping nothing was going on bad with the joint , " he admitted later to reporters			0
" there was no damage in the joint , so i could play a few games after that			0
the muscle was still quite sore because of the impact , so all in all i 'm just glad to get through			0
" now there are two days off so i 'm going to recover and get ready			0
" @entity86 faces a tough last 16 clash against @entity121 , but has won 10 of his 11 meetings with the @entity93 , who is seeded 14th this year			1
defending champion @entity124 wasted little time on @entity69 later as he polished off @entity125 of @entity126 in their third round clash			1
third seed @entity124 won 6 - 2 6 - 3 6 - 2 and will play @entity130 of @entity131 for a place in the quarterfinals monday			1
but sixth seed @entity134 of the @entity13 went out in a late evening upset , losing in straight sets , 7 - 6 6 - 4 7 - 6 to @entity138 of @entity63 .			1

@entity12 beats her in straight sets
@entity86 survives *injury* scare to *progress* in men 's singles
