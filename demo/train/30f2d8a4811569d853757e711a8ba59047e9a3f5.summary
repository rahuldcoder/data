-- @entity1 and @entity2 were alike in so many ways , from their individual successes in business to their shared loved of adventure -- and flying			1
the couple helped lead and reshape @entity9 , @entity10 , for decades			1
they were believed to be the only passengers aboard a small plane that flew friday -- unresponsive and with its windows fogging over -- down the @entity17 , over stretches of open ocean and over @entity20 before crashing off the coast of @entity22			0
the @entity23 on sunday called off its search for the plane 's wreckage			0
while entrepreneurship was the bedrock of their business success , their impact on the city in @entity30 extended far beyond corporate offices and financial reports			0
@entity37 transformed swaths of the city beside @entity40 through a real estate firm that he led since 1970			1
in fact , he was profiled in the @entity44 newspaper in 2002 as one of the city 's " developers who shape our community			0
" his @entity49 describes itself as " @entity9 , @entity10 's largest and most diverse real estate development and property management company			1
" @entity2 made her mark as a business leader on her own , quitting her job as a math teacher in 1983 to start a firm called @entity57 , selling microwave cookware through catalogs and then through the @entity60 , according to a @entity62 and @entity63 profile of her in 2008			1

@entity57 employs 100 people and produces two national retail catalogs mailed to 35 million people annually , the firm 's website says			1
" remarkable human beings " with " a very close knit family " is how @entity74 , president of @entity75 describes the @entity76			0

you can see his fingerprints all over this community in a wonderful , very high impact way , " @entity74 said			0
@entity2 told @entity92 last april that she also found time to participate in a @entity93 , whitewater rafting and flying a plane			1
" but being an entrepreneur is the one i keep pursuing			0
it challenges my mind , my level of energy , my ability to deal with people , and my love of adventure			0
and someday , who knows ? maybe i really will get to the finish line , " @entity2 told the blog			2
@entity37 became a developer in a roundabout manner			2
@entity2 was playing tennis one day after graduating from @entity113 with an mba at 22 in the late 1960s when a tennis partner suggested they go into the real estate business by buying a two - unit house in @entity9 , the newspaper said in another story about him in 2008			1
@entity2 knew almost nothing about the real estate business			2
" it was absolutely a fluke , " @entity2 , the chief executive of @entity122 , told the newspaper			2
" he said , ' you want to go into business ? ' " @entity2 founded @entity49 in 1970 and often worked 80 hours a week			1
his real estate empire even expanded to @entity131 , where his firm has ownership in more than 300 acres of development property , the firm 's website says			2
and , the website adds , he is an avid pilot			0
" @entity1 spends some of his spare time on the ground -- gardening around his house with his wife , @entity140 ; and some in the sky -- flying his plane , " his profile says on the company 's website			0
@entity2 also served as president of the @entity147 and was an active board member in several local organizations , including the @entity150 of @entity9			1
the plane carrying the couple and a pilot was nonresponsive as it flew south from @entity9 and crashed into the @entity154 on friday			1
it was purchased for $ 3.7 million by @entity37 's @entity49 , according to aviation industry media reports			2
said @entity74 about @entity37 : " he has been flying for a long time			1
and he loved to fly			0
even one time i remember him telling me that he was flying to @entity160 to pick up a brand new plane and he was flying it back over the @entity163 all by himself			0
brand new right off the line			0
i do n't know how many planes he owned , but i do know that he loved flying and he flew often			1
" the company 's website says the firm owns and manages " more than 60 properties " and is headed by co-founder , ceo and managing partner , @entity37			1
even before any official announcement on the fate of those aboard the small plane , the children of @entity1 and @entity2 said in a statement they were " devastated by the tragic and sudden loss of our parents			2
" " they loved and appreciated the opportunity to help build the community of @entity9 , and we thank everyone in the community for their expressions of support , " the children said			1
