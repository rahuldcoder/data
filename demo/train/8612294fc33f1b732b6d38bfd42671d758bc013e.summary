-- what are iconic and twisted and no longer free ? pretzels aboard some @entity4 flights			1
@entity4 stopped serving complimentary snacks to passengers flying coach on domestic routes this week			1
the change is consistent with the carrier 's merger - partner @entity11 ' policy of food for purchase			2
" we are removing beverage snacks -- pretzels and @entity21 [ cookies ] -- in an effort to reduce costs and align ourselves with many of our network competitors , " @entity4 representative @entity16 said			1
@entity4 expects the pretzel and cookie cut could save $ 2.8 million annually			2
the move comes after some domestic airlines , including @entity30 and @entity31 , have already dropped free in - flight treats			1
@entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 still offer freebies			0
@entity33 , the last major legacy airline to provide them , has no plans to downsize its snack system			0
" we believe complimentary snacks are an appropriate component to the flight , " @entity33 representative @entity42 said			1
" there are no plans of changing that right now			0
" @entity50 of @entity51 said the once - popular " free snack " is no longer a travel staple or airline standard			2
" @entity4 's move is just another sign of legacy carriers reducing amenities in order to shave off a bit of their costs in an industry with cutthroat competition and razor - thin margins , " he said			1
rather than spending millions on reintroducing free in - flight food on @entity11 flights , @entity4 is staying consistent with its merger - partner and creating room for profit with snack packs starting at $ 3.95 on coach flights , he said			1
" for passengers , it means another ' full - service ' airline that eliminates even the most basic amenities , " @entity50 said			2
" of course , passengers wo n't walk away from @entity4 because their free snack has gone , but what is left of their sympathy for the airline is disappearing fast this way			1
although a small service , i think the free snack is quite valued by passengers			2
" hungry air travelers could blame rising fuel costs , said global aviation consultant @entity90 of @entity92			1
" it 's to be expected when the price goes over $ 3 a gallon , " he said			0
" they 're going to be doing whatever they can			0
i do n't know what they 'll cut next , but i 'm sure they 'll find something			0
" @entity90 said snack removal should n't be considered a calamity			0
passengers will shrug and fly anyway			0
" we 're talking about a bag of pretzels here , " he said			0
" i call that litter in the seat back pocket			0
