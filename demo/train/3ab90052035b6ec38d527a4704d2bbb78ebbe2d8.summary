@entity0 -- another day , another story about @entity3			1
the party - loving grandson of @entity6 has been exposed again , this time naked , playing strip billiards flanked by an equally naked girl			1
but what makes this story interesting -- and not just gratuitous tittle - tattle -- is the initial reluctance of the @entity13 press to even report the story in print or on their online digital media			1
it seems patently absurd to me that millions around the world can view the photographs online , yet no @entity13 newspaper would touch them			1
the big question is why ? when grainy photographs were first published on the net by @entity27 and seen by millions , the palace were forced to confirm it was him in the photos after speculation about the identity			0
in doing so his pr team reminded media outlets in the @entity13 that the pictures were taken in a hotel suite where the prince would have had a reasonable expectation of privacy			1
naked @entity3 scandal a watershed moment for @entity13 press this was a sharp move , given that every editor in this land would know that clause 3 of the @entity50 's @entity49 states : " it is unacceptable to photograph individuals in private places without their consent			1
" to publish in a @entity13 tabloid then would be a clear breach			2
but the newspapers have been left impotent by this move			0
they have again been scooped by the digital media			1
this is a dangerous precedent and in my view tantamount to returning to the good old , bad old days of royal reporting when in 1936 @entity62 and @entity63 newspapers freely reported on the affair of @entity68 and mrs. @entity69 while an establishment deal meant nothing was reported in the @entity13 newspapers			1
censorship of that royal story helped create the hysteria around the abdication crisis , polarizing opinion and may even have led to an atmosphere where the king felt he was forced to choose between love and duty			0
more importantly , surely -- like then -- the @entity13 paying public has a right to know what their royal family is up to			2
but @entity87 -- the inquiry established in the aftermath of the @entity91 phone - hacking scandal first revealed after both @entity94 @entity93 and @entity3 's phones were targeted -- no editor seemed , initially at least , is prepared to risk the backlash			2
amid all the media navel - gazing there seems to be a genuine fear that the press feels it is no longer drinking in " @entity101 " but time has already been called			2
embarrassing pics could harm a soldier 's career several ways but this latest naked @entity3 scandal is a watershed moment -- a moment when it is fair to ask : " who is wagging the dog ? " when i was a reporter on the tabloid @entity115 newspaper in 1991 old photos were circulated of prince @entity117 naked			1
like @entity3 he was a playboy prince , dubbed " @entity117 " by the tabloids			1
the then - @entity115 editor @entity119 bought the pictures and simply ran them across a double page inside spread ( with a crown jewel sticker to spare the prince 's blushes ) and waited for the reaction			0
the reaction was mps huffed and puffed their outrage in parliament and sales of the newspaper went up			0
i understand as we go to publication that @entity135 ( as the national @entity13 national newspapers are still collectively referred to ) has woken up to the story			1
picture desks were today busy negotiating for the pictures and new snaps in circulation			0
even if they do publish it is clear that the online media is calling the shots -- forcing the papers to react when in the past it was always the newspapers that led			1
a tale of two brothers in these times with newspaper sales figure nose - diving it is critical for them to decide are they leaders or followers			0
restricted by their own rules it leaves them exposed , giving the impression that they are slow to react			0
the problem newspapers face is that a new generation want news now , unrestricted and immediate			1
if they do not want to lose touch with that generation of readers altogether they have to at least compete with social and new media			2
as for @entity3 , i do have sympathy for him			2
he has been betrayed by somebody and caught with his guard down			0
he could argue that he could expect privacy in his own hotel room , but the truth is he should have known that @entity180 is not a place where you can expect anything other than trouble -- especially if you are one of the world 's most famous people			0
he has been let down before -- who can forget the @entity3 the @entity189 photos , again taken on a phone by somebody in a private venue			2
he could blame his protection team , i really do not understand why the @entity195 officers did not ask the girls for their mobile phones on security grounds			0
but in truth the only one who has let any one down is @entity3			0
how ' soldier prince ' @entity3 tore up royal rule book i know he is young , free and single -- but he is a prince with responsibilities			2
he is bright enough and should have learned from his mistakes			0
the shame is that he had turned the corner			0
he represented his grandmother admirably at the @entity209 and on a recent tour this year to @entity211			0
if the royal family is to be streamlined -- with @entity3 as one of the central public players -- he really has got to be more cautious about the company he keeps .			1
