an @entity1 passenger jet pilot said he saw a drone over @entity3 on monday			1
whether it 's true or not -- the @entity5 is investigating -- we are going to be hearing more and more about drones in @entity9 skies			1
i predicted two things about drones in an online essay for @entity14 in december 2011			1
those predictions turned out to be true			0
but there was something i did n't see coming			1
my first prediction was that drones would trouble the public more than other contemporary surveillance technologies , in part because of their association with war			1
events of the last year have borne this prediction out			0
opposition to the domestic use of drones has spread steadily across the @entity9			1
members of each house of @entity32 and each major party have raised questions about , or even proposed bills to limit , the use of drones for surveillance here at home			1
the @entity5 recently solicited comments on the privacy issues drones raise			1
the agency has granted 1,428 drone licenses so far , saying that typical purposes for the unmanned vehicles include " law enforcement , firefighting , border patrol , disaster relief , search and rescue , military training , and other government operational missions			2
" the second prediction was that our collective , visceral reaction to drones would force a national conversation about the adequacy of privacy law			1
the jury is still out on whether we will seriously re-examine privacy law			1
for instance , in @entity9 law today there is next to no reasonable expectation of privacy in public			1
if there were , @entity68 would not be able to post its @entity70			0
a police drone could likely hover over your backyard and record video without triggering constitutional scrutiny			0
last year , the @entity76 confronted the question of whether police following someone around continuously for a month using a gps device required probable cause			0
five of the nine justices worried aloud about continuous electronic surveillance , but ultimately the court found against the police officers , on the basis that they had triggered the @entity88 through the act of physically attaching the gps device to the suspect 's car -- something drone surveillance does not require			1
there is also little expectation of privacy in illegal possessions or activities			2
thus , a dog may sniff your bag at the airport ( and elsewhere ) without implicating the @entity104 , on the theory that the dog only alerts in the presence of contraband			0
no officer need see the contents of your bag unless you have something you should n't			2
@entity112 , meanwhile , can be equipped with a variety of sensors that serve the same function			0
the very next generation of drones may be able to detect grow lamps , guns , or marijuana and , again , report back only what is already illegal			2
this year , the @entity76 is set to decide whether a dog -- and , presumably , a drone -- could sniff even your house without a warrant			0
the court could take the opportunity either to limit or to seriously extend the contraband exception			0
in short , i looked up at the sky and saw the storm brewing			0
one thing i did not predict , however , was the danger to the drones themselves			2
the city of @entity138 , where i live , just ended its modest drone program over citizen protests , even though the drones could only stay up in the air for 15 minutes and were intended to support emergency response			2
the city of @entity145 , @entity146 , issued a moratorium on the use of drones within city limits			2
and this is nothing compared with what may happen in 2015 when the @entity5 paves the way for the use of drones by private parties			2
i do not blame opponents of drones			0
they raise legitimate concerns that have gone largely unaddressed			0
the @entity5 and others should have taken privacy seriously from the beginning			0
but i do worry that we are missing out on the transformative potential of drones			1
what are drones but flying smartphones , one app away from indispensable ? we could see drones accompanying early morning joggers , taking sport , wildlife , and other photography to a new level , or mapping out hard - to - reach geographic terrain			0
the possibilities , as @entity177 recently wrote , are endless			0
which is why i would rather see an end to bad privacy law than an end to drones .			1

@entity185 : like pilot 's claim , we are going to hear more reports of drones in @entity9 skies
*people* are *fearful* of drones because they are used in war and surveillance , he says
@entity185 : privacy law does n't cover most uses of drones , so many want to change laws
he says potential *creative* uses of drones are endless and bad laws could *prevent* them
