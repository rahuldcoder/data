@entity0 -- @entity2 , a @entity3 running for the second - highest office in @entity5 , received an endorsement wednesday that gives her campaign needed exposure and fund - raising opportunities			1
@entity10 , former chairman of the @entity11 , and his organization , @entity13 , endorsed @entity14 for lieutenant governor of @entity5 in an e-mail to the group 's 1 million members , including more than 38,000 in @entity5			1
" this year we have the best opportunity in a generation to turn @entity5 blue , " @entity10 said , referring to @entity19 and @entity20 , the @entity5 gubernatorial candidate and liberal star			1
" in @entity20 and @entity2 , we have the right team to seize that opportunity and defeat the extreme right			1
" the organization endorsed @entity29 immediately after she announced her candidacy in october			2
but the group waited six months before giving @entity14 the nod			1
the organization wanted to ensure that @entity14 's campaign , with its much lower profile , was capable of winning in the reliably red state			0
" we decided to back @entity2 after running our endorsement process and seeing ... how excited our members in @entity5 are about a @entity41 one - two punch and watching her put together the kind of grassroots campaign that we 're confident can win in the @entity5 , " @entity36 with @entity13 wrote in an e-mail			1
@entity14 welcomed the endorsement , thanking @entity13 for its " grass - roots support			2
" @entity47 are cautiously optimistic about their chances in @entity5 this year , noting that they have two top - notch candidates who could pull off an upset			1
while @entity29 has excited progressives around the country with her 13 - hour filibuster last june over abortion access , @entity14 has her own lengthy legislative record , and @entity47 insist she , as a @entity57 , is the ideal candidate to motivate women and @entity60 to vote			0
meet the woman who could turn @entity5 purple persuading @entity5 @entity47 to vote is its own challenge			1
the @entity5 , where more than one - third of the population is @entity57 , is plagued with low voter turnout			2
nearly two - thirds of eligible @entity57 voters stayed home in 2012			0
and the numbers get worse in nonpresidential election years			0
@entity14 's challenger is still undetermined			0
current lt. gov. @entity72 and state sen. @entity73 are locked in a runoff contest for the @entity76 nomination			0
both candidates are running to the right , making immigration a central component of their campaigns , which @entity47 say could also help drive @entity60 to the polls			2
@entity14 must raise significant amounts of money to be competitive in the vast , populous state			0
the latest fund - raising figures available are old -- from january -- but total a mere $ 290,000			0
@entity13 raised more than $ 50,000 for @entity29 in the first 24 hours after its endorsement			2
that 's an extremely high bar to match for a @entity19 endorsement , but obviously one her campaign hopes is reached .			0
