-- @entity1 , the @entity2 and last of the original 29 @entity4 code talkers , passed away june 4 at age 93			1
when an elder dies in @entity8 country -- especially someone as revered and decorated as @entity10 , the @entity12 veteran -- we , @entity8 , feel it , all of us , regardless of tribe or nation			2
we are also reminded that , not long ago , in the 19th and 20th centuries , native american culture , including our languages , was considered a threat to @entity22 national security			1
then , the government worked in collusion with @entity26 institutions to stamp out @entity28 languages , including @entity4			1
" a great general has said that the only good @entity8 is a dead one , " capt. @entity31 famously read from a paper at an 1892 convention			0
" in a sense , i agree with the sentiment , but only in this : that all the @entity8 there is in the race should be dead			0
kill the @entity8 in him , and save the man			0
" @entity31 was the founder of the @entity8 boarding schools , institutions charged with turning the " @entity28 " into the " noble savage			1
" native americans : we 're not your mascots @entity1 attended one of these schools as a child , and was punished when he spoke @entity4			1
one ca n't help but think that , had it not been for the resilience of the @entity4 people and their resistance to these early oppressive @entity58 policies , it 's quite possible that @entity12 could have ended differently			1
without the use of the @entity4 language that was once discouraged by @entity58 policy , the @entity22 military could have lost a distinct advantage over its enemy			1
@entity1 's death is a reminder that @entity22 's strength lies in its diversity			1
@entity8 , who have not always been included in the @entity58 story , should be remembered and honored for their contributions			0
before the arrival of the @entity73 , there were between 300 and 500 unique languages spoken throughout what is now the @entity22 and @entity76			1
today , there are fewer than 200 , and that number will continue to decrease if @entity58 indigenous language revitalization efforts are n't considered paramount to the continuity of @entity28 communities by the @entity22			1
opinion : @entity83 may throw flag on n - word , but what about the ' @entity87 ' ? recently , a neighbor and i were discussing @entity28 languages			2
he was curious why more @entity28 elders " do n't just pass on the language to the next generation			1
" i told him that many of said elders still suffer from the trauma they experienced in the @entity26 boarding school system , and remembered what @entity98 told me recently			2
" they 'd pierce your tongue if you spoke your language ! " my elder recalled			2
" or they 'd make you stand in front of the classroom and they 'd tell you to stick your tongue out and then they 'd whip it with a wooden ruler , just for speaking our language			0
" @entity98 knew our @entity115 language growing up , she said , and very well			0
but she has lost it , she said			0
she understands it , but it 's all but left her , courtesy of the boarding schools			1
i told my neighbor , who said he was a third - generation @entity122 , that his people 's language could die in @entity125 , but there is no threat that it will become an extinct language any time soon			0
" there are more @entity130 speaking @entity130 every day right across the @entity131 , " i said			0
" you could board a plane or hop a ship today and travel to your home country and hear your people 's language reverberating off @entity130 walls			0
we , @entity8 , do n't share in that luxury			0
this is our home country			0
our languages are invariably on the brink of extinction , especially since we are 1 % of the population			0
so when a @entity28 language dies , it 's forever gone			1
" our elders tell us that when a language dies , so , too , does the culture			1
but all is not lost			0
there are various campaigns to revitalize @entity28 languages			2
the state of @entity157 , for example , passed a law stating that @entity8 who speak their language can teach it to students for credit at secondary schools under the category " @entity164			2
" maybe one day all @entity8 will , again , be fluent speakers of their language -- just like @entity10 , the warrior			0
indeed , the world would be a richer place for it			0
my hope is that when president @entity173 visits with our @entity28 leaders this month at @entity176 , @entity177 , he will be reminded of the significant contributions of @entity28 peoples like @entity10			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : the death of original code talker @entity1 is a significant cultural loss

**author** : @entity28 elders say when a language dies , so does the culture
without the use of the @entity4 language , the @entity22 military could have lost a war , **author** says
