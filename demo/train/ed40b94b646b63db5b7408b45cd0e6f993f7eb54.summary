call them drones ; call them toy airplanes with digital cameras dropped into their girths			1
either way , @entity7 defense officials said on friday they were sure that they came from @entity9 and that they were up to no good			1
three diminutive single - engine unmanned propeller planes that look like they could have come from a hobby shop were found on the ground in march and april in parts of the @entity7 near the border with the northern communist regime			1
though the low - tech buzzers do n't seem to represent a major danger , they come in the shadow of @entity9 missile launches and the impending countdown to the test of a nuclear device			1
and they made it through @entity7 air defenses			1
@entity29 officials in @entity30 immediately suspected that the sky - blue colored fliers belonged to @entity33			2
they formed an investigation team with the @entity35 in mid-april to analyze the " travel log file " and photos taken by the drones and announced the results on friday			0
scientists found a " smoking gun that all three were sent from @entity9 and are programmed to return to @entity9 , " @entity7 defense spokesman @entity40 said			1
photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path , he said			0
precarious cargo had the mechanical carrier pigeons made it back home , they would have delivered precarious cargo , but it would have been far from precious			0
@entity52 - made digital cameras , which look like they could be of the consumer variety , were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the @entity7 from around the border region			1
all three were programmed to fly over military facilities , and two of them had images of targets of military interest -- strategically important islands near the demilitarized zone , and the @entity66 , residence and office of @entity7 's president @entity69			1
images from the third drone were not available to @entity7 investigators			2
a wild ginseng digger had stumbled upon the plane and had deleted its memory card so he could use it himself , the @entity73 reported			0
the planes were not capable of transmitting images back to @entity9 in real time , and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to @entity86 , @entity40 said in a previous briefing			1
limited capabilities there is little danger the drones could have made it far into @entity7			1
the type of drone is not used for long - range missions , a defense analyst said			0
instead they 're better suited to see what the enemy is up to on the other side of a hill or wall			0
" it has quite a small range , it does n't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours			0
you would use those to see what the other guys are doing in a battlefield environment , " said @entity107 , the @entity108 editor of @entity110 magazine			0
" they 're very much closely built off a remote - controlled aircraft that you can buy in a toy store			0
they 're just a militarized version of that , " @entity107 said			0
the @entity7 drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the @entity35 in @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 , he said			2
they would also not make much of a weapon , if someone decided to stuff explosives into them , @entity40 has said			0
" even if they are to be used for future attacks , ( they ) can only carry 2 - 3 kilograms of @entity136 and can not cause huge damage			0
" @entity9 has flaunted similar , larger uavs at military parades in recent years , and some of them have been spiked with explosives , @entity107 said			2
@entity144 footage shows @entity9 exercises using them as missiles , but it 's an expensive way to build a bomb , he said			2
and it could only take out a single vehicle or ship			0
@entity151 is the season @entity153 is traditionally a time of high tensions between @entity33 on the one side and @entity30 and @entity157 on the other			1
annual @entity35 - @entity7 joint military drills , that ended on april 7 , drew criticism from @entity9 , which views the exercises as " dress rehearsals for invasion , " according to analyst @entity164 from the @entity165			1
in march , @entity33 fired two mid-range ballistics missiles off its eastern coast , in an apparent response to the drills			0
days later , the two sides fired hundreds of shells across the @entity172 , their disputed maritime border			0
the shells were shot into the sea , not at hard targets			0
@entity9 also warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device			2
" it 's all good stuff because it allows the @entity9 to do something provocative and slightly annoying which might embarrass @entity7 , but it 's not provocative enough to create a proper military response , " @entity107 said			1
slipping through the drones would fit well into that category , since they slipped through @entity7 air defenses			1
they are made of polycarbonate , which is difficult to detect with radar , according to @entity7 's @entity187 news agency			2
they fly at an average speed of about 110 km per hour ( 68 mph ) at an altitude of 1.3 km ( .8 miles )			0
they were launched in @entity9 from three locations , @entity7 's defense ministry said : near the @entity194 area , 27 kilometers southeast of @entity195 and 17 kilometers from @entity196			1
@entity7 's defense ministry called the intrusion by the drones a violation of the truce that ended the bloody conflict between @entity202 in 1953			2
@entity40 said @entity30 will send a warning via the @entity204 to @entity33 and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones .			1

three diminutive single - engine unmanned propeller planes were found in march and april
they look like hobby shop model airplanes with consumer cameras shoved into them
they do n't have strong military or *spy* capabilities , but they made it through air defenses
@entity153 is typically a time of high provocations between @entity9 and @entity7
