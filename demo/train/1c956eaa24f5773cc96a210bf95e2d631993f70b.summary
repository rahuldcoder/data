-- you do n't have to be an expert to ask yourself the question : how in the world , with today 's technology , can a commercial airplane go missing ? it 's a question , but also an expression of disbelief			1
those who get lost driving can use @entity12			0
if you lose your @entity15 , there 's an app to track it down			1
scientists successfully plotted the course for a spacecraft that landed on a speeding comet			0
but something goes wrong aboard a 123 - foot , 67 - ton passenger jet , and rescuers must resort to scouring the ocean ? " why is it easier to find an @entity15 ( than ) to find a plane ? " one @entity26 user , @entity25 , asked			1
there are dozens of similar questions on social media			0
they hint at the same sentiment : in a world where people 's locations are tracked for everything from map apps to what ads appear on a web browser , why does @entity35 's gaze avoid the skies ? " why , in this day and age , do we rely on the physical recovery of black boxes ? flight data should be continuously streamed to the cloud , " read a tweet by @entity49			1
of course , this question has been asked before			1
the disappearance of @entity54 on sunday was the second time this year that a plane vanished			1
debris from the @entity59 has been found , the airline said tuesday , and two bodies have been found			1
@entity61 vanished , too , and remains missing 10 months later			0
at that time , @entity62 , the former head of the @entity63 , called for upgrades to the tracking capabilities of planes that fly for extended periods over water			1
the airline industry has invested billions of dollars in safety features , " yet many allow their aircraft to fall off any direct tracking capability as they fly over vast ocean distances and remote locations , confident that these planes will occasionally check in and reappear as they near the other side of the blacked - out area , " @entity62 wrote			2
in a preliminary report on @entity61 , @entity80 aviation authorities recommended that the @entity82 look into the benefits of introducing a standard for real - time tracking of commercial aircraft			0
the technology exists to track flight data in real time , but even after tragedies such as @entity61 , cost and government bureaucracy are cited as obstacles to implementation			1
" millions of us can be located immediately through technology in our handheld cell phones , but a 300,000 - pound @entity98 with 239 souls on board disappears from the face of the @entity102 , " @entity62 wrote , referring to @entity61			2
" @entity103 has the capability of photographing stars billions of light - years away , and yet our best minds are forced to guess where this plane might be			2
" another @entity26 user phrased the thought this way : " if we have astronauts reaching safely the @entity113 , why do we still have missing planes on @entity102 ? " @entity0 aviation analyst @entity115 says it is time for world leaders to take concrete action on upgrading technology for tracking planes			1
making recommendations is n't enough , she said			0
there need to be laws			0
" i think at this day and age , there 's really no excuse for ( not having real - time tracking ) , " @entity115 said on @entity0 's " @entity124 " on monday			0
" i mean , the kind of technology , it 's already here			2
we do n't have to wait to develop it			0
those planes could be sending out continuous signals			2
" two companies with products on the market for real - time streaming are flyht and @entity140			0
but the technology is not catching on with major carriers			2
cost has been the biggest hurdle , though the technology is slowly finding its way onto airplanes , said @entity148 , managing partner at @entity149			0
airlines have lobbied for governments to contribute money to equipping planes with new technology , arguing that it is not just an airline issue , but a national security consideration			1
the question of who will pay for the technology is beginning to get answered , but not as quickly as travelers would like to see , @entity157 said			1
so , those in disbelief are not alone in wondering how in today 's world a plane could simply get lost			0
it 's just not an easy question to answer .			0

new : debris from @entity54 flight has been recovered , officials say ; two bodies found
the question : how can we lose a plane ?
there is pressure for new technology to be *installed* on planes
but there are obstacles that remain
