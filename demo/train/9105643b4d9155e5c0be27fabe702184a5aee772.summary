-- a leading tennis player believes he has been " treated like a criminal " after being hit with an 18 - month ban for flouting doping regulations and plans to take his case to the @entity7			1
world no. 53 @entity8 was suspended by the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) thursday after being found guilty of failing to provide a blood sample in a drugs test during april 's @entity13			1
but @entity14 has rejected the charge , alleging the doctor conducting the blood test allowed him to miss the procedure and says he will now appeal the decision			1
" the doctor in charge of the testing told me that i looked very pale and ill and that i could skip the test if i wrote an explanation letter to the @entity10 about it , " he said in a statement			1
" she dictated the letter to me and let me go without giving blood			2
she was very helpful and understanding			2
" now i 'm being charged for refusing to undergo a blood test without justification			1
this is a real nightmare			2
" i put my trust in the @entity7 in @entity34 , i really hope they will look for the truth and find it			1
" the 27 - year - old @entity14 confirmed that he underwent a test the following day by the same doping control officer with the result coming back negative			1
he also revealed that he had never previously missed a test and had undergone several blood and urine examinations during his career			1
but the @entity10 has taken a different stance on the story , insisting that the doping control officer had told @entity14 that " she could not advise him as to whether his reason for not providing a blood sample was valid , and that no such assurances were given by her			1
" " i feel like i 'm being treated like a criminal , " added @entity14 as he contemplated the 18 - month ban			1
" i have a fear of the needle and i always have trouble drawing blood			2
i am clean and will always be clean throughout my career			0
" i just had the wrong doctor , who did n't tell me at all that i was risking anything			0
she showed me a letter of the @entity10 saying she is in charge of the decisions and i trusted her completely			1
" i wish i had recorded the discussion , there would never have been a case if i had			0
" this enormous sanction makes me speechless			0
it feels like the world that i help building day - by - day has let me down			2
it is the worst feeling you can imagine			0
" @entity14 reached a career high of 12 in 2011 and has won $ 4.5 million in prize money during his career			1
he is the third tennis player to be hit with a ban for drug violations in 2013			2
in may , @entity80 's @entity79 was handed an eight - and - a half - month ban after testing positive for diuretics , furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide			1
in february , @entity85 of the @entity86 was banned for six months after testing positive for sibutramine , a substance which is often found in weight - loss products			2
in march , the @entity10 confirmed it would introduce biological passports to tackle drug cheats			1
each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use			0
the scheme was welcomed by the world 's top players with @entity101 telling @entity0 that it was " naive " to think tennis was free of players who use drugs to enhance their performance			2
but @entity14 believes he was simply misled and insists he has no problem with the current drug regulations			1
" the doping rules are strict and they must remain strict			0
but this was a clear mistake from the on - site doping control officer who was also a doctor and the person in charge to decide , " added the @entity109			1
" she let me go and reassured me			0
in my opinion , once she found out that she did n't follow procedures she turned her back on me			2
" i am destroyed and exhausted			0
the whole period i have been thinking about this issue and it 's not over , so i ca n't really describe it			0
" i am not even angry with the doctor			0
i believe that maybe she was told her organization that she made a big mistake letting me go			0
she backed up and tried to save her job			0
" i am a fighter and i will try to fight together with my team and my lawyers but i am quite destroyed now			0
i hope this nightmare will come to a good end			0
i really want to continue playing			0
i do n't deserve this			0
