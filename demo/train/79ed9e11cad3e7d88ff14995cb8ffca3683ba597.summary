" i am not defending @entity4 or his regime , nor am i defending what it has done in @entity18 and elsewhere , " @entity9 said in the statement released by @entity2 's production company , as - @entity14			1
but , he said , " the issue is n't one of @entity18 and solving its problems ; the issue is one of making excuses for more foreign interference in the @entity27 ' countries in the framework of the contemporary @entity29			2
" the warrant issued by the @entity31 earlier this month accuses @entity4 of war crimes and crimes against humanity , charges he denies			1
in response , @entity5 ordered 13 international aid groups to leave the country , groups that the @entity39 says provide roughly half the assistance delivered in @entity18			1

" for many long years , it continued to back down and backtrack in front of @entity46 pressure			0
" he further accused @entity5 of expelling members of the mujahedeen who had sought refuge there , particularly @entity52 , and declaring " in an audacious lie that they had left voluntarily , then attempting to beg payment for that from the @entity58 regime and the @entity59			1
" @entity9 asked , " why has n't the @entity39 moved to protect the @entity60 in @entity61 from @entity63 barbarity and criminality , while it pretends to cry over the suffering of the people of @entity18 ? why has n't the @entity39 and the international community intervened to lift the siege from @entity61 , while it pretends to cry over the people of @entity18 being deprived of relief and aid ? " " the @entity5 regime continued to pant for @entity59 approval , and it agreed to the division of the @entity5 , paved the way for the imminent secession of the south , provided all the information it had on the emigrants and mujahedeen to the @entity59 government , and handed over some of them to the regimes of treason and criminality in their countries , " @entity9 said			1
" but despite all that , the senior criminals were n't satisfied with it and continued to besiege it with demands and interference , even going so far as to demand the arrest of its leaders and prominent figures			0
" he said he wants to send a message to @entity27 in @entity5 , telling them they are being targeted so that @entity99 can be eliminated from the country			0
" and in order for @entity99 to be eliminated from the @entity5 , a justification must be found for @entity104 military intervention , " he said			0
