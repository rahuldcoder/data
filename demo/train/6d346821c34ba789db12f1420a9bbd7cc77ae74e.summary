@entity0 -- the @entity4 medical examiner 's office thursday classified the death of former @entity7 linebacker @entity6 as a suicide , but the finding will probably do little to answer questions swirling since he was found with a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the chest			1
toxicology results and the narrative that could reveal contributing factors in the death could take weeks or longer to complete , said @entity18 of the medical examiner 's office			1
since news broke that @entity6 was found wednesday in his @entity22 , @entity23 , home with a gunshot wound to the chest , there has been speculation about whether repeated hits to his head over his 20 - year pro career could be a contributing factor			1
1994 @entity34 team carries dark legacy there is no evidence @entity6 suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( @entity39 ) , a degenerative disease brought on by multiple concussions , though friends and family have stepped forward to say the legendary linebacker suffered a number of hits to the head during his career			1
as a linebacker , he played " the most havoc - ridden position on the team			0
he suffered many concussions , so there is a strong sense that it played a role , " said @entity53 , a pastor and @entity6 family friend			1
@entity53 , who stood next to @entity6 's grief - stricken mother as she faced a sea of cameras to discuss her son 's death , said the family had received calls from researchers asking to study his brain			1
" @entity70 taking the shot to the chest makes sense that he would want his head examined , " he said			0
the medical examiner 's office , in a statement thursday , said it was awaiting the family 's decision regarding study of @entity6 's brain			1
it said a final autopsy report may take up to 90 days to complete			0
the autopsy confirmed @entity6 died of a self - inflicted gunshot wound to the chest			1
while @entity53 did not identify the researchers making the requests , among the institutions the family could donate @entity6 's brain to is @entity91 for the @entity92 , the research center that found former @entity94 safety @entity93 suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits			1
@entity93 committed suicide , shooting himself in the chest in 2011 and leaving a suicide note that said he wanted his brain studied for possible damage			2
seau 's death follows last month 's suicide of former @entity107 safety @entity105 , the lead plantiff in a class action lawsuit against the @entity7 over concussion - related injuries			1
the lawsuit names more than 1,000 professional players			0
in both cases , @entity113 and @entity93 exhibited symptoms of repetitive head trauma : memory lapses , anger and deep depression , according to family and friends			2
and in both cases , researchers found signs of brain trauma			0
more than 100 former professional football players added their names thursday to the growing list of people suing the @entity7 , saying it " repeatedly refuted the connection between concussions and brain injury , " according to the lawsuit filed in @entity135 in @entity136 by attorney @entity137			2
the @entity7 has repeatedly dismissed the allegations , saying player safety is a priority			0
" any allegation that the @entity7 intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit , " it said			0
@entity6 does not appear to have participated in any of the pending lawsuits against the @entity7			2
@entity1 's chief medical correspondent , dr. @entity145 , warned against drawing a conclusion in @entity6 's case , though he said there were striking similarities between his death and other cases involving football players			1
the only way to determine if @entity6 suffered @entity39 is to analyze the brain tissue for " hallmarks of the dementia - like disease , " @entity145 said			1
" we ca n't know , unless @entity6 's " brain is analyzed in this way , whether his death was related to @entity39 , he said			1
though @entity6 had no reported documented history of concussions , @entity145 said " the hits do n't necessarily result in diagnosed concussion , but the brain is rattled over and over again			1
" @entity6 family friend @entity166 said the former linebacker made a comment recently that appeared to indicate a possible issue			1
" @entity6 had wanted to donate his brain to science to the study of concussive injuries , " he told @entity1 affiliate @entity170 of @entity4			2
@entity6 was drafted into the @entity7 in the first round in 1990 out of the @entity176			2

@entity6 amassed 1,526 tackles , 56.5 sacks and 18 interceptions in his 20 - season career			2
seau 's death rocked the @entity23 city of @entity4 , where he was a member of the 1994 @entity34 -- the team 's only @entity194 appearance			1
his reputation as a fierce tackler -- with a heart of gold for his community work -- earned him admiration and a legion of fans			0
through most of his career he avoided negative publicity that plagued some in the @entity7			0
but in october 2010 , he made headlines when he was charged with domestic violence after an incident with his girlfriend , and then hours after his arrest he drove off a cliff and crashed on the beach			0
investigators later ruled the crash an accident , saying he fell asleep at the wheel			0
on wednesday , @entity6 made headlines again			2
