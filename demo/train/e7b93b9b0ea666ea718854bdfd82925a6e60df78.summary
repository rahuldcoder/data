-- when i lived in @entity3 , @entity4 , every " @entity5 " movie release was a cause for celebration among a certain group of friends			1
we saw new releases and dvd versions as soon as we could , a tradition that brought us great joy and hours of entertainment			2
now , the first " @entity17 " movie is coming out this weekend , but i live in @entity18			1
what 's a geek to do ? for this one , the answer is to fly back to @entity3 for 24 hours to see the movie with my friends at the legendary @entity23			1
thanks to air miles , i 'm doing it for about $ 15			2
my decision has earned funny looks and awkward conversational pauses , but i 'm excited about my " vacation concentrate " : no wasting time with filler , just 24 hours of fun			1
" you 'd be surprised how long a one - or two - day vacation feels if you really get away and go somewhere different , " said @entity35 blogger @entity34			1
" i went to @entity38 on a long weekend ( three full days ) last winter because i found a fantastic flight deal , and i came back renewed and recharged ! " events like movies or ballgames are often the impetus behind these quick trips			1
@entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 , traveled to @entity48 , @entity49 , and @entity50 , @entity51 , to see @entity52 in concert			0
she also took 24 hours to see the @entity54 in @entity50			1
" the strange thing is that i am really not a concert junkie or anything , " she said			0
" i just feel that these guys and groups that i grew up listening to are aging and i want to be able to see them live when i can			0
hoping the @entity62 go on one more tour -- you can bet i will fly somewhere for that ! " @entity65 of @entity66 , @entity67 , and her husband took a one - day trip to @entity49 last month to catch the superpopular @entity71 show " @entity72			1
" " we bought the tickets and figured we 'd plan the full trip later , " she said			0
" when we got around to getting our flights , we realized that it would be easier to just go in and out in one day			2
" not to mention cheaper : " with hotel rooms at $ 300 to $ 400 for the holiday season , it was much cheaper to just do one day			2
we got to go to brunch at our favorite restaurant in the city , explored the @entity84 store in @entity85 ( my husband is a tech nerd ) and then saw the show			0
" one - day trips are n't all fun and games , though			1
the smaller travel window means more risk of chaos or outright cancellation if there are any problems			0
@entity97 of @entity98 , @entity47 , got 50 - yard - line tickets to a @entity101 game from her husband one year , but a massive winter storm nearly ended the celebration			2
their plane was the only one to make it out of @entity18 , but they arrived too late for the car service to the game			0
@entity110 says she and her husband made it for the second half " by going the trains , planes and automobiles route and got yelled at by some oaf who had taken our seats for not being a ' real fan ' for showing up late			2
after about eight hours of travel just to get to this game ! " @entity34 says flexibility is the key to a quick trip			1
" for example , returning on a sunday from a weekend getaway will typically cost you more than returning on a monday or tuesday			0
" @entity110 offers advice that works for just about every traveler , no matter how long the trip : " i just ca n't get stressed about it			0
if we make it , wonderful			0
if we do n't , it 's a story			0
the main thing for me is to persevere with humor , to be nice to everyone who 's helping you and realize that it 's often out of your control			0
" have you taken a one - day trip worth sharing ? what kind of event or situation would make you want to go somewhere for 24 hours ? let us know in the comments !			1
