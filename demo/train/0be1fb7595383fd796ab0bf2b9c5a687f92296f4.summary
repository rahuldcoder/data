-- in 1965 @entity1 made tv history and changed the face of television			1
he co-starred in @entity5 's " @entity6 , " becoming the first @entity9 - @entity8 male to star in a prime - time network drama -- and won three emmys doing it			1
in 1984 , two decades later , @entity1 made another pioneering tv achievement , reviving the then - dormant sitcom form by starring as the patriarch of a loving family called the @entity16			1
the @entity17 soon was @entity19 's no. 1 show , and helped make @entity5 television 's no. 1 network -- all while blasting another programming myth : that white viewers would n't embrace an all - black tv show			1
now , 30 years after doctor and dad @entity26 , and almost 50 years after tennis trainer and secret agent @entity27 , @entity5 is returning to the @entity1 well one more time -- and hoping his stardom , fan base and legacy can bring some much - needed magic to broadcast television in the 21st century			1
the @entity35 website has reported that @entity5 and @entity1 , partnered with producer @entity36 ( part owner of the company that produced " @entity17 " ) , have reached an agreement to produce a family sitcom starring @entity1			1
the question is , can lightning strike thrice ? can @entity1 make tv history yet again ? and is it even fair to expect or ask him to ? remember , first of all , that not every @entity1 tv series has been a guaranteed hit			1
after " @entity6 , " @entity1 scored big in the children 's television arena , with the animated " @entity49 and the @entity50 " and his playful appearances on " @entity52 " and " @entity53			1
" but his prime - time series did n't always score as successes			0
his first @entity5 series after " @entity6 , " the 1969 sitcom " the @entity57 , " showcased him as a high - school coach and phys ed teacher			1
it was a very smart series , and positioned @entity1 's @entity63 in a strong position of authority , but it did n't catch on			2
his next series -- for @entity67 this time -- came in 1972 : a weekly variety series called " @entity69			0
" its key ingredients , in addition to @entity1 's weekly comic monologues , included dancer - actress @entity74 , pretend drunk @entity75 , and bandleader @entity76			1
but this show , in an era when variety shows were as ubiquitous as reality shows are today , was gone after one season			0
1976 's " cos , " for @entity82 , was a variety show aimed at youngsters			0
then came " @entity17 , " eight seasons of which singlehandedly moved tv from the topical and raw comedy of @entity91 's sitcoms to an era in which television parents regained control , and family civility returned			2
after " @entity17 " were more @entity1 series , ones that never captured the same zeitgeist : @entity5 's " @entity104 " ( 1994 - 95 ) , and @entity67 's " @entity1 " sitcom ( 1996 - 2000 , re-teaming him with " @entity17 " tv spouse @entity100 ) , and an " @entity103 " sequel of sorts : @entity67 's " @entity105 " ( 1998 - 2000 ) , with @entity1 interviewing children			1
in other words , over his tv career , @entity1 has hit as many singles and doubles as home runs			2
at 76 , does @entity1 have another long - ball miracle in him ? my bet is that he can , indeed , do it again -- provided he swings for the fences , and that @entity5 does nothing to impede @entity1 from following his instincts and doing precisely what he wants			1
the major warning flag , on @entity5 right now , is " the @entity121 , " which has returned another ' 80s @entity5 sitcom icon to television -- but not successfully , because the network seemed to think that merely signing @entity125 and bringing him back was enough			0
you need the right role , the right writers and the right cast , and you have to put them all together at the right time			0
but @entity1 , like a comedy locust , seems amazingly designed to surface every two or three decades and capture the imagination			0
in the right vehicle , he can do it again			0
his timing and his jokes were on full , hilarious display in last year 's @entity142 standup special , whose title may prove prophetic : " @entity1 : far from finished			2
" can his humor still work today , when , as always , he avoids going " blue " ? it certainly worked on @entity142			0
@entity146 , black -- @entity1 never has made color more of a priority than universality			2
if i were given a vote in designing @entity1 's 21st - century sitcom comeback vehicle , i 'd craft it as a dual home life / workplace vehicle , like the classic " the @entity156			1
" at home , let @entity1 be the family grandpa , holding court over a loving , lively , extended family			0
but let him to go work beyond retirement age , too , as a tenured college professor or a veteran media pundit on a tv talk show			0
either way , he 'd get to vent about current events , forgotten history and anything else the real @entity165 would care to bring to the viewing public via prime - time tv			2
including , of course , his observations on family and other parts of his still - funny monologues			0
more than 50 years after he released his first comedy album , @entity1 is a very funny fellow			0
right ? @entity178 ... the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181			0

@entity181 : @entity1 made tv history with starring roles in " @entity6 , " " @entity17 "
he says there 's news he *'ll* be , at 76 , in a new tv show . can lightning strike thrice ?
he says despite @entity1 's two ground - breaking shows , he 's had quite a few that have failed
@entity181 : he can score again , but only if @entity5 lets him swing for fences . he 's still hilarious
