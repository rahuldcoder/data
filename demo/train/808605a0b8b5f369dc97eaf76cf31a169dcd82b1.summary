-- pardoned but hardly chastened , ex-president @entity2 defended his administration 's secrecy and wiretaps in combative testimony before a @entity8 grand jury following his resignation , newly released documents reveal			1
archivists released nearly 50,000 pages of records and about 45 minutes of audio recordings thursday , including hundreds of pages of transcripts of @entity2 's june 1975 testimony			1
special prosecutors were still trying to document the breadth of the scandal that had driven him from power nearly a year earlier , while @entity2 did his best to defend his presidency			2
" i mean it is your job , and i want the jury and the special prosecutors to kick the hell out of us for wiretapping and for the @entity32 and the rest , because obviously you may have concluded it is wrong , " @entity2 is quoted in one of the transcripts			2
" but i want to say this : that if as a result of the secret negotiations that we have had we have changed the world , which we have ; if as a result , we have saved @entity44 lives , which we did in @entity45 by shortening a war -- the secret @entity41 bombings saved at least 10,000 lives , as i have told you ; if as a result , we 'll have made some progress in reducing the threat of nuclear destruction by arms limitation with the @entity54 ; and if the other choice is to have what we call total openness , with no security whatever , then the @entity44 is finished as a great power			2
maybe a lot of people do n't care , but i care a great deal			0
i think all of you care a great deal			0
" the material includes @entity2 's recollection of one of the most unusual moments of his presidency -- a pre-dawn meeting at the @entity71 with student demonstrators outraged by his 1970 invasion of @entity41			1
@entity2 said he realized he could not convince them the move was needed to shorten the @entity76 , but told them he hoped they would " give us a hearing on some other issues where we might agree			2
" @entity2 left office august 9 , 1974 , as @entity83 considered whether to impeach him over the @entity8			1
the debacle began with a bungled burglary of the @entity87 offices by @entity2 campaign operatives before the 1972 election			0
the investigations that followed led to the exposure of a wide - ranging @entity93 plan to sabotage political opponents , efforts to stop leaks by a @entity93 squad known as the " @entity32 " and @entity2 's orders to cover up the effort			1
@entity2 's successor , @entity100 , issued him a blanket pardon about a month after the resignation , foreclosing any prospect that the former president would ever face the prison terms many of his aides served			1
@entity2 dodged questions about the mysterious 18Â½ - minute gap in his @entity110 tapes that has fascinated historians for more than three decades , telling prosecutors that he " practically blew my stack " when he learned of it			1
he suggested it happened while his secretary , @entity117 , was transcribing the tape , but characterized it as an accident			0
he mocked others in the @entity93 who suggested other causes as " amateurs " and " clowns			0
" he recounted ordering then - @entity93 chief of staff @entity125 to " find out how this damn thing happened , " then apologized to the grand jurors for swearing			1
" i am sorry , i was n't supposed to use profanity , " he said			0
" you have enough on the tapes			0
" @entity0 's @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0

" we have changed the world " despite @entity8 , @entity2 told grand jurors
