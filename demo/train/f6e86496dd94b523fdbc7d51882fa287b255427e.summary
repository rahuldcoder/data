-- it 's time for those of us who are good men to start acknowledging the role that male socialization plays in domestic and sexual violence			1
as good men , we must begin to acknowledge and own our responsibility to be part of the solution to ending violence against women and girls			1
what is a good man ? a good man is a man who believes women should be respected			1
a good man would not assault a woman			0
a good man believes in equality for women			2
a good man honors the women in his life			2
a good man , for all practical purposes , is a nice guy			0
we believe this to be the majority of men			2
there is a minority of men who perpetuate a tremendous amount of violence against women			1
these men are counting on good men to stay true to rules -- the rules that actually allow them to be who they are in the presence of good men			2
these rules are what we call the ingredients in the " man box			0
" these rules are also the foundation of how we as men collectively define manhood			2
the man box teaches us as men that we must be tough , strong , aggressive and dominating			2
we are taught not to show feelings and emotions			1
we are taught that we should be in charge , leaders and protectors			2
and if we fall short we lose our status and are placed outside the box			0
@entity57 : @entity58 on the case for collaborative consumption outside the box is reserved for women , and for men defined as being less than fully male , or " woman - like "			1
the man box at times can be hypermasculine and extremely homophobic			0
with that being said , " outside the man box " is a place most men do n't want to be			0
so we find ourselves staying true to the rules of the man box , many times operating from a subconscious place , just on remote control , doing what 's natural to us			0
we as good men do n't realize that every time we tell a boy that he is acting like a girl , we are actually saying that girls are " less than			0
" we all know that a college freshman woman is known on campus as " fresh meat			0
" and while we know that domestic violence is wrong and a crime , it continues to be tolerated in many of our communities			0
it is with this understanding that our work , our vision , is not to beat up on good men , but instead to help us understand , through a process of re-education and accountability , that with all of our goodness , we still have been socialized to maintain a system of domination , dehumanization and oppression over women			1
while we as good men would never hurt women , our collective socialization is the foundation that violence against women is built upon			1
@entity57 : @entity105 on the quirky world of " manspaces " there are three key aspects of male socialization that are the foundation of men 's violence against women : men viewing women as " less than ; " men treating women as property ; men viewing women as objects			1
we as good men have to find our voice and began to challenge this collective socialization of men			0
we as good men have to teach our sons and other young men how to truly respect and promote equality for women			1
we as good men have to envision the world we want to see for our daughters and other girls -- and in that world how would we want to see our sons and other men acting and behaving			0
we must as good men understand that the world we want for our daughters and other girls wo n't happen through osmosis			0
we as good men have to break out of the man box , stand up and speak out to end violence against women and girls			1
