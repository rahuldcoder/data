-- air travel security is being increased as authorities continue to question how a man got explosives on a @entity6 - bound passenger jet , according to federal officials , including the president and his homeland security chief			1
homeland security secretary @entity10 told @entity0 's " @entity13 " on monday that officials would review how anti-terrorist watch lists are maintained			1
@entity14 , who is accused of trying to blow up a flight carrying 300 passengers , was on a general list that contained 550,000 other names , but he was still allowed to travel to the @entity6			0
a senior administration official said the suspect was not on a no - fly list because " the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no - fly list			2
" " under the existing protocols , it requires an interagency process and the identification of other negative information that 's credible ... and that process whittles down from 500,000 [ names ] or so that are on the generic list to the fewer than 5,000 that are on the no - fly list , " @entity26 said			2
" we are going to be looking at that process and how those lists are created , maintained , updated , exchanged and the like , because clearly this individual should not have been able to board this plane carrying that material			2
" @entity14 is accused of trying to blow up a @entity44 flight from @entity45 , @entity46 , to @entity47 , @entity48 , on christmas day			0
officials say he carried an explosive device that contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate , an explosive also known as @entity52			0
part of the device , which failed to detonate , was sewn into his underwear , a law enforcement official said monday			0
president @entity58 , in his first public comment since the incident , said monday that screening and security procedures for all flights were immediately enhanced , including an increase in the number of air marshals on international flights			1
the federal system for tracking potential terrorism suspects will be reviewed because the latest incident showed that it had possible failings , the president said			0
all screening policies , technologies and procedures for air travel will be reviewed " to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks , " @entity58 said			1
a @entity82 official who asked not to be identified said sunday that the ranks of the air marshals have been increased by cutting vacations and leave , and by pulling in marshals from instructional and administrative posts			1
on @entity0 's " @entity88 " sunday , @entity26 said air marshals are assigned randomly to flights			1
current and former marshals contacted by @entity0 took exception to @entity26 's claims , saying that although there is an element of randomness to increase unpredictability , the assignments of air marshals are largely based on intelligence and an analysis of which flights are most vulnerable or most attractive to terrorists			1
despite a possible tragedy , @entity26 said the response system worked , as passengers and crew avoided panic and subdued the suspect while authorities notified other flights in the air of the situation and kept the air transport system operating			2
" once the incident happened , we were able to immediately notify the 128 flights in the air , as well as airports on the ground domestically , internationally , our law enforcement partners , other allies , institute immediate safe procedures to make sure that this could not happen on other flights and that people were watching out for it on other flights , even as we focused on what went wrong prior to this one , " @entity26 added monday			1
the @entity132 invoked a " one hour rule " after the thwarted attack , which prohibited passengers on international @entity6 - bound flights from leaving their seats during the last hour of a flight , sources said			0
in addition , passengers had to stow pillows and blankets , and maps viewed on in - flight entertainment screens were disabled during the final hour of flight			0
the @entity132 has modified the rule , however , giving airlines and crews discretion over implementation , sources said			0
@entity0 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
