-- for " @entity3 's " series finale on sunday , fans received a wedding , a funeral , and ... an infomercial starring @entity7 and @entity8 ? even after seven seasons , " @entity3 " kept fans guessing right on through to the end			1
whether the show 's fans appreciated those twists is another story			1
for some , the ending was all they could 've asked for after sticking by the show for seven seasons			0
for others , " @entity3 's " conclusion just might rank up there with the worst finales of all time			1
one of the big surprises was the death of a major -- and we mean major -- character			1
yes , the demise of @entity30 ( @entity31 ) and @entity32 ( @entity33 ) were shocking to viewers earlier in the season , but they were secondary characters			1
if you were told before the final season that @entity40 's @entity39 would n't make it out alive , would you have believed it ? granted , the show has been building up to @entity39 's death the last few episodes , but it still seemed like something that would n't actually happen			1
most were convinced that in typical " @entity3 " fashion , writers would pull out a twist in the final act and he would end up living			1
but surprisingly , they had the guts to actually go through with it			0
while @entity58 's ( @entity57 ) feelings for @entity59 have definitely flip - flopped throughout the series , there was no doubting who had her heart last night			1
all she wanted was for her one true love to live			0
but @entity39 's mind was made up			2
he knew they would n't be able to stay away from one another , and he wanted @entity58 to have the life he felt she deserved -- one with a family , something a vampire can not give her			2
( being dead and all makes it kind of difficult to reproduce			0
) his martyrdom and his speech were romantic , but then he asked @entity58 , while she stood there crying over his impending death , to do the actual killing			2
annoyed fans had one word for his choice : selfish			2
yet before @entity39 could say his parting words , " @entity3 " took an unexpected detour and threw a human - vampire wedding			1
baby - vamp @entity85 ( @entity87 ) and @entity88 ( @entity89 ) decided to get married			0
@entity85 and @entity88 are one couple that fans have rooted for , and while the gesture was sweet -- it allowed @entity39 to walk @entity85 down the aisle before his untimely death -- it was still a bit of a rush , and took away from the main event			1
as one impatient fan put it , " this is cute and all but are we really wasting valuable time on @entity102 ? ! " that question became all the more pointed upon the realization that @entity108 ' @entity107 did n't even get one line of dialogue in the finale			2
we knew he got his happy ending with @entity114 ( @entity115 ) , but could n't we get just one sassy comeback from him before the credits rolled ? apparently , there just was n't enough time , not with @entity58 donning a black dress to meet @entity39 at the graveyard for his funeral			2
@entity57 and @entity123 gave stellar performances as they said their final goodbyes to one another ( although the two actors get to stay happily married to one another in real life )			2
and then , after a time jump of roughly four years after @entity39 's death , the town of @entity130 became a much brighter place			1
@entity134 ( @entity135 ) ended up with @entity136 ( @entity137 ) , and a loving father to three young children			0
it probably was n't what you would expect from the promiscuous ladies ' man we met back in season 1 , but seeing him bonding with his children was adorable			2
these couples looked positively peaceful too : @entity85 and @entity88 , @entity150 and @entity151 ( @entity149 ) , @entity153 ( @entity152 ) and vampire @entity154 ( @entity155 ) , plus @entity156 ( @entity157 ) and @entity158 ( @entity159 ) with two kids now			0
as for @entity58 , she got her happy ending			0
viewers never learn the identity of the man @entity58 settled down with , but she ends the series pregnant and presumably in love			2
and with that , @entity167 closed the coffin on " @entity3			1
" " i do n't know if i loved that ending or hated that ending ... maybe a little of both ? " one viewer tweeted amid the chorus of responses , many of which were disappointed			0
" wow @entity3 series finale was horrible , " another fan said			1
" i ca n't believe how much i loved that show in the beginning and how far it fell			0
" " may be the only fan who loved the finale , " chimed in one grateful viewer			0
" thanks # trueblood for 7 great seasons			0
" the only plot point that seemed to escape viewers ' criticism involved @entity189 's @entity7 and @entity190 's @entity8			1
as suspected , the pair did n't keep the @entity192 cure a secret from the public , and instead started @entity195 , a cure and replacement for @entity198			0
their infomercial was definitely a series highlight			0
" @entity7 and @entity8 need a spinoff show , " tweeted one fan , as another called for a " new season of # @entity3 called # @entity205 and it 's the adventures or lives of @entity7 and @entity8			1
" whether or not the show lost steam during its seven - year run is irrelevant now			0
those who stuck with the series until the end have endured each hardship and tragedy alongside the characters themselves			0
the finale was appropriately titled " thank you			0
" so thank you , " @entity3 , " for taking viewers on an unforgettable , bloody ride , and staying true until the very end .			1

@entity167 's " @entity3 " aired its final episode sunday
fans were n't *thrilled* with the conclusion , which involved a major death
at the very least , writers kept viewers guessing until the very end
