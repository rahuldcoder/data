-- would you give up a six - figure salary to become a school teacher ? that 's what 42 - year @entity5 did			1
the @entity8 graduate was leading a team of 20 people toward the end of his 15 - year executive marketing career , while managing a $ 15 million budget and various responsibilities with @entity15 in october he left that career behind and is now found in the classroom working toward a teaching degree and a master 's in political science			1
he says he hopes to teach high school social studies and political science at the community college level			0
he is paying for his education with his savings and hopes to be teaching by fall of 2012 at the latest			0
@entity5 , who lives in @entity28 , @entity29 , said climbing the corporate ladder was n't fulfilling			0
he decided that teaching was his true calling			0
" i 'm much happier being out of the corporate environment , which i found to be frustrating and political , " he said			0
@entity36 says his work - life balance was completely out of balance and he typically found himself working on the weekends and felt tied to his phone 24 hours a day			1
" it was hard to have boundaries because you 'd hear the ' bing ' of a new e-mail and you just had to look at the message , " he said			0
his wife had been in advertising and marketing and made the switch to teaching 10 years ago			1
she was very supportive of his decision to seek a happier work life , he said			0
" i think that made a big difference			0
otherwise you could be consumed by guilt that you 're doing something to make yourself happy while asking others in your household to sacrifice , " he said			0
and while 1 in 10 @entity62 is unemployed , those who do have jobs are finding themselves increasingly miserable at work			1
fewer than half of @entity62 workers ( 45 percent ) are satisfied with their jobs , the lowest level since record - keeping began 22 years ago for @entity69 , according to a survey released earlier this month			1
@entity5 said making the decision to switch careers was n't easy			0
" part of your identity gets wrapped up in what you do , it becomes part of who you are , and to shed that skin , so to speak , is hard , " he said			0
" however , my experience was that money could buy security , but not happiness , and we spend too much time at our jobs not to take the risk and try something new			1
" @entity36 and his wife do n't have kids , have saved a lot for retirement and were in a comfortable financial position for him to make a career move -- a luxury that many families do n't have			2
so how can someone less financially stable than @entity36 safely succeed at switching careers ? certified career coach @entity100 says it 's not impossible , but it might take longer than @entity36 to make the change			1
she suggests creating a financial transition plan and thinking creatively about how to make your move			0
as part of that plan , ask these questions : could you find a part - time job to support yourself while you 're working toward your dream job ? could you try to gain experience in the field you want by volunteering outside of your current job or doing freelance work ? can you go to school at night or on weekends to develop new skills ? @entity119 says you need to develop a practical way and time frame to carry out your plan so you do n't create added stress by stretching yourself too thin financially			1
she once found herself in a similar position where she wanted to switch careers and did it by using a " bridge " job to get her there			2
" i took a four - day - a - week job that paid a little less than my previous position , and started my career coaching practice on the side , after hours , " she noted			1
" two years later , i left the old job and starting coaching full time -- and have been coaching ever since			2
" in addition to creating a plan , @entity119 says you should make sure you really want to make a change and that your dissatisfaction " is n't just a passing phase			0
" she says , " many people think they need a dramatic change because they 're so unhappy , but more often than not , they do n't need as dramatic a change as they think			2
" sometimes you can make adjustments at your current job , find another position within your company or find something that 's related to what you 're doing , @entity119 says			2
secret to success networking with professionals in the field you want to be a part of is one of the most successful ways to land a job , said the career coach			1
" i had a former client reach out to me last week who said that talking with people is the best way to realize all the options , " she said			2
the biggest mistake people make is letting fear and negative thinking stand in the way of obtaining a goal , said @entity119			2
" i actually think more people do n't pursue their dream and give up on it than people trying to make it happen and failing , " she noted			1
@entity36 says he found a quote he believes is appropriate to the topic of switching careers -- " we more often regret those things we did n't do , than those things we did			0
" and so far , the former marketing executive says , he does not regret walking away from his career to pursue his passion .			1
