-- with cups of tea and cucumber sandwiches at the ready , the @entity1 has launched itself into the international sporting arena -- with the formation of the new @entity7			1
organizers hope the team will take on challengers from the @entity11 and other faiths , while inspiring legions of believers and cricket fans around the world			1
the refreshments were the backdrop to tuesday 's announcement of the club 's formation by the @entity22 , with a little help from @entity24			1
@entity25 , @entity24 's ambassador to the @entity1 , has been a driving force behind bringing a game that he acknowledges is baffling to many to the @entity1			1
" they were wondering what this ' cricket ' is , as to whether it 's a game , or an insect or both , " he joked in an interview for @entity34			0
" but can i say that there was fairly ready recognition of the fact that there is a very prominent position by this sport in the @entity44 ... ( and ) in the @entity46 - speaking world , and that there are many priests and seminarians in @entity50 who have played cricket and want to play cricket			2
many in @entity50 would like to see their newly fledged team play the @entity11 , @entity25 said			2
he anticipates discussions soon aimed at arranging a match between the two sides in @entity46 -- a game that could prompt a rivalry not seen since the @entity11 split from the @entity60 nearly 500 years ago			2
fans will no doubt hope that game is played at @entity63 in @entity64 , known as the home of cricket			0
members of the new club are expected to play in the yellow and white @entity1 colors , with the keys of @entity7 as their emblem			1
and both sides may end up praying for divine intervention if the umpire does n't call in their favor			0
@entity25 also sees the @entity1 club as having a wider reach			2
" cricket as a sport is something that covers many , many religions and ethnic groups ... the @entity1 could play the @entity86 , they could play the @entity87 , they could play the @entity88 , " he told @entity34			1
" internationally one would have a team that represented the @entity1 , the @entity1 , that was drawn from @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity24 , @entity46 , @entity96 , @entity97 and the @entity98 -- what an international team that would be			1
" and it would obviously generate a lot of interest with the faithful who are both faithful to the church and faithful to cricket in various areas of the world			0
" some students have already been warming up with a series of matches in @entity50 , @entity25 said			0
but the wider program is not expected to come into play until next year , when the club hopes to have a team ready for international sporting events			1
and it 's not just the priests who can get in on the sporting action			0
the organizers are also looking for nuns who may have wielded a cricket bat in the past to join a women 's xi , or team			0
" they are looking for @entity125 , @entity93 and @entity94 sisters who have played cricket , and if they are found , they certainly will be invited to join the cricket club , " said @entity25			0
" there 's certainly no intention not to have a women 's cricket team at the @entity1			2
" @entity0 's @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
