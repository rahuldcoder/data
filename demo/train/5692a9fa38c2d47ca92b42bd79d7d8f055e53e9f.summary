-- two @entity2 rovers are about 5,200 miles apart on the surface of @entity4 and will likely never meet			1
but though they roam alone , @entity5 and @entity6 continue to reveal details about the @entity4 's former habitable conditions			1
new studies in the journal @entity11 describe insights from each of those rovers about ancient environments where microorganisms could have once lived			1
" these results demonstrate that early @entity4 was habitable , but this does not mean that @entity4 was inhabited , " writes @entity17 , lead scientist on the @entity5 mission , in an introduction to the studies in the journal @entity11			1
we 've been hearing a lot about how the two - ton , car - sized @entity5 has been finding evidence that @entity4 may have hosted life at some point			1
last year @entity2 came out and said that yes , @entity4 was once habitable			1
the new research reinforces that statement from @entity5 's vantage point , and adds the perspective of the @entity6 , which has found a different ancient habitable environment on another part of the planet			1
opportunity is smaller -- weighing 384 pounds , and about 5 feet in both length and height -- and older , having landed january 25 , 2004 , at a place called @entity39			1
it has driven just under 25 miles in a decade , and is currently situated in a place called @entity42			0
what opportunity has found opportunity does not have the tools required to detect carbon or nitrogen -- chemicals required for life -- directly			1
but it has been able to find smectite clay minerals -- which form in the presence of water -- in rocks on the rim of @entity42 , with supporting evidence from the @entity57 orbiting above			2
mystery rock spotted on @entity4 scientists directed @entity6 to a place on the crater rim where the orbiter suggested these clays could be found			1
there , @entity6 uncovered evidence of rocks that preexisted the formation of the crater			1
scientists believe the crater 's rim formed more than 3.7 billion years ago			0
" these are rocks that were happy on the surface , and along comes the asteroid or the comet that formed @entity42 , and the rocks were uplifted on the rim , and then the ejecta was plopped right on top of them , " said @entity72 , lead study author and planetary scientist with the rover missions			2
the ancient rocks are called the @entity86 formation			0
they are fine - grained , layered rocks with dark veneers that are carrying iron clays that suggest water with a neutral to only slightly acidic ph was once in the area			2
opportunity showed scientists fractures across these ancient rocks they wanted to explore			2
the rover 's rock - abrasion tool allowed scientists to uncover an aluminous clay that could be formed in only mildly acidic , and non-oxidizing waters			1
" whether or not life got started and evolved in that particular niche , in this groundwater percolating through the fractures , remains to be seen , " @entity72 said			2
but in a younger rock formation called the @entity107 formation , which largely filled in the crater , the rover found evidence of a more acidic and very oxidizing environment			0
this suggests that the environment was less hospitable after the formation of @entity42			0
curious findings @entity5 , on the other hand , landed in @entity116 , and helped scientists determine that an area called @entity119 was habitable in ancient times			0
here , from the rim of the crater came stream waters that formed " a lake - stream - groundwater system that might have existed for millions of years , " @entity17 wrote			0
his other car is on @entity4 smectite clay minerals there indicate there was a moderate to neutral ph , and the lack of sulfate minerals suggest also that there was not an acidic environment , @entity17 wrote			1
this ancient habitable environment seems completely different from what @entity6 found at the @entity86 formation on @entity42 , @entity72 said			2
@entity119 is probably younger , and definitely a sedimentary environment			0
all this suggests three distinct periods in @entity4 history , @entity72 said			2
in the first , in the early days , lots of water flowed on the surface , with lakes and groundwater flowing through , as represented by the @entity86 formation that @entity6 found and the mudstone in @entity119 that @entity5 found			2
one theory is that these warm , wet surface conditions took place in early times , when the planet 's iron - nickel core was still at least partially molten , @entity72 said			0
the molten core provided a magnetic field around it that shielded the atmosphere , scientists believe			0
the @entity107 formation , as examined by @entity6 , represents a later period -- likely , a drying out of @entity4 -- with more acidic , oxidizing waters			1
volcanic activity was probably dying down , and the magnetic field waning			0
lake beds were turned into sand dunes			0
" then the whole system shut off , " @entity72 said			0
the planet became what we see today : @entity170 and dry			0
curiosity is equipped to find organic molecules , but finding them may be difficult			0
assuming such molecules were enriched , and not destroyed when sediment turned into rock , they would have also needed to survive ionizing radiation			0
another new study in @entity11 describes the radiation environment on @entity4 , and suggests that , in theory , organics could have been preserved from millions of years ago -- but the indication of them might be much weaker now			2
what 's next for the rovers the @entity5 , representing a $ 2.5 billion mission , is now on its way to @entity188 , a sedimentary formation that will allow the rover to explore @entity4 ' history by driving up the peak 's slope and exploring rock chemical composition layer by layer			1
@entity2 is planning to launch another curiosity - sized rover in 2020 , which could collect samples that later missions might return to @entity199			1
opportunity will continue exploring @entity42 , moving southward to see if there are more of these ancient rocks from a more livable time			0
but @entity6 's twin , spirit , is n't going anywhere			1
spirit also landed in january 2004 , on the opposite side of the planet , and got stuck in the soft soil of a place called @entity212			1
that location turned out to be a scientific gold mine			0
spirit showed evidence that water , possibly in the form of snow melt , had trickled into the subsurface relatively recently , and continuously			0
spirit has been defunct since it stopped communicating in 2010			2
the other rovers are too far away from it to pay their respects			0
objective of 2020 mission to @entity4 : signs of life , @entity2 says follow @entity229 on @entity230 at @ lizlandau			1

the twin spirit and opportunity rovers landed on @entity4 in january 2004
spirit lost communication with @entity199 in 2010 , but @entity6 is still sending data
studies describe insights about past life - supporting environments
the curiosity rover followed in *august* 2012
