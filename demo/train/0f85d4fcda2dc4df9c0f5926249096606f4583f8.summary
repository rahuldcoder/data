-- the fate of @entity2 -- the @entity4 , @entity5 , police officer who killed @entity6 -- is heading to a jury			1
but it may not be what you think			0
for the first time wednesday -- after 11 days of often emotional , sometimes violent protests demanding " justice " in the form of formal charges against @entity2 -- his case could move to court			1
yet , in stark contrast to the media frenzy on the streets of @entity4 in the aftermath of @entity6 's death , cameras wo n't be allowed into the courtroom			1
as activists stress the need for transparency , these proceedings will be secret			2
here are a few things to know about how the grand jury system should work as it pertains to this case and others in @entity5			1
is the grand jury the only way that a person can be charged with a crime ? no. in fact , it 's not the way most people are charged with crimes			1
it 's used by prosecutors only in a small percentage of cases			0
authorities can file a criminal complaint , which could then lead to a probable cause hearing in court			2
such a proceeding is open to the public and media			0
that 's not the case with a grand jury proceeding			1
so it 's closed to the public ? yes			0
and that does n't sit well with @entity6 's family			2
" it 's about transparency , " family lawyer @entity60 told @entity0			0
" this community has a distrust for the local enforcement officials			0
so if you have a secret grand jury proceeding , where nobody knows what the prosecutor presents ... and the grand jury comes back and says we find this ( shooting ) justified , i think that 's going to be very problematic for this community to accept			1
" still , while they might not like it , the @entity6 camp 's opposition to the secretive grand jury process wo n't open it up			1
this may be convenient for @entity82 prosecuting attorney @entity81 given the intense public pressure on the case , said veteran criminal defense lawyer @entity85			2
" he 's already , i think , kind of punted this over to the grand jury , " said @entity85 , a @entity0 legal analyst			1
" so that ( if ) they do n't bring an indictment , he can say ' well , it 's out of my hands			0
' the members of the community said that there is no crime here			0
" how is a grand jury picked ? just like any other jury			1
citizens get a summons in the mail telling them to come to court			0
if they make the cut , they are on a grand jury			1
in this case , the jurors will come from @entity82 , @entity5			1
how many people are on a grand jury ? in @entity5 , it 's 12 people			1
( the number might be different in other cases			0
) does their decision have to be unanimous for a charge to be filed ? no. it 's true that , in a criminal trial , all jurors must agree to convict someone on a given charge			2
but in @entity5 only nine jurors -- or three - fourths of the grand jury -- have to agree			1
so what are the grand jurors deciding ? according to the @entity5 state attorney general 's office , a grand jury is looking at two things			1
one , was a crime committed ? two , is there probable cause that the accused -- in this case officer @entity2 -- committed the crime			1
it is very significant that this is a lower standard than for a criminal trial			0
in that case , jurors must decide if someone is guilty of a crime " beyond a reasonable doubt			2
" " probable cause " is n't as stringent			2
is the process overseen by a judge ? no. as @entity145 , a criminal defense lawyer and general counsel for the @entity147 police officer association explains , it 's just the grand jurors , the prosecutors and the witnesses			1
that means no judge or defense lawyers			1
" the prosecutor simply presents the information that they have , " @entity145 explains			0
does that mean the accused ca n't present a defense ? yes and no. first off , unlike during a regular trial , defense lawyers ca n't rebut the prosecution or cross-examine a witness			1
it 's the prosecutors who present their case , without interruption			2
that does n't mean that the voice of the accused is n't heard			0
as the attorney general notes , " defendants do not attend unless they are testifying as witnesses			0
" since @entity2 witnessed what happened on august 9 as much , if not better , than anyone else alive , he might be invited to testify in court			2
" usually an accused will not be invited to testify , " @entity145 told @entity0			0
" but i would expect , in a case like this , that an invitation would be extended to him			0
" what will the prosecution present to the grand jury ? in a word , everything			1
just take @entity81 's word for it , according to the @entity188 : " absolutely everything will be presented to the grand jury			1
every scrap of paper that we have			0
every photograph that was taken			0
" will @entity81 himself present the case ? @entity197 , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office , told the @entity200 that the prosecution will be " handled by the attorney regularly assigned to the grand jury			1
it will not be by mr. @entity81			0
" so how long will this process take ? a grand jury could indict some one as early as tomorrow			2
but that does n't mean it 's going to happen that fast			0
in fact , it could be weeks or months			0
after all , @entity212 attorney general @entity211 has said the @entity213 -- conducting a parallel federal civil rights investigation into this case -- has interviewed hundreds of potential witnesses			0
there 's no reason to believe local authorities have n't similarly conducted lots of interviews and collected various pieces of evidence to sort through and present to the grand jury			2
doing so should take some time			0
5 things to know about the shooting complete coverage of @entity4 shooting and protests @entity0 's @entity230 contributed to this report .			2

a grand jury could soon start considering the case of @entity2
the @entity4 , @entity5 , police officer fatally shot @entity6 , 18
grand jury proceedings are secret , with no judge or defense lawyers
9 of 12 grand jurors must agree on probable cause to press charges
