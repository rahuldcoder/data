for @entity7 , " made in @entity5 " is not a seasonal trend or marketing slogan meant to evoke classic workwear looks or to drive sales of limited edition brand collaborations			1
it 's simply the way @entity10 and @entity11 's father has done business since 1970 in @entity13 , @entity14			2
it has not always been easy			0
@entity16 resisted the urge to outsource production overseas even as clients disappeared and margins shrunk			0
in the 1990s they started making bags for other labels to stay afloat			0
as the @entity24 tell it , staying in @entity14 was the only way to ensure survival , by standing out for maintaining quality control of their products			0
but will consumers see it that way beyond next season ? how can brands like @entity16 that are in it for the long haul convince the @entity39 generation that one of their leather satchels is worth the triple - digit investment ? @entity44 pondered this sentiment aloud to a group of people gathered in a @entity49 showroom on a rainy saturday night in december for a panel discussion on the future of @entity5 apparel manufacturing			1
his family business trains and employs skilled leather craftsmen , paying them a living wage to make quality bags and accessories , he said			2
" in order to keep that going we ca n't let it be a trend , " he told the group of entrepreneurs , small - business owners and fashion enthusiasts			1
" how do we keep it going without it being a trend ? " the question comes at a time when shopping small and local are attractive buzzwords for a generation of consumers that claims to be disillusioned with corporate @entity5			1
whether they 'll pony up the extra cash for a handbag whose makers claim will last longer than their fast - fashion equivalents is another matter — a reality that the @entity24 and other business owners in attendance seemed to be aware of			1
the discussion occurred during a pop - up market called @entity83 , which features @entity5 - made goods with a contemporary feel			1
the first @entity83 launched in 2010 as a menswear market in @entity87 , expanding to other cities amid growing demand for classic looks inspired by @entity5 heritage brands			1
people travel hundreds of miles for the markets , which tend to attract style - conscious men ( and women ) willing to pay a premium for waxed cotton jackets , selvedge jeans or @entity101 cloth shirts made in the @entity5			1
@entity83 is one of several new markets trying to reach this consumer , building on the success of its predecessor , the @entity107 , which has also expanded to new cities worldwide since its first show in 2009 in @entity110			1
december 's @entity83 was the first to exclusively feature @entity5 - made products for women in an attempt to reach a demographic historically known to favor fast fashion over high - dollar investment pieces from new or emerging brands			1
the brands ( and price tags ) at @entity83 's markets for men and women are not for everyone , said market co-founder @entity122			1
they 're trying to reach consumers searching for quality in an item , shoppers " who appreciate the details and bigger picture when buying an item , " she said			1
" there will always be the people who buy a shirt at @entity134 that 's made fast and costs less than a shirt made in the @entity5 by a smaller brand , " she said			1
" i 'm hoping the quality shopper wins out in the long run			0
" the @entity140 boom in menswear has led to greater demand for tomboy - inspired looks for women the past few seasons			2
so - called " boyfriend " - style button - up shirts and jeans are mainstays in stores like @entity152 and @entity153 , and just about everyone from @entity155 and @entity156 to @entity157 has incorporated elements of casual and formal menswear into their runway looks			0
menswear 's influence was apparent in many of the brands at @entity83 , not by coincidence			1
@entity166 , founder of @entity168 - based brand esby , said working in menswear inspired her to start her own line for women			1
" i was really envious of how classic menswear was , but it was not cut for my body , " she said			0
" i felt like there was a market for quality womenswear because i could n't find it when i was looking for it			0
" with the help of @entity181 , she launched her first line in february with the goal of using quality fabrics , even if they ca n't be found in the @entity5			1
all the fabrics she uses in her collections are imported except for the knitted canvas of some shirts			0
the sewing and pattern - making happens in @entity192 before items are shipped to a wash house in @entity195 and back to @entity168 to be sold or shipped			0
" staying in the @entity5 was always the plan , " she said			1
" i want to be hands - on and i ca n't fly out of the country for each season to oversee production			0
" for some , made in @entity5 is a lifestyle choice , said panelist @entity202 , founder of style blog " @entity204			2
" it has crossover appeal to those who identify as conscious consumers and claim to care about where their clothes come from			0
these shoppers consider the " made in @entity5 " label synonymous with fair labor practices and supporting small businesses			1
" made in @entity5 is about knowing the people behind product , " she said			2
" it 's a lifestyle , it 's being part of a bigger cause			0
" the past few years have seen the launch of a handful of e-retailers and online - first brands dedicated to supply chain transparency and knowing your brand			2
information about provenance , materials and brand story are prominent features on new sites such as @entity233 , @entity234 , and of a kind			1
not all brands featured on of a @entity204 — which showcases limited runs of goods from emerging designers — manufacture in the @entity5 , said @entity241			2
but each brand is vetted so of a kind can provide customers with an honest answer			0
" our customers want transparency about where things come from			0
that matters more to them than whether it 's made in the @entity5 , " she said			2
besides , she said , everything made in @entity5 is not created equally , just like all " made in @entity257 " merchandise is n't the same			2
" it 's about finding brands you trust , " @entity241 said			0
people in the audience said they would love to support these brands if they could afford them			0
by the end of the discussion , educating consumers had emerged as one way to sell them on the value of the goods			0
that 's why markets like @entity83 exist , @entity270 said : so consumers can meet designers in person			1
" the biggest issue , which we are always thinking about , is how much it costs , " she said			0
" i 'm hoping that the way organic and local food prices have come down a little , the items we sell at @entity83 can become more attainable to the masses			2
" when you are paying for normal and fair wages for a person , the price of the item goes up			0
here 's hoping demand brings it down eventually			0

small , @entity5 - based clothing makers are eager to attract consumers *accustomed* to " fast fashion " but wanting more
pop - up markets like @entity83 bring together small - business owners and *conscientious* shoppers
information about provenance , materials and brand story are prominent features on shopping sites tailored to these consumers
