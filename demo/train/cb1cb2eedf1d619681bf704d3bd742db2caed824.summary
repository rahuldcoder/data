there are two @entity1 : the first one i might not agree with , but the second one truly scares me			0
" @entity8 " pushes for less government regulation for corporations and shrinking the federal government			2
you may or may not agree with these positions , but they are both mainstream conservative fare			0
then there 's " @entity14			0
" this @entity8 wants to impose conservative @entity16 law upon @entity17			1
am i being hyperbolic or overly dramatic with this statement ? i wish i were , but i 'm not			0
plainly put , @entity8 wants to convert our current legal system into one that requires our laws to be in agreement with religious law , not unlike what the @entity26 want to do in @entity28			1
@entity8 is not hiding this			2
the only reason you may not be aware of it is because up until his recent surge in the polls , the media were ignoring him			0
however , " @entity14 " was out there telling anyone who would listen			0
he told a crowd at a november campaign stop in @entity40 in no uncertain terms , " our civil laws have to comport with a higher law : @entity46 's law			2
" on @entity49 at an @entity40 candidates ' forum , he reiterated : " we have civil laws , but our civil laws have to comport with the higher law			2
" yes , that means exactly what you think it does : @entity8 believes that each and every one of our government 's laws must match @entity46 's law , warning that " as long as there is a discordance between the two , there will be agitation			1
" i 'm not exactly sure what " agitation " means in this context , but i think it 's a code word for something much worse than acid reflux			0
and as an aside , when @entity8 says " @entity46 , " he means " not any god ( but ) the @entity46 , @entity71 and @entity72			2
" so , if your god differs from @entity8 's , your god 's views will be ignored , just like the father is on " @entity78			2
" some of you might be asking : how far will " @entity14 " take this ? it 's not like he 's going to base public policy decisions on @entity83 passages , right ? well , here 's what @entity8 had to say just last week when asked about his opposition to gay marriage : " we have judeo - christian values that are based on biblical truth			1
... and those truths do n't change just because people 's attitudes may change			0
" @entity8 could not be more unambiguous : his policy decisions will be based on " biblical truths , " and as he noted , these " truths " will not change regardless of whether public opinion has evolved since the time the @entity83 was written thousands of years ago			2
imagine if either of the two @entity99 members of @entity100 declared their support for a proposed @entity17 law based on verses from the @entity104			1
the outcry would be deafening , especially from people like @entity8			2
one of the great ironies is that @entity8 has been a leader in sounding alarm bells that @entity109 want to impose @entity109 law -- called @entity112 law -- upon non-muslims in @entity17			1
while @entity8 fails to offer even a scintilla of credible evidence to support this claim , he continually warns about the " creeping " influence of @entity99 law			1
@entity8 's fundamental problem with @entity112 law is that it 's " not just a religious code			1
it is also a governmental code			0
it happens to be both religious in nature and origin , but it is a civil code			0
" consequently , under the @entity112 system , the civil laws of the land must comport with @entity46 's law			1
now , where did i hear about someone wanting to impose only laws that agree with @entity46 's law in @entity17 ? so , what type of nation might the @entity17 be under @entity8 's @entity112 law ? 1			1
rape victims would be forced to give birth to the rapist 's child			1
@entity8 has stated that his religious beliefs dictate that life begins at conception , and as a result , rape victims would be sentenced to carrying the child of the rapist for nine months			1
gay marriages would be annulled			1
@entity8 recently declared that not only does he oppose gay marriages , but he supports a federal constitutional amendment that would ban them , invalidating all previous gay marriages that have legally been sanctioned by states and thus callously destroying marriages and thrusting families into chaos			1
@entity8 would ban all federal funding for birth control and would not oppose any state that wanted to pass laws making birth control illegal			1
no porn ! i 'm not kidding			0
@entity8 signed " @entity169 " pledge ( @entity166 ) authored by the @entity167 organization , under which he swears to oppose pornography			0
i think many would agree that alone should disqualify him from being president			0
to me , " @entity14 " truly poses an existential threat to the separation of church and state , one of the bedrock principles of our nation since its inception			0
not only did @entity179 speak of the need to create " a wall of separation between church and state , " so did @entity8 's idol , @entity185 , who succinctly stated , " @entity183 are , and must remain , separate			0
" while there may be millions of @entity17 who in their heart agree with the views of " @entity191 , " it is my hope they will reject any attempts to move @entity17 closer to a becoming the @entity28 of the @entity195 .			0

@entity197 : @entity8 would like to impose @entity16 law on @entity17
he says @entity8 has *repeatedly* said he thinks civil law should reflect @entity16 law
he says candidate would annul gay marriages , compel rape victims to give birth
@entity197 : how does this differ from @entity112 law @entity8 warns about , denounces ?
