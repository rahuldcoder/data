@entity1 -- " @entity3 " bandleader @entity0 is a walking @entity4 -- and now he 's added his own story to the mix. @entity0 has been @entity8 's bandleader for 27 years			1
@entity0 's new memoir , " we 'll be here for the rest of our lives : a @entity21 " ( @entity22 ) offers his take on a colorful career , from piano lessons in his native @entity16 to a " @entity20 " stint to the gig he 's had , and relished , for 27 years -- @entity8 's sidekick			1
oh yeah , and he co-wrote the hit disco song " it 's @entity25			2
" @entity0 appeared this week at a @entity27 @entity26 to sign books and give a performance			1
among those who dropped by were the @entity32 ' @entity31 -- who joined in for " @entity33 " -- @entity34 and girl group belter @entity35			0
@entity0 also took questions from the audience			1
though the topic of @entity8 's recent troubles was off - limits , one audience member did ask @entity0 what the host was really like -- emphasis on " really			1
" @entity0 responded that the boss he 's respected and admired for nearly three decades is " very transparent on the air and you can see exactly what he 's like			1
" @entity0 talked to @entity2 about how he picks songs to introduce guests , his renowned @entity53 celebrations and his chance to be on " @entity55			1
" the following is an edited version of the interview : @entity2 : when guests are introduced on the " @entity3 , " you usually add a musical accompaniment that 's an obscure reference to their name			2
my favorite was when @entity65 was a guest , and you played " @entity67			0
" can you tell me how you come up with those , and what some of your favorites have been ? @entity0 : we think of them in rehearsal before the show			1
i have about 15 minutes , and i often throw it open to the floor			0
and by the floor , i mean the musicians , the band [ the " @entity3 's " @entity81 members ]			2
and i say " who has an idea for this ? " and i pick the one that i like the best			0
[ once we ] had a new actor named @entity88 , and one of the guys in the band says , " i 'm sorry " [ referring to the @entity93 song ]			0
so we did it , and it cracked @entity8 [ @entity8 ] up so i know that i got my one laugh -- and the most important laugh			1
@entity2 : what 's the story behind using @entity100 ' " busted " for @entity101 ? @entity0 : he was particularly difficult to come up with something for because he 's on all the time , and we did n't want to play a news theme or a song about the news			1
so @entity107 , my bass player , suggested " busted " ... " i 'm broke , aw -- i 'm busted			0
" and @entity101 asked about it once : " why do you play @entity100 ' ' busted ' when i come on ? " he asked on camera , and i said , " i 'm broke -- aw -- i 'm busted			2
" @entity2 : what is your favorite song of all time ? @entity0 : as far as favorite " overall package " record of all time , i 'd have to say " my girl " by @entity116			1
i like everything about it , not only the composition -- but the arrangement , the production , the lead vocals , the background vocals , the horns , the strings			0
that one i listen to over and over again			0
and , of course , " @entity127 " by the @entity129			0
maybe that 's my favorite song , and " my girl " is my favorite record			2
@entity2 : for some reason i thought it was " he 's a rebel " by the @entity136			2
@entity0 : well that 's way up there			1
i consider that my national anthem			0
when i hear " he 's a rebel , " i stand			2
@entity2 : are there any musicians you regret never having had a chance to work with ? @entity0 : well , of course , @entity145 [ @entity146 ] is one , and @entity148 is the other			1
but aside from those two i think i 've done pretty well			0
@entity2 : can you tell me a little bit about your famed " @entity151 " ? @entity0 : we spent a lot of time at the show during the early days of " snl " [ " @entity20 " ]			1
we had no personal lives at all			0
... and , of course , we were there doing a show around @entity53 time , and @entity161 , who was one of the writers , came up with the idea that we should have a seder for the cast and crew and writers who would n't be going home			0
so i said , " i can conduct it ! " i knew how to conduct a seder at lightning speed because my parents could n't wait to get to the matzo ball soup			0
so i have that skill , and i also sort of had an act , too			0
as a prize for finding the matzo , i gave out a pizza on [ " snl 's " ] " @entity180			2
" [ producer ] @entity181 liked it so much that he had matches printed up immediately that said " @entity0 's @entity184 " and that became legendary			1
@entity2 : in the late 1980s , you were offered the role of @entity188 on " seinfeld			2
" any regrets on not accepting that part ? @entity0 : just to be clear , i was offered the role of @entity55 's sidekick			1
he had three sidekicks , and i had a feeling mine might 've been that role			0
and any regrets ? well , i mean it was only the most beloved show of all time			0
... truthfully , though , i would have missed the opportunity to play music			0
@entity2 : how do you stay hip and current in a world where today 's kids do n't appreciate showbiz legends and the origins of comedy ? @entity0 : i still talk incessantly about " @entity210 , " and i say , " screw the kids ! "			1

@entity0 : the @entity8 viewers see on air is who he really is
@entity0 's new memoir has stories of " @entity20 , " @entity8
@entity0 was offered chance to play @entity55 sidekick at one point
bandleader legendary for his " @entity151 "
