-- a big @entity2 could have really clubbed @entity3 , but fortunately for the denizens of that @entity6 territory , @entity1 never gained much clout			1
the tropical storm dumped plenty of rain and forged through the @entity16 island with gale - force winds saturday afternoon , but according to the @entity18 , @entity2 barely qualified as a tropical cyclone , with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph , as dry air and vertical shear tore the storm apart			1
despite the lack of an impressive resume , @entity2 made things miserable for at least tens of thousands of @entity3			1
nearly 40,000 people , mostly in the mountainous center of @entity3 , lost electricity , and another 3,000 were left without fresh water , gov. @entity23 said at a news conference			1
@entity29 also said 220 " refugees , " from several different countries , including the @entity6 , ended up in shelters in @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			2
the storm was heading over the eastern @entity37 , which was subject to a tropical storm warning , according the @entity18 's 8 p.m. advisory			1
the @entity41 - based center noted that @entity2 was centered about 60 miles east - northeast of @entity42 , @entity37 , and 200 miles southeast of @entity43			1
as of 8 p.m. tropical storm warnings also remained in effect for the southeastern @entity46 , and the @entity47			0
@entity2 could end up dumping 1 to 3 inches of rain " with isolated amounts up to 5 inches " throughout the @entity16 by the time it 's passed through			2
the @entity18 suggests three possible scenarios for @entity2			2
the official forecast is that " @entity2 survives its current lack of structure , land interaction , and dry air entrainment long enough to reach a more favorable environment in about 36 hours			0
at that point , it would likely intensify until the onset of extratropical transition in 96 - 120 hours , " and become a hurricane far out in the @entity63			0
the second scenario calls for @entity2 to degenerate over @entity65 , though it could regenerate later			0
and the third scenario would involve a low pressure system developing over the northwestern @entity46 absorbing @entity2 in the next 48 hours or so			0
the biggest threat to the @entity6 would be rip currents up and down the @entity70 as large waves come ashore			0
