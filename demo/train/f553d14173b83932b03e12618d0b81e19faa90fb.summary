president @entity0 has sent a letter to @entity3 requesting a resolution that will grant him authority to use military force against @entity7			1
in an effort to placate opponents of military intervention in both parties , the administration has hedged the request by including language that restricts " enduring offensive ground forces " and limits any intervention to three years			1
he sent a letter with the request promising @entity3 that he would not authorize " long - term , large scale ground combat operations " as occurred in @entity19 or @entity20			1
with that language , he then does ask for authorization to use ground troops			2
there is no reason not to take @entity0 at his word with what would be the first authorization for the use of force since 2002 when president @entity32 requested this to conduct strikes against @entity19			1
@entity0 has usually been hesitant to use large - scale force unless it is absolutely necessary to protect the nation 's interest , and he has shown a clear preference for other methods of combatting terrorism -- from the use of targeted drone air wars to diplomatic initiatives			1
@entity0 , who came into office railing against @entity32 's use of wars in @entity20 and @entity19 , both of which he has drawn down , is not eager to jump into another major conflict			1
yet the history of these kinds of resolutions should give @entity3 pause			1
for a start , lawmakers will have to be extraordinarily vigilant in how they word the resolution and make very clear the kind of limits that they want to impose , and to live by			1
the reality is that even when presidents have promised to use limited force , the nature of foreign conflict has a logic of its own			1
pressure can escalate to support intervention			2
within the @entity72 , the dynamics of politics can drive both parties toward a more hawkish stand , relying on the most liberal interpretation of the war powers that had formally been granted			0
" what does it mean , " asked sen. @entity77 , @entity78 , about the term " enduring offensive ground operations ? how long , how big is ' enduring ' ? ' offensive ' , what 's ' offensive ' when it comes to the @entity86 ? " we have seen this dynamic repeatedly in recent @entity72 history			0
most famously , we saw @entity91 approach @entity3 in august 1964 to request a resolution authorizing the use of force in response to alleged communist attacks against @entity98 ships in the @entity99			1
back then , @entity91 sent word to members , through sen. @entity102 of @entity103 , that he only wanted power to deal with this specific incident			0
@entity102 told fellow senators that if @entity91 wanted to do anything bigger he would return to @entity108 to request their support			2
that 's not how the war unfolded			0
just as @entity112 had seen with the conflict in @entity114 , @entity91 kept steadily escalating the military presence in a conflict that would consume his presidency			2
and while there were a number of legislators who stood up against the war , warning that it was a mistake and threatening to use budgetary power to stop the president , the conflict proved extraordinarily difficult to control			1
indeed , far more legislators gave their support to the operation once it had started			0
proponents of the war in both parties did a good job of isolating opponents of the war as dangerous , unpatriotic radicals who were not willing to support the fight against communism			0
the strength of the @entity136 and the @entity137 , meanwhile , constantly created pressure to intensify the conflict			0
the same dynamics were at work even when presidents did exercise restraint			0
in 1991 , president @entity144 asked for support to employ force to remove @entity148 's @entity19 forces from @entity149			1
in that case , in the short term , the elder @entity32 lived up to his word and ended the mission once it was complete			0
the problem was that the dynamics of the region created ongoing pressure for military intervention			2
once the @entity72 had formally announced that @entity148 was a threat , it was difficult to ignore the continued provocations , and when @entity148 continued to violate @entity164 resolutions , there was ongoing pressure to employ force			2
the continued presence of troops in the region after @entity170 , meanwhile , triggered intense animosity that helped fuel the creation and spread of @entity174			0
after 9/11 , president @entity32 sought war power to combat the forces that had been responsible for the horrendous attacks			2
initially , this was the focus			0
@entity180 passed a resolution in 2001 granting @entity32 sweeping wartime powers , a resolution that @entity0 's current request would leave in place even if many critics have argued that it has been used far too liberally			1
in 2002 , @entity32 built on this to seek a resolution using force against @entity19			2
similarly congressional - approved counterterrorism surveillance programs would be used in the same fashion			0
while it 's not always the case , wars can often get bigger and bigger -- so - called mission creep			0
if @entity3 is not extraordinarily careful with how it crafts the resolution , initial authority can quickly become the basis for ongoing , large - scale and prolonged intervention -- far beyond what legislators originally intended			1
all this means that when the president sends such a request to @entity3 , legislators in both parties should take seriously their responsibility to ensure that the language is as tight as possible and that their intentions are clear			1
they should also use this moment to revisit the 2001 authorization			0
and once they have done all this ? that 's when the toughest part begins			0
because that is when @entity3 will have to live by its initial word and push back against any efforts to expand the mission in ways that go beyond the scope of the authorization			1
that will be much easier said than done .			0
