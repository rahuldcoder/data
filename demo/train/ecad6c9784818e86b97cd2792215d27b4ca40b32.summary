@entity0 , @entity1 -- in @entity0 's wholesale fashion headquarters , where textile merchants follow in the legacy of fathers and grandfathers , many @entity1 are looking for the latest in tech fashion : the @entity9			1
mobile phone store @entity10 in @entity0 carries iphones among other cell phones and products			2
it 's at @entity14 that consumers shop for the latest models of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			0
the local mobile phone chain even carries the @entity21 and @entity23 models of the highly coveted @entity9			1
one customer asks the clerk whether the store sells the @entity9			2
but when he hears the price , the customer walks off in disappointment			0
@entity10 sells the @entity30 for about 2,600 nis , or about u.s. $ 753			1
the current market price in the @entity33 is $ 399			0
the store clerk says the store pays a 50 percent tax to import iphones from outside the country			0
but the price does n't hinder @entity9 's popularity here , appealing mostly to young men quick to upgrade their @entity21 to a @entity23 model as if memory size is a barometer of male bravado			2
@entity46 has yet to make its presence official in @entity1			1
the company has limited its @entity9 products to four markets : the @entity33 , the @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			2
still , as in other parts of the world , the @entity9 has strong reception along @entity58 shores			2
the coveted phones make their way through customs in both official and unofficial passages ; consumers buy them abroad for friends and acquaintances to resell on the gray market			2
but before the phone can work on a local network , it must be unlocked or " jailbroken , " tech lingo for reprogramming the @entity9 to work on network carriers not affiliated with @entity46			1
@entity46 maintains strategic deals with several hand - picked wireless carriers ; namely @entity75 in the @entity33			2
in order to protect these alliances , @entity46 issues this disclaimer to customers planning to reprogram the @entity9 : unlock at your own risk			1
the standard one - year warranty on jailbroken @entity37 is null and void			0
at @entity10 , unlocking the @entity9 is big business , and @entity86 's services are in high demand			1
for 100 @entity31 ( about u.s. $ 30 ) , @entity86 , a @entity88 immigrant , will unlock an iphone in about 20 minutes , replacing the factory - provided sim card with the customer 's sim of choice			1
for an extra 50 @entity31 ( about u.s. $ 15 ) , he 'll change the language program to @entity96			1
@entity86 , who maintains a growing collection of unused @entity75 sim cards , said he unlocks an average of 30 to 40 iphones a week			0
@entity86 has no formal technical background ; he said he learned the technique through various sources			0
" in the beginning , it was n't simple ; now it is simple , " he said with a smirk			0
last year , as many as 1 million @entity37 may have been unlocked and activated by carriers not paying @entity46 a kickback , according to industry experts			2
@entity111 , a businessman and developer based in @entity113 , @entity114 , said his @entity9 is a " valuable business tool " that he uses on international trips , notably to @entity1 , where he 'll pop out his @entity33 sim and replace it with one that will run on a local network			1
@entity111 said he paid $ 20 to a friend of a friend to unlock his phone so he can stay with his current phone carrier , @entity123			0
when he purchased the @entity9 from an @entity46 retail store in @entity113 , he made it clear he was n't planning to sign on with @entity75			1
" they told me that they would n't sell me the phone if they knew i was going to unlock it , " @entity111 said			0
determined , @entity111 told the salesperson that he had the right to buy the merchandise and that the store could not control it			0
how did the @entity46 salesperson respond ? " to tell me he 'll pretend like he did n't hear it , " said @entity111			0
@entity46 representatives declined to comment on the unlocking phenomenon and @entity37 making their way overseas , referring @entity2 to a @entity142 article that quoted @entity46 chief operating officer @entity143 speaking at the @entity144 in february			1
@entity143 described the unlocked iphones floating around the world as " a good problem to have , " according to @entity142 , preferring to focus on @entity46 's 10 million quota -- even if it means doing away with its carrier exclusivity			1
" the demand for the @entity9 is so intense in the markets where we are n't offering it that people are exporting it out of the @entity33 in many different ways and then running it on local carriers , " @entity143 said			1
" of all the problems we face , this is the one i face looking at with a little bit of a smile			0
because it means there 's great demand for the phone			0
and to have people stepping over each other to have the phone is n't a bad thing , " @entity143 said .			0
