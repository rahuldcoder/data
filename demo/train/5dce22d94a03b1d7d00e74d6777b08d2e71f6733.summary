in a closely watched vote , @entity1 lawmakers approved a proposal to make recreational marijuana legal for adults and to regulate its production , distribution and sale			1
once it 's signed by president @entity9 , who initiated the proposal , @entity1 will be the first nation in the world to fully legalize the drug			1
in the year and a half since president @entity14 announced the proposal in june 2012 as part of a comprehensive package aimed at fighting crime and public insecurity , a strong coalition of @entity21 , women 's rights , health , student , environmental and human rights organizations joined forces with trade unions , doctors , musicians , lawyers , athletes , writers , actors and academics under the banner of @entity37 ( @entity38 ) to support the initiative and created a lively public campaign in favor of the proposal			1
under the proposal , people will have four ways to access marijuana : medical marijuana through the @entity46 , domestic cultivation of up to six plants , membership clubs similar to those found in @entity51 and licensed sale to adults in pharmacies			0
the bill was approved in the @entity56 in late july and passed in the @entity57 on tuesday			0
why marijuana , why now and why @entity1 ? the following three simple reasons have a lot to do with today 's outcome : because it 's the smart thing to do			1
doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results is insanity , and @entity1 knows this			2
for 40 years , marijuana prohibition simply has n't worked			1
billions of dollars have been spent on repression , but marijuana use has only gone up -- along with the number of lives lost to failed policies			2
the tens of thousands who have died in @entity75 's drug war -- estimates in 2012 ranged from 60,000 to 70,000 over six years -- @entity77 's globally high homicide rates and the @entity78 ' racially driven mass incarceration are but a few examples of the human cost of the war on drugs			0
but rather than closing their eyes to the continuing problem of drug abuse and drug trafficking , @entity1 's leaders have chosen responsible regulation of an existing reality			1
because the winds are changing , and they 're starting to blow in that direction			0
in recent years , debate and political will for an overhaul in drug policy has gained unprecedented momentum throughout the @entity78 , @entity98 and elsewhere			0
in 2011 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 joined former presidents @entity102 of @entity103 , @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity75 and other distinguished members of the @entity108 in saying the time had come to " break the taboo " on exploring alternatives to the failed war on drugs and to " encourage experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs , " especially marijuana			2
more recently , presidents @entity120 in @entity105 and @entity121 in @entity122 have joined these calls for reform			0
in may , the @entity125 produced a report , commissioned by heads of state of the region , that included marijuana legalization as a likely policy alternative for the coming years			0
in november 2012 , the states of @entity132 and @entity133 approved the legal regulation of marijuana			2
in august , the @entity136 announced that the federal government will not interfere with state marijuana laws -- as long as a number of stipulations are adhered to , such as preventing distribution to minors			0
by approving this measure , @entity1 has taken the broad regional discussion on alternatives to drug prohibition one step further , representing a concrete advance in line with growing anti-drug war rhetoric in @entity98 and throughout the world			1
because @entity1 is used to doing exceptional things			2
you might hear " @entity1 " and think of football , yerba mate , beef , tango or , now , marijuana			2
but this tiny country of just over 3 million people has a history of remarkable political reforms and a strong human rights ethos			1
just last year , @entity1 legalized same - sex marriage and abortion			0
it has long been at the forefront of progressive policies , being one of the first nations in the region to grant divorce rights for women in 1912 , instituting the eight - hour workday in 1915 and including women 's right to vote in its @entity175 in 1917			0
it has never criminalized prostitution and has legally regulated it since 2002			0
in 2009 , @entity1 granted adoption rights for same - sex couples and the legal right to choose one 's own gender identity			1
this also comes from a country where the church and state have been officially separated since 1917			0
it 's a country where the president , 78 - year - old former @entity188 guerrilla @entity14 , lives an austere lifestyle after having spent 14 years as a political prisoner during @entity1 's dictatorship , 10 of them in solitary confinement			1
he donates 90 % of his salary to charity , shuns the presidential palace and chooses instead to remain on his farm with his wife , also a former political prisoner , working to construct a more fair , more inclusive @entity1			2
marijuana prohibition has n't worked , and it 's time to try an innovative , more compassionate and smarter approach			1
let 's hope more countries soon follow @entity1 's brave lead			1
join us on @entity210 / @entity209 .			0

in @entity1 , a proposal supported across the *social* *spectrum* to make pot legal has passed
@entity216 : @entity1 knows prohibition has n't worked and wastes lives and dollars
@entity216 : @entity1 's leaders chose regulation of an existing reality , which also fights crime
@entity216 : the world should take a lesson from this tiny country with a history of political reform
