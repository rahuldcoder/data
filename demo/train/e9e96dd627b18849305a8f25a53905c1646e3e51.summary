@entity0 just wanted to sell some pizza			2
an electrician - turned - entrepreneur , he knew his upstart pizza parlor needed a kick			2
so @entity0 came up with the idea of using bikes to bring his customers their margarita , za'atar and mince pies			2
" we had to adapt , " he said			2
it 's not just about coming up with business innovations or delivery options			2
thinking outside the box becomes a necessity when you 're essentially living in boxes like @entity0 and more than 83,000 others like him , who fled their homes in war - ravaged @entity22 and settled across the border in northern @entity27 's @entity26 refugee camp			1
the camp began in july 2012 as a small patch of tents for scared and worn @entity22			1
as the refugees ' numbers grew , their perspectives changed			1
the civil war in their homeland was n't going away anytime soon , and neither were they			1
so these resilient @entity22 went to work			0
for men like @entity0 , who , like other refugees , prefers not to be identified by his full name , there was n't much choice but to adjust to their new lives , new livelihoods and new ways of doing things			1
" i could n't sit and wait for the situation to change , " said @entity0			1
" we always want more for our families			0
" interactive map : @entity22 turn @entity26 into a home they 've gotten it			0
@entity0 's business is booming , with up to 50 deliveries a day to humanitarian workers , government officials and fellow refugees			1
and in many ways , @entity60 -- their new home -- is thriving as well			1
almost anything is better than what they left behind			0
@entity22 's civil war has been raging since 2011 , when a government crackdown on protests in @entity70 spiraled into a full - blown armed conflict			0
few areas have been spared by gunfire , bombing , airstrikes , even reported chemical attacks			0
the violence comes not just from troops loyal to president @entity79 -- who has been criticized and isolated by much of the world -- but a number of rebel groups , some of them considered moderates and others extremists , like the @entity88 affiliate @entity87 and @entity89			0
the impact on civilians has been horrific			0
@entity92 , the @entity93 special envoy for @entity22 , reported in january that some 220,000 people had been killed and 1 million wounded			1
some 7.6 million have been displaced because of the fighting , with the return of polio , typhoid and measles to @entity22 symptomatic of the health crisis there			0
the war has also produced 3.3 million refugees , most of whom ended up in camps in @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity27			1
at least in @entity26 -- which , within its packed 1.3 square miles , is already one of the world 's largest refugee camps and ranks as @entity27 's fourth largest city , according to the @entity93 -- refugees have taken matters into their own hands by transforming their new home			1
" they realized they were going to be in @entity27 longer than they first thought , " @entity93 refugee agency official @entity117 said			1
" ( they ) could not sit around and do nothing			2
" for proof of what they 've done , look no farther than the @entity126			0
no , not the iconic boulevard in @entity128 , though the common name is a nod to that street and a reflection of @entity22 ' sense of humor			0
that 's also the name of the @entity138 's now vibrant main drag			0
it 's lined by mobile phone shops , mini markets , welding shops , barbers , fruit and vegetable stalls -- just about anything you can think of			0
this @entity126 is a place where @entity22 can make a little money , get what they need and , perhaps , restore some of their hope for the future			0
while non-governmental organizations and the @entity93 are active in @entity154 , and their employees even do some shopping there themselves , the more than 2,000 stores and such are made and run by refugees			1
business is so brisk that a new road , @entity161 , has popped up to accommodate new ventures			0
@entity163 estimates the @entity22 refugees there generate approximately $ 10 million dollars a month in revenues			2
this does n't necessarily make up for the larger strain that refugees have had on @entity27 's economy , with an april 2014 @entity172 report calling the overall impact " negative			1
" still , that same report also said , " increased consumption brought about by a sizable influx of @entity22 refugees has contributed positively to economic activity			2
" and any economic activity is a plus for the @entity22 refugees , two - thirds of whom live below the national poverty line and one in six who live in abject poverty , according to the @entity93			1
that 's why @entity22 like @entity0 and humanitarian officials like @entity163 are pleased with what 's happening in @entity154			0
while its residents ' lives have been far from happy or normal of late , the refugee camp -- more and more -- is becoming just that			1
as @entity117 said , " it is like any downtown , in any city , in the world			0

more than 83,000 people live in the @entity60 refugee camp in northern @entity27 , @entity93 says
the refugees have set up and run more than 2,000 businesses in the *crowded* camp
" i could n't sit and wait for the situation to change , " says one entrepreneurial refugee
