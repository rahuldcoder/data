-- would you like to let @entity2 know when your @entity3 has dropped a call ? well , now there is an app for that			1
@entity2 on monday released a new application called " @entity9 , " which lets @entity3 users submit complaints about dropped calls , poor service coverage , and less - than - perfect voice quality			1
the application is free and available in the @entity16			0
it uses gps technology in the @entity19 and the @entity20 to pin point where the user is when experiencing the problems			1
for first generation iphones , it uses cell tower - triangulation to get a fix on problem areas			0
once the application is launched , users have several complaint options			0
they will see a screen that has buttons that let them report a dropped call , poor voice quality , or poor service coverage			2
@entity2 spokesman @entity38 said @entity2 plans to use the data collected to identify trends and prioritize the company 's network investments			1
" we think this is a great way to get customer feedback to improve our network , " @entity38 said			0
" we are always looking for ways to make it easy for customers to share their experiences			0
and this app lets customers report issues			1
it logs the time and location and automatically forwards the information to our network planning team			0
" @entity3 owners have been complaining about @entity2 's network since the @entity3 went on sale in the summer of 2007			1
complaints mounted after the 3g version of the phone was released a year later in 2008			0
and as more @entity3 users come onto the network , more people , particularly in densely populated urban areas , such as @entity69 and @entity70 , have experienced problems with dropped calls and congested data networks			1
@entity2 executives have not said that @entity2 has a problem with its network			1
but executives , such as @entity2 chief technology officer @entity78 , have said that the company has seen a surge in data traffic attributed to @entity3 users , who typically consume more wireless bandwidth than other @entity2 wireless customers			1
@entity2 has been upgrading its network to keep up with demand			2
and @entity2 's network recently got a poor ranking in terms of customer satisfaction in a @entity91 survey			1
@entity92 , @entity2 's chief rival , has taken advantage of @entity2 's struggles with a series of advertisements that point out @entity2 's lack of @entity86 coverage in certain parts of the country			1
@entity92 is running advertisements that mock the @entity105 " there 's an app for that , " catch phrase with one that says , " there 's a map for that			2
" @entity2 fired back with a lawsuit and an advertisements of its own featuring actor @entity114 , who points out @entity2 's strengths while taking a few shots at @entity92			2
@entity2 recently dropped its lawsuit against @entity92			2
and @entity92 , which had been suing @entity2 over claims that it has the fastest 3g wireless network , also dropped its lawsuit against @entity2			2
@entity38 said that the new " @entity9 " application was not prompted by the bad publicity around its network issues nor was it prompted by the current ad wars going on between @entity2 and @entity92			2
instead , he said that the application was simply a part of @entity2 's ongoing commitment to listening to customers			1
" we are always looking at ways to get customer feedback in as timely a manner as possible , " he said			0
" that 's why we pay attention to @entity134 , @entity135 and blog			0
one of the great values of these social networking tools is that it 's a great way to get instant feedback			0
and it helps us identify problems			0
" the " @entity9 " application can be downloaded onto all iphones running version 3.0 or later of @entity105 's operating system or it can be access using @entity148 and synchronized to the @entity3 via a pc or @entity150 @entity38 said that @entity2 is testing the " @entity9 " app for other devices			1
and he said @entity2 hopes to offer applications on other smartphones in the future			0
no date has been announced yet			0
and @entity38 did n't specify which devices might get the new application , but considering that @entity2 sells a lot of @entity163 's @entity162 devices , it 's likely it will create an application for that device			2
the app could be offered through @entity2 's own application storefront or through @entity163 's @entity168			1
