-- the price of silverware just got a whole lot more expensive			2
but can $ 134 million and the royal seal of approval of the @entity6 , @entity6 , bring the coveted @entity7 back to @entity9 shores for the first time in history ? " this is about righting a wrong , " said @entity12 , the most successful @entity13 sailor of all time , as he revealed the @entity9 team he hopes will defeat billionaire @entity18 's reigning @entity17 champions			1
" we 've never won it			2
we have a huge maritime history			0
we have to bring this thing home			0
" in the 163 year history of the race , @entity9 has never won the prestigious silver trophy			1
adding insult to injury , the first competition took place on its shores in 1851			0
will the " @entity7 , " as it is affectionately known , finally return to its birthplace in the next edition of the race in 2017 ? thanks to that hefty budget -- partly spent on designing high - tech boats capable of slicing through the water at 95 kilometers per hour -- @entity9 's challenge is not to be taken lightly			1
@entity42 glamor to the bid was provided by the @entity6 , who joined @entity45 on the manicured lawns of @entity48 's @entity47 for the official launch on a sweltering summer morning			1
a keen sailor herself , the @entity50 went head - to - head against her husband @entity54 in a yacht race during their recent tour of @entity57 and @entity58 -- emerging victorious 2 - 0			2
it 's hoped she 'll not only pass on some of that winning spirit to @entity45 's team , but also add the type of international lustre so attractive to the world 's richest investors			0
money matters around 40 % of the $ 134 million budget has already been raised , with @entity45 and his board now on the hunt for big commercial sponsorship			2
it 's a huge investment -- and one they 're touting as the advertising chance of a lifetime			2
" if you could be the brand that brings the @entity7 back to @entity9 , i think that 's a phenomenally powerful thing to be associated with , " said @entity76 , chairman of the racing team and co-founder of @entity9 phone retailer @entity79			1
" we certainly would n't say it has to be a @entity9 company , " he added			1
" but i think it needs to be someone who has business interests and is supportive of @entity9			1
" @entity18 's @entity89 the team will need deep pockets to be a serious contender against reigning champions @entity93 -- owned by tech billionaire @entity18 , the fifth wealthiest person in the world according to @entity95			1
@entity45 is under no illusions about the challenges ahead			0
he was part of @entity18 's 2013 winning team , helping them to a thrilling comeback against @entity102			0
" standing on that podium it did cross my mind that this would be more satisfying with a @entity9 team , " said 37 - year - old @entity45			1
" this is n't @entity18 's budget , so we have to be very focused with the money we have , " he said , adding that the multimillion dollar pot would go towards design , logistics , and a world class crew			0
and if anyone is up to the mammoth task of taking on @entity18 , it 's got to be @entity45			0
" they say @entity45 has the @entity120 -- i 'm not sure about that , but i have seen him time and time again achieve the impossible , " said @entity13 gold medalist and @entity0 's @entity123 presenter @entity121			0
" that said , he 's also no stranger to the monetary might of @entity18 and what that can achieve			0
" daring design this is not a competition based on brute strength alone , and part of @entity9 's success will come down to the clever design of their vessel			2
gone are the days of heavy yachts with single hulls and white billowing sails			0
today 's multihulls are like airplanes on water , sitting high above the waves , with crew members wearing wetsuits , carry oxygen tanks , and communicating via radio			2
combined with advancements in tv coverage -- thrilling angles , graphics and on board cameras -- last year 's @entity7 coverage breathed new life into a notoriously unfriendly spectator sport			1
" finally here was a format the public seemed to absolutely love , " said @entity76			0
" people who had never talked about sailing before , never had any interest in it , suddenly became absolutely captivated by the @entity7			1
" @entity9 's best bet ? of the six crew members revealed , four hail from @entity9 and two from @entity58 -- including three times @entity7 winner @entity167			1
the @entity169 was quick to point out that @entity45 was " the type of bloke who always gets in the first round of beers , " and you get the feeling this is n't just an assemblage of world class athletes , but close friends hoping to make history together			0
" i remember as a kid watching these amazing boats racing , " said @entity45 , who grew up in @entity181 , on @entity183 's picturesque south west coast			0
" it 's just something that hit me , and i had this burning ambition and desire to be part of the @entity7 team -- and ultimately part of the winning @entity195 team			1
" how true that turns out to be , we 'll soon find out			0
