@entity2 former @entity1 gov. @entity0 said on sunday he will release 250,000 emails from his two terms in office and write an @entity7 outlining his governing philosophy			1
the moves have set the political sphere atwitter with speculation he 's closer than ever to deciding to run for president in 2016			1
in what appears to be a move of classic political procedure -- getting ahead of the opposition -- @entity0 told @entity17 that his intention is to promote transparency			2
" part of serving or running both of them is about transparency , " he said			0
" i 'll let people make up their minds			0
" further evidence a presidential run might be looming is a report in the @entity28 that @entity0 recently lost 15 pounds , per an unnamed source			1
@entity0 also admitted it 's been " kind of fun " to go back and look back at previous campaigns to remind himself that it 's possible to " move the needle " if you run with big ideas			1
" that 's what you need right now in @entity45 , " said the brother of former president @entity39 and son of former president @entity41			0
by controlling the release of the emails and writing a book to accompany them , @entity0 has the opportunity to frame potential controversial subjects , like his support of the @entity54 education policy and immigration reform			1
well aware he holds some positions out of step with the conservative wing of his party , @entity0 admits , " i am who i 've been			2
" an @entity7 , too , is noteworthy for @entity0 , who has n't run for office since 2002 -- before the invention of the @entity63			2
the release of a digital product might serve as a flag that the former governor is prepared to build a modernized , digital campaign			2
" i was digital before digital was cool i guess , " @entity69 joked about emailing			0
" now it 's commonplace			0
" the book comes as @entity0 's finances -- including overseas investment and his work for venture capital firms -- have come under scrutiny			0
the released emails could cast light on an already controversial narrative beginning to form or , more likely , serve as a timely distraction			0
@entity0 says he is going to make up his mind about running in " short order , " and he plans to release the emails " sometime early next year			1
