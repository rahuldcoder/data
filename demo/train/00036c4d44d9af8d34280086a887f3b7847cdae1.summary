-- the @entity1 operates an air base in @entity3			1
the keystone of the @entity7 's @entity6 , it keeps essential mat√©riel moving into @entity9 for @entity11 troops , notwithstanding steady disruption on the roads out of @entity14			2
@entity15 , which insists that @entity3 is in its " sphere of influence " and claims a special right to protect ethnic @entity15 living there , has its own air base only a few miles away from the one used by the @entity1			1
in theory , both of these installations serve the mutual security interests of @entity3 and its great power allies			1
in theory , the bases demonstrate shared security interests between @entity15 , the @entity1 and @entity3			1
today @entity3 faces the most severe crisis of its history -- and the @entity1 and @entity15 should act together to help alleviate it			1
perhaps as many as 2,000 of @entity3 's citizens have perished in acts of unspeakable terrorist depravity and violence			1
perhaps a half million have suddenly lost their homes and possessions			2
@entity3 's government lit an urgent beacon calling on its allies for help			1
it had fair expectations of getting it			0
@entity44 , after all , reminded @entity1 that a good neighbor comes rushing when the house next door is on fire -- so how would a neighbor respond if he actually occupies a room in that burning house ? but so far @entity1 and @entity15 have offered little beyond token gestures			1
when president @entity54 and @entity15 president @entity55 hold their summit this week in @entity58 , the situation in @entity3 will certainly figure on their agenda			1
will they offer the world leadership in resolving it ? over the last week , acts of horrendous violence occurred in and around the 2,000 - year - old city of @entity66 in southern @entity3			1
the acts were methodical and clearly well planned			0
they involved waves of assault by attackers wearing military and police uniforms , operating armored personnel carriers and other military equipment , followed by gangs of young toughs armed with clubs , rifles and knives			0
video : refugees say @entity3 troops shot at civilians the attackers killed without hesitation or remorse , looted entire neighborhoods , and torched what could not be carted off			1
because in many cases the attackers appeared to be ethnic @entity3 and the victims ethnic @entity93 , many observers were quick to characterize these events as acts of ethnic violence between groups with a long history of mutual animosity			1
but scholars with depth in the region warned against these characterizations			0
" i do n't believe in a narrative of long - simmering ethnic tension , " said @entity105 's @entity104			0
in an appearance on @entity112 's " @entity111 , " the @entity109 's @entity108 made a similar point , cautioning against the " ethnic tension " narrative and noting that " there 's a really strong political component to this			0
" @entity118 and @entity108 are correct			0
there were interethnic clashes in 1990 , in the waning days of the @entity121 , but even then the circumstances were suspicious			0
the pogroms that began in @entity66 a week ago reflect careful coordination and organization			0
the major question is : who is behind this ? the interim government in @entity130 lays a charge at the feet of the deposed dictator , @entity133 , who hails from the @entity134 and still has support there			0
moreover , many of the police and military leaders in this region were appointed by @entity133 and do not appear to be particularly loyal to the new government			0
the government 's charges are credible , but it 's likely that the initial waves of violence also provided cover for score - settling , and it seems that criminal elements , particularly narcotics traffickers , have exploited the situation with zeal			2
here are some points on which @entity55 and @entity54 should be able to agree : restraint : at present both @entity93 and @entity3 armed groups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted			1
rape and crimes involving sexual violence have been a particularly worrying aspect of the troubles			2
a strong appeal for restraint and respect for the security measures imposed by the @entity3 government should be issued			1
protecting civilians at risk : at least 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes , according to the @entity173 high commissioner for refugees			1
in many cases the homes have been incinerated with all their possessions , leaving them nothing to return to			2
protecting those who have lost their homes and loved ones from further acts of violence must be a top priority			1
security must be established at their camps ; bedding , sanitary facilities , food and medical care must be arranged urgently			0
humanitarian security / policing operation : because thousands of people have been traumatized after being attacked by people they greeted as policemen or soldiers , heightening anxiety along an ethnic fault line , outsiders can provide an important measure of confidence			2
international monitors can patrol with the local police and army , and international security can protect those delivering humanitarian assistance			2
but further steps may be necessary if the local security arrangements collapse and another plea for foreign troops is issued			0
an investigation : the best way to avoid a repetition of the events of last week is to make clear that those who committed acts of murder , looting , rape and arson will be identified and punished for what they did			0
a broad , credible , independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and their origin , led by a person of international prominence with prosecutorial experience and a mandate to establish the facts and lay the foundation for criminal prosecutions of the perpetrators			0
reconstruction : the devastation in central @entity66 and in numerous villages is reported to be near total			0
the international community , under @entity1 and @entity15 leadership , should provide generous support to jumpstart the reconstruction process , prioritizing its assistance to those most directly injured by the violence			1
elections : @entity3 's dictator was toppled by a violent uprising in april			2
the country still has no democratically elected government			0
establishing a legitimate elected government is therefore essential to restoring stability			0
the international community should mobilize observers to help assure that the elections are fair and free			0
special efforts need to be made to insure that those who lost their homes and property in the violence are able to fully participate in these elections			2
@entity54 and @entity55 have taken laudable steps to reshape the @entity15 - @entity1 relationship , systematically eliminating points of conflict and developing new points of cooperation			1
but the crisis in @entity66 invites them to show joint leadership , providing examples for the entire world community about how to address a humanitarian crisis on the territory of an allied state			1
the lives of hundreds of thousands depend upon it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity3 violence has claimed many lives , forced many from their homes
@entity287 , @entity288 say @entity1 , @entity15 have done little in response
they say the two nations have *responsibility* to help ease the suffering
coordinated action could end the humanitarian crisis , they say
