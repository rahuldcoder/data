deftly takes the popular tabletop miniatures game and puts it into a video game with gun - blazing , sword - swinging action and a story that flows well			1
players control @entity10 , a captain of the @entity11 , as they and their comrades attempt to battle orks , demons and the forces of @entity16			1
there are plenty of weapons to satisfy your melee or missile tendencies in battle			1
all the action takes place in the third - person point of view , so the field of battle is easily kept in sight at all times			1
minor enemies attack en masse and in waves , while tougher enemies usually show up to scrap all alone			2
boss battles are demanding , and pulling off multiple attacks is almost required to conquer the last foe			2
players often are accompanied by two other space marines who contribute to the wholesale slaughter of lesser opponents but seem to have little effect on boss battles			1
hand - to - hand weapons can be knives , swords , axes and hammers while long - distance weapons start with pistols and go all the way to cannons			1
ammunition and grenades can be found strewn around the battlefield to supply whatever weapons you have in your possession			1
modes of combat are interchangeable and offer plenty of ways to wipe out enemies			2
trigger buttons control the long - range weapons while controller buttons activate hand - to - hand abilities such as stun and execution			1
performing an execution on a stunned enemy also rewards the player with points for good health			2
hack - and - slash action makes for an enjoyable fight and really enhances the game			1
but it is more than just blood and gore ( which , incidentally , gets splashed all over your character during battle , then magically disappears afterward ) that make " @entity6 " worthy			1
the characters seem like they are ripped right from the @entity88 navy , with accents that sound like they come from the streets of @entity92			0
each character has his own feel and motivations , giving personality to even the lowliest speaking ones			0
the game 's three main space marines all have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies			0
they are outfitted in colorful armor that probably would feel right at home in a " @entity105 " setting but with nods to symbols and icons of ancient civilizations			0
i found myself listening a little more intently than normal as characters spoke about their trials and tribulations			0
small bits of soldiers ' lives were revealed , helping make the entire experience more immersive			0
the story -- one of honor , courage and sacrifice -- could have readily been ignored or glossed over to focus more on the combat			0
however , developers were able to knit together a tale that also includes loss and betrayal while giving the player a feeling of omnipotence that makes it unique for shooters			0
but the single - player campaign game felt like it did n't last long enough , and the maps , while beautiful , were linear -- not allowing for exploration			2
the panoramic views and immense weaponry teased with the prospect of a wide world to be explored and liberated , only to be stifled by rubble and downed machinery at every turn			0
the ending , a cliffhanger of sorts , really was a jaw dropper			0
it 's a testament to the writers for crafting an interesting ( but short ) story as well as the developers for making me feel so invested in my characters			0
i have never played " @entity1 " on the tabletop ( mainly because i did n't have the funds to lay out for the miniature figures that are required ) , but " @entity1 : @entity6 " on the console is well worth the investment			1
" @entity1 : @entity6 " is available for the pc , @entity158 and @entity159			1
it is rated m for mature due to blood and gore and intense violence			0
this review was done playing the single - player campaign on the @entity159 .			2

in " @entity1 : @entity6 , " players control @entity10 , a captain of the @entity11
all the action takes place in the third - person point of view
hand - to - hand weapons can be knives , swords , axes and hammers
