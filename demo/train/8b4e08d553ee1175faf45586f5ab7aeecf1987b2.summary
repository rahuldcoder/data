it 's been more than four years since the @entity2 family went missing , and nearly eight months have passed since their remains were found in the @entity5			1
who would want to kill @entity7 ; his wife , @entity9 ; and their two young kids , @entity11 , 4 , and @entity7 , 3 ? how did their bodies end up in two shallow graves some 100 miles north of their home ? investigators still have not named any suspects or persons of interest , but those involved are n't giving up			1
a new detective recently joined the investigation , bringing new energy and new ideas to the table			1
as the investigation continues , here are five questions that could provide clues about the case : 1			1
who used @entity2 's phone shortly after he disappeared ? on february 4 , 2010 , @entity33 received a phone call from @entity2			1
it was 8:28 p.m. @entity36 , @entity7 's close friend , picked up the phone , looked at it , and set it back down			1
" i had a bunch of other things i was doing , and i was just tired , " he told @entity39			1
@entity7 ran a custom water feature business , and he often bought custom indoor waterfalls from @entity36			1
@entity36 had already talked to @entity7 multiple times that day , and they had also met in person for a couple of hours			1
" i had no idea that something like this was going to happen , " said @entity36			1
was that just a regular call from his friend , or could it have been a call for help ? " there are hundreds of scenarios			1
i have gone over all of them in my head , " he added			2
" of course i regret not picking up the phone			2
" what happened to the @entity62 ? 2			2
who used @entity2 's credit card the day she disappeared ? according to phone records , @entity2 made a call from her home phone at 2:11 p.m. february 4 regarding purchasing herbal medicine			1
financial records show her credit card was used 25 minutes later at a store in @entity72 , @entity73 , about 20 minutes from her home			2
it 's not clear whether @entity9 was the one who made that purchase			2
" that is certainly a piece of evidence that we would review if there 's any video or any documentation to support who was at that store and used that credit card , " said @entity78 , sheriff of @entity79			2
" every piece of evidence in this case is critical , " he said			2
2013 : who were the @entity62 ? 3			2
did @entity2 's business have anything to do with his families ' disappearance ? in the months before his disappearance , business at @entity7 's company was good			1
so good , in fact , that @entity7 was working on a deal that could have been worth $ 9 million , his father , @entity103 , said			2
by summer of 2011 , @entity104 , who worked for @entity7 managing his company 's website , had sold the business to an outside company			2
" he owned nothing of --- any part of , any share of , anything , " he said			0
@entity104 , however , said he and @entity113 split everything 50 - 50			0
" we shared ownership from the beginning of starting the company , " he said			0
although @entity103 had his suspicions about @entity104 , @entity104 has maintained his alibi and innocence			0
" i was in @entity122 for over a month before he disappeared , " he said			0
and the evidence @entity39 has uncovered seems to indicate @entity104 was in @entity122 around the initial days of the @entity62 ' disappearance			0
why was someone using the @entity62 ' computer to research traveling to @entity128 ? one week before the @entity62 went missing , someone used their home computer to search for information on how to get children into @entity128			0
four days after they disappeared , detectives say the family 's white @entity134 was parked and subsequently towed from a parking lot just steps from the @entity128 border			1
investigators also found surveillance video showing a family of four matching the @entity62 ' description crossing on foot into @entity128 on february 8			1
" i just thought , ' well , maybe they took off , ' " said @entity7 's mother , @entity143			0
but his father was n't buying it			0
" i said right up front , the first time i saw it ( the surveillance footage ) , it was n't them , " said @entity103 , adding that @entity9 was afraid of @entity128			0
" would @entity9 take her two children in there ? @entity155 , no , " he said			0
still , investigators want to know whether the computer search and their disappearance were related			0
was crucial evidence in the @entity2 home destroyed ? eleven days after the @entity62 went missing , @entity7 's brother @entity161 called the @entity162			1
he said he waited so long because he did n't want to overreact and thought the family might just be on vacation			1
brother to killers : ' you guys are cowards ' the @entity162 immediately alerted homicide , but it took investigators four days to obtain the warrants needed to complete a full search of the home			0
during those three days , the @entity176 home was unsealed			0
the @entity62 ' friends and family had some access in and out of the house			1
@entity7 's mother straightened up the kitchen , which she says smelled terrible because of the trash			0
@entity184 said the house was not deemed a crime scene because there was no sign of forced entry			0
with investigators ' permission , he said , he grabbed his brother 's computer and sd card			0
given all of the foot traffic in the house , freelance investigative journalist @entity195 said critical evidence could have been lost			0
" certain items that might have been really key to the big mystery of why they left that house are gone , " he said .			0
