-- @entity1 : we 're losing control of our digital privacy the erosion of privacy rights under the @entity7 , written to protect us against unreasonable search and seizure , began in earnest under president @entity11			1
the @entity12 , passed overwhelmingly but hastily after 9/11 , allows the @entity13 to obtain telecommunication , financial , and credit records without a court order			2
moreover , the @entity18 's 2008 amendment act grants @entity20 companies immunity from being sued by their customers when they comply even with blatantly illegal government surveillance requests			1
as a presidential candidate in 2008 , @entity24 pledged to reform the @entity12 and rescind the @entity26 , but as president he reversed his position			2
the @entity24 administration has fought bipartisan efforts in @entity31 to bring the change he once championed			2
the result is the " new normal " : surveillance , often of questionable legality and sometimes clear illegality , against which @entity20 have little effective recourse , on the rare occasions that we even know that violations are taking place			1

she is the author of " consent of the @entity51 : the @entity52			2
" @entity53 : @entity55 's phone snooping a different kind of creepy i 'm finding it hard to get too worked up over the revelation that the @entity55 has been authorized by the secret @entity60 to collect all our call data from @entity63			1
has n't everyone already assumed this ? everything we do in the digital realm -- from surfing the web to sending an e-mail to conducting a credit card transaction to , yes , making a phone call -- creates a data trail			1
and if that trail exists , chances are someone is using it -- or will be soon enough			2

he is a media theorist and the author of the new book " @entity82 : when everything happens now			2
@entity84 : the @entity85 is a surveillance state all of us being watched , all the time , and that data being stored forever			1
this is what a surveillance state looks like , and it 's efficient beyond the wildest dreams of @entity93			1
sure , we can take measures to prevent this			2
we can limit what we search on @entity97 from our iphones , and instead use computer web browsers that allow us to delete cookies			2
we can use an alias on @entity102			2
we can turn our cell phones off and spend cash			0
but increasingly , none of it matters			0
there are simply too many ways to be tracked			0
the internet , e-mail , cell phones , web browsers , social networking sites , search engines : these have become necessities , and it 's fanciful to expect people to simply refuse to use them just because they do n't like the spying , especially since the full extent of such spying is deliberately hidden from us and there are few alternatives being marketed by companies that do n't spy			1
this is n't something the free market can fix			0
we consumers have no choice in the matter			0
all the major companies that provide us with internet services are interested in tracking us			0

" @entity135 : surveillance state no answer to terror terror attacks , plane crashes , even school shootings stick in our head out of all proportion to the danger they pose to us as individual citizens precisely because they are extraordinary			1
but remember the big picture			0
how many people do you know who have been the victims of terrorism ? on the other hand , how many people do you know who have suffered from cancer , or obesity , or gun violence ? if we 're interested in safety , public health and gun control are much more important issues than terrorism			0
they , not surveillance , should be our safety priority			1
we should honor the victims			0
we should praise the @entity171 , police and private citizens , who helped find the culprits			0
but we should also rest secure that our system of government is working			1
we should reject , like @entity177 did , any call to move further towards a police state			1

he tweets about privacy at @ neilmrichards and is the author of the recent @entity186 article , " @entity187			1
" @entity188 : @entity24 administration overreached on leak probes intelligence agencies often act on the edges of executive prerogative and move forward based on a narrow base of lawfulness and limited congressional notificationâ € ” and these are often sufficient to underpin a one - off covert action			0
but democracies do n't get to do anything repeatedly over a long period ( like drone strikes and targeted killings ) without political supportâ € ” and political support is the end point of a process that begins with informed debate			0
informed debate depends on information , the kind that most journalists seek			0
we can not make public the nation 's legitimate secrets , but @entity20 need a broad outline of what is being done on their behalf			1
ironically , the public dialogue generated by a free press may be one of the best guarantors that the @entity221 will , in the future , be able to act boldly ( and occasionally secretly ) in its own defense			0

@entity230 : do n't let drones invade our privacy when assuming office , every government official must take an oath to abide by and uphold our @entity237			1
since 2010 , i have made that my mission in @entity31			0
unfortunately , the @entity24 administration is not upholding nor abiding by the @entity237 -- in fact , this administration is going to great lengths to continually violate it			0
its most recent transgression involves the use of domestic drones			1
these small drones are to be used as a crime fighting tool for law enforcement officials			0
but is unwarranted and constant surveillance by an aerial eye of @entity253 the answer ? read more ... @entity230 , a @entity255 , is a @entity20 senator from @entity256			1
@entity257 : @entity97 knows too much about you if @entity20 -- or people anywhere -- decided to take up @entity97 's offer to check out its new policy , they would discover something so troubling , so frightening , really , that it would override the national tendency to leave companies alone to make money how they see fit			1
at least in the case of companies such as @entity97 -- and now @entity102 -- which know more about us than even our closest friends			0

@entity282 : @entity283 was good while it lasted to be a politician today is to live in some ways like a citizen of @entity287			1
a politician must assume that he or she is under 24 - hour audio - visual surveillance			1
any objectionable remark , any untoward joke , any awkward facial expression may be recorded and broadcast			0
professional and personal ruin can strike at any moment			0
if @entity300 's " macaca " moment did n't drive home the point , @entity298 's 47 % video certainly should			1

@entity316 : despite @entity102 , privacy is far from dead if you read closely the various alarmist articles about the death of privacy , you soon will note that many deal either with public spaces or with hypotheticals			2
they claim that police could abuse these tools , might use them to ill effect and so on			0
the @entity331 , for example , criticized the use of drones by law enforcement by arguing that such use " could eventually eliminate the privacy @entity20 have traditionally enjoyed in their movements and activities			2
" @entity102 has been caught in the same crossfire between strong privacy advocates and the social benefits it generates for hundred of millions who use it to communicate with their families and friends , close and not so close			2
it improved its privacy settings , though it still takes a considerable amount of effort to set them at the specific level one prefers			2
however , if @entity102 users choose to ignore the risk to their privacy when they log in to this domain , which is known for its openness , their complaints must be taken with a grain of salt			2
