-- @entity1 is a world - class whitewater kayaker			1
throughout his professional career , the 31 - year - old has braved treacherous rapids in more than 40 countries and racked up over 100 first descents â € ” successfully paddling a river 's uncharted territory			1
despite his success and the boyish good looks that landed him in @entity16 as " @entity17 " in 2008 , the down - to - earth @entity12 native has always had a greater purpose : to use his passion for the sport to help young adults with cancer			1
in the prime of his career in 2001 , @entity1 founded @entity25 , a nonprofit that provides free outdoor adventures for adults ages 18 to 39 battling the disease			1
it all started when @entity1 's aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer when he was 12 years old			1
" that was the first time cancer had become very personal to our family			1
seeing someone you love go through this disease really changes the way you view it , " he said			2
" seeing how few resources were available to her as a young adult made me realize that there was a tremendous need there			1
" so he turned to what he loves most â € ” kayaking			1
in 2001 he took 10 people on a weeklong kayaking adventure to prove to them that they could be stronger than their cancer			1
since then , the organization has expanded to 13 employees and now includes rock climbing , mountaineering and surfing			1
it has grown from one program in @entity60 to 50 programs throughout @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
" @entity66 , especially as a young adult , can really send someone into isolation , " @entity1 said			1
" they come to these programs and often for the first time since their diagnosis they meet someone else their age with cancer			1
they can have conversations about cancer that they could n't have before			1
they start to regain a lot of trust in themselves and a lot of confidence in their bodies			2
" at a surfing event in @entity91 , @entity92 , 15 young adults came together to tackle the waves			1
all the participants got nicknames so they could assume a new identity for the week â € ” one that separates them from their cancer			2
@entity100 , a mother of four nicknamed " @entity102 , " showed no fear on the water			2
but two years ago , things were much different			2
" in 2010 , i was diagnosed with breast cancer			2
... i had just had a baby , and i was diagnosed when he was 10 months old , " she said			0
" so there 's a lot of fear that was there			0
" now in remission , @entity100 , 39 , says the program has helped her gain a new perspective on life			0
" getting to be here was one of the dreams i 've had , " she said			0
" i can conquer the waves			0
i can go after dreams still			0
" @entity128 , nicknamed " @entity127 , " was diagnosed last year with stage 4 molecular lymphoma			2
she is still undergoing chemotherapy treatments and said it was a gift to have the camp to look forward to			0
even though she has a strong support system at home , the 36 - year - old is grateful for the new friends she made			2
" you just laugh at all the crazy experiences that everybody who does n't have cancer would think , ' oh how terrible ' and give you this look			2
and they feel sorry for you , " she said			0
" here there 's no pity			0
that 's been really good for me			0
" another camper , @entity149 , named " barbershop , " is undergoing treatment for stage 3 brain cancer			2
the 34 - year - old was eager to meet other young adults facing similar challenges			1
" when i found out about @entity25 , it seemed like a great opportunity to meet other people in my position and just get outside and enjoy something			1
it 's been amazing , " he said			0
on his first day on the water he set a goal to stand up on the surfboard three times			0
" the first and second , i was on my knees			0
and the third time , i finally got up , " he said			0
" they all said i came back with a huge smile on my face			0
" @entity1 , who was also at the beach , said his biggest reward is getting to spend time with the people he wants to serve			1
" the participants every day inspire me			0
every day i live differently because i 've met them , " he said			0
" you only live once , and you do n't live for long			0
these guys remind you to get after it			0
