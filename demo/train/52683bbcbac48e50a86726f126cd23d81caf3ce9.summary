-- the legend of @entity2 reaches all the way back to the moment he was born			1
unfortunately , nobody knows exactly when that was			0
@entity2 believed the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey			1
some records show that @entity2 came into the world on september 5 , 1846			1
his tombstone , however , says 1850			0
@entity12 , because his mother died in 1847			0
all of this might not normally matter , but @entity2 's birth date is important to his overall legend , which proudly proclaims him " the boy distiller			1
" so perhaps it 's best we begin when @entity2 was first introduced to whiskey , which we know was early in life			1
leaving home at a young age , @entity2 struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $ 9			1
he ended up at the home of @entity30 , a preacher at a nearby @entity32 church and the owner of a general store			0
there , @entity35 also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself			0
@entity2 quickly became determined to learn the craft			1
in fact , many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from @entity43 and began pursuing the business full - time at the ripe age of 16			0
if that legend is true , then @entity2 began selling his own @entity48 whiskey only three years later ; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce , " established and registered in 1866			1
" in reality , no documents support that myth			0
@entity2 may have been a teenage moonshiner , but he did n't register his business with the federal government until 1875			1
and by then , @entity2 would have been the more booze - appropriate age of 29			1
the maker makes his mark whatever legends exist , one thing is certain : @entity2 had a brilliant mind for marketing			1
even as a youngster , @entity2 understood that if people remembered him , they would remember his whiskey			2
to that end , he decked himself out in a formal knee - length coat , a vest , a tie , and a wide - brim planter 's hat , and was never caught out of " uniform " again			1
@entity2 also established the @entity75 -- a 10 - member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside			1
with uniforms and instruments from the @entity82 catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling , @entity2 made sure the band played every saloon opening , @entity87 celebration , and political rally around			2
but perhaps @entity2 's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey			1
from the beginning , @entity2 had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs			2
next , he upgraded to round , custom - embossed bottles			0
but when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895 , @entity2 realized he 'd stumbled upon something unique			2
the new bottles not only stood out from the crowd , but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport			0
in addition , the square look reinforced the idea that @entity2 was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first			2
whatever effort @entity2 put into his marketing , he never let quality slip			2
in 1904 , the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the @entity115			0
it came as little surprise when he won			0
lucky no. 7 perhaps @entity2 's greatest coup was the name he gave his high - quality product -- old no. 7			1
naturally , nobody seems to know why			0
the official historian at the @entity123 today says it 's the most oft - asked question on factory tours			1
as you might imagine , many theories have been advanced			0
@entity2 believed the number seven was lucky			1
@entity2 was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed @entity2 's liquor			1
@entity2 misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and , upon finding it , labeled it " @entity123			1
" none of these stories , however , makes as much sense as the less - than - sexy explanation from @entity2 biographer @entity140			1
simply put , @entity2 was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7			1
but when the @entity143 consolidated districts within @entity48 , they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16			0
@entity2 did n't want to confuse his loyal consumers , and he certainly did n't want to bend to the government , so he began labeling his bottles " @entity123			1
" more than 125 years later , this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out			0
@entity2 without @entity152 @entity2 never married			2
some say it 's because he was married to his work ; others say it 's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards			0
or perhaps it 's just that he was too busy catering to the greater @entity162 population -- throwing elaborate @entity164 feasts , hosting exquisite costume parties in his second - story ballroom , and donating money to every church in @entity169			2
but by all accounts , @entity2 was quite a ladies ' man			2
he was a perfect dance partner , a polite conversationalist , and a fantastic gift - giver			0
unfortunately , he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter ( or even granddaughter )			0
once , @entity2 even asked for a woman 's hand in marriage , but her father denied him -- partly because @entity2 enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date			1
when @entity2 proposed , her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was " a little too old for such a young girl			2
" the early bird gets the gangrene hard as it might be to believe , in the end , the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early			2
as the story goes , one morning in 1906 , @entity2 arrived at his office before anybody else			2
he tried to access the company safe , but had a terrible time remembering the code			0
after a few frustrating minutes , he kicked the safe as hard as he could			0
he badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp			0
the limp only grew worse with time , and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning			0
then came gangrene , then amputation , and then , five years later , death			0
it 's not the happiest ending for the story , or the clearest cut , but it is the best , because it adds to the mystery and mystique of @entity2			1
as they say , where facts can not be found , legends fill the empty space and that 's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame			0
after all , as @entity2 himself believed , the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey			2
