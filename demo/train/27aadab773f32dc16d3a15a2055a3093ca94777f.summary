-- in light of some media coverage of their daughter @entity4 's recent hospital stay , her parents , @entity7 and @entity8 , have issued the following statement			1
in its entirety , it reads : every parent can imagine the pain and anguish we face as parents of a daughter who is working to recover from the dangerous actions she took while suffering a devastating heartbreak			0
as much as we hate dignifying tabloid stories with a response , we feel we must set the record straight to protect our family			2
the story that ran in the @entity26 on december 8 , and has been subsequently spread across the @entity27 , is filled with vicious lies and attempts to smear our character and that of our beloved daughter			1
we ask the public and legitimate media outlets to please " consider the source " and to not further exacerbate our daughter 's situation by repeating and legitimizing these false reports			0
with much appreciation , @entity7 & @entity8 Â© 2011 people and @entity42 all rights reserved .			0

@entity7 and @entity8 felt they needed to set the record straight
@entity7 and @entity8 say the december 8 @entity26 story is filled with lies
they ask the public and the media to consider the source and not repeat the *claims*
