-- @entity1 is observed around the globe on december 1			0
since the first @entity1 in 1988 , governments , organizations and charities have worked to raise awareness of the global aids pandemic caused by the spread of hiv infection			0
use the information in this one - sheet to provide students with an overview about @entity9 and @entity7			1
how widespread is @entity7 ? the @entity15 / @entity14 2007 @entity13 notes that since 1981 , when @entity7 was first identified in the @entity17 , more than 25 million people worldwide have died from @entity7 - related illnesses			1
it estimates that today , nearly 33.2 million people throughout the world are living with @entity9			1
according to the @entity23 , that includes more than one million @entity17			0
in 2007 , more than 6,800 people around the world were newly diagnosed with @entity9 each day , and of those new cases , approximately 1,150 were children under the age of 15 , according to the @entity15 / @entity14 report			1
what is @entity7 ? @entity7 is the acronym for @entity7			1
@entity7 is a disease of the body 's immune system that is caused by the @entity9 or @entity9			1
having @entity9 is different from having @entity7			1
a person can have @entity9 for many years before developing @entity7			1
however , as @entity9 progresses , it kills off the body 's cd4 cells ( also known as t - cells or t - helper cells ) , a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection			1
when the immune system loses too many t - cells , it does n't function normally and it ca n't fight off infections			0
as a result , people become vulnerable to many serious and often deadly infections and cancers			0
these types of illnesses are called " opportunistic infections " because they take advantage of the opportunity to attack the body 's compromised immune system , the @entity23 says			0
you may have heard that people die from @entity7 , but this is n't technically the case			2
people with @entity7 die from the opportunistic infections that @entity7 allows to take hold , not from @entity7 itself			2
how are @entity9 and @entity7 diagnosed ? while some people who are infected with @entity9 experience chronic symptoms such as fever , diarrhea , weight loss , night sweats and swollen lymph nodes , others may not develop symptoms for many years , according to the @entity72			1
the only way to tell if someone has @entity9 is with a blood test			2
if a person becomes infected with @entity9 , his or her body will try to fight the infection by making antibodies			2
if a blood test shows the presence of these antibodies , then the person is diagnosed as having @entity9 , and is considered " @entity9 positive			2
" likewise , you ca n't rely on symptoms to determine if someone has @entity7 , because the symptoms of @entity7 are similar to the symptoms of other diseases			2
in order to be diagnosed with @entity7 , a person must be @entity9 positive and have a t - cell count below 200 ( a normal count ranges from 500 to 1,800 per cubic millimeter of blood ) , or have one or more opportunistic infections , according to the @entity23			1
how is hiv transmitted ? @entity9 is found in blood , semen , vaginal fluid and breast milk			2
@entity9 can only be transmitted if one of these infected fluids enters the blood stream through contact with the mucous membranes , such as the mouth or vagina , or through direct contact , such as needle sticks or injections			0
according to the @entity23 , most people get @entity9 by : what treatments are available ? in the early days of the @entity7 pandemic , patients were unlikely to live longer than two years after developing the disease , according to the @entity17 @entity117			1
by studying the way that @entity9 attacks immune cells , scientists have developed drugs to fight both @entity9 and its associated infections and cancers			0
used in combinations known as " cocktails , " these drugs have helped patients live much longer after being diagnosed with @entity9			0
however , while these drugs can slow down hiv and damage to the immune system , there is no way to get rid of @entity9			0
though researchers are now testing vaccines to prevent and treat @entity7 , no vaccines have been approved for use outside of clinical trials , according to the @entity17 @entity117			0
what can people do to prevent the spread of @entity9 ? while there is n't a vaccine to prevent @entity9 infection or a cure for @entity7 , people can protect themselves and others from infection			1
experts from the @entity149 recommend that people learn about how @entity9 is transmitted and avoid any behavior that allows @entity9 - infected fluids to get into your body			0
if you are @entity9 positive , it is important to refrain from unprotected sex and other high - risk behaviors that could infect others , according to the @entity149			0
if you think you may have been exposed to @entity9 , experts recommend that you consult a doctor and get tested for the virus as soon as you are likely to develop @entity9 antibodies , which is within 6 weeks to 12 months after exposure , according to the @entity72			0
