-- @entity1 used to refer to himself as " the @entity3 tennis player who loses			1
while the 29 - year - old has spent most of his career in the shadow of his friend @entity8 , the most successful male player of the modern era , the 2014 season has brought a new world order			1
not only has @entity1 won his maiden major at january 's @entity12 -- earning him the new moniker of " @entity14 " -- but he has now ticked off another box after claiming his first @entity17 title			1
the celebrations were muted on sunday as he and @entity8 hugged over the net in @entity20 , but deep inside @entity1 was buzzing after coming from behind to triumph 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 2 against the 17 - time grand slam champion			1
such is their close relationship , it had been dubbed " the friendly final " as @entity8 went into the match with a 13 - 1 advantage in their meetings			1
" it 's amazing for me			2
it 's always special to play against @entity8 , my best friend and the best player ever			1
it 's always difficult to play him , especially in the final , " @entity1 told @entity34 after claiming the $ 550,000 first prize			1
the 1,000 ranking points that came with it will put him top of the race to @entity44 standings for the season - ending championships			0

i know that i can beat all the players , " said @entity1 , who appeared to step up a gear after a brief rain delay at 3 - 2 up in the second set			2
" i did an amazing job this week , beating some amazing players			0
physically , when i 'm at my best , i have a chance to beat all those guys			0
" i 'm going to enjoy this , i think that 's important			2
it feels great , winning on clay , winning against @entity8 , it 's really special			1
" with @entity59 's invincibility on clay seemingly having slipped a little , and second - ranked @entity79 awaiting a scan on the injured wrist that hampered him in saturday 's semifinal defeat by @entity8 , it leaves the way open for @entity1 to contemplate further success at the upcoming @entity85			1
@entity8 's participation at @entity85 is in some doubt as he awaits the birth of his third child , but the former world no. 1 can take some heart from his showing in the principality despite losing the final there for the fourth time			1

" to take the opportunities when they 're there , that 's key in a tennis player 's career			0
" i think it 's one of the those finals that i could have won			0
but @entity1 was tougher at the end			2
i think he deserved it just a little bit more			0
