@entity0 , @entity1 -- five years ago , @entity3 was a 15 - year - old spending his nights on the streets of @entity0 , @entity1 's capital			1
with his father dead and his mother too poor to adequately feed or clothe him , @entity3 survived by collecting and selling scrap			2
" i did n't have time to make friends , " he said			0
" the friends i did have ... would take me to do work that was n't good			0
... we would rob and steal from people			0
... i was scared i would get arrested			0
i was scared people would hit me			0
" it 's an all - too - common story in @entity0 , where many @entity1 youth -- often poor children from outside the city -- seek opportunity			1
if they 're lucky , they 're able to get by working odd jobs such as shining shoes or selling trinkets			2
" kids come to the streets hoping that it 'll be better than living in poverty in the countryside , but often they find that things are much worse for them here , " said @entity27 , whose nonprofit foundation helps @entity1 street children turn their lives around			1
it was through @entity27 's @entity39 that @entity3 was able to graduate high school and enroll in college			1
since 2004 , @entity39 has helped more than 350 @entity1 children get off the streets and into school			1
" ( our ) job is to make sure that the kids are safe and protected , first of all , " said @entity27 , 37			1
" and then once they are , we 've got to make sure they 're working toward something , whether that 's education or getting a job or improving their health			1
" a 2006 report from @entity55 estimated that 23,000 street children were living throughout @entity1			1
@entity27 said he has encountered children -- some as young as 6 -- sleeping under bridges and in trees			1
" @entity61 's in prison , dad 's a heroin addict			2
the kids ( are ) thinking , ' well , that 's my future as well , ' " @entity27 said			1
" our biggest challenge is to stop the kids from accepting that fate -- to fight their own fate and make their own future			1
" on the streets , children are susceptible to a wide range of threats and pitfalls : gang violence , bullying , child trafficking , the lure of a booming heroin trade			2
@entity39 tries to combat these issues by giving children what they need to get off the streets and stay off them			2
some common examples include safe housing , food subsidies , school sponsorships , job training and medical attention			1
" our ( initial ) goal was just to get them back to school , " @entity27 said			1
" we realized that to do that ... we would have to take that place of providing an income , giving them money for food , providing the shelter			2
we would actually have to take care of all aspects of their life			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity109 in @entity0 , @entity39 's center offers food , clothing , classrooms , play space and a computer lab. there is also bed space for 20 in the group 's nearby shelter			1
each child who comes through the center is provided with a dedicated social worker and has access to a psychologist , counselors , teachers and lawyers			0
" child by child , we 've got to work out what we can do and what they need , " @entity27 said			2
" and we 've also got to be careful that if the child has a family , that the family is as involved as possible			0
" in addition to the @entity0 center , @entity39 also has three other locations throughout @entity1 that help street children and those living in extreme poverty			1
funded by donations and grants , the foundation has assisted more than 2,500 children in all			0
" i grew up in poverty , " @entity27 said			2
" i often used to think to myself , ' i could do something good with my life if only someone would come and give me that chance			0
' and then i was here in @entity0 ... and i realized now i 'm the guy			0
i 'm the guy who can help these kids and give them a chance			0
" @entity27 , an @entity154 , moved to @entity1 in 2002 to teach @entity155 at the university level			1
within several months , he met a few street children shining shoes and was inspired by their untapped potential			0
he befriended the boys and began teaching them with the help of one of his university students , @entity162			0
as he met more and more street children in need , @entity27 eventually decided to quit his job and devote himself full - time to @entity39			1
today , he has a staff of 44 , several of whom have been helped by the foundation in the past			0
" there really was no thinking at that time that this would become something big , " he said			0
" it was just a case of , here are these kids , there 's no one else to help them , but i can			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity39 website at @entity180 and see how to help			0
