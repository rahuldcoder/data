-- two days before @entity2 , vice president @entity1 paid a visit to foot soldiers serving on the front lines of the 2012 campaign : suburban @entity7			0
early voting had been under way in the @entity11 battleground for weeks ; the @entity13 team was counting on a volunteer army to deliver the state			1
the polls in the race 's final weeks had careened back and forth between razor - thin @entity13 and @entity19 leads			1
but @entity1 told the volunteers he was n't worried -- and they were the reason : " the ground operation which you guys represent is the best in the history of presidential politics			0
" " i 'm telling you , it 's this way in @entity31 , it 's this way in @entity33			0
... and i think that the one thing that is going to fundamentally make the difference is you guys -- for real , " @entity1 said			1
" i 'm not just trying to be nice			0
i really genuinely believe that 's the deal			0
" @entity13 takes key battlegrounds to win election republicans , surveying the very same landscape at the very same time , sounded a much more skeptical note			1
" we are poised to blow the @entity13 campaign out on @entity2 thanks to a superior @entity48 ( get out the vote ) program , " @entity45 political director @entity44 wrote in a memo sent the day after @entity1 's @entity7 visit			2
" the @entity13 campaign 's superior ground game is a myth , " said @entity44 , promising a @entity42 victory			1
" it 's ( ground ) game over			0
" just one day later , @entity42 were echoing the vice president 's assessment , with one top @entity45 telling @entity0 : " their ( ground game ) deal was much more real than i expected			1
" on paper , @entity66 ' turnout efforts this year dwarfed those of their @entity42 counterparts			1
the 125 million voter contacts the @entity13 team claimed were more than twice the @entity45 total			2
the hundreds of @entity66 field offices outnumbered @entity42 outposts by greater than 2 - 1 or 3 - 1 in key swing states			1
but the @entity13 campaign insisted it was n't just about the numbers			2
@entity13 's re-election makes history , again " many field campaigns have historically favored quantity over quality			1
we do not , " @entity13 national field director @entity82 told reporters just before @entity2			1
" these are not phone calls made from a call center			0
they are done at the local level by our neighborhood team leaders , members and volunteers , who are talking to people in their communities			0
" and in an election cycle where billions of dollars were spent on attack ads -- far more than ever before -- that kind of old - school retail politicking may have made the difference			2
in the home stretch , the @entity19 campaign pointed to a big jump in voter contacts this year over @entity104 's 2008 effort			0
but a significant percentage of the voter contacts they pointed to included indirect contact -- like door hangers -- that did n't give voters the all - important sense of personal connection			2
meanwhile , the @entity13 campaign 's turnout effort flooded the zone			2
while @entity42 were still battling for the nomination in the spring , the number of @entity13 field offices in key primary season states likely to play significant roles in the fall -- states like @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity33 -- already outnumbered those of all his potential @entity42 challengers combined , even though the president was n't facing any primary season challengers			1
even with a massive infrastructure advantage and major head start , an @entity13 edge on the ground was no sure thing			2
@entity45 enthusiasm was far higher in 2012 than it had been four years earlier , and indications were that @entity66 enthusiasm had slipped			2
well - funded super pacs took on some ground game efforts for the @entity19 campaign , and polls conducted in the home stretch found voters in the most hotly contested battlegrounds felt they 'd been only slightly more likely to hear from @entity13 's campaign than @entity19 's			1
@entity145 demand more from @entity13 's second term but these super @entity137 turnout operations were largely new and untested compared with the @entity13 machine and veteran union allies			2
even with aggressive outreach to voters , both they and the @entity19 campaign were ultimately less likely to actually reach voters than the @entity13 team			1
and in an election where swing state percentage gaps between the two candidates were in the single digits , even the slimmest gains along the margins loomed large			0
record - breaking numbers of voters cast their ballots before @entity2 this year -- half the voting population or higher in some states -- and the @entity13 campaign was able to bank huge leads weeks ahead of the race 's final day			1
republicans played down the disparity in field offices and early vote totals			1
the office and staffer count , they said , were meaningless metrics			0
" if we wanted to have as many staff and offices , we could do that , " @entity19 political director @entity178 told reporters last month			0
but these @entity13 outposts , no matter how small , were n't just window dressing ; they filled a couple of key functions			1
since each was staffed with at least one @entity191 staffer , they served as an initial point of contact with the campaign , and a recruitment center for local volunteers			0
they provided a central location for campaign events , for phone banking and for data collection			0
and their permanence allowed the campaign to develop vital local insight : to build detailed voter files on potential supporters , field test the best ways to motivate them , and push them to cast their votes weeks before @entity2			0
opinion : @entity13 will get little time to celebrate republicans said those early voting efforts by the president 's campaign were just tapping out their support from voters who would have shown up for him in the end anyway -- and that the edge fueled by early voting would evaporate when @entity45 voters headed to the polls on @entity2			1
they were n't entirely wrong ; a good chunk of those early @entity66 votes came from banking ballots from the president 's strongest supporters , base voters who would have shown up no matter what			1
but that early vote cushion was n't just cosmetic			0
it helped create an aura of inevitability on the ground in key swing states			1
it provided an insurance policy against potential vote loss to @entity2 lines and snafus			0
and instead of devoting valuable home stretch resources to bringing guaranteed votes to the polls on @entity2 , the campaign could instead focus on using those hard - core supporters as @entity2 foot soldiers , employing the most personal and effective form of voter persuasion to bring less enthusiastic backers to the polls			0
" you go as hard as you can until the end			0
that 's what we 're going to do until the very end , " said @entity13 campaign manager @entity255			2
the end in @entity7 : a 50 % -47 % win for the president .			0

*analysis* : *robust* field campaigning , direct contact with voters made the difference
" many field campaigns have ... favored quantity over quality . we do not , " top @entity13 aide says
@entity66 field offices outnumbered @entity42 outposts in key swing states
