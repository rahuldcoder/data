-- a phone hacking scandal may have cost @entity2 his biggest - selling newspaper in 2011 , but the billionaire media mogul managed to end the year with a modest addition to his empire -- an account on @entity9			1
within 48 hours of debuting with tweets about family , work and politics , @entity2 had pulled in more than 45,000 followers and stirred internet debate over why the 80 - year - old was now embracing a technology often used to attack him			1
the tweets also raised doubts that the notorious technophobe was writing the messages himself			0
twitter creator @entity23 -- one of only four people being followed by @entity2 -- however insisted that the media mogul was writing " with his own voice , in his own way			2
" @entity2 appears to have made his @entity9 debut on @entity30 with a couple of brief comments on books including the biography of late @entity36 boss @entity35 , which he called " interesting but unfair			2
" these were followed by praise for cinema releases " @entity42 , " and " @entity43 , " both produced by @entity2 's @entity44			1
these fueled suspicions that @entity2 's @entity9 account was being used as a publicity tool to help improve his image after a damaging year			1
" could be brilliant @entity52 pr operation , " @entity2 biographer @entity50 tweeted after earlier commenting : " might be somebody who knows @entity2 , but it 's not @entity2 ( he does n't use a computer unassisted nor get his own email )			1
" others claimed that the voice of the tweets , as well as their faltering grammar and punctuation , were unmistakably @entity2			0
" you can tell by the tweets he 's doing it himself , " wrote @entity0 's @entity62 , a former editor of one of @entity2 's newspapers			1
a spokesperson for @entity2 's @entity52 confirmed to @entity0 the account is genuine			1
the account could offer new insight into a businessman whose life has been under intense scrutiny this year after revelations that journalists at @entity78 , one of his most profitable newspapers , illegally accessed the voicemail messages of scores of celebrities and public figures			0
@entity9 played a prominent role at the height of the scandal when it was used to pressure advertisers into boycotting the paper			0
commentators said the loss of revenue was a key factor in @entity2 's decision to shut the paper down			2
@entity2 's subsequent appearance before a @entity100 parliamentary inquiry into phone hacking also caused a sensation on @entity9 , particularly after his wife , @entity103 , pounced on a man who tried to attack him with a foam pie			1
there were echoes of @entity2 's parliamentary appearance -- which he called the " most humble day day of my life " -- in @entity110 pledges which he tweeted in a january 1 message to @entity23			1
" my resolutions , try to maintain humility and always curiosity			0
and of course diet ! " but there were also signs that the media mogul was still getting to grips with social media			2
reports suggested he was forced to quickly delete one post -- possibly after @entity125 leapt to his aid once again			0
the @entity127 -- a fierce rival of his @entity130 publications -- was among news outlets claiming that @entity2 was guilty of " tweeting - before - thinking " for suggesting that the @entity100 have too many holidays for a " broke country			0
" the message was apparently removed , but not before someone tweeting as @entity103 implored : " @entity137 ! ! ! delete tweet ! " a further post on the unverified @entity125 account later added : " @entity141 @ rupertmurdoch was only having a joke @entity144 ! ! ! " [ sic ] @entity2 also follows an account that appears on the surface to be @entity148 ceo @entity147 but is actually run by a man in @entity150			0
it 's not clear whether @entity2 realizes he 's not following the real @entity147			0
among other tweets by @entity2 , who also follows @entity154 ceo @entity153 and @entity156 entrepreneur and @entity100 businessman @entity155 , were an expression of support for @entity161 presidential hopeful @entity160 .			0

@entity2 has *notched* up more than 45,000 followers after *joining* @entity9
@entity2 's tweets so far focus on family , politics and cinema releases
80 - year - old 's social media appearance called a pr stunt by some
@entity52 official confirms to @entity0 that account is genuine
