@entity1 , @entity0 -- it would be news enough in itself -- the departure of one of business education 's brightest young stars to the private sector -- but @entity11 's announcement that he is to stand down as dean of the @entity13 carries a wider impact			1
back to school ? an @entity16 in downtown @entity17 , @entity18 @entity11 , still only 43 and credited with helping applications to the school rise by 50 percent in his four - year tenure , is leaving to become the first ever dean of the so - called @entity24			1
the computer and tech company has yet to say exactly what @entity24 is -- an @entity24 spokesman called it only an " exciting new project " -- but many people assume it is likely to be an in - house executive education and training facility for employees			2
if confirmed , @entity11 's move highlights the way in which increasing numbers of corporations set up their own " corporate universities , " designed to provide tailor - made training to staff			1
according to one academic study of the phenomenon , by 2001 there were already around 2,000 corporate universities around the world			0
these are not necessarily intended to replace mbas or @entity49 at traditional business schools			0
they tend instead to be far more narrow in focus and specifically geared to the individual needs of the corporation in question			0
and yet , corporate universities have increasingly borrowed ideas and methods from business schools , a trend which with @entity11 's departure has now apparently extended to poaching staff			2
@entity11 was seen as a hugely successful dean for @entity13 , overseeing a revamp of the school 's curriculum as well as a notable boost to its reputation			1
in an email to staff and students announcing his departure , @entity11 spoke of his regret but said he had long harbored a passion for all things @entity24			1
" while there are many great companies , i can not think of one that has had as tremendous personal meaning for me as @entity24 , " he wrote			2
" i remember writing my first computer program on an @entity24 , remember pulling an all - nighter to watch the @entity82 ( attached to my 128k @entity83 ) print my undergraduate thesis at seven minutes per page			0
" so what will the former professor of economic sociology , who was at the @entity89 and @entity90 schools before @entity13 , be doing at @entity24 ? the @entity92 quoted unnamed @entity24 " company insiders " as saying @entity11 would mastermind executive education programs within the computer company			1
this would not be a first for @entity98			0
while the most famous corporate universities have been in industry and the service sectors , most notably the 47 - year - old @entity103 , which has trained generations of @entity106 's managers , technology firms have taken this idea a stage further			0
animation film studio @entity109 -- where @entity24 boss @entity110 was formerly ceo -- runs a huge range of courses for staff at its own corporate university			1
@entity115 is intended to teach more than just the nuts and bolts of modern day computer animation , but to inspire employees ' creativity with a wide range of classes , more than a dozen a week , which staff are permitted to miss work to attend			0
" we offer the equivalent of a @entity127 in fine arts through our courses , " says @entity115 's dean , @entity125 .			0

@entity11 , dean of @entity13 , is to step down
he is to head " @entity24 " at the tech firm of that name
*observers* predict this is going to be a " corporate university " for staff
