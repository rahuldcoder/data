to @entity2 prosecutors , @entity0 is simply a murder suspect , and a dangerous one at that			1
but to at least some of the thousands of fans who know him as a hero for using a hatchet to stop another man 's attack on two people in @entity12 , @entity13 , accusations that the long - haired homeless hitchhiker bludgeoned a 73 - year - old lawyer to death are unfathomable			1
" i 'm having a hard time seeing @entity24 as a cold - blooded killer , " one of his fans posted on his @entity22 page friday			0
" i hope they really listen to him and do a proper investigation			0
" another fan started trying to raise money for a legal defense fund			0
as of midday friday , it had collected $ 66			0
@entity0 , who after the @entity12 incident became known on the internet as " @entity24 , " is accused of killing attorney @entity36 at the lawyer 's @entity37 , @entity2 , home			1
authorities who went to @entity36 's house on a welfare check after he failed to turn up at work found him monday -- severely beaten , dressed only in socks and underwear			0
@entity50 police arrested @entity0 on thursday evening , hours after authorities identified him as a suspect and were then " flooded with calls from around the country , " @entity48 prosecutor @entity47 said			1
one of those calls came in around 5:45 p.m. from a man whose neighbor said she 'd dropped @entity0 off at a @entity2 train station earlier thursday			1
around the same time that info came in , another came in saying a worker at a @entity61 in @entity50 had just spotted a man who looked like @entity0			1
police spotted @entity0 at a nearby @entity65 bus terminal minutes later and arrested him without incident , @entity47 said			2
" the investigation came together very quickly , " the prosecutor said			1
@entity36 and @entity0 had exchanged text messages in recent days , and investigators know @entity0 spent sunday night at @entity36 's home , @entity47 said			2
while authorities say they do n't know a possible motive , investigators believe @entity0 and @entity36 had a sexual relationship , @entity47 said			1
" there has been some indication of that on @entity22 , " the prosecutor said			0
a post tuesday to @entity0 's facebook page seems to suggest the writer felt he had been sexually assaulted and asked his fans , " what would you do ? " @entity86 is n't able to verify who posted the message			1
@entity0 is being held in @entity50 pending extradition to @entity2 , @entity47 said			1
once transferred , we will be held on $ 3 million bond pending a first court appearance , the prosecutor said			0
@entity0 received national attention after @entity86 affiliate @entity95 interviewed him about a february incident in which he had hitched a ride with a man who suddenly proclaimed to be @entity99			2
the man then rammed a utility worker on the side of the road before grabbing a woman who was trying to help			0
@entity0 's @entity22 page says that " @entity24 saved a woman 's life by cleaving a man in the head , with a hatchet , after he had just hit someone with his car			2
" with long hair sweeping out of a bandana , @entity0 provided a dramatic account of the rescue for the station , demonstrating how he wielded the hatchet against the rampaging motorist			2
" smash ! smash ! sa - mash ! " he told the affiliate			0
the female bystander , apparently not injured , confirmed the incident in an interview with @entity95			0
the utility worker underwent surgery for non-life - threatening injuries , and the driver , who stood more than 6 feet tall and weighed at least 300 pounds , was arrested , the affiliate said			0
@entity0 's story was featured on " @entity131 " and " @entity132			2
" @entity47 acknowledged the internet fame surrounding @entity0 , but said that means nothing when it comes to the accusations he is now facing			1
" this man was well - known			0
that does n't mean he did not or could not become involved in a crime , " @entity47 told reporters before @entity0 's arrest			2
" we believe he has murdered someone -- an attorney by the way who was in the county , was well respected , well regarded for well over 40 years			0
" " i believe that everyone is a little safer with this person off the streets , " the prosecutor said after @entity0 's capture .			1

" the investigation came together very quickly , " the prosecutor says
@entity0 is *jailed* for *allegedly* killing a @entity2 lawyer
prosecutors suggest the pair had relationship ; @entity0 felt assaulted , a post suggests
he gained @entity165 fame as a hitchhiker who came to the aid of two under attack
