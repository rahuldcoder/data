-- what we know -- and psychiatrists have diagnosed for decades -- as schizophrenia may really be eight separate diseases , research published in @entity8 suggests			1
scientists at @entity10 in @entity11 analyzed the dna of more than 4,000 people with schizophrenia			1
they matched any gene variations they found in the dna with study participants ' individual symptoms			1
in doing so , they found several " gene clusters " that appear to cause eight distinct classes of schizophrenia , according to a statement from the university			1
" complex diseases , such as schizophrenia , may be influenced by hundreds or thousands of genetic variants that interact with one another in complex ways , " the study authors wrote in their introduction			1
" genes do n't operate by themselves , " dr. c. @entity34 , one of the study 's senior authors , explained in the statement			1
" they function in concert much like an orchestra , and to understand how they 're working , you have to know not just who the members of the orchestra are but how they interact			2
" schizophrenia is a chronic brain disorder that affects about 1 % of the population , according to the @entity49			1
symptoms can vary from hallucinations to disordered speech to attention and decision - making problems			0
past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80 % of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited , the study authors say			1
a study published in july showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder			1
but scientists have had trouble identifying specific genetic variations that put people at risk			1
the @entity10 researchers looked at instances where a single unit of @entity17 was altered , which is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism , or @entity73			2
then they identified 42 interactive @entity73 sets that significantly increased people 's risk of schizophrenia , according to the study			1
in other words , if study participant @entity80 had @entity82 , he was 70 % more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant @entity85 who did n't have that cluster of genes			1
in some cases , certain gene clusters were matched with close to a 100 % increase in risk			0
" in the past , scientists had been looking for associations between individual genes and schizophrenia , " co-author dr. @entity94 said in the statement			2
" what was missing was the idea that these genes do n't act independently			0
they work in concert to disrupt the brain 's structure and function , and that results in the illness			0
" the idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new , says dr. @entity112 , a professor of psychiatry at the @entity114			1
it 's similar to the way doctors use the term " breast cancer " to describe several different diseases that cause tumors in the breasts			0
" schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases , " @entity112 says			2
" all psychiatric conditions likely share this heterogeneity			0
" there are only so many ways that certain malfunctions in your genetic code can manifest , @entity112 says			2
there may be 10 separate gene mutations , but they might only express themselves as one or two symptoms			0
so what 's causing hallucinations in one person might be different than what 's causing them in another			0
so why are scientists trying to separate out the different schizophrenia disorders ? two reasons , @entity112 says : to help predict who might get schizophrenia , and to help treat it more efficiently			2
take , for example , pleurisy , which is a condition where the liquid around your lungs becomes inflamed			0
several things can cause pleurisy , including a viral infection , pneumonia or cancer			0
if you have a drug that treats pneumonia , it 's going to help only a certain percentage of patients with pleurisy			0
but if you know that your patient 's pleurisy is caused by cancer , you 'll find a different course of treatment			0
the same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions , @entity112 says			2
" in psychiatry land we 're still stuck with pleurisy , " he says			0
" they 're descriptions of symptoms , and we only have a vague idea of the underlying causes			0

researchers say schizophrenia is not one disorder , but eight
genetic variations cause eight classes of schizophrenia
