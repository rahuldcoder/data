@entity2 has completed all of the preliminary steps required to conduct a nuclear test , a @entity1 government official said			1
the @entity1 detected the closure of the entrance of a tunnel at the @entity9 in a northeastern region of @entity2			1
it means that @entity13 is now ready for what could be its fourth nuclear test , the official said			1
" this is the final step in preparing to test a nuclear device , " the official said thursday			2
" in theory , there are seven to 14 days to conduct a test once the entrance is sealed			0
" the official added that it was highly likely the @entity2 would test an enriched uranium device , as it does not seem to possess a lot of plutonium			2
the official also said the @entity27 might launch a long - range ballistic missile instead , if it decided not to conduct a nuclear test			1
this would " show off their two - way track capability , " the official said			0
asked if the @entity2 had been able to construct a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on a missile , the official said : " we believe that @entity2 has made a considerable progress in technology to miniaturize the nuclear warhead and that they are really doing their best			2
in fact , @entity2 is spending a substantial amount of money and time ( on this )			0
" the comments came the day before @entity45 president @entity44 arrived in @entity1 as part of a visit to several @entity49 countries			1
@entity44 was previously in @entity50 and continues on to @entity51 on saturday			0
in an interview with a @entity1 newspaper ahead of his arrival friday , @entity44 warned @entity13 over the possibility of carrying out a new test			2
" if @entity2 were to make the mistake of engaging in another nuclear test , it should expect a firm response from the international community , " @entity44 told @entity57			1
the @entity2 @entity62 earlier this week described @entity44 's trip as " a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region			2
" @entity1 's @entity68 said this week it had increased its military preparedness since monday morning and was monitoring around the clock for signs of activity at the @entity9			0
@entity2 announced last month that it would n't rule " a new form of a nuclear test " to strengthen its nuclear deterrent capabilities			1
experts have speculated that that could refer to the testing of a uranium bomb			0
the reclusive regime in @entity13 is known to have conducted three previous tests , all of them believed to be based on plutonium			0
the most recent one took place february 2013			0
the past tests prompted international condemnation and the imposition of sanctions aimed at hampering the @entity2 's weapons program			0
since the last underground detonation , @entity1 officials have repeatedly said that they believe @entity2 is ready to carry out another test at any time , pending a political decision to go ahead with it .			1
