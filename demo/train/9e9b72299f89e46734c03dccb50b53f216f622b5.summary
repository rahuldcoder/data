-- was 1962 the year classic , post- ' 50s rock was hatched ? let 's make that case			2
fifty years ago , the @entity5 recorded their first session at @entity8 's @entity7 ( later @entity9 ) studios , cutting an early version of " @entity12 , " and @entity13 and the @entity14 released their first albums			0
and it was exactly 50 years ago that the first incarnation of the @entity18 -- @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 , along with pianist @entity22 , bassist @entity23 and drummer @entity24 -- played their first concert , at @entity8 's @entity27			1
the band was still so embryonic that they called themselves the @entity29			0
of course , being reminded that the @entity18 have been around for five decades is almost unnecessary			0
the band has n't had a @entity31 hit in over 20 years , but whether we want it to or not , it never seems to have gone away			1
from @entity20 ' garrulous best - selling 2010 memoir , to @entity35 's " @entity38 , " to @entity19 himself hosting " @entity39 " this year , the culture always seems to circle around to the @entity18 just when you 'd think we 'd all had enough of them			1
part of that is intentional : to some degree , the stones have always been driven to be competitive in the pop marketplace			1
" absolutely , " @entity45 told me in an interview in 1997			0
" it gets in the blood , man			0
arrogant , elitist sons of bitches that we are , we still think we 're getting better			0
" but part of their eternal appeal is out of their hands , too			0
why do we still care about the @entity18 after a mind - boggling 50 years ? a few possible reasons : their songs and catalog			1
as obvious as it is to say , it really is about the music			0
there 's a reason pop church lady @entity66 could cover " @entity67 " or that " @entity39 " could send off @entity68 with " @entity69 " and " she 's a @entity71 " : the best @entity18 songs , meaning ones written before roughly 1980 , are eternal and built on impeccable melodies			2
for all their bad - boy images , @entity19 and @entity45 seem , in retrospect , like one of the last of the great songwriting teams -- @entity80 , or @entity81 and @entity82 , with more groupies and pharmaceuticals			1
even work that seemed lesser at the time -- 1973 's beautiful stupor , " @entity88 , " for instance -- holds up better than you 'd expect			0
the way the @entity18 continually paid homage to black music -- from covering @entity94 and @entity95 to a disco - era hit like " @entity97 " -- also gave them a broader fan base than many of their peers			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 dynamic			2
little in old or new rock comes close to the testy yin - yang relationship between the band 's two founding members and longtime @entity108 ' em duo			2
over the years , they 've publicly sniped at each other , culminating in @entity45 ' dishy depictions of @entity19 as a preening diva in his memoir , " life			1
" see never - before - seen photos of the @entity18 those comments -- and the way much of the media used @entity45 ' words to pile on @entity19 themselves -- missed the point , though			1
what always made the @entity18 so magnificent was the way @entity45 ' crusty musical conservatism was balanced by @entity19 's pop - chart - driven opportunism , and vice versa			1
they need each other , and in so doing , they 've become their own endlessly watchable @entity129 reality show			0
the @entity18 embody a time when rock ' n ' roll was n't just " outlaw " culture ; it propelled the culture			1
that 's no longer the case , as a recent conversation with a teenage music fan confirmed to me			0
an avid pop lover , she does n't listen to any " rock " ( that is , music made by men or women who play guitars )			2
for her , @entity150 -- which used to be called techno or electronica -- is the new rock ; its big beats , drug allusions , and the way its bombastic thump offends anyone over 40 ( or anyone who prefers traditional verse - chorus pop songs ) make it the modern - day version of rock			1
factor in pop , hip - hop , and country , all major genres these days , and you can see how rock is now one small slice of the cultural pie			2
for many , the @entity18 are a vivid , last - gasp reminder of a time when rock -- and white males -- dominated the landscape			2
they do n't make rock stars like that anymore			1
with a few glorious exceptions , like @entity181 , many of today 's major rock bands are charisma - challenged or nondescript			0
onstage , they 're uptight			0
contrast that with the sight of @entity19 at least year 's @entity185 , working the stage in best rock - preacher mode and singing @entity190 classics in a green suit			2
the performance should have been hokey , but it was shockingly spellbinding after all these years			0
@entity35 's @entity194 ca n't move like that , either			0
@entity18 celebrate 50 years of raucous rock'n'roll the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : @entity18 have n't had top hit in 20 years , yet they are enduring presence
he says the band has been willing to shape - shift to compete in pop marketplace
he says @entity19 , @entity45 great songwriting team with tense , *compelling* *personal* dynamic
@entity212 : in @entity18 ' era , rock propelled culture ; they do n't make stars like that now
