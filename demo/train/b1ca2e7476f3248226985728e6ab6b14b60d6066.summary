-- it 's a truth of the digital age			0
when a person is plucked from obscurity , for good reasons or bad , the first thing curiosity - seekers do is turn to the @entity8			0
we expect social media to shed light on a person 's personality , especially when , as in the case of @entity20 shooting suspect @entity19 , we 're trying to explain the unexplainable			1
as it turns out , 24 - year - old @entity19 , who stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more during a shooting spree at a movie theater friday , appears to have left virtually no digital footprint			1
media and law enforcement investigating the shootings have found no traces of him online , aside from a possible account on @entity32 , a romantic meet - up site , according to police			2
former colleague shocked that @entity19 is theater shooting suspect it 's impossible , of course , to draw broad conclusions about his mindset based on the fact that he did n't share online			1
but @entity19 ' lack of an online presence has emerged as a piece of the puzzle for people looking for answers			1
" we could ask the same questions about the lack of web presence that we could for anyone who isolates themselves			0
was he socially isolated in all senses ? " asked dr. @entity54 , director of the @entity55			0
" we know that social isolation can amplify the negative consequences of stress and increase the risk of developing psychopathology			2
some research has shown that social isolation actually delays the positive effects of activities found to be emotionally beneficial , such as exercise			2
... what we do n't know is what caused @entity19 to have such a break with reality			2
" whatever his reasons , the lack of an online presence puts @entity19 squarely in the minority among his peers			1
about 81 % of 18 - to 29 - year - olds in the @entity78 use social media at least occasionally , said @entity80 , director of the @entity82 's @entity81			1
and surveys show that college students like @entity19 , who was a graduate neurosciences student at the @entity85 , are even more likely to use the sites			1
but @entity87 says it would be a mistake to draw a direct line between his decision to eschew social networking and a mindset that led to the alleged violence			1
" it 's not the norm for someone of this age to have such a limited presence , in any form : no blogs , no profile on a photo - sharing site and things like that , " @entity87 said			2
" but it 's also a mistake to think the everyone in this age cohort is living every minute of their lives with social media			1
that 's not the case			0
" massacre suspect spooked gun range manager the survey did n't ask respondents for specific reasons that they choose not to engage online			0
but @entity87 said @entity82 has heard numerous reasons , from concerns about wasting time to privacy concerns to simply preferring face - to - face interaction			2
in a @entity82 survey from november , two - thirds of respondents ( 67 % ) said that staying in touch with current friends is a major reason they use social media , and half gave similar importance to connecting with old friends			1
only 3 % said that finding a romantic partner was a major reason for their of digital networking tools			0
" it 's certainly an interesting element of his life that ( @entity19 ) had such a limited digital presence , " @entity87 said			2
" but it 's not necessarily the case that this means anything about the quality of his social world			0
" dr. @entity149 , a professor of business psychology at @entity151 , has studied the impact of internet use on mental health			0
he too says it 's impossible to nail down its significance at this point but listed a set of possibilities , from a sense of isolation to distaste for @entity9 as an emblem of " the status quo " to something perhaps even more sinister			2
" he ( possibly ) did not want to have any reputation other than for what he was planning to do , like someone who saves himself for the big stage or a single lead role , " @entity149 said			0
similar attacks in the recent past have , in some cases , painted a different picture			0
@entity177 , charged in the january 2011 shootings in @entity179 , @entity180 , that killed six people and wounded congresswoman @entity182 , was active on @entity183 and @entity184 , among other online networks			0

@entity186 was a prolific blogger who was active on @entity9 , @entity10 and other sites			2
he posted a video to @entity184 only hours before his shooting rampage			0
by contrast , reporters looking into the mindset of @entity195 , the 23 - year - old student who killed 32 people and wounded 25 others in an april 2007 massacre at @entity199 , found almost no traces of him online			1
shooting survivors recount @entity20 movie theater horror the lack of a digital footprint for @entity19 has created some unpleasantness for an unexpected group : people who share his relatively common name , live in the area of the shooting and do have a web presence			1
" it amazes me how insensitive , heartless and just plain old ignorant some people are in this world , " a different @entity19 , this one a fitness instructor who , like the suspect , lives in @entity215 , wrote on his @entity9 page			1
" in the last 24 hours i have received hate mail , racist remarks , and sexual advances			0
i have over 400 friend requests in which a quarter of those are ppl mocking the real killer to gain attention and this was all after the identity of the real killer was revealed ... " @entity232 , who lives in the @entity234 area , left a similar note on @entity9 , albeit in a more wry tone			0
" i am not a 24 - year - old gun - slinging killer from @entity215 , i am a 22 - year - old book - slinging mass eater from @entity241 ... , " he wrote			1
" @entity19 happens to be a pretty common name , surprisingly , so try not to jump the gun			0
regards , a different guy named @entity19			0
" with few , if any , conclusions to draw , @entity54 said the most interesting observation about society as a whole may be how surprised we are that the suspect did not use social media			1
" it 's a testimony to how normal participating in the social media world is when we look at the lack of presence as an anomaly , " she said			1
" ( we wonder , ) ' what 's wrong with this guy that he 's not at least on @entity9 ? ' " grief counselors offer solace amid tragedy analysis : why gun controls are off the agenda in @entity78 victims of @entity20 massacre remembered with poignant stories @entity0 's @entity270 contributed to this report .			1
