-- it was @entity3 's birthday on august 14 , and no one celebrated			1
the monsoon floods that engulfed most of the country and affected 20 million people have added yet another burden of misery onto the shoulders of the average @entity3			1
more than 4 million people are homeless			0
livestock , crops and livelihoods were destroyed			0
how far this once - proud nation has fallen			0
in @entity16 , @entity3 means the " land of the pure			1
" it reflects the noble intentions of its creators to build a nation that enshrined the best of @entity25 principles			0
unfortunately , that nobility has given way to chaos because of bad luck , incompetent political leaders , corruption and religious extremism			0
@entity3 may be a world away from the @entity33 , but instability feeds the extremism that fuels terrorism , so we ignore this crisis at our peril			1
to find the path forward , we must look back to the past			0
during the 1970s , my father packed up our family of five and moved us to @entity3			2
he believed @entity3 had higher standards of early schooling and stronger social values than his adopted home of @entity49			1
soon after , @entity51 tanks rumbled into @entity52 and then came wave after wave of @entity52 refugees			2
by the mid ' 80s , the full impact of the war waging next door came home to @entity3			2
the @entity33 priority was to evict the @entity51 from @entity52 at any cost			1
as a result , educating the masses , dealing with a sea of refugees , nurturing democracy , developing infrastructure and eradicating @entity52 heroin all took second place			1
the @entity3 my father brought us home to experience was disappearing before our eyes			2
this was a defining moment			0
instead of focusing on its own problems , it chose instead to fight the war for the @entity81 , and 30 years later , @entity3 is still paying for this decision			2
after @entity51 withdrew from @entity52 in 1989 , the @entity33 walked away			1
growing unrest and infighting in @entity52 gave the @entity85 an opportunity to step in			2
the only thing that mattered to the @entity85 was how quickly and crudely the practitioners could inflict their horrifying version of @entity25 on the @entity52 people			2
then , all hell broke loose on september 11 , 2001			0
since 9/11 , @entity3 has supported @entity33 's intervention in @entity52 , the right decision but one fraught with controversy			1
it has torn @entity3 into factions and triggered suicide bombings			1
even before the monsoon hit , the country was an economic , political and social disaster			1
can @entity3 be saved ? i believe it can , but the fortunes of this ailing nation can only be changed with @entity33 's help			1
@entity33 may not have intended to hurt @entity3 , but it 's clear that @entity3 's support for @entity33 policy contributed to its decline			1
the good news is that today there is real opportunity for change			0
@entity3 needs @entity33 's help			1
@entity33 needs a stable @entity3			1
the @entity33 was the first nation to offer aid after the flooding disaster , pledging $ 150 million			1
this is a positive first step in a much - needed long - term reconstruction plan for @entity3			2
but as important as the money is , ensuring that it 's spent on the right things is even more critical			0
the @entity3 government needs to focus on three things to stop the country 's downward spiral : education , infrastructure and security			1
educating @entity3 is not a matter of choice , but of utmost necessity			2
the literacy rate for men is 61 percent , and for women it 's 32 percent			0
ignorance breeds poverty and extremism			0
education can help break that cycle			0
@entity137 must be in place to teach every child to read and write			0
educating the country 's @entity141 leaders is just as important			0
these mullahs interpret the @entity144 for the people , and often they do so in an uninformed , uneducated way that distorts the true teachings of @entity25			0
a national program to certify these religious leaders is needed to address this most pressing challenge			0
as for infrastructure , what little was there has been washed away			0
the roads are a mess , electricity goes out most days and not enough food is produced			0
the failure of the government to deliver on the basics has demoralized the population and dampened the spirits of its entrepreneurs			0
@entity3 has to fix the electrical grid and improve its agricultural sector			2
the @entity33 could help by opening its doors to @entity3 exporters and embarking on programs to share knowledge and help @entity3 industrialists grow their companies			1
in terms of security , with @entity52 at war on one side and the barely held truce with @entity177 on the other , @entity3 needs to secure its borders , ignore the problems of its neighbors and focus internally			1
this means militarizing its border on the @entity52 side and closing it to all but legitimate trade traffic			2
the core source of strife with @entity177 is the 63 - year - old dispute over @entity189 , where in the past two decades , more than 80,000 @entity190 have been killed			0
if @entity33 were to assist both countries in solving this issue , it would go a long way to repairing the @entity3 - @entity177 relationship			1
education , infrastructure and security : @entity3 must focus on these areas with laser - like intensity and exhibit courage and vision to raise its people out of despair			1
i believe in @entity3 , as my father did			0
and with @entity33 's support and investment , someday @entity3 may even be able to dream again of achieving its noble destiny as the " land of the pure			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity189 : even before floods , @entity3 was an economic , political , social mess
aid for @entity33 in @entity52 tore @entity3 into factions , sparked suicide *attacks* , he writes
@entity189 : @entity3 needs @entity33 's help ; @entity33 needs a stable @entity3
@entity3 must focus on education , infrastructure and security , he writes
