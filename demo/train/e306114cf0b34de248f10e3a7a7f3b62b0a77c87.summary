@entity1 , @entity0 -- one of the ships in a @entity5 - bound flotilla blocked by @entity0 tried to flee on monday and was stopped by the @entity6			1
@entity0 called for the immediate arrest of the ship 's captain , but organizers on the ship insisted they no longer had a captain			1
in a tweet , organizers said " extreme damage " was done to the @entity15 ship , the @entity16			1
" when commandeered & towed by @entity6 it was slammed into a concrete wall , " the tweet said , adding that the ship was " taking on water			2
" they also tweeted that the travelers on board " moved up on deck are in good spirits and are not leaving the boat			1
" earlier in the day , the ship tweeted that it was " casting off from @entity0			1
" " the @entity16 is leaving port in @entity33 , and we are breaking through @entity36 's @entity5 blockade which now extends to @entity38 ports , " organizer @entity30 said in the statement			1
the ship 's @entity40 feed carried a tweet from a journalist on board , @entity45 , saying kayakers were blocking the @entity6 , and the @entity15 boat had left the harbor			1
minutes later , the ship tweeted , " we got about 5km ( 3.1 miles ) away from shore			2
@entity38 authorities have taken over the boat and appear to be heading back to port			2
" @entity45 tweeted that no one was injured in the @entity38 takeover of the boat , and delegates were " non violent in blocking wheel house			2
" the @entity6 issued a statement saying , " the @entity16 tried to leave the port of @entity61 in @entity33 without permission			1
the @entity6 has intercepted the ship and it is now being taken back to the port			2
as a result the prosecutor 's office has already asked for the immediate arrest of the captain			1
it is not clear if this will be extended to other passengers on board			2
there are an estimated 40 people aboard the ship			1
" but the ship tweeted , " we left port without a captain			1
we released captain and crew from contract and sailed under control of international volunteers			2
" no further details were given			0
" our boat is surrounded by @entity38 police , tied up at port			2
supporters from town are chanting , ' @entity93 , @entity0 , ' " the ship tweeted			1
the @entity16 was brought to the port of @entity61 on the @entity38 island of @entity33			1
the @entity16 is one of 10 ships trying to head to @entity5 despite @entity36 's maritime blockade			1
last week , the @entity6 intercepted a @entity101 ship in the flotilla , the @entity99 , about 10 minutes after it left @entity103 , triggering an hours - long standoff			2
the ship -- full of activists but no humanitarian aid -- was ultimately tied up at a @entity38 naval facility , and its captain , @entity109 , was arrested			1
the @entity6 said @entity109 had left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger			0
he will appear before @entity38 prosecutors on tuesday			0
@entity0 's government offered sunday to ship aid to @entity5 -- a move the @entity119 chief applauded but protest organizers and @entity122 authorities derided as insufficient			1
@entity0 's foreign ministry released a statement sunday afternoon in which it proposed to " undertake the task of transporting the humanitarian aid , with @entity38 vessels or other appropriate means , through existing channels			1
" foreign minister @entity130 talked by phone with @entity119 @entity132 ban ki - moon , who thanked @entity0 and expressed support for the initiative , according to a @entity119 statement			2
" in his view , it could help to reduce tensions in the region and ensure much - needed aid is delivered to those who need it in @entity5 , " the @entity119 statement said of @entity132 's views , adding the world body will " work closely with @entity0 , @entity36 and @entity122 authorities on this matter			1
" but chief @entity122 negotiator @entity147 said sunday that funneling food , cement and other goods via other means , such as @entity38 ships , missed the point , which he said is to " immediately lift , not ease " @entity36 's maritime blockade of @entity5			0
he lauded those behind the flotilla as people " who have dedicated their time , effort and passion for a just cause			0
" @entity36 says its blockade is necessary to try to halt the shipment of weapons into @entity5			0
militants in @entity5 have launched numerous deadly attacks against @entity36			0
the territory is run by @entity170 , which has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks and is listed by the @entity101 as a terrorist organization			0
@entity36 also emphasizes that it delivers large amounts of aid to @entity5			0
the country has mounted a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail			0
the @entity36 government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill @entity36 military personnel should their boats be boarded			0
@entity36 officials alleged that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on @entity36 commandos			0
flotilla organizer @entity191 dismissed the allegations as ludicrous on june 28 , saying , " they see this nonviolent , ragtag group of ships as such a threat they 're using their entire propaganda apparatus , and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists			0
" the @entity203 -- composed of officials from the @entity101 , @entity119 , @entity205 and @entity206 -- issued a statement saturday asking " all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas , which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation			0
" the quartet added that it " strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of @entity5 to do so through established channels , so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings			0
" doing so , the group contends , is the best way to both help @entity122 and address @entity36 's " legitimate security concerns			0
" @entity147 said that while @entity122 leaders " support international engagement in lifting the unjust and inhumane @entity36 blockade , " the quartet 's statement and their opposition to the planned flotilla to @entity5 skirt the broader challenges in the region			0
" we invite them to focus on resolving the root cause of the conflict , which is the occupation , rather than seeking ways to manage its destructive symptoms			0
@entity2 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
