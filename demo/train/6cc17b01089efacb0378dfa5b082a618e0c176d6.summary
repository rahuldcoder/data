-- @entity1 , the tech giant 's @entity2 - connected headset , is n't on the market yet			1
but that has n't stopped one lawmaker from trying to keep the eyewear off the highways in his state			0
in a pre-emptive move , @entity12 state rep. @entity11 introduced legislation friday that would amend existing laws against texting while driving to prohibit " using a wearable computer with head mounted display			1
" the bill does n't mention @entity1 by name , although @entity11 told @entity0 he was inspired to amend the law after reading an article about the gadget			1
if passed , the law would make @entity12 the first @entity27 state to ban motorists from wearing @entity1 while driving , a @entity25 spokesman said			1
the law would take effect july 1			0
" the primary thing is a safety concern , " @entity11 said in an interview			1
" it ( the @entity1 headset ) could project text or video into your field of vision			2
i think there 's a lot of potential for distraction			0
" announced last year , @entity1 is an augmented - reality headset that looks like a thin pair of eyeglasses and can be controlled by voice commands			1
above and to the right of the wearer 's right eye is a small screen that can display @entity25 search results , e-mails , reminders and other information			2
the device also comes equipped with a tiny camera that can snap photos and record videos			0
@entity1 is not expected to go on sale until late this year at the earliest			0
a price has not been announced , although the company has been selling a limited number of pre-order models , targeted at developers , for $ 1,500			0
asked about the proposed @entity12 law , a @entity25 spokesman sent the following statement : " we are putting a lot of thought into the design of @entity1 because new technologies always raise new issues			1
we actually believe there is tremendous potential to improve safety on our roads and reduce accidents			1
as always , feedback is welcome			0
" for example , @entity25 has said its @entity1 headset could offer turn - by - turn navigation , with voice commands , to enhance the driving experience			1
@entity25 has said one goal of its @entity1 project is to make technology available when users need it but unobtrusive when they do n't			2
the company said the screen on its @entity1 headset actually sits above the wearer 's normal field of vision , not unlike a car 's sun visor , and is meant for quick glances , not prolonged viewing			2
@entity1 has generated a lot of buzz in tech circles and beyond , with many wondering aloud about its practical applications , potential privacy concerns and its promise , for better or worse , of constant connectedness			2
although he does n't want to see it on his state 's roads , even @entity11 says he is intrigued			0
" i think it 's pretty interesting , " the state representative said			0
