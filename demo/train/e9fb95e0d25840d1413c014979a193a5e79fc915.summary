-- more than 2 million @entity2 troops have been deployed to @entity3 and @entity4 since october 2001 , and it has been estimated that one in five of those veterans are likely to be afflicted by post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression			1
@entity9 is working to help some of them enjoy life again			1
through her nonprofit , @entity12 , @entity9 helps veterans train their own service dogs in northern @entity15			1
she often helps match veterans with dogs from shelters or rescue groups			1
@entity0 asked @entity9 for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity22 of 2012			1
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity12 ? @entity9 : since june , i have received emails and phone calls from all over the country asking for information on how to get service dogs for veterans			1
some requests are coming from the veterans themselves , but most are coming from family members watching their loved ones struggle with @entity38 , traumatic brain injuries and mobility issues			1
it 's heartbreaking to learn about what these veterans and their families are going through , and even harder to hear their stories and know @entity12 could help more of them if we had additional resources			2
i am hoping that with the recognition , we will ( be able ) to build the @entity49 and hire our mentor trainers , who are veterans that have completed or are completing the program			2
( we want to ) put them and other veterans to work training others and expand into a national organization to help even more			2
but even more important , i hope it helps bring awareness to the issues that our veterans -- male and female -- face coming home injured			1
i hope it helps ( our group ) enlighten the public and government that service dogs can be a viable tool for assisting veterans , especially those suffering from ptsd and sexual trauma			1
the canine - human bond is an amazing gift that can make a difference for an individual to begin to feel and create their own new normal			0
how can we not support it ? if we change just one life and make it better , why wo n't we ? @entity0 : what was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 @entity22 ? @entity9 : this is an amazing journey			1
my life was already blessed , and this is icing on the cake			0
what an amazing group of people to be included with			2
i still can not believe it is happening , and ( @entity92 ) have to pinch myself to know i 'm not dreaming			0
this is not about me ; it is about the veterans and the sacrifices that they and their families have made			2
this honor is for them			0
the veterans and clients that we work with every day are my heroes			2
the courage that they show every moment , just getting through the simple tasks or things that we take for granted , is my inspiration to keep moving forward and help even more			0
they do not even realize the strength they give me every day			0
who should be the @entity22 ? cast your vote now ! @entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity22 ? @entity9 : i intend to continue using whatever funding and positive publicity comes our way to increase public awareness about veterans ' invisible wounds and expand our service dog training programs			1
there are animals in shelters that will make outstanding service dogs , and there are veterans in desperate need of them			1
we just need to make the connections to start them on their path together toward a new normal			0
we will work toward building our new facility and helping more veterans and hiring veterans			2
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity9 : conventional treatment is only part of the solution ; we need to think outside the box and look at other treatments and tools that can help improve the quality of life for our veterans and others with disabilities			1
a dog that is highly trained to do specific tasks for an individual is one of those tools			0
the veterans still need the medical ( treatment ) , but medical can not address the spirit - soul			2
therapy is n't there 24/7 -- a dog is			0
combine what works , and maybe we can improve their quality of life			0
just ask any veteran who used to isolate ( himself ) , get in fights , lost his family , had no hope for the future , thought about suicide -- they will tell you			0
we can make a difference , and we owe them a chance to enjoy life again			0
... being a veteran myself , i understand loss of purpose , the mission			0
training their own service dog gives them that and more			0
it gives them a shot at a quality life again			0
