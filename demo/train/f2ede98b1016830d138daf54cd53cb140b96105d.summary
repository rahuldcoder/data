-- world - record signing @entity1 scored on his debut as @entity4 kicked off the @entity6 football season with a shaky 3 - 2 victory at home to @entity9 on saturday night			1
@entity1 celebrates after paying off a small chunk of his record transfer fee with a goal on his real debut			2
@entity4 's new generation of " @entity15 " were preceded onto the pitch by the world 's fastest man @entity17 , with the @entity20 sprint star dribbling a ball to the delight of a packed @entity24 crowd			0
coach @entity25 fielded seven new signings against a team who stunned @entity4 2 - 1 on the opening day last season to foreshadow a season of massive upheaval for the underachieving capital club			1
the first goal took just 26 minutes in coming as $ 92 million signing @entity35 fed the ball to $ 50 million capture @entity37 , whose shot rebounded off the post and fell welcomingly to @entity4 captain @entity41 to score			2
@entity1 , who cost $ 130 million when he left @entity42 , then rose highest to meet a free - kick from $ 50 million midfielder @entity44 but headed over the bar			0
@entity9 stunned the home crowd in the 30th minute when former @entity4 striker @entity47 was allowed a free header to equalize in the type of defensive lapse that typified @entity4 's performances last season			1
but while @entity25 has obvious problems to sort out at the back , where he fielded debutants @entity54 and @entity56 in the absence of the suspended @entity58 , he has volumes of attacking resources at the other end of the pitch			0
his team took the lead again in the 34th minute through @entity1 , who coolly slotted home from the penalty spot after @entity41 went down under goalkeeper @entity68 's challenge following a clever pass from midfielder @entity70			1
however , @entity4 could not hold onto the lead , with veteran @entity72 firing a leveler from the edge of the area just 43 seconds into the second half following a cross by @entity78			0
@entity72 should have made it 3 - 2 with an even easier chance 12 minutes later , but he sidefooted another pass from @entity82 wide of the @entity4 goal			1
@entity4 continued to pile forward in numbers , peppering the @entity9 goal , but it was the unexpected figure of @entity70 who netted the eventual winner in the 60th minute with a low drive from outside the box			1
@entity37 should have doubled the lead soon after following a mistake by @entity68 , but saw his chip over the keeper rebound off the bar			0
the @entity96 made way for last season 's top scorer @entity98 in the 72nd minute , with the @entity100 lucky to avoid being booked for a blatant dive in the penalty area			0
@entity4 's rivals @entity103 start the defense of their title on monday at home to @entity108 , having already won a trophy this season by beating @entity111 1 - 0 in the @entity112 on friday .			2

world - record signing @entity1 scores on his debut for @entity4
real kick off the @entity6 football season with a 3 - 2 win at home to @entity9
@entity41 scores opening goal and @entity1 's first - half penalty makes it 2 - 1
