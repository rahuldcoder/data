-- the @entity1 has approved a new drug to treat bacterial skin infections like @entity4 , also known as @entity4			1
@entity4 is caused by a strain of staph bacteria that 's become resistant to most antibiotics			1
it 's life - threatening and is often found in hospitals and other health care settings			0
the new drug , called @entity11 , is taken intravenously			0
the drug is only approved for use in adults , according to the @entity16 - based company that markets the drug , @entity18			2
what makes it different from other @entity4 antibiotics is the way it was approved			2
@entity4 can survive for days on planes this is the first drug labeled by the @entity1 as a @entity25			1
@entity25 is part of a program that the administration hopes will encourage drug companies to develop new drugs like @entity11 that will fight the epidemic of antibiotic - resistant infections			1
any drug designated @entity25 by the @entity1 gets a priority review and expedited review process			1
if approved the drug also then qualifies for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity			0
antibiotic - resistant infections are considered such a threat , in a report released earlier this year the @entity39 said that these infections could derail the " very achievements of modern medicine			1
" the report characterizes the problem as so bad that a " post-antibiotic era " is " far from being an apocalyptic fantasy			0
" the @entity39 report says if health trends continue , a time when typical antibiotics do n't work on run of the mill kinds of infections is " a very real possibility for the @entity55			1
" hospitals getting better about mrsa antibiotic - resistant bacteria infect at least 2 million people each year , according to the @entity59			1
of those , at least 23,000 die as a direct result of the infection and many more die as a result of conditions complicated by that infection , mostly in hospital and health care settings			0
the number of health care spread mrsa cases is declining , according to the @entity59			1
but on any given day 1 in 25 hospital patients has at least one health care associated infection			0
most happen to patients who are not in intensive care units			0
that means you could go into the hospital for a knee surgery and end up leaving with a serious infection that normal antibiotics do n't treat			0
experts say @entity4 became a real problem for the health care system as doctors spent decades over-prescribing antibiotics			1
patients who came in for treatments for colds and flus were given antibiotics even though such infections do n't typically respond to medication			0
when you need antibiotics -- and when you do n't over time , the bacteria that did survive these treatments reproduced and infections that were resistant to antibiotics became wider spread			2
outbreaks of @entity4 called community - associated mrsa have happened at schools , day care centers , and in gyms , and are typically spread by skin - to - skin contact			1
protecting student athletes from @entity4 staph infections typically start with small red bumps which can turn into painful abscesses that often require surgical draining			2
the latest tool to fight @entity4 , @entity111 , was approved after two clinical trials that included 1,289 adults with this kind of infection			2
the adults were given @entity117 or another antibacterial drug			0
@entity119 was as effective as that drug for the treatment of this infection			0
the most common side effects for people on the drug during the trail were nausea ( 5.5 % ) , headache ( 4.7 % ) , and diarrhea ( 4.4 % )			0
