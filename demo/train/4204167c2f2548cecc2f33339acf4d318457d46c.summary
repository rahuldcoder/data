-- giant jellyfish descend on the @entity2 , causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind			1
a diver attaches a sensor to a @entity11 's jellyfish off the coast of northern @entity13 in october 2005			1
sounds like a great sci - fi flick			0
it 's real and a nightmare for @entity13 fishermen			0
the massive sea creatures , called @entity11 's jellyfish , can grow 6 feet ( 1.83 meters ) in diameter and weigh more than 450 pounds ( 204 kilos )			1
scientists think they originate in the @entity23 and in @entity25 waters			0
for the third year since 2005 , ocean currents are transporting them into the @entity2			1
@entity27 , a marine biologist at @entity29 's @entity28 , said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents			1
he said they stay together in packs and as they drift northward , they get caught in fishermen 's nets			2
the giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world			2
but @entity11 's stands out because of its enormous size			1
" the sheer size of them , individually , makes them fairly spectacular , " @entity27 said			0
spectacular , perhaps , to scientists , but perilous to villagers along the @entity13 coast who have seen the destructive habits of these colossal creatures in the past			0
they had giant - jellyfish invasions in 2005 and 2007 , and because they 've recently been spotted in the @entity2 , they 're bracing for another , potentially harmful wave this summer			1
the jellyfish destroy fishermen 's nets , getting trapped in them , tearing holes and ruining catches			2
fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers			2
when swarms of giant jellyfish tear them , the result is devastating			0
" communities of fishermen and these fishing villages own these nets , " @entity27 said			2
" when these nets get wiped out , it actually has this economic devastation for an entire community			0
" the good news is that previous attacks have prompted @entity13 to put in place a warning system for fishermen			0
while they still risk losing a big catch , they can , at least , save their pricey nets from the invasion of the giant jellyfish			0
it 's not clear why waves of @entity11 's jellyfish have made it to the @entity2 in recent years			1
some have speculated that overfishing , pollution or rising ocean temperatures may have depleted the kinds of fish that prey on @entity11 's jellyfish in the polyp stage			1
however , no one is certain , @entity27 said .			0
