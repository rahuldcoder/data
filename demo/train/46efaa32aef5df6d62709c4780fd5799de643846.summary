-- the @entity2 ferry that sank dramatically on wednesday with hundreds of passengers on board had been modified after coming to the country from @entity6 over a year ago , according to reports on @entity0 affiliate @entity8			1
the @entity9 -- operated by @entity10 -- regularly plied the @entity11 to @entity13 route , a journey that usually takes 13 - and - a - half hours , according to information from the company 's website			2
@entity13 is a popular destination in @entity2 -- known as the " @entity19			1
" the @entity9 is listed at 146 meters long and with a gross tonnage of almost 7,000 tons			2
it boasts five cargo and accommodation decks			2
it is listed as having a capacity of 921 passengers , but was only carrying a reported 429 when it unexpectedly started taking on water early on wednesday			0
within hours , all that was above the water surface was the bow of the boat			0
the ferry was built in a @entity6 shipyard 20 years ago and previously operated in that country 's waters			0
it was refitted upon arrival in @entity2 in february 2013 , @entity8 reported			1
the ship 's sleeping cabins were reconstructed after its arrival in @entity2 , the network said			1
@entity44 president @entity43 , a former general in the @entity45 and former commander of the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) told @entity8 that the refit may have affected the weight of the boat and could be a reason for the accident			0
according to @entity43 , the reconstruction added around 239 tons of weight to the boat from its original form			0
investigators probing the incident will likely look at various aspects of the boat , including this reconstruction			0
" as the center of the weight of the boat becomes higher , it becomes more difficult for the boat to balance , " the expert told @entity8			1
there have been serious ferry accidents in @entity2 before			1
the most recent maritime accident occurred in 1993			0
this was attributed to overcrowding			0
the @entity9 , however , was nowhere near capacity on the night of the 15th , when it left @entity11 several hours late -- delayed because of heavy fog			0
tough conditions with difficult circumstances hampering rescue dives -- including tidal currents , choppy , frigid conditions , wind , rain and seabound fog -- more radical engineering solutions are being explored			1
at around noon on thursday local time , workers began trying to pump air into the boat , hoping air pockets might be expanded within the structure , helping to lift the ferry			1
these efforts have proved unsuccessful so far			1
authorities say that they will try again when the tide turns			0
analyst @entity43 told @entity8 this method has been used previously , on the @entity94 and @entity95 warship wrecks , as example			0
three 3,600 - ton " sea cranes " are due to arrive friday to assist with efforts			1
" the cranes are being moved as fast as possible , the focus is getting them there early , " said @entity99 , a @entity100 and fisheries representative			2
" what will be done with them will be determined by the @entity107 on site			2
" if the boat has not been stuck into the seabed then we will raise ( it to ) the surface with cranes and move them to a place where it will be easier to work on them			2

difficult conditions are hampering search efforts
vessel was refitted upon arrival in @entity2 in february last year
rescue workers have been attempting to pump air into the ship
