" we do n't negotiate with terrorists , " has long been the standard refrain of governments when it comes to violent extremists			1
but these days , when it comes to the realm of social media , they are at least talking to them			1
in recent years , the @entity10 has launched social media efforts to engage jihadists and their sympathizers online , contesting their claims with the intention of dissuading potential converts to @entity18 extremism			1
" we are actually giving @entity22 the benefit of the doubt because we are answering their arguments , " says @entity19 , coordinator of the @entity10 's @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , which runs the program			1
" the way i see it is we are participating in the marketplace of ideas			2
" that marketplace is now online , and the corners of it dedicated to @entity18 extremist talk can be surreal , noisy , sometimes horrifying places			1
@entity36 social media : decapitations , appeals for wives like no conflict before , the @entity44 war , the prime focus of the world 's jihadists , is being discussed , disputed -- and waged , in its propaganda aspects -- on social media			1
the content ranges from the shockingly grisly to the bizarre			2
combatants post photos of decapitated heads as trophies of battlefield victories , or images of victims from their own side , captioned with vows to avenge them			2
links to grainy phone - camera footage abound , documenting everything from group executions , to a video appeal summoning @entity18 women to come to @entity44 to find a husband among the @entity66 rebels			1
on @entity68 , jihadists post their theological quandaries : how to watch football when it means being exposed to men 's bare legs ? often informed by the memes and language of the broader @entity76 , the content is disseminated swiftly around the world through a diverse network of jihadists and their supporters , journalists , analysts and onlookers			2
in this way , social media has become a prime conduit for motivating budding extremists to take up arms			1
a study recently published by researchers at @entity91 traces how @entity93 - based radical preachers with strong social media influence have inspired a wave of @entity96 to fight in @entity44 , where they are now estimated to account for about a quarter of the 11,000 foreign jihadists in the country			1
in response to this threat , the @entity100 government has been " messaging " in social media in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 for three years now , attempting to penetrate the virtual echo chambers of jihadist thought with contrary points of view			1
but it is only since their @entity114 - language @entity68 feed was launched in december , becoming a pugnacious new voice in the conversation , that their efforts have increasingly drawn attention -- and raised eyebrows -- in the @entity93			2
this development has led to the spectacle of the @entity100 government publicly bickering with jihadists and their ideological fellow travelers on social media , debating @entity44 , the @entity126 , " the clash of civilizations " in 140 - character bursts			1
a typical exchange occurred recently when a pro-jihadist @entity68 user admiringly posted an image of a desecrated @entity133 , one of the monumental statues in @entity135 destroyed by the @entity136 in 2001			2
the @entity20 account tweeted in response : " destroying ancient culture out of hatred and backwardness are a feature of @entity22 's ideology			2
" " crying about so - called ancient culture when there was no food and children were dying out of hunger , " scoffed the @entity66			0
" the shortage of food in @entity135 was due to @entity136 's disastrous policies , " replied the @entity10 account			1
another user chimed in with a tweet at the @entity10 : " @entity22 just bombed a kindergarten and school with your funding and guns			1
" trolling the terrorists ? some observers have been dismissive of the @entity10 's efforts , conducted under the banner : " @entity164			1
" @entity165 , a journalist who , with a colleague , has launched a @entity68 account and podcast dedicated to jihadist social media , and sometimes tussles with the @entity10 account online , describes their activities as " trolling			1
" " as a psy - op tool , it 's pretty laughable , " he said			0
" they target journalists and analysts with as much verve as attacking jihadis			0
" but others say the efforts appear to having some success at " getting in the heads " of senior @entity18 militants			1
" for years , @entity22 had gotten in the heads of the @entity100 government , and the @entity100 government had become very sensitive to various @entity22 talking points , " says @entity184 , a scholar of militant @entity18 at the @entity185 , who was involved in setting up the @entity20			1
" i felt there 's no reason why we ca n't return that favor ... the more you can make them think on these points , the more you can damage their credibility and shape their behavior			0
" for his part , @entity19 , a former @entity100 ambassador to @entity202 , rejects the " @entity10 troll " label			1
" some people use that because i think it 's convenient shorthand for an adversarial relationship , " he said			0
" to me , ( a troll ) ... is a person who is annoying and obnoxious and stupid			0
well , we 're none of those things , because we 're answering their charges with facts			0
" but he admits to drawing on the same emotional arsenal as an internet troll in the center 's work			0
" people who study the internet more than i do ... mention that the two things that motivate people the most when it comes to social media are comedy and anger , " he said			1
" if you 're talking about @entity22 -- let 's face it , it 's going to be negative			0
so it might as well be pointed			0
" ' an ungoverned space ' for the @entity100 government , entering the social media fray to argue with terrorists has required a substantial paradigm shift			1
the default posture had been not to dignify the extremists with a response			1
but gradually , said @entity19 , the government realized that doing so was simply surrendering ground to their opponents			2
" we seek to contest space that previously had been ceded to our adversary , " he said			0
@entity22 tends to thrive in " the ungoverned spaces of the world , " such as " the @entity252 desert , or places in @entity106 or @entity254 or @entity44			0
the @entity76 is also an ungoverned space , so it 's an area of opportunity for them			0
" @entity22 has long publicly acknowledged the crucial importance of propaganda to their cause , he said , with its leader @entity262 quoted as saying that " more than half " their battle to win the hearts and minds of @entity96 was being waged through media			2
" we in the @entity93 think kinetic strikes or arresting people or fighting ... that 's important , " said @entity19			0
" media stuff ... it 's secondary or tertiary			2
@entity22 does n't see it that way			0
" the aim was also , broadly , to make " life more difficult for the extremists			2
" " it 's very easy if you 're out there and able to say whatever you want and nobody contradicts you , " said @entity19			0
read more : unsettling video shows large @entity22 meeting in @entity254 @entity184 said the online space taken up by jihadist chatter has expanded and become much more diffuse in recent years , as it had migrated from discussion boards to social media platforms like @entity68 , and been increasingly conducted in @entity114			1
" there are many more people talking , " he said , adding that while that meant they could be harder to find , " once you find them you really can insert yourself and engage directly			0
they have to listen to it , at least until they block you			0
" @entity19 said the @entity20 's efforts were aimed not at converting extremists -- although " it would be nice " -- but reaching the wider audience of onlookers that jihadists were trying to influence			2
" in a way , we 're picking a fight with the extremists , because the extremists are there to radicalize other people , " he said			2
their " bread and butter " was using jihadists ' own content to make the case against them , he said , such as when they recently hijacked a hashtag in @entity104 -- " accomplishments of the @entity18 state " -- that had been started by supporters of the bloodthirsty @entity66 militant group @entity318			1
the @entity20 account used the hashtag on 176 tweets that @entity19 said listed the true achievements of @entity318 : " things like poverty , murder , detracting from the decency of the @entity44 revolution , helping the @entity331 regime by trading oil with them			0
" is it working ? studies have pointed to the potential shortcomings of this kind of work : that the counter-messaging is simply ignored , as @entity165 suggests it often is , or stirs up antagonism by providing an opponent for extremists to rally against			1
so is the project working well enough to justify its 50 staff and a $ 5 million a year budget ? @entity19 says feedback had been positive and the work would continue , although it was difficult to quantify results objectively			0
" we are never going to know ... unless they put up their hand and say ' i saw your stuff and decided not to become a terrorist ' , " he said			0
" you 're almost never going to get that			0
" the initiative , already active across @entity68 , @entity359 and @entity360 , would look to branch out to other social media where jihadists were active			1
" what about @entity364 ? what about @entity366 ? what about @entity368 ? " said @entity19			0
" in a way , we 're mirroring or shadowing what they do			0
" @entity184 said he considered the program " a qualified success , " and that criticisms of the work tended not to be data - driven			0
" i do n't think anyone believes this has been a dramatic blow against terrorism recruitment ... but i think on this particular measure of getting inside the heads of terrorist recruiters and leaders -- at least in the @entity22 orbit -- it has been successful			2
" he believed jihadist groups had been rattled by certain of the @entity20 's claims -- in particular , that the victims of @entity18 extremists were predominantly other @entity96			1
it was possible to tell when messaging had struck a nerve , he said , as jihadist leaders would typically respond " by putting messages out on the discussion boards saying , ' listen , they 're putting these lies out , do n't engage them '			1
" " we got quite good at this during the @entity400 , and then we forgot , because as the only superpower , we did n't really have to do it , " he said			0
" ( but ) the @entity100 government is rediscovering its skills in this sort of thing			0
" watch : what new video reveals about @entity22 watch : new @entity22 video raises serious questions			0

the @entity10 has begun engaging with @entity18 extremists on social media
it hopes to dissuade potential @entity18 militants by presenting an *alternative* viewpoint
some have derided the initiative as ' trolling , ' while others say it is rattling jihadist leaders
social media has become a vital recruiting ground for @entity18 extremists
