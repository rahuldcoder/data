-- the movement to stop a horrific new @entity3 - like penal code in @entity4 is growing			1
on tuesday , i spoke at a rally organized by the @entity7 to demand that the sultan of @entity4 immediately rescind the new law that includes the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians and the public flogging of women			1
these " kill - a - gay " laws or laws that allow the brutal whipping of women for abortions violate international law and have no place in civilized society			1
my husband , @entity25 , said it clearly at the rally : " what year is it , 1814 or 2014 ? " as a board member of the @entity7 , i fought to stop the @entity3 in @entity30			2
when no one else was paying attention , we were there , exposing the @entity3 's reign of terror and the special viciousness it reserved for women and girls			1
we built a strong , diverse , unrelenting movement against the @entity3 and helped @entity30 women rally against gender apartheid			2
we fought the @entity3 then , and we will fight these @entity3 - like laws now			2
there is no room for compromise			0
we are talking about people being stoned to death			0
we are talking about people being flogged			0
as we saw all too recently in @entity30 , flogging can lead to death or paralysis			1
this is cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment for actions that no one should dare call " crimes			2
" no one should be killed for who they are or whom they love			0
women should not be abused for making their own health decisions			2
the @entity62 has expressed deep concern about this new penal code and has stated unequivocally that the @entity4 law violates international law and human rights			1
now that the sultan of @entity4 has announced that the law will begin to be phased in , the @entity68 and the @entity69 must condemn the @entity4 government			1
and if @entity4 fails to rescind this gruesome law , the @entity69 should investigate whether @entity4 should be allowed to remain a member of that body , a privilege it has had since 1984			1
i pledge to do my part			0
the @entity7 pulled its annual @entity79 , an event that @entity82 co-chair every year , from the @entity83 -- a @entity85 property owned by the @entity86			1
the agency is managed by the @entity4 @entity88 , which is controlled by the sultan			1
we simply could not hold women 's rights event at a hotel whose owner blatantly violates basic human rights			2
we have also joined with lgbt rights groups and other women 's right groups to protest this draconian new penal code			1
although the law is being styled as a " religious " law , we see here , as we saw in @entity30 , that religion has little to do with it			0
this is about a dictatorship using terror tactics to control the population			0
and we ca n't stand for that			0
the sultan announced last week that he would phase in the new penal code over three years -- and the first phase , which includes fines and prison sentences , went into effect may 1			2
the second phase includes corporal punishment such as amputations and flogging women who have abortions			1
the stoning to death of gay men and lesbians is slated for the third phase			1
but we can stop it			0
we 've done it before , and you can help			0
the @entity7 has launched a massive petition drive and social media campaign using the hashtag # @entity133 , calling on the government of @entity4 to rescind the code and asking the @entity69 to take action			1
sign the petition , and then spread the word			0
we want everyone to know about this outrageous penal code			0
for human rights and dignity , it must be changed			0
join us on @entity145 / @entity144 .			0
