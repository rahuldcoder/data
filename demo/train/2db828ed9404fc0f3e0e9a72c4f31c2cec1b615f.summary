undocumented immigrant students in @entity1 will be able to receive state - funded financial aid in 2013 to attend college , under a new law signed saturday by gov. @entity5			1
the law allows top students who are on a path to citizenship to apply and receive the state aid , the governor said			1
about 2,500 students are projected to receive @entity13 totaling $ 14.5 million , according to the @entity1 @entity14			2
that averages out to $ 5,800 per student			0
the funding amounts to 1 % of the overall $ 1.4 billion @entity20 program , officials said			1
the new law , @entity23 , is one of two pieces of legislation known as the @entity27 and will become effective january 1 , 2013 , officials said			1
" going to college is a dream that promises intellectual excitement and creative thinking , " @entity5 said in a statement from @entity29			0
" @entity34 benefits us all by giving top students a chance to improve their lives and the lives of all of us			2
" currently , illegal immigrant students in @entity1 must pay resident tuition rates if they graduated from a state high school and are actively seeking to legalize their immigration status , officials said			2
the other half of the @entity27 was signed into law by @entity5 in july and allows undocumented immigrant students to receive privately funded scholarships administered at public universities and community colleges			1
that law , called @entity23 130 , was needed because the @entity53 and @entity54 systems avoided giving the private scholarships to their undocumented students , citing vagueness in laws , said the legislative aide to @entity27 's author , state assemblyman @entity63 ( @entity62 - @entity61 )			1
@entity63 called saturday 's signing " historic " and path - breaking for the @entity71 -- coming at a time when many states such as @entity67 and @entity68 are passing aggressive laws targeting undocumented immigrants			0
some of those laws are being challenged in court			0
" the signing of now both parts of the @entity27 will send a message across the country that @entity1 is prepared to lead the country with a positive and productive vision for how we approach challenging issues related to immigration , " @entity63 said in a statement			0
" today , @entity83 and @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 -- and thousands of other students who are some of the best and brightest in @entity1 -- have been told by our governor and legislative leaders that you are welcome here , that you have something to contribute , that you can be proud of what you have accomplished and that your talents and ambition will not go to waste , " @entity63 said			0
under @entity23 , undocumented immigrant students will be eligible for state board of governors fee waivers , student aid programs administered by a college or university , and the state aid @entity13 program for state universities , community colleges , and qualifying independent and career colleges or technical schools in @entity1 , according to @entity63			0
the @entity27 differs from a proposed federal bill called the @entity111 -- or @entity112 -- @entity27 , which would create a path to citizenship for immigrants who entered the @entity71 illegally as children under the age of 16 and have lived in the @entity71 for at least five years , obtained a high school or general education development diploma , and demonstrated " good moral character , " according to a @entity122 fact sheet .			2

the funding amounts to 1 % of the overall $ 1.4 billion @entity20 program , officials said
the students will be at the top of their class and on a path to citizenship
the new law , effective in 2013 , is half of the @entity27
the other half was approved in july , allowing private scholarships for *similar* students
