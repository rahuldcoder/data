@entity0 -- a federal judge ruled tuesday that there is enough evidence that former reality tv producer @entity5 murdered his wife at a @entity9 resort to justify his return to @entity11 to face trial			1
@entity5 , once a producer on tv 's " @entity14 , " will appeal the extradition order to a higher court , which could keep him in the @entity18 for another year , his defense lawyers said			1
@entity11 prosecutors charged @entity5 last year with the aggravated murder of @entity21 while the couple and their two young children vacationed at a resort			1
the defense withdrew its request to have the 6 - year - old daughter take the stand at tuesday 's extradition hearing because of " some concerns about her ability to testify today , " lawyer @entity25 said			1
the situation was " very upsetting " to the child , she said			0
instead , the judge allowed the defense to use a sworn statement from the child 's counselor that quoted her saying she never saw her parents argue of fight during the vacation			1
the child 's statements to her therapist were also used to explain how her father got some cuts and scrapes on his body that investigators said indicated he was in a struggle with his wife			2
@entity5 , who has been in jail in @entity0 since november , has been allowed to visit with his children each week , his lawyer said			1
he will apparently attend a probate court hearing this week in a @entity58 courthouse across the street from federal court			0
the federal judge approved the request that he testify before the judge considering the permanent custody of his children and the control of his estate			2
. @entity11 prosecutors contend that @entity5 killed his wife by asphyxiating her in their room at the @entity68 on april 5 , 2010			1
@entity70 - @entity21 's lawyers accuse @entity11 investigators of rushing to judgment in charging the husband because they wanted to protect @entity9 's valuable tourist industry			1
the case is " replete with inconsistencies and unsupported innuendos , " attorney @entity75 said			0
the @entity9 trip was intended to help the couple work out their marital problems caused by the producer 's affair with another woman , his lawyers said			1
but prosecutors contend it was murder , not reconciliation , on @entity5 's mind			2
" the fugitive 's continued infidelity provides a strong motive for him to have committed the crime , " @entity18 prosecutors wrote in an extradition filing			0
" the fugitive 's affair was still an issue with the couple during their trip			0
" the fact that he brought their young son and daughter along supports his innocence , @entity75 said			0
" how absurd it is to think that our client , or anyone , would book a trip to @entity11 with his two minor children , have a room in which all of them , the whole family , is staying together , and have this with some motive to commit a homicide , " @entity75 said			2
" it makes no sense in logic , whatsoever			0
" prosecution documents describe a loud argument ending with a violent death in the same one - room hotel suite where the children were staying			0
while investigators have not talked to the children , a therapist who has helped them deal with the loss of their mother did question the daughter about her memories of the @entity11 trip , @entity75 said			2
an affidavit signed by the therapist said the girl told her she never heard her parents argue in @entity11 and that she was never left alone at the resort			1
" @entity140 and @entity141 did not yell at each other and never hit each other , " the statement quotes the daughter saying			0
" @entity140 and @entity141 never hit each other anywhere , anytime			0
