-- even though @entity2 is the most popular smartphone platform in the @entity3 , and even though there were 10 billion @entity2 app downloads as of december 2011 , many @entity2 users are frustrated that they 're still treated like a second - class app market			1
that 's because " fragmentation " makes it more complicated to develop @entity2 apps that will run on most @entity2 phones			1
new research from @entity13 claims that @entity2 fragmentation might be becoming less of a issue			1
if correct , this could start bringing more popular apps to @entity2 phones faster -- or maybe even first			0
but the catch is , the @entity2 ecosystem is far more variable than the @entity22 landscape			0
that makes it a bigger long - term risk for app developers			0
many popular consumer apps are still are rolled out first for the @entity22			0
( hello , @entity28 ? ) that 's because many @entity2 phones are running substantially older versions of @entity2 , which limits which apps they can support			2
plus , @entity2 phones come in a dizzying array of sizes , configurations , and capabilities -- compared to a fairly small selection of @entity22 models			0
also phone manufacturers and wireless carriers tend to customize the @entity2 interface ( in " flavors " such as @entity42 and @entity43 )			0
@entity13 provides analytics tools that app developers use to monitor how people use apps			2
@entity49 gathered from @entity13 users during two weeks in january indicate that most @entity2 phones now have " remarkably similar specifications			0
" @entity13 notes that this significantly simplifies the job of deploying mass market @entity2 apps			1
nearly three - fourths of @entity2 app usage came from devices running some version of @entity2 2.3 " @entity60			1
" that 's not the most recent version of @entity2 ( so far 4.0 " @entity67 " runs on only a handful of phones and tablets ) , but it 's robust enough to run the vast majority of @entity2 apps well			1
furthermore , @entity13 found that nearly all of the remaining @entity2 phones are running @entity2 2.2 " @entity2			2
" " between the two , @entity2 developers can be confident that they only need to actively target two @entity2 builds in order to achieve 96 % compatibility with the @entity2 ecosystem , " said the report			0
screen size and resolution are also key variables for creating @entity2 apps			1
according to @entity13 , just over 40 % of all instances of app usage ( " sessions " ) came from @entity2 devices with 4.3 - inch screens			1
four - inch screens accounted for a further 22 percent of sessions			0
and over 60 % of @entity2 app sessions came from phones with a screen resolution of 800 x 480 pixels -- such as @entity93 's popular @entity92 series of phones			1
what about tablets ? according to @entity13 , nearly three quarters of all @entity2 tablet usage comes from devices with nearly identical characteristics -- not surprising , since @entity103 's new @entity102 e-reader tablet is already the second most popular tablet in the world , behind the @entity106			1
@entity13 found that 74 % of @entity2 tablet usage takes place on devices with seven - inch screens with 1024 x 600 resolution			1
also , 71 % of @entity2 tablets are running gingerbread			0
however , @entity113 observed that the @entity13 numbers might be overly optimistic			0
also , as more @entity67 - capable devices hit the market this year , fragmentation could become a bigger problem again : " the best thing we can say about these numbers is that the @entity2 ecosystem is stable ... for now			2
in six months when there is a flood of @entity67 devices on the market , developers will be dealing with the need to support a vast number of @entity60 devices while also supporting the newest functions in @entity2 4.0.1			2
" the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity133 .			0

@entity13 claims that @entity2 fragmentation might be becoming less of a issue
