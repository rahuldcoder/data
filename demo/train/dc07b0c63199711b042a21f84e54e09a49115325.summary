@entity0 , @entity1 -- an earthquake in @entity1 , powerful enough to prompt the appearance of a small island off the coast , has killed at least 330 people , @entity1 officials said			1
the 7.7 - magnitude quake struck tuesday in a remote , sparsely populated area of southwestern @entity1 , but it had severe consequences			1
at least 330 people have lost their lives , a spokesman for the @entity13 said wednesday			1
in addition to the fatalities , 445 people were injured , he said			1
and more people are still feared to be trapped in wreckage			1
images from the scene showed some buildings reduced to rubble			2
" still , there are some areas that are not accessible , " a spokesman for the @entity25 told @entity2			1
" so that toll can be increased , " @entity28 said about the number of deaths			2
" when we reach all the areas , then there will be a clear picture			1
" rescue efforts are under way in the heavily hit districts of @entity39 and @entity40 in @entity42 province			1
but severely damaged communications networks are hindering the operation , said @entity45 , a spokesman for the provincial government			2
thousands of survivors from the earthquake are facing difficulties in the two districts , he added , saying that authorities have received offers of support from @entity54 and @entity55			1
the @entity1 military has deployed more than 1,000 troops to the affected area to help with rescue and relief efforts , some of them traveling in helicopters and others in convoy on mountain roads			1
about 10,000 food packs have been sent to the region			0
each pack can feed a family for 15 days			0
the troops are entering a difficult region			0
militants fighting for a separate state in @entity42 operate out of part of @entity39 district , which has been the site of bombings in the past			0
the remoteness of the area means that some of the injured are having to be airlifted to major cities such as @entity84 , the capital of @entity42 , and @entity86 , the capital of neighboring @entity89 province			2
measuring the magnitude of earthquakes @entity92 emerges the quake was strong enough to cause a mass 20 to 30 feet high to emerge from the @entity96 like a small mountain island off the coast of @entity99 , local police official @entity93 said			1
a large number of people gathered to view the newly formed island , he said			1
large quakes can cause significant deformation to the earth 's crust , particularly visible along coastlines			0
the island is about 100 feet in diameter and about one mile off the coast , @entity108 reported			2
@entity112 , principal seismologist for the @entity113 , confirmed the island had formed			2
he said it was " not surprising , " considering the magnitude of the earthquake			0
but @entity118 , a geophysicist with the @entity119 , said that generally it would be unlikely for a large island to emerge from such a quake as tuesday 's			2
many things , such as the tide , could come into play regarding the rise of the island , he said			0
with a depth of about nine miles ( about 15 kilometers ) , the quake struck 43 miles ( 69 kilometers ) northeast of @entity39 and 71 miles ( 114 kilometers ) northwest of @entity130 , the @entity119 said			0
the tremors lasted two minutes			0
people flocked out onto the streets of @entity84			0
aftershocks could be felt in @entity86 , hundreds of miles to the southeast			0
@entity2 's @entity136 and journalist @entity137 reported from @entity1			0
@entity2 's @entity138 and @entity139 also contributed to this report .			0

rescue efforts are under way with people still feared trapped under rubble
