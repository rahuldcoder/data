@entity0 -- it 's hip to be @entity3			1
i was on a call the other day with someone who joked that she wanted to be named an " honorary " @entity3 because " that 's the cool group right now			1
" the @entity8 found that there are about 52 million hispanics in the @entity11			2
they 're everywhere , in all 50 states			2
and they 're shaping how @entity11 think about sports , fashion , food , entertainment , music , pop culture , business , media , the arts and the digital world			2
@entity11 's largest minority is especially cool this time of year			0
in 1988 , when @entity26 established @entity27 , from september 15 to october 15 , lawmakers no doubt intended for @entity11 to reflect on the past			1
but somewhere along the line , it became a time to look to the future			0
the original idea was to celebrate what @entity10 have contributed to this magnificent country , and all that they have sacrificed , dating back at least to 1863 , when @entity35 of the @entity36 became the first @entity3 recipient of the @entity38 , for heroism at @entity40 during the @entity41			1
to date , the @entity38 has been awarded to 44 men of @entity3 heritage , and in 25 of those cases -- more than half -- it was presented posthumously			1
but today , @entity27 is mostly about looking forward and pondering the impact that @entity10 are going to continue to have on this country for as far as the eye can see			1
in business , companies spend enormous amounts of money hoping for a slice of the $ 1.2 trillion that @entity10 spend annually on goods and services			1
in politics , many of what analysts call " battleground states " are heavily populated by @entity10			1
@entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 mattered a lot on election night 2012 , and they 'll matter more in the years to come			2
@entity10 make up 16 % of the @entity11 population , and it 's estimated they 'll account for 29 % by 2050			1
about the same time , whites will cease to be a statistical majority in the @entity11			0
what does this all mean anyway ? opinion : @entity73 , do n't give up on attracting @entity10 support @entity10 have put all their eggs in the basket of changing demographics			1
they 've assumed that , as their numbers grow , they 'll automatically become powerful , influential and prosperous			1
the other day , i was on a panel where a university professor suggested that the best hope for immigration reform was for @entity11 to get to the point where @entity10 represented so much of the electorate that no politician would dare cross them			1
alas , it does n't work that way			0
in fact , as the @entity3 population grows in the years to come , we can expect many non-hispanics to panic and batten down the hatches			2
for instance , even though most hispanics in the @entity11 are @entity11 - born citizens , you 'll see more @entity98 - style immigration laws intended to put immigrants in their place			2
and often , those laws will wind up also victimizing those @entity11 citizens who simply resemble immigrants			0
this year , to mark @entity27 , i thought that i 'd give my compadres something they could really use : a reality check			1
for most hispanics in the @entity11 , life is not a fiesta			1
they 're actually quite bleak			0
and demographic trends being what they are , that 's bad news for the whole country			0
according to a 2011 study by the @entity120 , the median wealth -- assets minus debts -- of @entity3 households fell by 66 % from 2005 to 2009			1
over the same period , the median wealth of white households fell by just 16 %			1
as a result , the study found , the median net worth of white households is now 18 times that of @entity3 households			1
it 's true that some of the nation 's corporations are making a play for @entity3 customers , but not many of their top executives and board members are @entity3			2
closer look : hispanics in the @entity11 and how are lower - level @entity3 workers treated at these companies ? at a @entity145 distribution center in @entity146 , @entity147 , three former employees are suing the company for discrimination and retaliation			1
the lawsuit claims that white managers used ethnic slurs and that when the workers complained , they were fired			0
it also brought to light a " training document " that used negative stereotypes to advise managers about how to deal with @entity3 workers , including this : " food : not everyone eats tacos and burritos ; music : not everyone dances to salsa ; dress : not everyone wears a sombrero ; @entity173 ( lower education level , some may be undocumented )			2
" you get the idea			0
@entity177 , a @entity145 spokeswoman , said in a statement that while she could n't comment on specific allegations , the company does n't " tolerate or condone discrimination in any form			0
" @entity177 said that the guide was n't part of any " formal or company - wide training " and that it is " not representative of who @entity145 is			0
" she also apologized for its content			0
it 's true that @entity10 are now able to help decide elections , and that they 're courted by both parties			1
yet @entity10 are treated disrespectfully by both the @entity195 who take them for granted , and the @entity73 who write them off			2
they 're often insulted , deceived , manipulated , and exploited			0
it 's shoddy customer service			0
things need to get better for this population			0
but it wo n't occur organically			0
there is no magic tipping point			0
things are not going to just start happening for hispanics when they get to a certain percentage of the population			0
they have to make them happen			0
hispanics already know how to work hard , sacrifice everything , and believe in the @entity11 dream			0
now they need to know what they 're worth , refuse to settle for less , and accept that only they can make dreams come true			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			2

@entity27 , established in 1988 , runs from september 15 to october 15
@entity221 : hispanics ca n't assume they 'll be better off as their numbers grow
he says the reality is that life is not a fiesta ; median wealth of @entity3 households has fallen
@entity221 : @entity10 need to know what they 're worth and refuse to settle for less
