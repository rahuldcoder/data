-- my marriage ended in 1995 after 23 years			2
my two daughters were adults			2
i knew i would be required to pay alimony , split the assets and provide health insurance for a reasonable period of time			1
but a marriage that had been difficult for many years was finally over , or so i thought			0
i did n't know i was about to enter the twilight zone of alimony - without - end in @entity12			1
the trial took three days , and a judgment took 10 months			0
my legal bills were nearly $ 150,000			0
i was ordered to pay $ 865 a week -- forever			1
after 9/11 , my business suffered , as many did , and i could not afford the payments			1
i racked up credit card debt that terrified me			0
i had to file for bankruptcy			0
when i went to court to modify the alimony payment , the judge recused herself from the case , saying her husband had once played cards with the bankruptcy trustee , and i would have to start over			1
something was very wrong , and i had to fix it			0
i launched a website , @entity30 , and with my current wife , @entity32 , and several couples in similar situations , began what became the alimony reform movement			1
at that time , i did n't know it was common for ex-wives to go back to court when a former spouse got married and get an increase in alimony if the new wife added income to the marriage			1
i also discovered that the lower - earning spouse needed to be supported to the standard of the lifestyle of the marriage -- and that judges could not put an end date to alimony , even for short - term marriages			1
all alimony was for life			1
payers did not have the right to retire			0
@entity32 , who was divorced in @entity58 after a 23 - year marriage , was told she would get only three years of maintenance			0
while married to me in @entity12 , she was forced to contribute income to supplement my payments to my ex-wife , or i would go to jail			1
she took on a second job			0
despite scant media attention , our organization began to grow			0
horror stories like mine were coming in daily , and people from all over the country began to join mar. a major turning point came when the @entity73 ran an article that described @entity12 ' alimony law			1
that day , many women about to marry men who paid alimony called to say they were canceling their weddings			1
the @entity80 , headed by @entity81 , was born			0
@entity12 rep. @entity82 advised me that legislators only acted during " trouble in their village			0
" we spent many months teaching those villagers who were suffering under the law how to persuade legislators to support the cause			1
in 2009 , after several attempts to pass reform , the @entity12 judiciary chairmen created the @entity96			2
members included the @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 of @entity102 , the chief justice of probate and me , the only nonlawyer			0
i provided descriptions of the problems and the lawyers provided the solutions			0
the chairs of the task force , sen. @entity112 and rep. @entity113 , approved the bill , and it was passed unanimously in the @entity115 and @entity116			0
it was signed by gov. @entity118 on september 26 , 2011 , and went into effect on march 1			0
click here for the opposite view : why the new law is bad for women the new law provides guidelines and structure , consistency and predictability			1
it provides reasonable terms of alimony to help lower - earning former spouses adjust and return to the job market or live on their alimony , marital assets , @entity135 and pensions from the marriage			1
it suspends , reduces or terminates alimony if a recipient spouse is co-habitating			2
payers ' alimony obligation ends when they reach full retirement age , as defined by the @entity135			2
this allows a payer and payee to plan for retirement because they know ahead of time that it will end			1
there are guidelines for how long alimony must be paid based on the length of the marriage			1
since the law was signed , i have had calls about payers ' ex-spouses getting married			2
long - time alimony payers are finally free			1
receiving spouses are going back to work			0
what was once an entitlement is now based on need and ability to pay			2
judges have guidance they have been asking for and are happy to have			0
attorneys can solve cases that went on forever , and @entity12 residents are no longer afraid to get married for fear of unending litigation in case the marriage fails			0
no matter where you live in @entity12 , the result will be the same			0
the mission i began is now spreading to many states all over the country			2
i have been consulting with divorce reform activists in @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191			2
people need to be self - supporting after a term of alimony and not rely an ex-spouse			2
alimony is support payment from a spouse , who has the ability to pay , to a spouse in need , for a reasonable length of time			1
that needs to be the rule , not the exception			0
in @entity12 , it is the law			2
now it is the duty of legislators in other states to listen to victims of ruinous alimony laws and do the same			1
join us on @entity215 / @entity214			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			1

@entity218 worked to reform state alimony law after he went bankrupt trying to pay
he *remarried* and some of his second wife **'s** income went to @entity218 **'s** alimony payments
@entity218 : new law has guidelines and sets reasonable length of time for payments
he says many states are considering new laws that do n't financially ruin the payer
