" @entity0 would like to clarify that it was not mr. @entity2 's , nor @entity0 's , intent to cause offense to the @entity5 people , and [ @entity0 ] would apologize to anyone who has interpreted the comments in this way			1
" @entity0 is a network that reports the news in an objective and balanced fashion			0
however , as part of our coverage we also employ commentators who provide robust opinions that generate debate			0
" on this occasion @entity2 was offering his strongly held opinion of the @entity5 government , not the @entity5 people --- a point he subsequently clarified on @entity34 on april 14			1
" it should be noted that over many years , @entity2 has expressed critical comments on many governments , including the @entity59 government and its leaders			2
" @entity2 , who appears daily on @entity0 's " @entity34 , " made the remarks as host @entity62 was comparing today 's @entity5 to that of 20 or 30 years ago			1
" i do n't know if @entity5 is any different , but our relationship with @entity5 is certainly different , " @entity2 said			2
" we 're in hock to the @entity5 up to our eyeballs because of the war in @entity69 , for one thing			0
they 're holding hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our paper			0
we are also running hundreds of billions of dollars ' worth of trade deficits with them , as we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food and export , you know , jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the stuff that we 're buying from @entity88			0
" so i think our relationship with @entity5 has certainly changed , " he said			0
" i think they 're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they 've been for the last 50 years			0
" he issued a clarification of his remarks on monday 's " @entity34 , " saying that by " goons and thugs , " he meant the @entity5 government , not the @entity5 people			1
it was unclear whether @entity5 's @entity10 was aware of the clarification when it held the tuesday news conference			0

" according to its web site , the nonprofit group is based in @entity115 , @entity116 , and was founded in 2007 as an organization " dedicated to the social well - being of employment - based immigrant professionals			0
" the state - run @entity121 - language newspaper @entity120 also said in an editorial tuesday that an apology is called for , calling @entity2 " pathetic " and noting , " it is rare for the world audience to hear such a blatant discrimination against an ethnic group of people with such a derogatory connotation			2
