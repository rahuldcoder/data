-- it 's the stuff of urban legend that @entity3 in the 1960s spent hundreds of thousands developing a ballpoint pen that could operate in zero gravity while the cash - strapped @entity8 space program resorted to a cheaper and more elegant solution -- the pencil			1
as with most urban legends , the truth is slightly more complicated - @entity3 was justifiably nervous about allowing astronauts crumbly and combustible objects such as pencils after the fatal apollo 1 fire in 1967 -- but it illustrates the important role culture plays in developing space missions			2
@entity21 -- the latest player on the deep space block -- is no exception			1
at @entity29 's @entity28 , professor @entity25 , the associate head of the department of industrial and systems engineering , has designed high - precision space tools mimicking chopsticks and @entity21 ceramic soup spoons			1
with space programs and technology often shrouded in secrecy , it 's not surprising that professor @entity25 has had to find unique solutions to the technical problems of operating in an environment as hostile as the moon			1
timeline : @entity21 's race into space " our technology is different , " professor @entity25 told @entity0			1
" there 's nothing in our engineering where we can make use of another 's design			0
" he said that the complexity of space missions is such that each one is like a fingerprint -- no two are the same -- and the engineering must respond to a unique set of problems			0
" when you are talking about a space mission , you have to consider all the eventual possibilities , so all our designs have a number of alternatives -- if one part does n't work then another part can replace it			1
" for the @entity71 's @entity70 he designed the @entity72 which drills the sample and then , by simply reversing the mechanism , picks up the core like a pair of chopsticks			0
his digger based on a @entity21 soup spoon has the heat - resistant qualities of ceramics and the ability to operate in a deep hole in much the same way that a @entity21 soup spoon operates better in a rice bowl than a flat metal western spoon			1
he 's currently working on a camera pointing system that will track the descent and operation of the working robot on the @entity21 moon mission aboard @entity94			1
as with all equipment on moon missions , it must meet a stringent series of tests			0
not only must it be able to operate in extreme temperatures and in a vacuum , it must offer the greatest strength and versatility for the least payload and have the ability to fix problems if something goes wrong			0
with the moon 380,000 kilometers away , @entity25 says there 's little margin for error			1
" it 's such a long way away , " says @entity25 , laughing			2
" if you look at the @entity3 missions they often put down two landers at the same time , just to minimize the risk			0
" quality control is very stringent in the @entity21 missions -- i think that this has been the problem that has plagued the @entity125 missions recently			2
" millions of things can go wrong and one small thing can affect the whole mission			0
on the @entity125 missions it was the integrated circuits -- there are thousands of electronic components on a space mission			2
you only need one of them to go wrong to go off course			0
" @entity137 secret base fuels @entity21 's space ambitions in the 1960s , more than one - third of the missions failed , he said			1
while the odds have improved since then -- and the @entity21 have the luxury of learning from the mistakes of the space pioneers at @entity3 and the @entity125 programs -- he said launch time is always especially tense for the designers and engineers in @entity29			1
" say with communications , for instance , it 's very simple -- if the antenna is not pointing towards earth you wo n't get a signal , " he said			2
" you have to take into consideration factors you could n't possibly imagine			0
" @entity25 's team even have to gauge the minute amount of vapor released by the metals used in the instruments to make sure that , not only do the gases not contaminate the moon samples , they do n't mask the work of other delicate instruments on the mission			1
essential to this work is what he calls " space qualifications " ; the experience that allows you to anticipate various problems and overcome them			0
his space qualifications have led him to develop unique precision instruments such as a grinder that not only pulverizes samples of space rock , but sieves them too -- all in zero gravity and all in a vacuum			2
" this was a difficult problem to resolve -- normally you need gravity to sieve anything , " he said , explaining that the machine packed the sample into a puck before forcing it through the sieve			0
while luck sometimes plays a role amid the nail - biting uncertainties involved in a space mission , @entity25 admits that money often maximizes the luck needed for a lunar landing			1
@entity21 's estimated space budget is around us $ 2bn a year -- not even a tenth of the budget that @entity3 receives			1
given these restraints , he says the @entity21 program has a very exacting space culture but is in no hurry , preferring to chase quality rather than simply notch up runs on the board			2
" the @entity21 want to see very clear results , " he said , adding that , having worked with the @entity125 and @entity211 space programs , @entity21 's space program offered an interesting point of comparison			1
" i 've collaborated with the @entity211 , with the @entity125 and with the @entity21 and all of them have different cultures , " @entity25 said			1
" the @entity211 discuss things for a long time and there are a lot of changes because there are different nations involved and they have different ideas and it slows things down even to the point of not taking off at all			0
" the @entity125 think they have a lot of experience but a lot of this experience is now dated			0
i think they have to realize that , " he said			0
" the @entity233 have too many vested interests with commerce in space exploration			0
" as for the moon , he said there was still much work to be done in examining samples , in particular the remote possibility that deposits of @entity243 -- believed to be in greater concentration on the moon -- could one day power nuclear fusion power plants on earth			0
@entity21 scientists are also anxiously awaiting their very own fresh samples of moon rock			2
" i think from all the @entity3 missions to the moon , @entity21 has just one gram of moon dust to study , " he told @entity0 .			0

@entity29 's professor @entity25 designs high - precision space tools
one instrument uses a machine with chopstick - like *pincers* to extract samples
another instrument uses the heat - resistant qualities of a @entity21 soup spoon to take samples
a camera pointing system will work alongside robots on @entity21 's lunar mission
