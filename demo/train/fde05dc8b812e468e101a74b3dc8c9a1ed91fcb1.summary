-- @entity1 and @entity2 were ordered friday to stand off in court once again after a federal judge struck more than $ 450 million that a jury last august ordered @entity1 to pay @entity2			1
" some of the awards rested on impermissible legal theories , " @entity7 district judge @entity6 wrote in her ruling			1
the jury had awarded @entity2 more than $ 1 billion in damages total after finding @entity1 had copied both the design and software features of the @entity14			1
the new " trial on damages " affects the formula , and thus the amount , that @entity1 must pay to @entity2			2
it will focus on several @entity1 products specifically , after @entity21 questioned the damages ordered because of them			0
they are the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , replenish and @entity36			0
@entity2 vs. @entity1 : a peace treaty just under $ 600 million of the earlier award to @entity2 involving other @entity1 products still stands , according to @entity21			1
@entity1 , which recently logged record - breaking sales of its latest @entity28 phone , is locked in a tight race with @entity2 to see who will dominate the @entity7 smartphone market			2
that rivalry has spilled out into court on multiple occasions			0
last summer , a @entity49 court found that both parties had infringed on each other 's patents , banning the sale of the @entity54 , @entity14 4 , two @entity56 models and @entity1 's @entity57			2
yet the damages ordered in that case paled compared to those at stake when the two tech giants faced off last year in a @entity7 federal court in @entity64			0
@entity2 accused @entity1 of copying the design of the @entity14 and @entity56 , suing @entity1 for $ 2.5 billion			1
@entity1 countersued @entity2 for $ 519 million , also for patent infringement			2
patent battle continues after sifting through 109 pages of jury instructions and their notes and memories from weeks of testimony , a nine - person jury found @entity1 was guilty of " willful " violations of a number of @entity2 's patents and recommended that @entity2 get more than $ 1 billion in compensation			1
the jury did not recommend awarding @entity1 any money in its counterclaims			0
" this is a huge win for @entity2 , " @entity80 , a @entity81 law professor , said then			0
the award " is just large enough to make it the largest surviving patent verdict in history			0
" in december , judge @entity21 issued a ruling denying @entity1 's request for a new trial based on the company 's claim the jury foreman , @entity92 , was prejudiced against the company because he had been sued by @entity94 , his former employer			1
@entity1 became the largest investor in @entity94 after selling a division to the hard - drive maker in 2011 .			0

a jury last august ordered @entity1 to pay @entity2 pay more than $ 1 billion
jurors determined @entity1 copied the @entity14 's design and software
a judge now says over $ 450 million of that is based on " impermissible legal theories "
she orders a new trial on *key* aspects of the case ; $ 600 million of the award stands
