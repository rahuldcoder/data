-- @entity1 , track and swimming have been staples at the @entity5 for decades , drawing thousands of spectators			1
but solo synchronized swimming or live pigeon shooting ? they are among the strangest events that have , at one time or another , taken place at the @entity14			1
what to watch for at the @entity5 this year here are the 10 oddest sports that have graced the modern @entity5 -- some will feature at @entity18 over the coming weeks , some thankfully will not ... @entity20 @entity21 alert ! yes , this sport features one female swimmer synchronizing with herself			1
the sport made its debut in the @entity14 in 1984 , with @entity27 swimmer @entity26 winning the gold medal			2
similar to the group event , a swimmer performs a kind of water ballet			2
despite the seemingly misleading title , organizers of the sport say the swimmer is actually in sync with the music			2
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? no. but there will be the team synchronized swimming events that most people are familiar with			1
the solo event was discontinued after 1992			2
@entity47 @entity48 debuted in 1904			2
the athlete stands erect , holding clubs that resemble bowling pins in each hand			2
he then twirls and whirls them around			2
the more complicated the routine , the more points he wins			2
historians say the sport was the precursor to rhythmic gymnastic events that use ribbons and hoops			1
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? no. sadly			2
@entity48 was only in the @entity5 twice , ending in 1932			1
@entity65 once a very competitive @entity5 sport , tug of war employs teams that struggle and strain to pull a rope past a certain point			1
@entity72 actually won the most medals in this event , historians say			0
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? nope			0
tug - of - war was an @entity5 event until 1920 , and was then relegated to the church picnic circuit			1
live pigeon shooting the @entity81 in @entity82 had the great distinction of being the first games where women competed			0
it also wore the ignoble badge for this sport , where athletes aimed to bring down as many pigeons as possible			0
nearly 300 birds were slain , historians say , leaving a bloody , feathery mess			0
the winner shot down 21 pigeons			0
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? yes			0
the 1900 games in @entity82 was the only time pigeon killing was featured in the @entity5			1
4 billions reasons to watch the @entity5 swimming obstacle course as strange as this sport may seem , the obstacles swimmers had to overcome are even more unusual			1
in the @entity105 in @entity82 , swimmers crawled over boats , swam under them and climbed a pole -- all the while swimming 200 meters in the @entity110			0
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? no. the boats on the @entity114 are safe			0
@entity115 maybe if this was the 1970s and there was a disco ball , this sport would have taken off			0
@entity115 debuted at the 1992 @entity119			0
the game follows the rules of ice hockey , but with roller skates			0
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? no. the @entity119 was the only time @entity115 was in the @entity5			1
@entity129 ok , think fencing			1
now take away the saber and replace it with a cane			0
you know , the walking stick type of thing ? voila , now you have the @entity137 martial art @entity129 , that debuted at the @entity138			1
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? no , but you can watch the fencing events and image how much more awesome it would be with wooden canes			1
rope climbing yes , the activity that made you feel like a weakling in your physical education class debuted as an @entity5 sport in 1896			1
just like in your gym class , climbers are timed to see how quickly they can shimmy up a braided rope			1
but unlike your classmates , these athletes did n't run out of steam before reaching the top			0
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? no. after 1932 , the @entity5 thankfully left rope climbing behind			1
kind of like you did after high school			0
@entity161 despite seeming like an activity you did in your backyard when you were 10 , trampoline debuted as an @entity5 sport in 2000			1
gymnasts take to the trampoline , somersaulting and flipping as stern - faced judges keep score			0
" @entity172 technique and perfect body control are vital for success , with judges delivering marks for difficulty , execution and time of flight , minus penalties , " @entity5 officials say			1
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? yes			0
both men and women trampolinists ( yes , that is a word ) will compete in @entity41			0
race walking in this sport , competitors try to outrace one another -- without actually running			2
huh ? even though the premise seems a little goofy , race walking has actually been an @entity5 sport since 1904			1
to ensure that athletes do not run , race walkers must have one foot on the ground at all times or risk disqualification			0
the result ? a distinctive sashay that elicits many a giggle			0
will we see this sport in @entity41 ? yes			0
men will compete in 20 - kilometer and 50 - kilometer races ; women in 20 kilometers			0
@entity204 , set , sashay ! @entity5 mascots : cute or creepy ?			1
