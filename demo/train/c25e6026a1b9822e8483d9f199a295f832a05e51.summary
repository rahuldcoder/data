-- in the wake of the recent @entity4 " @entity3 that has been blazing a viral trail on @entity6 over the past 48 hours , i was asked to expand on our other operational policies at the theater			1
most of them go back to 1996 , when my wife and i were first getting into the business			1
despite the fact that we had zero experience in exhibition , we decided to quit our " real " jobs and open a movie theater			1
we had no desire to make movies , but we sure as heck loved to go to the cinema and watch them in the right environment			2
what drew us to open a theater in the first place is that we were finding a trip to the multiplex to be , more often than not , a disappointing experience			2
poor projection , bad sound and , worst of all , disrespectful patrons in the cinema were slowly eroding our fun , so we conceived of the idea of opening a cinema ourselves on our own terms			2
we could program the movies that we loved , create unique experiences around those movies and make sure people behaved appropriately			1
in the first couple of months of operation , we came up with some very simple guidelines that all of our theaters still adhere to today			2
they were all born from our own reactions to experiences we hated and endured when we went to the movies			1
the insistence on these simple policies is one of the main reasons people are loyal to our cinemas today			2
we also serve beer , and that helps			2
1 ) we do not play ads before the film			1
if i spend $ 9 or more to see a movie , i equate that to paying for premium cable			2
paying for the movie means you get to skip the ads. if the cinema model were similar to @entity70 , then sure , the ads are a means of paying for the screening of the film			1
the barrage of ads used to be annoying enough when they were just slides projected on the screen			1
now , with full audio and video , they are insufferable and should not be tolerated			1
at the @entity82 , instead of ads , we create customized video " preshow " content that is fun and entertaining and themed to the movie you are about to see			1
if there is ever an ad , it will be along the lines of a @entity93 @entity92 cologne ad from the 1970s , not a @entity94 with fake - rock jams enticing you to join the @entity97			0
our hope is that even if the movie you paid for is terrible , the preshow is awesome , you had an ice - cold beer and left happy			1
2 ) we do not allow children under 6			0
if the movie is a non-crossover kids movie , we sometimes flex this age down to 3 and up , and we also have select " @entity109 " screenings each week for infants and small children			0
if you want to take your 4 - year - old to see " @entity113 " at 10 p.m. , however , you 'll have to go somewhere else			0
3 ) we do not allow unaccompanied minors			1
there are of lots of great , well - behaved 12 - year - old individual kids , but assemble them in pods of four or more and drop them unaccompanied in a darkened theater , and they will pave a swath of destruction akin to feral hogs			0
we do n't allow it ever			0
minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian , and if they act up , they will be thrown out			1
4 ) if you persist in talking or texting , we will throw you out			0
after the past few days , i think i 've probably articulated our policy on this topic fully			0
if you talk or blatantly text , we will warn you to stop			0
if you persist , you will be asked to leave			0
these policies ( with the exception of the no - ads policy ) have the same underlying rationale			1
when you are in a cinema , you are one of many , many people in the auditorium			0
when the lights go dark and the movie begins , every single movie fan in the room wants to be absorbed into and get lost in the flickering images on the screen			0
a light from a cellphone , a screaming baby or a disruptive teen cracking jokes all pull you out of the magic of the movies			0
providing an awesome experience for true movie fans is the reason we opened the first @entity4 back in the mid- ' 90s , and it is the exact same philosophy we adhere to today .			0

at the @entity82 , instead of ads , we create customized video " preshow " content
minors must be accompanied by a parent or guardian
the rules were all born from our own reactions and experiences
