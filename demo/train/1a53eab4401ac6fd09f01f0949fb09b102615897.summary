-- @entity1 winning the all - around gymnastics gold medal in @entity4 is over-the - top significant on so many levels			1
it 's not only that she won the top prize in a dramatic and thrilling competition last week , featuring the top @entity11 gymnasts			0
more important is the powerful message @entity1 is sending to young girls and women , especially those who are african - american , about doing what it takes to make your dreams happen			1
young people need to reach for spectacular goals			1
this is not a message we hear often enough , and that is why is it so important			0
monday may have been not quite as golden a day for @entity1 -- she placed eighth in the women 's uneven bars final -- but the audience did not seem at all disappointed in her performance ; there was anticipation and excitement just to see her compete again			1
and it did nothing to diminish what she has accomplished ; with her all - around victory thursday , she created one of those iconic @entity42 moments that will endure the test of time			0
@entity1 became the best in her sport in front of the world , and was unapologetic about doing what it took to get her there			1
her family 's sacrifice , and the trust her mother showed in her daughter 's goals , could be a lesson to parents and children everywhere			1
the story of an @entity16 single mom and her daughter reaching for greatness , and succeeding , will resonate with a whole new generation			1
i have been an elite athlete , coached an @entity42 gymnast and since 1994 have provided free and low - cost gymnastics to over 10,000 young people in @entity70			1
i know the challenges of gymnastics , especially for minority families			0
top - level gymnastics takes an incredible sacrifice from an athlete and her family in endless practice time , constant travel and lots of money			2
the fact that @entity1 chose at age 14 to move halfway across the country to achieve her goal is a testament to her drive			2
it was a remarkable decision : according to research by the @entity92 , by age 14 , girls are dropping out of sports at twice the rate of boys			1
@entity1 has become a key role model who may help reverse this trend			2
it is important to not focus on the possible ways to make money from sport			0
it did not work that way for @entity1 ; the appeal of the journey to greatness was already there and it can not be underestimated			2
the reasons to participate in sport and fitness and the benefits ca n't be measured by dollars , unless you count how much it is costing this country to support a generation of overweight , unhealthy , unmotivated and unprepared - for - the - world young people			2
yes , we need @entity1			0
let 's face it , you can not take your eyes off her			0
when she is competing , her gymnastics is exciting			0
when she is being interviewed , her energy , love of her family , her sport and her faith together make a compelling impression			0
this is an exciting time for women 's gymnastics			0
but it is an even more exciting time for young girls -- all the girls who now have @entity1 to look up to			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			0

@entity140 : @entity1 gold medal for all - around gymnastics is *highly* significant
she says it sends a powerful message to young girls that they can seek spectacular goals
she -- and her single mom -- showed the world she was willing to sacrifice to get there
@entity140 : by 14 , girls drop sports at twice rate of boys . @entity1 's example could change that
