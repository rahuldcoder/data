@entity0 , the former @entity1 governor and vice presidential pick , is headed to @entity3 next month for a conservative gathering that will showcase no fewer than nine potential 2016 presidential contenders			1
she 's one of the confirmed speakers at the inaugural @entity7 , an event organized by @entity3 rep. @entity9 and conservative group @entity10 to " bring grassroots activists from across @entity3 to hear directly from national conservative leaders , " per its website			1
the event is scheduled for jan. 24			1
@entity0 raised eyebrows last @entity16 when she said she 'd " never say never " to a 2016 presidential run , and remains a star within the conservative wing of the @entity20 , but there 's little indication she 's moving forward with preparations for a bid			2
if she ran , she 'd face stiff competition for conservative support from a wide array of @entity20 , many of whom will join her at the @entity7			2
confirmed speakers for the event include @entity33 sen. @entity32 , former @entity35 gov. @entity34 , former @entity37 sen. @entity36 , @entity39 rep. @entity38 , former @entity41 ambassador @entity40 , physician @entity42 , former house speaker @entity43 and former @entity46 fundraiser @entity44 â€” all of whom are openly contemplating a presidential run or have n't ruled it out			1
@entity51 sen. @entity50 , the incoming chairman of the @entity52 , is also slated to speak			0
the event will give the potential contenders the opportunity to test the waters with @entity3 grassroots republicans , which are key to any conservative presidential contender 's chances			0
a strong showing in the @entity3 caucuses , the first contest of the presidential primary , signals to major donors and conservatives in other states that a candidate is a viable option for the nomination			0
notably missing from the first round of confirmed speakers is @entity72 sen. @entity71 , who has made no secret of his interest in running			0
his father , former @entity33 rep. @entity75 , posted a surprising third - place finish in the state 's caucuses in 2012 , but the @entity80 ' influence on the state has waned some in recent years .			0

the @entity7 is scheduled for jan. 24 , 2015
scheduled speakers include potential 2016 candidates to be the @entity46 nominee
