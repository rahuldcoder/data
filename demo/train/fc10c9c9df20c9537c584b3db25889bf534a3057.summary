@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 is a place that , for many , will always be associated with @entity4 -- the late drug lord who unleashed a murderous wave of violence and turned the @entity1 city into one of the world 's most dangerous			1
nearly 20 years after his death , the @entity0 that @entity4 and his infamous cartel once ruled has been transformed beyond recognition			1
in march , it was named the world 's most innovative city by the @entity17			1
" it 's a great opportunity to show the city we are building , " says mayor @entity18			1
" @entity0 has gone through really difficult times and people internationally have a reference to this pain			1
" " this designation as the most innovative city allows us to show the new face of @entity0 , which has a lot of challenges but which has come a long way			1
" visiting one poor hillside community in the city , the traditional chaotic construction of cheap housing associated with slums is still there			2
but now a gleaming seven - station outdoor escalator runs through the heart of the community			2
" i have a lot of fun , " says nine - year - old @entity42			2
" you can take it wherever you want to go and it helps bring up sick people			2
" the project took two years to complete , at a cost of $ 5 million			0
it replaced a 300 - step staircase , runs 18 hours a day , and has become a crucial link to the city center -- and the job market			2
" @entity0 has taken things which in themselves are not innovative , " explains @entity18			1
" but the way @entity0 has included them in urban and social development is the innovation			1
" this city 's infrastructure illustrates his point : for less than a dollar , citizens can ride the subway and then transfer directly to the @entity68 -- a vast cable car system which sweeps residents high into the city 's deprived areas			1
it stops in a mountaintop nature reserve , giving residents easy access to weekend recreation			0
the regeneration began under former mayor @entity79 , who pioneered a theory known as " urban acupuncture " from 2003 , which focused on reclaiming areas from the cartels through strategic projects			1
" @entity79 said his strategy was , for the first time , to put a lot of investment towards the most deprived areas , " says @entity86 architect @entity85			0
" before that politicians used to go there to get votes , promising many things and not go back			0
" @entity85 was a member of the team that redesigned the city 's urban landscape			1
one landmark project is the @entity100 -- a striking library built in an area where @entity4 used to recruit assassins			1
" we managed to bring into these low income settlements a high standard of architecture , " says @entity85			0
" so we managed to dignify these spaces			0
so everybody says : ' this is my library and i identify myself with that beautiful design			0
' " the overall aim was to create pride in each citizen 's neighborhood and the city itself			1
a scheme known as participatory budgeting -- where residents define local priorities -- remains central to its success			0
" one of the biggest things about @entity0 is pride and love towards the city , " says @entity18			1
" that pride needs to be nurtured ... how ? through civic participation			0
through citizens feeling they participate in the construction , design and approval of public works and government programs			0
" a level of civic pride is evident			0
many of the poor areas used to be strewn with rubbish and sewage			0
now , the streets are clean , with brightly - colored recycling bins featuring prominently			0
as the city looks to its future , the hillside communities , together with the majority of the city 's young people , are obvious areas of economic expansion			2
the mayor 's office has established small clinics to encourage " micro entrepreneurs " like @entity157 , who sells handicrafts			2
" i have learned a lot , like calculating costs and budgets , " she says			0
" and computers -- now i have a few ideas if one day i have to present my work as an entrepreneur			0
" @entity0 is by no means a perfect city : its murder rate has fallen by 80 % since the @entity4 days but it remains significant			1
and many still live in poverty			0
yet there is an undeniable sense of optimism and pride that the city seems to be on the right path through a commitment to innovation .			2
