-- @entity2 president @entity1 has revealed that he believes seven - time formula one world champion @entity3 will come out of retirement and join the new @entity7 team			1
the @entity8 has been a consultant with @entity2 , for whom he won five of his drivers ' crowns , since he ended his career in 2006			2
he almost got back behind the wheel for the @entity17 marque this year as a replacement for the injured @entity19 , but his comeback was cut short due to the lingering effects of a neck injury suffered in a motorbike accident			1
however , the 40 - year - old is now reportedly ready to return alongside compatriot @entity25 for 2010 with @entity8 manufacturer @entity7 , who took a controlling interest in 2009 's double world champions @entity28			1
@entity31 told reporters at @entity2 's @entity34 lunch in @entity35 that @entity3 was close to sealing a deal , the @entity30 @entity29 reported			1
" i had n't spoken to him since @entity38 but i spoke to him on wednesday , " @entity31 said			2
" he phoned me and he told me that there is a very , very , very strong possibility [ of joining @entity7 ]			2
" having said that , it is not 100 percent decided			0
but that is what he said			0
" @entity3 is poised to end a 13 - year association with @entity2 if he joins @entity7			1
" the real @entity3 , the one i know , will remain forever part of the @entity2 family , " @entity31 told @entity2 's official web site			1
" i said it in @entity50 and i repeated it in @entity38 , but , it seems he has a twin brother , identical in every way , who seems to have it in his head to go and race in @entity58 with @entity7			2
" i do n't know him personally , but it seems we have nothing to offer him -- we have two young drivers in @entity19 and @entity64 , on whom we are counting to deliver a lot next year			0
" i think that , this summer , when i asked him to stand in for @entity19 , after the terrible accident in @entity69 , he suddenly rediscovered the desire to race and the fact he was unable to follow through with that , left him a void that we are unable to fill			0
" i remember how despondent he sounded on the evening of august 9 , when he called me to say that the problem with his neck meant he could not race in @entity76			0
" we have tried to move forward with the idea of running a third car , but for the moment , that is not possible			0
i do n't know what he will decide for the future , but i extend to him , and indeed his twin brother , my very best wishes			0
