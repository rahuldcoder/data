@entity0 -- the ship carrying the remains of victims and wreckage from the @entity0 @entity7 447 crash arrived in @entity8 on thursday morning with around 104 bodies on board , according to @entity8 police sources			1
a @entity8 police spokesman said " it is very difficult to give an exact number of bodies , but we believe there to be around 104			1
" @entity18 crashed two years ago close to the coast of @entity20 , killing all on board			2
the @entity22 , the cable ship chartered by @entity8 investigation body the @entity25 , docked at the port of @entity27 for unloading			1
all access to the port was blocked by police for the sake of discretion for the families of the victims			1
dr. @entity36 , father of a @entity38 victim , said , " they showed us pictures of freezing containers , saying this is how the remains were transported			1
i think it 's right that the families were not present at the port today			2
" once the unloading procedure has been completed , the remains will be sent to the forensic institute in @entity0 for autopsy and identification			1
debris from the aircraft will be sent to a hangar in @entity55 for technical analysis			0
colonel @entity58 , head of the @entity59 of @entity8 national police told @entity8 press that identification would be made in two stages , ante mortem and post mortem , through the use of medical records , dental records , comparison with dna of relatives , and identification of jewellery			1
he also described the state of the bodies : " these bodies have been damaged by the shock of the crash			1
and then nature does the job , obviously			0
the temperature at 2 - 3 Â° and the almost total lack of oxygen slowed the deterioration process , but after two years , the bodies are inevitably damaged			1
" @entity36 told @entity1 that he had been in @entity0 wednesday with other victim 's families			0
" they explained to us that they would start identifying the remains recovered in contrast to what we were told a couple of weeks ago that the bodies could be identified by photos or clothes , " he said			1
" it turns out it 's really just a case of remains being identified by @entity68			1
we are afraid that not much remains			2
" when we were first told that the bodies could be identified by looking at them i thought ... it 's brilliant			2
with the way thing are now , i have changed my mind			0
they died all together at this particular spot and we should have left them there			0
" no exact time frame has been given for the process			2
@entity58 told @entity8 media , " it will take time			1
to give you an idea , identifying the first 50 bodies , two years ago , had taken two months of work			2
for 104 new bodies , up to 40 people will be mobilized for several weeks			1
" @entity36 described the reaction of two @entity8 victims ' relatives at the meeting held for victims relatives			1
" they were very emotional at this point			0
they asked if it could be arranged for all the relatives to get the results at the same time , so that some would n't be waiting whilst others had results			0
this was denied by representatives			0
they said this is the order we have for the investigation			0
when we have results we have to contact families , " he said			0
" the victims ' families will just have to sit and wait			2
this was very painful to hear			0
" operations onboard the @entity22 came to an end on june 3			0
a total of 154 bodies have now been brought up , however this still leaves more than 70 which will never be recovered			2
@entity36 explained , " difficult days begin now			0
some families will have hope ; will be in this situation of waiting for the next months			0
some will have an answer while others will never know			0
