@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 declared thursday that the @entity4 will take an expanded role in shaping the @entity6 , with an increased military presence one step of that policy			1
" our enduring interests in the region demand our enduring presence in this region , " @entity3 said in a speech to the @entity1 @entity11			2
" the @entity4 is a @entity18 power , and we are here to stay			1
" on wednesday , his government announced an agreement with @entity1 that will expand military cooperation between the longtime allies and boost @entity4 's presence in the region			1
in thursday 's speech , @entity3 made clear that the military expansion is a top priority in the wake of the @entity31 and @entity32 wars , even as the @entity4 faces the need to reduce mounting federal deficits and debt			1
" as we end today 's wars , i have directed my national security team to make our presence and missions in the @entity18 a top priority , " @entity3 said			1
" as a result , reductions in @entity4 defense spending will not -- i repeat , will not -- come at the expense of the @entity18			2
" the speech on the second day of his two - day trip to @entity1 , @entity3 's first as president , signaled a policy objective to compete head - on with @entity51 for influence in the region while also providing security assurances for allies			1
deputy national security adviser @entity56 told reporters that the policy comes in part from nations of the region seeking increased @entity4 presence			0
" the ability of the @entity4 to help respond to contingencies is something that has been welcomed in recent years , whether , again , it was work that we 're doing in the @entity69 to counter violent extremism , work that we 're doing to counter piracy in the region , the response to the tsunami in @entity75 , " @entity56 said			2
" so in other words , there 's a demand signal from the nations of the region , and this is something that we 're doing in concert with one of our closest allies			0
so we believe it 's not just entirely appropriate , but an important step to dealing with the challenges of the future of the @entity18			0
" under the military agreement announced wednesday , up to 250 @entity4 @entity87 will be sent to @entity89 and the northern region of @entity1 for military exercises and training			1
over the next several years their numbers are expected to climb to 2,500 -- a full @entity87 ground task force			0
in addition , air force maj. gen. @entity95 , director of strategic planning and policy for the @entity98 , told journalists in a telephone call wednesday from @entity102 that the @entity4 has based some of its most sophisticated weapons in the @entity18 , including squadrons of f - 22 fighters and c - 17 transport planes			2
the f - 22s provide leading - edge technology for potential air - to - air combat as well as cyber- and electronic warfare , " @entity95 said			0
they replaced older f - 15s , he added			0
@entity95 details @entity4 military power in @entity18 while @entity4 officials cited the need to respond to regional natural disasters as a reason for the agreement , concern over @entity51 's military expansion is widely acknowledged as a driving factor			1
" what we look at is how does our general force posture allow us to protect @entity4 interests , protect our allies , and ... secure the region broadly , " @entity56 said			0
" @entity51 is obviously a piece of the @entity18 , an emerging power			2
" @entity56 later added that the deal is " part of the @entity4 sending a signal that we 're going to be present , that we 're going to continue to play the role of underpinning security in this part of the region			0
part of that context is a rising @entity51			0
" in @entity51 , a foreign ministry spokesman questioned the appropriateness of an increased @entity4 military presence in @entity1			1
analysts note that the deal sends a message to @entity51 in a less confrontational way than building up bases closer to @entity51 shores			2
" the @entity51 can squawk about it , " said @entity151 , senior director of the @entity152 at the @entity153			0
" but it 's not like having an aircraft carrier in the @entity157			0
" @entity3 himself , however , insisted during a wednesday news conference that " the notion that we fear @entity51 is mistaken			0
" the president 's @entity1 visit -- postponed twice in 2009 and 2010 due to the massive oil spill in the @entity165 and other domestic political considerations -- highlights a changing balance of power in the @entity18 as @entity51 expands its military reach and the @entity4 works to reduce its military footprint in @entity170			1
@entity3 's @entity1 visit comes on the heels of last weekend 's 19 - nation @entity174 summit , which highlighted the need for new measures supporting job growth			2
during the @entity180 summit , @entity3 stressed the importance of the @entity18 to global economic security , and he pushed @entity51 to do more to help strengthen the world economy			1
after wrapping up his visit to @entity1 , @entity3 will conclude his @entity18 trip with a stop in @entity75 -- a country he spent several years living in during his childhood			1
@entity2 's @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report			0

@entity194 : " the @entity4 is a @entity18 power , " @entity3 says in @entity1
up to 2,500 @entity4 @entity87 will be *deployed* near @entity89
deal with @entity1 sends a message in light of @entity51 's growing military power
