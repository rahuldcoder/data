-- this is it : the night that @entity3 fans have waited for since 1998 , when the group was first eligible to be inducted into the @entity5			1
thursday night , the @entity7 trio -- a staple of classic rock radio stations -- will jam onstage with their fellow class of inductees			2
we should feel vindicated , right ? for the last 13 years , fans of the band have been outraged as the @entity16 overlooked their heroes			1
from the moment rush was eligible for consideration , fans signed petitions and wondered what kind of critics could be keeping their heroes from the limelight			2
even now , fans still feel slighted			2
you see , these are fans who are used to explaining -- and being summarily dismissed for -- their love of the band , said " @entity3 : beyond the lighted stage " documentarians @entity32 and @entity31			1
@entity3 has been a band almost 40 years			1
their music has encompassed genres ranging from heavy metal to new age			2
they even penned a rap once ( and caught a lot of flak for it from fans , too			2
) despite selling millions of records and achieving top - of - their - field musicianship , they 've never really had the respect of music critics			2
by extension , neither have their fans			2
" i remember reading once ( @entity3 drummer and lyricist ) @entity54 got voted one of the worst lyricists of all time , " @entity32 said			1
" and i ca n't imagine the rage that that would inspire in a lot of fans , " he said			2
@entity54 's lyrics are a major reason fans cite interest in the band 's music , he said			1
they identify and connect with @entity54 's words so personally , " i absolutely think it 's ' by attacking @entity3 , you 're attacking us , ' " @entity32 said			1
" and it 's war			2
" likewise , @entity75 's vocals are an unavoidable hurdle to rush appreciation , which fans are well aware of			2
his singing voice is highly pitched , in the tradition of singers like @entity82 or @entity83 , but in an extreme			2
" i think one critic said it sounded like a hamster in a blender , " @entity31 said			2
when they were working on the documentary and discussed with people in the industry what they were doing , people would tell him , " oh , i detest @entity3			1
i can not stand @entity75 's voice			2
" he 's heard that before			0
he knows @entity75 's singing has a polarizing effect on people			0
but if you love it , you love it for life , he said , and you do n't mind that it 's complex , nerdy music			2
at their core , @entity3 is a trio of outsiders			1
they grew up in suburban @entity7 , where guitarist @entity108 and bassist and singer @entity75 were both first - generation @entity7 from immigrant families , doing the best they could to avoid being the target of bullies			0
they did n't graduate from high school			0
and although they forged a career as one of the best - selling rock bands in history , the only thing rock ' n ' roll about them is their music -- no drug overdoses , no sex scandals , no trashing of hotel rooms			0
musicologist , author and @entity3 researcher @entity125 said fans deeply identify with the band because of that nonconformity			1
while the first wave of @entity3 fans in the 1970s were seen as a homogenous audience of jean - jacket - wearing , frowning boys , it soon became obvious that the fan base was far more diverse			1
@entity3 was dismissed by critics for their complicated songs and epically tackling fantasy and sci - fi topics in their lyrics			1
according to @entity125 , those same qualities won them the attention of a nontraditional fan base , people who loved @entity146			0
" @entity3 did n't always go after the pop culture cliches , " @entity125 said			1
" the songs were sometimes very long , the song topics were sometimes overwrought			0
they would have songs that quoted @entity152 , songs with a science fiction theme , an album that drew ideas from @entity156 , " he said			0
" who 's going to be interested in something like that ? it 's going to be some of the people in the @entity162			0
" that 's why 43 - year - old web developer and proprietor of @entity3 is a @entity166 likes them			1
he 's the first to admit you can " count the number of @entity3 love songs on one hand			1
" like many fans who were exposed to the music of @entity3 before 1980 , ( including @entity31 ) he was ushered into the fandom by an older brother			1
" when ' 2112 ' came out , he was 14 and the time and i was 6 , " @entity166 said			0
" @entity3 was the background noise to my youth			1
" and once his older brother went to college , it was easy to dig up old @entity183 and cassettes			0
the science fiction - evoking titles caught his eye first			0
then he noticed " 2112 " was a 20 - minute song			0
" i was like , what ? ! " @entity166 said , " a song ca n't be 20 minutes long ! " so he listened , and the story of the lyrics and @entity75 's emotional delivery hooked him			0
he 's been a @entity3 fan ever since			1
the defining moment of his fandom was when @entity3 played the entirety of " 2112 " in 1996 at @entity197 's @entity196			1
the @entity3 fandom has many social divisions			1
as @entity32 and @entity31 showed in their documentary , some people -- especially musicians -- are fans of the ideals @entity3 stands for : virtuosic musicianship , fearless exploration as artists and certainly stamina and longevity			1
. most easily recognized is their level of musical ability			0
@entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 appreciate the complexity of the music and the skill it takes to execute something like the guitar solo from " @entity221			0
" " they 're like musical superheroes , " @entity31 said			0
" they do things on their instruments that mere mortals ca n't do			0
" ask any drummer , @entity166 said , and they 'll tell you @entity54 is one of the best in the world			0
his drum kit is a virtual fortress of percussion , dwarfing any other professional drummer 's setup , @entity125 said			0
@entity54 's drum solos , which can last upwards of 10 minutes , are far from a good excuse to use the restroom during a concert			0
" there 's people who come specifically to see his solo , " @entity166 said			0
" he 's able to make sounds and you ca n't even see him make them , " said @entity32 of @entity54 's legendary drumming			0
fans also appreciate the artistic integrity of the band , who has historically ignored concerns and direction from their record company -- and won autonomy			1
suburban youth especially appreciate the appeal of @entity3			1
@entity125 discovered that the experience of the band spoke deeply to many others who dreamed of escaping their bedroom communities			2
songs like " subdivisions " from the album " signals " and " @entity265 , " from the album " @entity265 " became anthems for them , he said			0
but the albums themselves can also mark divisions in the fandom			0
when @entity75 introduced dominant synthesizers into the band 's until - then heavy guitar sound , many fans stopped listening , @entity166 said			1
" there 's a cutoff at ( the album ) " @entity279 , " @entity166 said			0
@entity3 's next album , " signals " put the group solidly into synth - pop territory , " and a lot of people did not like that at all			1
" but even so , he said , the group of @entity3 fans who grew up with the band 's music from the 1970s is still the largest group in the fandom			1
" then you have the fans who grew up with their music from the 1990s			2
their favorite albums are ' @entity296 , ' ' @entity297 , ' and ' counterparts , ' " he said			0
" i tell them my favorite album is ' @entity300 ' and they say , ' what ? ' " " counterparts " is another one of those divisions , @entity125 said			0
" that was the exact moment when @entity304 and @entity305 hit and the alternative ' 90s really started to go , " he said			0
" in some ways , the world @entity3 had inhabited to great success in the ' 80s was ending			1
i think ' @entity297 ' in ' 91 was their last million - seller , " he said			0
even specific songs in the @entity3 repertoire divide the fandom			1
the aforementioned rap on the song " @entity297 " makes fans either roll their eyes or chuckle at the band 's sense of humor			1
the song " @entity323 " off the album " hemispheres " either induces an " icky feeling , " as @entity32 puts it , or evokes a passionate speech about the epic qualities of the guitar - driven composition and political analysis of @entity54 's fable - like lyrics			0
@entity3 probably wo n't play " @entity297 " or " @entity323 " during the @entity5 induction ceremony , but it 's a safe bet there wo n't be a single unlit @entity335 in the group 's fanbase when @entity54 breaks into his solo .			1
