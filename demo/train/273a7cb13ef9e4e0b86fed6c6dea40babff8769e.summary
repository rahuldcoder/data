@entity0 , @entity1 -- as if the pictures of birds , fish and animals killed by floating oil in the @entity9 are not disturbing enough , scientists now say they have found evidence of another danger lurking underwater			1
the @entity13 recently discovered a second oil plume in the northeastern @entity9			1
the first plume was found by @entity17 universities in early may			2
@entity13 has concluded microscopic oil droplets are forming deep water oil plumes			1
after a weeklong analysis of water samples , @entity13 scientists found more oil in deeper water			2
" these hydrocarbons are from depth and not associated with sinking degraded oil but associated with the source of the @entity32 well head , " said @entity26 @entity25			2
through isotopic or microscopic fingerprinting , @entity25 and his @entity13 crew were able to show the oil in the plume came from @entity38 's blown - out oil well			1
the surface oil 's so - called fingerprint matched the tiny underwater droplet 's fingerprint			1
" we 've taken molecular isotopic approaches which is like a fingerprint on a smoking gun , " @entity25 said			0
full coverage of oil spill @entity38 has not commented on the latest development but in the past denied underwater oil plumes exist			1
" the oil is on the surface , " said @entity38 's chief executive officer @entity52			1
" there are n't any plumes			2
" yet @entity38 's managing director @entity57 said recently , " we 're all absolutely taking these ideas seriously and looking at them			1
" scientists on board the university 's research vessel @entity62 were not able to find the dissolved hydrocarbon or oil by sight			1
instead the crew received sensor signatures from the equipment deployed into the water since the plumes appear to be clear			2
are you there ? send us your photos @entity13 is unsure on the exact size of the plumes			0
" there are indications this is fairly wide spread , " said the @entity13 oceanographer			0
" there is probably more than one leg of this plume			0
" scientist are concerned what effect the oil , not to mention the dissolvents used to break up the oil , will have on marine life			1
laboratory tests show bacteria have begun eating some elements of the dissolved hydrocarbons			0
but the effect on fish " is what needs to be understood , " said @entity25			0
" we are in uncharted territory			0
" impact your world : how to help water samples collected by @entity13 were sent to the @entity105 labs			0
@entity105 has yet to comment on their conclusions			0
@entity105 and @entity13 will hold a joint press conference tuesday morning at the university 's @entity0 campus to release their final findings .			0
