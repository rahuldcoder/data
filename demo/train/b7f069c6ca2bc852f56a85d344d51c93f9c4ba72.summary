@entity0 -- @entity3 's @entity2 has revved ahead of @entity5 - based @entity4 in 2012 to reclaim the title of world 's biggest auto manufacturer			1
this week , @entity2 announced global sales of 9.75 million vehicles , even beating its own forecast of 9.7 million			2
@entity4 earlier this month had announced global sales of 9.29 million vehicles for 2012 -- about 460,000 fewer vehicles			2
the gap is " fairly sizeable ... about 5 % or so , " says @entity15 , @entity16 senior analyst , @entity3 autos in @entity18			1
however he sees @entity3 's return to the top in 2012 as simply " going back to the natural order of things " after @entity23 's second largest economy was devastated by the 2011 quake and tsunami			1
" it 's not that @entity4 did anything right			2
they got a free pass in 2011 because the other team ( @entity2 ) was n't on the field			1
what we saw in 2012 was a more normal situation in terms of pecking order of global sales			0
" " in 2011 , @entity3 had too many negative events which led to a shortage of ( vehicle ) supply , " agrees @entity39 's @entity38 , a @entity18 - based auto analyst			1
" if there were no such kind of events , @entity2 should ( have been ) number one ( that year )			2
" with @entity2 's return to the top , the question remains " how does it manage to succeed " just as its tech cousins in @entity3 have become infamous for hemorrhaging billions of dollars in losses			1
@entity54 in 2012 reported a record loss of $ 9.68 billion , while @entity56 reported a record $ 5.7 billion loss in last year 's fiscal year through march			2
meanwhile , @entity59 owes $ 31 billion to the banks			0
while a perceived lack of creativity and innovation plagues @entity3 's tech industry -- as well as a yen hitting post-wwii highs last year -- " it has a lot to do with a difference in the nature of the auto and tech industries " and a traditionally stronger emphasis on reliability and quality in the former , says @entity16 's @entity61			1
with tech products " consumers are very price motivated			0
they expect a television to work for several years but when they want to change it they 'll chuck it in the bin			0
but if you buy a new car , you expect it 'll work every day you own it and when you resell it you want it to hold its value , " he adds			0
for @entity3 automakers , " perfection and quality of the product matter a lot			0
" @entity2 and @entity4 in the @entity5 , the world 's second largest auto market after @entity96 , @entity4 is the country 's top - selling brand , while @entity2 is number three , after @entity100			1
but domestically in @entity3 , @entity2 is number one as @entity5 automakers have little penetration in the country			1
that likely will not change , says @entity16 's @entity61			1
" @entity5 automakers would n't invest in @entity3 because it 's already very crowded and very competitive			1
" with profit margins in the " low single digits , " @entity61 adds that @entity3 automakers do n't make much money in @entity3 as it is			1
" @entity100 would n't go in " and any idea that @entity3 makes it difficult for @entity5 automakers to enter the @entity3 market is just a " political smokescreen to attract government help from @entity115			2
" @entity61 says the @entity5 auto market provides for profit margins in the " high - single " or " low - double digit " range			0
@entity2 and @entity120 while @entity2 and @entity4 claimed the top two spots in 2012 global market sales , @entity121 sold 9.09 million vehicles to pull in at number three			1
last year was the first time @entity128 's most dominant automaker broke the nine - million vehicle barrier			0
@entity120 passed that milestone not because of stellar sales in @entity128 but because of @entity133 countries , including @entity134 and @entity96 , where it enjoys growing market share , says @entity61			0
@entity128 is a place where " global automakers go to lose money " because " current economic conditions are bad , " he says			0
just earlier this month , the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) cut its forecast for the eurozone , predicting the region 's economic activity would contract for a second consecutive year			0
" to the advantage of @entity3 's automakers , they do n't have a large presence in @entity128			1
for @entity155 automakers , it ( the economy ) is a big millstone around their neck in deep water , " he adds			0
@entity2 only has a 5 % market share in @entity128 , says @entity38 of @entity39			1
@entity2 and @entity160 while the shadow of successful @entity163 tech firms -- like @entity164 which posted a record $ 6.6 billion profit last week -- continue to loom large over their loss - making competitors in @entity3 " over the next two to three years , @entity3 will outperform @entity163 automakers in terms of sales volumes , " predicts @entity38			1
@entity163 's @entity160 , the country 's largest automaker , has recently seen strong demand with supply barely keeping up			1
and between 2007 and 2012 , auto website @entity174 revealed the average price for a @entity160 vehicle rose more than 10 % , beating the 7.5 % industry average rise			0
" a couple of years ago , @entity160 went through a very powerful product cycle , " says @entity61			2
the sonata became @entity160 's answer to the @entity183 ; @entity160 's @entity184 to @entity2 's @entity185			2
but that has now changed			0
" @entity3 is at the peak of their product cycle ( and ) is recovering from the 2011 disaster			2
we had a new camry about this time last year			0
we had a less expensive version of the @entity195 -- the @entity196 as it 's marketed in the @entity5 we 've had new @entity198 launches , relaunches of the @entity200 and @entity201			0
" " in terms of durability , @entity3 is still better than @entity163 , " adds @entity38			1
they ( @entity3 ) spend lots of money on r&d			0
in some design and marketing , @entity163 is better than @entity3 -- @entity210 has even started to benchmark @entity163 as an index of design			0
( but ) @entity163 's improvements are not a sustainable trend			0
" @entity2 's sales volumes will be the highest in @entity23 over the next few years , concluded @entity38			1
and depending on growth in @entity96 , it may continue to be tops in the world .			0

@entity2 reclaims title of world 's biggest automaker from @entity4 in 2012
' @entity4 did n't do anything right in 2011 ; @entity2 just was n't on field , ' says @entity16 's @entity61
@entity3 quake , tsunami in 2011 devastated country 's economy , supply chains
' @entity3 to continue to outperform ' over next few years , says @entity39 's @entity38
