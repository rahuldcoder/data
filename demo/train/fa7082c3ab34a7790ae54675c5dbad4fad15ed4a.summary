@entity0 -- longtime observers of the @entity3 are baffled by allegations that high - ranking officials in the @entity7 government approved a plan to assassinate @entity10 ambassador , @entity9 , and blow up the @entity10 and @entity12 embassies in @entity0			1
commentators have described the plan as " brazen , " but " bizarre " and ' bone - headed " might be more appropriate adjectives			0
it 's difficult to comprehend either the motives or the means selected to carry out the plan outlined by the @entity19 in its criminal indictment of @entity21 and @entity21			0
tensions between @entity7 and @entity10 are not new , but @entity7 has been both cautious and clever enough to restrain its ambitions for regional dominance			1
if the allegations of the assassination and bombing plot are true , and the covert operation had proved successful , @entity7 's leaders would have invited retaliation on a scale far more vigorous than any they might have contemplated			1
indeed , i think it 's fair to say that the @entity7 landscape would likely have been substantially altered			1
assuming , however , that ayatollah @entity36 , the @entity37 , and president @entity38 never authorized the action or were ever aware of it , both have great cause for concern			0
elements in their covert , black bag , assassination / terrorist unit were planning an attack that could have brought about the decapitation of their leadership , the obliteration of their ambitions to enter the nuclear weapons club and quite possibly have precipitated a global depression by engulfing the region in war			0
rather than dismissing the plot as a @entity59 fabrication , these leaders should be looking inward and holding accountable those who were responsible for undertaking such a dangerous and destructive mission			1
while awaiting greater clarification from those responsible for moving forward with the prosecution against @entity21 and @entity21 , the @entity61 should explore several options : 1			2
bring the assassination and bombing plan to the @entity69 @entity68 and seek much tougher sanctions against @entity7 ; 2			2
encourage @entity10 to review and revise its contractual arrangements with any country that refuses to support the imposition of tougher sanctions against @entity7 ; 3			1
intensify the effort to expose the activities of those nations who are circumventing the existing sanctions against @entity7 ; 4			2
make it clear to all members of the @entity69 that @entity7 's nuclear weapons program poses a serious threat to global stability			1
if a non-nuclear @entity7 initiated an assassination plan through a @entity88 drug cartel , what would it be tempted to do once it possesses a nuclear weapon ? 5			2
strengthen our ability to keep the @entity92 open should hostilities ever break out ; 6			0
force the administration and @entity95 to move forward on improving the defense posture of our friends and allies who are threatened by @entity7 ; 7			0
urge @entity10 and the @entity100 to move more aggressively in constructing coordinated , regional defense and security policies ; and 8			0
release intelligence information , to the maximum extent possible , which exposes those in the @entity7 regime responsible for this act -- as a means of galvanizing support for the actions , such as additional sanctions , mentioned above			1
the above options are illustrative only			0
others may have more punitive measures in mind			0
but right now , the @entity61 and @entity10 should proceed with vigor and not permit @entity7 to hide its dagger behind its back in its left hand , while professing its innocence with the right			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124 .			0

@entity124 : longtime @entity3 observers baffled by reports of the plot
he says if @entity7 's leaders were *n't* aware , then they have a serious *problem*
@entity7 officials must hold those *involved* accountable for their actions , he says
@entity124 : @entity61 , @entity10 can take variety of steps to increase pressure on @entity7
