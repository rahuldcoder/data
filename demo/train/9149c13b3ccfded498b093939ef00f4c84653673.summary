-- if there 's one fundamental truth about video games , it 's that smash hits tend to leave a lasting impression			1
since players often share their company for weeks , months and sometimes years on end , these titles ' faces become as familiar and welcome as those of any friend			2
it 's no surprise , then , that from " @entity17 " to " @entity16 , " many series are making a comeback			1
of course , fans can always replay classics via online services such as the @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 's @entity25 and the @entity27 's @entity26			1
but a number of new retail and downloadable outings actually promise to go one step further and rewrite gaming history by year 's end			1
each of these remakes or reboots lets you not just relive your misspent youth but revisit familiar faces in entirely new contexts			1
whether you 're a former arcade rat or a slave to the @entity43 , all should prove equal parts fresh and familiar			2
below are just a few examples of retro gaming franchises making high - profile reappearances shortly , all of which should soon have thumbs happily waggling and eyes misty with déjà vu			1
" @entity53 " ( @entity54 , @entity27 ) -- the arcade basketball game that single - handedly brought our gpa to its knees , this two - on - two baller picks up where its predecessors left off , offering more gravity - defying dunks and gleeful , rule - violating blocks			1
new features include boss battles , motion control support , secrets galore and a modern - day roster of huge - headed celeb athletes to pit against one another in smack - talking multiplayer showdowns			1
do n't be surprised if your former college roommate calls , wanting a rematch			2
" @entity74 " ( @entity75 , @entity76 360 ) -- notable at the time for their level of gore and horrific imagery , the 1988 cult classic arcade game and subsequent @entity79 and @entity80 versions now seem quaint by today 's standards			1
adding more bloodshed ( including gruesome finishing moves ) , greater freedom of movement and a spine - tingling shock horror aesthetic , the modern - day version introduces more combat moves and a high - definition makeover			0
still , the plot remains a throwback , as skull mask - wearing hero @entity96 attempts to save his kidnapped girlfriend from a legion of grotesqueries			0
" @entity101 " ( @entity102 , @entity27 ) -- this update takes the 16 - bit classic , once noted for its striking graphics , and transplants its side - scrolling action to a modern context , layering @entity109 effects on top of 2 - @entity109 elements			0
jump over yawning chasms , blast out of cannons or screech along in mine carts -- solo or with simultaneous help from a friend -- while battling bosses , nabbing bananas and hunting for hidden secrets			2
a heady mix of button - mashing thrills and platform - hopping excitement , the game lets you party like it 's 1994			2
" fallout : @entity132 " ( @entity130 , @entity131 / @entity76 360 ) -- reprises the saga of post-apocalyptic role - playing in a futuristic wasteland first begun on desktop computers back in 1997			0
( or spiritual predecessor " @entity139 , " depending on how far back you scroll			0
) wandering @entity141 's withering husk , channel your inner @entity142 while doing battle with bloodthirsty bandits and mutants			2
you 'll need both wits and makeshift weapons to survive a tomorrow gone horribly wrong			0
" @entity148 : @entity149 " ( @entity150 , @entity27 ) -- no @entity109 first - person shooter proved consoles ' ability to deliver four - player split - screen mayhem quite like the 1997 @entity156 original			0
this unexpected retread presents existing levels and storylines from new angles , and also offers multiplayer standoffs featuring a random assortment of characters , weapons and play modes			0
think of head - to - head elements like an all - star bond movie cast reunion -- except that after catching up and kibitzing , @entity169 and @entity170 get to fatally wound each other			0
also see : " @entity17 : @entity172 " ( @entity173 , @entity174 ) -- whip it good in this fantasy - themed reboot of the vampire - hunting action - adventure legend			1
" @entity179 : evolution " ( @entity180 , pc / @entity174 ) -- @entity182 as you employ light cycles and glowing disks to take on cyberspace			0
" @entity187 : ex-patriot " ( @entity173 , @entity23 / @entity188 ) -- a downloadable update of the popular @entity192 original , which pits a lone commando against legions of heavily armed adversaries .			0
