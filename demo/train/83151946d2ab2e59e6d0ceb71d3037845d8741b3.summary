@entity0 i found myself talking back to the radio this morning in a way that i 've never quite done before			0
the station was @entity6 , one of the @entity9 's leading radio stations , and the topic in question was @entity9 actor @entity13 's use of the term " colored " during his appearance on the " @entity16 " on @entity17 in the @entity18			1
the uproar that has ensued has left me slightly perplexed			0
@entity13 was discussing with @entity20 the inequality of roles for black actors in the @entity9 and the frustrating lack of opportunities for them -- a subject that is close to my heart			1
in doing so , he mistakenly used an outmoded term to describe his fellow colleagues in their struggle			1
i am , and have been , offended by the term when it has been used towards me , and i do n't ever want to be described by this word -- one that is rooted in an abhorrent period of history in many countries , and has connotations that were intended to offend			1
it of course later became the politically correct term du jour , before finally being absented from common parlance , for good			2
but wait ! my yelling at the radio this morning comes from a place where i find myself wondering			0
why are we choosing to lose the nuances here ? are we more comfortable with obscuring the bigger picture behind an admittedly mistaken use of a word , than we are with receiving the actual message that the sender was trying to offer -- a very necessary message about injustice and inequality from someone who cared enough to voice it ? is n't there a space to explore intent in a person 's actions , even when it comes to use of language that can offend ? can our racial debates simply be reduced so easily to black and white , good or bad ? my slight connection with @entity13 is that we were once @entity69 friends			1
we are loosely connected through industry friends and some of them are of color			0
so for my part , i see an actor who was on @entity20 's important show who was trying to stand in unity with his fellow actors , about an issue that has mostly been highlighted by those of color within the entertainment industry			2
i am one of those industry members			0
i have never understood issues of any kind of prejudice and inequality to be anything other than a problem for all of society			2
the idea that we can relegate certain groups to the margins , stifling any potential they may bring to the mainstream , seems a foolish lack of foresight in understanding that such prejudice harms society as a whole -- not only those relegated			2
and , in my opinion , to change endemic injustices requires a holistic approach -- one that calls on all areas of society to come together to demand change			0
so when an actor like @entity13 takes on questions of inequality and is not simply pulled up and corrected , but has his whole background and character denigrated for using a word of outdated terminology , in spite of the greater message in his words , are we not responding with the very same prejudice that we have used to label him ? are we not also terrifying others who may wish to speak out on the same issues ? wo n't they keep quiet for fear they may make a mistake under the pressure of an interview and the importance of the subject and find their message lost ? i myself have struggled in interviews to ensure my message is not lost in the split - second use of an incorrect word			1
the word has too much meaning and history for me as a black woman , but it is possible for others who are nervous and under the pressure of concerns to " get it right " to become confused and use the term " colored " in place of " people of color " when wishing to embrace black and other non-white ethnic groups			1
it 's not correct , but it 's possible to make the mistake , with the best intentions of trying to encompass all persuasions who encounter racism but in the end , i feel we all lose out if we dwell on the na√Øve use of a word ( and subsequent apology ) and become deaf to a message			0
but is n't it time we started to have more nuanced discussions on race -- where heart and intent are taken into account , allowing us to concentrate on the very real battles we face to eliminate the existence of racism from all elements of our world ?			0

@entity13 apologized for calling black actors " colored " on @entity181
@entity183 : i am , and have been , offended by the term when it has been used towards me
but are we not responding with the same prejudice that we have used to label him , she asks
