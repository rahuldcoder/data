-- as the @entity3 's @entity2 made history by coming out as gay , he sought advice from someone who 'd walked this road before : @entity9			1
in case you do n't recall , the singer soared to fame in the late ' 90s as part of the popular boy band ' @entity15 , but he did n't open up about his sexuality until 2006			1
at the time , @entity9 told @entity17 that he was acknowledging it mainly because of rumors , and that coming out made him feel like " it 's on my terms			1
i 'm at peace with my family , my friends , myself and @entity24 , so there 's really nothing else that i worry about			0
" @entity9 , who now hosts @entity28 's " dirty pop with @entity9 , " revealed on his show monday that @entity2 reached out to him for guidance through a mutual friend , actress @entity32			1
" he 's been trying to plan this for a very long time , contemplating if he wanted to do this			2
in fact , he said he was going to call me months ago , but he got too scared , " @entity9 said			2
but with @entity39 's encouragement , @entity2 finally made the call monday			2
in @entity3 , @entity2 ' defense matters more than sexual orientation " i gave him some very good advice today , because everybody wants to interview him , " @entity9 said			1
when @entity9 came out , he recalled wishing he 'd had more time to think about whom he wanted to talk to and how he wanted to do it			1
" when i came out , i had 24 hours to decide what was going to happen			0
... what i wish i could have done back then was to have a couple of days to sit down with ( the @entity51 ) , sit down with @entity52 ( and ) get downloaded ( on how to handle this ) " @entity9 said			1
" so i gave him some really great connections			0
" by putting @entity2 in touch with people such as @entity52 's @entity58 , @entity9 is aiming to help the athlete " get some really good information before he does these sit - downs , just so he does n't put his foot in his mouth ... because this will live ( on ) for the rest of his life , and he wants to make sure it 's good			1
" @entity69 ' could n't be prouder ' of @entity2 the media crush that comes with such an announcement is n't the only part of @entity2 ' story to which @entity9 relates			1
just as @entity2 was so busy with basketball that he did n't ruminate on his personal life until the 2011 @entity3 lockout , @entity9 said he was too stretched performing with ' @entity15 to focus on his personal life			1
with the lockout , @entity2 " finally got to sit back and think about himself , and relationships and love and all of that type of stuff because he had the time -- and that 's when he started becoming more comfortable with it and finding out about himself			1
and that 's exactly what happened with me when we went on the hiatus after the last ' @entity15 show , " @entity9 said			2
" we were 24/7 , had the same set schedule ( and ) i did n't have time to think about my personal life			0
and i totally relate to this because it was n't until that hiatus where i had a vacation , i had a few weeks off that i became comfortable with it , and met a guy finally and had my first relationship			0
it was that downtime that really makes you see things			0
" @entity9 told his " @entity106 " listeners that he thinks " we are going to be overwhelmed with the support he gets , " which has been steady over the past 24 hours			2
many in @entity111 and beyond have joined @entity39 and @entity9 in encouraging the @entity3 veteran , including president @entity69 , who told reporters tuesday he was " very proud " of @entity2 and had spoken with him on the phone			1
@entity115 slams @entity2 hate machine these are a few celebrities who encouraged the athlete on @entity119 : @entity120 : " ( p ) roud of @entity122 ' player @entity2 ( @ @entity123 ) for coming out			1
( @entity125 ) e will stand with you as you continue on your journey			0
" @entity128 : " @ @entity3 center @ @entity123 is the 1st out player on a @entity132 major league team			1
i 'm overwhelmed by your bravery , @entity134 , & sending so much love			0
" @entity136 : " @entity137 , @ @entity123 ! thanks for stepping up			0
and at 7 feet , that 's saying a lot			0
" @entity140 : " @entity142 support to @ jasoncollins34			0
that 's not an easy thing you did			0
" @entity147 : @entity137 to # jasoncollins for his bravery and class			0
equality and changing attitudes are just inevitable			0
@entity153 : totally loving me some @ jasoncollins34 right now			0
well done ! @entity155 : " so proud of @entity2 for being an example of bravery and courage			2
i applaud you ! ! ! " on monday evening , @entity2 responded on @entity119 : " thank you to everyone who has reached out to me thru email , texts , calls , tweets , letters , and every other form of communication			2
" looks like @entity9 was right .			2
