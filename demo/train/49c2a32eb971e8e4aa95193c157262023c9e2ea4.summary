one @entity1 artist is using the street as his canvas and changing lives in the process			1
@entity6 , who goes by his artist name @entity8 , describes himself as a creative activist who hopes to bring about social change through his projects			1
his latest ambition is to transform the @entity14 suburb , @entity15 , with murals full of color and positive messages			1
he says that business owners are happy for murals to be painted on their buildings because the color is rejuvenating the area			2
" the area , the landscape and the architecture is really rundown and neglected so a mural can do a lot for an environment , " @entity6 said			0
" @entity15 is i guess the up and coming art precinct			1
it was a thriving textile and clothing industry and community			0
a lot of families would move here to get work in these factories , but these factories unfortunately are closing down , " he continued			0
@entity6 explains that the cheap rent in @entity15 is now attracting artists and galleries to re-locate to the area but it 's not the only draw			1
" artists like to be surrounded by real culture , and there 's a real culture here			2
there 's a mix of people and it makes for an interesting life on the street , " he added			1
' @entity55 ' artists paint a brighter future @entity6 is also getting the community involved			0
one of the organizations he works with is the @entity60 orphanage , a home to boys aged eight to 18 years			2
" when i found out about this home , i proposed to the sponsor to give us funding to rejuvenate the home with colors and murals , " @entity6 said			2
but what began as murals has now turned into a weekly art workshop at the home			1
@entity6 says the boys will soon be opening their own art exhibition			0
" it 's about using art for upliftment and inspiration , to really remind these boys that they are special , " he said			2
@entity6 is also hoping to attract more artists to the area			0
he runs a residency and project space called , @entity83 , where he invites creatives from around the world to come and live in @entity15 and get involved in the community			1
" it 's a very special situation that we have here for artists to live and work in @entity15 so they just feel free to explore the streets and have a discovery of @entity1 , a real personal @entity1 story , " he said			1
while it 's unclear what the future holds for @entity15 , @entity6 says he knows that gentrification is coming and he wants to be part of it			1
" i 'm not instigating it , i 'm not the reason there is gentrification , but i can influence the gentrification for the better , with art , with sensitivity , with communication between communities , " he said			0
until then @entity6 plans to continue bringing color and beauty to the run - down suburb			0
" the nice thing about public art is , it actually translates into a language and people can be affected by it and respond to it and give their opinion , and usually their opinion is very positive , " he said			0
" we make sure to make work that is sensitive and not offensive in any way , just colorful and vibrant			0
