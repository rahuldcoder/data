-- human progress requires good ideas			1
consider how just two fundamental ideas have ushered in the modern world			2
rewind a scant 600 years , and modern science does n't yet exist			1
men and women live and die in squalor and filth , largely ignorant of the germs that ravage their bodies and of the natural laws that govern the universe , instead imploring an alleged supernatural force to help them navigate this vale of tears			2
but thanks to minds such as @entity20 , sir @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , this is not how we face the world today			2
they taught us our method of knowing : careful , mathematically precise observation , step - by - step inference and generalization , and systematic , evidence - based theory building			0
they had the courage to challenge entrenched authority , toss aside superstition and defy popes			0
as others followed the trail the first scientists blazed , human knowledge advanced dramatically			1
thanks to a second idea , this explosion of knowledge broke the confines of the laboratory and ivory tower			0
another daring group of thinkers challenged political authoritarianism			0
kings and aristocrats were swept aside to make way for the rights of man			0
this idea gave birth to a new nation , our beloved @entity59 , in which the individual was free to think and pursue his own happiness			0
a new person arose : the industrialist			0
slandered as robber barons , what these individuals actually did was earn fortunes by studying the discoveries of science and commercializing them			1
a mind - boggling array of inventions and products ensued : automobiles , oil , radios , antibiotics , refrigeration , electricity , washing machines , air conditioning , indoor plumbing , airplanes and on and on , to our present world of personal computers and cell phones			2
try to imagine life without all of this			0
but as far as we 've come because of these two ideas , human progress demands implementation of a third idea to complete the scientific and political revolutions			1
we 're still beholden to the past in ethics			0
although few of us would turn to the @entity100 or the @entity101 to determine the age of the @entity103 , too many of us still turn obediently to these books ( or their secular copies ) as authorities about morality			1
we learn therein the moral superiority of faith to reason and collective sacrifice to personal profit			1
but the more seriously we take these old ethical ideas , the more suspect become the modern ideas responsible for human progress			1
the scientists in their laboratories did not demonstrate the superiority of faith			0
@entity120 in his declaration did not proclaim the superiority of collective sacrifice			0
why should we think these ideas are the path to moral enlightenment ? perhaps , of all the damage these antiquated moral ideas do to human progress , the most significant is how they distort our conception of moral ideals			1
ask someone on the street to name a moral hero ; if he is n't at a loss , he 'll likely name someone like @entity137 or @entity138			2
why ? because they 're regarded as people of faith who shunned personal profit for the collective good			1
no one would dream of naming @entity20 , @entity23 , @entity145 or @entity146			0
it is they , not the @entity150 of the world , that we should strive to be like and teach our kids the same			0
if morality is judgment to discern the truth and courage to act on it and make something of and for your own life , then these individuals , in their capacity as great creators , are moral exemplars			2
put another way , if morality is a guide in the quest to achieve your own happiness by creating the values of mind and body that make a successful life , then morality is about personal profit , not its renunciation			1
monetary profit is just one of the values you have to achieve in life			2
but it is an eloquent representative of the whole issue , because at its most demanding , as exhibited by a @entity184 or a @entity185 , making money requires a profound dedication to material production			1
the fact that earning money is ignored by most moralists , or condemned as the root of evil , is telling of the distance we must travel			0
in effect , we need to turn the @entity197 on its head			0
the world grants , at best , no moral recognition to @entity184 and @entity201 for the personal fortunes they 've created , but it awards them a standing ovation for giving their profits away			1
but the standing ovation belongs to the act of creation , the profit they brought into their own lives and anyone who traded with them			2
if morality is about the pursuit of your own success and happiness , then giving money away to strangers is , in comparison , not a morally significant act			1
( and it 's outright wrong if done on the premise that renunciation is moral			0
) science , freedom and the pursuit of personal profit -- if we can learn to embrace these three ideas as ideals , an unlimited future awaits			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity239 and @entity240 .			1

@entity239 , @entity240 : human progress has come as result of science , *democracy*
they say our view of morality has n't been *updated* since the @entity251 and @entity101
@entity103 credits @entity184 only with his *philanthropy* and not his achievements , they say
pursuit of innovation , productivity and personal profit should be valued , they say
