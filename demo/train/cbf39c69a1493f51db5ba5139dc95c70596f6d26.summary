-- @entity2 soccer officials hope to take their showpiece tournament to the @entity4 in 2016 for a centenary celebration that could have big benefits for all concerned , but this week 's announcement appears to be somewhat premature			1
@entity8 , which runs the game in @entity10 and @entity11 and the @entity12 , said talks regarding what would be a historic tournament are still ongoing , though it is open to the possibility of having the likes of superstars @entity19 and @entity21 parading their skills in front of sellout crowds			1
world governing body @entity25 has also yet to sanction the event -- which would involve 10 @entity2 nations , the @entity4 and @entity28 plus four other countries from the @entity8 region -- in the busy international calendar			1
the @entity32 , which has featured guest nations from @entity8 since 1993 , was last staged in 2011 -- when it was won by @entity34			2
the next edition is due to be held in @entity36 in 2015 , one year after it hosts the @entity37 , while the @entity39 federation hopes to stage an additional @entity32 in the @entity4 12 months later to mark the ruling body 's 100th year of existence			1
" even though playing the @entity45 in the @entity8 region with our teams and those from @entity39 would be a wonderful experience for all fans , we are still in the midst of talks and negotiations between all parties involved in this decision , " @entity8 general secretary @entity42 said in a statement			1
" this is an idea we are hoping to materialize but we are still evaluating and discussing before it becomes official but the intention is definitely there			0
" @entity59 to open @entity60 @entity8 's continental tournament is the biennial @entity62 , which @entity28 won in the @entity4 last year			1
@entity28 and @entity63 will be guest nations at the 2015 @entity32			0
while the prospect of holding the tournament in the @entity4 may have great appeal , @entity66 's senior soccer writer @entity65 expressed concerns over whether @entity25 would allow it			1
" the @entity4 television money for big soccer tournaments is now quite large -- the @entity4 rights for 2018 and @entity74 went for a combined $ 1.1 billion , which will probably be the highest rights fee for any nation in the world , " @entity65 told @entity0			1
" there are big questions in terms of will @entity25 sanction an event like this and put it on the official calendar ? will @entity25 require clubs to release their players for it ? none of that has been made public in terms of any agreements			0
" can @entity91 help @entity93 reign in @entity94 ? the opportunity to compete against teams such as @entity36 and @entity97 , boasting the likes of @entity21 and @entity19 , is one which @entity65 feels could benefit a @entity4 team currently playing minor nations such as @entity103 and @entity104 in the @entity62			2
" the @entity4 national team is still trying to improve and the best way to do that is to play meaningful games against good competition , " he said			0
" it is hard in the @entity62 because other than @entity28 , there are not many difficult opponents for the @entity4 in @entity8			2
" to be able to have an important competitive tournament between @entity74 is really big for @entity4 soccer			2
it puts @entity4 soccer in the public eye in the @entity4 more if you have something like that			2
" @entity65 is confident the tournament would be a big hit with @entity4 sports fans			1
" this would sell out @entity125 stadiums , " he said			0
" not just for the @entity4 team , but for every team involved			0
@entity28 plays more games in the @entity4 than it does in @entity28 right now because it can sell out @entity125 stadiums			0
" it is an ongoing process			0
there is n't one big bang event which will suddenly make soccer as big in the @entity4 as it is in @entity134 and @entity2			1
but this has been a pretty steady growth over the last two decades			0
" i think it will happen in the end , but you want countries to send their best teams			0
that 's not a guarantee at this point			0
