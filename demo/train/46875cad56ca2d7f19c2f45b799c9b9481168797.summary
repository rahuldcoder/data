-- @entity1 across the luxury stalls at this year 's @entity3 , and you 'd be forgiven for thinking you 'd stumbled upon @entity6 's secret gadget lab. personal submarines , jetpacks , even a fantastical " walking " boat are all on offer for a new generation of thrill - seeking millionaires			1
younger than ever before , today 's super rich are no longer content to spend their holidays lounging on sundrenched superyachts			1
instead , they 're willing to pay millions for high - tech water toys unimaginable when the prestigious boat show first launched 24 years ago			1
" fifteen years ago a person who owned a superyacht was usually 50 years old , " explained @entity3 managing director @entity19 , in her lilting @entity23 accent			1
" now we 're seeing people who are 30 years old owning one			0
" hailing from emerging economies such as @entity30 and @entity31 , this new generation of wealthy holiday - makers are looking for unique adventures at sea -- from exploring the ocean floor in a submarine , to zooming 10 meters into the air with a jetpack			1
" these toys attract them because they have a special way of enjoying yachts , compared to their parents who perhaps had to wait until they were older to buy one , " said @entity19			2
" they like sports and really enjoy being in the sea -- not just sailing and lying on the sundeck			0
" @entity48 takes a look at four of the most eye - popping toys on show : @entity53 @entity54 : $ 1.7 million is it a jet ? a sports car ? what about a submarine ? at first glance , the futuristic @entity53 is hard to pin down			1
but the unusual two - person electric submersible , which can plunge 393 feet under the sea , appears to be to the taste of millionaire owners @entity65 , and @entity67 founder @entity66			2
" just as private individuals are now able to explore space , we see our submarines as opening up the oceans for private exploration , " said @entity68 , who founded the @entity53 company with engineer husband @entity70 in 1996			2
" except unlike spacecraft , these owners get to the pilot their own vessels			2
" the @entity53 follows an earlier model , the @entity82 , valued at $ 1.5 million			0
both are positively buoyant , meaning they always float back up to the surface , rather than sinking			0
@entity85 @entity54 : $ 2.35 -- $ 4.89 million the giant squid is real			0
how do we know ? the @entity85 caught it on camera during an expedition to the bottom of the ocean last year			0
the brightly - coloured vessel is available in 11 different models , and able to plunge anywhere between 1,000 and 36,000 feet under water			1
" it gives clients the opportunity to see a part of our planet that no human has ever visited before , " said @entity97 , the company 's sales and marketing manager			0
" many of our clients are also concerned about their legacy and the condition of the oceans , and make their submarines available to marine scientists			0
" the company expects to build between four and six submarines a year			1
@entity116 @entity54 : $ 388,000 -- $ 518,000 part speed boat , part rolling tank , the @entity117 has unsurprisingly elicited some curious looks from passersby as it " walks " out of the water			1
featuring two hydraulic " legs , " the amphibious vessel can travel for around 800 meters on dry land -- though it 's not intended for public roads			2
" all of our customers bought the yacht because they have a legitimate use for it , such as entering or exiting a waterfront property , " said the company 's sales manager @entity128			0
" we have n't had people buying it simply to show off			0
" regardless of their intentions , new owners will certainly be part of an elite group -- six of the unusual yachts have so far been sold			0
@entity143 @entity54 : $ 35,600 -- $ 129,400 @entity6 fans who watched their jetpack - wearing hero blast into the sky in 1965 film " @entity148 , " can now relive the scene -- at a price			2
the @entity143 is powered by water shooting through a 10 meter hose , and can travel through the air for up to three hours			0
it is one of dozens of high - end accessories -- including inflatable slides and jet skis -- available through @entity159 , who have stall at this year 's @entity3			1
" generally people are getting more adventurous with their luxury toys , " said @entity162 , managing director of @entity159 , which first launched three years ago			0
around 200 of the water - based jetpacks have been sold			1
travel : superyacht expeditions to the ends of the earth property : inside @entity172 's $ 67m superyacht hotel tech : will @entity175 ' robo - ships ' be the end of sailors ?			1

there 's more to this year 's @entity3 than just superyachts
personal submarines , amphibious vessels , jetpacks the new must - have toys
new generation of younger millionaires looking for adventure holidays
