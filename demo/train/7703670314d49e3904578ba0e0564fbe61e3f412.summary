-- in the middle of the massive effort to protect @entity4 from the effects of @entity6 last month , a colorful moment gave people an amusing opportunity to laugh and joke			0
it was @entity4 mayor @entity12 's efforts to communicate with @entity13 - speaking @entity4 in their own language			0
" my @entity13 skills , may continue poco a poco ( little by little ) , " said the mayor in not - so - fluent @entity13 on aug. 30 when asked by reporters about his repeated attempts to communicate in @entity13			0
@entity12 never explained whether his speaking @entity13 was out of a genuine concern to effectively communicate with people or a way to score political points with @entity4 's @entity24 voters â € ” or both			1
the @entity4 mayor is not alone			0
the relatively recent trend of politicians trying to communicate in @entity13 also includes president @entity29			1
back in june , he became the first president in 50 years to make an official visit to @entity32			2
he started his speech by greeting his supporters in @entity13			0
" @entity35 ( good afternoon ) " said the president to hundreds of his supporters who seemed excited to hear @entity29 rolling the " @entity38 " @entity32 have surpassed @entity39 as the largest @entity41 group of voters in @entity43 , a swing state expected to be highly contested once again in 2012			1
some @entity38 presidential candidates also seem to be courting @entity41			1
on sept. 2 , @entity46 attended a breakfast sponsored by the @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity43			0
about 100 @entity24 leaders from across the country heard @entity46 's speech			1
the former @entity54 governor did n't try to roll any @entity55 , but paid close attention to the issue of how much the economic downturn has hit @entity59			0
" hispanics , as you know , have been hit terribly hard , disproportionately hard with an unemployment rate that is substantially higher than the national figures , " @entity46 said			0
experts say appealing to the fastest - growing ethnic group in the country is crucial the year before presidential elections			2
@entity68 , associate director at the @entity69 , says that " latinos have played a growing and important role in the nation 's presidential elections over the last few election cycles			0
there are now more than 21 million hispanics who are eligible to vote and @entity59 reside in some key states			2
" according to the @entity79 , in the 2008 presidential election , @entity59 represented 13 percent of all voters in @entity81 , 14 percent in @entity82 , 15 percent in @entity43 , and 38 percent in @entity83			1
those four states will likely be swing states again in 2012			0
" even the participation rate among hispanics in presidential elections has been growing [ in those states ] , " says @entity68			0
in 2008 , 9.5 million of the nation 's 12 million registered @entity41 voters went to the polls			1
@entity93 , president of the @entity95 @entity94 , an organization that tracks @entity41 voting trends , says he 's expecting a dramatic increase next year			1
" our estimate is that we will probably have at least 12 to 13 million registered to vote in the next presidential election			2
it could be even higher , " @entity93 says			0
in 2004 , former president @entity102 won more than 40 percent of the @entity41 vote			1
four years later , 67 percent of @entity24 voters went for @entity29			1
experts say anybody getting that kind of support from @entity59 next year , whether @entity109 or @entity38 , has a good chance of winning the presidency			0
" the @entity41 vote can prove decisive and we have demonstrated the ability to swing critical states again like we did in 2008 , " says @entity93			1
still , @entity93 cautions that it 's still too early to determine what the @entity41 voter behavior will be in 2012 , and whether the enthusiasm of 2008 is going to be there again			2
" are we going to continue to increase in voter registration and voter turnout as we have in every consecutive presidential election over the last 30 years ? it remains to be seen , " says @entity93			2
according to the most recent @entity95 @entity79 figures , there are currently 50.5 million people of @entity24 origin in the @entity95 , which represents 16.3 percent of the total population .			1
