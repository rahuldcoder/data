-- the word itself -- housewife -- still seems almost shockingly retro			1
but it 's having something of a renaissance , thanks in no small part to @entity10 's now ubiquitous " @entity11 " series			2
so the time seems right to salute the small screen 's most fashionable female homemakers -- read on to see who made @entity0 's top 10 ! @entity17 , " the @entity18 " from 1958 - 1966 , @entity19 played the kind of coolly capable stay - at - home mother who 's really only seen on television : always impeccably turned out -- the woman did housework in full - skirted shirtdresses and chic high heels -- she embodied a particular upper - middle - class ideal like no character before or since			1
see all 12 of the most stylish tv housewives of all time @entity32 , " the @entity32 " just 24 when she was cast in this 1961 - 1966 comedy , @entity33 put a youthful spin on her traditional role ... and did her part to modernize the typical tv housewife 's wardrobe , as well			1
" i had @entity32 wear pants , " she has explained of her famous cigarette - style slacks , " because i said , ' women do n't wear full - skirted dressed to vacuum in			2
' " @entity43 , " @entity44 " gorgeous , glamorous @entity45 played to type in this goofy 1965 - 1971 series , starring as a @entity47 ( by way of @entity49 ) socialite forced to swap her palatial @entity52 pad for a run - down old farmhouse			1
even after relocating to rural @entity54 , though , she dressed the part of an uptown girl , donning pretty peignoirs and chic dresses to collect fresh - laid eggs and coax milk from cows			2
@entity62 : the top 10 blondes in @entity64 @entity65 , " @entity66 " certainly she 's got style			2
since 1989 , @entity65 ( voiced by actress @entity68 ) has consistently rocked a signature look : her strapless green dress , paired with low - cut red kitten heels and a red beaded necklace , is timeless , and her bright blue beehive is almost literally inimitable , making mrs. homer one - of - a - kind			2
@entity75 , " @entity76 " two different actresses played " @entity82 " during this show 's 1990 - 1996 run , and both had their supporters			1
but @entity83 ( 1990 - 1993 ) and @entity84 ( pictured above , 1993 - 1996 ) shared a wardrobe as restrainedly chic as you 'd expect from a hip professor turned @entity89 mom			1
@entity91 : 100 @entity90 @entity92 , " @entity93 " as the always - impeccable @entity94 -- who retired early from her gallery job after marrying @entity97 ( @entity98 ) and then found lasting love and domesticity with @entity101 ( @entity102 ) -- @entity103 wore classic @entity105 favorites like @entity106			1
her look was slightly more adventurous in the 2008 and 2010 films than it was in the series ' initial 1998 - 2004 run ( she donned vintage @entity112 and @entity113 during the girls ' trip to @entity116 ) but she 'll always be remembered for her mastery of the three ps : @entity119 , @entity120 , and @entity121			2
@entity122 , " @entity123 " in this show 's seven seasons , @entity122 ( @entity124 ) has been through a lot -- three marriages to two different men , several affairs , and two babies ( one of which she later learned was switched at birth )			0
despite the drama -- and having rebounded from a period during which she was forced to sell her designer clothes to keep the family afloat -- she 's still perfectly capable of looking ( and dressing ) like the fashion model she used to be			1
@entity62 : @entity124 's transformation @entity143 , " @entity144 " @entity145 , the actress who has played @entity143 ( now @entity146 ) since 2007 , has said that putting on her character 's early 1960 's garments is a key part of her process			1
" i get into the girdle , the bra with the pointy cups , the stockings , the heels , the big dress ... and i 'm halfway there			0
" ironically , the show 's retro full - skirted ensembles have had a profound effect on current fashion , which is perhaps part of the reason january has said she hopes the action does n't continue into the 1980 's			1
" i do n't want to see @entity143 in @entity165			0
" @entity166 , " @entity167 " " latin women are very comfortable with their bodies and their sexuality			0
we are n't afraid to show that off a little bit more , " actress @entity174 has said			0
if so , her character on this current series seems to share that outlook			0
@entity166 , a stay - at - home mom , would n't be caught dead in frumpy sweats or mom jeans ; instead , she chooses slim pencil skirts and a series of colorful , cleavage - baring tops			1
@entity62 : the top 10 brunets in @entity64 @entity184 , " @entity11 of @entity185 " she 's a little less flashy than her castmates ( several of whom seem to have been lifted from the pages of a @entity191 novel )			0
instead , former actress @entity98 prefers to keep it semi-real , although she still likes a little glitter			0
" i love the sparkles that are very much in style right now , " she has said			0
" i tone it down with black pants and boots			0
i like to wear things that are feminine and sexy , but not too trendy			0
