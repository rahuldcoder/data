@entity0 -- some family members of people killed in the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks announced thursday that they have requested the names and addresses of other survivors as part of an effort to stop the city from placing unidentified remains in a repository in a museum under construction at ground zero			1
a spokesman for @entity0 mayor @entity17 said flatly that providing the names " is not something we will do			1
" the 17 family members filed a @entity23 request so they can notify other families and seek their input			1
they say they and other families were never notified or consulted about the plan , which they consider part of a commercial operation to lure tourists			0
" these are our beloved remains , our sons , our daughters , our siblings and spouses , " @entity32 said			0
her son , @entity39 , was a @entity0 firefighter killed on 9/11			1
" we have the right to decide where they will spend eternity			0
" more than half of the families of the 2,749 victims of the @entity48 attacks never received any remains of their loved ones			2
many others were able to bury only partial remains			0
more than 9,000 body parts are still unidentified and have been stored in temporary structures maintained by the @entity0 @entity55			2
the current plan calls for the remains to be housed in an underground repository , behind a wall in the museum , and adjacent to a memorial gallery filled with pictures and artifacts of the victims			2
the museum , which is under construction , is located beneath the footprints of the two @entity48 towers			0
the repository will be controlled by the medical examiner 's office , which will continue to have access to the remains in the hope that , as dna technology progresses , more positive identifications can be made			1
the @entity76 and @entity77 disputes the claims that families were never notified about the plans , and says it was the express wish of many families that their loved ones ' remains return to the bedrock at ground zero			1
" families have been part of a robust process through which they were consulted during public and private meetings with officials , as well as offered opportunities for public comment , " according to a statement from the organization			0
" and they have repeatedly stated it is essential the remains return to the sacred bedrock of the site			0
" feedback from those meetings also led to the creation of a private space , open only to families , near the repository			2
and families will also be able to make individual appointments to visit the repository after hours , according to the @entity76 organization			2
in response to the @entity113 request , a spokesman for @entity110 said , " many family members would rightly be outraged if the city made their personal information , including home addresses , public , and of course that is not something we will do			1
" additional @entity113 requests were also sent to the mayor 's community affairs unit , the medical examiner and the @entity126			0
retired deputy chief @entity127 , who lost his firefighter son @entity128 on 9/11 and is part of the group that filed the @entity113 request , said he always knew the remains would come back to ground zero			1
" but we were told it was going to be separate and distinct from the museum and visitor 's center , " he said , adding that what he envisioned was more akin to the @entity134 at @entity135 , that would be above ground and distinct from the museum			0
like the other family members he joined at the thursday press conference near ground zero , @entity128 said he never received any notification about the decision with regard to the remains			1
in a recent opinion piece published in the @entity154 , family members who are also board members of the museum foundation said it was decided that an underground repository was better than an above - ground tomb			1
" the latter structure would be a constant magnet for disrespectful public displays and demonstrations ... and would be impossible to secure around the clock , " they wrote			0
@entity128 dismissed the notion that an above - ground tomb could not be protected			0
attorney @entity165 , who filed the @entity113 request on behalf of the families , said he has seen " not a single letter ... that was addressed to the families notifying them of the plan and asking them for their input regarding the plan			1
" in contrast , @entity175 , who lost her firefighter brother @entity176 on 9/11 , said she had received letters from the @entity76 regarding other matters , such as confirming the correct spelling of her brother 's name and informing her of location of the name on the above - ground memorial			0
" surely a letter should have been sent out on letterhead from the @entity76 and @entity77 and the @entity0 telling us , at the very least , what they were doing with our loved ones ' remains , " she said .			2

@entity23 request filed seeking names , addresses of 9/11 families
17 family members say they are *displeased* with plans for repository for remains
