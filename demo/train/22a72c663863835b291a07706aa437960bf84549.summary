when the tearful broadcaster broke the news to @entity4 that their leader , @entity5 , had died , the audience in the hall gasped			1
then the hysterics began , along with the bawling and sobbing			0
" @entity11 ! " mourners cried			0
a wailing woman pounded her fist against her chest to signify heartache			0
some appeared to go into physical convulsions			0
other @entity4 sobbed so hard , they barely maintained their balance			1
" our leader endured all the hardships , " one mourner told state - run @entity20 in a televised interview			2
" i ca n't believe it			0
our leader , he 's still with us			2
" even the reporter holding @entity20 's microphone bowed his head and trembled			2
in @entity4 media videos viewed by @entity32 , people wept in fitful , theatrical proportions			1
whether the mass grieving was genuine is up to debate			1
for instance , in @entity38 , it 's acceptable to express sorrow vocally , said @entity41 , a research fellow at the @entity42			2
but @entity4 presents a unique case			1
" it 's such a regimented , uniform society , people are conditioned from their early years to praise and adore their leader , " he said			1
" the passing of their leader would be an indication to grieve properly so they are not to be stigmatized by failing to grieve properly			0
there are always people watching you -- if you are not devastated by the news , you may get in trouble			1
" while some may exaggerate , for others the grief is authentic , @entity41 said			0
" i think there would be great deal of sincerity , because they 're so programmed and conditioned and have an incentive to outperform their families , neighbors in grieving properly , " he said			2
" @entity4 are raised to praise their leader , as are @entity68 for @entity69			1
for @entity4 , it 's part of the rhetoric to thank the fatherly leader			1
for them to learn the death of a near @entity69 - like leader , it certainly has an emotional reaction			1
" when tv cameras approached the @entity4 grievers , some of them were so overwhelmed they could barely utter coherent sentences			1
" if it 's a public figure that has died , everybody has the illusion that they know that person or were at some point connected to them , " said @entity83 , a grief management specialist and director of the @entity86 in @entity87			2
" mass hysteria soon occurs and is very contagious			0
when we see people do things in large groups , it spreads like wildfire			2
it only takes a few people , and the reactions spread amongst the population			2
" @entity4 interviewed on state television thanked @entity5 for everything , including trains , theaters and even their warm homes			1
many seemed to refuse to believe he was dead			0
the public mourning illustrates the grip of @entity5 's power , said @entity115 , director of research and anthropology at the @entity118 and psychology professor at the @entity120			1
to stay in power , many dictators identify and play upon their people 's fears			1
after a history of occupation by other @entity128 powers , @entity5 and his father relied on their motto of self - sufficiency , called " juche , " to justify the country 's reclusive nature			1
because of this philosophy , which barred outside perspectives , @entity115 said people in @entity4 " had no alternative view of reality			1
" it also helped that the @entity141 controlled the police and military			0
@entity115 said he believes @entity4 ' weeping is " absolutely sincere			2
they 're clearly emotionally tied up with the dictator			0
" " we 're used to some extent of institutionalized criticism , an opposition , and in these countries , there is n't anything			0
there is uniform control of information			0
the only information comes from the political leadership in ways it desires			0
that 's your world -- you see the world of threat and fear , and the dictator poses as the way out of it			0
" @entity115 compared the reaction to @entity5 's death to @entity173 dictator @entity172 's passing in 1975			1
" the place where his support was , there was mass mourning and hysteria at his death , " he said			0
drawing another historical comparison , @entity41 said he recalled when @entity5 's father , @entity182 , died in 1994			1
" the level of grief , we hear from @entity4 defectors , was that the @entity4 people had general admiration for the father because he had revolutionary credentials , " @entity41 said			1
" @entity191 did not go through a famine under the elder @entity5			2
" nevertheless , mourners were effusive in their praise for @entity5 on the state - run television station			1
" he has loved us so much			0
we were n't able to repay him , " one mourner said			0
another said , " it 's too much ! it 's too much ! leader , please come back			0
... you can not leave us			0
we will always wait for you , leader			0

@entity207 shows hysterical reaction to @entity5 's death
but the genuineness of people 's grieving is up to debate
