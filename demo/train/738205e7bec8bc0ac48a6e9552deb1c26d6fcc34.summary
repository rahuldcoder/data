to veto or not to veto : it 's up to @entity2 gov. @entity1			1
she must decide if she is going to sign into law legislation that would allow business owners , as long as they assert their religious beliefs , to deny service to gay and lesbian customers			2
if she approves it , the state could face litigation and a boycott , potentially harming @entity2 's economy and tourism industry as well as next year 's @entity16			1
@entity2 lawmakers pass controversial anti-gay bill in an exclusive interview with @entity21 's @entity20 on monday , @entity1 addressed the aspects she must consider			1
" i have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial , to listen to both sides of those issues , and i welcome the input and information that they can provide to me			1
and certainly i am pro-business , and that is what 's turning our economy around , so i appreciate their input , as i appreciate the other side , " she said			0
earlier , @entity1 told @entity21 that her decision will come after she returns this week to @entity2 from @entity41 , where she has been attending @entity43 meetings			1
" i have to look at what it says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing , " she said			2
the bill was sent to @entity1 on monday and she has five days to sign it , veto it , or do nothing and it would become law			1
she has been a conservative champion for much of her five years in office			2
and if that 's any indication , the measure could very well become law			0
but it 's not that straightforward			0
her conservative creds as secretary of state , @entity1 landed the gubernatorial gig in 2009 after previous gov. @entity65 left her job to head the @entity67			1
just over a year into her tenure , @entity1 rose to national prominence after signing @entity71 into law , a strict immigration measure also known as the " show me your papers " law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents , which critics say leads to racial profiling of @entity82			1
she made national headlines again for wagging her finger at president @entity88 on a @entity90 tarmac after he stepped off of @entity91 over immigration			0
in her bid for re-election in 2012 , she won the endorsement of the @entity96 , even though her primary opponent sat on the organization 's board of directors			0
the endorsement was well - earned , as was her a + rating			0
under her , @entity2 became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit			1
and people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed			0
but her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said @entity2 would participate in the controversial expansion of @entity116 under the @entity117			1
many conservative governors chose to opt out , but @entity1 called it a " moral " obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured			1
@entity124 record while social and religious conservatives hope her conservative principles continue to guide her action regarding the @entity124 measure , her record on lesbian and gay issues is thin			1
@entity132 , vice president of @entity133 , said that @entity1 's record on related issues is " largely unproven			1
" while she vetoed a similar measure last year , it had nothing to do with the content of the bill , but political power plays inside the @entity143			2
the one substantive time she acted was not on the side of gay rights			0
she ended domestic partner benefits for state employees , which was a measure her predecessor implemented			0
@entity1 said the state could n't afford it , and she defended her decision in court			2
" she 's been mostly silent on the issue of marriage equality and those types of things , " @entity132 said			0
lgbt rights : the patchwork states of @entity163 some insight where @entity1 has a proven record is in the area of @entity2 businesses , cutting regulations and taxes			1
and that could provide the clearest signal on what @entity1 might do this week			2
some influential business groups in @entity2 oppose @entity175 , the " religious freedom bill			1
" a letter that numerous business leaders sent @entity1 on monday encouraged her to oppose it			1
" after analyzing the bill , we are very concerned about the effect it could have on @entity2 's economy , " said the letter , signed by the @entity182 , among others			2
" we can not support measures that could expose our businesses to litigation , nor do we want to send a message that our state is anything but an open and attractive place for visitors and the top talent that will be the cornerstone of our continued economic growth			0
" and @entity1 is well liked in the business community			1
" we believe she 's done more than any governor nationwide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state , " said @entity200 , a spokesman for the @entity182			0
" we know this governor always does what she believes is in the best interest of the state			0
" and lgbt rights groups hope that her close ties with the business community is enough to persuade her to oppose it			2
" this is where we hope her pro-business stance will prevail , " @entity132 said			0
growing support @entity1 is also facing growing support for a veto			2
is same - sex marriage no longer a political issue ? public pressure is mounting			0
another major protest took place monday evening outside the state @entity143			0
businesses are hanging signs in their windows that read " open for business to everyone ! " both @entity2 senators , republicans @entity231 and @entity233 , have publicly urged @entity1 to veto			1
and according to the local newspaper in @entity237 , state sen. @entity234 , who voted for the measure , is now urging @entity1 to pick up her veto pen			2
while the measure is not about same - sex marriage , a likely indicator of where @entity241 stand on the @entity242 is a @entity246 's @entity245 from last year			0
it found that a majority of @entity241 support same - sex marriage			0
@entity250 , an @entity251 professor of political science , noted that " it 's an extreme measure even for ( conservative ) @entity2			1
" " she 'll be viewed more reasonable than liberal " if she vetoes it , @entity250 said			0
a spokesman for the @entity258 , which will host @entity259 , in @entity260 next february , said the league is watching developments in @entity2			1
" our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness , and prohibit discrimination based on age , gender , race , religion , sexual orientation , or any other improper standard , " @entity263 said .			0

the fate of @entity175 rests with @entity1 , who says she will " do the right thing " for @entity2
she cites her " open dialogue on bills that are controversial "
conservative record might show what she 'll do ; @entity124 advocates *pin* hopes on business ties
@entity258 , which will host @entity16 in @entity2 next year , says it is *monitoring* situation but
