-- before i explain why i believe the time has come to start a stop - the - war movement , i should say that i am not one of those intellectuals who has never worried about the fate of their loved ones or gotten his own boots dirty			0
my son completed a five - year stint in the @entity14 @entity13			1
as an @entity16 commando , i saw a lot of fighting during @entity16 's war for independence			1
my unit started fighting with 1,100 members ; when the fighting stopped , 700 were dead and buried or wounded			0
and we killed all too many on the other side			0
i abhor war and believe we should fight only when there is a clear and present danger , when all other means for resolving a conflict have been truly exhausted and to protect the innocent			0
those are the three criteria of a just war			0
the war in @entity34 used to meet these criteria			1
we invaded @entity34 to stop it from serving as a base for terrorists of the kind who attacked us on 9/11			1
this goal has been accomplished			2
fewer than 100 members of @entity45 are in @entity34			1
there are many more in @entity47 and @entity48 , which we are not planning to invade			0
the @entity50 has no designs on us , beyond making us leave			1
after that , the people of @entity34 can duke it out over which kind of regime they want			1
if the majority of the @entity34 people do n't want the @entity50 to rule , they should fight for their rights , as they have shown they can when they defeated the @entity50 in 2002 with limited help from us			1
some claim that we must keep fighting to secure human rights , especially women 's rights , and a democratic regime in @entity34			1
however , nothing indicates that we can accomplish in this godforsaken 12th - century country what we did in @entity71 and @entity72 after @entity73 see more opinion articles at @entity0 the metrics that the @entity76 keeps inventing to show progress are pitiful			0
having committed 100,000 troops and a similar number of " private " contractors against rag - tag , poorly equipped , illiterate locals , we captured a few scores of square miles , opened a few markets and a local government or two			0
but large and growing areas of @entity34 are under @entity50 control			1
we should neither die nor kill for an illusion			2
sometimes , a minor news item highlights a much greater issue			2
a recent report from an embedded reporter for @entity94 shows a 19 - year - old @entity14 soldier getting shot in the head -- his helmet saved him from death -- as his unit traveled through @entity100 in late august			1
they were surveying polling sites for the upcoming elections			2
also , a homemade bomb , called an ied , damaged and set afire the lead vehicle of this small convoy and severely wounded its driver			0
it seemed absurd to risk lives of @entity14 , our allies or @entity34 to support faux elections			1
in many parts of the country , ballot stations could not be opened			0
in others , massive fraud took place			0
adding insult to injury , we congratulated the @entity34 government on holding " successful " elections			1
that way , we did not have to admit to the world and each other that whatever the @entity128 government is -- one of the most corrupt governments in the world , a foundation of a new narcostate -- democracy it ai n't , by a long shot			2
how much our entanglement in @entity34 is turning into a sad farce became all too clear when president @entity139 flew to @entity140 to tell @entity128 that he ought to stop corruption			2
when , in response , @entity128 started negotiating a peace deal with the @entity50 , the @entity142 rolled out the red carpet for @entity128 and announced that from now on , the @entity14 will focus on low - level corruption			1
moreover , it turns out that major sources of corruption are our corporations and the @entity151			0
it 's time to bring our troops home			0
to encourage our president and @entity155 to withdraw the troops , let 's fasten to our lapels white ribbons ( for peace ) with black letters ( mourning those who died ) that read " bring them home			0
" the time has come to organize teach - ins and antiwar groups			0
instead of another march on @entity169 , let there be rallies across @entity14			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

@entity175 was @entity16 commando , son served in @entity14 @entity13
@entity175 says @entity14 goal , to *rid* @entity34 of @entity45 , has been met ; only 100 *remain*
@entity175 says people should not die for fraudulent elections , corrupt regime
@entity34 must resolve @entity50 issue itself , he writes , and @entity14 should pull out
