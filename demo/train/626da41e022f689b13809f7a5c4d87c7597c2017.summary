the recession has been rough on everyone -- except maybe @entity2 , who 's emerged with some good material for his new album			1
he says " @entity11 " was inspired by @entity5 , and even though some of these songs were written before anyone pointed a bullhorn at the banks , he 's smart to make that declaration			1
whenever @entity15 's falling on hard times , his music simply sounds better , his lyrics taking on near - biblical significance			1
take 2000 's '' @entity18 , '' which was originally written to help promote the revitalization of @entity20 , @entity21 , but took on an entirely new meaning after september 11 , when he began introducing it as '' a prayer for our fallen brothers and sisters			0
'' or there 's 2005 's '' @entity30 , '' penned before the 2003 invasion of @entity32 , which became a de facto anti-iraq - war song after he added a coda for the troops : '' bring ' em home ! '' whenever there 's a movement in need of an anthem , it turns out @entity2 has already written one			1
there 's no doubt that die - hard fans will hear a fierce rallying cry on behalf of the 99 percent on " @entity11			1
" with an awesomely rootsy production style that recalls 2006 's " the @entity50 , " the album even sounds like a cross section of @entity15 , drawing from folk , gospel , and hip - hop			1
and on " @entity56 's " best moments , @entity2 is fired up enough to borrow a socket wrench and knock out @entity59 ' teeth			2
the working - man paean '' @entity61 '' recalls '' born in the @entity15 '' both in its upbeat @entity63 boogie and in its ironic message , which practically dares some @entity65 to misinterpret it as a campaign song			1
elsewhere , the moving title track ( one of the last to feature the late , great @entity69 ) stands among his best blue - collar anthems , with a chorus that 's the perfect prayer for anyone who 's been laid off : '' hold tight to your anger / and do n't fall to your fears			2
'' of course , that message could just as easily apply to football fans			2
( he actually wrote '' @entity11 '' about the demolition of @entity80			2
) that 's the problem here : the images are so broad -- every song 's got a rising flood or a train of sinners or a dead man 's moon -- you 'll be dying for a detail that 's anchored in the real world , circa 2012			0
true , @entity2 's ballads have always been made of archetypes like rivers and fast cars			0
but he 's rarely written anything as excruciatingly vague as '' you 've got it , '' which plays like @entity101 clues : '' @entity102 n't no one can break it / @entity102 n't no one can steal it ...			0
you just know it / when you feel it			0
'' though there are heartfelt tributes to the downtrodden , the only overt reference to the financial collapse comes in '' @entity112 , '' when he scoffs at '' all them fat cats			0
'' the money may be easy -- but the target is too			0
