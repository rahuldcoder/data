@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 says he and president @entity3 have a " pretty good relationship , " but he also criticized @entity3 for fomenting what @entity2 called " class warfare " in the political debate over spending , taxes and job creation			1
in an interview broadcast sunday on @entity13 's " @entity14 " program , @entity2 defended @entity16 opposition to efforts by @entity3 and @entity18 to increase taxes on wealthy @entity20 as part of deficit reduction and job creation measures			1
the top 1 % paid 38 % of income taxes in @entity20 , " @entity2 , @entity24 , said in the interview taped friday when asked about the persistent @entity16 stand against tax increases			0
" how much more do you want them to pay ? " @entity3 has crafted a campaign theme of republicans defending the wealthy against tax cuts as part of a narrative that @entity2 said was intended to pit segments of society against each other			0
" we are not going to engage in class warfare , " @entity2 said , adding : " the president 's clearly trying to do it , and it 's wrong			0
" republicans generally want to cut government spending and debt by shrinking the size of government and therefore oppose raising taxes or adding new tax revenue			1
however , @entity2 and some other @entity16 advocate the possibility of increasing government revenue through a revised tax code that lowers rates but expands the number of taxpayers			2
such a step would only be acceptable " as long as our colleagues on the other side are serious about cutting spending , " @entity2 said in the @entity13 interview			2
during negotiations with @entity3 this year on a possible comprehensive deficit reduction deal , @entity2 reportedly agreed to as much as $ 800 billion in additional revenue as part of the package			1
the talks broke down over differences on the tax issue and entitlement cuts , and @entity2 said in the interview that the specific trade - offs discussed then with @entity3 appeared out of reach now			0
" i think it 's hard to put @entity73 back together again , " he said			0
when asked how much additional revenue republicans could accept in a deal , @entity2 responded : " that 's the $ 64 million question			0
" a special joint congressional committee created to work out a deficit reduction deal faces a november 23 deadline , with no breakthrough in sight			1
@entity2 disagreed that the 12 - member panel -- evenly divided between @entity16 and @entity18 from the @entity85 and @entity86 -- was at an impasse , but he emphasized the issues being tackled were hard -- too hard for he and @entity3 to resolve			1
" nobody ( was ) more upset that we could n't come to an agreement , the president and i , than i was , " @entity2 said			0
as far as he and the president are concerned , " it 's been a little frosty here the last couple of weeks , but we 've got a pretty good relationship			2

the @entity85 speaker says his relationship with the president is " pretty good "
@entity2 is open to increasing tax revenue , as long as @entity18 will cut spending
crafting a deficit reduction deal is hard work but not yet at an impasse , @entity2 says
