-- @entity2 president @entity1 , who is on a three - country tour in @entity5 in a bid to build support for @entity9 recognition of a @entity2 state , met with the president of @entity12 on sunday			1
@entity12 president @entity13 expressed his support for a @entity2 state and said that he hopes it will soon have a place at the @entity9 , according to the president 's website			1

@entity12 recently recognized the @entity28 territories as a " free , sovereign and independent state , " the website said			2

a @entity9 committee is expected to issue a report on its analysis of the historic @entity2 bid soon			2
if a majority of the committee says the prospective @entity2 state fulfills the @entity9 charter 's requirements , it will send the application back to the full @entity47 for a vote			1
the @entity28 would then need nine of 15 votes in their favor , and no veto from any of the five countries that are permanent members of the @entity47			0
@entity55 officials have vowed to block the measure , though they most likely want to avoid an @entity55 veto out of concern over a potential backlash across the @entity60			0

" the body could change that status to permanent observer " state , " identical to the @entity72 's standing at the @entity9			2
