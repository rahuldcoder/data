-- when @entity2 of " @entity3 " lit a cigarette on her son 's school bus during a class trip , i cracked up			2
after all , the prospect of a 2014 mom smoking around her child 's classmates is about as likely as teens giving up their smartphones			2
motherhood has changed a lot since i grew up in the 1960s			1
back then , women smoke and drank during pregnancy			0
( my mom says she even smoked in the hospital after delivering my sisters and me			0
) today , expecting women add sushi and lunch meat to their alcohol and smoking bans			2
back then , dr. @entity26 was the only guide for child - rearing			0
today , there are too many manuals to count and @entity31 is just a click away from parental questions answered			2
back then , we did n't have playdates			0
" you went out in the yard or you went out in the street and played , " my mom told me with a chuckle			0
today , my kids have piano , soccer , basketball , gymnastics and hip - hop dance			1
how do you spell overscheduled ? in conversations with moms raising children today and moms who had kids in the 1960s , ' 70s and ' 80s , they all agreed that motherhood is a whole lot different nowadays			1
the question is , has it changed for the better or worse ? ' less of that judgment ' @entity56 , a mom of two in @entity58 , @entity59 , says part of her wishes she was raising children in the early ' 80s , like her mom			1
" i feel like in that pre-internet era we were n't quite as exposed to other people 's pet peeves , " said @entity56 , who writes a blog in her own name			2
" there was less of that judgment and less of other people making you insecure			0
you did n't have to hop on @entity74 and see a ton of different people telling you why giving your kid a processed cookie is child abuse			0
" what 's different today , says @entity81 , a mom of two in @entity83 , @entity84 , is the level of paranoia			1
" it seems like mothers these days are definitely more paranoid and uptight about every little detail of their children 's lives , much more than they were 30 , 40 years ago , " said @entity81 , a @entity88 contributor			1
" it just seems that parenthood altogether was much simpler without the education that we have now and the devices ... to be honest with you , i think i prefer the carefree method more than scared - of - everything - we - eat - and - even - our - shadows			0
" from @entity26 to @entity103 @entity104 , another @entity88 contributor , said the problem is that parents today suffer from " information overload			1
" dr. @entity26 was " the bible for parents , " when she was born in the 1970s , said the @entity111 mom of two and host of a bilingual blog called @entity114			2
" now you have attachment parenting , then you have ' tiger moms , ' and people tell you to co-sleep			2
others tell you that you are a terrible parent if you co-sleep ... and pediatricians will tell you one thing and then people will search online and they 'll find a blog that says completely the opposite and so it 's very confusing			2
" @entity31 can be a friend for today 's parents , but it also can be a foe , said @entity56 , the mom from @entity58 , who shared a story about how she went online late one night when she was n't able to calm her crying daughter			1
" i 'm like , ' oh no , maybe she has brain trauma or stomach problems , ' and then it 's like , ' oh			2
no. she 's just teething			2
' " ironically , @entity56 's mom , @entity135 , who raised @entity56 and her seven siblings starting in the early ' 80s , thinks the 24/7 access to information is one of the biggest and best parenting differences from when she was a mother			2
" i think it 's great being able to access the internet at 2 o'clock in the morning when you are just scared to death , " @entity135 said			0
@entity145 , a mom of four in @entity146 and host of the blog @entity149 , said technology can be very powerful for parents today -- when it 's used properly			1
" it 's almost like the @entity153 of this century in that we 're totally learning from each other 's experiences through the @entity142 , " she said			1
less freedom , more schedules another difference between parenting then and now , moms say , is a loss of freedom and independence during childhood			1
when @entity167 and her family moved to a small town in @entity170 from @entity171 , she felt comfortable letting her children roam the neighborhood without her			0
" my kids then could walk to the swimming pool by themselves , and do things that i had no idea what they were doing , " the mom of eight said			0
today , there 's none of that			1
" my grandkids are getting so scheduled and i understand why , " she said			0
" this is not a complaint on their parenting ... they ca n't have just unattended moments and it 's sad			0
" @entity191 , a mom of two in @entity146 who grew up in the ' 60s and ' 70s , remembers playing outside by herself as a kid			1
" a lot of my favorite memories were playing ' war ' ... until well after dark with no one even calling to see where i was			0
so do you think it was neglectful parenting ? " the host of the blog @entity200 as @entity201 said with a laugh			0
she concedes there is a definite tradeoff between safety and independence in today 's parenting			1
in her opinion , the tighter control is better , ultimately			0
" i just think there 's a pendulum swing or backlash from those of us raised in the late ' 60s , early ' 70s , which was that we were really left to our own devices , and what was great about that , was there was a feeling of autonomy and self - direction , " she said			1
" but there was a much greater risk			0
" ' you 're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy ' during my first - ever interview of my mom , @entity231 of @entity232 , @entity233 , i asked her to compare parenting back in the ' 60s and ' 70s , when she raised my sisters and me , with parenting today			1
" the biggest difference is that i feel like you 're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy , taking them everyplace and having to take up all their time with activities , where in the ' 60s , that was n't the case , " she said			1
" when you were little , you would go out and play with your friends , you kind of entertained yourself more than the parents nowadays , who are constantly trying to entertain the kids			1
" but why did we move from the carefree , laissez - faire parenting of the ' 60s and ' 70s to the more frenetic helicopter approach of today ? " the reality is now we know more about what happens in the world ... so that obviously increases your perception of the world being much less safe , " said @entity104 , the @entity111 mom of two			1
it 's harder to parent today , says @entity258 , especially with the influence of media on our children			1
" it 's very , very hard unless you lead a life in a capsule ... even if you home school your children , they are going to be exposed to stuff			1
you ca n't blind them and cover their ears and lead them through and hope they are going to turn out normally as an adult			0
" it could be hard , but we might reduce our stress and even have more fun if we take some notes from our own moms			0
we need to let our kids chart their own course and make their own mistakes , said @entity81 , the @entity83 mom of two			0
" i 've seen toddlers that are already on vegan diets			0
it 's like , ' you 've got to allow them to make their own decisions			0
' " a little wisdom from my own mom : " kids have to learn disappointment , that they ca n't have everything and they ca n't do everything and they ca n't be good at everything			0
" what do you think are the biggest differences between parenting today and back in the ' 60s , ' 70s or ' 80s ? chime in in the comments below or tell @entity309 on @entity310 and @entity311 on @entity74 .			1

moms of all ages agree motherhood has changed over the decades
the @entity142 has given today 's moms more info , but also more *criticism*
many moms lament the loss of autonomy children had in the ' 60s and ' 70s
today 's parents too often refuse to let their kids fail , many moms say
