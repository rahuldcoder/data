-- i carry in my mind a picture of the rev. @entity4 at the beginning of the @entity6 to @entity8 voting rights march on march 21 , 1965			1
what makes that picture so vivid to me 48 years later , as we prepare to celebrate his 84th birthday this month , is that voting rights issues i once imagined were over have resurfaced on a national scale			1
the biggest difference between then and now is that today 's voter suppression operations are highly sophisticated , compared with the crude , racist ones conducted by @entity21 sheriffs and voter registrars through the middle 1960s			1
before the 2012 elections , well - funded efforts in state after state tried to curtail the participation of poor and minority voters by introducing burdensome voter id requirements , despite a record showing individual voter fraud is virtually nonexistent in the @entity33			1
a five - year , nationwide investigation into voter fraud by the @entity37 administration resulted in just 86 convictions			2
at the end of the @entity6 to @entity8 march , @entity4 delivered one of his most memorable speeches before a crowd of 25,000 on the steps of the capitol			1
" our whole campaign in @entity48 has been centered on the right to vote , " he declared			0
" we are on the move now , and no wave of racism can stop us			0
" the beginnings of the march , which came about after violent clashes that pitted @entity48 police and state troopers against civil rights protesters and black @entity59 trying to get on the voter rolls , were more uncertain			1
by current demonstration standards , those of us gathered at @entity6 , a hard town to reach for anyone who did n't live nearby , were few -- 3,200 by most estimates			1
as he moved to the front of the line , @entity4 seemed eager to get started			1
he gave no indication he was worried about his own safety			0
when the march moved down @entity70 , he appeared unperturbed by the counterprotest that seemed jolting to me : a " @entity77 " sign , young kids carrying bb guns screaming " white nigger			0
" @entity4 had , i realized , accepted such hatred as part of his lot in life			2
he could not know that by august 6 , 1965 , the @entity82 would be signed into law by president @entity84			0
he could only hope the @entity6 march changed more minds than were in the rows of us walking behind him			1
the voter suppression efforts that were aimed at preventing president @entity90 from being re-elected in 2012 are a reminder that the decisive victory the @entity82 provided can be undermined if we are not vigilant			1
the @entity94 already has on its calendar a case , @entity97 , that tests the constitutionality of @entity99 of the @entity82 , which requires state and local governments , primarily in the @entity102 , with a history of discrimination to obtain " pre-clearance " from the @entity105 before making any changes affecting voting			0
motivating the @entity110 politicians , who in recent years have sought to suppress voting with tighter @entity113 requirements , is their fear that the demographic tide is running against them			2
we have come 180 degrees from 1968 , when @entity118 in his landmark political study of that election , " the @entity133 , " noted that by virtue of capturing the loyalty of the anti-civil rights whites of the @entity102 along with a majority of voters from the nation 's heartland , @entity110 put themselves in a position to be the dominant party in the country after decades of @entity132 rule			2
in 2012 the tide has shifted again			0
despite taking 59 % of the white vote , @entity135 could not win an election in which the votes of minorities and new immigrants make up such an important share of the electorate			0
republicans , aware that their hostility to such issues as future citizenship for undocumented immigrants and affirmative action has put the majority of nonwhite voters beyond their reach , have sought to do what white @entity21 did before 1965 -- erect voting barriers to preserve their power			2
the voting barriers that @entity4 and the civil rights movement battled in the 1960s had their historic origins in such 19th century measures as the @entity160 of 1890 , in which the state instituted the poll tax as well as the requirement that a voter be able to read or interpret any section of the new @entity166			1
the emphasis on photo ids , which so many poor and minority voters lack because they do not own a car and can not afford to fly , is a variation of this past @entity21 strategy , as @entity174 's @entity132 rep. @entity173 , who was badly beaten at @entity6 during the " @entity176 " protest of march 7 , has pointed out			1
the rhetoric of the @entity178 and the present can even sound alike when it comes to voter registration			0
we need only compare judge @entity183 bragging about how the @entity166 of 1890 preserved the white vote " by @entity186 ingenuity " and @entity188 majority leader @entity187 telling a @entity189 this june , " @entity113 , which is going to allow gov. @entity135 to win the state of @entity191 , done			0
" ( that @entity191 law ran into trouble with a judge and voter ids were not required in the november election			0
) it is easy to imagine @entity4 being dismayed by these historical regressive links , but it is hard to imagine him being moved to silence or inaction by them			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0
