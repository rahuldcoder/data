editor 's note : @entity3 contributor @entity2 is a best - selling author whose new book is " @entity5 : a @entity6			1
" @entity2 says @entity7 , @entity8 , paid an extraordinary tribute to its most dedicated football fan			1
( @entity3 ) -- " yes , it 's all gone now , " @entity11 told me the other day			2
" if you 're not from around here , you 'd never know it was ever there			2
" @entity11 is the sports editor of the @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity17 , a paper with a small circulation ( around 4,000 ) and a small news staff ( five people put the paper out , covering the entire county )			1
last fall , when i was crisscrossing the country on the @entity25 , i spoke with @entity11 about the town 's high school football stadium , which was being demolished			1
@entity29 , it was called			1
the story i wrote appeared briefly on the @entity31 and then went away quickly ; there was so much rapidly breaking news coming out of the presidential campaign that the story was little more than a blip			2
yet i found myself , during the last year , thinking about @entity29 , and @entity7 , @entity8 , and how it 's possible for all of us , if we make the effort , to find the best in ourselves -- to find the best in each other			1
i find myself thinking about @entity29 , and about what that little town did for him , more than i think about almost anything else on which i reported during our long journey through @entity49			1
and so , with a new football season beginning all across the @entity49 , i spoke with @entity11 again the other afternoon			1
" when i drive by the place where it used to be , it 's not with a sense of sadness , " he said			2
" it 's with pride for what this town once did			1
" @entity29 was the core of public life in @entity7			1
the town , population 7,300 , gravitated to the old stadium on friday nights in autumns to watch the high school team , the @entity67 , play their games			1
and who was @entity29 ? a self - made millionaire from the community who had bestowed the stadium upon the town ? a prominent local politician ? a long - gone @entity7 football hero ? no. @entity29 was born in @entity7 more than 100 years ago -- in 1908			1
from the time he was a little boy , he could not walk			0
he spoke with great difficulty			0
his parents , desperate , searched for answers			0
@entity7 was and is a rural community , and back then sophisticated medical diagnoses were not easy to come by			0
his mother and father were eventually told that the boy had cerebral palsy			1
he attended public school in @entity7			0
it was not easy , of course			0
he was 23 by the time he graduated from @entity88			0
then , as now , the boys who were strong and swift and athletically graceful were the ones most celebrated			0
@entity29 could not even take a step on his own			1
but he loved the @entity7 sports teams , and he took pride in supporting them			0
football , basketball , track and field -- he never missed a game , and he seldom missed a practice session			2
he would be there on the sidelines , sitting in his wheelchair , cheering for his classmates			0
his life did n't get any less arduous after he graduated			1
it became incumbent upon @entity108 to support himself and his mother			0
he sold @entity112 cards ; he sold magazine subscriptions			0
at the town 's swimming pool , he ran the concessions stand			2
his philosophy of life , @entity11 told me , was basic : however often you get knocked down , you get back up one more time			2
new generations of healthy and talented young athletes played for the @entity123 on friday nights			0
no matter the weather , no matter how he was feeling , @entity29 was always there			1
the @entity7 football stadium had been constructed in 1925			1
it was the heart of the town ; it was what made the community feel like a community			2
in 1975 , there was a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the stadium			2
on that night , it was renamed			0
the whole town had fallen in love with him			2
all of the quarterbacks who had ever thrown touchdown passes in that stadium , all of the linebackers who had ever made jarring tackles , all of the field goal kickers who had ever won games for @entity7 as the scoreboard clock ticked down ... and the place was renamed for the boy who could never run a single stride			2
as the years went by , when visiting teams would come to town , few of the opposing players would have any idea why the stadium in @entity7 bore the name that it did			1
he never married or had a family			0
he kept going to the games , sitting on the sidelines , right up until his death in 1988			0
the town , by honoring him the way it did , had given his life meaning , and contentment , and joy			1
the decades after his death passed ; the stadium grew too old , too outmoded			2
finally , by last year , there could be no more delay			0
it was time to tear down @entity29			1
the new athletic complex -- @entity180 , it is called -- has risen out near @entity181 328			0
@entity11 , the sports editor , spends his friday nights in the fall covering the games there			0
plans are in the works , he said , to erect a plaque at the new stadium in memory of the lifelong fortitude of the town 's most faithful fan			1
" they want the plaque to be in a place where the @entity7 players can see it as they run onto the field for every game , " @entity11 said			0
" they want to make sure that @entity108 is never forgotten			0
" this can be a mean old world sometimes			0
but other times , when you least expect it , it can light you up			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity29 was a dedicated fan of his small - town football team
he says @entity29 had cerebral palsy and a *challenging* life
@entity2 : @entity29 was n't a football star , a millionaire or a politician
he says town paid him extraordinary tribute by naming stadium after him
