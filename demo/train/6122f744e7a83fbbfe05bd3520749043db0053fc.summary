@entity0 , @entity1 -- the husband of a @entity1 woman sentenced to death for refusing to renounce her @entity7 faith fears for the lives of his family			1
@entity10 is asking @entity12 officials to expedite the asylum process in the case of his wife , @entity15			1
@entity10 says if @entity20 is released early , her life and the lives of his two children could be in grave danger if she has to remain in @entity1			1
@entity1 's foreign ministry denied published reports saturday that officials were preparing to release @entity20 at any moment			1
foreign ministry spokesman @entity25 said he was not aware of any plans to release @entity20 before a ruling from an appeals court			2
" my fear is ... if she is released and asylum has not been granted , " @entity10 said sunday			1
" i am scared for all our lives -- me , my wife and my children -- if we have to remain inside @entity1 , even a day after her release			1
" @entity10 is appealing to @entity39 's @entity12 sens. @entity38 and @entity40			1
" they are working to grant @entity20 asylum in the @entity12			1
" he said he 's hopeful the asylum request can be fast - tracked			1
" i appreciate all their efforts but i want to stress this needs to happen as soon as possible			0
" @entity20 is committed to her religion @entity10 is a @entity12 citizen and a @entity7			1
his wife was condemned to die by hanging after she declined to profess she is a @entity51 , the religion of her father			2
sharia law considers her a muslim and does not recognize her marriage to a @entity7			2
she is unlikely to change her mind despite giving birth in prison , @entity10 said			2
technically , the president of @entity1 can not pardon her , so the judiciary might be the only way out for the government , which is coming under increased international pressure to release @entity20			2
the court convicted her of apostasy and adultery two weeks ago			0
at the time , she was eight months pregnant			0
she gave birth to a baby girl last week at a @entity0 prison , where she 's detained with @entity70 , her 20 - month - old son			0
despite languishing in prison with two infants , she 's holding firm to her beliefs , according to her husband			0
" there is pressure on her from @entity51 religious leaders that she should return to the faith , " @entity10 told @entity2 in a tv exclusive			1
" she said , ' how can i return when i never was a @entity51 ? yes , my father was a muslim , but i was brought up by my mother			0
' " @entity10 said his wife is a practicing @entity7 , more so than him , and even had their son baptized			1
" i know my wife			0
she 's committed , " he said			0
" even last week , they brought in sheikhs and she told them , ' i 'm pretty sure i 'm not going to change my mind			0
' " @entity10 said he is thrilled about his new daughter but hopes her birth does n't hasten his wife 's death sentence			1
in past cases involving pregnant or nursing women , @entity1 waited until the mother had weaned her child before executing any sentence			1
sharia law as practiced in @entity1 prohibits carrying out the death sentence on an pregnant woman until two years after she gives birth			1
@entity2 sought comment from the @entity1 government and was directed to the justice ministry			2
a @entity2 request for an interview was denied , and the justice minister said they do n't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued			0
an attempt to contact @entity1 's foreign affairs minister for comment was unsuccessful			1
woman raised as @entity7 , husband says @entity20 , 27 , was arrested after @entity51 relatives accused her of renouncing her religion			2
their complaint alleged that she went missing for years , and her family was shocked to find out she married a @entity7 , according to her attorney , @entity121			1
@entity10 said he 'd never met the relatives who made the accusations			2
his wife , he said , was raised a @entity7 by her mother , an @entity125 orthodox , after her @entity51 father deserted the family when @entity20 was 6			1
" these people filed charges claiming that she was their sister and filed a police report saying that she had disappeared , " he said			0
at first , @entity20 was charged with adultery for marrying a @entity7			1
the apostasy accusation was added after she maintained she was a @entity7 , according to her husband			2
" the police originally called for the case to be dismissed , but these people went back and added another charge ... which is adultery , by saying she was their sister and a @entity51			0
it is illegal for a @entity51 woman to marry a @entity7 man , therefore we were brought before the court			1
" she 's been detained since january 17 , he said			0
in addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction , the couple also have to worry about their children , @entity10 said			2
" an illegitimate marriage does not result in legally recognized offspring , which means that my son and the new baby are no longer mine , " he said			0
@entity10 's physical condition makes the ordeal even harder			1
he uses a wheelchair and " totally depends " on @entity20 , according to her lawyer			0
" he can not live without her , " he said			0
@entity10 said he 's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added			1
" she 's in a bad mood , " he said of his wife			0
" more punishment in addition to the death sentence , the court sentenced @entity20 to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction			1
the court had warned her to renounce her @entity172 by may 15 , but she has steadfastly maintained she is a @entity7 and will remain so			1
@entity1 @entity174 speaker @entity173 said claims that she was raised as a @entity177 were untrue			2
she was raised in an @entity179 environment , and her brother , a muslim , filed the complaint against her , according to @entity173			0
' i 'll stand by her ' @entity10 said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court 's ruling being overturned			1
" i 'm hoping that , given the way people have come together around the world -- which i want to thank them for , " he said			0
" all the rights groups , all the broadcasters ... it 's looking like it had an effect			0
perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned			0
" but until it 's done , the mother of his children has his support			0
" i 'm standing by her to end			0
whatever she wants , i 'll stand by her , " he said			0
worldwide condemnation rights groups and foreign embassies worldwide have condemned the verdict			0
the ruling also created shock waves in @entity1 , where activists are defying the government and criticizing what they consider an overly harsh implementation and interpretation of @entity179 " the fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice , and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion , is abhorrent and should never be even considered , " said @entity217 , @entity218 's @entity1 researcher			1
foreign embassies in @entity0 , including those of the @entity12 , @entity227 and @entity228 , urged the @entity1 government to reverse course			1
there 's no timetable on when the judicial process will be over , but the couple is n't giving up			2
the appeals court 's ruling could come within the next week , their attorney says			2
until then , they 're grasping at small signs of hope			0
the last time @entity1 executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized @entity245 law			2
@entity2 's @entity246 reported from @entity0 , and @entity247 reported and wrote from @entity248			0
@entity2 's @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
