-- at age 13 , @entity1 struggled in middle school			1
not because her class work at @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , was challenging , but because @entity7 was being bullied			1
her friend , @entity8 , told @entity0 that fellow students would " walk up to her and call her ' slut , ' ' whore , ' and they would sometimes , they would call her ' skank ' and just be really cruel to her			2
" another friend , @entity23 , said , " we had to make like a wall , we had people surrounding her , and she had to be in the middle because people would come by and try to hit her and push her into a locker or something			0
" she was afraid to walk alone , she was afraid someone would do something to her , like verbally attack her , so she would always have someone with her , " @entity23 added			0
this all started in the spring of 2009 during the last week of school			1
friends and family say @entity7 had " sexted " a picture of her breasts to her boyfriend			1
another girl from school , they say , got her hands on the photo and sent it to students at six different schools in the area			2
before @entity7 could do anything to stop it , that photo had gone viral			1
the school alerted @entity7 's parents			1
her mother , @entity47 , told @entity0 how she learned about the photo			0
" the assistant principal had a meeting with my husband and i and pretty much told us that he did not see the image but that he had heard that it was @entity7 and when he confronted @entity7 , @entity7 did not deny it			1
she was n't proud of it but she did n't lie , " @entity7 's mother said			1
mrs. @entity1 says she had warned her daughter about the dark side of technology , about " some of the pretty sexual images of young girls and guys			1
" she added , " @entity7 was very aware of that , of inappropriate dress and most definitely posing			2
" still , because of that photo , @entity7 had become a target for 11 - , 12 - , and 13 - year - old bullies			2
but she did n't share her pain with her parents			0
even when bullies wrote horrible things about @entity7 on a @entity73 page called the " @entity74 " and started a " @entity75 , " the young girl kept silent			1
@entity77 provided a bit of a break , but when the new school year began , the taunting was even worse			0
on saturday , september 12 , 2009 , @entity1 helped her father mow the lawn			1
they cooked a special seafood dinner together as a family			0
then @entity7 disappeared to her room upstairs			1
her parents stayed downstairs and watched tv			0
@entity47 will never forget the moment she went to say goodnight to her daughter			0
" i went upstairs to go in her room and kiss her goodnight			2
that was when i found her			0
i screamed for my husband			0
" it was too late			0
she had used her favorite scarves to hang herself from her canopy bed			0
after @entity7 died , her mother learned her daughter had been summoned to meet with a school social worker			2
a spokesperson for the school says the social worker was concerned @entity7 might have been trying to hurt herself , so she had @entity7 sign what 's called a " no harm " contract in which @entity7 agreed to talk to an adult if she wanted to harm herself			1
@entity7 's mother says she was never told about the contract , which she found crumpled up in the garbage in her daughter 's bedroom after she died			1
school officials told @entity0 they believed the social worker had tried calling @entity7 's mother to alert her but were n't sure if she had left a message			1
" the school dropped the ball , " @entity47 said			0
" the school did not call			0
we have the digital telephone ; we have the cell phones that indicate when there was an incoming call and what number was calling in			0
we have a house phone , i have a cell phone , my husband has a cell phone			0
we have emergency contact numbers at the school which was my sister - in - law and her husband			2
there was no indication that the school called any of those numbers , " @entity7 's mother said			1
days after @entity7 died , her older sister , @entity139 , discovered the bullying was still going on			1
even in death , @entity7 could not escape it			1
" i knew she had @entity73 and @entity144			2
there were people putting comments on there : ' did @entity7 really kill herself ? ' ' i ca n't believe that whore did that			2
' just obscene things that i would never expect from a 12 - year - old or a 13 - year - old , " said @entity139			0
in the year or so that has passed since @entity1 took her own life , her mother has started a group called @entity7 's @entity158			1
she hopes it will help combat bullying and save other moms from feeling the horrendous pain that she feels			0
@entity47 has a message for parents : " it happened to my daughter , it can happen to yours too			0
