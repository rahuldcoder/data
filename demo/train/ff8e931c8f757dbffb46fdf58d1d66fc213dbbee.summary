-- @entity4 president @entity3 has called a high - level judiciary meeting to discuss the case of a rape victim who was jailed because of the attack and has agreed to marry the rapist to get out of prison and legitimize her daughter , the president 's spokesman said monday			1
the meeting , scheduled for thursday in @entity13 , was called in reaction to a petition with nearly 5,000 signatures and media inquiries about the case , said @entity3 spokesman @entity19			1
the woman was sentenced to 12 years in prison after she approached authorities to report that her cousin 's husband had raped her two years ago			1
@entity0 is identifying her only as @entity25 to protect her identity			0
she did not immediately report the attack , fearing reprisals from elements of @entity4 's conservative society and was sentenced to prison for adultery because her attacker was married at the time			1
her sentence was later reduced to three years			0
a spokesman for the attorney general , @entity36 , told @entity0 last week that while the original sentence for adultery was reduced , she had failed to report her rape quickly enough and would have to serve further time in jail for that offense			2
she is now raising her daughter in jail and has agreed to marry her attacker in order to be released and legitimize her daughter			0
she also fears attack from her rapist 's relatives , something he denies is a risk			0
@entity52 , a lawyer for 21 - year - old @entity25 , said the petition gathered 4,751 names in about 48 hours			2
the palace received the petition on sunday , she said			0
it comes with an official plea for clemency addressed to the president , who has the power to immediately pardon @entity25			2
her plight gained international attention when the @entity63 blocked the broadcast of a documentary made about her ordeal saying that it would further jeopardize her safety			0
the @entity69 , while not explicitly calling for @entity25 's release , said thursday that " @entity25 's situation is one no woman should have to face " and called on prosecutors to uphold the law and @entity25 's rights .			1
