-- it must be a bomb			2
that was @entity5 's first thought when she heard the boom as she lay in bed overnight saturday in her home on @entity10 ' @entity9			1
downstairs , she found a ceiling fan plunged to the floor , glass shattered , and the deadbolt of her front door blown open -- not even knowing then her garage doors had been blown in			2
only later did @entity18 and her husband @entity19 learn that , among their neighbors , they were some of the lucky ones			2
a huge explosion had pierced the nighttime silence and ripped through the streets before characterized by solid two - story homes , garages and lawns			1
two adults were killed , while seven others went to area hospitals , due to the explosion and related fires , said deputy chief @entity34 of the @entity35			1
aerial video showed the significant material cost as well , with only the foundations remaining of some homes , others left charred , and dozens more homes like the @entity43 ' suffering damage of all different sorts			1
" the house felt like it was shaking , your chest was shaking , " @entity18 told @entity0 affiliate @entity45			2
" it 's like nothing that you 've ever experienced			2
" fire department spokeswoman @entity52 said early sunday that two houses sitting next to one another blew up			2
but hours later , authorities still had n't determined , publicly at least , why they did			0
@entity57 spokesman @entity56 said sunday there were no reports of gas smells prior to the blast			1
while the personal and physical toll was enormous , some officials are counting their blessings and crediting the prompt , extensive response from public safety authorities -- plus the good fortune that some locals were away for the night -- with preventing even more bloodshed			1
" it was a massive explosion , " said @entity69 , the city 's director of public safety			0
" ... but it could have been much worse			1
" soon after it happened , first responders swarmed on the area -- some of them in shorts and tennis shoes , having apparently rushed to the scene right away , said @entity69			0
at one point , 60 to 70 firefighters were on site to control blazes and prevent more , according to @entity34			0
their other primary duty was to round up residents , as crews " did at least a primary , secondary and tertiary search of every home " to clear people out , he said			1
about 200 neighbors eventually made their way to nearby @entity93 , where doctors and paramedics checked each one , said @entity34			0
@entity18 described the predominant feeling among her neighbors as sorrow			0
" people are just ... in shock , because it is such a surreal thing , " she said			1
after the sun rose sunday morning , the devastation became more stark and painful			0
authorities went door to door at 126 properties in the neighborhood , dividing them into a few simple categories : " ok " for those with cosmetic and survivable damage , other designations for those with an uncertain future , or those that were a lost cause			1
eighty homes were somehow affected , said @entity118 , the deputy code enforcement director for the city , causing an estimated $ 3.6 million in damage			1
most of these had minor damage , in the form of broken glass , torn - off siding or garage door damage , that did n't make their homes uninhabitable			1
another 31 suffered what @entity118 called " major damage " -- meaning , for most of them , it 's still to be determined if they can be lived in again			0
inspectors know for sure that five can not , as they are " either gone or will require a demolition			0
" @entity69 said he expects authorities will discover more damage , and residents will have to deal with more headaches and heartache in the coming weeks			0
handing out his cell phone number to those affected , he promised them they would n't be alone			2
" we understand that their lives are upside down , " @entity69 said			0
" we 're going to do everything we can to help ( re- ) establish their lives , and go forward			0
" @entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0

seven go to hospitals after the late - night blast in an @entity10 neighborhood , officials say
five of the homes affected are lost , while 26 others may not be inhabitable , an inspector says
" people are just ... in shock , because it is such a surreal thing , " a resident says
