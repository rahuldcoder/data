-- reputed @entity2 mob boss and longtime fugitive @entity3 is the defendant in a sensational murder and racketeering trial , but proceedings friday in federal court had one prosecutor choking up with emotion while defending the work of another law enforcement officer			1
and that moment came before a jury has even been seated			1
assistant u.s. attorney @entity14 choked up during arguments in the case as he defended one of his main investigators , @entity19 lt. @entity17			2
@entity14 was responding to a defense claim that one of the key witnesses in the case may have been involved in further criminal activity since his release from federal prison in 2007 , and that a member of the @entity27 claimed the investigation into that defense witness ' activities was compromised			2
in court , @entity3 attorney @entity31 said the state trooper who complained felt " undermined by one of his superiors , @entity17			1
" @entity31 says the trooper was " not only undermined ...			2
so discontent he made complaints			0
" the defense witness , @entity40 , has admitted he killed 20 people as part of @entity3 's criminal organization that ruled south @entity2 for decades			1
he was released as part of a plea deal in exchange for his testimony			0
@entity14 acknowledged in court that the @entity19 state police investigated claims from " sources " that @entity40 was again involved in criminal activity after he was freed			0
@entity14 said the investigation included " numerous interviews " and that the " allegations were unfounded , " calling the accusations " a lot of smoke			0
" @entity14 said the information was turned over to the defense in may			0
what apparently was n't turned over was an additional internal state police investigation into @entity17 's handling of the case			2
@entity14 , addressing @entity67 district court judge @entity66 , became emotional as he defended @entity17 , calling him , " one of the best law enforcement officers i know			0
" @entity14 said the the internal investigation found complaints against @entity17 were " unsubstantiated " and that the " real villain is the state trooper " who he says " went off the deep - end " and denied the allegations when confronted			0
@entity14 said that trooper faces disciplinary action			0
the judge did not rule on whether the defense is entitled to documents pertaining to the internal investigation			0
the conduct of law enforcement is key in the case since prosecutors allege a corrupt @entity85 agent aided @entity3 in his criminal actives while @entity3 himself was a government informant			1
the friday back - and - forth came as the two sides attempt to seat a 18 - member jury , including six alternates , in the high - profile case			2
one hundred and 50 potential jurors whose questionnaires passed muster will be further scrutinized on monday			0
@entity3 was arrested in @entity96 in 2011 after 16 years on the run			1
now 83 , he 's charged in the killings of 19 people during his days as the leader of south @entity2 's @entity102 gang			1
federal prosecutors say @entity3 led the @entity105 mob from the late 1970s through the mid- 1990s			1
but after @entity3 fled impending racketeering charges , investigators found he had been an @entity85 informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges -- a tale that became the inspiration for the @entity113 - winning 2006 drama " @entity114			1
