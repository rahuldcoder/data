-- on friday , first lady @entity1 turns 50 , and the party , we hear , is going to be fantastic			1
there 's even a rumor @entity6 will perform			0
the first lady proves 50 is certainly no signifier of slowing down or calling it quits , even if the @entity9 does consider you worthy of membership			1
the list of other powerful , in - their - prime women and men over 50 is miles long			1
chances are @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , and their many , many cohorts can attest to some of the pros of turning the @entity26 5 - 0 , among them : 1 ) you can forget about contraception			1
although it is biologically possible for many women to get pregnant after 50 , it 's generally much , much harder and less likely : women older than 47 account for just .01 % of births			1
of course , the children you already have might be teenagers			0
many women , like @entity1 , who chose to have children in their 30s will reach 50 with teens living in the house , and might be facing all the stress , angst and struggle that comes with seeing a child through adolescence			1
up next : college tuition ! 2 ) you 're perfectly content to stay home on a saturday night			1
in your 20s , you might have felt a certain self - consciousness -- guilt , perhaps , or anxiety -- if your saturday night was spent in your sweatpants on the couch rather than out being social			1
these days , whether you 're married or single , you might have less energy , but you also know that a weekend night in does n't spell doom for your social life			1
3 ) yes , it 's hot in hereâ € ” those are , after all , hot flashes you 're having			2
while menopause can be a slog lasting as long as 12 years , the upside is not having to deal with periods			2
not to mention @entity64 , cysts , fibroids , or the aforementioned late - in - life pregnancy			2
@entity69 is less common post-menopause			0
besides , there 's nothing like a hot flash on a cold day			0
4 ) fifty years in , you know who you are			0
as @entity1 told @entity78 last summer about reaching 50 , " i have never felt more confident in myself , more clear on who i am as a woman			1
" many people cite their 50s as the best decade , when you know what you want personally and professionally and know -- at least better than you did in your 20s or even 30s , at least -- how to go about getting it if you have n't already			2
5 ) that said , it 's not too late to change direction			0
more and more people over 50 are taking on " encore " careers , reinventing themselves in professions that might more closely align with their passions			2
nonprofit group @entity94 , dedicated to helping professionals find their " second act , " notes that as many as 9 million people age 44 to 70 are getting paid for work that combines their personal passion with a social purpose			0
6 ) mentorship is n't over			2
though the traditional mentor - mentee relationship puts the older , more experienced worker in the teaching role , just because all your mentors have retired does n't mean you have no one left to learn from			1
a recent trend has seen millennials mentoring boomers , teaching them about technology and keeping them current and vital			0
some companies have introduced " reverse mentoring " programs designed to pair younger employees with older ones			0
7 ) you sleep less -- and can therefore do more			0
studies have found that people need less sleep as they age , leaving them plenty of time to go for a run , work on a project , or do anything else your 20 - something cohorts are n't doing while they 're dozing an average extra seven hours a week			1
8 ) you can age however gracefully you 'd like			0
if you 're going gray , you can flaunt it , and you can be proud of your laugh lines			2
but if your crow 's feet or other signs of 50 years well - lived bother you , there are more options than ever before to do something about it , with fewer stigmas attached			1
the @entity138 reports that minimally invasive facial rejuvenation procedures such as @entity140 , @entity141 , chemical peels and the like have reached an all - time high			2
also growing : eyelid surgery and facelifts			0
9 ) you 're your own meteorologist			0
medicine has long disputed that achy joints can predict coming rain , but the old joke may have some truth to it			0
doctors are coming around to the idea , admitting that those with arthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , fibroid myalgia , or nerve damage in the knees , elbows , and other joints -- more likely , of course , as you grow older -- can indeed feel ambient changes			0
10 ) you 're not 60 ! enough said , right ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

@entity165 : @entity1 turns 50 , and shows it is n't about slowing down
@entity165 : the list of powerful , in - their - prime women and men over 50 is miles long
she says : you can forget about contraception . you know who you are .
@entity165 : you 're ok staying home on a saturday night . you can start anew
