-- after actress @entity1 spoke about her sexual relationship with her musician father , online and telephone calls to an anti-sexual assault hot line surged			1
@entity1 told @entity7 that incest survivors are " incredibly underrepresented			1
" her interviews in the past few weeks brought a spotlight to an uncomfortable topic			0
incest , a common but highly stigmatized form of sexual abuse , often leaves the victim ashamed , isolated and unable to tell others what 's happening , because the perpetrator is someone related to him or her , mental health experts said			1
" for any survivor of sexual trauma , it 's challenging , and it takes a lot of courage to come forward , " said @entity20 , director of the @entity22 hot line			1
" with incest survivors , it 's particularly difficult , because not only is there social stigma pressuring them to stay quiet , but also there 's pressure that 's within the family to stay quiet			1
" the @entity36 , which calls itself the nation 's largest anti-sexual assault organization , said it had seen an 83 percent increase in activity on its online hot line and a 26 percent increase on its telephone hot line after @entity45 ' interview with @entity46 aired last week			1
" unfortunately , it 's something we hear everyday in our hot line , so to have somebody speak aloud about it was empowering to a lot of victims and survivors who went through similar situations , " @entity47 said			0
@entity45 spoke about the taboo nature of incest in her interview with @entity0 's @entity7			1
" there 's very little in this world that is taboo today , but this subject is still , like , shove it under the carpet , sweep it away , protect the abuser , deny the reality			0
... you 're just on your own , " the former child star said			0
this makes it one of the most under - reported and least discussed crimes , experts said			1
a @entity76 @entity78 report found that of the 60,000 sexual assault cases reported in 12 states in 2000 , about a quarter were perpetrated by family members			1
about half of the sexual assault cases with victims younger than 11 involved family members			1
at times , a victim may feel unable to tell other family members what 's happening			0
and if he or she tells a relative , that family member may have " a knee - jerk reaction , " refusing to believe it			2
relatives may try to protect the offender in order to keep the family together or to avoid the shame and stigma , @entity47 said			0
this takes a devastating toll on a victim			0
" their sexual selves are damaged			2
their emotional selves are damaged , because ' who do i trust ? ' " said @entity107 , a sex therapist and counselor			0
" ' my father did this			2
who can i trust if i ca n't trust my family ? ' " sometimes the reluctance to report the crime comes from the victim , because he or she does n't want to see the family member in jail			0
although @entity45 called the sexual relationship with her famed father , @entity45 , " wrong , " she said , " i do n't want bad things to happen to him , but i also do n't want bad things to happen to me as a result of this			1
and i was convinced to let it lie			0
" her father , a co-founder of the @entity133 , died in 2001			2
father - or stepfather - daughter incest is the most common form , although it also occurs between mother and child , according to the @entity140			1
a sexual assault victim could suffer physical effects of the crime such as sexually transmitted infections , genital trauma and urinary tract infections			2
they could also experience many mental health effects : social withdrawal , isolation , post-traumatic stress disorder and regressive behavior such as bedwetting and thumb sucking			0
some become hypersexual and engage in destructive behaviors , experts said			2
humans " have an instinct for avoiding incest or inbreeding , " said @entity158 , an assistant professor of psychology at the @entity160 ( @entity161 ) who researches incest			2
but alcohol , drugs and mental illness may disrupt that instinct			0
" under the heavy influence of cocaine or heroin or whatever else you 're taking , your mental boundaries are skewed , essentially , " @entity107 said			0
the offender 's sexual frustrations could also contribute to inappropriate actions			2
" it also depends on his other mating opportunities , " @entity158 said			0
" what is the quality of his current relationship with the female 's mother ? is she around ? what is the ability for the guy to attract other mates ? " the perpetrator , frustrated by the absence of suitable sexual partners , may turn to whomever is around -- even if it 's kin			1
recovery from incest can occur , but it often takes years			1
a victim of incest has to understand that it 's not his or her fault and get professional help , @entity47 said			0
" it does n't make you broken , " @entity45 said			1
" it does n't make it so that you ca n't go on and be -- once you deal with honestly and realistically what you 've been through , it does n't mean that you ca n't be counted on or you ca n't be well enough to be a part of the world			0
