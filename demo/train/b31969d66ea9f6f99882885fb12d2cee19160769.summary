-- in this age of austerity , @entity1 is run by men with wealth that could have leapt from the pages of " @entity7			0
" the president 's worth is estimated at $ 8.3 million , while @entity10 's is placed at a staggering $ 255 million			1
both have tried to make a character issue out of each other 's lifestyle -- conservatives complain that president @entity16 takes too many vacations and @entity19 aides say that @entity10 is living on " another planet			2
" given his wealth , @entity10 could probably afford to buy one			0
he has filed an application to bulldoze his $ 12 million house in @entity25 , @entity26 , and build an even bigger one on top of it			1
how can either of these men empathize with the financial plight of @entity1 's middle class ? @entity1 democracy is saturated with cash			2
last week in @entity35 , gov. @entity34 spent $ 30.5 million to beat @entity36 , who personally raised just $ 3.9 million			1
adding super pac spending , the race generated about $ 63.5 million			1
@entity40 members will say that @entity41 have little right to complain about the amount of money spent on a recall election that they triggered			1
but there 's no denying that the @entity50 's @entity49 decision , which opened the floodgates for corporate campaign contributions , helped @entity34 keep his governorship			1
@entity54 estimates that 14 billionaires gave to the @entity57 incumbent ; only one of them lives in @entity35			1
discussion about the role of money in politics invariably centers on campaign donations			1
but with such gigantic sums flying around , there has to be a cultural impact , too			0
politics has become so saturated with cash that its protagonists have started to feel surreally detached from everyday life			1
on the @entity41 side , there was @entity74 's bizarre ad celebrating her wonderful life and inviting @entity16 supporters to have dinner with her and @entity78			2
for the @entity57 , you may remember @entity10 's attempt to make a $ 10,000 bet with @entity82			1
but the best has to be @entity84 's moving claim that he , too , had suffered in the credit crunch because his house fell 25 % in value			2
before you well up , that 's a fall from $ 2 million to $ 1.6 million			1
everybody suspects that politicians are rolling in money , but a review of the figures might surprise even the most cynical			1
the average citizens ' annual income is $ 49,445			1
in 2010 , the average net worth of a @entity1 senator was $ 13.2 million , and the average worth of a @entity19 member was $ 5.9 million			1
the wealth is spread across both parties : in fact , seven out of 10 of the richest senators are @entity41			0
@entity10 , @entity16 : why they have trouble connecting one side effect is that @entity107 has gained impressive financial and cultural clout			2
in 2011 , @entity107 became the richest city in the @entity1			2
its average income of $ 84,000 is 60 % higher than the national median			2
there are several reasons for this			0
@entity107 is surrounded by rich suburbs ; the government actually grew during the recession , and federal employee compensation averages out at $ 126,000			1
most importantly , the city is a magnet for lobbyists			0
lobbying and campaign work have become big businesses that offer huge dollar rewards to rival the returns of 1980s junk bonds			0
betting on candidates or special interests has become a form of speculation : land a big client and a lobbyist could cream off a sizable percentage			0
then there 's the @entity139 money			2
since 1998 , the financial sector has outspent any other sector in lobbying , to the tune of $ 4.6 billion			0
in 2011 , it employed more than 1,000 lobbyists and spent more than $ 82 million			1
of course , most members of @entity147 earned their money the good old - fashioned way ( including marrying and inheriting it ) , and the voter should n't necessarily hold their success against them			1
one politician who stands out for having a comparatively unsettled financial situation is @entity16			0
yes , his $ 8.3 million is a lot of money , but he comes from an unusually impoverished background , including a period lived on food stamps			1
his contemporary wealth is built on a mix of his salary and royalties from his popular books			0
still the days of the citizen legislator are long gone			0
the intensity of luxury and wealth has to affect the ability of lawmakers to empathize with voters on very low salaries or none at all			0
it 's easy to imagine that the debate over health care reform or the @entity178 tax cuts is affected by the fact that , for many people on @entity182 , the former is an academic question and the latter is personally advantageous			0
this is n't a partisan liberal statement			0
the median identity of a congressman is a rich , white , middle - aged , male lawyer			0
there is a deficit of experience of running a business or trying to survive on welfare payments			0
there is a good case for another round of campaign finance reform , although @entity49 will make any such effort hard to accomplish			0
but even if individual or corporate contributions were limited , this would n't affect a bigger cultural problem in contemporary @entity107			2
government is increasingly run by people who , financially , have little in common with their constituents			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity210 : the $ 30.5 million @entity34 spent to keep his @entity35 seat was staggering
@entity208 says the amount of money thrown around in politics makes politicians seem detached
he says average member of @entity147 is worth millions ; presidential candidates are , too
@entity107 's power elite has little in common with average citizens , he says
