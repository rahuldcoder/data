-- let 's get real			0
the @entity2 have a problem attracting @entity5 voters			1
and @entity6 made it worse			1
not just because @entity6 turned out to express racist views , but because of what he initially , falsely symbolized for some conservative @entity2 : a humble , hard - working rancher who despises federal government overreach			1
the fact that armed militia turned up to protect @entity6 's cattle only made it worse , because it fit ever more neatly into the kind of extremist narrative that frightens many people , including many african - americans			1
they do n't feel comfortable when conservatives , like sen. @entity22 of @entity23 , call the nation 's first black president " the most lawless president in the nation 's history			0
" and they especially do n't care for the kind of inflammatory rhetoric that kind of characterization invites			0
example : " these are dangerous times because this is a lawless presidency and a pliant @entity36			0
the president 's willingness to violate the @entity39 publicly calls into question his fitness for office			0
and that deafening silence from @entity44 manifests a spineless refusal to preserve constitutional government			0
" that was written by @entity48 , who works for @entity49			0
the same @entity49 that repeatedly validated @entity6 and the armed men who chased the feds from government - owned land			1
the @entity53 loves to blame the " mainstream media " for its woes , but if it actually criticized right - wing media when it is clearly in the wrong , it would have more credibility with the very constituents it strives to attract			0
the rev. @entity60 , who heads @entity62 's @entity61 in @entity63 , told me he does n't believe mainstream @entity2 buy what @entity48 is selling , but says , " what frightens me is when those @entity2 who know those kind of statements are absurd , when they do n't speak against it , their silence betrays us from thinking there 's any hope of any partnership with them			1
" in fairness , many conservatives did criticize @entity49 for its support of @entity6 , but other @entity2 , like sen. @entity82 of @entity83 , called @entity6 " a patriot " and only backed away from him when it became clear @entity6 was racist			1
but when the @entity53 's @entity86 appeared on my show , @entity0 's " newsroom , " on friday , he chose to attack me for not sufficiently covering @entity89 who make horribly offensive remarks			1
except we were n't talking about @entity89 , a party already backed by minority voters , but @entity2 and their worthy efforts to attract a broader base			1
the @entity2 is fighting an uphill battle and it knows it			2
in 2012 , 93 % of african - americans voted for @entity98			0
as @entity104 , political scientist from the @entity105 says , " republicans belong to a party that desperately needs to deliver good news and appealing personalities to all minority voters			0
" he adds , " every move that is viewed as an insult is going to make it difficult for the @entity2 to make up ground it needs to win			2
" in other words , @entity6 : bad , bad , bad			2
he says if you take away @entity6 's comments about slavery and focus on what he says about blacks and entitlements : " in many ways what he 's saying is n't that different than mainstream @entity53 ideology and policy			1
republicans in so many ways have codified those beliefs through policy or policy initiatives that are n't outliers -- that are part of the mainstream			0
" @entity132 , a conservative @entity2 who edits the blog @entity134 , says she is disgusted by the @entity6 affair			1
she told me if the @entity53 plan to " widen the tent " included more than community outreach , mr. @entity6 might never have become a " folk hero			2
" " what they ( @entity2 ) need to do is stop looking at black people as this other kind of group , " @entity141 said			2
" we ( @entity5 ) need to be brought into the party at all levels			1
i think if they would include more minorities and women at the table for strategic discussions , you would n't have these kind of missteps because somebody would say , hey , guys , i do n't think we should embrace mr. @entity6			2
let 's do our homework here			0
" other black republicans disagree with @entity141			0
@entity162 , who is a senior staff member for the @entity53 , took exception to @entity141 's assessment of the @entity2 and to my asking @entity86 to address @entity141 's concerns and name some @entity5 senior staff members			1
@entity162 : media 's coverage of @entity6 , race and @entity2 a disservice why is it beneath the dignity of the @entity53 to reveal the results of its much publicized " autopsy " of its defeat in 2012 or its subsequent plan to attract more african - americans ? one of its stated goals is to " ... improve on promoting @entity5 staff and candidates within the party			1
the @entity2 should utilize @entity5 elected officials as surrogates both in their communities and with the national media			1
at the staff level , the personnel should be visible and involved in senior political and budget decisions and not be limited to demographic outreach			0
" hello ! this is politics , not the closed - door deliberations of the @entity195			0
visibility is part of the game , and transparency is an increasing necessity for the @entity5 voter			2
so , let 's get real			0
the @entity2 have a problem attracting @entity5 voters			1
and @entity6 made it worse			2

@entity207 says it 's not a *secret* that the @entity2 lacks strong @entity5 - @entity5 support
she says the party acknowledges that it needs to do better
*incidents* like @entity6 's racist remarks set back the @entity2 effort , she says
@entity207 : it 's appropriate to ask party officials to show what steps they are taking
