@entity0 , @entity1 -- from behind the steel bars of his jail cell , @entity3 described with uncanny ease how he shot and killed his wife , his mother - in - law , and sister - in - law			1
" the first shot hit the side of her body , " @entity3 said			1
" i left her there and went next door and killed my wife 's mother and sister			1
i made sure they were all dead			2
then i locked the door and left the house			0
" without any apparent regret , @entity3 said he would do it again			2
" i am proud of what i did			0
that 's why i turned myself over to the police			0
" @entity3 's confession to the triple - murder that took place last february in a village in central @entity1 is a rare and chilling first - hand account of a so - called " honor " killing -- the murder of women who are usually accused of dishonoring their families by being unfaithful or disobedient			1
@entity38 court convicts parents of murder in " honor " killing @entity3 accused his wife of eight months of repeatedly flirting with other men and spending long hours away from home			1
" my wife never made me happy , " said the 20 - year - old who played drums in a traditional @entity1 wedding band before his arrest			1
" she was like a prostitute			2
she never took care of me			0
" the @entity51 of @entity1 reported 943 women were " killed in the name of honor " in @entity1 last year , an increase of more than 100 from 2010			1
rights groups blame the increase in " honor " murders partly on what they call an ineffective justice system in @entity1 that too often allows killers to go unpunished			1
despite his videotaped confession to @entity2 and an earlier confession to police , prosecutors say @entity3 can soon be a free man if his victims ' family agrees to accept compensation for the killings			1
receiving blood money is an option for victims in many conservative @entity75 societies under the @entity75 principal that mercy is more noble than revenge			0
but women 's rights activists complain that in patriarchal societies like @entity1 , " honor " killers regularly bully and threaten the female victim 's family into accepting blood money			1
" when it comes to the crime we have a natural reaction of shock and horror , but when we see the justice system not work , our heart breaks , " said legal advisor and rights activist @entity86			2
according to human rights lawyer @entity98 , victims ' families in @entity1 are also at a disadvantage because " honor " killings often take place in male - dominated communities where women are often viewed as property with few rights to defend themselves and little access to legal aid			1
" in parts of the country there is hardly any legal help for women , " @entity98 said			0
" this crime is growing because the courts and laws are not responding to the cries for help			0
" @entity98 said police , lawmakers and judges in these communities are too often either corrupt or lack the proper resources and power to investigate and prosecute crimes			0
instead they regularly defer to a traditional system of justice where powerful tribal leaders and male heads of families rule on disputes , he said			0
in 1999 @entity98 set up @entity1 's first hotline for female victims of abuse and families who lost loved ones to " honor " murders			2
he called it the @entity140			0
today @entity98 has help centers in four cities , providing thousands of victims and families shelter , legal advice , and medical care , often free of charge			0
@entity148 suspected in @entity38 " honor " murder ' implicates husband in teen 's killing @entity154 called @entity98 's help center in @entity156 after her newlywed daughter 's husband allegedly killed her for having an affair			2
" somebody told us to come here because they could help us , " @entity154 said			0
" they said they would listen			0
" @entity98 said the fight against " murders for honor " is slowly paying off ; that police are making more arrests , the courts are prosecuting more cases , and the media is paying attention			2
but rights groups agree the steady increase in such deaths and the possibility that confessed killers like @entity3 are often set free are stark signs that the fight is far from over .			1
