-- could a massive passenger jet slip past radar , cross international borders and land undetected ? that 's a key question investigators are weighing as they continue the search for @entity8 , which vanished march 8 on a flight from @entity10 , @entity11 , bound for @entity12			1
radar does have some blind spots , and it 's possible to avoid being spotted by flying at low altitude , analysts told @entity0			1
but experts are divided over whether that could be what happened to the missing @entity21			1
@entity22 , a security consultant and former @entity24 special agent , says someone could have planned a route that avoided radar detection			1
" it certainly is possible to fly through the mountains in that part of the world and not be visible on radar			2
also , an experienced pilot , anyone who wanted to go in that direction , could certainly plot out all the known radar locations , and you can easily determine , where are the radar blind spots ? " he said			1
" it 's the type of things the @entity43 did when they went into @entity44 to go after @entity45			0
" information about the plane 's path came into sharper focus on tuesday , when the @entity51 government released data that bolsters the belief among investigators that the missing jet took a sharp westward turn after communication was lost			1
the @entity51 military was receiving normal flight path and communication data from the jet on its planned route from @entity10 to @entity12 until 1:22 a.m. , when it disappeared from its radar			1
six minutes later , the @entity51 military detected an unknown signal , a @entity65 spokesman told @entity0			1
this unknown aircraft , possibly @entity8 , was heading in the opposite direction			0
@entity11 says the evidence suggests the plane was deliberately flown off course , turning westward and traveling back over the @entity71 and out into the @entity72			1
the @entity51 data corroborate what the @entity11 military had found earlier -- that the plane did indeed turn around toward the @entity77			1
but the @entity51 contact was short - lived			1
" the unknown aircraft 's signal was sending out intermittently , on and off , and on and off , " the spokesman said			0
the @entity51 military lost the unknown aircraft 's signal because of the limits of its military radar , he said			1
satellite signals can confirm plane 's identity on monday , the @entity11 newspaper @entity88 reported that the plane may have evaded radar detection by flying at an altitude of 5,000 feet or less and through mountainous terrain			1
the newspaper cited unidentified sources for its reporting , which @entity0 could not confirm			0
a senior @entity72 military official told @entity0 on monday that military radar near the @entity97 is n't as closely watched as are other radar systems			2
that leaves open the possibility that @entity72 radar systems may not have picked up the airplane at the time of its last known @entity11 radar contact , near the tiny island of @entity106 in the @entity77			2
@entity11 officials said monday that they were not aware of the @entity11 newspaper 's report			0
" it does not come from us , " said @entity111 ceo @entity110			0
@entity43 officials have said they think it 's unlikely the plane flew northward over land as it veered off course			2
if it had , they 've said , radar somewhere would have detected it			2
it 's also unlikely that the plane was landed at a remote airport , since remote airports are n't typically equipped with the long runways that the @entity128 jetliner needs , the officials have said			2
analysts interviewed by @entity0 said that it would be extremely difficult to fly such a large aircraft so close to the ground over a long period of time , and that it 's not even clear that doing so would keep the plane off radar scopes			1
key moments in tracking missing airliner " five thousand ( feet ) is n't really low enough to evade the radar , and that 's kind of where general aviation flies all the time anyway , and we 're visible to radar , " said @entity139 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity43 @entity141			1
" it just seems really highly improbable , unless we 've been overestimating a lot of other countries ' radar system capabilities , " said @entity148 , an aviation and maritime attorney			2
@entity154 , a former @entity155 officer who 's now national security editor for @entity156 , said radar would have detected the plane had it flown over land			1
" this is a bus in the sky			0
it 's a lot harder to get under the radar with this kind of thing than i think most people realize , " he said			2
" so really , while the search i know has extended to this vast area stretching up into ( central or south @entity171 ) , clearly there really should be much more of a search over open water -- because this is not getting past people 's radars			2
" it would n't be easy to avoid radar detection , but some experts say it could be done			1
" anything like this is possible , " radar expert @entity181 told @entity0 's " @entity185			0
" " but to do it , you 'd have to have very detailed information of the type of radars , their disposition , their heights and their waveforms to pull that off			0
" different countries would likely be using different radar systems , he said , but it 's unclear how advanced the technology is in many countries			0
" it took a great deal of skill to do this , " @entity0 aviation analyst @entity201 said			0
" i think somebody was at the controls who understood the value of altitude control to eliminate the possibility of being spotted and tracked on radar			0
" whoever was in control in the cockpit , he said , " really had the ability to map out a route that was given the very best chance of not being detected			0
" one other possibility , he said : the plane could have shadowed another plane so closely that it slipped by radar detection			1
other analysts say that would require so much skill that it would be nearly impossible to pull off without getting caught			0
there 's another possible wrinkle , experts say			0
some countries may be hesitant to reveal what they 've seen on radar			0
" they want to protect their own capabilities , " @entity22 said			0
" their intelligence services are not going to want to publicize exactly what their capabilities are			0
" pilots , passengers under scrutiny politician : pilot supported me , but was no hijacker @entity0 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity51 data bolster belief that the jet turned sharply westward
experts disagree over whether plane could have slipped past radar undetected
analyst : radar blind spots could be determined " easily "
security consultant : someone could have planned a route to avoid detection
