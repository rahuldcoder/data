-- fifteen years ago , a bomb ripped through a federal building in @entity3 , @entity4 , in the worst homegrown terrorist attack on @entity7 soil			1
the april 19 , 1995 , attack killed 168 people , shattering the notion that @entity7 was largely immune to domestic terrorism			2
on monday , homeland security secretary @entity12 traveled to to @entity3 to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the bombing			1
she joined survivors , local officials and others at a memorial ceremony , standing in silence for 168 seconds representing the number of dead			1
in a poignant moment , the names of each of the victims were later read aloud by relatives and colleagues , with speakers referring to their mothers , grandparents and others who died in the bombing			1
@entity31 told the gathering it was impossible to promise an end to terrorist attacks on @entity7 soil			2
" adversaries continue to look for ways to exploit our openness and to take innocent lives , " she said , promising that her agency would continue to work " day and night " to prevent another attack			1
" we can resolve even a successful attack will not defeat our way of life , " @entity31 said , referring to how @entity3 responded to the 1995 bombing with community commitment that has become known as the @entity4 standard			1
" we can resolve that the @entity4 standard becomes the national standard			2
" fifteen years later , the bombing 's impact still reverberates with those who lived through it			2
@entity57 , 37 , who was about seven miles from the @entity58 at the time of the blast , remembers feeling the force of the explosion as he backed out of a parking spot at a grocery store			1
" it felt like i 'd hit a car , " he said of the concussion from the blast			1
" i looked and saw a ton of smoke pouring from downtown			2
" as the day went on , he saw the damage to the building and bodies being pulled from it			2
" it was absolutely horrifying , " said @entity57 , a fourth - generation jeweler whose family 's presence in @entity4 predates statehood			1
" it was horror in real life			1
" an @entity84 veteran , @entity83 , was eventually convicted on federal murder charges in connection with the bombing and executed in 2001			2
@entity83 said he set off the bomb in front of the @entity58 building at 9:01 a.m. , in part , to seek revenge against the @entity7 government for its raid on the @entity96 compound in @entity97 , @entity98 , on april 19 , 1993			1
of the people killed in the attack , 19 were children who were at a day care center in the facility			0
miraculously , six children survived and are now teenagers and young adults			0
@entity107 , now 16 , was 18 months old when the bomb brought the building down on top of him , forcing him to inhale hot air and smoke			1
" his lungs were severely damaged , " said @entity113 , @entity107 's grandmother			0
" it was touch - and - go for @entity107 for a long time			0
" now in high school , @entity107 works with a tutor every week and hopes to study mechanical engineering at the @entity120			0
he also loves sports , but his damaged lungs keep him from taking part competitively			0
" my asthma stops me from running all the time , " said @entity107 , who speaks with a hint of a rasp in his voice between quick pauses to catch his breath			0
" sometimes , coaches would n't want to play me because i might get hurt			0
" despite the hardships and years of surgeries , including numerous tracheotomies , @entity107 said he hardly ever asks , " why me ? " " because to me this is normal , " @entity107 said			1
" as far as i remember , this has been what my life has been like			1
" brother and sister @entity140 and @entity142 were hurt in the attack , although it was the older brother who received the more permanent injuries			0
while then - 2 - year - old @entity142 required 240 stitches to patch her up , her brother -- then 3 -- suffered severe brain injuries , leaving the right side of his body weak			0
" first of all , they said he might not live , and second of all , if he does live , he will never walk or talk again , " said mother @entity152			0
but @entity156 proved doctors wrong			0
he not only survived , but he is now a junior in high school with his sister			0
" when you go through something like this , it just does n't go away , like the next day or the next year			0
it affects you for your whole life , " said @entity164 , who still wonders why she was lucky enough to survive			2
" i wonder , " she said , " but i do n't know , i guess i have something important to do			0
" that sense of destiny is shared by another childhood survivor : @entity173 , now a sophomore at the @entity174 in nearby @entity175			1
" i 've been given like a gift , you might say , and if i do n't make something of my life to succeed and make a difference of some kind , then i would have wasted my life , " he said			1
" i think about the other parents -- all the other day care children and families -- who 've lost someone ... but i feel guilty almost that @entity140 , @entity142 , @entity107 and i , we get to live our lives ... and the other people , they do n't get that opportunity , " he said			2
if anything good came out of the bombing , @entity57 said , it was that the people of @entity3 forged a common bond			1
" it was horrible , but so much good came out of it , " he said			0
" this whole city pulled it together			0
" @entity0 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
