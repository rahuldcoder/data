-- the voice is what you end up missing the most			1
if you 've ever had a friend who has meant the world to you , and the friend has died , you 'll find yourself half hoping to hear the voice even years after the friend has gone			1
i have a feeling that there are more than a few of you reading these words today who know exactly what i mean			2
so it can hit you like a small miracle when , against all odds , the voice of your friend returns			1
@entity21 was my best friend from the time we were 5 years old			1
he died in 2004 at the age of 57 ; a man who was not a smoker , he nonetheless was cut down by lung cancer			1
for all those years , from the time we were boys , we never stopped talking to each other , about big things and small			2
there is not a week that goes by when i do n't want to talk with him again			2
on the cusp of every new summer for the last five years , @entity21 's wife , his daughter and we who were his friends have held a charity race in his memory through the streets of the central @entity41 town where we grew up : the streets he loved			1
we did it again this year , on a warm and gorgeous sunday			2
but there was an additional kind of warmth this year because , in a pair of ways none of us could have predicted , @entity21 's voice was there with us again			1
a fellow named @entity53 discovered an audiotape			1
when we were all 12 years old , @entity53 , it seemed , was a member of the audio / visual club at our junior high school			0
he ran the public address system at assemblies			0
it turns out that he recorded reel - to - reel tapes during the presentations			0
now living in @entity65 , he was going through some old boxes recently and found a tape on which boys and girls were being nominated for class offices			1
@entity21 had not been nominated			0
but he placed into nomination for president a boy named @entity74			0
and now , almost six years after @entity21 's death , here was @entity21 's voice in a way i barely remembered it			1
nervous , proud , high - pitched , the voice of a 12 - year - old standing on a wooden stage : " mr. @entity84 , members of the faculty , and the student body ... as you know , i represent @entity89 ... @entity53 has fine leadership abilities ... @entity53 is kind to all people he encounters , whether it is on the playground , classroom , or athletic field			1
... " the last time i heard @entity21 's voice , he was dying			1
the voice was so weak , struggling for air , filled with sadness that he was leaving his wife and daughter behind			1
so to hear the voice of @entity21 when life was new , for him and for all of us ... well , i listened to that tape over and over again			1
my oldest friend , rediscovered			1
and then i found another version of his voice			1
unbeknownst to me , @entity21 , even in his final months , was writing letters of gratitude to those who had treated him thoughtfully			0
one of the people to whom he wrote was a man named @entity118 ( i know -- a lot of @entity120 in this tale ) , who lives in @entity122			0
i had never met @entity118 , but he sent me a copy of the letter @entity21 had written to him on october 16 , 2004 , barely two months before he died			2
it was pure @entity21 , full of care : " oh , @entity53			0
that 's so kind of you			2
i just ca n't tell you what it means to my family and me to know of your feelings for us			0
although my life continues to become more difficult and it 's harder to see a future that resembles anything like normalcy , i pray that someday we will once again find peace and good health			2
@entity143 bless you for your prayers			0
... " thus it was with those newly found voices in my ear -- the spoken voice of @entity21 at 12 , trying so hard to do a good job at the nominating assembly , the written voice of @entity21 at 57 , using some of his dwindling energy to send his thanks to a man who had been nice to his family and him -- that i arrived in @entity41 for this year 's race in his honor			1
@entity74 -- that same @entity74 who , half a century ago , @entity21 had nominated for class president -- had come to town , too , to run in @entity21 's race			2
he picked me up and we rode over to the starting line together			0
when @entity21 and i were young , there were five of us who were best friends			0
we called ourselves abcdj -- @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity21			0
in the town where we lived , there is a community plaza upon which residents and former residents are invited to purchase bricks with their names carved into the surface			0
before @entity21 died , he purchased a brick			2
but he did n't have his name carved into it			0
instead he had those five initials inscribed : @entity181			0
he told me he did it just so there was " something to show that we were once here			0
" on race day , i walked to where the brick is			0
i think i can just about find it with my eyes closed			0
i looked down at it , and for a moment i did in fact close my eyes and heard again his voice when he was young , his voice when he was dying			1
if you are lucky , and i know that some of you are , you can do the same thing as you think about your own best friends who now are gone			0
in the ways that matter , their voices are always present ; they have a way of finding you just when you need them the most			2
like friendship itself , the voices never die			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 : often it 's the voice of a friend that you miss the most
he recently heard an audiotape that brought back memories of a *lifelong* friend who died
@entity212 : " like friendship itself , the voices never die "
