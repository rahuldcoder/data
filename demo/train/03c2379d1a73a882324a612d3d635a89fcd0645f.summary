-- fifteen years ago i walked out of a mosque in silent protest of the imam 's sermon			2
outside , the heat of the desert sun could hardly match the fire of the rhetoric being spewed forth inside			2
the imam was railing against the foreign enemies of @entity13 and the sinners within			1
with every genocidal rant came an " amen " from the congregation			0
some regrettably came from the heart			0
others came from those on autopilot putting in their " time " at the mosque to fulfill their quota of good deeds			0
still others were a tradeoff : penance for their sins , an economy of convenience that was born long before @entity13 and long sold as the path to heaven of other faiths			1
it was not the first time i had heard terrible notions of fear and hate peddled in the name of my religion			1
but that day was different			0
that day i felt complicit			0
i had reached a point of intellectual critical mass where my love for my religion overwhelmed my sitting in silence any longer			1
as i stood up , i stared at the imam to make sure he knew that at least one person would no longer accept the recipe of his revenge			2
@entity13 and @entity50 were born in the same neighborhood under similar conditions 600 years apart			1
@entity50 came about at a time when harsh rulers subjugated their people , making already difficult lives nearly impossible			2
the people responded to the message of @entity59 as they did 600 years later to the message of @entity61			0
both @entity50 and @entity13 offered simple messages to the poor : live by the rules and your rewards will come later			1
@entity67 : how @entity69 cultures are borrowing from western pop culture @entity13 came of age at a time of open warfare between what was loosely called @entity75 and the occupying @entity76			1
it was a religion for the willing believer , further steeled by the @entity79 of the 11th and 12th centuries and the @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 inquisitions			2
many imams today are still preaching in the rhetoric of the seventh century without regard to contemporary reality			0
but unlike @entity59 and @entity61 , they preach not of future rewards for living a just life as @entity91 promised			2
instead , they offer their rewards to those who devote themselves to the genocide of those who they have anointed our enemies			0
they prefer not to leave @entity102 to @entity91 , instead they substitute themselves as a sort of lower trial court			0
we are now in the @entity108 month of @entity109 , a time of dawn to dusk fasting intended to teach @entity108 about patience , humility , and spirituality			1
during @entity109 , more than a billion @entity108 will congregate at their mosques			1
@entity67 : comics provide a window into our world it is finally time that all of us became more accountable for that which our children will be hearing ; tiny differences setting us apart rather than celebrating those positive things that bind all good people together			1
if we allow small - minded men to spout fear and hate in the name of our religion , we will enable them to brainwash another generation as they did our own			1
and soon , the next generation will fall into a pit of dissonance			0
to sit by silently makes us all complicit			0
as the father of five sons , i worry about who they 're going to be using as role models			1
i worry because all around me , even within my extended family , i see religion being manipulated			2
as a psychologist , i worry for the world in general , but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world			0
now , i 'm a clinical psychologist			0
i 'm licensed in @entity149			0
i trained at @entity151 's survivors of political torture program			0
and i heard one too many stories of people growing up to idolize their leadership , only to end up being tortured by their heroes			0
and torture 's a terrible enough thing as it is , but when it 's done by your hero , that just breaks you in so many ways			0
i left @entity163 , went to business school and started the comic book series " the 99			1
" the 99 references the 99 attributes of @entity91 in the @entity167 , things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom			2
@entity67 : comics of bygone @entity149 fifteen hundred years after the birth of @entity59 , men representing the @entity175 poured hot lead down the throats of @entity108 and @entity179 to get them to accept @entity59 as their @entity180			1
fourteen hundred years after @entity181 conveyed @entity183 's message to @entity61 through the @entity167 , a tiny minority of self - aggrandizing @entity108 are using the lead of bullets to kill untold numbers in an unspeakable insult to name of @entity13			1
today , through the 99 , this proud @entity108 is using the lead of his pencil to take a stand			1
for all our sakes , i hope the pencil really is mightier than the sword			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity198 .			1

a tiny minority of @entity108 preach hatred and *violence* , says @entity198 - @entity198
he says as the father of five he *wanted* to make sure they have the right role models
@entity198 created " the 99 , " a comic series of *superheroes* fighting for positive *values*
those who kill in the name of @entity13 are making an unspeakable insult to the religion , he says
