@entity0 -- the @entity4 is still struggling with an enormous backlog in claims for medical and educational benefits that are piling up despite efforts to diminish the paperwork , the secretary of the department admitted wednesday			1
@entity4 secretary @entity10 says the backlog for processing claims by veterans is too long			1
the @entity4 has implemented an electronic records system , but faces a flood of medical claims each month			1
in july alone , the @entity4 processed 92,000 claims , but another 91,200 came in			2
the department has 400,000 claims in the works , with more than a quarter of them left unprocessed for more than 125 days			0
" regardless of how we parse the numbers , there is a backlog			0
it is too big and veterans are waiting too long for decisions , " said @entity10 , secretary of veterans affairs , in his opening statement to the @entity29 hearing wednesday			1
@entity10 was pressed on the backlog by rep. @entity34 , @entity35 , who asked about the problem of many claims having to be resubmitted			1
the secretary said it was a problem of trust between veterans and the department that he was trying to change , making every employee an " advocate " for veterans			1
" what i mean by advocacy is that when @entity10 walks in and says ' i want to put a claim in , ' my intent is to put together the very best claim the first time with a very high probability of success , " @entity10 responded			2
" whatever is there right now is what we are addressing			0
it is a change in culture			0
it is a change in attitude			0
" the department became a victim of the success of its new education program for veterans who have served since september 2001			0
the claims became so backlogged that the @entity4 was forced to issue more than $ 70 million in emergency funds to veterans who were still waiting for money for supplies and living needs , weeks into the school year			1
" uncertainty and great stress caused by these delays were addressed through these emergency procedures , which remain in effect , " @entity10 assured the @entity29			2
despite the department 's efforts to build a computerized system to process the new program claims , the system was not up and running in time			2
problems facing veterans are even more acute for female service members , who have more difficulty accessing veterans programs , according to the advocacy group @entity89 and @entity90			1
the @entity91 released a study on wednesday highlighting the concerns women veterans have			1
more than 212,000 women have served in the wars in @entity97 and @entity89 , according to the @entity91 , but they face a system that is designed more for the care of their male counterparts			0
@entity4 statistics show that women make up almost 10 percent of the veteran population , but their numbers are growing			1
one area of concern underscored by the report is access to female - specific medical care at @entity4 facilities			0
" for most women , this translates into having a primary care physician handle general health care while a second clinician may handle gender - specific needs , and in some cases , a third provider may address mental health issues , " the study said			0
in some cases , female veterans may be forced to travel more than two hours for routine gynecological care , according to a @entity4 study cited by the @entity91 report			2
at the @entity29 hearing , @entity10 was asked by chairman @entity126 , @entity127 , about women veterans being refused care at @entity4 facilities because there was nobody to watch their children while they were being examined			1
@entity10 assured @entity126 that the issue was being addressed and that no veterans should be turned away for that reason			2
the @entity4 got some good news , however , on its budget			0
on wednesday the @entity29 and @entity138 finalized a bill to provide the department with funding for medical programs one year in advance			0
the move , which still has to be signed by president @entity145 , will assure the department more stability in projecting its ability to provide properly funded services .			0

backlog of claims keeps growing despite efforts to *streamline* , @entity4 head says
backlog " is too big and veterans are waiting too long , " says @entity10
@entity4 secretary tells @entity158 he wants every @entity4 employee to be an advocate for vets
