@entity0 -- tensions between @entity3 and @entity4 have increased this year , particularly over @entity5 and @entity6 , and relations are likely to worsen on the news of the alleged @entity4 plot to assassinate the @entity3 ambassador in @entity11			1
but ironically , the rise of more representative governments in key @entity15 countries poses risks to both @entity4 and @entity3			1
while each country will seek to defend its allies against uprisings ( for @entity3 , the @entity5 ruling family ; and for @entity4 , the @entity6 regime ) , neither will be able to control or dominate the changing regional dynamics -- and both have reasons to worry about the risk of unrest at home			1
the news comes at a time when regional relationships are in flux			0
the ongoing domestic political changes in a number of key countries -- especially @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity6 -- will create new foreign alliances and rivalries			2
it is not yet clear whether these countries will become democratic in the near future , or which parties will be empowered			0
new political players have plenty of domestic challenges to absorb their attention and wo n't necessarily be focused on foreign policy for some time			1
with these caveats , however , here are four predictions about the new @entity15 order			0
1 ) dividing the region into two " camps " is an oversimplification in recent years , many analysts and policy makers saw a " pro-western " camp , led by @entity3 and @entity35 , opposed to a self - styled " resistance " camp of @entity4 , @entity6 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
but new political players will probably want to avoid being forced into these old categories			0
emerging political players in @entity35 and @entity36 , whether @entity68 or secular , generally do not want their countries to look like either @entity3 or @entity4			1
representative governments would not be as reflexively pro-western as their predecessors			0
they are likely to be more pro-palestinian , and more sympathetic to the fact that @entity63 and @entity62 are both popularly - elected movements , but they will also be wary of @entity4			2
analysts have also written about the countries of the revolution versus the countries of the counter-revolution , meaning the @entity81			0
but the @entity81 have backed the uprising in @entity37 and have withdrawn their support from @entity6 president @entity84 -- indicating that they will not necessarily act as a conservative force throughout the region			0
2 ) @entity35 - @entity3 rivalry will be a defining feature in the 1950s and 1960s , @entity35 and @entity3 were major regional rivals , with @entity35 representing @entity91 nationalism , socialism and sympathy for the " non-aligned " movement , while @entity3 was a more traditional , @entity97 monarchy			1
the two countries backed opposing sides in the @entity101 civil war , while @entity35 political philosophy inspired leftist movements throughout the @entity81			0
@entity35 is witnessing a resurgent nationalism and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that @entity3 is unpopular among @entity35 , particularly given reports that the @entity3 king wanted to help former president @entity110 stay in power , which would probably have required the @entity35 military to fire on civilian protesters			1
@entity35 is also the only @entity15 country that can rival @entity3 's influence on the @entity91 media , with the partial exception of @entity118 ( where @entity119 is a single broadcaster rather than a media hub )			1
this renewed rivalry will take time to materialize			0
in the short term , @entity35 's foreign policy is likely to remain constrained by the persistent power of the army			1
at the same time , @entity3 's foreign policy is constrained by domestic preoccupations , including the political succession , and by the fact that key foreign policy players are ageing			1
@entity3 is unlikely to have the capacity to act as a regional " counter-revolution sponsor " even if it wants to			0
3 ) @entity135 will rise as a foreign policy player since 2003 , @entity135 has been consumed with its internal problems and has had little capacity to be a foreign policy player			1
however , this year , @entity135 politicians have taken vocal positions on @entity5 -- opposing the crackdown and expressing their concern about the risk of exacerbating regional sectarian tensions -- and on @entity6 , with @entity135 prime minister @entity146 calling on @entity6 's president @entity84 to end the one - party rule of the @entity149 there			0
as one of the larger countries in the region , with nearly twice as many citizens as @entity3 , and as a major oil producer , @entity135 will expect to be a regional diplomatic heavyweight once again			2
importantly , @entity135 's current oil production targets are likely to create tensions within @entity158 , particularly with @entity3 and with @entity4			2
@entity135 officials have recently said they should revise down their existing ambitious oil production targets , which would see the country producing 12 million barrels a day by 2017 -- more than @entity3 currently produces			0
but even the revised level of eight million barrels a day recently suggested by the oil minister would mean @entity135 produced more oil than @entity4 -- and almost as much as @entity3			2
4 ) @entity15 uprisings pose risks to both the @entity4 and @entity3 models of government while neither @entity4 or @entity3 would be enamored of the comparison , neither is a democracy			2
both have authoritarian governments that claim religious legitimacy ; and in both cases , significant segments of the growing youth population that are dissatisfied with the political and social restrictions that they face			0
@entity4 and @entity3 have backed different uprisings this year			2
@entity4 has expressed support for the uprising in @entity5 , which was repressed with @entity3 help , while following severe state violence against protesters in @entity6 , @entity3 has broken off diplomatic relations with president @entity84 of @entity6 , @entity4 's key @entity15 ally			2
but both the @entity4 and the @entity3 governments have mixed feelings about the political transitions in @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity35			1
if these latter countries emerge as successful democracies -- which is still a big if -- they are likely to offer more inspiring models for future @entity15 development than either @entity3 or @entity4 can offer			1
indeed , it is the lack of existing models in the @entity15 region that explains why so many @entity15 regard the @entity200 government with such enthusiasm			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity206 : dividing region into two ' camps ' is too simple
@entity35 - @entity3 rivalry will be a ' defining feature ' of future
@entity4 will rise as foreign policy heavyweight in region
