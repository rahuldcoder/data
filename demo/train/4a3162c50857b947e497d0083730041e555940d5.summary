-- more than one speaker at the @entity2 alleged this week that a @entity4 presidency would spell financial ruin for @entity6 in four years			1
the claim stems from earlier projections , made before the @entity10 ' health care reform law was passed in 2010 , that @entity6 's hospital insurance trust fund would be insolvent before the end of this decade			1
former president @entity13 led the way wednesday , saying that the @entity16 - backed @entity15 bought time for @entity6 and made it financially solid until 2024			1
he said @entity4 , who wants to repeal the act , would reverse this gain and make @entity6 " go broke in 2016			1
" fact check : the not - so - empty factory the statements : " so , if ( @entity4 is ) elected and if he does what he promised to do , @entity6 will now go broke in 2016			1
that means , after all , we wo n't have to wait until their voucher program kicks in , in 2023 , to see the end of @entity6 as we know it			2
" -- former president @entity13 , wednesday " the plan ( @entity4 is ) proposing would cause @entity6 to go bankrupt by 2016			1
" -- vice president @entity32 , thursday the facts : we 'll look first at @entity6 's financial situation and then @entity4 's plan			1
when officials talk of @entity6 insolvency , they 're talking specifically about the trust fund for @entity6 's hospital insurance , or @entity42 , which covers inpatient hospital stays , care at a nursing facility , hospice care and some home health care			2
the other parts of @entity6 , though costs are rising , are " adequately financed " for now , the program 's trustees say			2
the @entity42 fund 's overseers -- the @entity54 and @entity55 -- said back in 2009 , before the @entity15 passed , that the banked money used to make up the difference between income ( such as taxes ) and expenses for @entity42 would be depleted in 2017			2
but then the @entity15 passed			2
the trustees reported that the act 's lower expenditures ( cutting rates to providers ) and increased revenues ( a payroll tax hike for wealthier people in 2013 ) " improves the financial outlook for @entity6 substantially			2
" the trustees reported in 2010 that health care reform would delay the @entity42 trust fund 's insolvency until 2029			0
by 2011 , the trustees moved that insolvency estimate back to 2024			0
by that date , the trust fund would be depleted			0
but that does n't mean the @entity78 program would collapse			0
revenues would be able to pay for most of the costs			0
the @entity81 , which administers the program , said this year : " projected ( trust fund ) revenue would be adequate to cover 87 % of estimated expenditures in 2024 and 67 % of projected costs in 2050			0
" and even if it got to that point -- in 2016 , 2024 or whenever -- it 's highly unlikely that @entity88 would n't step in to prevent any shortfall			0
the center put it this way : " in practice , @entity88 has never allowed a @entity6 trust fund to exhaust its assets			2
" that would be nothing to cheer , as it could mean even greater budget deficits			0
in an april 2012 paper arguing that claims that @entity6 is nearing bankruptcy are misleading , the liberal - leaning @entity100 says that @entity6 nonetheless " faces serious financing challenges in order to make the ( @entity42 ) trust fund solvent over the long term and to reduce unsustainable federal budget deficits that are driven in part by @entity6 's rising costs			1
" but both the @entity110 and the @entity100 have noted that trustees have warned of pending insolvency for the past four decades , with reports varying from two years away to 28 years			0
" but @entity6 benefits have always been paid because @entity88 has taken steps to keep spending and resources in balance in the near term , " the @entity100 said in its april report			2
as for the present situation , one of the trustees , @entity125 secretary @entity124 , said that without the health care reform , @entity78 would only be able to pay costs in full until 2016 , @entity121 reported			0
so , where does @entity4 come in ? @entity4 calls for repealing the @entity15			1
he also wants to set up a " premium support system " for @entity6 , meaning seniors would get vouchers to buy coverage from either private insurance providers or a government - run @entity6 insurance plan			1
@entity4 's campaign says the voucher plan would n't affect " seniors or those nearing retirement " -- meaning it would n't go into effect for years			2
a similar plan championed by his running mate , @entity143 rep. @entity142 , would go into effect in 2023			0
the @entity146 presidential nominee , while not necessarily adopting all of his running mate 's plan , has said it " makes important strides in the right direction			0
" @entity152 , a senior fellow at the @entity100 , told @entity0 on thursday that repealing the health care reform law would , by itself , return the insolvency date of the @entity155 a trust fund to 2016			0
if @entity4 also delays the voucher program so that it wo n't affect soon - to - be retirees , it will have no effect on the 2016 insolvency date , @entity152 said by phone			1
" as long as he sticks with that ( delay ) , then the premium - support proposal has no effect within the relevant time period , " @entity152 said			1
still , as @entity6 's administrators have said , it 's highly unlikely that @entity88 would n't move to patch up the trust fund past 2016			2
" i presume that , at the end of the day , if gov. @entity4 were elected president , he would figure out some way to make sure that the trust fund did n't become insolvent in 2016			2
but the question is , how would he do it ? because his specific proposal ( repealing the @entity15 ) makes the financing problem worse , rather than better			1
" @entity181 professor @entity180 , a @entity6 historian , said that repealing the @entity15 " would in fact worsen @entity6 's financial condition " and move up the projected date for the @entity42 trust fund 's insolvency			1
but " @entity6 is not going bankrupt , " he said			0
" it would have a projected shortfall in the hospital trust fund and you would need to make changes to address that shortfall , " @entity180 said			0
" but @entity6 would still have most of the necessary funds to pay those expenses , and other parts of the program would be unaffected			0
@entity6 wo n't go bankrupt in the literal sense in 2016 or 2024 or 2064 -- or ever			1
" @entity152 said there were n't enough details about @entity4 's plan to project whether his voucher plan would help the trust fund 's solvency long - term			1
but he did say that under the @entity142 plan , the rate of @entity6 spending growth per person " is somewhat less than what is expected under current law			0
" " it would reduce @entity6 spending , and so it would improve @entity6 solvency			0
but it shifts costs to beneficiaries , " @entity152 said			0
consumer advocates worry that seniors would wind up paying much more for care under the @entity142 plan			0
they point to a @entity217 report that shows spending would be between 35 % and 42 % lower for new enrollees under the @entity205 versus traditional @entity6 , @entity121 reported			0
when asked for a response to @entity13 's criticism , @entity4 spokeswoman @entity220 wrote that under president @entity224 's current plan , " @entity6 will go bankrupt in 2024			1
" " @entity4 has a plan for @entity6 that protects it for today 's seniors and strengthens it for future generations , " she wrote in an e-mail			1
the @entity4 campaign also accuses @entity224 of taking $ 716 billion out of @entity6 to pay for the @entity15			1
@entity4 's campaign got the $ 716 billion figure from a july 24 @entity217 report , which measured the impact of repealing the health care overhaul			2
but the report also notes that the projected $ 716 billion increase in @entity6 spending if the measure is repealed does not signal a $ 716 billion decrease if the measure stays in place -- which is @entity4 's argument			1
conclusion : a repeal of the @entity15 -- counting no other action -- may worsen @entity6 's financial situation and move up the projected insolvency date of @entity42 's trust fund from 2024 to 2016			1
but experts agree that other moves would be on the table			0
while it 's conceivable that @entity4 's @entity6 plans as stated would n't be implemented in time to counter the 2016 projection specifically , it 's highly unlikely that no action would be taken to shore up the fund in the interim			1
fact check : @entity13 arithmetic holds up on jobs @entity0 's @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0

@entity13 : @entity16 - backed @entity15 bought time for @entity6 and made it financially solid until 2024
@entity4 wants to set up a " premium support system " for @entity6 , with vouchers to buy coverage
repealing and maintaining the @entity273 both have consequences
