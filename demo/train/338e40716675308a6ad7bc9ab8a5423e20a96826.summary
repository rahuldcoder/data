@entity0 -- the @entity2 late last month marked a turning point in @entity5 foreign policy			0
did you hear about this summit ? likely not , as headlines focused on the oil spill , the bomb scare in @entity11 and the @entity13 nomination			1
and with the @entity5 unemployment rate at nearly 10 percent , promoting prosperity abroad is difficult for the @entity16 to tout at home			0
still , president @entity18 pledged in @entity19 , @entity20 , last june to build a new beginning with @entity23 nations , and entrepreneurship provides an innovative new tool			1
@entity18 was keeping his promise to deepen partnerships between the @entity5 and the @entity23 world when he invited 275 entrepreneurs from muslim - majority countries to participate in the @entity0 summit			1
selected delegates came from more than 50 countries , including @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37			1
the gathering marked an important shift in foreign policy			0
secretary of state @entity41 , who spoke at the event 's conclusion , said " the summit reflects the new approach to foreign policy that president @entity18 described last year at @entity46 , one that we have been putting into practice through partnerships based on shared values , mutual respect and mutual responsibility			1
" in the past , @entity5 engagement with the @entity23 world has focused primarily on defeating @entity55 , ending the war in @entity34 and deterring @entity58 's nuclear ambitions			1
the summit broadened that strategy along the lines of the @entity62 , which stated that the first phase of our post- 9/11 efforts rightly included military action , but that longer - term success depended on the use of all elements of national power , including economic policy and foreign aid			1
with more than 90 percent of children younger than 15 living in developing countries , engaging the next generation in the @entity75 as well as in @entity76 , @entity35 , @entity77 and other emerging economies is critical for the @entity5			2
the @entity5 needs to find partners in this burgeoning population			0
if the goal of the summit was to get participants to collaborate , the buzz in the room provided a positive indication			2
" people are happy to be with each other , " said @entity88 , founder and ceo of @entity90 , a nonprofit venture fund aimed at eradicating global poverty			2
it remains to be seen if the summit will turn into more than a successful public diplomacy event			2
what did participants gain from attending ? first and foremost , they had a chance to meet each other , build ties , exchange ideas and find others interested in partnering or funding their endeavors			2
@entity105 , a @entity106 entrepreneur , pulled a stack of business cards from his pocket and said , " this is the start of a global network			2
it 's about connecting with people			0
" in their home countries many delegates received media attention for being selected ; for entrepreneurs the chance to promote their organization provides a boost			1
" it is about shining a spotlight on high - impact entrepreneurs , " said @entity121 , ceo and co-founder of @entity123 , a nonprofit that supports entrepreneurs in emerging markets			2
collaborating with an all - star cast of @entity16 officials could n't hurt either			0
the @entity16 rolled out the red carpet with @entity18 participating as well as @entity132 , secretary of commerce @entity133 , national economics council director @entity135 and dr. @entity136 , administrator of @entity137			1
while the administration aimed to " galvanize " entrepreneurs from muslim - majority countries , these @entity23 upstarts shied away from pigeon - holing into a religious or ethnic category			1
when asked to define " muslim entrepreneur " in a panel discussion , @entity144 business woman @entity143 said , " there is no difference between a @entity23 entrepreneur and any other entrepreneur			1
an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur			0
" for the @entity16 , the purpose of the conference was to send a political message of collaborative engagement			2
for summit delegates , however , the focus was on building their fledgling businesses			2
noticeably absent from the summit were @entity5 entrepreneurs			1
of the @entity5 participating , most represented @entity5 government , not business			0
and , for @entity23 entrepreneurs , the absence of their @entity5 counterparts was a disappointment			1
for many , the conference still marked a paradigm shift in public policy			0
" @entity18 has turned his @entity19 vision into a reality , " said @entity170 , founder of @entity171 and a @entity172 from @entity173			1
" at the same time , he has advanced the culture of entrepreneurship to an inflection point			0
" the summit spurred companion events outside of government			0
in the same week , more than 30 partner organizations hosted events in @entity0 , including @entity184 , @entity185 , the @entity186 , the @entity187 , the @entity188 and @entity189 in @entity190			0
as for next steps , @entity18 announced the administration 's plans to launch exchange programs to bring entrepreneurs from @entity23 countries to the @entity5 and send their @entity5 counterparts to muslim - majority countries			1
the prime minister of @entity200 said he will host the next entrepreneurship summit , set to become an annual event			1
@entity203 announced an upcoming social entrepreneurship conference in @entity34			0
@entity132 announced four initiatives : -- the @entity206			0
-- partnerships with two @entity208 - based incubators			0
-- the launch of @entity210			0
-- a new effort called @entity212			0
these initiatives all aim to further catalyze ongoing collaboration through sharing of best practices			0
entrepreneurship is the new global engagement			1
last month , the @entity5 reached out to upstarts in hopes that they will become new diplomats for change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			1
