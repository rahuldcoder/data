-- " i did not really realize i was getting life until the date of sentencing			2
when my attorney told me , i told him that i wanted to take back my guilty plea ... they denied me			0
" @entity8 says his life ended when he was 23 - years - old			1
that was two decades ago , when he was arrested and later sentenced to a mandatory double - life term in prison without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to possess lsd with intent to distribute			1
a self - described " deadhead , " @entity8 was busted after mailing five grams of the hallucinogenic drug to a friend who was working as an informant for the federal government			1
he 's had more than 20 years to fixate on that moment , years of " what ifs " and " whys			0
" more than 20 years of feeling like he died , until now			0
changes on the horizon though the @entity31 administration has been campaigning for prison reform for some time , it has recently begun to take concrete steps to alleviate overcrowded federal prisons that are flooded with non-violent offenders			1
the @entity36 announced changes to its clemency criteria this week , a move that will likely lead to a wave of sentence commutation requests being sent to president @entity31 by thousands of prisoners who 've been convicted of non-violent drug crimes			1
" we are launching this clemency initiative in order to quickly and effectively identify appropriate candidates , candidates who have a clean prison record , do not present a threat to public safety , and were sentenced under out - of - date laws that have since been changed , and are no longer seen as appropriate , " deputy attorney general @entity44 said at a news conference wednesday			1
the clemency changes would be open to prisoners who have met a set of specific conditions : they must be low - level , non-violent offenders without a significant criminal history and must be serving a federal sentence that would likely be shorter if they were convicted today			1
they must have served at least 10 years of their sentence and have demonstrated good conduct in prison , with no history of violence before or during their prison term			2
the pending changes are the latest step in an ongoing effort attorney general @entity69 calls " @entity70 , " which also seeks to remedy the once - common wide disparity in sentences handed down over powder versus crack cocaine , based on guidelines first enacted by @entity76 more than 25 years ago			2
in january , @entity69 urged @entity76 to pass the bipartisan " @entity77 , " which would allow judicial leniency in the sentencing of those convicted of federal non-violent drug crimes			1
and in april , the @entity82 voted unanimously to back a @entity36 proposal to change the sentencing formula for drug offenders that could shorten prison stays for as many as 70 % of federal drug defendants			1
" this reduction in the federal sentencing guidelines , while modest , sends a strong message about the need to reserve the harshest penalties for the most serious crimes , " @entity69 commented			2
of the more than 200,000 inmates in the federal prison system , some estimates show the new clemency criteria could apply to about 2,000 prisoners			1
but the number is likely to fall to perhaps hundreds after government lawyers review the applications			0
sentencing guidelines the history of federal mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses dates back to the 1950s , when a mandatory 10 - year sentence could be imposed for crimes such as selling heroin to a juvenile			1
in the 60s , then - president @entity111 proposed sentencing reforms that would eventually result in nearly all mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses being repealed			2
but the alarming rise of cocaine use , particularly crack cocaine , in the 1980s sent @entity76 scrambling to react to the epidemic and prompted the hasty revival of the laws that had been viewed so unfavorably two decades before			0
though the primary goal of legislation such as @entity123 was to target and successfully prosecute " kingpins " or major drug traffickers , thousands of low - level offenders , like @entity8 , have been swept up and imprisoned based on outdated guidelines			1
while he understands why some may have trouble sympathizing with a three - time drug offender , @entity8 offers perspective			1
" a life sentence , people do n't really understand it			2
a man raped his daughter , got probation			0
a man killed people with his car , got probation			0
if they did 10 days in jail they would understand ... they ca n't comprehend			0
" in 1991 , @entity8 was a fixture in the @entity149 fan community			1
his days were often spent crisscrossing the country alongside fellow " deadheads			0
" now , his days are spent alongside convicted murderers and rapists , his nights locked down at 9:45 p.m. " i actually thought that i would get 262 months - 327 months , which is a lot of time , but it had a release date , " he explained			0
@entity8 was arrested on his way to a @entity149 concert in @entity161 and was eventually extradited back to @entity162 , the state in which he mailed his lsd delivery			1
on the day he was sentenced , he tried his best to conceal his emotions for the sake of his sister , who was present in the courtroom			0
but " once i walked out of the courtroom while seeing my sister 's eyes tearing up , i could not hold back my own , " he remembered			0
crack cocaine at heart of once - common sentencing disparity would n't take plea deal @entity8 was initially offered a plea bargain with a 10 - year sentence in exchange for testimony against his co-defendants			1
had he accepted the deal , he would have been released about 10 years ago			0
but the decision was n't that easy			0
one of his co-defendants was his own father			0
@entity8 maintains that his father had never ingested lsd , but like his son , was only assisting a friend in obtaining the drug			1
@entity8 did not testify against his father , who was convicted on a lesser offense			1
" my dad was just helping his friend acquire some because he knew i was able to get it , " @entity8 told @entity0 over the phone from @entity191 in @entity192			1
" he certainly did not think he could get 10 years for a simple envelope			0
" admittedly , @entity8 was an avid user of @entity197 and was often called upon by friends to procure the illegal drug , which was often in abundance at @entity149 concerts			1
" when i was arrested , me and my friends considered @entity197 to be sacred or a sacrament , " he said			0
and though his two previous encounters with law enforcement for similar crimes had resulted only in probation , his third offense triggered the federal government 's mandatory sentencing guidelines that would ensure he never spends another day as a free man			2
according to @entity8 , his public defender never explained to him the federal minimum mandatory guidelines , and by the time he did learn about them , it was too late			1
the guidelines did not allow the judge to take into consideration @entity8 's age , mental state , drug addiction , or the absence of violence when he decided his punishment			1
the guilty plea he thought would soften his sentence and spare his father effectively ended @entity8 's chances of ever stepping outside of prison again			1
" i loved my father just like i loved my adopted family at the concerts , so i could not go against him or them			0
" following sentencing they sat together in prison , father and son , contemplating the bleak future that awaited them both			2
" he did tell me after sentencing while we were in the same jail together that he would not live long enough to complete his sentence , " @entity8 remembers			1
his father 's premonitions proved true when he passed away in federal prison in april of 2001 , with only 18 months left to serve			2
does the punishment fit the crime ? @entity8 's supporters -- including his most ardent advocate , his sister @entity250 -- do n't think his punishment fits his crime			2
" i do n't think i 've done more wrong to society than has been done to me , " @entity8 explains			2
he ca n't help but get emotional thinking of his father			0
" my dad died in prison , how much blood does society feel they need ? " many of his supporters believe that minimum mandatory sentencing is an inhumane and inefficient way to fight the war on drugs			0
more than 300,000 people have signed a change.org petition calling for clemency in @entity8 's case			1
in addition , groups such as @entity270 , the @entity271 , and the @entity272 are lobbying for his release			0
" people have been becoming more aware , evolving it seems			0
based on that and the current president and attorney general holder , maybe there is hope for others too because there are about 3,700 others who are doing life for non-violent [ offenses ] , " @entity8 explains			1
and though legislation such as the " @entity77 " is a perfect example of the turning tide on the issue , @entity8 says only one person can help him gain his freedom			2
" the only thing i can wish for now is a commutation of sentence from the president			0
" considering that @entity31 issued clemency in december of 2013 for eight non-violent drug offenders , and the recent changes in clemency criteria , this is n't out of the realm of possibility			1
while daydreaming about freedom may be a nice thought for @entity8 , he 's cautiously optimistic about his chances of actually being released			2
" i never thought about it ' til recently			0
i never thought about it but i have some supporters out there and maybe i will			0
i know my sister is wishing that would happen			0
" as he waits , @entity8 -- or inmate # 99672 - 012 -- takes it one day at a time			2
" i hold out , live day to day , stay healthy , keep a positive attitude			0
" " i can beat any man around in handball , which is a big thing in prison			0
" rules change means more drug offenders eligible for clemency @entity0 's @entity322 contributed to this report .			1
