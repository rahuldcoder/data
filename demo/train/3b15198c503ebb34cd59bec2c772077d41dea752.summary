@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 was traveling in @entity4 when he saw , for the first time , hundreds of children without shoes			1
toms founder and entrepreneur @entity3 says he wanted to make money and do good at the same time			1
" i had never met anyone who did n't have shoes , " the veteran entrepreneur told @entity2			0
that visit to a village in @entity15 inspired the creation of a socially responsible footwear company that blends philanthropy and business			2
@entity3 called the company toms : @entity21 -- a name that reflects his desire to provide shoes for disadvantaged children in a sustainable way			1
@entity3 , now 32 , said he realized he could make money and do good at the same time with @entity28			1
the company 's mission is uncomplicated : it gives a free pair of shoes to a child in need every time it sells a pair			1
@entity39 , @entity40 - based toms gave away 10,000 pairs of shoes in the first six months after its launch in 2006			2
this year the company is on track to donate 200,000 pairs			1
the stylish slip - ons , which @entity49 declared " cool shoes for a cool cause , " have become a must - have item among fashion elite and received the @entity56 's @entity55 from the @entity58 's @entity57 last year			2
by the time he launched toms , @entity3 already had four start - ups under his belt			2
but he did n't always have his sights set on the business world			0
growing up , his aim was to play professional tennis			0
he trained hard and earned a scholarship to @entity66 , where he studied philosophy and finance			0
but an injury sidelined him his sophomore year			0
that 's when he got the idea for his first venture , a college laundry service			0
within one year , the business , @entity76 , had 40 employees , had expanded to three schools and was generating nearly $ 1 million in sales			0
that 's when @entity3 realized he was born to be an entrepreneur and dropped out of school			2
" i realized i loved doing this			0
i realized i loved the idea of creating something out of scratch and seeing it work and seeing the benefits of that , " he said			0
@entity3 eventually sold the company and began other ventures , including an outdoor advertising company and a 24 - hours - a - day , 7 - days - a - week reality tv channel , which he launched after appearing on the second season of " @entity95 " with his sister			1
they finished the competition in third place ( missing out on the million - dollar prize by just four minutes ) , but the experience exposed @entity3 to the astounding amount of poverty in the world -- a problem that @entity28 is tackling today , one pair of shoes at a time .			1

entrepreneur @entity3 is blending philanthropy with business
he is the *designer* and self - titled " chief shoe giver " at @entity28
his company gives away a pair of shoes for every pair it sells
@entity28 expects to donate 200,000 pairs of shoes to children in need this year
