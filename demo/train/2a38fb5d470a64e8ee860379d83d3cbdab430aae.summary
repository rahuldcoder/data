@entity1 , @entity0 -- the concept may be radical , but it might just have to be if the worst predictions of climate change are realized			1
the @entity6 as imagined by architect @entity7 moored off the coast of @entity9			1
the @entity6 , a floating ecopolis for climatic refugees , is the creation of @entity14 architect @entity7			1
" it is " he says , " a true amphibian , half aquatic and half terrestrial city , able to accommodate 50,000 inhabitants and inviting biodiversity "			1
@entity19 imagines his structure at 250 times the scale of a lilypad , with a skin made of polyester fibres coated in titanium dioxide which would react with ultraviolet light and absorb atmospheric pollution			1
the @entity6 comprises of three marinas and three mountain regions with streets and structures strewn with foliage			0
" the goal is to create a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature , " said @entity7			1
with a central fresh water lagoon acting as ballast , the whole construction would be carbon neutral utilizing solar , thermal , wind , hydraulic , tidal and osmotic energies			2
with high density populations living in low - lying areas -- the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 -- the ecopolis , its creator believes , could be the answer to mass human displacement that global warming is predicted to cause			2
in its most recent 2007 report the @entity54 predicted sea levels will rise by 60 - 90 cm during this century			0
some climate scientists like @entity58 think that if greenhouse gas emissions are n't checked then those figures might be much , much worse			2
in practice , @entity19 envisages the @entity6 sailing the seas , following currents like a futuristic cruise ship			0
he also thinks that it could " widen sustainability in offshore territories of the most developed countries such as @entity9 "			0
you ca n't help thinking that the well - heeled residents of the @entity72 might have a thing or two to say about 50,000 climatic refugees bobbing around in the harbour , but you can not fault @entity19 's ambition			1
his previous creations -- showcased on his website -- reveal an imagination working at full throttle with sustainable design lying at its heart			0
@entity83 -- a prototype of depolluting architecture and @entity86 -- an ecotower rising up from the foundations of @entity90 ruins are two further examples of his eco design credentials			0
the @entity93 , @entity94 in @entity95 and the @entity96 may sound like titles for various genres of novel but are , in fact , names for sustainable projects in @entity19 's growing portfolio			0
now all he needs is to find someone brave enough to build on the vision he has created .			0

@entity14 architect imagines climate refugees living on a futuristic @entity110
the structure would support 50,000 inhabitants in a zero carbon *environment*
the goal is to " create a harmonious coexistence of humans and nature "
