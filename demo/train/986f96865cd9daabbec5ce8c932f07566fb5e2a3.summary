@entity0 has lived in the village of @entity2 , close to @entity4 's border with @entity5 , all his life			1
@entity0 , 67 , was born a few years after the @entity7 recaptured this land -- and the strategic hill of @entity10 nearby -- from @entity12 forces			2
he is a stoic man , a farmer who knows endurance			2
but the events of the last few months reduce him to tears			2
on july 28 , amid battles between @entity4 forces and @entity21 separatists for the area , a sniper from the @entity17 shot dead @entity0 's 36 - year - old son as he tried to move his car to safety			1
" they said they thought he was a separatist , " he says , wiping his eyes			2
" they apologized later , and a soldier helped bury him			0
" the inadequacy of the gesture goes unsaid			0
in june , when we last came here , @entity34 was a neat village set in rolling farmland			0
its people were poor but they had work and enough to eat			0
now , as bitter winds blow in from the east , much of the village is in ruins			0
a decapitated @entity4 tank sits astride the one road , electricity wires dangle in the wind , and 20 or more properties have been reduced to ruins , including @entity0 's			1
he and his wife are the only members of their family left in @entity34			1
they have nowhere to go , no electricity and little food			1
@entity0 says the @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , now in complete control of this area , has promised to restore power , but there is no sign of the extensive work that will be needed			1
and in a few weeks ' time , the temperature here will rarely stray above freezing			0
the wreckage of this year 's battles is strewn around @entity34 and many other villages in eastern @entity4			1
the copper of spent bullets gleams in the wintry sun , sandbags sag over deserted trenches , and the husks of tanks and other military vehicles slowly turn from green to rust			0
and everywhere homes are reduced to piles of charred bricks			0
a fireplace stands incongruously in empty space ; shattered windows creak on their hinges			0
dogs left to fend for themselves wander through piles of garbage			2
the ceasefire agreed at the beginning of september only slowed the tempo of the fighting in eastern @entity4 , and sometimes barely that			1
huge volumes of ordnance have been spent in a stalemate at @entity99 , long a target of the rebels , where the control tower has been hit so many times it should no longer be standing			1
further east , around the important crossroads and rail junction at @entity105 , some thirty @entity4 volunteers from the capital peer into the freezing mist			1
they occupy a slim finger of @entity4 - held land , surrounded on three sides			1
some of the men have been here for two months			0
every day they are attacked , they say , but so far they have held the position and have built themselves underground shelters against the biting cold			0
but they do n't have the resources or support to withstand a serious offensive			0
in the nearby town , a stream of laments : " the young people have left ; we are on our own " ; " the shelling is every day , by both sides			2
" and from one man shuffling past burned - out houses : " i do n't care which flag flies here ; i just want peace			2
" seventy - three - year - old @entity137 arrived in @entity138 from her village when it came under fire , bringing only what she could carry			2
looking down at her threadbare boots , she says she is so terrified of the shelling that she feels like her heart will jump from her body			0
she 's too scared to eat or sleep			2
peace seems unlikely as the ceasefire frays and the rhetoric gets ever more hostile			0
@entity4 appears to be in the throes of a vicious divorce			1
prime minister @entity152 says there will be no direct negotiations with the rebels , calling them @entity157 's mercenaries			1
president @entity158 has ordered the withdrawal of all state services in " occupied " areas , which includes social welfare payments and state salaries for teachers and doctors			1
and @entity166 , the self - declared prime minister of luhansk -- the @entity59 's sister republic -- has challenged @entity158 to a duel " following the example of ancient @entity171 chieftains and glorious cossack atamans			1
" while the chest - beating goes on , @entity99 's neediest line up at the city 's former circus to be registered for food handouts by a volunteer organization			1
they stand under posters of trapeze artists and lions to collect a big bag of groceries , but can only come here every two weeks			0
most of these people are elderly ; there are a few single mothers with anxious eyes and haggard faces			0
the food -- transported from beyond the @entity59 -- is provided by steel magnate @entity192 , once the most powerful man in the @entity195 but now in @entity196 after falling out with the separatists and supporting @entity4 's unity			1
long queues snake through @entity99 bus station as people try to leave the city			1
many are trying to register themselves in government - held areas so they can get pension payments , but must make the sometimes perilous return journey every few weeks			1
most ca n't afford to live anywhere else			0
there are no banks left open in the city and no cash machines working			1
districts like @entity214 have been shelled so heavily they are reminiscent of the battle for @entity216 , the @entity217 capital , in the mid- 1990s			2
in the bomb shelters to which many people retreat at night , outbreaks of skin diseases are reported among the children			0
the @entity58 is promising its own system of payments to people here but is woefully short of the administrative skills needed to run a region nearly the size of @entity230			0
it does however have its own souvenir mugs , and has symbolically adopted a different time zone from @entity196			1
there is a genuine animosity among people in @entity195 toward the government in @entity196			1
the @entity17 is widely hated ; people accuse the army of random shelling			0
and the withdrawal of benefits and salaries on the cusp of winter has left many in despair			2
at the same time , people grumble about the inability of the @entity59 to help them , and lament its lack of basic organization			2
some small protests have taken place in towns like @entity254 , close to where the @entity256 airliner was shot down in july			0
while @entity4 's divorce gets ever uglier , the ordinary people of the @entity195 focus on survival , on a hand - to - mouth existence , without the means to escape the violence that has torn apart their lives for the last nine months			1
one of them , a fragile stooped woman who tells us she is 83 , stands outside the last working @entity4 bank in @entity99 , as others hammer on its door			1
today it too will remain shuttered			0
" i have no money , " she says			0
" i 'll probably die because i have nothing to eat			0

the battle between the government and separatists for eastern @entity4 is taking its toll on the area 's residents
@entity4 's president has cut off social services in " occupied " areas , and many in @entity99 are *starving*
there are no banks left open in the city ; residents in the city line up for food handouts driven in from beyond the city
@entity99 's residents resent @entity4 's @entity196 - based government , but deplore the rebels ' inability to help them
