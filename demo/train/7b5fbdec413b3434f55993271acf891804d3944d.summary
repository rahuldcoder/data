@entity0 -- while administrations come and go , and power in @entity5 teeters between political parties , one thing remains constant in the lives of @entity0 's , elite : the power lunch			1
between noon and 2 p.m. , brokers meet to clinch deals , with the emphasis more on power than on lunch			1
just steps from @entity15 , @entity16 is one of the places to see and be seen at lunchtime			1
depending on the week , the modern @entity20 steakhouse serves between 70 and 80 congressmen and between 20 and 30 senators			0
" i 'd bet we 've had every member of @entity5 and every senator in the restaurant at some point , " says @entity23 , executive chef for the famed eatery			1
it 's not just the proximity to @entity15 that draws @entity0 's elite to @entity16			1
the restaurant has several private dining areas -- including a rooftop with scenic views of the city -- and an executive chef who prides himself on serving homemade , inventive fare			1
" we do anything , we 've got senators from @entity43 that come in , and they ask for @entity46 hors d'oeurves , we 've got , you know , people from @entity49 that ask for things from @entity49 , " @entity23 says			0
" so , we can really vary the menu , and it makes it interesting for me to try to come up with new ideas			0
" thirty - seven years ago , @entity55 moved to @entity0 with his brother and built @entity57 with his bare hands			1
now , as executive director of the famed power spot , @entity55 is known by @entity0 's elite as the keeper of the keys to @entity57			1
" it 's pretty frightening , yeah , you ca n't even walk down the street sometimes , @entity55 said			1
" people say , ' hey , @entity69 ! put me down for two at 12:30 , ' and i do n't even know who the hell they are			0
" the @entity57 has hosted every president from @entity75 to @entity76			1
president @entity77 has yet to make a visit			0
but it 's not just presidents who visit @entity57			1
@entity82 chief of staff @entity81 has frequented the restaurant since the @entity76 administration			1
cabinet secretaries including @entity86 , administration officials , senators and representatives , @entity91 justices , the city 's top lobbyists , lawyers , strategists and media elites are all regulars at the @entity98 steakhouse			1
and if you become a regular , you get your picture on the wall			0
" people used to think when we first opened up that we had all the [ portraits of ] @entity105 on one side and all the [ portraits of ] @entity108 on the other side , " @entity55 said			0
" it 's not really as much thought behind it			2
it just goes up , it 's good customers , loyal customers , famous people , infamous people , and i decide where i want to put them when i get the chance , " he joked , pointing out the minimal space left on the wall			2
not everyone is willing to put their picture on the wall			0
@entity121 and @entity122 , who are political strategists and @entity1 contributors , chose to have their dogs ' portraits on the wall instead of their own			0
while steakhouses remain a favorite , not all power restaurants dish out filet mignon			2
steps from the @entity82 are three of @entity0 's oldest power spots : the @entity135 , which serves up @entity20 fare ; @entity137 , which is @entity138 ; and @entity139 , which also specializes in @entity20 cuisine			1
cafe @entity141 , in @entity143 , and the @entity144 and @entity146 's @entity145 , on @entity15 , also remain abuzz with some of the most prominent people in @entity0			1
italian restaurant @entity148 on 14th @entity150 has become a favorite among younger administration staffers because of its laid - back atmosphere and expansive dining room			0
@entity148 's sister restaurant @entity157 , owned by @entity158 , has kept @entity0 's top lobbyists and politicians coming back since it opened in 2001			1
not only known for the power scene and homemade @entity164 cuisine , @entity157 has set itself apart from others by having some of the most attentive waitstaff in the city			2
@entity91 justice @entity169 , known by friends as a big foodie , has dined at @entity157 , as have @entity81 and @entity77 adviser @entity172			2
the @entity173 reported that former sen. @entity174 convinced then - freshman sen. @entity77 to run for president at the @entity164 eatery			0
the newest member of the @entity91 , justice @entity178 , is known by friends as a " very adventurous diner			2
" she is a fan of @entity182 @entity181 , in @entity183 , which serves up @entity185 fare			0
serving up inventive sushi dishes like a fish - and - chips roll , or wasabi guacamole with wonton chips , @entity186 in @entity187 has established itself as a newcomer to the power scene , along with its neighbors @entity195 and @entity196 -- all reported to have recently hosted first lady @entity77			2
" one of the things that 's been sort of fun to watch over the course of this year is the @entity206 have eaten out in a wide variety of places , " says @entity198 , editor of @entity200 magazine			2
" you 've seen them come and get burgers up here on @entity213 , you 've seen them go out for burgers in @entity216 , you 've also seen them go out to some of the nicest restaurants in the city , like @entity221 and @entity222 , where they went this fall for their anniversary dinner			0
but then you see @entity225 eating on his own -- he 's going to a place like @entity227 or he 's going to a place like @entity229			0
" @entity198 points out one top restaurant at which the @entity206 have yet to dine			0
" they still have n't been to what is widely considered to be the city 's best restaurant , which is a small @entity236 place near @entity98 called @entity237 , " @entity198 said			0
" but one of the challenges with a place like @entity237 is that it 's very small and books up far in advance , so it might be hard for the @entity206 to sort of drop in there like they 've been dropping in at a lot of these other restaurants			0

the power lunch is a constant of @entity0 's elite
