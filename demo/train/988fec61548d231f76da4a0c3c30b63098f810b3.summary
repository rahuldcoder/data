-- a @entity2 woman tearfully recounted the death of her foster child at the hands of a schoolteacher during a congressional hearing tuesday looking into the use of seclusion and restraints in @entity12 schools			2
the @entity13 heard testimony tuesday on a report looking at school abuse			1
the hearing came on the heels of a report issued by the investigating arm of @entity21 that documents widespread abuse of techniques use to restrain or discipline special - education students			1
the @entity26 report was prepared for the @entity13 , which heard testimony from parents , investigators and experts who described traumatizing punishment of special - needs children			1
the violent acts -- from hours of isolation in locked rooms or closets to the use of handcuffs and pinning children on the floor -- often led to serious injuries and even death , witnesses said			2
committee chairman rep. @entity43 , @entity44 , called the testimony " startling			1
" " this is just unacceptable , " he said			2
" this punishment is way out of bounds of what i believe are the social norms of this society			2
" @entity52 of @entity53 , @entity2 , told committee members that her 14 - year - old foster child , @entity55 , died in march 2002 when his eighth - grade teacher 's disciplinary actions went too far			1
his death was one of the cases investigated by the @entity26 -- and the teacher , who is now working in a @entity63 high school , has been placed on leave as a result of the congressional investigation			1
@entity52 said @entity55 was experiencing behavioral problems in school and on that particular day he stopped working at 11 a.m. his teacher withheld his lunch			0
around 2:30 , still without having eaten , @entity55 tried to leave the classroom			0
her voice shaking and tears welling in her eyes , @entity52 said the teacher , whom she described as over 6 feet tall and weighing 230 pounds , forced the boy in a chair and restrained him			0
@entity52 said @entity55 , a small boy , struggled , so the teacher put him face down and sat on him			0
" i ca n't breathe , " he said			0
" if you can speak , you can breathe , " the teacher said , according to @entity52 's testimony			1
shortly after that , @entity55 stopped struggling , and then stopped moving altogether			0
the teacher continued to restrain him as an aide wiped drool off his face , @entity52 said			2
they then sat him up in the chair but @entity55 slumped over and slid off , @entity52 said			0
he was dead before @entity52 could get to the school			0
" if i treated @entity55 that way at home , i 'd be in jail , " @entity52 told lawmakers			0
@entity55 's death was ruled a homicide , @entity52 said , but the teacher never faced trial			0
she was placed on a @entity2 registry of individuals found to have abused children but , despite the listing , she now teaches at a public high school in @entity63 , @entity52 told the committee			0
tuesday morning , the @entity104 told the committee that the teacher involved in @entity52 's death had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation			0
the school system acted after the @entity26 referred its findings to the state school board , the organization reported			1
@entity52 questioned why the crimes of pedophiles are public but teachers who torture children are free to continue working without disclosure of their past actions			0
government auditors examined hundreds of allegations of abuse , the @entity26 report said			1
in 20 of those cases , it said , children died after being put in restraints			0
in four of those , the restraints were found to have resulted in the children suffocating			0
@entity26 investigator @entity131 told the @entity13 committee tuesday that he lacked data to quantify the problem , but in the 2008 school year , investigators discovered 33,000 instances of seclusion , restraints or other punishments in @entity2 and @entity44 alone			1
despite the problem , @entity131 said , no federal regulations exist on the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having " special needs , " conditions including autism and @entity147			2
at the state level , the laws are widely divergent -- 19 states have no laws at all			0
auditors found that eight states prohibit prone restraints or other techniques that hinder breathing , and 17 require teachers or staff to be trained in proper techniques before using them			1
only six keep records of how frequently those techniques are used , and reports are required by law in only two of those states -- @entity44 and @entity166			1
the @entity26 investigation found that teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods , and in some cases , where improper restraints led to injuries , teachers often kept their jobs			1
in 13 states , parents have to agree before teachers can restrain children in non-emergency situations , while 19 require teachers to notify parents after the fact			1
parents contacted by @entity0 commonly said they were not told their children were being disciplined until after they began to behave badly at home , which to them indicated trouble at school			2
when confronted with complaints , school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations , even after public investigations found the charges to be true , according to parents and the @entity26 report			1
@entity43 's committee is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special - needs students			1
@entity203 and @entity204 of the @entity205 contributed to this report			2

new @entity26 report shows abuse of techniques used to restrain special - ed kids
@entity213 hears testimony from parents , investigators
chairman @entity43 , @entity44 , called the testimony " startling "
