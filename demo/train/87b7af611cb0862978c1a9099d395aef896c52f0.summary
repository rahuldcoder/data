-- @entity2 coach @entity1 has hailed ending the @entity4 reign of @entity5 as the greatest moment of his controversial career , but said he could now never return to his former club			1
@entity1 has had a fractious relationship with the @entity11 champions since ending his four - year tenure on the coaching staff in 2000 , and stoked the tensions ahead of wednesday night 's second leg of the semifinal in the @entity18 capital			1
the @entity19 accused @entity5 of being obsessed with reaching the may 22 final because it will be held at the home of their bitter rivals @entity22 , and his joyous on - pitch celebrations at the @entity25 after @entity2 prevailed 3 - 2 on aggregate further incensed home fans			1
" i 'm not stupid enough to think that this hate can be turned into love , " he told reporters			0
" i respect @entity5 and and i 'll never forget what the club gave me in the four years i was here , but something has been created around me that is hard to make positive			2
" it is clear that i will end my career without having coached @entity5			0
" can @entity1 beat @entity38 to become king of @entity40 ? @entity1 has already won @entity40 's premier club competition with @entity42 in 2004 , and took @entity44 side @entity43 to two semifinals -- facing @entity5 on six occasions in often highly - charged encounters			1
but he said that leading @entity49 champions @entity2 to a first @entity4 final since 1972 -- with @entity52 giants @entity51 now in the way of the @entity55 's first title in 45 years -- was the best achievement of his career			1
" for the players , me , the fans , it 's the greatest			0
we were a team of heroes			0
we sweated blood , " @entity1 said after @entity2 lost 1 - 0 on the night , hanging on despite playing for an hour with only 10 men following the sending - off of former @entity5 midfielder @entity64			1
" it 's been 38 years since @entity2 played in the final			1
this is not a team of young players who can wait 15 years to make the final -- they will not have another 10 opportunities to play in one , " @entity1 added			2
" against @entity5 it 's difficult with 11 players , but with 10 it 's an historic achievement to win like this			1
it 's the most beautiful defeat of my life			1
" @entity1 is targeting a hat - trick of trophies this season , with @entity2 leading the @entity83 title race by one point with three matches to play and also having secure a place in the @entity88 final -- with @entity89 the chief rival in both competitions			1
" we have five games left in all competitions			0
tonight we will party , tomorrow we will sleep and after that prepare to face @entity96 on sunday , " he said			0
" i ask the fans for another favor -- come to @entity2 airport and welcome this splendid team home			0
come to @entity102 on sunday for the game with @entity96 and then come to the @entity88 final next wednesday			0
" @entity1 has had a difficult time with the @entity49 press since replacing @entity106 at the @entity107 in 2008 , but said he had a close bond with his club			1
" i was close to the fans when i was at @entity43 , but i am even closer to the @entity2 fans			0
i love @entity2 and the supporters , but not @entity49 football			2
i respect it , but i do n't love it , " he said			0
" i thank everyone who played and who did not play			0
i thank all the fans , those who were here and those who remained at home			0
" @entity5 will now turn their attention to retaining the @entity11 league title , as @entity125 's team lead @entity22 by a point with four matches to play			2
" we lost to a great team and a great coach , but we want to win the league and we will be back -- i have nothing to reproach my players for , " the coach said ahead of saturday 's trip to sixth - placed @entity134 .			2
