@entity0 -- a post- 9/11 law that sets federal standards for state driver 's licenses and identification cards is under fire from the head of the agency enforcing that law , the @entity11			1
homeland security chief @entity12 , here last week in @entity13 , @entity14 , wants to replace the @entity15			1
homeland security secretary @entity12 this week said she is working with governors to repeal the @entity15 , which was passed in 2005 and went into effect last year			1
the bill is popular in @entity0 , but is scorned by many governors who bear the responsibility and cost of validating that holders of driver 's licenses are citizens or legal residents of the @entity27			1
@entity28 , former governor of @entity29 , said she has met with governors of both parties recently " to look at a way to repeal @entity15			2
" she said she wants to substitute the federal law with " something else that pivots off of the driver 's license but accomplishes some of the same goals			1
and we hope to be able to announce something on that fairly soon			0
" @entity28 made her remarks tuesday in response to a question at a conference of the @entity46			0
on wednesday , rep. @entity47 , @entity48 , a sponsor of the law , said he was " angered " by @entity28 's comments			2
" @entity15 is a necessary program for keeping @entity27 safe			1
it is the will of @entity54 and also a recommendation of the @entity55 , " @entity47 said			0
" when the @entity57 took over the majority in the 110th @entity54 , they said they wanted to implement all of the @entity55 recommendations			0
i am highly disappointed that they are going back on their word by repealing this important recommendation , and substituting it with a weaker , less safe program that provides terrorists with too many avenues to attack			0
" while @entity28 is looking for ways to repeal @entity15 , her department 's web site continues to espouse the law 's merits			1
" raising the standards of state - issued identification is an important step toward enhancing national security , " the web site says			0
" because a driver 's license serves so many purposes [ access to federal buildings , nuclear power plants , boarding aircraft , etc. ] , terrorists actively seek fraudulent state - issued identification			0
the @entity15 rules will make it more difficult for them , while making it easier for law enforcement to detect falsified documents , " it says			2
the law , which requires all states to enforce specific identification requirements for driver 's licenses and identification cards , went into effect last year , but the federal government has given states until the end of this year to implement it			2
states can get extensions until may 2011 for implementation if they meet certain benchmarks .			0
