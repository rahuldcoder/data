-- if we allow this awful measure to stand , predicted the conservative spokesman , " behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country until one day ... we will wake to find that we have socialism [ and ] we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children 's children what it once was like in @entity16 when men were free			1
" this could be a tea party representative warning about the perils of @entity22 and willing to keep the government closed until it is delayed or repealed			1
but it was @entity26 speaking back in 1961			1
and the program he viewed as the driving wedge of socialism was @entity31			1
one can draw three important lessons from that statement and from the later presidential career of the man who made it			2
first , the fear that a federal program designed to help millions of people flagrantly violates the @entity41 and speeds the nation toward tyranny has deep roots in modern @entity16 history			0
in the mid- 1930s , the @entity46 hurled that charge at @entity48 for creating @entity49 as well as for endorsing the right of unions to organize			1
in 1964 , @entity52 made a similar argument against the @entity54			0
" the problem of race relations , " the @entity56 presidential nominee contended , should be left to the people of the @entity58 to decide			0
it " should not be effected by engines of national power			2
" in 1994 , @entity64 and his fellow @entity65 described president @entity67 's national health care plan , which included an employer mandate , as a radical attempt to coerce @entity16 business			0
the @entity46 collapsed after @entity48 won re-election in a landslide in 1936			0
but the careers of @entity26 , @entity52 and @entity74 were propelled by a large movement of white , middle - class @entity16 who shared the same dread of federal power @entity20 members now express			1
like the @entity84 brothers today , wealthy individuals on the right were always eager to finance that movement			2
the second lesson is that , over time , the dire predictions of conservatives have not come to pass			0
@entity49 and @entity31 did not destroy individual liberty in @entity16 ; they enabled millions of people to avoid poverty and an early death			1
of course , these programs eat up the lion 's share of the federal budget			2
but few citizens -- including the most zealous tea party activists -- would wish to cut the benefits they receive , much less abolish them			1
and if black people had waited for the majority white @entity58 to grant them equal rights , they might be waiting still			0
the final lesson is that when conservatives do take power in @entity105 , they depart quite markedly from the rhetoric of their campaigns			2
as president , @entity26 made no attempt to reduce @entity49 payments and expanded @entity31 to cover " catastrophic " costs			1
when he made it to the @entity113 , @entity114 , who had been the favorite candidate of most conservatives in the 2000 primaries , initiated a major new entitlement program , @entity119 when they campaign for votes and donations , conservative candidates for national office are fond of such slogans as " the bigger the government , the smaller the citizen			0
" but those who gain victory quickly realize that @entity16 like and often rely on the government programs , which benefit them and their families , and will punish any politician who tries to take them away			2
as two astute political scientists put it in the 1960s , most @entity16 may be " ideological conservatives , " but they are also " operational liberals			0
" ironically , however , the conservative activists who despise " big government " endure because the politicians they endorse never fulfill their desires			2
by losing nearly every big battle to curb federal power from the @entity144 onward , they maintain the fervor of a movement of outsiders			0
the struggle to preserve the constitutional order against the onslaughts of its enemies never ends			0
if a future president @entity155 or @entity156 did make a serious attempt to dismantle the welfare state , their disciples would lose their image as heroic losers			0
but this fall , the tea party , the latest version of the grassroots right , has already achieved a victory of sorts			1
with the acquiescence of @entity56 leaders , its stalwarts in @entity167 have done much to bring the nation to the brink of a financial catastrophe			0
if that debacle were to occur , we could , to paraphrase @entity26 , someday be telling our children and grandchildren what it was once like in @entity16 when we had a government that could truly function			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

@entity182 : in 1961 @entity26 warned of *spread* of socialism -- he was talking about @entity31
@entity182 : in *opposing* @entity22 , tea party echoes movements against @entity49
he says they *'re* usually backed by wealthy and predict catastrophe that never comes
@entity182 : activists draw power as outsider , but often find citizens like their social programs
