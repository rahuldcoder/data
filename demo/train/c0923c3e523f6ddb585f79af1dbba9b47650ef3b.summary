-- here we go again			2
this week , @entity4 - @entity3 negotiations will begin in @entity4 and the @entity5			1
having participated in my own fair share of these kinds of negotiations over the years , i would n't presume to discount secretary of state @entity11 's effort			2
but i also would n't get my hopes up			2
in 2001 , secretary of state @entity13 assigned me to assist gen. @entity14 , who had just been given a mission impossible : negotiate a cease - fire between @entity17 and @entity18 in the middle of the second intifada			1
i asked @entity14 straight out why he wanted to risk ruining a brilliant career on a goal he could n't possibly achieve			2
he replied that he loved hopeless causes			2
in that case , i told him , he 'd come to the right place			2
will these be the " @entity28 " negotiations and go where no man or woman has ever gone before ? it 's hard to say			0
but here are five signs that might offer clues as to whether there 's life ( or not ) on planet @entity39 - @entity4 negotiations			1
opinion : @entity42 , stay open to both sides in @entity45 talks 1			1
will the two sides maintain radio silence ? so far , @entity11 has done what no other @entity42 official has ever accomplished : he 's gotten the two sides who have a pathological history of leaking to essentially shut up			1
that 's either because there 's something meaningful to protect , or alternatively , there 's nothing really there there , and that 's worth hiding			0
i suspect it 's the former			0
so watch the leaks from both sides			0
if the substance of what 's being discussed is being backgrounded to embarrass , pressure or undermine the negotiators , the negotiations are in serious trouble			1
because this process depends on things @entity11 has heard from each side that they ca n't say publicly yet or wo n't say to one another , radio silence is critical -- for now			0
are folks writing things down ? the famous @entity78 mogul @entity77 was right : an oral agreement is n't worth the paper it 's written on			0
oral exchanges and verbal commitments can be starting points			0
but serious negotiation requires stuff on paper			0
more than this , every negotiation needs a way to organize the effort , and an agreement must be reduced to a text			0
ideally , the @entity42 would control that text -- as @entity94 did at @entity95 or as @entity96 did with the terms of reference and invitations to the @entity100			1
but the key question is whether the negotiators are working on language that will actually fill in the agreement			1
and what kind of agreement are they working toward : @entity108 / security first or an accord on the basic principles on all the issues ? if the parties are n't crystal clear on where they 're heading , then any road will get them there -- and that 's a recipe for drift and disaster			1
the same is true for showing maps			0
@entity108 of a @entity3 state are a key element in these negotiations			1
if you hear that one side or the other wo n't produce them , start looking for a new conflict to mediate			0
what 's happening away from the negotiating table ? there was a time that we believed we could insulate the talks at the table from the environment outside			2
that was called @entity138 , and the process failed			0
there must be some correlation			0
that 's why @entity11 has tried to get each side to stop doing negative things for a period of time -- six to nine months			0
@entity4 are supposed to do a phased release of @entity3 prisoners and limit settlement activity			1
@entity3 are supposed to stand down from efforts to bring the issue of statehood to the @entity153 or press their claims against @entity4 in international bodies , and stop incitement too			1
already , both sides are unhappy with nonobservance of these actions			0
a certain amount of dysfunctional behavior from both sides is built into the reality that one is the occupier and one the occupied			0
but given how little the @entity4 and @entity3 publics seem to have invested in these talks , everything possible must be done to demonstrate that life on the ground is changing too			1
and we 're not off to a good start			0
watch what the tough guys say @entity4 - @entity3 negotiations are as much about domestic politics as anything else			1
and watching those in each camp react to what 's going on in the negotiations is important			2
a certain amount of bluster from each side is expected			0
but one way to gauge the seriousness of what 's happening is to look at how worried the opponents of the peace process are			0
the @entity3 public is deeply skeptical of these talks			1
and @entity192 for sure will oppose them			0
so will members of @entity4 prime minister @entity196 's @entity195			1
more important will be the reaction of the two newbies in @entity4 in politics and in the coalition : @entity201 and @entity202			1
pay careful attention to @entity201 , whose right wing views count , and who will try mightily to make sure he knows what 's being offered at the table			0
if he 's relaxed and silent , you can bet the negotiations are remaining in pretty safe territory from @entity196 's perspective -- or he 's being frozen out			0
either way , watch out , signs of trouble may be brewing at home for the prime minister			2
what 's the @entity42 doing ? the odds against a conflict - ending accord that addresses all the issues are pretty long			1
it will require major moves from @entity224 head @entity223 and @entity196 and traveling to a place they 've never been before			0
but it will also require the @entity42 to be in the middle of the mix. right now , @entity11 describes the @entity42 role as a facilitator , a term that has very little meaning			1
( it 's the one we used to describe the @entity42 approach at the july 2000 @entity237 )			1
if this is going to work , both @entity11 , and at the right time , @entity239 , will have to be all over these talks like a cheap suit			2
and if the @entity42 wants an agreement -- assuming the two sides do -- they 'll have to push , shove and use ample amounts of vinegar and honey to get a deal , including developing formal proposals to bridge the gaps on tough issues such as @entity254			1
and those @entity42 positions need to be fair and reflect the needs of both sides			1
does the president want it that badly ? if he does , a high - level , pretty high - risk leaders ' summit is in his future			2
we may just have a chance this year to find out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity268 .			1

@entity4 - @entity3 talks are set to begin this week
@entity272 says there are signs to look for to see if the talks are going anywhere
he says watching if the parties keep talks confidential is key ; so is the @entity42 role
@entity268 : negotiators need to set out key principles , talk about borders
