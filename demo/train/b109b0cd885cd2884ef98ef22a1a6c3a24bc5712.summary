-- space , it has been said , is big			1
but big enough for two companies that want to mine near - @entity6 asteroids ? a venture announced tuesday in @entity8 hopes so			1
@entity9 says it wants to start sending miniature scout probes , dubbed " fireflies , " on one - way missions to near - @entity6 asteroids as soon as 2015			1
larger probes , " dragonflies , " that will bring back 50 - to 100 - pound samples from prospective targets could be on their way by 2016 , company ceo @entity13 told reporters			1
the goal is to extract metals , water and compounds that can be used to make spacecraft fuel from the chunks of rock that float within about 50 million kilometers ( 31 million miles ) of @entity6			0
@entity13 said the ability to produce fuel in space would be a boon for @entity34 , as the @entity36 space agency shifts its focus toward exploring deeper into the solar system			0
as much as 90 % of the weight of a prospective months - long @entity41 mission could be fuel -- and it costs between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 per pound to put anything into space			1
" if @entity34 can launch just the hardware and tank up in orbit , where the fuel is cheap , that means we could get to the @entity41 a lot sooner than we currently expect , " @entity13 said			0
that could also allow commercial satellite companies to extend the life of hardware that 's now written off when fuel for maneuvering thrusters runs out			2
" if you give it one more month of active work in orbit , it 's worth about $ 5 ( million ) to $ 8 million to the owner of that satellite , " @entity13 said			0
tuesday 's announcement comes nine months after the unveiling of a similar project by @entity66 , a company led by space tourism pioneers @entity68 and @entity69			1
that group , backed by investors such as filmmaker @entity72 and @entity74 executives @entity73 and @entity75 , says it hopes to get its first unmanned probes into space by the end of 2013			1
since the retirement of its space shuttles , @entity34 has hired out supply missions to the @entity82 to the private rocket company @entity83			2
it completed the first commercial flight in october and is vying for a contract for manned flights into orbit alongside @entity88 and @entity89			0
@entity9 said it can build its first class of probes largely with off - the - shelf parts and book them on other launch vehicles , such as the @entity97 - built @entity96 rockets or the @entity99 boosters developed by @entity83			1
executives said tuesday they 're also developing a foundry designed to produce metal parts from nickel , an element abundant in asteroids , and operate in space , and a class of " @entity109 " craft to extract valuable material from the asteroids			2
but @entity112 , the company 's chief technology officer , said its plans are based on existing technology , not " magic			1
" " you do n't see any space elevators			0
you do n't see antigravity			0
you do n't see warp drive , " said @entity112 , a former @entity34 scientist			0
" there is really nothing the business plan @entity9 is using that can not be done with the technological research that has already been accomplished in laboratories across the planet			2
" coronal mass ejection blasts @entity6 @entity34 landed a probe on the 20 - mile - long asteroid @entity132 in 2000 , while @entity134 's space agency not only landed its @entity136 spacecraft on the roughly 1,700 - foot asteroid @entity138 in 2007 but also returned it to @entity6 with small samples in 2010			2
@entity140 , project scientist for the @entity132 probe @entity141 , said the big question facing commercial space ventures remains what it will cost to get their equipment off @entity6			1
" the physics are feasible			0
the economics is a different story , " said @entity140 , who now leads space research at the @entity150 at @entity151			0
he said he 's hopeful that ventures such as @entity9 can succeed as more companies venture into space , however			1
" if someone identifies a way to do something out there that makes a lot of money , and there 's a lot of traffic and a bigger market , then the cost will come down , " he said			0
" it 's a bit of a chicken and egg problem			1
" space is a new legal frontier as well			0
the 1967 @entity173 provides for " free access to all areas of celestial bodies " by any nation , but is n't clear about commercial rights , said @entity179 , who researches space policy at @entity181			2
until that 's cleared up , that adds risk to any business venture , he said			0
cheap access to space has been " the sort - of @entity188 " for decades , " and we 're not much closer to that than we were 50 years ago , " said @entity179 , who is also an adviser to @entity66			2
but @entity9 chairman @entity191 , a longtime booster of private space efforts , said the company sees itself as the 21st - century version of the " settlers and shopkeepers " who followed the @entity199 into the @entity200			1
" one company may be a fluke			0
two companies showing up -- that 's the beginning of an industry , " @entity191 said			0
there 's room for everybody , " he added .			1

@entity9 is the second company to announce plans to mine asteroids
company hopes to launch its first probes by 2015
" @entity171 is big . there 's room for everybody , " chairman says
commercial space ventures face a " chicken - and - egg problem " with costs , however
