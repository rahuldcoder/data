-- the next time you step foot on a golf course , beware the legal minefield that can await you			1
if the game was not difficult enough already , it has a well - deserved reputation of being the most litigious of all sports , bar none			1
the cases that come to court cover the full spectrum of grievances and bizarre incidents , from the elderly @entity17 pensioner suing his former golf club for cutting -- yes cutting -- his handicap , to two - time major winner @entity20 going legal in a high - stakes wrangle over his multimillion - dollar deal with @entity23			1
from players tripping over rabbit holes , to a pair of @entity28 doctors involved in a landmark legal action after one of them was blinded by the other 's errant shot			1
it all backs up the main thrust of a publication from 2007 by @entity37 , a law professor at the @entity38 in @entity39			2
" @entity40 and the law seem to have been made for each other , " he wrote in " @entity44			2
" " on every fairway , in every stretch of rough , in every clubhouse , in every golf bag , at every swing at the ball , in every set of plans for a new course , in every application for club membership , there lurks a potential lawsuit			1
" @entity58 of @entity60 's @entity59 has made a 40 - year - plus career of handling such cases			1
he gives an example where neither the claimant nor the appellant were left with a good leg to stand on : " a lady and her husband were walking from the tee to her golf cart			1
in a freak accident she stood on a piece of unmade ground and contrived to rupture her @entity74 , " he told @entity0			2
" both her and husband were keen line dancers , could n't take part in the activity for months and brought a claim on that basis			2
the club had to settle			2
" golfing mousetraps it highlighted the fact that golf clubs have to think very carefully about every area of their activity because there are mousetraps everywhere , in the legal sense			1
most golf holes have yardage markers dotted on the fairway to let golfers know how far they are from the green , the most common at 150 yards out			1
but they had better make sure they are accurate			2
" a golfer hit the ball onto a green and hit a player who was waiting to putt , " recalls @entity58			2
" the golfer hitting the shot claimed the yardage markers put out by the course were inaccurate and he thought the green was further away and out of his reach			2
" the club had to settle the claim because they were liable			2
" and beware the hasty and ill - thought - out redesign of a golf course , says @entity58			1
" a club in @entity113 cut down trees on the left of a dogleg hole , which meant a lot of balls ended up in a big condominium			2
the owners were not happy and the club was held liable and had to settle			2
" serious injury while it is easy to poke fun at some of the claims , others are for serious injury sustained in the course of playing the sport			2
as @entity0 reported in 2010 , being hit by a poor shot while playing is a risk golfers assume and this was backed up by @entity28 's highest court in a key ruling			2
playing at a course in @entity138 , @entity136 hit a shot which struck his fellow doctor @entity140 in the left eye			0
@entity140 was blinded after the incident and launched a multimillion - dollar lawsuit against @entity136 for damages , alleging his friend was negligent for failing to warn of the shot			0
@entity136 testified he thought @entity140 was behind him and that he did n't see anyone between him and the hole when he took his shot			0
@entity136 unintentionally sliced it , striking @entity140 with terrible consequences			0
@entity58 says most claims of this nature are dismissed : " thank goodness the courts have an understanding that you ca n't hit the ball straight all the time , particularly the amateur golfer			0
" i think generally we get good decisions from judges because they understand golf is a sport and there is a certain amount of risk when you play			1
" but that did not stop 15 - year - old @entity170 of @entity171 , @entity172 from suing a local golf course for negligence after he hit himself in the eye with his own ball while on its driving range			1
according to court documents , @entity170 and his high school teammates were using the practice range			1
it was raining and the staff at @entity183 put up an awning			0
when @entity170 teed off , his ball hit a metal post that was holding up the awning just inches in front of his driving mat. the ball ricocheted off and hit him in the left eye			0
@entity170 's lawyer claimed @entity183 should have known that the metal pole was a danger			0
@entity183 did not respond to @entity0 's enquiries about the current status of the suit			0
costly repair during the economic downturn , even well - to - do golfers have felt the pinch , says @entity58 , but he warns against what one did to save a few dollars : repairing your own clubs			0
he cites the case of a player who took his tee shot -- then the head of the repaired club flew off and got stuck in his playing partner 's knee			0
painful for the claimant -- and costly for the do - it - yourself golfer , who was forced to settle the claim			0
it 's not a position in which former world no. 1 @entity20 should ever find himself , but he is embroiled in a very public legal dispute with his former management agency over its role in his contracts with @entity23 and other key sponsors			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity226 claims he was misled over the terms of the deals and is seeking compensation			0
the agent , @entity231 , and the management company @entity232 deny the claim and are counter suing in a case which is slated for the courts in october 2014			1
@entity20 , whose form has slumped since signing the big - money deals , admitted that it had taken a toll			1
" i 've seen more lawyers ' offices and more lawyers this year than i care to see in my entire life , " he told reporters at the @entity241 in @entity242 last month			0
@entity247 he also said he was taking advice from @entity23 stablemate @entity249 on how to deal with these pressures , although the world no. 1 himself is at the center of a controversy which threatens to end in a lawsuit			0
in a published article grading the tour performance of top players , former @entity259 pro and now analyst @entity260 flunked @entity249 , questioning his integrity and saying that he had been " a little cavalier with the rules			0
" as evidence , he cited three instances where @entity249 had been penalized for rules infractions and a fourth where an @entity268 analyst questioned the drop that @entity249 made after his ball landed in a water hazard			0
@entity273 ' agent @entity272 responded angrily over a " shameful , baseless " report and said he was considering a legal action for damages			1
@entity20 will doubtless take his own counsel but might look no further than the fate that befell a 75 - year - old amateur golfer from across the border in the @entity17			1
handicap blues @entity282 , a retired insurance official , was left with a massive legal bill in excess of $ 500,000 after launching an action against his former club because it had cut his handicap			1
this would normally be a cause for celebration , but @entity282 took it as a slight , particularly as a court in @entity293 heard he was accused of " handicap building " -- or allegedly playing below his ability to get his handicap raised and thereby be able to win more competitions			0
@entity282 sued the @entity297 and its former handicap secretary in the @entity299 for defamation , but a judge found against him last year and he has been left with heavy costs			0
golf for a long time was a male - dominated sport but as more women started taking part , clubs which restricted membership came under the legal spotlight for alleged discriminatory practices			1
federal law in the @entity313 now requires clubs open to the public to admit women , but @entity317 , home of the @entity313 masters tournament , was a private club and adopted a strict male - only membership policy for 80 years			0
that suddenly changed in august 2012 , when it announced it would admit its first two female members , former @entity313 secretary of state @entity324 and business leader @entity325			0
the volte face came without ever reaching a court of law , but rather thanks to the tireless efforts of women 's rights activist @entity331 and reported pressure from key sponsors			0
discrimination suits also extended to the top level of men 's professional golf when @entity338 , a former @entity339 teammate of @entity249 , took out a case against the @entity341			1
@entity338 suffers from a debilitating leg deformity that obstructs blood flow back to his heart			0
having qualified for the full @entity341 in 2000 , @entity338 wanted to use a golf cart in tournaments , but was refused permission by tour officials			1
@entity338 took a lawsuit on grounds of disability discrimination and finally won his battle in the @entity353			0
but he was unable to capitalize on his early promise and dropped off the tour , although he was a surprise qualifier for the @entity357			0
@entity359 challenge no article about lawsuits in golf would be complete without mention of @entity313 tycoon @entity359 and his battles to complete a $ 1 billion development in northern @entity366			1
he faced down opposition from locals and environmental groups , including a lawsuit from an 86 - year - old pensioner , to get permission to build his championship course on protected sand dunes in @entity376			0
but having built the course , now @entity359 himself has gone legal after the @entity366 government gave planning permission to a massive offshore wind farm just off the coast -- and within sight of his new resort			1
@entity359 has called the 11 turbine scheme a " useless and grotesque blot on our heritage " and has launched a lawsuit to attempt to stop it			1
the @entity366 government , led by first minister @entity392 , wants all the country 's electricity demands to be met from renewable sources by 2020 and is vigorously defending its decision in the court case , which started november 12 in @entity398 .			1

golf has a reputation for being one of the most litigious sports
cases range from the seemingly *absurd* to the serious
