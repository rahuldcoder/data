-- president @entity1 invited @entity3 gov. @entity2 to this year 's @entity5 address where he praised the @entity6 for aggressively carrying out the @entity7			1
" he is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth 's families , " @entity1 said about @entity2 , who boasts that more than 420,000 people have signed up for his state 's version of the controversial federal health law championed by @entity1			1
although he 's with the president on @entity7 , @entity2 has turned from @entity18 on same - sex marriage , saying he would appeal a federal court ruling overturning the @entity3 ban			1
@entity2 argues that traditional marriage leads to procreation and a stable economy , and he 's challenging the decision " so that the matter is fully before " the federal appeals court			2
his position swims against same - sex marriage tide			1
states continue to legalize it and courts continue to strike down bans where it is n't			0
it 's growing more likely that it will wind up before the @entity36 , as early as the next term			0
even @entity39 governors , including @entity41 's @entity40 and @entity43 's @entity42 , decided to not appeal court decisions striking down similar laws			0
@entity2 's short statement is a continuation of one he issued in march after his attorney general , fellow @entity6 @entity49 , decided not to push the issue			2
at the time he said he wanted to challenge same - sex proponents to ultimately settle the issue and prevent " legal chaos			1
" in @entity2 's effort through the courts to bring " certainty and finality " to the issue , he appears to oppose same - sex marriage by challenging the ruling as governor without having to take a personal stance			1
it 's a politically skillful move for a popular @entity18 governor in an increasingly @entity39 state			1
while @entity3 has a @entity18 governor , its two senators are senate republican leader @entity68 and potential 2016 @entity39 presidential candidate sen. @entity69			1
the state 's opinion of national @entity18 is low , as @entity1 received a paltry percentage of the vote - only 38 % - in 2012			1
@entity74 , a @entity75 political science professor , said @entity2 's decision is in accordance with the politics of the state			2
" he 's acting like a large chunk of the voters , " @entity74 said			0
the state is one of the last bastions of the dying breed of southern @entity18 who are socially conservative and fiscally more liberal			2
the most recent polling in @entity3 on the issue found that 55 % of people oppose same - sex marriage , a stark difference compared to the 38 % against it nationally			1
@entity93 , political editor at @entity95 's @entity94 in @entity96 , said the @entity97 is far more liberal than the @entity98			0
" the kryptonite for a moderate @entity6 with an increasingly liberal party in a conservative state is social issues , " @entity93 said			2
in an address to the state 's @entity104 during his re-election campaign in 2011 , @entity2 stood before the lawmakers , rose his voice , pointed his finger and told @entity1 to " get off our backs ! " when it comes to coal plant regulations			1
@entity93 said @entity2 's politics are masterful			2
" i do n't think there 's anyone else who has been able to yell at the president on tv and then go to @entity118 and be in the front row of the @entity5 and get praise from the president , " he said			0
" that shows the mastery of @entity2 to walk that line			0
" @entity2 is term - limited and will be out in less than two years			0
but political roots run deep and his legacy continues after 2015 as his son , @entity127 , has announced a run for statewide office			0
@entity127 hopes to succeed @entity49 , who is running for governor , as attorney general			0
the younger @entity2 is likely to be up against a a conservative @entity6 in the primary and even more conservative @entity39 in the general election			0
" he 's got to worry about the political viability of the @entity2 brand , " @entity74 said			0
same - sex marriage put on hold in @entity138 by federal appeals court @entity140 : @entity141 would support same - sex marriage			1

@entity3 governor will challenge decision to overturn state 's same - sex marriage ban
@entity2 said he wants to see " finality " on the issue
he is a @entity18 governor in a conservative state
his son is running for state - wide office
