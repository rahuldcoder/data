@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity3 arrives at work the first thing she does is to take off her clothes			1
for @entity3 is a professional nude model working at @entity0 's art academy			1
@entity3 : " you are trying to give inspiration to the students			2
" " it is a tough job ! " she tells me just before beginning to pose for a group of students , eager to paint her gracious figure			1
there is something striking about her bright green eyes and wavy red hair			0
" it does n't seem to be hard , but you know , try it ! put yourself in front of the mirror and then stay for a long time in a pose			2
you start : ' oh my back , oh something is strange here ... ' " she says , mimicking pain on her lower back			0
@entity3 is one of about 300 people in @entity1 who do this job , but only about 50 of them have full - time contracts			1
she makes the equivalent of about $ 1,500 each month , but only works three months per year			0
and that is why she and others recently went on strike , demanding a full - time wage for work they say not everyone can do			1
" it is not easy because you are naked , so you have to be very comfortable with your body and have a nice relationship with everybody , " she says as the students look on , " but not too open and not too close			0
you are trying to give inspiration to the students			0
if we lose these artistic roots that are very important to @entity1 then we lose a big part of our identity			1
" @entity62 is filled with naked men and women : think of @entity65 or @entity66			0
but back then artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models and muses , often with the complicity of priests who wanted the walls of their churches painted by famous names			1
" priests allowed prostitutes to use churches , " explains @entity76 , one of @entity0 's best known art historians			1
" officially it was to convert them , but the practical reason was to have the artist at the church			0
" @entity76 says that the @entity86 church , a stone 's throw from @entity89 , was a famous gathering point in @entity0 for @entity92 artists looking for " inspiration			1
" back then though professional modeling did not exist , and most would agree that the art did n't really suffer from its absence			2
so if @entity98 and @entity99 could do without professional models , what is the big deal now ? " it all started with the rise of art schools in the 19th and 20th centuries " says @entity3			1
" during the @entity107 you just thought that a prostitute can be a model or even a lover			1
but now we are here , so we need to move ahead			0
" art students hoping to become the next @entity113 agree			2
" i think a person should have talent , " argues @entity114 , a first year student from @entity115			0
" because you , for example , you could n't [ model ] ... i do n't know you , but @entity3 has talent			0
" @entity114 is right , i certainly could n't do it -- but unbeknownst to me she used me as a model while i was interviewing @entity3			0
thankfully i was fully dressed , so all she drew was my head			0
and she did n't to a bad job at that			2

@entity1 's art models have gone on strike , demanding they get a full - time wage
