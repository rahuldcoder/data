-- the @entity2 outbreak in @entity3 is a health crisis of massive proportions -- and one that keeps on growing			1
so far , the @entity7 estimates nearly 4,300 people have likely been infected in the latest outbreak , with almost 2,300 deaths			1
with no proven vaccine or treatment currently available , and a case fatality rate of up to 90 % , alarm bells are ringing across the globe			1
how worried should the @entity16 be ? and how can we help respond to this crisis ? it 's true that while @entity2 is deadly and this outbreak is historic , the risk of it spreading to the @entity16 is small			1
we have an advanced public health infrastructure that should be well placed to quickly screen for the virus and safely manage patients with @entity2			2
in addition , our health care providers have the training and equipment needed to control infections and protect themselves and others when caring for @entity2 patients			0
however , a small risk does not mean there is no risk at all			1
with this in mind , the single most important thing we can do to protect ourselves is stopping the @entity2 outbreak in @entity3 before it can spread to other parts of the world			1
in july , i visited the @entity43 , our nation 's health protection agency , and met with its director , @entity46 , to learn more about how the @entity43 is working with other @entity16 agencies , the @entity7 , and domestic and international partners to coordinate @entity2 assistance and disease control activities in @entity3			1
during that visit , we toured the @entity43 's command center for coordinating emergency responses to this outbreak			0
last week , i met with @entity46 again for an update , and to discuss his recent visit to the region			0
the @entity43 has deployed teams of public health experts to @entity3 to assist with disease surveillance , health education , contact tracing , and database management			2
on tuesday , i will participate in a @entity66 hearing on the response to this health crisis			1
one of the witnesses will be dr. @entity70 , an @entity16 missionary physician who was successfully treated for @entity2 in the @entity16			2
@entity70 was given an experimental treatment and a blood transfusion from an @entity2 survivor before being flown to @entity74 in @entity75			0
it seems like a promising breakthrough , and i look forward to learning more at the hearing			0
the seriousness of the current outbreak has been compounded by a number of factors that together have made this the worst outbreak of the disease in history			1
as the epidemic cripples already weak public health systems in the region , doctors on the ground are dealing with basic problems such as limited staff , little equipment , and poor facilities			1
this has made disease surveillance , isolation and effective care virtually impossible			0
additionally , high levels of public mistrust and fear about the disease and the response have resulted in @entity106 patients breaking out of hospitals and communities hiding infected individuals			1
cross-border travel between the three primary affected countries has also caused @entity2 to spread quickly			0
all of these factors have made this outbreak a particular challenge to contain , especially in remote , rural regions of @entity3			2
experimental treatments for individuals infected with @entity2 are currently being developed , but they have not yet been tested for effectiveness and safety in clinical trials			0
it would , of course , be advantageous to have a proven vaccine or drug therapy to tackle @entity2 , but in the meantime , basic care should be provided to significantly help those infected and prevent the spread of disease			0
such steps can include providing and reinforcing a trained medical workforce to coordinate activities on the ground in @entity3 , educating local communities about @entity2 and how it is transmitted , supplying basic medical equipment like masks and gloves , and assisting the governments in @entity3 to strengthen their public health systems and emergency response infrastructures			2
@entity2 can be stopped , but to do so requires both effective containment action and basic medical care			0
with the right international response and coordination , appropriate patient care can be provided efficiently and the spread of infection can be halted			0
@entity2 does not have to be a death sentence , but leadership and global cooperation are required to meet this serious challenge .			0
