-- no one in the @entity2 will be panicking just yet but this is n't how the @entity4 wanted to start their @entity6 qualifying campaign			2
the @entity2 -- fresh off an uplifting third - place finish at the @entity8 in @entity9 -- lost their first @entity11 or @entity8 qualifier since october 2011 after a slumping @entity13 overcame @entity15 's weakened side 2 - 1 in @entity12 thanks to an injury - time effort			1
it stemmed from a defensive blunder , as @entity20 's header intended for his keeper @entity21 went past @entity21 , hit the post and gave @entity23 an easy finish			0
@entity26 's @entity25 topped the @entity2 three years ago when the visitors had already locked up first place in their @entity30 qualifying group but the last time the @entity2 lost a meaningful qualifier came seven years ago against @entity32			1
it was n't the start @entity15 wanted in his second stint in charge as national team boss , especially after he saw his team fall 2 - 0 to @entity39 in a glamor friendly last week			1
@entity15 has been quizzed about formations since he took over from @entity42 , though the absence of winger @entity44 might be the biggest reason why the @entity2 only managed four shots on target against the @entity48 in @entity49			1
@entity44 sparkled in @entity9 , and the @entity2 ' mediocre display tuesday will strengthen claims that when he 's not in the lineup , it 's a different -- and less potent -- @entity2			2
@entity53 handed the @entity48 , who were winless in four games and lost 1 - 0 to the @entity56 at home last week , the lead in the 22nd minute with a fine effort off the post			1
@entity61 leveled in the 55th on a header and it appeared as if the teams would share the points			0
but in the first minute of injury time , @entity66 struck to deliver the @entity48 ' first win over the @entity2 since a 3 - 2 result -- that match was a classic -- at @entity72			1
fine start continues for @entity74 the last time @entity39 played a competitive international , it garnered even more attention than usual			1
not because of a win , but @entity80 's antics			0
@entity80 bit defender @entity81 -- an offense for which he later received a lengthy ban from @entity85 -- and to rub salt into the wounds his @entity88 bundled out @entity39 in the group stage in @entity9			0
it was the second straight time @entity39 fell at the first hurdle at a @entity8 and overshadowed the team 's surprising run to the final at @entity30			2
out went @entity96 as manager and in came the man who led @entity99 to three straight league titles , @entity74			1
@entity74 demands the best from his players , expects them to be disciplined and is very much into team spirit			0
he wants the players , too , to play with pride in an @entity39 shirt -- a shirt that he wore 20 times during his own career			0
his appointment was met with approval from the likes of @entity99 and @entity39 legend @entity113 , and the @entity39 duly upended the @entity4 in @entity114 , @entity39			2
in @entity74 's first competitive match as manager tuesday , @entity39 ended a 77 - year drought by topping @entity118 2 - 0 in @entity119 not since 1937 had @entity39 triumphed in @entity118			1
@entity74 did n't include striker @entity120 in the squad for the two games and he was without the injured @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity81 and @entity125			0
but the squad he assembled was plenty good enough to defeat the @entity118 , who last played in a major tournament at @entity127			2
@entity128 of modest @entity129 in @entity130 was the star man , opening the scoring in the 16th minute with a deflected effort from a tight angle , hitting the crossbar after a burst of pace in the 77th and seeing his chip cleared off the line moments later			0
@entity141 's free header in the 62nd minute accounted for the second goal			0
@entity143 created mild panic in and around the @entity39 box in the first half but was n't a factor in the second as @entity39 bossed proceedings .			0

the @entity2 lose their first qualifier in three years after a 2 - 1 defeat to the @entity48
the result came after the @entity2 lost to @entity39 2 - 0 in a high - *profile* friendly
@entity39 wins at @entity118 for the first time since 1937 , *cruising* in a 2 - 0 victory in @entity159
it was the first competitive game in charge for @entity74 , who left @entity99 in the *summer*
