@entity0 -- the early favorite to win the 2016 @entity4 presidential nomination walks a tightrope			1
@entity6 has said she is in no hurry to decide whether she 'll seek the @entity8			0
but the former secretary of state , first lady and senator stokes the assumption that she 's in the game for a second time with every move she makes			2
such status raises a question : how much time does someone in her position want to spend in the limelight at such an early stage and with no indication she will even run ? @entity24 jumps back into fray with speech on voting rights after years immersed in foreign affairs as @entity30 's top diplomat , @entity24 has begun to reemerge on the public stage			1
she is starting to carefully weigh in on domestic issues and devote more time to her family 's foundation , the @entity34			0
she jumped into highly charged political issues on race in a speech on monday in @entity39 -- sharply criticizing efforts to roll back the @entity41 as well the @entity43 - led drive in some states to require voter identification			1
" not every obstacle is related to race , but anyone who says that racial discrimination is no longer a problem in @entity30 elections must not be paying attention , " @entity24 said in her remarks to a group of fellow lawyers			1
" and despite the best efforts of many well - intentioned election officials , discrepancies and resources across precincts and polling stations still disproportionately affect @entity61 , @entity62 , and young voters			0
" @entity64 says he knows wife 's role with @entity24 in 2016 for @entity24 , her appearance before the @entity68 raised a few more eyebrows and is seen as a sign of things to come			1
â € ¢ she announced in monday 's remarks that she would deliver a string of policy speeches in the coming months , including one in september on national security			1
â € ¢ @entity24 is also writing a memoir due to be released in 2014			1
â € ¢ next month , @entity24 will host a fundraiser at her @entity0 home for @entity81 , a close family friend , mega-fundraiser , and the @entity4 nominee for governor in the presidential battleground of @entity86			2
all of this -- the political stances , the fundraising help and the glossy memoir -- has fueled speculation @entity24 is already running for president			1
she even has groups urging her to run -- like @entity95 that raised $ 1.25 million in the second quarter of 2013 -- as well as organizations that are questioning her credentials and laying the groundwork to oppose a run			0
@entity102 @entity4 raise money off @entity6 attacks " this keeps her out there			0
it keeps her prominent in the national debate , keeps her prominently talking about the issues that will matter in 2016 , " @entity1 chief national correspondent @entity108 said			1
" while publicly she tells her aides to say her inclination is not to run , she is preparing to run and she is doing everything she has to do to be ready to run			0
" @entity108 said that it appears @entity24 is trying to walk the line between being seen as resting on her front - runner status and enjoying the fact that she has the name recognition and prestige to wait longer than most anyone else			1
@entity24 , @entity124 hot , others not the fact that @entity24 is again making appearances has generated commentary over what kind of message she would want to articulate			2
" at the moment , her only one ( message ) is that she is a woman , " writes @entity132 in an opinion piece in tuesday 's @entity134			2
" becoming the first female president is a worthy goal , but it kind of falls into the category of miles traveled and countries visited			0
it is an achievement , even a stunning one , but it is not a stirring trumpet call			0
" @entity132 's piece has been roundly criticized -- largely because @entity24 has yet to launch any campaign			1
but the fact that he wrote the column speaks to the larger point : whatever @entity24 does in the near term will further fuel speculation about a candidacy			2
this is not lost on @entity43			0
by all indications , @entity24 is the most feared potential @entity4 presidential candidate			2
a number of groups , including the @entity159 , have begun raising money to derail any effort to run before it could get started			0
anti-hillary groups to beef up forces other possible @entity4 candidates -- namely vice president @entity165 -- have not received that kind of attention			0
@entity165 jokes about co-hosting with @entity6 " she knows exactly what she is doing , " @entity108 said			2
" it is a signal to all of those people who are urging her to run -- ' look , i ca n't give you that answer			0
you are going to wait a year or more for that , but i am going to be out there and i am going to be in the mix. do n't worry about it			0
' " @entity1 's @entity179 contributed to this report .			1

number of upcoming events -- a speech on national security , a diplomatic memoir -- raises 2016 speculation
on monday , @entity24 jumped into the highly political issue of voting rights and race
" she knows exactly what she is doing , " says @entity1 's chief national correspondent @entity108
columnists are already asking about @entity24 's message -- long before she even has formal campaign
