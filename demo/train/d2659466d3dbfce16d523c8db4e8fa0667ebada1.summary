-- the @entity1 is threatening to overshadow the @entity3 season for a third year running as the kingdom 's government and leading human rights organisations dispute the recent arrests of up to 70 people			1
in 2012 days of anti-government protests failed to halt the @entity1 which went ahead even as nearby streets were blocked with burning tires and trash			1
protests in @entity14 started in february 2011 spurred by uprisings in @entity16 and @entity17			1
but demonstrations in @entity14 failed to gain the traction of other @entity21 uprisings after a crackdown by authorities in the island state			1
the crackdown was backed by troops from nearby @entity27 and the @entity28 under the banner of the @entity30			0
the @entity31 told @entity32 that 20 people from the @entity35 and @entity36 villages -- both near the @entity37 -- had been arrested , with another 50 arrested from the @entity39 and @entity40 villages near to the airport			2
the @entity31 described the government arrests as " attacks carried out by the security authorities " , with @entity45 ( the @entity46 and @entity47 ) president @entity48 specifically linking them to the april 19 gp			1
" most of the detainees are activists in the fields of journalism documenting and photography , " said @entity48			0
" this latest crackdown and the way it 's being carried out raises new questions about the @entity14 authorities ' commitment to reform , " said @entity55 , @entity56 director at @entity57 ( @entity57 ) on the organisation 's website , which reported police have conducted up to 30 raids in on towns close to the @entity3 circuit and the roads leading to the capital , @entity67			2
" these raids and detentions suggest that officials are more concerned with getting activists out of circulation for the @entity3 race than with addressing the legitimate grievances that have led so many @entity14 to take to the streets			1
" however , the @entity14 government insisted the arrests were not linked to the gp			1
" the recent arrests came after a terrorist assault on the @entity85 building using @entity87 bombs , " the @entity14 communication minister and government spokeswoman @entity89 told @entity32			1
" their arrest came under the rule of law and they were sent to @entity95 office ahead of their trial			2
it has nothing to do with the @entity3 race			2
" it 's the state responsibility to protect its people along with those who are living in the county and impose security			2
also the security forces implement law when arresting someone and do n't raid houses unless it has an order from the court of public prosecutor			0
" the comments written by @entity57 are at best secondhand observations made without evidence			0
@entity57 is not on the ground in @entity14 to make such comments without verifying its source			2
" last year opposition calls for large protests had raised fears the @entity1 would have to be canceled for a second year in a row and pose a threat to @entity3 crews , workers , and fans			1
anti-government protesters had called the race a publicity stunt by the country 's rulers to make the nation appear more unified			0
@entity3 is the world 's most popular motor sport , and races have a tv audience of more than 500 million , though the scenes last year in @entity14 were viewed as a public relations disaster for both the sport and the country 's authorities			1
in 2011 the @entity1 was canceled completely after drivers including former @entity3 star @entity140 raised concerns following the death of at least 35 demonstrators as the government called in @entity27 - led forces to help stamp out unrest			1
canceling the race in 2011 cost @entity14 an estimated $ 480 to $ 800 million in potential investments			1
@entity14 's @entity150 - ruled government crushed the @entity152 protests , though the opposition has continued to demand political reform in protests and , occasionally , clashes with authorities			1
earlier this week @entity140 called on the @entity3 's ruling body the @entity157 and its president @entity158 to come up with a definitive position on this year 's race			2
" the vast majority of people in the sport would like to say we do n't want to come here to make life worse for people , " @entity140 , who now works as a motorsport television pundit , was quoted as telling a number of @entity164 newspapers after a security briefing in @entity166 in @entity167			0
" we would like you to enjoy @entity3			0
it has lots of positive things to offer			0
but please do n't , on our behalf , round people up and brutalize them			0
i do n't see that being political			0
it 's more ethical than political			0
" neither the @entity157 nor @entity158 were immediately available for comment			0
" the messages i 'm getting from various people in the opposition -- and there have been pretty regular street protest over the past three weeks -- is that the @entity3 race will be more of a focus than it was last year , " @entity164 mp @entity184 , who chairs parliamentary groups on motorsport and who was outspoken against last year 's race taking place , was quoted as telling the @entity191 newspaper : " that 's what they anticipate happening			1
if anything happens it will be a tragedy for all concerned			0
" i hope in the next few days that people will understand that words do have an impact			0
" @entity14 plays a key strategic role in the @entity56 and is home to the @entity211 's @entity210 headquarters			2
additional reporting by @entity213 and @entity214 .			0
