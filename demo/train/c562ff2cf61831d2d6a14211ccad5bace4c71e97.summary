the " jelly doughnut " rock that seemed to appear out of nowhere on @entity1 last month did not fall out of an extraterrestrial pastry box			1
the rock had been mysterious to scientists because @entity6 photographed it in a spot where the rock had not been present just four days earlier			1
@entity10 , lead scientist of the @entity11 , described it as a white rock with a dark red low spot in the middle			2
the rock , more than 1.5 inches wide , was named @entity17			2
so where did it come from , then ? drumroll please : researchers now say @entity17 is a piece of a larger rock , which @entity6 broke and moved with its wheel in early january			1
further images from the rover reveal the original rock that the rover 's wheel must have struck			1
" once we moved @entity6 a short distance , after inspecting @entity17 , we could see directly uphill an overturned rock that has the same unusual appearance , " said @entity29 of @entity30 in @entity31 , deputy principal directory of @entity6 , in a statement			1
" we drove over it			0
we can see the track			0
that 's where @entity17 came from			2
" no , that 's not as exciting as if the rock had crawled into view on its own or been dropped there by aliens			1
but now that this puzzle has been solved , the rover team plans to drive opportunity south and uphill to look at exposed rock layers on a slope			0
the rock has high levels of manganese and sulfur , which may have been concentrated in the rock because of water , researchers say			1
" this may have happened just beneath the surface relatively recently , " @entity29 said , " or it may have happened deeper below ground longer ago and then , by serendipity , erosion stripped away material above it and made it accessible to our wheels			0
" opportunity weighs 384 pounds and measures about 5 feet in both length and height			0
it recently celebrated 10 years since its january 25 , 2004 , landing			0
opportunity 's twin , spirit , landed on january 4 , 2004			0
@entity76 stopped communicating in 2010 , but @entity6 continues to reveal details about the @entity1 's former habitable conditions			1
@entity79 : 2 places on @entity1 could have been habitable opportunity is the older , less technologically advanced of the two @entity79 rovers currently exploring @entity1			0
the car - sized @entity83 , representing a $ 2.5 billion mission , is now on its way to @entity87 , a sedimentary formation that will allow the rover to explore @entity1 ' history by driving up the peak 's slope and exploring rock chemical composition layer by layer			2
@entity79 is planning to launch another curiosity - sized rover in 2020 , which could collect samples that later missions might return to @entity97 .			0

researchers : @entity6 's wheel broke off a piece of rock
that piece is the ' mystery rock ' that looks like a doughnut
the rock has high levels of manganese and sulfur
