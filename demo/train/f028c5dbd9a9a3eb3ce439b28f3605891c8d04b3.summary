@entity0 -- a high school sophomore in @entity0 who throws a mean fastball but was cut from his baseball team because he 's not so good at fielding bunts said tuesday that his rejection was off - base			1
" i went there and tried out and the coach gave me the excuse that i ca n't cover bunts , " 16 - year - old @entity8 told @entity17 's " @entity16 " about his coach 's decision at @entity11			1
" @entity18 was n't even part of the tryout			2
" and @entity8 's 80 - mph fastball just was n't enough , apparently			1
oh , there 's another thing about @entity8 that may -- or may not -- have anything to do with this story			1
life threw him a curve that other athletes at the school have not had to contend with : he has no legs			0
@entity8 launches his pitches from atop prostheses			1
but the birth defect never deterred him from pursuing the sport : he has played baseball since he was 8 , playing two seasons in the fall league and one on the junior varsity team			0
" they know what he 's got , " @entity8 's mother @entity40 said about the school 's coaches			1
" he 's a very good athlete , very good pitcher			0
he handles his own out there			0
" she said her son worked hard to hone his skills			0
" not to say other kids out there do n't work hard , but @entity8 has to work harder			1
he loves the game of baseball			0
" she added , " he became skilled at it , he excelled at it , and had to overcome obstacles , obviously , to get there			0
that 's the way i raised him			0
you do n't have a disability			0
you want to do something ? go out and try to do it			0
" in a written statement , a spokesman for the @entity68 said @entity8 was treated like any other player			1
" @entity8 was given the same opportunity as all other students to try out for the @entity11 baseball teams , " wrote @entity71			2
" he was among 63 student athletes who were evaluated for a position on either the varsity or junior varsity squads			0
with only 40 roster spots , @entity8 and 22 other students did not make either team			2
as a sophomore , @entity8 has the chance to vie for a position on a school team again next year and we hope he will			1
" but @entity8 said he was not sure he would , particularly if the coach who cut him keeps his job			1
" i would never play for him again , " @entity8 said			2
" he basically told me that i 'm not going to make the team ever again because i ca n't field the bunts , which is n't true			1
i can field bunts -- just a little slower than the average person			0
" @entity8 said his former teammates have been incredulous when they learned he has been cut			2
" their reaction is , ' oh , my @entity97 ! are you serious ? there 's no way ! how can you get cut ? ' they 're livid about it			2

16 - year - old @entity8 throws an 80 mph fastball
" the coach gave me the excuse that i ca n't cover bunts , " @entity8 says
" oh , my @entity97 ! are you serious ? "
