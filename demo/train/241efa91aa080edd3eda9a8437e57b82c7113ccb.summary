-- selecting a winner for the @entity2 is an invidious task because there are so many worthy recipients			0
there are individuals who put their lives on the line to help others and defuse conflicts as well as organizations which work on a daily basis , and invariably below the radar of media attention , to push a peace agenda			0
the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , which is this year 's recipient of the peace prize , is in the latter category			1
i am thrilled that @entity22 , the director - general of the @entity17 has been awarded the @entity23 on behalf of his organization			1
for years the @entity17 has been working to persuade governments to sign up to a treaty outlawing chemical weapons			1
known as the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , this treaty which established the @entity17 , is the fruit of millions of hours of diplomatic negotiations in the 1980s and early 1990s			1
building on earlier treaties , the @entity28 is one of the most comprehensive international agreements to control armaments			0
it requires signatories to agree that they will never manufacture or use chemical weapons , nor will they support others in this endeavor			1
@entity41 is the latest country , and the 190th , to sign up , somewhat unwillingly , to the treaty			2
most countries have acceded to the @entity28 willingly because they recognized the devastation which chemical weapons will cause			1
in @entity47 some 1.5 million were injured or killed by chemical weapons			1
more recently in the 1980s the @entity50 regime in @entity51 used chemical weapons , including mustard gas and various nerve agents , against @entity56 soldiers and @entity58 civilians -- tens of thousands were injured and killed in @entity51 and @entity56 as a result			1
some 30,000 @entity56 soldiers are still receiving treatment today for chemical weapons related injuries			1
but undoubtedly , the most shocking incident was the attack by the @entity51 on the @entity58 city of @entity68 where some 5,000 were killed and more than that number injured			0
families sheltering in cellars to get away from bombs where asphyxiated by nerve gases , chemicals which are heavier than air and which sink to fill any depression in the landscape			0
images on our television screens from @entity41 over the last few months are a reprise of what happened in @entity58			2
families in @entity85 , on the outskirts of @entity87 , and resident in areas controlled by forces opposed to the @entity41 government regime , were asleep in their beds when rockets filled with nerve agents fell through bedrooms or landed in the street			2
some rockets appear to have discharged their cargo before impact , others on hitting the ground			0
videos show glimpse into evidence for @entity41 intervention the result was predictable			2
thousands were affected , many dying without even waking , with others succumbing painfully over the hours that followed as they gasped for breath			0
how many died ? we do not know for certain			0
but numbers are being collated in @entity41 by doctors , activists and lawyers and the tally seems to be well over 1,000 now			2
many more were injured and some of these are highly likely to have long term effects , a situation which has to be investigated as a matter of urgency			0
we know all this from what doctors and others have told us and from the many images uploaded on @entity127			0
but we also know that it was the nerve gas sarin that caused all this trauma , just one of the many traumas @entity41 have faced over the nearly three years of the conflict			1
we know it was sarin because the @entity17 , on behalf of the secretary general of the @entity136 , sent in inspectors to take samples of soil , scrapings from used rockets , and blood samples from people			2
these samples were tested for the presence of chemical weapons in four of the 22 laboratories which have the necessary expertise and which are part of the @entity17 's network of competent organizations to help it enforce the @entity28			1
the laboratories confirmed that sarin had been used			0
the @entity17 now has the task of overseeing the destruction of the chemical weapons @entity41 has declared it has			1
the task is formidable because of the civil war in the country			0
@entity161 will also have to be found to pay for the work which is additional to the routine policing , fact checking and inspections which the @entity17 does on a daily basis to ensure old chemical weapons are destroyed , no more are produced and that the chemical industry continues to make ploughshares rather than weapons of war			1
the chemical industry , worldwide , supports this activity			0
so @entity22 in post as director - general of the @entity17 for over two years now , inherited an organization which had a solid reputation for excellent work over the years			1
but he has done more than simply acknowledge his inheritance and has , and is , steering his band of some 450 employees ( from many countries ) in a direction which will help guarantee that the attacks on @entity85 will become a thing of the past			0
we are all much safer because of the @entity17 which has done its painstaking work largely unnoticed by the world			1
no longer ! well done @entity17			2
your award is richly deserved			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

for years the @entity17 has been trying to persuade governments to outlaw chemical weapons , writes @entity195
@entity195 : most countries have acceded willingly because they recognize the devastation which chemical weapons will cause
the @entity17 now has the task of overseeing the destruction of @entity41 's chemical weapons
we are all much safer because of the @entity17 which has done its painstaking work largely unnoticed by the world , he says
