but @entity7 , which is owned by the @entity77 , worked with its sister station @entity79 in @entity80 to re-establish a signal			1
" our awesome engineers are fighting like hell to get us back on - air from off - site , " @entity7 investigative and general assignment reporter @entity85 wrote on @entity24 at 3 p.m. around the same time that local officials held a news conference to announce the suspect 's apprehension , @entity7 was able to stream its own live coverage to its website			1
during the 5 p.m. hour , that coverage also started to appear over the airwaves			0
it was raw at first -- just one live , handheld camera and one anchor , @entity99 , who interviewed his colleagues about what they 'd seen			0
" right now we are using our @entity80 station to bring you this signal , " @entity99 told viewers			2
" forgive us for the sloppiness			0
" after the police news conference , staffers were allowed to come back on the station 's property but could not enter the building			2
