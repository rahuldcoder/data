-- clouds of black smoke from burning plastic hang over the sites of @entity6 's vast dumps , as tiny figures pick their way through slicks of oily water , past cracked pc monitors and television screens			0
toxins from dumped electronics in developing countries has been seen as a growing problem			0
but it is n't just a cut from broken glass these mainly young scavengers are risking			0
much of the discarded electronic kit contains tiny -- but valuable -- quantities of aluminum , copper , cadmium and other minerals , all of which can be sold on , if they can be recovered			2
however they also contain highly toxic materials , which have been linked to reproductive problems and cancers			2
" people living and working on and around the dump sites , many of whom are children , are exposed to a cocktail of dangerous chemicals that can cause severe damage to health , including cancer , damage to the nervous system and to brain development in children , " @entity33 , @entity34 at @entity35 , told @entity0			1
" the open burning creates even more hazardous chemicals among which are cancerous dioxins			0
" no studies have been done on the extent of the chemical pollution of such sites in @entity6 , but in 2008 a @entity35 report on similar dumps in nearby @entity58 confirmed that high levels of lead , phthalates and dioxins were present in soils and the water of a nearby lagoon			1
a @entity66 academic report published in " @entity67 " in 2007 confirmed that children living in the same area had higher levels of toxic metals in their blood than other children living nearby			2
there is increasing evidence that this new health and environment problem is arriving in shipping containers from @entity80 countries			1
@entity6 is one of the principal global destinations for " e-waste " -- the catch - all term for discarded consumer electronics			2
some of this may have been legitimately handed in to be recycled in an @entity89 or @entity90 city , but lax enforcement , vague legislation and a lack of political will has meant that it instead passes through a network of traders keen to profit from developing countries ' hunger for hi - tech and a burgeoning second hand market			1
according to the @entity102 around 20 to 50 million tons of e-waste are generated worldwide each year			1
in 2008 a @entity35 study , " not in my backyard " , found that in @entity105 only 25 percent of the e-waste was recycled safely			1
in the @entity90 it is only 20 percent and in developing countries it is less than one percent			1
extrapolating out from these figures the report concluded that a massive 80 percent of e-waste generated worldwide is not properly recycled			1
some is burnt in @entity80 incinerators or buried in landfill sites			0
but much is exported to developing countries including @entity118 , @entity66 , @entity119 , @entity6 and @entity58			0
when it arrives , a further percentage may be repaired and sold on to populations desperate for affordable technology			0
but anything beyond the skills of local traders will end up dumped			0
it 's a profitable business , and is already attracting the attention of organized crime			1
a report issued by the @entity102 in july said that the criminal gangs behind much of the drug trade in @entity132 were becoming involved with e-waste trading			1
the volume of material on the move is staggering			0
in 2005 , more than 500 containers full of e-waste entered @entity6 ports every month , according to the @entity140 , a @entity90 ngo campaigning on issues surrounding toxic waste			2
each one contains 10 to 15 tons of e-waste , totaling 60,000 to 90,000 tons per year			2
these figures are likely to have increased in recent years			0
there seems little doubt that much of this waste is finding its way to @entity132 from @entity80 countries			0
the @entity140 and @entity151 have traced equipment from @entity105 to @entity6 dumps and earlier this year @entity35 placed a radio tracking device in a broken tv handed in for safe recycling in the @entity157 , but followed it to a @entity6 market			1
" @entity35 is disappointed especially by @entity90 and @entity89 authorities , " said @entity33			1
" it is toxic waste from the @entity90 and @entity89 countries that is causing serious environmental and health problems in @entity6 , a country without the means to deal with this problem			1
" the @entity90 and @entity89 must play the biggest role in stopping the spread of e-waste ; they are most responsible for the problem and have the resources to tackle it			2
the export of e-waste from the @entity89 is illegal under the @entity175 and the @entity176 , but the laws are not being sufficiently implemented			1
in the @entity90 , there is no such law banning this practice			0
" in @entity6 the government is talking about stopping imports , but there has been no progress on this to date			0
" signs of progress there are calls from environmental groups likes @entity35 for electronics producers to do more to phase out their use of hazardous substances , and there are some signs of progress			1
several electronics companies already make products using fewer hazardous substances , and others , including @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202 are setting up voluntary collection and recycling systems in countries where they are not legally obliged to			1
@entity207 claims its products are now almost entirely free of the worst toxic chemicals			2
" if producers continue to use hazardous chemicals in their electronics and to fail to take responsibility for the safe disposal of their products , e-waste will continue to be dumped in developing countries , " said @entity33			1
" the pollution and related health problems in countries where e-waste is dumped will increase massively as the amount of electronics used worldwide is growing exponentially and the number of countries used as dump sites will grow			1
" but while the developing world needs the @entity90 and @entity89 to take responsibility for their waste , it also needs their discarded computers to train and build a 21st century workforce			2
" nobody is arguing that @entity132 should be denied access to computers , " said @entity236 , founder and chief executive officer of @entity239 , a charity licensed by the @entity157 @entity240 , which provides recycled computers to developing countries to improve education and healthcare			2
" technical colleges and universities are always short of resources			0
it is , of course , essential to developing economies escaping poverty to have access to affordable modern technology			0
" computer aid works to close the digital divide between the north and southern hemispheres and offers corporations , including @entity261 , as well as individuals , a positive way of disposing of electronics			0
they also believe learning about responsibility for that technology is a crucial part of the exchange			0
" computer aid argues that , in addition to the pcs , it is essential to also build the skills , knowledge and operating capacity in every country to manage responsible re-use programs and environmentally sound end - of - life recycling			0
" in the end , this is about everyone involved -- particularly the developed nations -- taking responsibility for their waste			1
" it is clear that companies have a moral obligation to treat @entity132 in exactly the same way that they do , say , @entity291 , " said @entity236			0
until then , toxic black smoke will continue to cast a shadow over lives across the developing world .			0

export of electronic products for recycling creating health and environment problems
developed nations that export e-waste *criticized* by many for lack of responsibility
study from @entity35 *suggest* only around 20 percent recycled safely
