-- @entity2 's friends and family describe him as a teddy bear : charismatic , gentle and unassuming			1
the description is fitting -- the former @entity7 all - state offensive lineman weighed as much as a small bear in 2000 when his friends bought him a gym membership for his 25th birthday			1
not wanting to appear ungrateful , @entity12 went to the gym and a personal trainer promptly put him on a treadmill			2
@entity12 , now 38 , got to work , putting one foot in front of the other			2
but it was n't long before he looked down and saw smoke emerging from underneath the treadmill 's track			1
the trainer rushed in , quickly explaining that the treadmill was old , on its last leg and he would set @entity12 up on a better one			2
@entity12 obediently followed the trainer to another treadmill			2
the track moved and @entity12 walked			2
before another 10 minutes passed smoke again rose from underneath the belt			2
" after that i knew enough to stay off the treadmills , " he says			2
" that was another one of my excuses			2
" @entity12 would balloon to more than 500 pounds and be attacked by a life - threatening , flesh - eating bacteria before re-entering a gym with any serious intention to improve his health			1
but when he did , the stay - at - home dad would lose 300 pounds in less than three years			1
' he never stopped putting in the calories ' at 6 feet tall , @entity12 was always a big guy , says his best friend , @entity46 , owner of @entity47 and @entity48 , a @entity7 - based adventure race - event company			1
the men met when they were sophomores in high school at @entity52			2
" i played tailback and he was an offensive tackle , which made me automatically like him , " says @entity46			2
@entity12 weighed between 260 and 275 pounds when he played football and made all - state his junior and senior year			1
he played one year in junior college and then quit			2
" ( @entity61 ) was n't life for him , " says @entity46			0
" his personality was being a big , nice guy that everybody loves			0
" @entity12 moved to the family farm near @entity68 , @entity7 , where people began noticing his rapid weight gain			0
his younger brother @entity72 remembers visiting and seeing a mini-fridge in the living room next to @entity12 's chair			1
" i think he never stopped putting in the calories , even though he was no longer expending them , " he says			0
@entity12 was up to 350 pounds and taking classes at @entity79 in 1996 when he met his future wife , @entity80			1
" he was the cool guy that had the cool apartment that everybody hung out at , " she says			0
a year later , @entity12 asked @entity80 on a date			0
" i remember telling a friend , ' i do n't want anything serious because i 've got goals to accomplish , and he is not very healthy , ' " she says			0
but @entity12 won her over with his chivalry and charm			0
@entity80 remembers that they were only supposed to go miniature golfing on their first date but ended up going to dinner and a movie , too			0
" i remember thinking , ' oh , mercy			0
i 'm in deep , ' " she says			0
@entity12 's relationship with @entity80 did not change his eating habits			1
fast food continued to contribute to his weight gain			1
he 'd devour bacon double cheeseburgers from @entity105 , gobble chicken mcnuggets from @entity2 's and wolf down bean burritos from @entity108			1
when these off - the - chart sodium servings made him thirsty , he 'd wash them down with " the nectar of the @entity112 , " @entity113			1
nothing could keep him from frequenting these eateries , even hitting the big 5 - 0 - 0 on the scale			1
" that 's the thing about drive - through windows , " he says			1
" you can hide when you order five things , and they ask you if you 'd like two drinks with it			0
" @entity80 remembers going on vacation to the @entity124 near @entity125 , @entity126 , where she toured the mansion 's sprawling gardens by herself because @entity12 was too embarrassed to walk around			1
" i wanted to be so protective of him because people would just stare , " she says			0
" he saw the world from the seat in the car			0
" in november 2009 , @entity12 saw the world from a hospital bed when necrotizing fasciitis , a flesh - eating skin bacteria , assaulted the left side of his body			1
the infection was dangerously close to his heart , forcing doctors to remove softball - size chunks of infected tissue			1
@entity12 tried to laugh off what was happening but the situation scared him			0
he did n't want to die			0
the low - hanging fruit method a year later , @entity12 hit 530 pounds and realized he had to try to lose weight			1
" there is not an ' aha ' moment , " he says			0
" it was more like , ' ok , if i 'm going to try to do this , i 'm going to have to do it a little bit at a time			0
but i better do something before i lose my family to my untimely demise			1
' " @entity12 started " dabbling " at @entity46 's gym			1
next he gave up fast food and all - you - can - eat buffets			1
then stopped ordering soft drinks			0
finally , he started buying healthy food from the grocery store			1
@entity12 describes his strategy as the " low - hanging fruit " method			1
it allowed him to lose weight without having gastric bypass surgery , hiring a nutritionist or discovering a dieting secret folks in @entity179 would give their big toe to know about			1
" it was simple , but it was n't easy , " says @entity12 " i knew that i had to make a change because i was sick and tired of not being able to do anything i wanted to do			0
" @entity184 , a registered dietician and director of nutrition for @entity187 , says setting small , attainable goals like the ones @entity12 made is a better approach to weight loss than using an " all - or - nothing mentality " because people appreciate the progress that comes from each change			1
" if you do too much at once , it can be overwhelming and that makes you less likely to maintain it , " she says			0
@entity46 says he avoided @entity12 when he first started showing up at the gym , asking members to not say anything to his friend			0
" we 've hounded him so much over the years , " he says			0
" we were all just kind of holding our breath and hoping he would stick with it			0
" after @entity12 lost about 50 pounds , @entity46 approached him about entering an upcoming @entity48 race			1
together they made a video inviting people to sign up to run the approximately 3 - mile obstacle course , promising @entity12 was going to keep exercising and enter the event , too			1
true to his word , @entity12 competed in the @entity48 race at 350 pounds			1
" i just knew i wanted to complete it , " says @entity12 " i remember crossing the finish line and being ecstatic			0
" he has since entered and completed @entity217 and 10k runs , a half - marathon , a duathlon and a sprint triathlon			1
he will enter the @entity223 - mile bicycle race this august			1
at 230 pounds , @entity12 is now light enough to ride a motorcycle , an activity his weight kept him from for years			2
in november he will fulfill a lifelong dream by racing a motorcycle in the @entity229 in @entity230 , @entity231			0
" i had people in my life that i could go to and ask questions and i could use their knowledge , " he says			0
" i did not do this alone			0
" @entity12 still does weekly weigh - ins and says the battle to maintain his weight will last the rest of his life			2
he spends his free time with @entity80 and their two children , @entity243 , 3 and @entity244 , 5			0

" i think we 're stronger now than we 've ever been , " says @entity80 , who is writing a ph.d. dissertation about obesity 's impact on the learning process			2
" he 's my biggest cheerleader			2
" @entity12 also takes time to share his story with others struggling with obesity			0
he has a blog and occasionally speaks to kids at the @entity256 , encouraging them to begin healthy nutritional habits early			0
he recently took two 500 - pound men grocery shopping , invited them to his house to show them the types of foods he now eats and gave them some of his old regular and workout clothes			2
@entity46 says he believes @entity12 's story is better than a personal trainer for those trying to lose weight , because he has walked in their shoes			1
" he 's about the most inspirational person i know			2
" have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity272			0
