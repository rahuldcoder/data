@entity0 -- @entity0 restaurant owners were back to business as usual on tuesday , selling pitchers of soda and other super-sized drinks that would have been banned without a judge 's 11th - hour intervention			1
a citywide ban on the sale of sugary drinks in containers holding more than 16 ounces was set to go into effect tuesday before state @entity15 blocked the city 's restrictions on monday , calling them " arbitrary and capricious			2
" " it 's no harm , no foul for us , " said @entity19 , owner of brother @entity21 's bbq in @entity22			0
" we 'll go back to our old way of doing business			0
" in preparation for the expected ban on large sugary drinks at restaurants , fast - food eateries , movie theaters and stadiums in @entity0 , @entity19 purchased 1,000 16 - ounce cups to replace the 24 - ounce ones used to serve soda at his five restaurants			1
but after monday 's ruling , @entity19 says those 16 - ounce cups will remain in their boxes			0
" we 'll hold onto them for the time being , " he said			0
" we 're not going to use them			0
" @entity46 's ruling was in response to a lawsuit filed by a group of business associations -- including the @entity51 of @entity52 and the @entity53 , which hailed the decision as a " sigh of relief to @entity0 and thousands of small businesses in @entity0			1
" the city wasted no time in appealing @entity46 's decision			0
how @entity0 feel about big soda ban " we are moving forward immediately with our appeal , " said @entity61 , the city 's corporation counsel			1
" we believe the judge was wrong in rejecting this important public health initiative			2
we also feel he took an unduly narrow view of the @entity70 's powers			0
" mayor @entity71 touted the sugary drink ban as a step toward eradicating @entity0 's " obesity epidemic			1
" " we are confident that we will win [ the appeal ] , " @entity71 said at a press conference at @entity76 in @entity22 , where owner @entity77 has decided to comply with the city 's sugary drink restrictions despite the court 's decision			1
" it 's not about money at the end of the day , it 's about making a change , " said @entity77 ' son , @entity83 , adding that the restaurant has eliminated 24 - ounce to - go cups and 20 - ounce bottles of soda from its menu			0
other businesses were not as ready to comply with the restrictions in the wake of the court ruling			2
" we have maintained our position from the beginning that any regulations to eliminate @entity0 ' rights to purchase beverages in sizes of their choice is not in the public 's interest , " @entity97 said in a statement			1
" with the ban now declared invalid , customers in @entity0 will find all their favorite beverages in the sizes they want available at @entity97			1
" @entity112 , owner of @entity113 in @entity22 , had a so - called " plan b " for when he was no longer able to offer patrons pitchers of soda -- sell pitchers of juice instead			2
the high - end bowling alley 's chef developed recipes for cranberry - apple and mint , carrot and citrus juices , among other blends			0
@entity128 : health bans and ' sin taxes ' can easily backfire until the law dictates otherwise , though , frames will continue to offer pitchers of soda -- which come with a standard birthday party package			2
" as long as we can sell soda in larger quantities , we will , " said @entity131 marketing manager @entity136			2
@entity46 wrote that his decision was based on the fact that the ban was " laden with exceptions			1
" in addition , the law would have exempted a variety of retailers , including @entity147 , seller of the iconic " @entity149 " drinks , because it is regulated by the state , not the city			0
" the effect would be a person is unable to buy a drink larger than 16 ounces at one establishment but may be able to buy it at another establishment that may be located right next door , " @entity46 wrote			0
@entity71 said that the city 's legislation was aimed only at the businesses that the city has the right to regulate			1
" we just think the judge was totally wrong , " @entity71 said , adding that the city can only enact legislation " where we have the right to do it			1
" @entity1 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
