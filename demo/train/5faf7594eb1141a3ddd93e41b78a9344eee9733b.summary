-- twitter for ballooning into a global phenomenon that , finally , has a business model			2
in 2009 , @entity1 boasted some 20 million users			1
today ? more than 200 million			1
during that period of hockey stick - like growth , @entity1 unveiled a sleek redesigned interface , played an integral role in recent revolutions in the @entity11 , and introduced @entity12 , a stream of tweet - size ads that reportedly cost major companies at least $ 100,000 to purchase			1
@entity16 for launching the most radical upgrade to search in years with @entity19 -- and still boasting a 98 percent adoption rate			2
with some 2 million searches per second and 3 billion per day , @entity16 ca n't alter a pixel in its logo without the world knowing			1
yet that did n't stop the internet giant from unveiling @entity19 , a results - as - you - type search engine that has helped users save an average of 4 to 5 seconds on each query			2
@entity33 for turning what most social media companies ca n't : a ( $ 400 million ) profit			2
in january , social gaming company @entity33 introduced @entity37 , the follow - up to their blockbuster ( not to mention addictive ) @entity40 game			0
a little over a month later , @entity37 already boasted more than 100 million users , making it the most popular app on @entity43			1

@entity46 for boldly cannibalizing its own dvd - by - mail business			1
to defend against growing competition from @entity50 and @entity51 ( @entity52 , who ? ) , @entity46 launched streaming - only services in the @entity55 and @entity56 -- both of which became instant hits			1
so in recent earnings reports , @entity46 ceo @entity60 has n't highlighted the company 's monstrous $ 2.2 billion 2010 revenues ( up 29 percent year - over - year ) , or the huge uptick in members to some 20 million subscribers ( more than @entity67 and @entity68 )			1
rather , he brought out the most astounding figure of all : nearly 70 percent of subscribers now stream content online , up from 41 percent last year			0
foursquare for fending off copycats , goosing growth , and making check - ins a must - use marketing tool for major brands			0
astronaut @entity78 earned the @entity79 when he checked in while orbiting the @entity80 -- a story that reflect @entity72 's meteoric rise			0
the company now boasts 7.5 million users , well more than double its total in september 2010			1
most significantly , the company has steamed ahead in the face of growing competition -- from @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , and especially @entity92			0

@entity99 for turning stray thoughts into big business			0
the @entity102 - based @entity1 - that 's - not - limited - to - 140 - characters micro-blogging service is drawing around 30,000 new members each day -- and more impressively , around 4 billion page views per month			1
in november , it scored between $ 25 million and $ 30 million from investors , bringing its total past $ 40 million			0
@entity107 for developing a revolutionary way to monitor and measure @entity1 chatter			2
@entity107 began at @entity111 's @entity110 but has flourished into the prime analytics tool for @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity115 , which use the tech to gauge public perception			0
the company uses a " statistical human - assisted approach " to monitor the @entity119 , tracking and learning the specifics of what people are saying in social media in real - time -- beyond the positive - or - negative analysis of keyword and semantic searches -- and with as much as 97 percent accuracy			0
@entity131 for creating the @entity132 of the digital age			0
on this site , live streams are pulled from @entity43 and @entity1 ; recently acquired service @entity136 culls the best financial news stories from the @entity138 ; weekly webinars and video market recaps are offered ; and @entity141 features original programming around the clock			1

@entity114 for reinvigorating search market competition with @entity150 , the only formidable @entity16 challenger left			1
thanks to strategic partnerships with @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity1 , and @entity43 , @entity150 has begun nipping away at @entity16 's market share -- and kept its @entity157 - based foe from becoming a monopoly			1
earlier this month , @entity150 became the second most - popular search engine worldwide			1
@entity160 for harnessing the power of social media to keep @entity163 relevant long after he was yanked off the air			0
even after his unfortunate departure from @entity168 , @entity169 kept his brand red - hot ( er , orange - hot ? ) thanks to a squad of 8 full - time @entity174 staffers running his social media like pros			0
cases in point : the millions of views on @entity183 , hundreds of thousands of fans on @entity43 , and millions of followers on @entity1			2
to hype his @entity187 show 's november debut , @entity163 's team also started a 24 - hour live webcast of the production , built fan pages on @entity192 and @entity99 -- and launched a bright orange @entity163 blimp , which spotters could check into on @entity72			2
