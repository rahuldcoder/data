-- comedy is n't evolutionary			2
@entity2 has been plundering ancient history for yuks at least since @entity5 's day , and there 's little in " @entity7 " to suggest we 've progressed much over the last 90 years			1
@entity9 and @entity10 go in search of meaning -- and some food -- in " @entity7			1
" quite the opposite , in fact			0
it 's a stretch to envisage @entity5 picking up bear poop , as @entity10 does here , giving it an appraising sniff , then a quick lick			1
and i ca n't imagine him peeing down his own nostrils , as @entity9 does ( he 's chained upside down at the time )			1
not to say this monkey business is n't funny ; these are the highlights of a relentlessly low - brow lark , notwithstanding several sophomoric speeches in a panicky existentialist vein			0
@entity10 is @entity29 , a sorry excuse for a hunter in a tribe that has yet to discover the wheel			2
his buddy @entity34 ( @entity9 ) is even further down the totem pole , a mere gatherer			2
neither is a hit with the ladies , and when @entity29 is exiled after stealing forbidden fruit , well , not even @entity34 wants to go with him -- though of course he does tag along			0
it 's no fun being a sidekick all on your lonesome			0
co-written and directed by comedy veteran @entity47 ( " @entity48 , " " @entity49 " ) , " @entity7 " is little more than a series of juvenile skits dressed up in toga party glad rags			1
it rambles off into @entity56 territory when the boys stumble across @entity58 ( @entity59 ) killing his brother @entity60 ( @entity60 ) , then arrive in the desert in the nick of time to save @entity65 's neck ( @entity66 ) from his zealous father 's knife -- though his foreskin is another story			0
sorely lacking the anarchic edge that @entity72 brought to " @entity73 " and the sheer chutzpah of @entity76 ' " @entity75 : part one , " " @entity7 " is more akin to one of those old @entity80 - @entity79 jaunts -- two guys bicker and banter in exotic climes , hopping from scrape to scrape without ever reaching the bottom of the barrel			1
inevitably , @entity29 and @entity34 find themselves on the road to @entity89 , where @entity91 's plummy high priest orchestrates orgies in the afternoon then presides over human sacrifices in the evening			0
it is in @entity89 that the boys will prove their manhood			0
@entity10 's manic over-reacher and @entity9 's shy mumbler complement each other well enough in theory , but at 39 , @entity10 is almost old enough to be the 21 - year - old @entity9 's father			1
it 's a big age gap for a comedy duo , and they never quite mesh or convince as bosom buddies , even if they 're fairly amusing separately			2
among the supporting cast , only @entity107 's fundamentalist @entity106 really seizes on the possibilities ; he and @entity91 deliver the goods			0
too many others , on the other hand , just seem to have dropped by to hang out for a day or two on set			0
typically , neither @entity114 nor @entity115 gets any breathing room as the heroes ' designated distressed damsels ; @entity47 ogles female flesh as enthusiastically as he milks homophobia for cheap laughs			1
bearing the tell - tale scars of slash - and - burn post-market testing editing -- several early scenes simply hit a brick wall -- " @entity7 " is n't an out - and - out disaster			1
it 's just another feeble comedy that never finds its rhythm or builds up a head of steam			1
ireport.com : share your review of " @entity7 " it was probably a lot more fun to make than it is to watch , but we 'll have to take that on trust			2
even the outtakes played alongside the end credits are n't funny			0
" @entity7 " is rated @entity141 and runs 100 minutes			2

" @entity7 " is a feeble comedy , says @entity0 's @entity147
@entity47 - directed film stars @entity10 and @entity9 , but few laughs
@entity10 and @entity9 play @entity153 *tribesmen* who meet *biblical* figures
