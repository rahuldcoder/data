-- it may lack the grace of an airship , or the class of @entity5 , but the " @entity7 " has a style all of its own			1
this somewhat awkward looking vehicle is the work of @entity12 company e-volo and a prototype has just made its first manned flight , after completing unmanned trials			1
with e-volo 's @entity17 strapped into the center of its four - limbed frame , it flew for one minute and 30 seconds over a field in @entity23 , powered by 16 small rotor blades			1
@entity7 says its creation is powered entirely by lithium batteries and can carry a load of around 80kg -- about as much as it weighs			1
watch " @entity7 's " first manned flight			1
while the maiden flight may not have lasted long or covered much distance , it was enough to convince its designers that it has the potential to develop further			2
" it could go longer , " said e-volo 's @entity36			2
" but for safety we decided before the take off to fly one minutes 30 seconds			0
" " this was a proof of concept , not really safe to fly , " he added			0
" we work on a prototype that we will fly in summer 2012 very safely			0
" the pilot steers the @entity7 using a joystick and , despite looking as though it might be grounded by a strong gust of wind , it is very easy to control , according to @entity36			2
although there 's plenty of development work left to do , e-volo believes the vehicle could one day be have a variety of uses , including an air taxi			1
and they say its ability to hover in one place means it has the potential to be used for search and rescue missions			0
" there are many possible applications , " said @entity36			0
" we see it becoming a widespread form of personal transport			0
