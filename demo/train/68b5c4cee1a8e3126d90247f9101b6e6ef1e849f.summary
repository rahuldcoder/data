@entity0 -- registered child sex offenders in @entity4 , @entity5 , will not have to post a sign outside their home this @entity9 reading in part " no candy , " but they still are prohibited from decorating their houses and handing out candy , a federal judge ruled tuesday			1
this is a partial and temporary victory for a group of the city 's sex offenders and their wives who sued the city claiming that a recently passed law was unconstitutional and sought a temporary injunction of the law before a full hearing next month			1
the @entity4 law placed the following @entity9 restrictions on child sex offenders within the city who appear on a statewide database : -- post a sign stating " no candy or treats at this residence " -- leave all outdoor lighting off during the evening -- no exterior @entity9 decorations and refrain from answering the door for trick - or - treaters			1
@entity40 district judge @entity39 ruled that all but the sign provision could still be enforced			1
" plaintiffs have , however , made a clear showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their facial challenge to the sign posting requirement of the @entity49 and that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a temporary restraining order , " @entity39 wrote			2
attorney told @entity1 before the ruling that she believed the signs would attract more attention to her clients ' homes and could incite vandalism or violence			0
" we are pleased with the judge 's decision , " said @entity60 , who is representing the 10 plaintiffs , in a statement to @entity1			2
" this requirement , if enforced , would have branded registrants and placed them as well as member of their families at significant risk of harm			0
" " i make no apologies for introducing this to our @entity74 , " @entity4 mayor @entity71 told @entity1 earlier this month			0
" the number one goal and priority of government is to protect its citizens , particularly its most vulnerable -- the innocent children			0
