-- most @entity1 think of the @entity2 as an icy , distant place ; beautiful , remote and teeming with wildlife , but unrelated to their daily lives			1
nothing could be further from the truth			0
this summer , big doings on @entity1 's northern doorstep will have enormous consequences to the economic , strategic and environmental future of the nation			1
yet we are unprepared for the challenges and opportunities			0
what happens in the @entity2 as ice melts there could soon cheapen the cost of the gas you buy and products you purchase from @entity24			1
it could help make the nation more energy independent			0
it could draw our leaders into a conflict over undersea territory			0
it is already challenging @entity33 to protect millions of square miles filled with some of the most magnificent wildlife on @entity36 , and native people whose culture and way of life is at risk as a squall line of development sweeps across the once inaccessible top of the planet			2
opinion : it 's time to develop our @entity2 resources for @entity1 , the stakes are huge : a chance to gain wealth and global influence in the newest geopolitical playing field , but there is also potential environmental and security disaster if looming challenges are mishandled or ignored			1
if that sounds farfetched , consider the following : -- @entity59 is poised to sink exploratory wells -- temporary ones drilled from ships -- 70 miles north of @entity63 in a few weeks			1
the operation will assess whether an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil is there			1
this is roughly three times the amount that has been extracted from the @entity70 over the past 20 years			0
@entity59 ship slips anchor ; incident raises questions about @entity2 drilling plan proponents believe a discovery would cut @entity1 's dependence on foreign oil and provide jobs and needed revenue to the @entity82			1
they say the oil could be extracted safely			0
opponents fear a spill would be a disaster , being difficult to clean up in icy seas			0
more oil companies wait in the wings and also own offshore leases			0
-- in @entity33 , politicians are jockeying over whether to ratify " @entity92 , " under which countries abutting oceans will be able to claim up to 200 extra miles of undersea territory if they can prove it an extension of their continental shelves			0
for the @entity1 , that could mean extra territory the size of @entity104 off @entity63			1
president @entity105 and former president @entity106 support the treaty , as does an oddly aligned group including the @entity109 , @entity110 , oil companies , shipping companies and environmentalists , who favor the part of the treaty designed to help protect the world 's oceans			1
although every other @entity2 country has ratified the treaty , in the @entity1 it has been blocked for years by conservative senators who fear that it gives too much influence to multinational bodies			1
-- an undersea land rush has started under the treaty , with @entity127 claiming an area the size of @entity130 and @entity131 combined			0
@entity133 's claim has been granted , and other @entity2 nations preparing to file claims			1
one @entity137 admiral , speaking of the treaty , told me , " if this was a ball game , the @entity1 would n't be on the field , in the stadium or even in the parking lot			2
we 're last in this race			0
" -- the @entity127 military has identified the @entity2 as one of the likely places for conflict to erupt in the 21st century over resources			2
even if actual combat never occurs , whoever controls the high north will wield enormous influence in the coming decades			0
@entity127 has 18 working icebreakers			0
@entity127 is opening their @entity2 sea lanes to commercial shipping			1
the @entity1 has no permanent @entity137 or @entity161 presence yet in the high north , although both branches of the service are preparing to move north			1
@entity161 war games last fall anticipated security challenges in the near future : how to deal with terrorists in the @entity2 , how to deal with a rogue ship carrying nuclear weapons in the @entity2 , how to move a @entity1 fleet around the top of the planet , how to help clean up an oil spill			1
gamers concluded the @entity176 needs to prepare and needs more resources			0
-- the @entity178 is the long - dreamed - of , formerly iced - over sea route between @entity180 and @entity24			2
this route around the top of @entity183 and @entity63 has killed hundreds of sailors and explorers for centuries , locking their ships in ice , starving them , freezing them , driving them insane and causing survivors to eat each other			2
yet in summers , that passage is now so clear that tourist ships routinely sail through it			0
even private yachts make the trip			0
it is expected that commercial shipping will follow			0
that 's because a single @entity201 container ship sailing the @entity178 between @entity202 and @entity203 instead of using the @entity204 would save an estimated $ 2 million each way on gas and tolls			0
in short , the region is opening			2
for the past three years , i 've spent much time in northern @entity63 researching for my book , " the @entity212 and the @entity213			2
" it 's about the grand challenges facing the world there , as seen through the eyes of an @entity220 leader who is a grandfather and whale hunter , and the @entity59 executive sent to drill for oil off @entity63 's @entity224			1
i sailed on the only @entity1 icebreaker for six weeks , sat in on meetings at the @entity227 over the @entity2 , attended a naval war game and met regularly with other oil executives and @entity220 leaders , whale hunters and families on the @entity224			1
that 4,000 - year - old culture sits at the border between wise development and environmental anarchy , and the people of @entity1 's polar county will soon watch with hope and fear as the oil ships move north			1
their concerns are not just local ones but should engage every @entity1			2
if you care about the environment , if you care about gas prices , if you care about where our soldiers and navy may serve next , if you want the @entity1 to remain strong and dominant in the world , look to the north this summer			1
that 's where much of our common future is about to play out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity257 .			2

@entity59 is planning to drill 70 miles north of @entity63 to see whether 27 billion barrels of oil are there
@entity257 : for @entity1 , the stakes are huge in the @entity2
he says opening of the region could cheapen price of gas and products from @entity24
@entity257 : if you want the @entity1 to remain strong and dominant in the world , look to the north
