-- researchers have discovered a previously unknown group of rare monkeys in the forests of @entity5			2
the @entity8 snub - nosed monkeys were so skittish , researchers captured a photo of only one : an adult male			1
several biologists caught fleeting glimpses of about 15 or 20 @entity8 snub - nosed monkeys in a remote area near the @entity17 frontier , the wildlife conservation group @entity11 said thursday			1
the " bizarre - looking " monkeys -- on the brink of extinction -- were so skittish around people that researchers were able to snap a photo of just one of them : an adult male scampering through the trees			0
the monkeys were " very sensitive to the presence of people , giving warning signs to one another and fleeing " whenever biologists approached , the group said in a statement			0
" it was apparent that the monkeys associated humans with danger -- perhaps due to ongoing threats from hunters , " the group said			0
so few @entity8 snub - nosed monkeys have survived in the wild that scientists thought until recently that they were extinct			1
now they estimate that roughly 200 remain , mainly in parts of northern @entity5 near the @entity17 border			0
hunters with a taste for bush meat and the loss of habitat have pushed the @entity8 snub - nosed monkey toward extinction , according to the @entity54			1
it classifies the primate as critically endangered " because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals , with no subpopulation greater than 50 mature individuals , and it is experiencing a continuing decline			2
" fauna & @entity65 said it is working with a variety of groups to improve the livelihoods and " reduce human pressures on the forest ecosystem " in an effort to safeguard the newly discovered group , which was spotted in a patch of forest in the @entity77 district of @entity5 's @entity79 province			0
the sighting thrilled conservation biologist @entity81 , described by @entity11 as " one of the few people in the world who can claim to be an expert on this mysterious species " and as the person credited with discovering the new group of that species			2
" when i saw the @entity8 snub - nosed monkeys ... i was overjoyed , " he said in the @entity11 statement			1
" there is still time to save this unique species , but with just 200 or so left and threats still strong , we need to act now			0
