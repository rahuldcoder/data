-- months after sexting revelations dashed @entity3 's hopes of election in @entity5 , a mayor on the other side of the world is battling for political survival following a lurid sex scandal that has electrified the usually sleepy world of local politics			1
the crisis engulfing @entity14 , the recently re-elected mayor of @entity15 , @entity16 's largest city , involves sex in the mayoral chambers , a former mistress who says she also shared a bed with an adviser to his rival , intrigue as to whether the mayor was victim of a political smear campaign , and a hunt for the sender of a mystery text message that triggered the revelations			1
the scandal , broken by a blogger and virtually unprecedented in @entity16 politics in its sleaziness , has raised fears it could herald a grubby new era in which the sex lives of politicians , traditionally seen as beyond the purview of the media , become fair game			1
" in the past , it was the case that sexuality and what politicians did in their own private lives was deemed to be non-political , and not generally reported upon , " said @entity42 , political scientist at the @entity43			0
" that has definitely changed			0
i think this story will shift the goalposts more than any other to give the green light to political insiders to think you can air the dirty laundry of politicians			0
" the scandal has left @entity14 , a 57 - year - old married father - of - three , publicly humiliated , facing a council inquiry as to whether he breached codes of conduct , and weathering mounting calls for him to resign the mayoralty to which he was re-elected only days before the scandal broke			1
for her part , the former mistress who exposed his infidelity -- @entity71 , who sat on a council advisory panel and was an unsuccessful local board candidate at the recent elections -- says she now regrets her actions in outing the center - left mayor , and has turned on those she claims pressured her into doing so			1
neither @entity14 and @entity71 responded to repeated requests from @entity0 for comment			1
however , in a post on her @entity84 page , the 32 year old fired shots at the blogger who published her account , and at @entity88 , an adviser to @entity14 's main rival for the mayoralty , with whom she says she also had an intimate relationship			1
" i have been foolish , but i feel used , abused and manipulated by people i thought were friends who have been taking snippets of what i have said to advance their own political agendas and muck - raking , " she wrote			1
while the @entity84 post has been taken down , @entity71 expressed similar sentiments in an interview she gave to the @entity104 newspaper			0
@entity106 , for his part , has denied that he was romantically involved with @entity71			0
" nobody 's come out of this with any credit , " said @entity107 , an @entity15 city councilor who is a long - time rival of @entity14 's			1
" but the person who has come out with the least is the mayor			2
" the scandal broke tuesday when right - leaning political blog @entity113 , run by @entity115 , published an anonymous account of a woman who said she had had a two - year affair with the mayor after he had pursued her following a council function			1
newspapers followed the story , soon identifying @entity71 as the woman in the account , which included salacious claims that the pair had liaisons on council time and council premises , including once being caught in flagrante by a security guard in the town hall			2
@entity115 subsequently confirmed that @entity71 was the woman in the story			0
@entity14 appeared on the television show @entity136 to confirm he had had an affair , requesting privacy to resolve issues with his family			1
he said he had no intention to resign , and that the exposure of the affair reflected a " clear will or determination to try and force a resignation , to try and in effect destroy me			2
" pressure mounted further on the mayor after the @entity104 reported -- and the mayor 's office later confirmed -- that @entity14 had written a reference that helped secure his lover a job at the city art gallery , a council subsidiary			1
the council then announced that it was opening an inquiry into the matter to determine whether @entity14 used council funds in the relationship and whether any aspect of his behavior contravened the council 's code of ethics			1
@entity14 had stated in his @entity136 interview that no inappropriate spending of council funds took place			1
but the story took a turn after @entity71 , having denied her revelations were politically motivated , told the @entity104 that she had been pressured into speaking to the blogger by @entity179 , with whom she said she had had an intimate relationship			0
saying her world had begun " falling apart " after she missed out on a board seat in the elections , she told the newspaper she regretted going public and now wanted to apologize to the mayor			1
the newspaper published social media exchanges provided by @entity71 that appeared to back up her claims of a relationship between her and @entity179 , and of his encouragement for her to gather evidence on @entity14			1
@entity0 was unable to independently confirm the authenticity of those exchanges			0
@entity106 had been an advisor to @entity194 , the center - right mayoral candidate who had polled second in the election ; @entity196 , father of blogger @entity115 , had also been a key adviser to his campaign			2
@entity106 denied to the @entity104 that he had been in a relationship with @entity71 , while @entity194 denied any previous knowledge of a relationship between his staffer and @entity71 to the newspaper			0
neither @entity179 nor @entity194 responded to @entity0 's requests for comment			2
speaking to @entity0 , the blogger @entity115 said he was not part of an organized center - right push to smear the mayor , and denied exploiting his source			1
the story had only come about after he was approached by @entity179 and @entity211 with texts that they said would embarrass the mayor			2
he said @entity71 initially had cold feet about going through with the article , but decided to proceed after receiving a text message from an anonymous number , warning her not to proceed			0
the identity of the sender is now a key question at the heart of the affair			2
" whoever sent that text message brought the whole thing to a head , " he said			0
@entity115 said he had chosen to proceed with the story as the issues of ethics , integrity and potential abuse of power it raised made it a " clear public interest issue			0
" " it 's not about presenting the lurid details of an affair , " he said			1
" you 've got the second most powerful politician in @entity16 ... controlling the largest city , billions of dollars in ratepayers ' money and answerable to no one except the public			1
" he was happy if blogging about the private lives of politicians helped bring about greater integrity , he said			0
" in the @entity252 these things are reported as a matter of course			0
it happens in @entity256 and the @entity257 as well -- look at the @entity3 case			0
@entity16 for too long has sat in a cozy arrangement because the politicians and the media are too close			2
there has been a mutually assured destruction mentality that does n't provide well for democracy			0
" he believed the traditional media would have broken the story too if it had the scoop			0
" everyone 's being sanctimonious and pointing the finger at this nasty blogger who has breached all these protocols			2
well you know what ? those protocols do n't actually exist			0
there 's no rules , " he said			2
" the evidence they would have done it , is that the next day the largest daily in the country splashed five pages on this scandal			2
" @entity285 said it was hard to assess whether the story was a case of legitimate " public interest or just something the public have an interest in			0
" " it 's pretty hard to see which category it falls into			0
at the start it did seem more prurient , but each revelation seems to shift the story more into the political sphere			0
" local politics was traditionally viewed as low - stakes and boring , but the 2010 amalgamation of @entity15 's seven existing city and district councils into one " super city " had given the new " super mayor " unprecedented powers that made him a more attractive scalp for his enemies			1
with unscientific polls in @entity16 media roughly split between those who believed the mayor should stay and those who said he should go , it was hard to call what the politician 's fate would be			1
" at this stage it 's looking more likely than not that he 's going to have to do something -- either resign or put himself up for re-election , " he said .			0
