the legislative panel investigating the @entity4 scandal was unable to determine whether @entity6 gov. @entity5 knew about the lane closures ahead of time , but the panel will continue to push for more answers , the co-chairman of the panel told @entity11			1
@entity6 state assemblyman @entity12 , a @entity13 , confirmed to @entity11 in a text message thursday an earlier @entity16 piece previewing the panel 's report resulting from its months - long investigation into the lane closures			1
@entity11 obtained a copy of the report friday			1
according to the @entity16 , which received a copy of the report , it declares there was " no conclusive evidence " that @entity5 " was or was not aware " of the lane closures on the @entity4 before or while they were happening			1
it also states , however , that a " former ally " made accusations that leave " open the question of when the governor first learned of the closures and what he was told			0
" " the report is not inconclusive , " @entity12 said in the text message			0
" it says , among other things , that because we have been unable to interview certain witnesses , it is not possible to determine whether the governor did or did not know about the lane closures in advance			1
" asked whether the panel would continue to pursue the investigation , @entity12 said , " we are not done by any means			1
" in a separate phone exchange with @entity11 's @entity47 , @entity12 said the report will bring some new facts to light " that will certainly raise additional questions			0
" the panel is waiting , he said , for the @entity55 attorney , who is doing his own investigation , to give members the go - ahead to interview several key players			0
the lane closures in september of last year snarled traffic in @entity62 , @entity6 , in an act the report suggests was meant as political retribution against the town 's @entity67 mayor			2
two central figures in the lane closures were not accessible to legislative investigators : @entity72 , @entity5 's appointee at the @entity74 and @entity6 who orchestrated the closures , and @entity5 's former deputy chief of staff , @entity77 , who wrote an email declaring it was " @entity79 for some traffic problems in @entity62			1
" @entity12 told @entity47 that the report is a chronology of everything the committee has learned starting with @entity77 's now infamous email , but larger questions remain over the motive of the closures			2
an internal investigation ordered by @entity5 earlier this year absolved him of responsibility as well , and many of his supporters have decried the legislative inquiry as a political witch hunt aimed at him by @entity67 looking to damage him before his expected 2016 presidential run			2
@entity98 , the lead attorney for the internal investigation , argued the legislative committee 's work " has simply corroborated " the administration 's probe			0
" @entity104 has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago -- namely , that there is not a shred of evidence governor @entity5 knew anything about the @entity4 lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision , " @entity98 said in a written statement			2
the scandal itself did indeed damage him within the @entity118 , raising questions among some major party donors and strategists over whether more could come of the scandal			0
he has , however , regained some of his stature because of his successful tenure as chairman of the @entity127 , during which he raked in record - breaking fundraising hauls for the committee			0
a @entity11 / @entity131 poll out this week showed @entity5 in fourth place in the @entity118 field , taking 8 percent support and coming in behind former @entity136 gov. @entity135 , neurosurgeon @entity137 and former @entity118 presidential nominee @entity138 , who took first .			0

an investigation into @entity5 's knowledge of the bridge closures could not determine what he knew , when
the @entity16 obtained a copy of the panel 's report and previewed it thursday
a co-chairman of the panel said the investigators were unable to access certain witnesses
the co-chairman said the investigation will continue
