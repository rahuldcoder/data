@entity0 , @entity1 -- the coalition air effort to halt the @entity1 government 's attacks on civilians continued into thursday for a sixth day , with an airstrike in the @entity0 suburb of @entity10 , a government official said			1
on wednesday night , the government reported that military and civilian locations in the neighborhood of @entity15 and in the @entity17 district of the capital had been struck by " crusading colonial " bombardment			1
in response , @entity21 lt. cmdr			1
@entity23 said in an e-mail to @entity2 , " it is not likely that civilians were a part of any airstrike today			1
" he said coalition forces " have been using all necessary measures to protect the citizens of @entity1 from the violence and killing inflicted upon them by @entity33			1
" an opposition activist in @entity0 accused state media of lying about civilian victims of the coalition airstrikes			1
for example , she said , she was accompanying a cousin to a hospital for medical care when she saw a tv producer asking some people to close their eyes and play dead and others to pretend they were wounded			1
some of the " wounded , " she said , were soldiers in civilian garb			2
on wednesday , government officials invited @entity2 and other journalists to visit a house in @entity0 that had been damaged in an air raid , but -- after driving around for more than half an hour -- were apparently unable to find it and so returned the journalists to their hotel			1
the drive revealed a city quieter than normal -- about half the stores were closed			2
people appeared apprehensive , anxious			2
opponents of @entity33 were afraid to speak publicly			2
in @entity66 , parts of the city fell to opposition forces even though @entity33 's men , who had been pounding the area with artillery and heavy tank bombardments , retained control of the northern and western gates , opposition fighters and witnesses told @entity2			2
a hospital staffer and opposition fighters said nine people were killed wednesday in fighting near the northern gate			1
so far , the coalition has crippled the @entity1 air force , and established a no - fly zone that spans @entity1 from east to west along its coastline , said @entity83 rear adm. @entity82			1
@entity82 , the chief of staff for @entity85 operations said wednesday that coalition planes had flown 175 sorties over @entity1 -- 113 of them by @entity85 planes			1
but the coalition had no indication that @entity1 leader @entity91 was complying with a @entity93 mandate to stop attacks against civilians			1
on wednesday , troops loyal to @entity33 terrorized residents of the besieged rebel - held city of @entity100			2
one witness said @entity33 's forces had attacked the city 's main hospital , where 400 people -- about half of them patients -- were located			1
the push began at 8 p.m. ( 2 p.m. et ) , when " heavy tanks for @entity33 troops start attacking the hospital -- the bombs falling here 20 meters ( 66 feet ) around us , " said one person inside the hospital			1
he said two deaths had occurred " around the hospital			1
" at one point , shelling occurred without respite for 40 minutes , he said			2
" now , fortunately , no more shelling , but the situation is so serious that all the teams here -- the doctors , the patients -- are paralyzed , scared			1
" he called for international intervention to protect the civilians inside the institution			2
" nobody can work here , " he said			2
ambulances were not able to leave the hospital , which had lost its electricity and was using generator power , he said			1
coalition jets are using smart bombs to target mechanized forces and mobile surface - to - air missile sites and impede supply lines for their " beans and bullets , " @entity82 said			1
the targets include @entity1 's premier @entity145 , commanded by one of @entity33 's sons and fully engaged in the fighting			2
" it 's an extremely complex and difficult environment , " @entity82 said about going after forces in populated areas			2
" and our primary focus is to interdict those forces before they enter the city ... cut off their lines of communication and cut off their command and control , " he said			2
" there have been no reports of civilian casualties			2
our mission here is to protect the civilian populace and we choose our targets and plan our actions with that as our top priority			2
" wednesday night 's outbreak of violence broke a respite that began earlier in the day with the coalition attacks -- the first calm in a week , @entity100 residents reported			1
" we would like to express our gratitude to the international community since there were airstrikes this morning , " said @entity176 , an opposition spokesman in the city who would identify himself only by his first name			2
@entity33 's forces had been stationed on the outskirts of the city , where they were providing support and supplies to loyalists fighting rebels in @entity100 proper			2
earlier in the day , grocery stores and other shops opened in the city , which is located two hours east of @entity0 and has been inaccessible to journalists			1
one person inside the hospital told @entity2 that five more people were killed in the last 24 hours , raising the death toll to at least 95 in the last seven days			1
a man who died wednesday morning was shot by a sniper , the person said			0
gen. @entity204 , a former interior minister who quit to lead opposition forces , said rebels have requested weapons from several nations to help the embattled city			0
" @entity100 is destroyed and they need weapons , " @entity204 told @entity2			0
" we try to send them weapons , but of course they were all light weapons			0
there were no heavy weapons			0
" asked about the situation in @entity100 , deputy national security adviser for strategic communications @entity217 said , " we 're concerned about it , but i think you 're actually seeing some indications that the effort of the coalition is ... focused on @entity100 and is having an effect there			1
" the rapid advance of @entity1 forces had been halted , particularly their move toward the nation 's second - largest city , @entity231 , @entity217 told reporters aboard @entity233			0
@entity1 's elite forces are drawn from tribes loyal to @entity33			0
though they comprise no more than 10,000 men , those forces are on the offense , @entity82 said			0
" those forces are fully - engaged in this conflict , that are attacking those civilian populations , " he added			0
though the rebels are in a better position than they were a few days ago , the @entity33 forces have the upper edge , a @entity85 official said			1
they remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition , are relatively well - organized and continue to fight effectively , the official said			1
@entity217 predicted the transition of command and control to another entity would be effected in " a matter of days			0
" @entity256 will likely play a key role in the command and control , he said , adding that he would not describe the conflict as " an open - ended war , a land invasion in @entity1			1
" the international airstrikes against @entity1 military positions began over the weekend after @entity33 defied a @entity93 - mandated cease - fire in attacks against civilians			0
the strikes are intended to help establish a no - fly zone			0
@entity268 announced wednesday it has frozen more than $ 1.53 billion in @entity1 assets in response to @entity272 sanctions imposed on the northern @entity274 country			0
@entity275 launched the air campaign in @entity1 and @entity277 and the @entity85 followed			1
@entity278 is not participating in the military action , though it agrees with the @entity93 resolution in principle , and moved wednesday to ensure that its ships were far removed from the @entity1 campaign			0
a @entity278 navy spokesman said wednesday that all @entity278 ships previously under @entity256 command in the @entity287 were reassigned to operate under national command and are returning to previously scheduled port stops in @entity290 to await further instructions			0
@entity278 crew members of @entity256 fighter jets were also under @entity278 command			0
@entity277 has announced an international meeting for next tuesday to assess the situation in @entity1			0
the war was sparked in february by protests demanding an end to @entity33 's nearly 42 - year rule			0
the @entity1 strongman responded with force against civilians , prompting the international community to take action			0
however , a @entity307 professor said the coalition can achieve only so much through aerial strikes			1
" we have to understand the limits of what air power can do , " @entity310 told @entity2 's " @entity315			0
" " this is a recipe for a stalemate , " he said			0
criticism and questions persist about the international campaign , with no clear answer on who will take over command of the mission and what the exit strategy will be			0
@entity85 president @entity327 said the timetable for a transition of military leadership will be coming in days , not weeks			1
@entity256 said wednesday it will decide shortly what its role in the operation will be			0
a spokesman added the alliance is well prepared			0
" this is the bread and butter of @entity256 , " an official said			1
@entity275 foreign minister @entity339 has voiced his opposition to @entity256 taking political leadership over the @entity1 campaign			0
he suggested that a commission composed of foreign ministers from the participating states play that role			0
@entity310 , however , said the @entity348 world would welcome @entity256 involvement			0
" they know that the calamity is unfolding in @entity1 , and they know that no help is going to come other than from the @entity354 and from the @entity85			1
" @entity277 prime minister @entity355 said wednesday that @entity356 and @entity357 have agreed to provide logistical support to the @entity1 effort			1
@entity357 government spokesman @entity360 told @entity2 that @entity357 's role will be limited to a humanitarian one			1

@entity366 has already contributed planes to mission			0
the @entity369 said tuesday it will participate -- but only in providing humanitarian assistance			0
