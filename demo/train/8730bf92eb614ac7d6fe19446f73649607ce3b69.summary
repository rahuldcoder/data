this is @entity1 , and it 's a good time to set the record straight on autism and violence			1
after @entity7 , there was a lot of talk about whether shooter @entity10 had @entity13 's syndrome , a form of autism , and , if so , whether that played a role in his violent behavior			1
the response from people touched by autism and autism professionals was immediate and unequivocal : there is no connection between any autism spectrum disorder and violent aggression			1
unfortunately , stating the facts did little to stop the speculation			1
it 's almost as if people wanted to " make it so " as an easy way to explain the inexplicable			1
every new story seemed to mention @entity13 's in the headline or opening lines			1
the implied connection was unmistakable			2
the truth is , people with autism are far more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators			1
even in our supposedly enlightened society , anyone who is different can become a magnet for bullies and predators			2
growing up with undiagnosed @entity13 's , i learned that the hard way			1
so did my son , @entity50 ( i call him @entity51 ) , who also has @entity13 's			1
i 'd sensed that all my life , but it 's also supported by scientific studies , in both medical and criminal justice research			1
opinion : i have @entity13 's and i 'm just like you those of us on the autism spectrum have enough problems simply being different in an often intolerant world			1
thanks to our limited sense of the emotions swirling around us , we live in the shadow of often unseen threats , as so many of us have learned to our detriment			0
the unspoken emotional subtext that most people take for granted is mysterious and invisible to us			0
our oblivion leads to bad feeling , and we never know exactly how and where we went wrong			2
media talk of @entity13 's and murder -- even when it 's only speculation -- raises that threat level significantly			1
insinuations like this dehumanize people with @entity13 's and label us as " sociopaths " or " future attackers			1
" where does that lead ? exclusion , bullying and mistreatment , even more than before			0
troubling legacy of @entity7 may create backlash against kids with autism prejudice affects us in many ways , most all of which are bad			1
my son found that out four years ago , when a state prosecutor decided that his scientific fascination with explosives was a terrorist threat and only she could " save " our community			0
she charged him with four felonies , carrying a maximum sentence of more than 60 years in prison			0
growing up autistic @entity51 was 17 years old when he was indicted			0
he 'd never been in trouble with either the law or in school , and was on track to make @entity113 , where he taught the chemistry merit badge course			0
his only " crime " was turning household chemicals into experimental explosives , which he set off and filmed in the woods behind our house			0
even the @entity123 agents who first investigated were impressed by @entity51 's scientific acumen and curiosity and certain that he intended no harm			2
it took a year of our lives , $ 100,000 and a weeklong jury trial to set the record straight			0
at the end the prosecutor just walked away , as do most bullies and predators			0
our society can be awful long on prejudgment and woefully short on consequences			0
it 's time to change the conversation			2
@entity13 's does n't make a person a killer or a terrorist			1
it 's the disturbing truth that anyone can turn violent or deadly , and it 's proven very difficult to identify who 's vulnerable and what the trigger might be			2
opinion : leave autism out of mass shootings psychologist @entity152 showed that we all have a dark side , one that can emerge quite suddenly , in his famous @entity157 , which was cut off early when students who played prison guards became sadistic and those who played prisoners became depressed			2
indeed , most of the rampage killers of the past 30 years apparently popped up out of nowhere			0
what did we miss ? the central question for us as a society should be : how can we identify those people at risk for aggressive violence , and get them support while help is still an option ? i believe violence should be a research priority at the @entity173 and the @entity174			2
after the fact analysis does n't help anyone , and it wo n't bring back the dead			0
we need to understand what makes people turn on others and how we can defuse that threat			0
groups : autism not to blame for violence at the same time , we must learn to stop the rush to judgment when the person next to us acts " a little strange			1
" eccentric people have brought humanity some of its greatest gifts and inventions , and we need to encourage difference , not chase it into hiding			0
imagine where we 'd be today if @entity196 , who invented dynamite , had been prosecuted like my son -- instead of praised for his service to humanity .			0

@entity203 : *debunk* " link " between autism and violence this @entity1
@entity203 : reports that @entity13 's sparked @entity7 shooter spread prejudice
having @entity13 's , he says , and being different is bad enough without that myth
we need to stop looking for easy answers and find out what really causes violence , he says
