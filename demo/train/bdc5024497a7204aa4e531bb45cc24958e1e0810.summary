-- today they are lawmakers , professors and grandparents			1
but 50 years ago , they were the young faces of the civil rights movement , who headed to the nation 's capital -- even if it meant hitchhiking -- to be a part of history			1
these men and women joined nearly a quarter of a million others from across the country to take part in the march on @entity19 on august 28 , 1963 , a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement			1
some even had chance encounters with civil rights leader @entity23 the most famous moment of the march was @entity23 's " @entity31 " speech , which he delivered from a podium at the @entity28 to a crowd of an estimated 210,000 people			1
photographer captures faces of the march many thought the event would descend into violence , but it did not			1
there were 5,000 police officers , @entity40 and @entity41 , but no marchers were arrested , and no incidents concerning marchers were reported			1
the march was the culmination of the civil rights movement , and it is credited for helping spur lawmakers to pass the @entity49 in 1964 and the @entity50 in 1965			1
there were civil rights leaders , @entity54 celebrities and thousands of ordinary people who knew it was time for the @entity58 to give the same rights to everyone , regardless of race			1
@entity0 caught up with a few of those marchers today			1
@entity65 's difficult journey @entity66 @entity66 was a college student just looking for a summer job when she got hired as the receptionist at the @entity70 planning office			2
" i do n't think i had a title , " @entity66 recalled			2
" i answered the phones			2
" she had 10 phone lines to answer , and they rang from the time she walked in until she left for the day			2
" i recall one day i 'll never forget , i heard someone say , ' where is this young lady who handles the phone ? ' and finally i looked up , and there he was -- dr. @entity23 -- and he said , ' i want to meet this young lady			2
she has put me on the hold twice , and hung up on me once , and i want to know who she is			2
' " @entity66 said she was " so embarrassed , " but then the civil rights icon gave her a hug			2
by the day of the march , she was so tired , she dozed off and accidentally slept through the historic march and the " @entity31 " speech			1
after a career practicing law -- including a case involving the government 's wiretapping of @entity23 -- @entity66 has been a law professor at @entity93 since 2004			2
lessons from successful movements @entity96 at 23 years old , @entity96 was the youngest speaker at the march on @entity19 and probably the most controversial			1
he had just been elected to lead the @entity97			2
@entity96 ' father was a sharecropper in rural @entity100 , where he grew up and went to segregated schools			2
according to his biography , @entity96 " was inspired by the activism surrounding the @entity103 and the words of the rev. @entity23 , which he heard on radio broadcasts			2
" his prepared text for the march on @entity19 included a threat to march through the @entity111 like gen. @entity112 during the @entity113 unless there was progress on civil rights			1
that did n't sit well with his fellow civil rights leaders			2
" on the night of august 27 , 1963 , i received a note under my door from ( march organizer ) @entity122 saying , in effect , that there was some concern about my speech , " @entity96 said			1
" my speech was pretty strong			2
" another march organizer , @entity127 , also asked @entity96 to edit his speech			1
" and mr. @entity127 came and said , ' @entity96 , we come this far together			2
can you change this ? can you delete that ? let 's stay together , ' " @entity96 recalled			0
today , @entity96 , 73 , is the only surviving speaker			0
he has represented @entity136 in the @entity137 for 14 consecutive terms			0
some days , he still walks down to the @entity28 to stand where they all once stood			0
@entity23 memorial ready for anniversary @entity143 @entity143 knew the dark side of the civil rights movement			0
a month after the student protests in @entity147 , @entity100 , turned violent , @entity143 -- 15 years old at the time -- joined anti-segregation demonstrations in @entity150 , @entity100			1
police responded with force , cracking down with batons and prods , and arresting more than 460			0
@entity143 still lives with burn scars from a cattle prod			0
months later , @entity143 and two of his friends were determined to get to @entity19 for the march on @entity19			1
they could n't afford to make the trip via traditional means , so they decided to hitchhike the 700 miles between @entity150 and the nation 's capital			0
they walked at least a dozen miles up a dark highway before they got their first ride			0
after three days of hitchhiking , they arrived in @entity19 a week before the march			1
the three youths were put to work making signs for the march at the local headquarters			1
that weekend , a civil rights leader walked in and asked for them			0
he had been in @entity150 the night before , and their parents wanted him to check on them			0
@entity23 sat down with the three and talked to them for perhaps 20 minutes , asking them about their dreams			0
today , @entity143 continues to serve as a city councilman in @entity150 , a position he has held since 1986			0
the only class mlk taught @entity187 @entity187 , a popular actor and @entity190 - winning singer in the 1960s , used his star power to help bring other celebrities to the march on @entity19			1
" for myself personally -- beyond raising money , beyond speaking at events that helped to raise money to bring citizens to the @entity197 -- my task , my larger task , was to organize a cultural contingency to come to the march on @entity19 , " @entity187 reflected			1
besides reaching out to the stars themselves , @entity187 went to many of the studio heads in @entity54 to get prominent actors and actresses temporarily released from their duties so they could participate			0
the @entity54 list of attendees that day read like a who 's who of a-listers : @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 , who also gave a speech			0
but having the @entity54 stars there was n't just for show or for increased media attention			0
it also helped calm president @entity228 's nerves about the march			1
" i believe that their presence did a lot to assuage people who are preoccupied with the fact there could be violence , " @entity187 said			0
" one of the things that i said in my conversations with the @entity240 in discussing why they should be more yielding in their support of our demonstration was the fact that there would be such a presence of highly profiled artists -- that that alone would put anxiety to rest , " he added			0
" people would be looking at the occasion in a far more festive way			0
" @entity187 continued his acting and singing career , and today , at 86 , he is still an activist for human rights causes			0
at the @entity70 : the anger , fear , love and hope @entity261 @entity261 took a break from her job at the @entity264 in 1963 to be in charge of march on @entity19 transportation -- despite the fact she could n't even drive			1
" and i was totally horrified and frightened about this notion , " she said			0
" and i said something that also in retrospect seems fairly silly			0
' how can i be the transportation director ? i ca n't drive , ' which i could n't			0
and also i had lost my bus on every previous march			1
" but with the encouragement of her mentor and future lifelong colleague , march organizer @entity122 , @entity261 proceeded to organize all the buses , trains and planes for the more than 200,000 people who attended the march that day			1
in a time long before e-mail and @entity285 , this was no easy task			0
@entity261 used a system of 5x3 index cards and massive lists attached to the office walls to keep track of all the various travel options			0
after her months of tedious work came to fruition with a well - attended and successful march , @entity261 reveled in the moment at the end of the day			1
" all of us who had worked on the march , " continued @entity261 , " were just incredibly happy and pleased with what had happened			1
and we all linked hands and sang ' we shall overcome			0
' " @entity261 went on to be @entity122 's assistant and eventually served as the political director for the @entity303 .			0
