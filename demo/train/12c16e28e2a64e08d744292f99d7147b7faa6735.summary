reports wednesday that three men have been arrested over plans to travel from @entity3 to join @entity4 -- and that one of them allegedly posted online about his desire to shoot the @entity7 -- is simply the latest reminder that terrorist groups and their sympathizers are exploiting the freedom of cyberspace			1
earlier this month , @entity4 posted a video of its horrific burning of a captured @entity16 pilot			2
unfortunately , this was not the first time @entity4 has used @entity17 , an @entity18 social media company , to broadcast its barbaric acts to the world			1
in august , when @entity4 released the gruesome beheading of @entity18 journalist @entity23 , it also used social media			1
in fact , @entity4 has been using @entity17 for years			2
nor is @entity4 the only terrorist group on @entity17			2
@entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity30 branch in @entity31 , @entity32 , are all on @entity17			0
on january 14 , the @entity30 branch in @entity34 , known as @entity35 or simply @entity35 , claimed responsibility via @entity17 for the terrorist attacks in @entity38 that killed 17 people			2
the group has two official accounts on @entity17			0
there are many more examples from such groups , all of which have officially been listed as foreign designated terrorist organizations by the @entity18 government			2
it 's with this reality in mind that on january 27 , my subcommittee held a hearing on terrorists ' use of social media			1
at those hearings , experts detailed how terrorist use of social media platforms has long been a problem			1
if social media is being used to help radicalize thousands of people and raise millions of dollars from many more , the question all this raises is this : why is no one shutting them down ? because @entity18 companies are n't			1
and nor is the @entity18 government			0
i 've heard two arguments for why we should keep the status quo			0
the first -- and easiest to set aside -- is the claim that if the @entity18 government were to shut down terrorists ' social media accounts , these measures would be violating terrorists ' free speech rights			1
my own belief is that the @entity82 does not apply to terrorists			0
these thugs gave up their right to free speech the first time they killed innocent civilians			1
we should certainly not be helping them kill more			0
but this is n't just my thinking			0
the @entity92 has already held this to be the case in @entity95 , when it ruled that if someone has aided a terrorist organization , their free speech rights were not protected			1
indeed , free speech does not apply when it harms others , such as creating and distributing child pornography			1
the second argument is that terrorists ' use of social media provides the intelligence community with information that they would not otherwise be able to acquire			1
but while terrorists may slip up from time to time , they are also aware that by its very nature , social media is about sharing , which means what they say can easily become widely shared			1
nor is terrorist use of social media a new phenomenon			1
we have had years to weigh the kind of intelligence that we can gather about terrorist groups against the advantages in messaging and recruitment that terrorists gain from it			1
and from what i have heard , allowing this public , online jihad to continue has provided no significant intelligence breakthroughs			0
the fact that there are more terrorists using social media than ever before should say all we need to know about whether they are benefiting from it			1
to put it bluntly , private @entity18 companies should not be operating as the propaganda megaphone of foreign terrorist organizations			2
so what needs to change ? for a start , social media companies themselves need to do more			1
it is not good enough to only pay attention when bad press threatens a company 's public image after something truly horrific is posted online			0
instead , companies not only have a public responsibility but a legal obligation to do more			0
section 219 of the @entity153 states that it is unlawful to provide a designated foreign terrorist organization with " material support or resources , " including " any property , tangible or intangible , or services			2
" that 's about as comprehensive as you can get			0
what 's more , most social media companies already have terms of service with prohibition of threats of violence that would preclude terrorist use of their platforms			1
but companies need to do a better job of enforcing their own terms			0
the lack of child pornography or stolen copyrighted material on social media platforms -- content that is quickly removed if it appears at all -- demonstrates what these companies can do			2
with this in mind , they would do well to consider having dedicated teams that remove terrorist content , and also streamline reporting processes for offensive content so users can easily report terrorist use on their platforms			2
companies have the technology and the resources to crack down on terrorists ' use of their platform ; they just need the motivation to act			0
this is where the federal government can assist			0
in 2011 , the @entity203 promised a strategy to prevent online radicalization			0
but more than three years later -- and despite a summit last week aimed at tackling extremism -- we are still waiting on a that strategy			0
without one , the federal government 's efforts to combat terrorist use of social media will be as haphazard and lackluster as the efforts of private social media companies			1
instead , we need a strategy that clearly articulates our goals and roles , and the responsibilities of each federal agency that needs to be involved , as well as how we are going to work with civil society			0
it is mindboggling to think that those who behead and burn others alive are able to use our own companies against us to further their cause			0
but that is exactly what is occurring			0
@entity18 newspapers would have never allowed the @entity230 to place an ad for recruitment during @entity233 should not be allowed to use private @entity18 companies to reach billions of people with their violent propaganda in an instant , all for free .			2
