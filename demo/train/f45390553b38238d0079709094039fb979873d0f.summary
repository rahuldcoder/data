the beheading of @entity2 aid worker @entity1 by @entity3 has intensified fears for other @entity6 hostages being held by the jihadist group			1
@entity1 ' grisly execution follows those of @entity12 journalists @entity10 and @entity13 in recent weeks -- all of them shown in videos posted online			1
@entity3 militants have killed thousands of @entity18 and @entity19 in their violent onslaught aimed at building an @entity22 caliphate across a wide area of territory			1
but the beheading of @entity6 captives carries greater shock value beyond the region -- and works as a powerful propaganda tool for a group that has drawn members from @entity32 and @entity33			1
" @entity3 looks at this as a low cost strategy , " said @entity34 , professor of security studies at @entity36			2
" they are seeing that in order to capture the world 's attention and recruit people , they no longer need to take down the @entity45 or hit the @entity46			0
" as the @entity12 builds an international coalition to take on the @entity50 extremist group in both @entity19 and @entity18 , uncertainty remains about exactly how many more @entity6 hostages the militants have in their possession			1
what is the world going to do about @entity3 ? has @entity3 identified any of its other @entity6 captives ? in the video of @entity1 ' killing , the black - clad @entity3 executioner places his hand on another hostage , whom he identifies as @entity63 , a @entity2 citizen			1
the implied threat is clear			0
@entity13 appeared in the same way in the video of @entity10 's beheading			1
@entity1 appeared similarly in the video of @entity13 's death			2
on sunday , @entity63 's family distributed an image of him holding a child at a refugee camp on the @entity18 - @entity75 border			2
the family asked media to use this image rather than the one of @entity63 in an orange jumpsuit kneeling beside his captor			0
are any other @entity12 being held ? @entity3 is believed to be holding a number of @entity12 , a @entity12 official told @entity83 in august after @entity10 's execution			1
the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , declined to identify them or say exactly how many @entity12 are being held			2
@entity83 national security analyst @entity88 reports that @entity3 is understood to be holding at least two other @entity12 citizens , as well as hostages from additional @entity6 countries			1
two @entity93 women were reported in august to be among the militant group 's newest captives			2
a @entity96 and a @entity98 national were said to be seized along with the two @entity93			0
it 's hard to know how many captives there are because governments , employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release			2
have the identities of any missing @entity12 been made public ? the family of one missing @entity12 journalist , @entity113 , has talked to the media about his case			1
but it 's not clear which group in @entity18 's brutal civil war might be holding him			2
@entity113 , a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to the @entity121 and other news outlets , disappeared in @entity18 in august 2012			1
a shaky video uploaded to @entity124 in october 2012 showed @entity113 blindfolded and in obvious distress			1
it was unclear who the people holding him were			0
the @entity130 said at the time that it believed @entity113 was in the custody of the @entity18 government -- but the regime of president @entity134 has n't admitted detaining him			1
@entity113 's parents spoke last week to @entity136 about their concerns for their 33 - year - old son			1
" i do not accept that he is missing , i live in a place where he is coming home , " said @entity139 , his mother			0
she described hearing the news of the killings of @entity10 and @entity13 as " a gut punch			0
" what about other journalists ? the @entity149 estimates that about 20 journalists are missing in @entity18 -- most of them local , some from outside @entity18			0
it says many of them are believed to be held by @entity3			1
altogether , more than 80 journalists have been abducted in @entity18 since the country 's civil war started , according to the cpj			0
some have been freed , others killed			0
often a media blackout on journalists ' abductions is lifted generally in best - and worst - case scenarios			0
which westerners have been released in @entity18 ? @entity12 journalist @entity164 was handed over to @entity166 peacekeepers in august by @entity167 , a @entity18 rebel group with @entity169 ties , after almost two years in captivity			1
@entity173 officials helped secure his release , his family said			0
two @entity176 journalists -- @entity177 and @entity178 -- were freed in march			0
at the time of their capture , their newspaper said the journalists ' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to @entity3			2
four @entity188 journalists -- @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 -- were released in april			0
and a @entity96 photographer , @entity194 , was freed in june , the @entity193 said			0
why are some hostages freed and others killed ? a multitude of factors are at work , including who the captors are and where the captives come from			2
different @entity6 governments take different approaches to kidnappings			2
@entity2 and the @entity12 are known to take hard line , refusing to negotiate with terrorists or pay ransoms			1
but some @entity211 governments are believed to have handed over cash to terrorist groups to ensure the release of their citizens			0
an investigation by @entity218 found that @entity169 and its affiliates have netted at least $ 125 million in ransoms since 2008 , with much of the revenue reportedly coming from @entity188 -- although the @entity188 government denied paying money to terrorists			0
what about getting the hostages out by force ? the @entity12 and other countries attempted hostage rescues , but these have achieved mixed results			1
in 2012 , @entity231 saved @entity12 aid worker @entity232 and fellow aid worker @entity233 of @entity96 after three months ' captivity in @entity236			1
but the attempts can also go badly wrong			0
@entity238 , a kidnapped @entity2 aid worker , was accidentally killed by a @entity12 grenade during a seal rescue effort in @entity241 in 2010			1
@entity12 special operations forces went into @entity18 in july to try to retrieve @entity10 and other @entity3 captives			1
but the mission failed after the commandos were unable to find the hostages			0
the @entity2 government said earlier this month an attempt was made to rescue @entity1 " some time ago " but was unsuccessful			0
it declined to provide details on what happened			0
who is doing what in the coalition battle against @entity3 ?			0

@entity3 is believed to be have at least two more @entity12 captives
it is also holding hostages from other @entity6 countries
the latest beheading video identified a @entity2 citizen
it 's not known who 's holding @entity12 journalist @entity113 , who disappeared in 2012
