sen. @entity0 slammed the @entity1 on tuesday for a " failure of leadership " as president @entity4 prepares to nominate his administration 's fourth defense secretary			1
the @entity8 @entity7 , who is considering a 2016 run in hopes of heading his own @entity1 administration , called the unusually high turnover at the helm of the @entity17 emblematic of a @entity1 that puts politics above @entity20 national security			2
" it seems what the administration is looking for is a defense secretary who will follow the orders of a political @entity1 rather than focus on defending the national security interests of this country , " @entity0 said			1
" at a time when the threats are this grave , we should n't see turnover at the @entity17 than one has at a typical @entity33			0
" @entity0 said he did not know @entity34 , the former no. 2 man at the @entity17 who is expected to be @entity4 's nominee to succeed defense secretary @entity36 , but @entity0 said he looks forward to learning more about @entity34 and his " good reputation			2
" but @entity0 emphasized he was unsettled to see several potential picks pull their names out of the running to head the department , including former @entity17 official @entity42 and sen. @entity43			0
" it says something that so many people are saying , ' no , thank you , i do n't want to serve in an administration that overrides the @entity17 , that treats the defense secretary as subservient to political lackeys in the @entity1 , " @entity0 said			1
@entity0 made the remarks tuesday at an event cosponsored by @entity54 of @entity20 and the conservative publication @entity56 during which he bore out his hawkish foreign policy and staked out positions starkly in contrast to @entity4			1
@entity60 : @entity34 wo n't be heard at @entity1 drawing often from neoconservative sen. @entity60 , @entity0 laid out a foreign policy focused on reasserting @entity20 power and values in the world and " resolutely defending " @entity20 national security			1
and the first - term @entity8 senator also pulled from the pages of the @entity68 , saying leaders should engage the @entity20 military with a " clear and stated objective upfront " and attack with " overwhelming force ... and then we should get the heck out			0
" @entity0 also mocked the @entity4 administration 's failed " reset " with @entity77 and repeated his claim that @entity77 president @entity76 is a " @entity78 thug , " criticizing @entity4 's response to @entity77 military action in @entity81 with disbelief			1
" you literally can not make this stuff up			0
if ' @entity87 ' were parodying a hapless , ineffective president , they could n't make things up worse , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 also repeated his claim that the potential for a nuclear @entity92 is the " gravest national security threat " to the @entity20 right now and likened the @entity20 policy to combating @entity95 as " nonsense			0
" foreign policy is shaping up to be a top issue in the 2016 presidential election as the @entity95 threat , @entity92 nuclear negotiations and sanctions and continued tensions between the @entity20 and @entity77 loom large			2
about 54 percent of @entity20 disapprove of @entity4 's handling of foreign affairs , according to a @entity107 poll released last week .			0
