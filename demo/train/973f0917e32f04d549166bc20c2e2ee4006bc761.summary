looks like it 's a bad time to be sexing up your publicly viewable video gaming			1
with debate swirling over treatment of women in gaming , @entity3 , a service that lets users broadcast themselves playing games or watch others doing so , has banned " wearing no clothing or sexually suggestive clothing " in posts on the site			1
" nerds are sexy , and you 're all magnificent , beautiful creatures , but let 's try and keep this about the games , shall we ? " reads a section titled " dress ... appropriately " in @entity3 's @entity24 , which were updated tuesday			1
boasting more than 55 million monthly visitors , @entity3 was purchased by @entity27 in august for a reported $ 970 million			1
the near billion - dollar price tag , combined with the fact that other tech heavyweights like @entity31 were also pursuing a deal , highlights the massive popularity that video gaming has amassed as a spectator sport			2
under the new rules , gamers can be suspended from @entity3 for nudity or broadcasting themselves wearing items " including lingerie , swimsuits , pasties , and undergarments			1
" while dealing with a serious issue , the rules maintain a playful tone			0
" you may have a great six - pack , but that 's better shared on the beach during a 2 - on - 2 volleyball game blasting ' @entity55 , ' " read the rules , with a link to the iconic scene of that nature from the movie " @entity50			0
" " if it 's unbearably hot where you are , and you happen to have your shirt off ( gents ) or a bikini top ( ladies ) , then just crop the webcam to your face			0
if your lighting is hot , get fluorescent bulbs to reduce the heat			0
@entity67 does n't zoom ? move it closer to you , or turn it off			2
there is always a workaround			0
" while the post 's wording goes out of its way to note the rules apply to both men and women , it comes at a time when female game developers , journalists and players have been targeted with death and rape threats , among other abuse , linked to the so - called @entity87 movement			2
behind the furor over @entity87 ostensibly about ethics in video - game journalism , the movement quickly targeted " social justice warriors , " most of them women , who questioned the portrayal of women in video games as well as the treatment of women in the community			1
most recently , actress @entity100 , known for the gaming - oriented web series " @entity102 , " had her email and real - world address posted online less than an hour after a blog post in which she criticized @entity87			2
day had written that she feared retribution when she decided to share her views on the movement			0
in recent weeks , game designer @entity109 , gaming critic @entity111 and game designer @entity112 have all received threats of violence on @entity115 and other platforms .			0
