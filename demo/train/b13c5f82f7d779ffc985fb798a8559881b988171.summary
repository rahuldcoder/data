the good news is that news of the sign was shocking			1
because there was a time , not so very long ago -- a time remembered vividly by many living @entity4 -- when the sign would not have raised eyebrows , much less warranted national headlines			1
you may have seen the story earlier this month			2
the @entity10 upheld a ruling that a landlord in @entity13 who had posted a " @entity17 only " sign on the gate to her swimming pool had violated the @entity18			2
the landlord , @entity19 , who is white , said the sign was an antique , intended to be a decoration ; one of her tenants , @entity25 , filed the complaint because he believed the sign was placed to dissuade his daughter , who is @entity29 , from using the pool			1
each side has its own version of the story			2
but it received widespread coverage because the idea of such a sign , in 2012 , was so startling , and was so abhorrent to many people			2
such signs , though , well into the 20th century , were an accepted part of the @entity29 scene			1
if you 're not 50 years old yet , chances are pretty good that you never saw one in a public place			0
yet as late as the 1960s , they were there ; @entity49 , author of " @entity50 : the @entity55 of @entity56 , " told me that some in fact were in place through the 1970s			0
this nation had been around for more than 175 years ; more than a century had passed since the abolition of slavery ; and the signs still hung			0
the popular assumption has come to be that the signs , and what they represented , were limited to the @entity65 , but that was n't the case			1
in the 1930s and 1940s , photographers for the @entity69 , which later became part of the @entity71 , documented the @entity29 landscape			1
among the photographs , which are on file at the @entity76 , were shots of signs in small towns and large			0
the @entity65 is certainly abundantly represented in those photos : a " @entity102 " sign at the bus station in @entity83 , @entity84 , a " colored " sign at one entrance of a movie theater in @entity88 , @entity89 , a " colored " designation on a sign by a drinking fountain on the lawn of the county courthouse in @entity95 , @entity84 , a " @entity99 " sign at the bus terminal in @entity98			1
but there is also a photo taken in @entity105 , @entity106 , of a " @entity107 to @entity108 " sign in a restaurant window ; one of a man drinking from a " @entity114 " water cooler at a street car stop in @entity116 ; a " @entity17 " sign at a fountain in @entity119 , @entity120			1
because the signs were so commonplace , and because they went largely unchallenged , to see them for the first time , if you were a child just learning to read , was confusing , difficult to process			0
as a boy growing up in the 1950s , on a vacation trip to @entity129 with my parents , i saw the signs in neighborhood after neighborhood			0
restrooms for " whites , " restrooms for " colored , " drinking fountains on opposite ends of a wall , labeled according to the races that were supposed to partake of them			0
words , when you are for the first time able to read them yourself , contain great power , convey absolute authority			0
words on signs , to young eyes just becoming accustomed to deciphering them , represent official positions			1
and for so many years , the official position on so many signs in so many towns was : whites and blacks should not share public facilities			1
which is why it is meaningful that the swimming pool sign in @entity13 was considered prominent news this year			1
as the ubiquity of the " @entity17 " and " colored " signs fades into history , it is helpful to occasionally remind ourselves that this country may lose its way more often than we 'd like , and may make its share of mistakes , but we tend to try to get things right over the long haul			1
it would be difficult to make the argument that @entity4 live in a racial paradise today			2
the signs are long gone , though			0
it may have taken far too much time before the country figured out how wrong the signs , and what they signified , were , but the figuring out got done			0
when customs accepted for generations are harmful to the nation and to what it stands for , the customs eventually are tossed out			0
drunken driving used to be winked at ; cigarette companies once mocked claims that the product was bad for people ; @entity197 families were routinely turned away from " restricted " hotels			0
the @entity29 road is very long , and we 're all still on it			2
sometimes it 's a good idea to look at the signs by the side of the road -- particularly the ones that are no longer there			2

@entity212 : case of a recent @entity106 " whites only " sign points up ugly part of @entity4 history
he says such signs once not *uncommon* in @entity65 , and also @entity84 , even into the 1960s
he says children , in particular , absorb *messages* on signs ; *internalize* them as official
@entity212 : it 's meaningful that @entity106 story made news ; a reminder of the @entity29 *journey*
