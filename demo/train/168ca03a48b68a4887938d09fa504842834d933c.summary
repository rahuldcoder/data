in an exclusive interview with @entity0 , the @entity7 forward reveals how his onfield demeanor has left him sitting in the shadow of the sport 's golden boy and fans ' favorite , @entity15			1
" i do n't want to cry about it , but sometimes i think yes , " said @entity1 after being asked whether his image had cost him in the past			1
" it 's a question to which i never give the 100 % right answer , because sometimes i really do n't know			2
" i do n't think it 's allowed for people to change my personality			0
" maybe sometimes , i agree that i have a bad image on the pitch because i 'm too serious			2
" @entity1 and @entity15 will go head - to - head for the prestigious @entity27 in january , with the @entity29 star having won the award on each of the previous three occasions			1
@entity29 's unbeaten run ended by @entity34 both men have taken the sport to a new level with their record goalscoring feats -- @entity1 has scored an astonishing 164 times in 160 appearances for the @entity42 champions , while @entity15 hit 50 in @entity43 alone last term			1
@entity1 , who won the @entity27 in 2008 when at @entity45 , led @entity7 to the league title last season and has scored in his past six successive @entity48			1
the 27 - year - old @entity50 star is unhappy with how he 's often portrayed in the media compared to more " loveable " @entity15 and says he has become a " victim			1
" " but if you really know me , if you are my friend and i leave you inside my house and you share the day with me , you will know i hate to lose , " he said			0
" i learn by my mistakes and that 's life			0
you know , sometimes i 'm a victim of that because they do n't know the real @entity1			1
" but , this is part of the life			0
" @entity15 leads @entity27 nominations while @entity15 often plays with a smile on his face like a kid in the schoolyard , @entity1 is often seen moaning , gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire @entity7 to victory			1
but he insists that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance			0
" i was in the swimming pool with my girlfriend and sometimes we like to have a race , " he said			0
" sometimes you have to give her an opportunity to be happy but i win because i do n't like to lose			0
" it 's simple like that			0
can you imagine me on the pitch playing against players , playing against other teams , it 's not allowed to let them win			0
" i 'm a competitive man and sometimes people interpret that in a different way , which is a pain on me because i do n't like it , but i have to live			0
" @entity15 and @entity1 ensure honors shared in 222nd @entity89 while many sports stars are keen to stay clear of their critics , @entity1 is keen to embrace his and attempt to transform their opinions in the future			1
" people who call me arrogant , i 'm interested -- not with all of them , but most of them , " he added			2
" one day i would like to sit with them and have a chat to see in which way they think i 'm arrogant			2
" you know , to have a chat , in a nice place and for them to get to know me , you understand ? " because i think they need to sit with me to know who the real @entity1 is			2
