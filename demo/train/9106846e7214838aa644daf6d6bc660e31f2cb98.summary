@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 entered her 40th year in what can be called @entity5			1
a protestor locked in a suitcase reading " @entity8 " in @entity9 last year			0
a domestic worker from @entity11 , she arrived at a shelter in the @entity14 state of @entity1 one morning with only a nightgown , slippers , and a prayer for a better life			1

" i have not brought any clothes , i have not brought personal belongings , all i brought with me is a @entity22			0
" @entity23 says her employer -- a family with eight children who sponsored her journey here -- did not pay her the monthly salary of just over $ 100 for six months			2
having fled her employer 's home , she is now considered an illegal resident on the island			0
@entity34 , who runs the @entity35 , says the mind - set regarding immigrant workers here has got to change			2
some employers treat their help as " not a person but a machine ( that ) starts in the morning : put on a switch ( and ) work consistently right through the day			0
take care of the children , washing , cleaning , cooking , right down to cleaning ( the ) car			0
" the exploitation of workers is a huge business worldwide			2
people forced to work without pay collectively lose more than $ 20 billion a year in earnings , according to a report from the @entity59 @entity58 released tuesday			1
global profits from human trafficking and forced labor have reached $ 36 billion , according to the @entity59 , and that sum is climbing			1
" forced labor is the antithesis of decent work , " @entity58 director - general @entity64 said in a statement as the report became public			1
" it causes untold human suffering and steals from its victims			2
" " it is the vulnerable who suffer the most " in times of economic crisis like the present , the report says			2
it took years for governments to acknowledge the problem			0
now the biggest challenges , officials say , are the implementation and enforcement of laws			0
" eighty percent of forced labor is in the private economy , but this is very , very rarely been prosecuted , if at all in most countries , " said @entity87 , one of the authors of the @entity58 report			1
part of the problem is that the law is often hazy			0
" there 's a whole lot of gray areas where intermediate agents , sub-brokers , are taking advantage of loopholes in the law in order to extract large amounts of money from vulnerable people , uninformed ( people ) who are going off to work in a country where they do n't speak the language , " @entity87 said			0
but for him , the bottom line is clear			0
" there is some absolutely flagrant forced labor where the offenders must be put behind bars			1
forced labor is a serious criminal offense and must be treated as such , " he said			1
labor markets need a regulatory overhaul like the one financial markets are now facing , he argued			2
" because labor markets are too deregulated there are too many options for people to act in an unethical way , " he said			0
" after the havoc in the financial markets , people are realizing they need some monitoring , licensing , regulation			0
you 've got to do the same on the labor markets , " he said			0
the @entity58 tried to set standards for private agencies that place workers , he said			1
" but we 're finding is that there is a number of totally unknown , unlicensed and unregulated labor workers at the bottom end of the market , and there is broker after broker , intermediate after intermediate getting cash -- getting some money from the worker , " he said			1
" usually it is in the very much down the bottom in the informal sector , in the developing countries , but we are finding that sometimes this is pervading even larger recruitment agencies			0
" @entity1 , where @entity3 fled her employer , is considered a reformer on labor issues			1
the @entity14 state has introduced the @entity158 to register and track workers of all types			1
" people were not familiar with the definition of human trafficking and most of the time they were n't accepting that is phenomena is actually here in our region , " @entity161 of the country 's @entity162 said			1
a top priority is to reduce the role of middlemen who take sizable fees -- sometimes a year 's salary plus interest , he said			1
but worldwide , prosecutions are comparatively rare , said @entity181 , under secretary - general of the @entity59			1
" only a few thousand people were criminalized in the underworld in the past 2 - 3 years -- a fraction of the criminals who actually prey upon victims			0
