-- i recently left the @entity2 in @entity3 , inspired , empowered and hopeful , but extremely impatient to see radical changes to help women in @entity3 develop a world - class talent in science , technology , engineering , mathematics and businesses			1
throughout the event i saw women who were passionate entrepreneurs			1
they were all seeking new ways of growing their businesses			0
the women discussed challenges and barriers to success , and how to take their business to the next level			2
they wanted to grow their network and create global partnerships			0
women hold the key to @entity3 's development , from agriculture to technology and entrepreneurship			1
but they still face massive hurdles in many areas of development and they are still financially disadvantaged and lack confidence in starting up businesses in @entity3			1
mid-career dropout is frequent ; cultural and social boundaries also are hurdles women need to overcome every day			0
gender inequality is also a major issue for women looking to get loans from banks ; often , they are not taken seriously			1
in most @entity47 countries women account for a sizable part of the workforce , but still , there are not many places where women entrepreneurs can go for mentoring and support for their businesses			1
read this : ' african women need a hand - up not a hand - out ' ngos and global development organizations have for decades hidden the potential of @entity47 women by using them as objects of development and statistics			1
as @entity69 recently wrote , we should not see @entity47 women as objects of compassion , microloan applicants or demeaning factory - job seekers			0
you rarely see an @entity47 woman millionaire mentioned in the media , unless she is the daughter of the leader of @entity78 or an elite @entity81 / @entity80 graduate			0
those women do n't have the time or knowledge to mentor the grassroots of talented young women who are coding and developing apps in @entity88 , @entity89 , and @entity90 in @entity91			0
we need to make changes and start paying attention to these young women entrepreneurs in @entity3			1
technology presents new opportunities for @entity47 women who want to take their rightful place in society			1
african women are already using information technology to build networks and partnerships			1
sophisticated mobile phones owned by women in cities like @entity106 are being used to pass all sorts of information from factory to factory and village to village , delivering a message of openness and freedom			1
social media such as @entity117 and @entity118 has also helped them spread their stories			0
read this : 10 @entity47 tech voices to follow on @entity117 technology is also helping women shape the agricultural landscape by breaking down traditional social barriers			0
women can now get access to information on their land , stocks and even health matters			2
in @entity133 and @entity89 , women are using @entity134 to help plan for a family , with basic information on sex education and birth control being delivered on their cell phone			2
mobile money is also helping them to receive and send money safely and confidently			0
read this : fighting cancer with cell phones and women are also contributing to creating technology			2
recently , we have seen a rise of women coders in @entity89 , @entity91 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155			0
but increasing participation and representation of women across the continent is difficult when in many countries women are held back from full and fair participation in public and technological life			2
we have to build the pipelines for the next generation of african women leaders , and the only way we can do that is to start finding and creating a good ecosystem for women			0
with that in mind , @entity171 is this week celebrating five years of sharing positive ideas			0
the event is being held in @entity176 on june 21 and 22 , and the theme is " hands - on technology : rise of the makers , the dynamic and the disruptive thinkers in @entity3			2
" over two days , this conference for innovators , investors and those with a passion for our continent , will feature world - class speakers and roundtable sessions to cast a spotlight on change - makers , many of them women			2
and among other things , the event will demonstrate how @entity47 innovators -- especially women -- are taking the lead in developing amazing local technological solutions			0
