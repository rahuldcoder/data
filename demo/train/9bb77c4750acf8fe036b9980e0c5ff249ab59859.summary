@entity1 , @entity0 -- a @entity4 man in @entity5 lost his court battle friday for the legal right to be cremated in a traditional @entity4 open - air funeral pyre			1
most @entity9 believe open - air burning is the spiritually appropriate way to release a soul from the body			1
@entity14 , 70 , a world - renowned charity advocate in @entity5 , argued the practice is already legal under @entity5 law , but he sought clarification in order to hold such cremations in the future			1
@entity14 tested the law in 2006 when he lit the funeral pyre of a man in the northern @entity0 county of @entity26			2
he was never prosecuted , but the city council in @entity28 , where @entity14 lives , promptly ruled funeral pyres illegal			2
@entity14 , currently in @entity31 receiving medical treatment for what a spokesman described as debilitating high blood pressure and diabetes , said in a statement that he was saddened by friday 's verdict and will appeal			2
he has said he hopes for a traditional cremation when he dies			0
" i shall appeal until the very end , in the faith that my dying wish will not go unheard , " said @entity14			0
" a matter of such magnitude deserves to be heard by the highest courts in our land and i shall not tire until all legal avenues are exhausted			0
" current @entity5 law forbids cremation anywhere but in a crematorium			1
but @entity14 points to findings by judge @entity55 when , in 2007 , he determined @entity14 's case was important enough to go to trial			0
@entity55 said case law indicates that " burning of dead bodies in the open is not necessarily unlawful " and that the point is arguable in court			0
opponents say open - air cremation is unsanitary and hazardous to health and the environment			1
calculations based on @entity68 estimates of mortality rates suggest that in @entity31 alone , 50 million trees are cut down each year to create funeral pyres , generating more than 8 million tons of carbon dioxide			0
@entity14 has said he believes the practice is a religious right for @entity9 , who consider open - air cremations essential to the peace of the soul			1
such cremations are sanctioned by @entity4 scriptures , according to the @entity81 , which supports @entity14 's case			2
it says ancient @entity4 rites stipulate that the body be cremated by means of a wood - fueled fire in an open - air facility exposed to daylight			1
" we want equality , not exceptions , " @entity14 states on the web site for his charity , the @entity91			0
" no one expects @entity9 to marry in a church , so why are @entity4 funerals shoehorned through @entity97 designed like @entity99 churches ? " allowing open - air cremations in @entity5 would also save @entity4 families money , @entity14 says			1
many @entity5 hindus still prefer the traditional funeral pyre ritual and choose to ship bodies to @entity31 for a proper ceremony , which can cost up to $ 5,000			0
doing it in @entity5 would cost about a quarter of that amount , @entity14 says			1
@entity5 's @entity109 has acknowledged @entity14 's case but does n't offer much hope for his appeal			2
" there are inevitably competing views on the appropriate arrangements for disposing of bodies stemming from different views about religion , morals and decency , " it said in a recent statement			0
" there 's no plan to change the law on cremation			0

@entity14 , 70 , argued the practice is already legal under @entity5 law
opponents say it is unsanitary and hazardous to health and the environment
