-- as you might expect from a city that has districts called @entity5 and @entity6 , there 's no shortage of hearty @entity9 and @entity10 cuisine in @entity11 , but the city 's elaborate mix of immigrants has also resulted in some fascinating culinary fusions			1
the real deal : @entity17 at @entity18			1
" @entity20 " cooking mixes elements of traditional @entity10 cookery with modern techniques and an emphasis on fresh produce , while the style known as " @entity27 " revisits classic recipes from all over @entity29 , using choicer cuts of meats , healthier ingredients and an added an @entity34 sensibility			2
there 's nothing " nuevo " about @entity18 ( 3555 @entity37 ) , which , in spite of the @entity40 allusions of its name , serves reassuringly traditional @entity9 dishes			1
this @entity5 institution specializes in cheap hearty staples like " moros " ( black beans and rice ) and " vaca frita " ( shredded fried beef with a garlic seasoning ) , but the real draw is people - watching in the heart of the @entity9 exile community , as the émigrés reminisce about the old country			1
the @entity18 bakery next door does great empanadas , fruit juices and @entity9 coffee , which is an entirely different beast from the regular @entity34 filter variety			1
café cubano , or " cafecito , " is like a sweet espresso and is served in tiny , potent shots			1
add a splash of steamed milk to get a delicious " cortadito			0
" outside @entity5 , @entity72 ( 1058 @entity73 ) in @entity74 knows how to whip up a mean " café con leche			1
" as with so many things in @entity11 , when it comes to fine dining , @entity74 is the place to be			1
if you like to eat in the company of the glitterati and you 've got the bank balance to back you up , take your meat - loving self to @entity85 ( 112 @entity86 )			1
it may be just a steakhouse , but this is the kind of steakhouse favored by a-list celebs			2
a filet mignon will set you back $ 52 , and you 'll love all 12 juicy ounces of it , while a dessert of @entity95 is diet - wreckingly good			0
do you agree with our @entity11 picks ? or have we missed out your favorite spot ? tell us in the sound - off box beow			1
elsewhere in @entity74 , @entity101 is home to some very chic eateries , many of which get away with charging ridiculous prices for very ordinary fare			0
fortunately , there 's @entity107 ( 600 @entity101 ) , with its seafood - based fusion of @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 cuisine			2
think sashimi flavored with exotic fruits and you 'll be on the right track			0
kind of ... for sushi of the more traditional kind , try @entity120 at the @entity122 hotel ( 1901 @entity73 , @entity123 ) , which also does excellent tempura and teriyaki			0
@entity126 ( 11 @entity127 ) is another @entity74 favorite			0
@entity129 's does n't take reservations and there are huge queues for its legendary crab , but if you 've got better things to do than queue for two hours for your supper , you can always grab a takeout from the counter next door			0
if you want to impress that special someone , there 's nowhere better than @entity144 ( 1700 @entity145 )			0
this secluded , romantic hideaway has superb @entity148 food and is suitably expensive			0
vegetarians are well catered for at the @entity150 ( 185 nw 36th street ) in the @entity152 neighborhood , a relaxed but stylish option for breakfast , lunch and dinner			2
@entity157 ( 959 @entity158 , @entity123 ) is another good spot for veggies , or anyone with a hankering for a deliciously healthy smoothie			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
@entity164 : where to stay what to see where to be seen where to eat where to shop			0
