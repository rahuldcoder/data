-- a blue moon is rising			0
while its rival stumbled at the final furlong , @entity2 held its nerve and claimed the three points which it so badly craved			1
a 4 - 0 victory over @entity8 -- a win which helped take its goal tally to 100 in this season 's @entity11 , came following a frustrating first half in which the visiting side held firm			1
in the end , it was @entity18 who finally made the breakthrough , scoring twice in eight minutes to settle the nerves before further strikes from @entity22 and @entity23 sealed the win			1
city will now go into sunday 's final home with @entity27 with its destiny firmly its own hands			1
a draw will be sufficient to win the title -- but a defeat would allow @entity33 to snatch the crown should it overcome @entity35 at @entity36			1
" it was very difficult , " @entity2 defender @entity37 told @entity38			1
" if you do n't score early , sometimes it can be hard , but the key was we worked hard , we found space and we stayed patient			0
" it was a very solid performance , nothing is won yet but it was very important to win here tonight			0
" it was a massive step forward but there is still one game to play			0
@entity27 has nothing to play for but they have some very good players and can score goals			2
" the spirit is great here , the players work very hard , we kept the belief when we were in third place and now we are here			0
we have a great chance and hopefully on sunday we can celebrate the title			2
" the margin of victory against @entity8 would scarcely have been imaginable at halftime with @entity8 proving stubborn in defense			2
@entity2 , which dominated the opening 45 minutes , failed to find a way past a resolute visiting side			2
having watched @entity33 slip up at @entity68 , where it contrived to throw away a three - goal lead , it would have been understandable for @entity2 's frustration to surface			1
instead , it stepped up a gear and when @entity18 fired home @entity37 's cross from close - range , the shackles were released			1
the @entity77 tapped home a second when @entity78 failed to hold @entity80 's effort and @entity22 added a third with a minute of normal time remaining			2
there was still time for @entity23 to rampage through the midfield and beat @entity78 to notch his side 's fourth and @entity2 's 100th of the season			0
" we played good football in the first half , they did n't have any chances but the manager said just to be calm and we would get what we wanted , " added @entity18			0
" when the team defends with 10 players in the box , it 's always about the first goal			0
once we got it , gaps opened up and we scored more			0
" @entity102 's men will now prepare for @entity27 with the title within touching distance			1
elsewhere , @entity105 confirmed its place in next season 's @entity11 with a 2 - 0 win over @entity109			1
@entity110 and @entity111 secured the points for @entity105 , which had looked doomed only weeks ago			0
the result means @entity114 requires a last - day miracle to survive relegation .			0
