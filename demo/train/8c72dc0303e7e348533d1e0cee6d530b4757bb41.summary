like @entity0 and @entity1 , @entity2 will run for president in 2016 as a grandparent			1
this seemingly unremarkable fact has triggered a spasm of media self - analysis : is @entity8 the victim of a sexist double standard ? it 's a question that has been -- and will be -- asked often			1
we keep asking , because we refuse to see the plain answer			0
@entity2 is not the victim of a double standard			1
she is the beneficiary of a double standard			2
if elected in 2016 , @entity2 will be the second oldest president in @entity17 history , after @entity18			1
at age 69 , will she be too old ? that was a question people felt free to discuss when @entity1 ran for president			1
@entity23 reported on june 15 , 2008 : " listen to some @entity24 , and you 'll think the 71 - year - old @entity27 senator is a man lost in a perpetual fog			2
he is ' confused ' and has ' lost his bearings ' or is ' out of touch			0
' " the " lost his bearings " innuendo was used by candidate @entity33 himself , in a may 2008 interview with @entity36			0
nor was age deemed an inappropriate question in earlier elections			2
@entity23 reported : " roughly one - third of respondents in most recent national polls say that @entity1 's age could impede his ability to effectively govern the nation			1
... approximately one - third of voters expressed similar concerns about @entity48 's age in 1996 and @entity18 's age in 1984			1
( @entity48 was 73 years old in 1996			0
@entity18 was 73 in 1984			0
) ... ( @entity51 ) lder voters tend to worry more about the age issue than other voters			0
" yet a question that commentators generally agreed was relevant in 1984 , 1996 and 2008 is a question that @entity2 supporters now deem insulting , offensive and unfair to women			1
in a roundup of the question , @entity60 found room for the following quote : " both men and women face age discrimination , but it 's no secret that , for women , ageism mixes easily with sexism			1
... and obsessing over a woman 's year of birth is often a slightly more respectable substitute for the latter			0
" in a headline , the liberal website salon likewise dismissed the issue of @entity8 's age as " sexist			1
" the column underneath rationalized why : " putting an age limit ( even a pundit - prescribed one ) on the presidency will have a disparate impact on female candidates , given that most are older than their male counterparts when they start their political careers			2
" in other words : as between @entity2 on the one hand , and @entity1 or @entity48 on the other , the same standard is a double standard			1
the same method applies to the discussion of @entity2 's marriage			1
the @entity8 camp 's view seems to be : when it 's helpful to @entity2 , her marriage is urgently relevant ; when that marriage might be politically harmful , it 's sexist and insulting to mention it			1
when @entity2 sought the @entity24 nomination in 2008 , she argued that her tenure as first lady ought to qualify as a bona fide job credential			2
she told @entity107 in march of that year : " i represented our government and our country in more than 80 countries , and i know that people are nitpicking and that 's fair -- it 's in a campaign			0
but compare my experience , even after the nitpicking , with @entity118 ( @entity33 ) @entity33 's			0
i mean , let 's look at this objectively here , and i think my experience is much more preparatory for the job that awaits			0
" yet when @entity124 likely candidate @entity123 suggested that @entity2 ought to be held to account for some of the scandals of her husband 's administration , @entity8 went into outrage mode			1
the influential columnist @entity130 ( @entity132 / @entity131 ) chuckled , " @entity123 's waving of the @entity135 flag has been dismissed by pundits on the right and left as odd and irrelevant			0
... " but the truth is just the opposite of what @entity8 and her team would like remembered			2
while the first lady contributed comparatively little to the foreign and economic record of the @entity147 years , she was arguably the central mastermind of the @entity8 presidency 's scandal management			1
a 2007 biography revealed that it was @entity2 's team that hired the private investigators assigned to " destroy " former @entity8 mistress @entity153 when that matter went public in 1992			1
new papers from the @entity8 library depict @entity2 pioneering the attack on @entity158 as a " narcissistic loony tune			1
" ( until it became clear that @entity158 would not cooperate with prosecutors , the imputation that @entity158 was a crazy , untrustworthy stalker would serve as the @entity165 's first line of defense against the 1998 sex scandal			0
) @entity2 's most trusted aide , @entity168 , led a campaign of vendetta against journalists and politicians who got crosswise with the @entity173 , including , notably , @entity174 of the @entity175			1
there 's no particular reason to expect a @entity2 presidency to restore the economic growth record of the 1990s			2
@entity2 's foreign policy achievements are nebulous and doubtful , as she herself has had to acknowledge			1
but the one thing we can feel most sure of about a second @entity184 is that it will revert to the scorched earth politics of personal destruction that @entity2 field - marshaled 20 years ago -- and that the @entity33 campaign warned @entity24 against in 2008			2
( one of the ironies of a @entity2 presidency will be to watch @entity124 belatedly discover @entity33 's scandal - free personal integrity			1
) @entity2 asks two things of us			2
on the one hand , she wants to be judged exactly as we 'd judge a similarly accomplished man in politics			0
on the other hand , she wants us always to remember that the hopes of all womankind are fixed on whether she personally gets the job she wants			0
as she said on the night she conceded the 2008 @entity24 nomination to @entity33 : " although we were not able to shatter that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time , thanks to you it has 18 million cracks in it , and the light is shining through like never before , filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time , and we are going to keep working to make it so , today keep with me and stand for me , we still have so much to do together , we made history , and lets make some more			0
" " keep with me			0
" " stand for me			0
" @entity2 did not end her drive for the nomination with a message of hope and inspiration for some future female nominee			2
she ended it with a reprise of @entity221 's , " i shall return			0
" @entity222 captured exactly this version of gender justice in a classic 2008 " @entity226 " sketch : " i need to say something			0
i did n't want a woman to be president			0
i wanted to be president and i just happen to be a woman			0
" in that one highly specific sense , then , the @entity2 standard is always single : whatever it takes .			2

some have said raising topic of @entity2 's age is sexist
if @entity8 runs and wins in 2016 , she would be the second - oldest president
@entity242 : @entity8 says she wants to be judged by same standard as men
he says if @entity8 is held to same standard , age question is entirely appropriate
