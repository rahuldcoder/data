@entity0 , @entity1 -- since his recent @entity6 homecoming , the long - lost son has been baptized , a good @entity3 gave him an airline ticket and now he 's counting down the hours until saturday morning -- when he will see his mother for the first time in 35 years			1
@entity10 , 37 , made national headlines when he tried to cross the @entity6 border illegally from @entity13 three weeks ago -- only to remember upon arrest by the @entity6 @entity15 that he was actually a @entity6 citizen born in @entity16 and maybe , just maybe , his birth certificate and his mother could be found to prove it			1
the @entity15 did find both , and now mother @entity19 will travel saturday from @entity20 to @entity0 , @entity1 , to see and embrace her son for the first time since he was 2 years old			1
the reunion will be made more dramatic by how the son speaks only @entity25 and the mother knows only @entity27			1
@entity10 has been staying in the care of a @entity0 church since the @entity15 released him this month			1
" they did n't believe me , " @entity10 said of the @entity15 when they arrested him october 30			1
in fact , they thought he and a @entity13 man were both coyotes -- or smugglers -- guiding six @entity37 nationals across a putrid flood - control channel along the @entity13 border at @entity40 , @entity1 , said @entity42 agents			2
" they would tell me , no , that i was @entity13 , " @entity10 said			1
" i had to tell them the truth or they were going to send me to jail			0
" it 's a family saga that spans 1,800 miles of separation , lasting more than three decades			0
but in some ways , it 's only now that the mother - son relationship is really beginning			1
at one point , the mother nearly lost all hope of ever seeing her son again , unable to establish contact with him in central @entity13			1
conflicting stories from mother and father it begins about 35 years ago when @entity10 's father , estranged from his wife , took the boy from @entity16 to @entity64 , @entity13 , to live with grandparents			1
his mother wrote letters to the grandparents ' home but they were never acknowledged			0
so the mother , now 60 , never knew of her son 's whereabouts for certain , she said			1
his parents later divorced , and his father told him a version of events that conflicts with the mother 's account			2
" my dad told me that my mom had abandoned me at an orphanage center because she did n't love me , " @entity10 told @entity2			1
" he dropped me off with my grandparents and went back to @entity16			0
he almost never spent time with me			0
" but his mother said her estranged husband took the boy from the care of her sister on what seemed like a routine outing			1
the family was living in a neighborhood near @entity16 's @entity92 , and when the boy was n't returned home promptly , the estranged husband told his wife that he had taken the boy to @entity13 for a monthlong visit			1
but the month became a year , and a year became decades			0
@entity19 begged her estranged husband to return the son back to the @entity6 , but it did n't happen , she said			1
@entity19 said her son was taken away when he was about 2 years old , but @entity10 remembers being 3 years old at the time			1
perhaps they will better determine the exact time during their long - awaited reunion			2
the couple divorced in 1986 , but did n't settle on child custody in the divorce , @entity19 said			0
so police were unable to help her , she said			0
she could n't find him on social media because she did n't know he was using her maiden name as part of his full name -- a common practice in @entity117 countries			0
@entity19 went on to have four other children and moved to @entity20 , where she now lives in @entity119 working as an assistant housekeeper at a hotel			0
the ex-husband could n't reached for comment by @entity2			0
@entity10 was the only child his parents had together , and for now , he is withholding judgment on which parent 's account to believe			2
while @entity19 does n't maintain contact with her ex-husband , @entity10 has been in touch with his father			2
the son will make up his mind on his parents ' conflicting stories when he 's able to talk with them side - by - side , he said			0
in the meantime , he 's enjoying his stay in @entity0 so much that he 's planning on making his home there -- after reuniting with his mother in @entity0 and then returning with her and her @entity143 © to @entity20 for a visit there , he said			1
a drummer who played with a band in @entity13 , @entity10 said he likes @entity0 's proximity to @entity13 and its cultural atmosphere			1
moreover , he 's taken a liking to a local church pastor , @entity151 , who has helped @entity152 with food and shelter since the @entity15 released him			2
@entity19 was recently baptized at the church			0
we give him a warm bath			0
he had n't taken a shower in 10 days			0
he was dirty , and we clothed him , " @entity151 said			0
' i know what it feels to miss a mother ' polite and attentive to visiting journalists , @entity10 appreciates how his odyssey from @entity13 to the @entity6 had a fortunate conclusion			1
bandits earlier robbed him of his money and cell phone , leaving him with just his clothes on his back , he said			0
he did n't even have any identification when the @entity6 @entity15 arrested him , he said			1
during his years in @entity64 , @entity10 married and had two children			2
but he 's now divorced , and his two children live with their mother in @entity176			0
two years ago , he moved to @entity177 , @entity13 , he said			2
once he settles in @entity0 , he 's thinking of inviting his two children to visit him -- and possibly his ex-wife , " but i ca n't force her , " he said			2
he will be spending his first @entity180 as a repatriated @entity117 with his mother in her @entity20 home , where she lives with two of her children , both in their 20s			0
his airline ticket to @entity20 was given as a gift by a stranger , @entity188 , who heard of @entity10 's story in the media			2
" i immigrated here in ' 77 , so i saw my mother 12 times , and anyway she passed away this year , when i was over there " in @entity194 , @entity188 said , choking up			0
" so i know what it feels to miss a mother -- and he never enjoyed -- so you know i said with my son , ' let 's do it ! ' " he said , his sentences broken up by overwhelming emotion			2
@entity188 just happened to visit and give @entity152 the ticket while @entity2 was interviewing him .			0
