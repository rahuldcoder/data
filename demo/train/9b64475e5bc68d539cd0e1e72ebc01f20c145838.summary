-- touch technology has come a long way in the last decade			2
just six years ago , most phones used traditional keypads ; today , almost all smartphones have a touchscreen , and the technology has spread to tablets , handheld consoles and laptops as well			0
one thing still lacking in touchscreens , though , is any kind of sensory feedback ; you can not feel the keypad on your @entity17 , nor the action buttons when you play a game on your @entity21 tablet			1
you ca n't feel the icons on your home screen , or the texture of your photos			0
over the next decade all this looks set to change with the emergence of new tactile or " haptic " devices			0
one new technology announced this month by the research wing of the @entity33 allows users to feel textures on a touchscreen , pointing to a future where you will be able to use your phone not only to see and hear , but also to feel			1
@entity40 , the @entity41 at @entity33 's @entity42 , told @entity0 that in his view the future will see " touch screens on mobile devices , tablets , laptops , tables and walls			0
everything will be touch - sensitive in the future and we need tactile feedback to make it more useful and usable			1
" as well as making screens you can feel , @entity56 is also developing tactile equipment that does n't require any actual contact at all -- like an @entity61 , but where you feel as though you can touch objects in front of you in thin air			1
the device is called the " @entity71 " and in its developers ' words it provides " interactive tactile experiences in free air			2
" the @entity71 works by blowing small rings of air at a user to simulate touch , movement or collisions with objects			2
students at the @entity79 in @entity80 are working on a similar project called @entity82 , which gives the same sense of mid-air feeling through ultrasound vibrations rather than pulses of air			1
according to its inventors , @entity82 deploys " ultrasonic transducers " to produce a variety of different sensations on the skin -- basically using sound waves to simulate touch			0
@entity40 says @entity82 is an interesting idea that , in his view , points to the future of touch devices : " i love this work -- ( it is ) very well done			0
in general creating tactile feedback in free air is a very important research direction			1
" other products under development use tactile feedback in completely different ways			1
a new sound device called the @entity107 aims to immerse users in sound by using low frequency vibrations to create the physical sensation of bass -- rather like being in a loud cinema or standing in front of a speaker at a rock concert			0
the @entity117 takes a different approach to bringing feeling to a touchscreen by creating real , physical buttons that emerge from the screen to emulate a physical keyboard			0
another new invention , the @entity125 , aims to provide physical feedback to help visually impaired people navigate by " feeling " the objects around them			2
the device attaches to the wrist and uses ultrasound to scan the immediate area , delivering soft pressure to the user 's wrist as they get close to objects			2
if these inventions go into production , then @entity40 's projected future of tactile devices begins to look so close ... you could almost touch it			1

researchers are working on allowing you to ' feel ' objects in mid-air
@entity56 uses *bursts* of air , @entity156 students *experimenting* with ultrasound
new touchscreens also offer tactile feedback
inventions point to a future where you can feel technology in new ways
