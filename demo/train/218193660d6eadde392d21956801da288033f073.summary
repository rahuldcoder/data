conversations about refereeing controversies in the @entity2 have run amok this week			1
sunday 's disputed , last - second field goal by the @entity4 that gave them a 31 - 30 win over the @entity7 first set tongues wagging			2
but that uproar was comfortably outdone the next night by an even more controversial , game - winning score -- this one by the @entity12 , which resulted in their narrowly defeating the @entity14			0
this play -- both the lack of a blatant offensive pass interference call and officials ' determination that @entity21 's @entity20 deserved a touchdown , despite evidence indicating the ball was intercepted -- spurred vitriol on @entity26 and criticism from pundits and fans alike			2
for many , it illustrated the credibility problem plaguing the league during its season 's first three weeks with replacement officials on the field , in place of regular referees who were locked out by the @entity2 in a prolonged contract dispute			1
this storm subsided late wednesday , when @entity2 commissioner @entity40 temporarily lifted the lockout to allow the " regular " referees to officiate thursday 's game between the @entity43 and @entity4			1
@entity2 officials remain locked out until a new collective bargaining agreement is voted on by the union membership			1
about time , ' players , fans say as @entity2 officials return @entity40 has had his critics , including those up in arms over the league 's handling of the latest officiating issues			1
but it is worth pointing out that the sport has at times been a trailblazer in the field of technology , making soccer -- or football as it 's known outside the @entity63 -- look like it is still stuck in the dark ages			1
the @entity2 introduced an instant replay system in 1986 , allowing officials to review and possibly overturn calls on the field			1
this system at first did n't take and was scrapped , but an improved replay system was reintroduced in 1999			0
since then , instant replay has been a key feature of the sport , with coaches allowed to challenge a call			0
each time , play is halted while the on - field referee watches a replay of the disputed incident from the sidelines and makes his final call			0
in all , two challenges are allowed per side per game -- the limited number is to ensure games do n't totally lose their flow or get too long -- and an additional challenge is permitted if the first two are proved correct			0
in the final two minutes of each half , no coach challenges are allowed , but an additional official , watching from overhead in the press box , can intercede over any controversial decisions			0
as seen this week , the instant replay system is n't foolproof			0
but problems about officiating decisions have , in the past decade or so , become increasingly reduced now that there 's an avenue for calls to be overturned			1
this has not been the case , however , in soccer			2
" the @entity2 embraced technology early on , and it 's much more progressive than other sports , even in @entity63 , like baseball , " said @entity106 , a commentator on both sports for @entity109 broadcasters @entity110 and the @entity111 , as well as @entity112			1
" with better camera angles and social media with armchair referees , there 's more pressure than ever for the officials to get it right , so it 's logical to embrace and adapt the technology , " he added			1
@entity2 's stop - start nature lends itself better to such a system , whereas in soccer there has been a reluctance to introduce technology because of fears it could break up the game 's flow			1
resistance has been voiced by the likes of @entity136 president @entity135 who , in an interview this week , once again professed his dislike for goal line technology			1
" you will never convince me on technology , and i will not change at the age of 57 , " said @entity135 , a @entity140			2
" technology assisting referee , i say ' no '			2
my idea is to help referees by putting up more referees			0
" such a system has been tried in the @entity150 since 2009 and was used at the recent @entity152 tournament			0
but mistakes were still made			0
notably @entity157 's " goal " for @entity158 against @entity7 , which looked to have crossed the line , would have been allowed had technology been in place			1
it was an incident at the @entity161 that finally convinced world governing body @entity163 and , more specifically , president @entity164 , of the need for change			0
a shot from @entity7 's @entity168 -- which was comfortably inside the @entity170 goal line -- was not ruled a goal			1
ultimately , the @entity109 fell by a 4 - 1 score			0
" i have to say , ' thank you , @entity168 ' , " said @entity164 at the time			0
" i was completely down in @entity174 -- when i saw that it really shocked me			0
it took me a day to react			0
" the lack of goal line technology in soccer is hard for @entity106 ' @entity63 colleagues and friends to comprehend			1
" the lack of technology was the overriding issue ( some @entity63 ) had with regards to the @entity186 , " said @entity106			2
" they 're just astonished there 's not a review , that it 's just unprofessional and illogical			0
" navigating injury : can gps help reduce player burnout ? if the beast that is soccer has taken its time to crank into life over the use of technology , other sports like cricket and tennis have been solid bedfellows with the @entity2 in providing help to umpires and officials			1
in all those sports , the @entity2 included , there were skeptics when technology was introduced			1
" there 's always been a fear that it makes a game more stop - and - start , " said @entity106 , arguing that in each case instant replay has made sports better			2
" the drama of a challenge in the @entity2 is incredible			1
it creates a great buzz for all the spectators			0
" i 'd love to see it come into ( soccer )			2
the good would far outweigh the bad and in a few weeks of it being introduced everyone will be thinking why did n't we have this before			0
" the @entity227 is among those planning to use goal line technology next season , a decision that has been welcomed by the vast majority of the league , including @entity235 manager @entity234			1
" we see every season , every big tournament , we need it because there are some crucial moments within those games where you could find the right solution with a bit of technology , " said the @entity235 boss			2
there is a parallel between soccer and the @entity2 in the way players , coaches and fans have a tendency to berate officials , as has been seen in abundance in the @entity63 this week			1
@entity7 quarterback @entity256 stepped in to ease the row over the controversial ruling in his game this week , when the @entity4 ' field goal attempt soared toward the uprights -- and through them , according to the officials in the field , if not to @entity7 fans			1
when asked whether the field goal had or had not gone through , he said : " from the angle that i have , i ca n't tell			2
those guys are standing at the uprights			0
so , if they ca n't get it right , then nobody can			0
" that throws up the question of further technology			2
had cameras been in place on the goalposts then the matter would not even have been a talking point this week			0
as an aside , @entity63 comedian @entity279 has a stand - up routine in which he suggests posts rise up to 500 feet in the air to avoid any issue			0
on a serious note , that is a potential issue for @entity40 and the @entity2 commission to address , and one that @entity106 believes they will			1
" it 's such a forward - thinking sport in terms of technology that after what happened , i would n't be surprised if that matter is already being addressed , " said @entity106			2
for now , though , @entity40 has more instant and pressing matters to contend with .			0

the @entity2 has used officiating technology on and off for the last 26 years
soccer has never *implemented* technology , instead using extra officials
calls for goal line technology in soccer have grown as a result of *costly* errors
sports such as tennis , cricket and rugby already use technology *successfully*
