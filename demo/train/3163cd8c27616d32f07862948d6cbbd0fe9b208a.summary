the piece contained a wisdom tooth , and @entity13 's had been removed before her 2005 disappearance , @entity1 solicitor general @entity10 told reporters			1
" right there and then , it was obvious it was n't @entity19 , " @entity10 said			0

the bone was found by an @entity26 tourist near the @entity27 , a resort on the western side of the island , @entity1 prosecutor @entity23 said			1
@entity10 said the news was " another tragedy " for @entity13 's family , since it brought them no closer to learning what happened to their daughter			1
@entity13 was 18 when she was last seen on the island			1
" it 's very sad for the parents to not have closure , " @entity10 said in a later interview			2
" they must rest assured we are working hard to solve the case			0
whether that will be in the near future , i can not tell			0
" @entity13 's father , @entity7 , thanked well - wishers soon after the announcement			1
" we remain hopeful that some day we will find the answer to the whereabouts of our daughter , @entity7 , " he said			0
" again , we want to thank everyone for their support in our efforts to find justice			0
we ask that you continue to remember @entity19 in your thoughts and prayers			0
" @entity13 's mother , @entity13 , did not immediately comment on the case , but her attorney released a statement that said she accepts the outcome			1
" @entity13 accepts the forensic conclusions , is emotionally exhausted from the inexplicably long wait , and deeply disappointed in the time and manner in which she learned of the results , " said attorney @entity67			1
investigators tested the bone at the @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity77			2
their job was first to determine whether it was a human or animal bone and then -- if it proved to be human -- figure out to whom it belonged			2
@entity23 said the bone was initially examined by a forensic expert in @entity1 , who determined it was from a young woman			2
but @entity10 said the bone appeared to have been in the water " for a very long time , " and it was not possible to determine whether it came from a male or a female			2
police collected a second bone monday that had been found this month on the beach by a @entity96 family , but that one turned out to be an animal rib bone , prosecutors said			2
@entity13 was visiting the island with about 100 classmates to celebrate their graduation from @entity102 in suburban @entity103 , @entity9 , when she disappeared			2
she was last seen in the early hours of may 30 , 2005 , leaving an @entity0 nightclub with @entity105 and two other men			0

a surveillance camera captured images of the two entering the room			0
@entity105 , 23 , also faces federal wire fraud and extortion charges in the @entity26 , where prosecutors say he demanded more than $ 250,000 from @entity13 's family in return for disclosing the location of her body			1
he told @entity111 investigators that he knows where her remains can be found , but would neither identify the location nor say what happened to her on the night of her disappearance , a @entity111 police official told @entity2 in june			0
@entity10 said van der @entity105 remains a " person of interest " to investigators , and @entity1 prosecutors have asked the @entity137 -- which currently has the hard drive from van der @entity105 's computer -- for any information that may be relevant to @entity13 's disappearance			1
but @entity1 authorities have no plans to interview him again any time soon , @entity10 said			0
" he has made so many statements before that have proven untrustworthy that we will not just rush to him to see about this statement , " @entity10 said			0
@entity2 's @entity151 and @entity152 , @entity154 's @entity153 and @entity156 's @entity155 and @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
