-- @entity1 drove away a top of the range @entity4 sports car for the third straight year in @entity6 after battling back to beat @entity7 in the final sunday			1
@entity1 may need to build a bigger garage at home to house the prize gifts from the sponsor of the @entity15 premier @entity13 event , but it 's a nice problem to have for the four - time grand slam champion , who is returning to her best form after recovering from a recurrent shoulder injury			1
" i had quite a slow beginning to the year , but me and my team have been working hard to get in the position to win titles again , and i 'm so happy to be able to do it in @entity6 , " the @entity21 told the official @entity15 website			1
but in a battle of former world number one 's , @entity1 was taken all the way by @entity7 , who led by a set and 3 - 1 and looked set to take the keys of the @entity4 herself			1
but @entity1 reeled off 11 of the last 13 games of the match on the red clay to win 3 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 1 in two hours three minutes			1
it was the 30th career title for the two - time defending champion and an important boost ahead of the @entity40 in @entity41 next month			0
" for the first half of the match i thought it might not be my day today , but somehow i turned it around , " she added			0

" in the second set she definitely went for those big shots and she made some amazing points			0
she 's just a great player , and that 's what happens when you play against great players in big matches like this			0
you need to use your opportunities , " she said			0
@entity1 , who is a brand ambassador for the sponsor , took match point with her 34th winner and was clearly delighted to continue her dominance at the @entity66 event			2
" it 's been an incredible few years at this tournament , " she said			2
on the @entity71 , @entity70 's @entity69 wrapped up the @entity72 with a 6 - 2 6 - 2 win over @entity74 of @entity75 in the final			1
@entity69 was always on top as he won his second title of the year and fifth of his burgeoning career			1
he hit 19 winners to leave @entity74 with few opportunities to show his best in a one - sided match			0
the tournament was notable for the shock defeat of world number one @entity87 in the quarterfinals to @entity89 , who was in turn beaten by @entity74 in the last four			2
rising young star @entity91 took the @entity93 title in @entity94 with a 7 - 6 6 - 1 win over @entity96 in the final			0
