-- july 14 , 2011 download a @entity2 map related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 transcript this is a @entity8			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity12 , @entity13 : that airplane means it 's time for a new summer edition of @entity0 ! hi , everyone			1
and this week , we 're focusing on connections ; specifically , @entity22 ! career connections : recruiter @entity25 : that 's the name of a segment we debuted this past school year			1
the goal of @entity22 is to give you guys a look at some of the different jobs around @entity0			1
but first , we want to look at jobs in general			1
you definitely want to take notes for this ! @entity40 is here to give us some career advice from a recruiter 's perspective			1
hi , @entity40 , thank you so much for joining us ! @entity44 , professional recruiter , @entity46 , @entity47 : thanks for having me			1
@entity25 : first question : what exactly does a recruiter do ? @entity44 : a recruiter basically has the role of finding qualified and talented employees for a company			1
@entity25 : can you share with our audience , which is a middle and high school audience , a few dos and some don'ts on how to put together a resume ? @entity44 : sure			2
i would say in terms of dos , first of all , pick a very simple format			2
you do n't have to get elaborate ; you do n't want to use a lot of different fonts or colors or fancy items on your resume			2
you want somebody to be able to view it very quickly and to understand what your skills and your qualifications are			2
and secondly , in terms of the content , i would say really think about what are the qualities and qualifications that you have			2
certainly you can list job duties that you 've had at previous companies , but you also want to think outside the box in terms of accomplishments as well			2
did you solve a particular problem ? did you win an award ? were you on a particular dean 's list or things like that ? try to think about other accomplishments that you can encompass , and then also other involvement that you 've had outside of the work world as well			1
so , think about volunteer organizations that you 've been a part of			2
and then also , certainly , any technical systems or software , things like that , that you may know how to use , even if you 've used it in your personal space and not professionally			2
if it 's a skill that you have , you should include that on your resume			1
@entity25 : ok , my last question : speaking to that middle or high school student , what tips and tricks maybe you can provide for them to get ahead of the competition ? @entity44 : i would say for them to get ahead of the competition , to really get involved either in their school , in organizations or on their campuses when they go off to college			1
one of the things that our company looks for for our interns is people who are really passionate about what we do , but have also put that in to practice in any way that they can			2
so , if they want to be a publicist , they 're on the pr committee for their student organization , or their sorority or whatever it may be			2
they 're not just going to classes			2
they 're doing more and taking more time to get exposure in any way that they can , even in their extracurricular activities			2
@entity145 @entity25 : do n't put away that pen and paper yet ! a few @entity0 professionals also have some great advice to share			1
they talked about their jobs in @entity22 segments last school year			2
if you missed those reports , go to @entity154 to check them out			2
in the meantime , here 's what those employees had to say about how to get a jump start on your career			1
( begin video ) @entity163 , @entity0 video journalist : it 's definitely ok not knowing exactly what you want to do and saying " this is what i want to be in ten years			1
" the best part is the journey there allows you to experience and try different things until you find what really works for you			0
@entity176 , @entity0 production assistant : the advice that i would give is if your school has a broadcasting program , make sure you are in that program			1
find out what your passion is , because whenever you find out something that you really feel strongly about and you have a good background in it , whatever you decide to do it wo n't feel like work			0
it will just feel like something that you 're doing for fun because you 're interested in it			0
@entity192 , @entity193 producer : one of the best pieces of advice i was given is treat every job like you 're running for political office			1
that does n't mean go shake hands and kiss babies and all that kind of stuff			0
it just means get your name out there , let people know you 're interested and pursue it , and do n't stop			0
@entity209 , @entity0 executive producer : being proactive , i think , in any field is the way to go , and having ideas and not being afraid to speak out and being confident in yourself			1
you should n't get discouraged by if someone gives you some sort of criticism or critique or feedback			0
you just have to know that you believe in yourself and you 've done your best			0
@entity221 , @entity222 / reporter : you have to have passion in everything you do			0
does n't matter if it 's at work or at home or at school , you have to have passion			1
you have to come with energy and excitement			0
@entity233 , because there is another person willing to take it from you if you do n't keep pushing forward			0
@entity237 , which is it does n't all come at the beginning			0
it takes time , actually , to get where you want to be			0
it does n't happen overnight			0
and positioning , so every day you wake up you 've got to think about how you can better yourself for tomorrow			0
@entity244 , @entity245 : a lesson to everybody , whether you 're a journalist or any other type of career , is be willing to take risks			1
because if you 're truly passionate about it , follow your passion and success will follow			0
it will pay off in the end			0
( @entity257 ) blog report @entity25 : so , are you connecting with any specific career yet ? we asked you guys that question on our blog last year			1
some of you may have changed your minds , and that 's okay			1
but here 's what a few of you had to say then			1
@entity269 said she wants to be a second grade teacher			0
she says it 's easy for her to learn about this career			1
all she has to do is observe her current teachers			0
@entity274 dreams of becoming an archeologist so he can make important discoveries			0
on the other hand , @entity277 said he wants to be a kid a little longer and do the stuff as a kid he wo n't do as an adult			0
he said sometimes you have to slow down			0
@entity283 and @entity284 have something in common : they both want to be veterinarians when they get older			0
and @entity288 believes that no matter how young you are , it is never a bad idea to give some thought to your possible profession			0
he says in these economic times , good jobs are hard to find			0
@entity296 @entity25 : some of you might be spending your summer working			1
well , whether you 're interning with a company or just plain old having fun , we want you to tell us about it ! there are two ways you can do it : write on our blog or send in a video			0
you have to at least be 13 to do that			0
you can do both at @entity154			0
