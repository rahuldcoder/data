@entity2 threatened tuesday to nullify the armistice agreement that ended the @entity4 in 1953 , citing @entity6 - led international moves to impose new sanctions against it over its recent nuclear test , the @entity1 's official news agency @entity0 reported			1
@entity12 's military said it will also cut off direct phone links with @entity14 at the inter-korean border village of @entity16 , @entity0 added			1
@entity17 : how worried should we be about @entity2 's nuclear test ? @entity1 have technically been at war for decades			1
the 1950 - 53 civil war ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty			0
this is not the first time @entity12 's rhetoric has written off the armistice			1
in the aftermath of a previous nuclear test in 2009 , it said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because @entity14 was joining a @entity6 - led anti-proliferation plan			1
the @entity1 's latest threat comes amid new international efforts to clamp down on its weapons program			0
a draft @entity6 resolution to authorize more sanctions against @entity12 in response to its controversial nuclear test was formally introduced tuesday at the @entity44 by @entity6 ambassador @entity45			1
a senior @entity47 administration official earlier told @entity48 that the @entity6 and @entity49 , a key @entity2 ally , had reached a tentative deal on the wording of the proposed resolution			2
the two nations had been negotiating for weeks on the question			0
according to a @entity44 diplomat familiar with the negotiations , the draft resolution contains sanctions targeting specific technology known to be used for uranium enrichment			1
these new sanctions go beyond those contained in existing resolutions			0
the draft sanctions resolution also includes restrictions on a list of luxury goods such as jewelry , yachts , luxury automobiles and racing cars , according to the diplomat			2
these are specifically singling out the interests of the regime 's ruling elite			0
some luxury goods had already been banned by a @entity44 resolution prompted by @entity2 's first nuclear test in 2006			1
for the first time , the @entity44 would be pressuring @entity2 diplomatic personnel , calling for vigilance on diplomats engaged in illicit activities such as moving large amounts of cash across borders			2
the draft sanctions resolution would aim to stop @entity2 officials using diplomatic pouches to bring money back to @entity2 , according to the person familiar with the negotiations			1
a vote on the resolution is expected later this week			0
the diplomat said the @entity6 and @entity49 are satisfied with the text and see it as balanced and appropriate			0
the members of the @entity44 may make minor technical changes , but no major changes to the resolution are expected			2
' @entity102 moves ' there has been major concern in recent years among world powers about @entity2 's nuclear aspirations			1
timeline : @entity2 's rocket - fueled obsession @entity12 continues to make " belligerent and reckless moves that threaten the region , their neighbors and now , directly , the @entity6 , " @entity6 secretary of state @entity113 said in a @entity48 interview tuesday			1
" it 's very easy for @entity116 to prove his good intent here also			0
just do n't fire the next missile			0
do n't have the next test			0
just say you 're ready to talk , " said @entity113 , speaking on the last full day of his first international trip as the nation 's top diplomat			1
@entity116 is @entity2 's leader			1
addressing reporters later in @entity126 , @entity113 again put the onus on @entity116 to act , saying , " the @entity6 people and the world " would like to see him " take responsible actions " for peace			2
" rather than threaten to abrogate and threaten to move in some new direction , the world would be better served " if @entity116 tried to engage in legitimate dialogue , @entity113 said			2
" our preference is not to brandish threats to each other			0
it 's to get to the table " to negotiate , he said			0
as a permanent member of the @entity44 with veto power , @entity49 can strongly influence the body 's decisions and has previously resisted strong sanctions on the @entity116 regime , which it props up economically			2
the two communist countries have been close allies since @entity49 supported the @entity1 with materiel and troops in the @entity4			0
the @entity6 backed the @entity14 in the conflict , fighting side by side with its troops			2
in pictures : rare glimpse inside @entity2 analysts say @entity158 wants to maintain the @entity1 as a buffer between its border and @entity14 , a @entity6 ally			1
@entity158 's government on tuesday said it strives for a " nuclear free peninsula			0
" it repeated its support for the @entity44 's condemnation of @entity2 's nuclear tests but also called for a muted response to it			1
' paying the price ' @entity170 , director of the non-proliferation and @entity172 at the @entity174 - based @entity173 , told @entity48 that while the resolution will probably not be too onerous , the fact that @entity49 went along with another @entity44 sanctions measure against @entity2 reflects the growing anger and disillusionment that @entity158 feels toward its supposed ally			2
" @entity116 is now paying the price for going ahead with a nuclear test despite @entity49 warnings not to create trouble during the political transition that has been under way in @entity158 the past year , " @entity181 said			0
" the real question , though , is the degree to which @entity49 will be willing to implement the @entity44 sanctions and to impose punishment of its own			0
" a sharp drop in @entity49 grain sales to @entity2 in january may be a sign that @entity49 's support for @entity44 sanctions is more than just a symbolic punishment			2
" @entity181 characterized @entity2 's reported threat to nullify the 1953 armistice as " largely bluster , " pointing out that the country has " broken the armistice many times , most recently in 2010 by sinking a @entity14 corvette and shelling a @entity14 - populated island			1
" but , he added , " the threat does point to more trouble to come from the recalcitrant hermit kingdom			0
things are going to get worse before they get better			0
" military exercises @entity12 said the underground nuclear blast it conducted on february 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller , lighter device , suggesting advances in its weapons program			2
it was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since its young leader inherited power in december 2011 after the death of his father , @entity223 , who made building up @entity2 's military strength the focus of his 17 - year rule			1
like the regime 's previous tests in 2006 and 2009 , the move prompted widespread international condemnation , as well as a promise of tough action at the @entity233			0
a @entity235 response to @entity2 's latest challenge @entity2 's government regularly rails against sanctions imposed on it			1
the staging this week of joint @entity6 - @entity14 military exercises , known as @entity241 , has added to the simmering tensions , @entity0 reported monday			0
it described the training exercises as " an open declaration of a war " in the face of repeated warnings from the @entity1 that they should not be held			0
the exercises have " touched off the pent - up resentment of the service personnel and people of ( @entity2 ) and compelled them to harden their pledge to take thousand-fold retaliation against the enemies , " the news agency said			0
but the @entity14 military warned wednesday that it would respond strongly to any attack from its northern neighbor			1
" if @entity2 goes ahead with provocations and threatens the lives and safety of @entity14 , our military will strongly and sternly retaliate against the command and its supporting forces , " maj. gen. @entity259 , a senior official at the @entity260 , said at a news conference , according to the semiofficial news agency @entity262			1
@entity116 said @entity14 notified the @entity269 that the drills with the @entity6 " are defensive in nature			1
