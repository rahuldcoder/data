-- @entity2 's @entity1 , @entity3 , may appear to run on a different clock than the rest of the world -- unless you happen to glance at those 24 timepieces lining the west wall of the island 's @entity12 departure lobby in three neat rows			1
then , for however many seconds you wish to suspend your whole notion of time , it 's the exact same hour , minute and second everywhere on the planet			1
and according to several other location - specific clocks straying from the usual @entity31 - @entity30 - @entity29 scheme			2
" when you look at these clocks it 's a little bit odd , " says @entity32 , a @entity3 - based architect , farmer and the creator of " @entity35 for @entity36 , " an international art exhibit that aims to dispel , however momentarily , the whole divided ( and delusive ) notion of multiple times around the globe			1
inspired by @entity44 ... and @entity45 launched at @entity47 's @entity46 , the exhibit was conceived by @entity32 while working as a college professor in @entity50			1
" it was 1999 , shortly before the millennium change , and i was fascinated by that whole @entity45 furor going on , " recalls @entity32			0
" it led me into researching what time is really all about and how -- as @entity44 poignantly put it -- time is ' man 's most pervasive illusion			1
' " the world 's time zones , notes @entity32 , are " currently based on political borders and outdated views of travel , commerce and communications			1
divisions that are often illogical			0
" to address the point , the architect designed an alternative artistic model of a single , shared 24 - hour cycle worldwide , which " challenges us to relax our preconceived notions of structures that are contrived and artificial			2
in @entity32 's model , time would be re-calibrated biannually on the equinoxes ( fall and spring )			1
leap year adjustments would be replaced by a brief semi-annual time stoppage ( about three hours ) , a " free time " recess dedicated to a worldwide celebration of humanity and relationships			2
can you imagine that ? could @entity89 even imagine that ? @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 represented the overall effect of 24 oddly labeled clocks evoking universal time " can be unsettling for some -- even threatening , " says @entity32			2
in fact , the curious clocks of @entity3 serve to achieve the opposite			1
" we are a planet that is joined in the beat of a single heartbeat , " says @entity32			0
" and that heartbeat is best appreciated when it 's recognized and celebrated			2
" travelers glancing at the distinctive @entity12 clocks , installed more than a decade ago ( the installation is on long - term loan to the @entity12 , says @entity32 , but is n't necessarily permanent ) have plenty to get their time - addled heads around before their flight departs			1
there are no numbers on the clocks , which are divided into 24 - hour faces instead of twelve , with each clock displaying the exact same time in perfect sync			1
then there are the 24 locations labeled below each clock -- selected from 24 separate 15 - degree segments of the @entity122 's surface , and all associated with important historical events			1
not your typical wall clock reference points			0
@entity129 is written in @entity130			0
@entity135 speakers will wonder where the clock labeled @entity137 ( @entity138 ) refers to -- which is just the point			0
some references should be obvious enough ( @entity141 )			0
others , like @entity143 ( @entity144 ? ) or @entity145 ( hint : @entity147 ) or @entity148 may require personal interpretation or the services of @entity151			0
which is also the point			0
" the inspiration for independent research is an important part of this mission , " notes @entity32			0
" the viewer 's participation is critical			0
" a world without leap year in a world as troubled and triumphant as this one , sliced into manufactured time zones that accentuate distance over connection , the presence of 24 perfectly synchronized world clocks beating as one in a small @entity165 airport might , at the very least , give travelers a moment 's pause			1
and beyond that ? are there fans of @entity32 's suggestion to just stop time for three hours in the spring and fall ? " i do n't think anyone takes it that seriously as a proposal , " says @entity32 with a laugh			2
" but there are certainly fans of the art installation who take the notion of stopping to celebrate humanity quite seriously			0
" personally , " he adds , " i think it would be a big improvement over @entity189			0

@entity3 's @entity12 is home to a unique *collection* of world clocks
each clock shows the time in locations with historic significance
the installation is brainchild of a former university professor and current architect
