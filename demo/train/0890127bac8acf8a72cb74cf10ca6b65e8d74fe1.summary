-- a second former @entity3 police officer pleaded guilty thursday in connection with police shootings of civilians on a @entity8 bridge in the days following @entity9 , authorities said			1
@entity11 , a former police detective who now works as a special agent for @entity13 , pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge that he failed to report a cover - up in the investigation of the @entity18 in @entity3 , the @entity10 said in a statement thursday			1
@entity11 also admitted he helped compile a false report on the incidents , and was with others when they planted a gun as part of the cover - up , according to court documents			1
last month , former police lt. @entity26 pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice in connection with the cover - up			1
two civilians were killed and four others wounded in the shootings on september 4 , 2005 , six days after @entity9 slammed into the @entity34			0

" the police maintained that they fired at the civilians in self - defense , after the civilian fired at police , " the statement said			2

today , defendant @entity11 admitted that he also knew of and participated in a conspiracy to obstruct justice in the investigation of the shooting			1
" @entity11 faces a sentence of up to three years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine when he is sentenced june 10 , and @entity26 faces up to five years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine at his may 26 sentencing			1
@entity67 , @entity68 attorney for the @entity69 , said that while @entity11 's conviction is the second in the case , " this officer was the first to enter into an agreement with the @entity68 and provide cooperation			1
" @entity11 learned from a @entity3 police supervisor , identified in court documents as " the investigator , " that an officer had " shot an innocent man " on the bridge , prosecutors said in the @entity10 statement , citing the documents			1
upon hearing that comment , @entity11 determined it was a " bad shoot , " meaning it was not legally justified , authorities said			1
" @entity11 admitted that he participated with his supervisors in the creation of a report that included false statements by the officers involved in the shooting ; false claims about a gun that had in fact been planted by the investigator ; and fabricated statements from witnesses who did not really exist , " prosecutors said			1
" @entity11 also admitted that the report of the @entity103 investigation included false statements alleged to have been given by two of the victims of the police shooting			1
" according court documents , @entity11 said the report of the incident indicated the investigator had returned to the bridge the day after the shooting and found a gun in the grass below the scene of one shooting			1
but @entity11 said that story was " a lie			1
" he told authorities that after the shooting , he and two sergeants drove with the investigator to the investigator 's home , where the investigator retrieved a bag from his garage			0
asked what was in the bag , the investigator said , " a ham sandwich , " according to the documents			0
" @entity11 then looked in the bag and saw a gun that would be used in the @entity103 investigation , " prosecutors said in the statement			2
" once the investigator assured @entity11 and the sergeants that the gun was ' clean , ' meaning it could not be traced to another crime , they all went along with the plan to plant the gun			2
" at the time of @entity26 's guilty plea , authorities suggested that other indictments would follow			1
however , an information was filed in @entity11 's case , showing he was not indicted			2
informations can be filed when a defendant waives indictment by a grand jury , according to the federal courts ' web site			0
the shootings occurred after several officers , responding to a call for assistance , drove to the bridge and encountered six civilians who were walking across it to get food and supplies , according to the indictment filed in @entity26 's case			2
the officers fired , killing @entity37 , and then traveled to the other side of the bridge , where @entity41 was shot			0
@entity41 was shot seven times -- five times in the back , the coroner said			0
his brother , @entity170 , was arrested on suspicion of eight counts of attempted murder of a police officer and held for weeks before his release , according to the indictment			0
state prosecutors pursued criminal charges against several police officers without success			0
in august 2008 , a judge quashed indictments against @entity183			0
@entity184 and @entity18 , officer @entity18 and former officer @entity185 , all of whom were facing first - degree murder and attempted murder charges			0
in addition , the judge threw out attempted first - degree murder charges against officers @entity193 and @entity195 , and attempted second - degree murder charges against officer @entity197			0
federal prosecutors opened an investigation after the judge 's actions			0
legal scholars have said that while more might be indicted , it 's unclear whether any other officers will be charged in the shootings			0
" there 's no evidence the officers shot out of malice , " @entity206 , a professor at @entity208 ' @entity207 , said last month			0
" it was probably negligence , ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover - up			0
