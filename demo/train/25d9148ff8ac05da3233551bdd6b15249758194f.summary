@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the mobile phone version of the " @entity5 " video game , the torches hanging along the dark walls of @entity9 glow in an eerily realistic fashion			1
@entity1 is known for its strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor			1
" we invented the technology , it 's called ' dynamic lighting ' , " said @entity14 , general manager of @entity1 's mobile phone branch of @entity16 , the world 's biggest video game publisher			1
@entity1 programmers , such as @entity14 's team , are among the most sought - after in the world as large international it companies turn to the east @entity28 country to take advantage of strong computing and language skills coupled with cheap labor			1
its computer literacy is not without its dark side -- the country has an unenviable reputation as a hotbed for computer fraud and a large community of hackers			2
but legitimate it is one of @entity1 's fastest growing export sectors with turnover of about 1 billion euros ( $ 1.38 billion )			1
roughly 90 percent of some 1,000 it companies in @entity1 are foreign - owned and the government hopes exports will reach 1 billion euros in the next couple of years			1
in february , @entity48 opened a @entity50 technical support center in @entity0			1
the investment followed , among others , the launch of a development center by @entity55 in the university town of @entity57 in 2005			2
that is the online retailer 's only software development hub in @entity60 besides one in @entity62 's @entity61			2
other centers are located in @entity64 , the @entity65 and @entity66			2
" @entity1 programmers are exceptionally creative			1
and in games , you need to explore , " said @entity14			2
prospects for large cash inflows from the @entity74 after @entity1 joined the bloc this january , cut - rate taxes and low wages add to @entity1 's appeal			1
" in @entity60 , @entity1 is appreciated as having the biggest growth potential together with @entity80 and @entity81 , " said @entity77 , head of @entity78 in @entity1			1
the software maker , which has a support and software development center in @entity1 , has doubled its local staff to 1,000 over the last year since opening a tower office in central @entity0			1
it plans to hire an additional 500 employees			0
" the geographical distance , the similar time zone and business mentality argue for us to develop our activities in a country where costs are also lower , " @entity77 said			0
@entity1 's low wages of around $ 600 a month compare with $ 1,050 in @entity96 and $ 950 in the @entity97			1
both countries also attract hefty investment in the it sector			0
however , some see a risk the sector is overheating			0
double - digit wage growth and a shortage of skilled labor is dampening the enthusiasm of some investors and @entity1 is struggling with emigration as workers leave for better pay			1
" the battle for specialists is very intense , " said @entity112 , head of human resources firm @entity113 & @entity114			0
" there are n't enough of them , especially as many emigrated			0
" industry observers say this state of affairs has prompted companies to focus on building support or software development centers , which need cheaper and lower skilled labor , rather than hiring high - end programmers			1
" @entity1 remains good for outsourcing but not for first - class software authors , " said @entity126 , sales and marketing manager at @entity128 , a @entity1 company that sold @entity128 technology to @entity50 in 2003			1
" the brains are already with companies that have good salaries and it is costly to buy them			0
a good senior programmer can earn 2,000 euros gross a month			0
plus a 30 percent raise to buy him , and you have a salary of a good programmer in @entity141			0
" @entity143 data show @entity1 may be the biggest single source of online auction fraud in the world , a multi-million dollar industry that scams people using web sites like @entity150			1
" it 's highly organized			0
they create fake accounts to trick people into thinking they are insured , " said @entity151 , @entity143 representative in @entity1			2
" if @entity1 were stopped , the amount of online fraud would drop significantly			2
" experts say some 70 percent of software used in @entity1 is pirated , and salesmen still visit office buildings in central @entity0 to sell pirated cds and dvds			1
some hackers hope their skills will help secure employment , although breaking into other people 's networks for fame or as part of a job @entity171 has its dangers			2
" the @entity1 hacking community is quite large			2
they see the computer as a ticket out of the country			0
it is the easiest way to get a better - paid job abroad , " said @entity178			0
he faces a potential 54 - year jail term if convicted on charges of hacking into @entity65 government computers , including @entity184			0
he was indicted in 2006			0
