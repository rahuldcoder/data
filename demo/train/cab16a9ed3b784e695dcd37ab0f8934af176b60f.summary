@entity0 -- top @entity3 and @entity4 leaders called thursday for @entity6 's president to step down , significantly ratcheting up international pressure against a regime that has been criticized for its harsh crackdown against anti-government protesters			1
" the future of @entity6 must be determined by its people , but president @entity15 is standing in their way , " president @entity11 said in a written statement			1
" we have consistently said that president @entity15 must lead a democratic transition or get out of the way			2
for the sake of the @entity6 people , the time has come for president @entity15 to step aside			1
" the leaders of @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , the @entity28 , and the @entity29 echoed @entity11 's demand			0
" our three countries believe that president @entity15 , who is resorting to brutal military force against his own people and who is responsible for the situation , has lost all legitimacy and can no longer claim to lead the country , " @entity28 prime minister @entity31 , @entity26 president @entity32 and @entity27 chancellor @entity33 said in a joint statement			2
" we call on him to face the reality of the complete rejection of his regime by the @entity6 people and to step aside in the best interests of @entity6 and the unity of its people			0
" @entity3 officials , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter , have said they expect similar calls for @entity15 to step down in coming days from other leaders			2
@entity3 authorities also imposed new economic sanctions against @entity55 thursday , freezing @entity6 government assets in the @entity3 , barring @entity3 from making new investments in that country and prohibiting any @entity3 transactions relating to @entity6 petroleum products , among other things			1
@entity3 secretary of state @entity62 said the @entity3 " will take steps to mitigate any unintended effects of the ( new ) sanctions on the @entity6 people			1
" " these actions strike at the heart of the regime , " @entity66 said , noting that the @entity3 expects other countries " will amplify the steps we are taking			0
" @entity6 president claims military operations have stopped within the @entity3 , some opposition republicans were quick to back @entity11 's decision			1
@entity78 majority leader @entity77 , @entity79 , called @entity6 " a proxy for @entity81 , a supporter of terror , and a threat to @entity3 interests and our allies in the region			1
" other republicans , however , argued @entity11 waited too long to call for @entity15 's removal			1
" @entity3 must show leadership on the world stage and work to move these developing nations toward modernity , " said former @entity92 gov. @entity91 , a leading @entity93 presidential contender			0
" this means using the bullhorn of the presidency and not remaining silent for too long while voices of freedom and dissent are under attack			0
" the @entity78 previously said @entity15 had " lost legitimacy , " but resisted calling explicitly for his ouster			0
senior administration officials stressed in a conference call with reporters thursday that they wanted to ensure international coordination and properly prepare a new round of sanctions before moving ahead with a call for @entity15 's removal			2
the new @entity3 sanctions " are very strong measures , " said @entity114 , @entity6 expert at the @entity115			1
" these are also unprecedented			0
we 've never targeted @entity6 energy before			0
it is the regime 's achilles ' heel			0
" @entity114 -- author of " in the @entity123 : an eyewitness account of @entity0 's @entity127 " -- said no one expects @entity15 " to tip over tomorrow , " but " these are devastating blows			0

oil and gas make up about a quarter of @entity6 's economy , according to the @entity134			1
senior @entity3 officials , diplomats and members of the @entity6 opposition have argued that the next several weeks will be critical in terms of isolating @entity15 , strengthening sanctions against the regime , and bolstering domestic opponents of the regime			1
@entity3 strategy on @entity6 from @entity146 playbook the campaign against @entity6 's leadership , involving intense diplomatic outreach by both @entity66 and @entity11 , has been based on the one the @entity3 used in @entity146 , where the @entity3 administration built international consensus for the @entity153 mission to protect civilians			1
but @entity3 and @entity4 authorities remain opposed to any military intervention in @entity6 -- a sharp contrast to their response to regime - sponsored violence in @entity146			1
" i do n't think anybody believes that is the desired course of action on @entity6 , " one senior administration official said thursday			0
@entity164 , @entity165 join calls for @entity6 to end violence several @entity168 countries with traditionally close ties to @entity6 , including @entity165 and @entity170 , have been consulted in recent weeks , according to senior administration officials			2
@entity173 panel : possible crimes against humanity in @entity6 meanwhile , the @entity176 will hold consultations on @entity6 on thursday , when council members are scheduled to be briefed by the organization 's high commissioner for human rights , @entity180			1
officials said @entity180 is expected to give a sober assessment of the situation , despite @entity15 's insistence to the @entity173 wednesday that military and police operations against anti-government protesters had stopped			2
a @entity173 fact - finding mission announced thursday it has found @entity6 guilty of multiple human rights violations , and indicated it may be time for the @entity191 to become involved			0
" the mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population , which may amount to crimes against humanity , " investigation staffers concluded in their report			0
@entity26 and other @entity4 countries are continuing to push for a @entity176 resolution condemning the @entity15 regime , but they are still facing stiff resistance from @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209			1
the @entity3 is pushing for special session on @entity6 at the @entity211 in @entity212 , @entity213 , as early as next week			2
diplomats say they hope @entity180 's briefing thursday will generate momentum for further action , including additional calls for @entity15 to step down over the coming days			0
