-- on the heels of reports that @entity3 is considering a creative restart on " @entity5 , " comes last night 's ratings : the comedy veteran fell to a series low while facing a repeat of @entity11 ' " @entity10 " in the 9 p.m. hour			1
what 's interesting is @entity11 trying out " @entity18 " in this slot for the first time on a non-holiday ( and a " 2 @entity17 " repeat at 9:30 p.m. )			2
after @entity11 launched its 8 p.m. comedy hour beachhead on thursdays , many wondered if it was phase 1 in a master plan to have a two - hour comedy block on tv 's most lucrative night for advertising			0
if thursday is any indication , there 's potential should @entity11 want to shake things up in the fall : " @entity10 " repeat ( 10.3 million viewers , 3.0 adult demo rating ) won its time slot , beating fellow comedy " @entity5 " ( 4.4 million , 2.1 ) , which fell 13 percent from its last original four weeks ago			1
" @entity10 " 9 p.m. repeat also performed stronger than its 8 p.m. repeat ( 2.8 in the demo ) , which you would expect given the higher audience levels in the hour			1
@entity11 ' repeat of " 2 @entity17 " ( 7.3 million , 2.1 ) also beat the finale of @entity3 's " @entity42 " ( 3.2 million , 1.5 )			1
another point of interest last night : week 2 of @entity47 's " scandal " ( 7.5 million , 2.1 ) went up slightly in the ratings , though with " @entity49 " ( 8.8 million , 2.9 ) higher and slightly overrunning into 10 p.m. , it 's too soon to say if this means the audience is a real sign of an uptrend			2
" missing " ( 1.4 ) dropped a tenth			0
oh , and lest i forget , there was also last night 's highest - rated show : @entity60 's " @entity59 " ( 15.3 million , 4.2 ) climbed 8 percent to win the night			2
" touch " ( 8.2 million , 2.3 ) was steady			0
