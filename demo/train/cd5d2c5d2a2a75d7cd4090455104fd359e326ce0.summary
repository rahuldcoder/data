last week , a 22 - year - old @entity1 journalist was gang - raped in @entity2 and had to undergo surgery for severe injuries			1
the assault reminds us yet again of an often overlooked aspect of the @entity9 revolution			2
when @entity9 overthrew their dictator in 2011 , one of the first celebratory acts in @entity2 included the gang beating and sexual assault of @entity16 journalist @entity15 , who , like the @entity1 journalist , landed in the hospital			1
the @entity20 rape has always been portrayed as another unfortunate byproduct of mob violence			0
in fact , it was much more than that			0
it was a warning shot fired by men whose political beliefs are founded on a common pillar : women must stay out of the public square			2
one of the hallmarks of revolutionary victory in @entity2 has always been rape and sexual harassment			2
mobs of men routinely set upon women , isolating , stripping and groping			0
no one is ever arrested or held accountable , and elected officials shrug their shoulders and blame the victims			0
vigilante groups have been organized to track the incidents			0
@entity45 , one of the groups , recorded 46 cases of sexual assaults and harassment against women on sunday night alone -- and has added 17 more to its list that the group said happened monday			0
@entity9 women are the primary victims of sexual violence , and ultimately they are the intended recipients of the message : stay home , your input in government and politics is not wanted			1
opinion : why @entity9 protestors welcome the support of the army raping foreign journalists -- guaranteed to attract global attention -- is merely a more efficient way of getting that message across			1
when @entity9 overthrew the dictator , the @entity70 took advantage of public hatred of the dictator to ally him with @entity76 progressive ideals , including gender equality			1
out went the nongovernmental organizations that worked to make divorce easier and inheritance laws fairer			0
in came the thugs who stripped and beat women in the streets			0
granted , some of these crimes against women were committed by the military and the police themselves , as women like @entity91 ( a journalist whose arms were broken by soldiers ) and @entity95 ( a young protester who sued the government , accusing an army doctor of submitting her to a forced " virginity test " ) have reported			2
@entity100 , an @entity9 journalist , reported that the men who raped the @entity1 journalist last week called themselves " revolutionists			1
" that label should surprise no one			0
if one fervently believes women should stay inside their homes and out of the business of public life , what better way to accomplish that than rampant sexual harassment and sexual assault in a country in which women 's virginity and honor is the sine qua non of female participation in society ? not long ago , @entity9 @entity124 preacher @entity123 said that women protesting in @entity2 " have no shame and want to be raped			1
" the public face of the @entity70 would never espouse such a statement			2
but its founding intellectual lights never hid the fact that a pillar of their planned theocracy was keeping women powerless			0
and their record in office is one of sexist exclusion			0
women held only eight seats out of 498 ( four of the eight women were from the @entity70 party ) in the disbanded @entity145			1
women made up 7 % of the constitutional assembly that drafted the @entity9 constitution			1
no wonder then that the document ( approved by referendum in december 2012 ) refers to women only as sisters and mothers , and only within the framework of family -- not employment or public life , even though a majority of @entity9 women work			1
@entity9 has always been a place where life for women is nasty and brutish , if not short			1
last year , a @entity165 survey showed 91 % of @entity9 women between the ages of 15 - 49 said they had to undergo female genital mutilation			1
the @entity169 in may reported that 99.3 % of @entity9 women interviewed said they had been subjected to some form of sexual violence			1
rape victims almost never go to the hospital and certainly not the police			0
there are no medical protocols for rape , and police treat female victims as prostitutes			2
whether or not that violence is political is worthy of discussion			0
at the moment , no one even debates it			0
it is the elephant in the room			0
as the @entity9 revolution enters another chapter , and more women get stripped and sexually assaulted in the streets while being systematically excluded from the halls of power in @entity197 , it is high time for @entity16 progressives and other @entity201 commentators to stop separating anti-female violence from the politics of the @entity70 's revolutionaries			1
in the broadest sense , the @entity206 's response to the treatment of women in @entity210 countries , from @entity9 to @entity211 , says a lot about the status of women here			2
we might not be able to do anything to stop violent , organized misogyny in far - off lands , but we can certainly stand up for our own principles and call it what it is .			2

@entity1 journalist , 22 , was gang - raped in @entity2 and hospitalized for surgery
@entity228 : this is just one of scores of *vicious* rapes and beatings of female protesters
@entity9 women are primary victims , she says . the message is : stay home
she says @entity70 misogyny , *attitude* rapes are *justified* , *infects* society
