-- @entity2 's @entity1 dramatically revived his @entity3 hopes with a stunning victory on an epic 18th stage which finished at the summit of the imposing @entity7			1
at 2,645 meters , it was the highest - ever stage finish on the @entity3 , and @entity9 's @entity1 certainly hit the heights with a brave solo victory			1
he broke clear of a group of favorites on the @entity14 with 60km remaining , reeling in the fragmented remains of a breakaway , before crossing the line alone over two minutes clear of his chasers			0
@entity1 , written off after muted performances in the @entity21 and the first stage in the @entity23 , said he had decided to take his courage in his hands			2
" i do n't want to finish fourth in @entity27 , and i said to myself ' i 'm going to risk everything , it 'll work or it 'll fail ' , " he told @entity26			0
" that 's the way i am , i 'm not afraid of losing			0
and if my legs were hurting out in front i knew the others would be hurting to catch me up			0
" but he failed by 15 seconds to take the yellow off the shoulders of @entity37 hope @entity35 , who again performed heroics to take fifth on a stage which effectively marked the end of @entity42 's chances of retaining his crown			1
the three - time winner from @entity45 struggled on the upper slopes of the galibier and now trails @entity35 by four minutes 44 seconds in seventh place			2
to complete a superb day for the @entity50 , @entity1 's brother @entity49 took second on the stage to move up to third overall , one minute eight seconds down			1
he gained precious time on @entity54 's @entity53 , who slipped to fourth at one minute 12 seconds			0
friday 's 19th stage , the third in the @entity23 , could well hold the key to the eventual winner with the finish on the famous @entity60 after another climb on the @entity7			1
both the @entity50 will be looking to pick up further time on @entity53 , who is a stronger time trialist , ahead of saturday 's individual test against the clock over 42.5km in @entity66 .			0

@entity1 wins 18th stage of the @entity3 on @entity7
@entity1 closes to within 15 seconds of race leader @entity35 of @entity37
@entity1 's brother takes second on the stage to *improve* to third overall
