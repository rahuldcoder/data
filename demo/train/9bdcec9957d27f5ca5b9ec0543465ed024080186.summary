-- it 's been almost 20 years since the first " @entity2 " debuted in 1995 , but the franchise is still going strong			1
on thursday , @entity5 chairman and ceo @entity4 revealed that " @entity2 4 " is coming in june 2017 to the delight of pretty much everyone -- well , except those still grieving from " @entity10			1
" ( our hearts seriously may never recover			1
) but everyone else ? totally losing their minds			2
yeah , we know you 're excited			2
but as this fan perfectly summed up the news , we 've still got a looooong way to go until june 2017			2
so let 's take a trip down memory lane and revisit the movie that started it all , shall we ? here are five things you may not know about 1995 's " @entity2 " : 1			1
it all goes back to a short called " @entity28 " in 1988 , @entity29 created a short film using computer animation called " @entity28 , " which told the story of a little toy soldier who was horrified by the babbling baby eager to play with him			1
with that @entity36 - winning short , @entity29 's @entity35 first started playing with " this notion of a juxtaposition with the audience , " as @entity35 puts it in the documentary " the making of @entity2			1
" " it 's where you can show them something that they are so familiar with , and all of a sudden you can make them look at something from a different point of view , " he explains			2
" like , looking at a cute little baby from a toy 's perspective			2
from a toy , that ( baby 's ) a monster ! we were inspired from ' @entity28 ' with the ideas we developed there of toys being alive			2
" @entity29 then played around with the idea of the " @entity28 , " @entity62 , being one of two stars of a toy - focused buddy movie			1
but when the animation studio landed on the idea of the movie being set in a kid 's bedroom , where one new toy would come to join the older ones , it did n't quite add up that a kid would be that excited about such a simple plaything			1
@entity75 was originally called " @entity76 " the action hero @entity75 is essentially a mashup of all of the @entity29 team 's favorite toys , and he was initially named " @entity76			2
" ( the team also tried out something like " tempest from @entity84			2
" ) @entity85 also was n't the only actor under consideration for the part			1
in 2001 , @entity89 admitted that he too had been offered the role			0
" it 's the only regret i have in the business of something i passed on , " @entity89 said			0
as for @entity94 , brought to life by @entity96 , that was inspired by @entity35 's @entity99 toy , which also had that old - fashioned pull - string			0
" @entity2 " was n't supposed to be the movie 's title " @entity2 " was supposed to just be the working title for the project , and not what it was supposed to be called when it arrived in theaters			1
back in 2011 , " @entity10 " director @entity107 turned to @entity108 to reveal some of the options that were floating around back in the ' 90s			0
( @entity107 served as an editor on the first " @entity2			1
" ) some of the options were pretty straightforward , titles like " made in @entity114 " " moving buddies " and " @entity116			0
" and then there were some really creative ones , from " @entity119 " to " @entity120			0
" we 're kind of a fan of the potential title " to @entity125 and @entity126 , " though			0
the movie almost did n't happen according to @entity128 , november 19 , 1993 was a dark day for @entity29 's creative team			1
that was when the studio presented a collection of story reels to @entity5 , whose animation chief was not at all into it			0
among the complaints was that action figure astronaut @entity75 and quaint cowboy @entity94 were just unlikable and had awkward chemistry			0
( in the words of @entity139 , " the original @entity94 was a thundering a * * * * * *			1
'' ) to fix it , @entity29 re-examined their two starring characters -- and listened more closely to the voices behind them			0
" we originally thought @entity75 was a heroic kind of super space hero @entity147 who always does the big gesture , " said producer @entity144			0
" but that was a setup for a big fall			0
we listened to @entity85 ( @entity85 's ) recordings and wound up with a self - confident but modest space cop , a sgt. @entity155 who does his job every day			0
" and for @entity96 ' @entity94 , who originally was supposed to be the top toy who reigned over the bedroom from the top of the bed , @entity29 toned down some of the sarcasm and made him less of a dictator			0
" when we moved him down to the floor with the other toys who looked up to him as @entity170 's favorite , " @entity144 said , " he became one of the guys , more likable			0
the license plate number on @entity170 's mom 's minivan has a special meaning several @entity29 fans make it a game to watch for hidden messages in the company 's films , and the sequence " @entity183 " is one of them			1
according to @entity186 , that was the room number for a class @entity29 's @entity35 , @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity170 were all in at @entity190			0
you can spot that sequence on the license plate of the minivan driven by @entity170 's mom in " @entity2 , " " @entity196 " and " @entity10			1

the " @entity2 4 " *announcement* has *thrilled* fans
