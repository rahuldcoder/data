@entity0 , 17 , is your typical all - american boy			1
he spends his time studying , chilling with his school friends , and riding a unicycle			1
except @entity0 is living for a year in @entity5 with a @entity7 family			1
he 's part of the @entity10 program , which recently partnered with the ambitious " 100,000 @entity11 " that aims to strengthen often frosty @entity13 - @entity7 relations , one teenager at a time			1
the organization says it has already achieved its aim of having more than 100,000 @entity13 students in @entity7			1
however , the numbers of @entity13 students in @entity7 are dwarfed by the 235,500 @entity7 currently studying in @entity13			1
their ranks include @entity23 , 18 , who spent three years studying at a high school in @entity25			1
can @entity0 and @entity23 succeed where presidents and diplomats have failed and bridge the gap between the two superpowers ? here are their stories			1
@entity13 , @entity7 reach historic climate change deal @entity0 studies in @entity5 and lives with a @entity7 family			1
many of my @entity13 classmates thought it was insane to leave @entity13 and go to school for a year in @entity7			1
i 'm interested in foreign languages and cultures and @entity7 has always piqued my interest			1
the most surprising thing that i encountered here was the large number of people living , working , and moving around in @entity5			1
when i ride my unicycle , hordes of people stop what they are doing just to stare in amazement			1
it 's also helped me realize that in @entity5 the herd mentality is a very common thing			2
before arriving in @entity7 , i believed that many locals would be unwelcoming to foreigners like myself but that 's totally inaccurate			1
the @entity7 people i meet are always friendly and willing to help			1
on weekends , i go to @entity5 's numerous parks and chat with the local people			2
many of the elders love to explain the history of @entity7 and talk about their childhood , which allows me to understand the richness and nuances of @entity7 's culture			1
the language barrier has been the main challenge			2
in the beginning , there were only a few topics that i could comfortably speak about with my host parents			2
conversations were limited often out of fear that i would run out of words to say or i would not understand			2
i 've started to move out of my comfort zone and can speak about many different things such as @entity5 's pollution , traffic and divorce			2
living with a @entity7 family has been wonderful			1
i wake up in the morning and eat breakfast with them			2
they help me understand and navigate @entity7 culture			1
i consider and treat my host family as if they were my own family at home			2
and , i feel very fortunate in that that they treat me like their own son			2
my school back home is larger so i 'm unable to get to know every student and faculty member , but my school in @entity7 is much smaller			1
this also allows for the students and teachers to have a more personal relationship with each other			2
colorful economic summit ends with rare news conference in @entity5 @entity23 recently graduated after studying at a high school in @entity25 for three years			2
he will attend the @entity107 next year to study mathematics			1
i have been living with @entity110 family in a small @entity25 village called @entity112			2
my host parents are the sweetest couple and best parents i have met			0
without their help , i would not have fitted into life here so fast			0
my three host siblings have helped me a lot in both my academic and social life			0
at first , i thought it would be very hard for me to make friends among the high school students but within the first few weeks i was proved wrong			0
on the first day i arrived @entity125 , @entity124 ( my homestay sister and brother ) and @entity128 , one of their friends , took me to swim in a lake			0
everyone in the school is friendly and willing to help me with anything			0
i could n't believe that i used to think that the students were all mean			0
i made many friends through the soccer team , photography club and my classes			0
i think the most shocking thing to me is the togetherness of local community and my high school			0
i grew up in @entity5 and i never experienced country life and every family seems like a small part of a bigger family			0
i also did community service with my host siblings and friends			0
for example , we helped stack wood for our neighbor , and my school even has a fund raising day -- every student helped raise money for children in @entity160 to go to school			0
i think the idea of sharing and unity in this community really taught me something			0
i think @entity7 and the @entity13 have two complete different educational systems			1
each system has its own advantages and they both fit their own country			0
i chose to go to an @entity171 because i wanted to experience more -- i found the @entity13 education system to be more attractive to me			1
there are a lot of things that i would never have learned and experienced if i went to school in @entity5			0
my high school in the @entity13 offers many more diverse classes compared to schools in @entity7			1
i could choose any class i like such as drama and film analysis			0
students could even start a new course with a mentor			0
for example , i was interested in photography and i was able to do it in my high school with a professional photographer			0
i was also the editor of the school yearbook			0
i never thought that the knowledge i learned from school could be so diverse			0
i felt that i became a real member of the @entity195			0
we spent time together and we shared the housework			0
they treated me as one of their own			0
i am really thankful that i could have three unforgettable years in @entity25			0
24 hours with president @entity202 in @entity7			1

relations between the @entity13 and @entity7 are often tense
@entity206 hopes to thaw frosty ties by sending @entity13 teens to @entity7
more than 235,500 @entity7 study in the @entity13
can these " teen diplomats " succeed where presidents have failed ?
