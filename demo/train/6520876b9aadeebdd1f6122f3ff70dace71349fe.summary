-- has nothing been learned from " @entity2 ? " the recent @entity4 reboot of the classic crime drama featuring @entity6 in the role made famous by @entity8 in the late 1960s and early 1970s was one of the first of the fall television shows canceled			1
but do n't think that will stem the tide of reboots yet to come			1
get ready for new versions of " @entity20 , " " @entity22 , " " @entity23 " ( which will be updated to " @entity21 " ) , " @entity18 , " " lifestyles of the @entity16 and the @entity17			1
" and some of the former cast members of " @entity25 " have been saying they 've been approached about a possible reboot of the nighttime soap			1
so everyone should be excited that these popular shows will be getting new life , right ? wrong			0
@entity31 , one of the stars of the original " @entity22 , " tweeted " they really are running out of ideas in @entity35 " while her former co-star @entity36 tweeted " the thing about them doing a # charmed reboot is ... it just ... it feels like yesterday			1
" seems @entity41 and fellow former co-star @entity42 would rather see the series end up on the big screen than redone on tv			0
both recently tweeted in support of a " @entity22 " film			1
fall tv scorecard @entity35 has long loved a reboot			2
the movie industry appears to offer sequel after sequel to capitalize an an already existing fan base , so bringing back a beloved show would seem to make sense			2
but @entity57 's @entity56 points out that " for the most part , it 's the shows that do n't know why they exist -- other than having a connection to the past -- that falter			0
this is , unfortunately , all too common a problem			0
" " it 's hard to make a tv show a success , " she wrote			2
" that 's the thinking that often seems to be behind the idea of a reboot			2
but are reboots any help ? looking at their recent history , the answer may be a resounding no. " we have seen it with shows such as " @entity79 's , " " @entity80 , " " @entity81 , " " @entity82 , " " @entity83 " and " @entity84			2
" this season 's " @entity2 " was declared " worst new drama " by reviewer @entity87			0
as one @entity91 writer said , " sometimes viewers have such strong memories of an original that the new version can never compare			0
" " honing the ' spirit ' of a beloved show is difficult ; recapturing it is even more so , " writes @entity92 of @entity93			0
" there is no magic formula for creating television that resonates , especially when trying to appease preexisting fans			1
" sequel mania : a guide to the next five years of films not all of the redux retro shows , fail , however			0
@entity56 notes that sci - fi and fantasy genres seem to do well getting makeovers a la " @entity110 " and @entity111 has found success with the crime drama " @entity117 " @entity114 's " @entity118 " has also done well with audiences ( @entity114 is owned by @entity0 's parent company )			0
and for a little dash of irony , it was recently announced that -- just in time for the 20th anniversary of the series -- there will be a reboot of the cartoon show " reboot			1

there are several television reboots *planned*
