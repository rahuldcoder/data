-- with the tap of a toe or the blink of an eye , those with als are redefining what it means to be alive			1
i have to admit it took some time to come up with that line and believe it -- to have that kind of positive outlook on this nasty deadly disease and the future			1
just a year and a half ago , my mother , @entity17 , 69 , was healthy			1
our family 's matriarch , she was the one who was the life of the party , the trusted confidante but town crier of all family secrets , the glue that held my father , me , and my three siblings together			1
when i was told she had als i honestly did n't know what it was			1
but then my sister described it to me over the phone and i had to pull over the car			0
it 's a fatal , fast - moving neuromuscular disease that would paralyze my mother limb by limb			1
first robbing her of her ability to swallow , then speak , move and breathe			0
when that reality set in , i spent many nights in my home , crying on the floor			0
what enabled me to get up was that my mother accepted her fate with a strength and grace i 'd never seen before			2
when she began choking on her food , losing her ability to swallow , she got a feeding tube			0
when she lost her ability to walk , she got a motorized wheelchair			0
when she could no longer speak , she picked up a word board and started spelling out her conversations , still telling my father what to do			0
and finally when she lost her ability to breathe , she got a tracheotomy and ventilator to stay alive			0
which is why the notion of what it means to be alive , for me , has completely changed			2
i 've met people like former @entity68 @entity67 player @entity66 , who now , at age 36 , with @entity2 , is completely paralyzed			1
he uses eye - tracking technology to open doors , send e-mails , and tweet by blinking his eyes			2
i 've also met @entity74 , the founder of @entity76 gym equipment			0
the 53 - year - old @entity77 is running a corporation , communicating and raising millions of dollars for @entity2 research , by tapping with his toes			1
so you can see where i might get my inspiration in telling their stories			0
do n't get me wrong , i know it 's a devastating path to travel			2
someone described it to me as " imagining yourself , sitting in a chair , and being completely duct - taped head to toe , with only your eyes left open			1
that 's what it 's like to have @entity2			1
" it robs you of your physical abilities but it leaves your mind and spirit strong			0
it becomes all about your emotional connections to those you love			0
my mother smiles when she sees her grandchildren , her eyes light up when you walk in the door , she relaxes when the sun shines on her face			2
these days our family is just about hanging out			0
very little is known about how people get @entity2			1
in 90 % of cases it just happens out of the blue			0
it 's considered a rare disease , in part , because patients do n't live long enough to be counted			1
right now there is no cure			2
i hope by sharing my own experience , as well as that of others , we can learn more together			0
