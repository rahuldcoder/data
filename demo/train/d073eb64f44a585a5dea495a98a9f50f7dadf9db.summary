@entity0 -- a prominent @entity3 researcher sharply criticized a safety study by the manufacturer of the diabetes drug @entity7 on tuesday as an @entity3 panel weighed whether to yank the drug from the market			1
the study , dubbed record by @entity13 , came under attack throughout the first of two days of hearings by the 33 - member @entity3 advisory committee			2
" you ca n't trust it , and if we do trust it , we 're engaging in the willing suspension of disbelief , " said dr. @entity18 , the @entity3 scientist who first flagged deadly side effects of the painkiller @entity21			0
@entity18 's report followed a strongly worded @entity3 report last week that called the @entity12 study " inappropriate and biased			0
" it accused @entity13 of repeatedly submitting sloppy data and failing to follow up on reports of problems among patients , including deaths			1
but dr. @entity36 , @entity13 's vice president for clinical development , said the company 's studies " provide the most robust and reliable data " to assess @entity7 's safety -- and those studies have found " no evidence to suggest " the drug increases the risk of heart attack or stroke in its users			1
the @entity3 panel could vote wednesday on whether to remove the drug , which is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics , from the market			0
@entity13 says several trials have shown @entity7 is safe , but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study that linked ito the an increased risk of heart attacks and other related problems			1
published estimates indicate sales of @entity7 have dropped from about $ 3 billion in 2006 to about $ 1 billion			2
one of the committee members , dr. @entity60 , urged caution " before drawing any definitive conclusions " based on data he called " fragile			0
" that drew a blunt response from dr. @entity67 , the @entity68 cardiologist who authored the 2007 study and presented an updated , critical assessment of the drug tuesday			0
" whose fault is that ? " @entity67 asked			0
" we have a drug that has been on the market for 11 years			0
the company had every opportunity to do large - outcome trials , adequately powered and properly run , to answer this question			0
they did n't do it			0
" in a study published in june , @entity18 also found patients on @entity7 are more likely to suffer stroke , heart failure or premature death than patients who used another drug			2
and he said the @entity12 study would have been dismissed as " garbage " if it had been used to seek the drug 's original approval			1
" it would n't even be presented , " he said			0
and as the @entity3 panel prepared to meet , a @entity95 committee added to the controversy by releasing documents its leaders said show @entity13 " failed to publish studies that found serious health risks associated with @entity7 in a timely manner and actively promoted the drug despite the known safety concerns			1
" the documents , which the @entity106 provided to the @entity3 , include studies that date back to 2000 , the committee 's @entity109 chairman and ranking @entity111 said			0
" @entity112 have a right to know there are serious health risks associated with @entity7 and @entity13 had a responsibility to tell them			1
patients trust drug companies with their health and their lives and @entity13 abused that trust , " @entity119 sen. @entity118 , the committee 's chairman , said in a statement accompanying the documents			1
in february , the same committee released a report criticizing the @entity3 's handling of @entity7 and saying the @entity3 has been " too cozy " with drug makers			1
but in an e-mail , @entity13 spokeswoman @entity132 told @entity1 the new documents were " a small subset " of millions of pages the company released in connection with lawsuits over the drugs			1
" they include drafts and other documents taken out of context , which therefore are incomplete and misleading , " @entity141 said			2
" the documents do not offer new clinically relevant scientific information , and do not provide the full extent of @entity13 's studies and evaluation of @entity7			1
" @entity141 said the company " has been diligent in providing its safety data on @entity7 to the @entity3 " and publishing results in medical journals and online			2
@entity1 's @entity157 and dr. @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
