-- for all the heady talk about misleadingly " deific , " recently confirmed quantum specks named after @entity5 physicists , another kind of historic event just transpired : a record - shattering laser beam that , in a single shot fired on july 5 , 2012 , generated more power than the @entity11 does at any single instant			1
spooky or astonishing ? how about both			0
think of it as " extreme sports science , " a kind of lab - based game of automatic one - upmanship where researchers fiddle with incredibly complex , painstakingly calibrated machinery to produce unprecedented results -- then outdo them			0
time.com : 9 examples of improbable superhero technology that 's what the @entity28 -- home to the world 's largest laser -- just did when it pulled the trigger on 192 beams of optically amplified , electromagnetic radiation - emitting light , all fired within a few trillionths of a second of each other , to deliver 500 trillion watts ( or terawatts ) of " peak power " and 1.85 megajoules of ultraviolet laser light			1
framed in more eye - catching terms : the @entity28 says 500 terawatts outpaces the entire @entity11 for power used " at any instant in time , " and that 1.85 megajoules amounts to roughly 100 times what any other laser produces regularly			1
no wonder those two power unit prefixes ( tera , mega ) come from @entity51 words meaning " monster " and " great			2
" then again , what else would you expect from a laser housed in a building the size of three football fields , or a science lab with a word like " ignition " in its moniker ? the @entity28 , located in @entity63 , @entity64 , came online in march 2009 , and its goals are manifold : its primary mission , given funding by the @entity68 ( @entity68 ) -- " a semi-autonomous agency within the @entity11 @entity70 responsible for enhancing national security through the application of nuclear science to the nation 's national security enterprise " -- is to duplicate what happens in contemporary nuclear weapons , in part to render underground nuclear testing unnecessary			1
time.com : clamshell ! the story of the greatest computing form factor of all time but it 's also a repository for scientists -- the same sort that poke around at sub- sub-atomic levels for elemental quantum particles -- looking to understand " extreme states of matter that exist in the centers of planets , stars and other celestial objects			0
" and last but not least -- well beyond the holster - loaded conventions of mere pulp sci - fi skirmishing -- the @entity28 laser is about puzzling out something called " fusion ignition " : the point at which nuclear fusion reactions become self - sustaining , to , in the @entity28 's words , " provide abundant and sustainable clean energy			1
" fusion reaction is arguably the most exciting of the @entity28 's goals : to catalyze self - sustaining nuclear fusion , wherein two light atomic nuclei " fuse " together and produce a single heavier nucleus while converting some of that mass to incredible amounts of energy			1
that , in so many words , is how stars are born , and it 's something scientists have been working to achieve since the 1950s			0
the 500 - terawatt shot on july 5 brings scientists closer to solving a longstanding physics challenge and arguably the field 's holy grail : getting back more energy than you give			2
time.com : mission to @entity128 : 8 amazing tech tools aboard @entity131 's @entity130 " the 500 @entity137 shot is an extraordinary accomplishment by the @entity139 , creating unprecedented conditions in the laboratory that hitherto only existed deep in stellar interiors , " said @entity133 physicist dr. @entity132 in a statement on the @entity28 's site			2
" for scientists across the nation and the world who , like ourselves , are actively pursuing fundamental science under extreme conditions and the goal of laboratory fusion ignition , this is a remarkable and exciting achievement			0
" the july 5 shot was actually the @entity28 's third in a series of test fires , a series that 's seen power ramped up by nearly 100 terawatts since march 15 , when the @entity28 fired a shot that delivered 1.8 megajoules and peak power of 411 terawatts			1
and while electricity produced by sustained , controlled fusion reactions may not be commercially viable , well , ever , depending whom you talk to -- some say 30 to 40 years ; others say indefinitely given the technical challenges of putting star - stuff in a container -- the july 5 laser shot appears to be a major step forward			0
" @entity28 is becoming everything scientists planned when it was conceived over two decades ago , " said nif director @entity172 of the july 5 shot			2
in january 2012 , @entity172 predicted that fusion ignition would happen " in the next 6 - 18 months			0
" we 're getting close , in other words , to what you might call " the end of the beginning " of the very long -- and expensive : an experimental international fusion reactor being built in @entity181 is said to cost 16 billion euros , or nearly us $ 20 billion -- road to theoretically limitless energy generation			0
this article originally appeared on @entity0 : the laser beam 1,000 times more powerful than the @entity11			1

@entity28 laser generates more power in a single blast than the @entity11 does in any single instant
laser produces 1.85 megajoules of power , 100 times what any other laser emits
@entity28 experiments with nuclear energy to improve national security
laser experiments could give *insight* into sustainable clean energy
