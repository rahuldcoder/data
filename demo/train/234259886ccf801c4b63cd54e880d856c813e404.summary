-- all the world 's a stage for @entity3 , and we are merely players			1
she 's on the cover of six magazines and counting : people , @entity9 , @entity8 , ok , @entity7 and ok ! her wedding / divorce / possible reconciliation has dominated the cybersphere and @entity15 news shows : " @entity16 , " " @entity17 , " @entity18 , @entity19			1
this is bigger than the @entity21 and @entity22 rolled into one			0
@entity3 should not just have her own tv shows , she should have her own network : @entity26 , all @entity3 , all the time			1
and even though the news du jour focuses on her marriage ending , which by the very nature of a marriage means two people are involved , the media barely mention her soon - to - be ex-husband			0
he 's just a prop			0
he 's akin to " @entity38 's " @entity35 when @entity35 was cast as " @entity36 " simply because the ornate jacket fit			0
i 'll be honest , i 've been caught up a bit in the @entity3 marriage / divorce craze myself			1
i 've read more than my share of articles on the most documented 72 - day marriage in the history of the western world			0
i have to thank @entity3 and that guy she married for giving us a brief respite from the drumbeat of the often depressing , bile - inducing news			1
on some level , i truly wish that @entity3 's exploits could be our own only concerns			1
would n't it be great if the universe consisted solely of keeping up with @entity3 , her sisters , mother and her stepfather , @entity61 , who won an olympic gold medal for the decathlon and who should also receive a medal for plastic surgery -- his face is as smooth and wrinkle - free as a honeydew melon			1
we would n't have to worry about the challenges of the @entity9 economy , @entity73 teetering on the verge of default ( and potentially dragging down the eurozone ) or @entity79 president @entity78 's troops killing unarmed protesters			0
instead , we 'd worry : does @entity3 have to give the wedding gifts back ? will she start dating right away -- especially since the @entity84 lockout offers her more options ? will her divorce hearings be on cable or pay - per - view ? my fear is that @entity3 truly is our world			1
@entity3 , @entity92 and @entity93 have become the trinity worshipped at the expense of following domestic and world events			1
i know many people might ask : " why should i care about issues beyond those featured on @entity18 's ' @entity100 ' or @entity19 ? does it really impact me ? can i actually change things ? " i do n't want to repeat clich√©s like " one person can make a difference			2
" but common sense tells me that if we do n't understand the issues facing our nation , how can we have an opinion on them ? and in turn , how can we then intelligently criticize or support decisions our government is making , from taxes to foreign policy ? leadership from " we , the @entity123 " might be the only way to push our dysfunctional @entity119 to actually do something that helps the middle class and our economy			1
just last week , @entity119 showed us what happens when we leave members to their own devices			2
instead of considering a jobs bill or anything else to spur our economy , the @entity127 voted to reaffirm " @entity131 " as the official motto of the @entity9			0
that should truly help the almost 14 million @entity9 of out of work			0
i propose that rep. @entity134 , who came up with the idea for this , be required to reimburse taxpayers for any money wasted on this			0
regardless if you agree or not with tea partiers ' stand on political issues , they clearly have impacted @entity9 policy			1
the @entity146 was started by a small group of dedicated , passionate people and it has grown in a few short years to a powerful force			0
and while it 's too soon to tell , the " @entity151 " movement might also influence policy , or at least bring some issues to light			2
@entity162 's words on the benefits of an informed electorate are still true : " whenever the people are well - informed , they can be trusted with their own government ; that whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice , they may be relied on to set them right			0
" i 'm not saying we should n't keep up with the @entity167 , but let 's also keep up with the issues facing our nation			2
we deserve better than what we are getting from " our " @entity119 , and by being informed , it is my hope we can set it right			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity175 : we *'re* *obessed* with @entity3 : she 's on six magazine covers
he says news about her at least gave everybody a respite from the real news
but we should be paying just as much attention to political issues , @entity175 says
left on its own , @entity119 votes on national motto , he writes . we need to keep it on task
