-- racist , unfunny , hilarious , confusing , lame			1
a @entity2 cartoon has sparked a debate over race and cartooning this week			1
reactions are as varied as they are strong to tuesday 's @entity2 cartoon that depicted the police shooting of a chimpanzee			1
two police officers , one with a smoking gun , are near the chimp 's bullet - pierced body			1
" they 'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill , " one officer says			0
the @entity2 's @entity18 used a typical editorial cartoon trope of linking two current news stories : the shooting of a chimp after it mauled a @entity24 woman and president @entity26 's signing of the stimulus bill			1
but soon after the issue hit newsstands , the rev. @entity29 , and other black opinion makers such as @entity0 's @entity31 , blasted the cartoon as an attack on @entity26 's skin color and african - americans in general			1
" being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of president @entity26 and has become synonymous with him , it is not a reach to wonder : are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill ? " @entity29 said			1
@entity44 , a @entity45 history professor and the author of a forthcoming book about @entity26 , told @entity0 that the cartoon offended on many levels			1
ireport.com : chimp cartoon ' very , very wrong ' he winced at the cartoon 's gun violence as a stoker to the nervousness some feel about the safety of a black president in a historically racist country			1
" when i looked at it , there was no getting around the implications of it , " @entity44 said			0
" clearly anyone with an iota of sense knows the close association of black people and the primate imagery			0
" dozens of cartoonists weighed in on @entity71			0
some said it was a simpleton move to use the tired metaphor of a monkey to make fun of something -- no matter what it was			0
one poster wrote , " @entity81 ... ? " pointing out that @entity26 did n't write the stimulus package ; lawmakers did			0
on the cartoon " danger scale " of 1 to 10 , the chimp cartoon scored a 9 , @entity88 creator @entity87 told @entity0			1
@entity87 liked the cartoon , but judging its overall worthiness is difficult , a gauge best measured by an audience , not the cartoonist , he said			1
" any cartoon has to be a little bit dangerous , and he 's definitely achieved that , " he said			1
" you have to perceive that the cartoonist is in personal danger or there 's something dangerous about it , that at the cartoonist 's next cocktail party , half of the people there are going to want to poison his drink			1
" just like @entity111 's seven dirty words , there are also no - no 's for cartoons , @entity87 said			1
" he 's got everything you should n't have , " he said			2
" gunfire , that 's the one thing you can not get away with			2
and then he 's got violence against animals , also a pretty big no. " @entity2 editor @entity120 referred calls to a public relations representative , who sent @entity0 this statement : " the cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event , to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in @entity24			1
it broadly mocks @entity132 's efforts to revive the economy			2
again , @entity29 reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist			1
" @entity18 was not giving interviews , the pr rep told @entity0			0
if there is any apology due , it should n't come from the cartoonist , insisted @entity142 , the president of the @entity143 , whose cartoons run in 100 publications across the @entity146			2
an editor should object if there is a strong possibility that a cartoon will not resonate the way the cartoonist wanted , he said			1
cartoonists have to be free to be creative , to not edit themselves during the drawing process			0
" he was trying trying to jam two stories together , and unfortunately , this is what a lot of lame editors like , " @entity142 said			0
" the comparison he had in mind : the guy who wrote the package was n't @entity26 ; it was a bunch of white economic advisers , and he [ @entity18 ] was n't thinking about @entity26			0
" the @entity2 cartoonist , he added , has the misfortune of working in a business that , over the past decade , has become a graveyard of gag jokes			1
a former editor once told @entity174 that satire in cartooning died after september 11			2
" i have to wonder about the competence of his editors , " @entity142 continued			0
" it goes with the ' make it shorter and dumber ' mentality that 's happening in print			2
" but later thursday the @entity2 apologized in a statement on its web site , although they also defended its action and blasted some detractors			1
" wednesday 's @entity191 cartoon -- caricaturing monday 's police shooting of a chimpanzee in @entity24 -- has created considerable controversy , " the paper said			1
the @entity2 said the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an " ineptly written " stimulus bill			1
" but it has been taken as something else -- as a depiction of president @entity26 , as a thinly veiled expression of racism , " reads the statement			0
" this most certainly was not its intent ; to those who were offended by the image , we apologize			0
" but the statement immediately swerves to fire back at some of the image 's critics			2
" however , there are some in the media and in public life who have had differences with @entity217 in the past -- and they see the incident as an opportunity for payback , " the statement says			0
" to them , no apology is due			0
sometimes a cartoon is just a cartoon -- even as the opportunists seek to make it something else			2
" cartoonist @entity228 of the @entity229 in @entity230 said @entity18 had to expect people to be offended			0
" the racial connotation of what he drew , it 's really silly that either he or his editors could n't anticipate that [ reaction ] , " @entity228 said			2
" when i think about all the things that are thrown around here with the accusations of being racist ... that is one of the things as a cartoonist you have to be aware of -- what you 're doing and that you know things are going to be taken that way			2
you are the first - line editor			1
" syndicated political cartoonist @entity250 did n't find the @entity2 cartoon racist , but he said it probably was in bad taste			1
" a woman was terribly mauled and almost killed , " he said			0
" that 's really the only grounds by which [ my editors ] would throw out a cartoon			1
when it involves somebody 's life like that , i would tend to stay away from it			2
" @entity263 knows a little about what it feels like to create a polarizing cartoon			2
in 2006 , around the time of the @entity269 mohammed cartoon controversy , the @entity266 published a cartoon he drew showing a blurred picture of @entity273 on @entity0			0
the cartoonist had been watching the network cover the story about @entity278 anger over the @entity269 cartoons , which showed the prophet with a bomb crafted out of his turban			0
@entity263 was upset that @entity0 had chosen to blur the cartoon in its coverage			0
the cartoonist immediately drew his cartoon , which showed a couple watching tv and saying , " well , no wonder @entity278 are upset			0
@entity273 looks like he 's on acid			0
" " i was inundated with e-mail , the paper was picketed , " he said			0
" there was quite a reaction			0

new : @entity2 apologizes , but also defends its cartoon
some say cartoon is racist , others say it 's *misunderstood*
on 1 - 10 " danger scale " for cartoons , @entity88 creator calls cartoon a 9
post editor defends cartoon , calls the rev. @entity29 an " opportunist "
