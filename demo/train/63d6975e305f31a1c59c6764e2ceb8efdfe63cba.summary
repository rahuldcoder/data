" i had no idea that a highly paid , high - ranking military officer had just attacked me			0

@entity24 said the resulting media attention and scrutiny has placed additional stress on her and her family			0
before sentencing , @entity14 turned to @entity24 and apologized			2
" i am sincerely sorry for causing fear and misunderstanding and all of the intense public exposure that you have suffered , " @entity14 said			2
" i hope very much that we can all move forward from this with privacy and peace			0
