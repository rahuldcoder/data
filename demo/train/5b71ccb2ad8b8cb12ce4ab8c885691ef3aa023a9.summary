editor 's note : the following article was translated from @entity3 to @entity4 using @entity5			1
( @entity6 ) -- it 's relatively easy to find @entity4 , @entity3 , @entity8 and @entity10 courses online			0
but , what if you want to learn @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 or @entity15 ? or a fictitious language such as @entity18 from " @entity19 " or @entity20 from the " @entity22 " saga ? then it gets more complicated			0
the supply for online language education is dominated by the most frequently spoken languages in the world for obvious reasons : they are the most useful for communication and are therefore in most demand			2
however , linguistic diversity is a world heritage that 's at risk of disappearing			0
according to studies , 10 languages disappear every year , and this process is accelerating over time			0
but technology could come to the rescue			0
@entity5 , the successful language - learning app , has announced the launch of an " incubator " that will allow any user to create new courses for different languages			1
' crowdsourcing ' to create the courses any user ? yes , any user as long as they know the language they want to teach and the language from which it will be taught			1
for example , if a user knows how to speak @entity3 and @entity12 perfectly , they will be able to create a @entity12 course for @entity3 speakers			0
@entity5 's plan is to appeal to collective intelligence and " crowdsourcing " to recruit an army of volunteers to develop these courses			2
" there is only going to be one course for each language ; and for each language , we will choose between two and three moderators through an application system and a selection process			2
then these moderators can choose teams of people to help them , " explains @entity73 , the @entity74 creator of @entity5 and one of the pioneers of crowdsourcing			1
according to @entity5 , one person working 40 hours per week would require about four months to develop one of these courses , so bringing together a good team will be necessary for the initiative to succeed , something that @entity73 is not concerned about			1
the task of creating a language course seems to only be within the reach of expert linguists , but the method that @entity5 has developed is " pretty restricted , with a concrete lists of words and the order in which they must be used , with easy phrases , " says @entity73			1
the language incubator guides the user so they only have to follow a few standardized steps to create any course			0
the system has a number of consistency algorithms that verify the quality of the courses			0
once finished , they start out as beta versions that will improve according to user feedback			0
if the established learning metrics are not achieved , @entity5 closes the course and invites the moderator to improve it until it is effective			0
what 's the incentive ? it seems like creating a course on @entity5 will be hard work , but the company is clear on the fact that it will not pay any of the collaborators who participate			2
" our objective is to teach the world languages for free , so we also expect others to collaborate for free , " says the creator of @entity5			1
at the moment , @entity5 is financed by $ 18 million of venture capital and with translations that the system generates			2
the names of the course creators will be displayed , and they will receive all the credit			0
will that be enough incentive ? @entity73 , also famous for being one of the inventors of the authentication method known as @entity138 , says he had received " more than a thousand e-mails in the last year and a half from people willing to collaborate			0
" there are also organizations interested in this new @entity5 tool , among them a foundation in the south of @entity147 that wants to develop courses of indigenous languages in the area			1
several schools and universities in the world are already using @entity5 to teach languages , and according to estimates from the company , there are close to 30,000 students that follow its method			1
the @entity5 philosophy in a short time , @entity5 has become one of the most popular methods for learning languages because it requires only an internet connection and a smartphone to be immersed in the learning experience			2
according to @entity5 , which also has apps for @entity171 and @entity172 , between 60,000 and 70,000 people register to the site every day ( there are 10 million total registered users )			1
the app has been downloaded more than six million times in the @entity172 version and more than seven million times in the @entity171 version for @entity182 and @entity183 , which makes @entity5 the most downloaded educational app in @entity185 and @entity186 , respectively			2
the whole philosophy of @entity5 is based on teaching its users about 3,000 basic words of each language , as well as a series of basic structures for expressing ideas in different verb tenses			1
" if someone knows how to say those 3,000 things , they can already express a lot of things in that language ... although obviously not enough to write an article for @entity6 , " jokes @entity73			0
it seems quite simple at first glance , but the company estimates that hundreds of hours are required to finish any one of their courses			0
until now , more than 100,000 people have received the " @entity208 " , which symbolizes that somebody has graduated in one of the languages taught by @entity5			1
for some of its users , this is a dream come true ; as user @entity215 summed up in one of the @entity5 forum threads : " i am crying because this site is what i always dreamed of : language learning for free , in the most fun way possible			1

language app @entity5 creating system for users to teach languages
the " incubator " lets people *fluent* in two languages to team up on a course
a goal is to *highlight* *obscure* languages not taught as often as major ones
the tool is free to use , and *contributors* will not be paid
