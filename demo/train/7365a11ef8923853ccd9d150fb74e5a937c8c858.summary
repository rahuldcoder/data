-- monday night 's tribute to @entity2 at the @entity3 was moving and powerful and funny , like the man himself			1
when i first heard the news about @entity2 ' apparent suicide , like millions of his fans , i felt heartbroken			1
he was so brave , talented , funny and brilliant			2
what a loss of a great actor and a great man			2
in days that followed , i learned that @entity2 had been battling severe depression			1
this brought back memories of my own battle with depression many years ago when i was a teenager			1
i never told anyone about it because i was terrified that i would be judged			2
but the time has come for me to share this with my family , friends and the world			1
earlier this year when i read that six students from a high school in @entity29 committed suicide during a three - year period , my eyes welled with tears and i felt incredibly sad			1
i knew i could not remain silent anymore			2
i did n't want to read about another student taking his own life who had to deal with the same intense , complicated challenges that i dealt with			1
i called the school district and was invited to speak at its @entity38			2
i felt humbled and honored , and scared at the same time			1
after speaking at the summit , guests of all ages lined the aisle to tell me how my message gave them hope			0
in essence , what i shared in that speech was that depression can be overcome , but it takes a village			1
you never know what sharing your concern may mean to someone in pain			0
my pastor recently told me i have become a living testimony of how a support network can help others find rest in the midst of storm			1
living life as a husband , a father and a journalist assigned to overnight shifts is not easy			0
even the best of us will be tested to their limits			0
some days , i do n't know if i 'm getting it right at all			1
those who suffer depression have it tough			1
i would like to share how i found hope in the midst of my storm			1
i created a system for myself to remain focused , laser focused , on staying free from storm			0
for young people who face storms of their own , here 's my story			0
i was that kid , in the midst of storm			0
i am the son of proud immigrant parents who drilled into me a sense of duty to repay the opportunity afforded me			0
with @entity99 " success " comes the responsibility to accept the full weight of their dreams of a better life for their children			0
i thank my parents for setting standards that stay with me to this day			0
my parents moved us to a nice @entity104 suburban neighborhood surrounded by opportunity , but it was isolating			0
at age 16 , i fell into a deep and dark emotional hole			0
the stress of school , sports and assimilation became too much to bear			0
i felt guilty for wanting to abandon my cultural heritage			1
i would later learn that this despair i felt was actually a suffering from depression			1
but at the time , i only knew that i was in unimaginable darkness and loneliness , even if i were surrounded by people			0
going public with depression one day after school , i was at home babysitting my napping , 7 - year - old sister			1
i became overwhelmed with anxiety			0
tears rolled down my face			0
i was scared , but did n't know what i would do			1
i picked up the phone and called a classmate named @entity131			0
i do n't recall exactly what i said , but i know i was at my end			1
after we hung up , she called a teacher , mrs. @entity136 , in my high school and within minutes @entity136 appeared on my doorstep			0
suddenly , i was not alone			0
she called my parents , and suddenly i was surrounded by a village			1
a village that gave me the courage not to hide from them my pain			1
i held on to that village and never looked back			1
i used those experiences to form a list of guiding principles that i have honed through life that i use to weather those everyday storms of life			0
i call it the laser system			0
laser is an acronym for @entity156 , assess , support , execute and @entity158			1
it 's designed to provide a systematic , positive and consistent approach to help individuals endure challenges and perform through stress			0
mental health help : where to turn in my role at @entity0 as a senior news editor , i help decide what gets covered			2
unfortunately , all too frequently , i cover stories of youngsters , professional athletes and personalities who did n't find a way out of despair and die tragically			2
@entity2 , sadly , is one of many on the list			1
the common thread we often learn in those cases is that there was no village			2
there was no one there to listen and @entity188 , to show them that life is full of possibilities and promise , and there are people who love them			0
i write to reach those who find themselves slipping , and to urge those around them to help			2
you can manage through crisis			0
how ? listen ( intently to when someone is in trouble ) assess ( what the problem could be ) support ( the person to live and dream ) execute ( a plan to get help ) respond ( if initial actions do n't help ) the first letter in each of the words just mentioned forms the word laser , like a beam of light that can help you in the dark			1
i was on the verge of being defeated more times than i care to count			0
at each challenge , i found a way out of the storm with the village			2
i was armed with a laser focus that in life i am not alone , that storms come and go			0
can you be a part of a village to someone ? can you be their haven from storms ? the difference begins with you			2
each and every one of you			0
to anyone who might be struggling -- you 're not alone			0
it 's ok to be afraid			2
it 's ok to hurt			0
what 's not ok is keeping those feelings to yourself			2
it takes courage to share those feelings			1
reach out to your village			1
to those around someone who 's struggling , know that it took me 10 years to fully share with my school friend how her single , simple act of making a phone call to a caring teacher set a chain of events that changed the course of my life			2
who would have thought that that kid who struggled to succeed academically and socially then would be flourishing at arguably the most prestigious and influential media organization in the world ? i thank @entity262 every day that someone showed up with an umbrella in the midst of my storm , and gave me a haven , and that a village came to make me believe in my promise and my purpose , and that i can look in the mirror every day now with laser focus , with hope , in spite of the storms , and use my principles to live and thrive			2
my heart goes out to @entity2 ' wife and family			1
for all those who are struggling with depression , do n't slip into the darkness , because it does n't have to be that way .			1

@entity286 : when i heard the news about @entity2 ' death i felt heartbroken
@entity286 : it brought back memories of my own battle with depression as a youth
he says depression is overwhelming , but it can be overcome - it takes a village
@entity286 : do n't be afraid to share your feelings , ask for help and reach out for support
