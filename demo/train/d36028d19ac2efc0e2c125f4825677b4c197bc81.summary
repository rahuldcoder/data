-- the racially charged email that led to @entity5 controlling owner @entity4 giving up his team was discovered after another member of the @entity5 leadership made a racial comment , the team 's ceo said			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 , @entity5 ceo @entity10 said the comment during a june conference call about free agents prompted an internal investigation			1
that comment was made by @entity5 general manager @entity17 , @entity10 said			1
@entity10 told @entity0 that @entity18 has been punished " in excess " for the comment , but gave no details			2
@entity0 spoke with a source with knowledge of the @entity5 probe who said that @entity17 was relaying information that an outside party had given him about player @entity28			1
@entity28 now plays for the @entity29			0
@entity5 owners were on the call , the source told @entity0			2
it 's common for a team , when discussing free agent players , to gather information about those players , because they could be given multimillion - dollar contracts			0
what @entity17 relayed was racially insensitive , and that prompted one of the team 's owners to say that a closer look at the organization was needed			1
during that probe , @entity4 's email was uncovered			1
attempts to reach @entity18 on monday were unsuccessful			0
on sunday , @entity17 told the @entity50 : " i support @entity10 ( @entity52 ) 's leadership and greatly appreciate his support			0
i look to learn from this situation and help us become a better organization			0
" what we know so far a two - month investigation after the june conference call , the @entity5 brought in an outside law firm to review the organization from top to bottom , in an investigation that took two months to complete			2
" there were 19 people interviewed , 24,000 pieces of evidence looked at , and in that discovery -- that internal investigation -- this email that we released this morning was found , from @entity4 , " @entity10 told @entity0 's @entity65 on sunday night			1
" @entity4 was confronted with this email from 2012 , and he decided that instead of fighting it ... he thought it was best for the city , for the team , for his family , to walk away			1
" the email to @entity18 -- which bemoaned the high percentage of black cheerleaders and said that white fans may have been scared away by black fans -- led @entity4 to announce sunday that he will sell his controlling stake in the team			1
@entity4 's 2012 email addressed the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season - ticket holders			1
the owner said he had taken a look around @entity93 and noticed a few things			0
first , the audience was 70 % black , he wrote			2
the stadium 's bars were 90 % black			0
there were few fathers and sons at the games			0
the music played in the arena was hip - hop , and the after - game concerts were either rap or gospel acts			0
" then i start looking around at other arenas			0
even ( @entity114 ) @entity114 with its affluent black community never has more than 15 pct black audience , " he wrote			2
@entity10 has been the @entity5 ' ceo for two months			2
he said he was " mortified and angry " about the email and met with the team 's players sunday night			0
" it was like walking into a funeral , " @entity10 said of the meeting			0
" these are young men who wear our city 's name and our logo on their chest			0
they play for a team , and they are supposed to be supported by their ownership			0
and ownership failed in supporting them			0
" read the email in its entirety ' i trivialized our fans ' in his announcement sunday , @entity4 said he will sell his controlling stake in the team after an " email two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive			1
" a man answering the phone at his @entity146 home told @entity0 that @entity4 was not taking any phone calls			2
in focusing on low attendance at @entity5 games and the need to boost season - ticket sales and corporate sponsors , @entity4 said in his statement , he had spoken with executives about diversifying the fan base and including more suburban whites			1
during those discussions , " i shared my thoughts on why our efforts to bridge @entity5 's racial sports divide seemed to be failing , " he wrote			1
" i trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests ( i.e. hip hop vs. country , white vs. black cheerleaders , etc. ) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another ( i.e. that white fans might be afraid of our black fans ) , " he said in his statement			1
" by focusing on race , i also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans			1
" ' the black crowd scared away the whites ' in his 2012 email , @entity4 wrote that before his @entity179 bought the @entity5 in 2003 , thousands of tickets were being given away , mostly to the black community , in an effort to make the arena appear less empty			1
it was a trend that continued for a couple of years after the @entity179 took over , he wrote in a seemingly informal email rife with punctuation errors and misspellings			2
" my theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base , " he wrote			1
" i never felt uncomfortable , but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority			0
" @entity4 derided claims on fan websites that the arena is unsafe or in a bad part of town as " racist garbage , " but then suggested an array of changes inside the stadium , all based on race			2
' i want some white cheerleaders ' " i have been open with our executive team about these concerns			1
i have told them i want some white cheerleaders and while i do n't care what the color of the artist is , i want the music to be music familiar to a 40 year old white guy if that 's our season tixs demo , " he wrote			1
he continued , " i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black			0
i have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black			0
" things had changed since @entity4 implemented these suggestions , he wrote , boasting that the crowd was closer to 40 % black by 2012 , by his admittedly unscientific estimate			1
that was still four to five times higher than other @entity230 franchises , he wrote , " and my further guess is that 40 pct still feels like 70 ( percent ) to some whites at our games			2
our bars are still overwhelmingly black			0
" while noting this was a sensitive issue , @entity4 went on to declare it " far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so low			0
and many of our black fans do n't have the spendable income which explains why our ( food and beverage ) and merchandise sales are so low			1
at all white thrasher games sales were nearly triple what they are at hawks games			0
" the year before @entity4 wrote the controversial email , the @entity179 sold its @entity253 team , the @entity252 , to a @entity255 ownership group that moved the team north of the border			1
it 's now called the @entity258			0
comparisons to @entity260 in his sunday statement , @entity4 said the @entity230 should have no tolerance for racism , a sentiment he also expressed during a @entity0 interview earlier this year when he talked about @entity260 , the @entity266 owner who was caught making racist remarks on tape			1
team owners behaving badly discussing @entity260 's reluctance to sell the team after the scandal broke , @entity4 said in may that , as a fellow team owner , he could n't be partners with someone who holds those types of views			1
" i think i speak for all of my partners when i say we were all deeply offended			0
we all quickly spoke out against the words we heard on that tape , " @entity4 said			0
@entity230 commissioner @entity282 , who brought the hammer down on @entity284 , called @entity4 's 2012 email " entirely unacceptable " and commended @entity4 for self - reporting to the league office			2
@entity4 told the league in july about the august 2012 email , and the @entity230 conducted an investigation , the statement said			2
" ( @entity4 ) shared with me how truly remorseful he is for using those hurtful words and how apologetic he is to the entire @entity230 family -- fans , players , team employees , business partners and fellow team owners -- for having diverted attention away from our game , " @entity282 said			2
the league will work with the @entity5 to determine the appropriate sale process for the team , @entity282 said			0
@entity10 , the @entity5 ceo , will oversee team operations , the league said			0
in closing his statement , @entity4 said he was embarrassed by the email and apologized to the team and its fans			1
" to the @entity5 family and its fans , you have my deepest gratitude for the past ten years , " @entity4 wrote			1
" working with this team and its extraordinary executives , coaching staff , and players has been one of the highlights of my life			0
i am proud of our diverse , passionate , and growing legion of @entity5 fans , and i will continue to join you in cheering for the best team in the @entity230			2
" according to the @entity5 website , @entity4 , a former journalist , co-founded @entity325 , a portfolio of business information companies , and is a founding shareholder and former board member for @entity330 , a technology media company			1
@entity10 said that while @entity4 will make money from the sale , he is still paying a price			0
" the only thing we all have in our life is our reputation , and his was damaged today -- by him , and not by anyone else			0
" opinion : @entity4 and the @entity5 ' real problem opinion : @entity5 owner is a hypocrite @entity0 's @entity344 , @entity345 , and @entity346 contributed to this report .			1
