-- dear @entity1 , my own schooling taught me that the opportunity to learn is a gift , and the guidance of a good teacher is life - changing			2
it is important as a girl to learn how to earn your own living , stand up for your own point of view and share your skills and experiences with others			2
as the great @entity18 proverb goes , you must lift as you climb			2
in school , i learned that reading , writing and numeracy are powerful tools for life , but so too are stories : stories about our own histories and our culture ; stories we can tell , draw , write and perform			0
how we see ourselves becomes who we are -- so we must see ourselves as tall and strong and kind , and connected to others			0
being safe is a prerequisite for learning			0
if girls are not safe when they walk to school , attend school and as they return home , everything is taken away			1
we must all fight for our sisters to be safe from violence of any kind , so that they are free to learn , grow and flourish			0
learning with and about boys is important -- we all live together in our world			1
despite the heightened focus on girls , it 's important not to forget to teach boys that their own learning and the learning of their sisters are equally valuable			1
we have , among ourselves , the power to change the lives of everyone			0
each of us must use our voice through whatever networks we have to spread the news that educating girls will transform the world			1
we must talk to our neighbors , tell our friends , share our tweets and blogs , and create a great noise so that no leader , no education official and no head teacher or principal can avoid hearing the message : that every child -- which means every single girl -- deserves to go to school and learn			0
