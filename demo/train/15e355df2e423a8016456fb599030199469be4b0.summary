-- @entity2 domination of the @entity4 season came to a shuddering halt in final qualifying for the @entity7 saturday as @entity9 veteran @entity8 took pole position			1
@entity8 held off @entity12 teammate @entity11 of @entity13 with championship leader @entity14 only third for @entity2			1
@entity14 's teammate @entity15 fared worse , having to settle for ninth fastest on an afternoon of upsets			1
@entity15 , 22 points behind @entity14 in the title race after failing to finish in the previous round in @entity20 , had his first effort in the last session of qualifying ruled out for running wide on the circuit then spun on the second			1
it was the 33 - year - old @entity8 who adapted best to the twisting circuit at @entity28 , which is being used to host the first @entity29 @entity7 since @entity30 won in 2003			1
his time of one minute 8.579 seconds gave him his 16th career @entity4 pole and deprived @entity14 of his third straight pole			2

it 's such a great moment			0
it 's been a long time since i had my last pole position , which was in @entity9 in 2008 , " @entity8 said			0
@entity2 , with @entity12 pressing them , had dominated the three practice sessions ahead of qualifying so @entity14 was surprised to trail when it mattered			1

" i will do my best			0
it was a strong performance ( from @entity8 and @entity11 ) but i think i can be faster in the race			2

it was a disappointing afternoon for @entity52 after @entity54 's victory in @entity55 where both @entity14 and @entity15 suffered technical problems			2
@entity54 eventually finished fifth -- just behind @entity58 's @entity57 -- but four - time world champion @entity59 failed to even make the final session and had to settle for 13th fastest			2
the hiccup in @entity20 aside , where @entity14 still managed second place , @entity2 had enjoyed a near perfect season heading into @entity29 with six victories and seven pole positions			1
@entity67 's @entity66 took 11th spot in qualifying , but will be penalized five places on the grid for his part in a late and high speed crash with @entity8 in @entity20 two weeks ago			0
