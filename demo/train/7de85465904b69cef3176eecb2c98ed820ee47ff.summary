-- police drones circling overhead , ready to help search for lost children , rescue stranded boaters and capture criminals			1
or drones equipped with lethal weapons , high - tech cameras able to see through clothing , and technology that monitors a person 's visit to religious or political events			1
those were divergent and tricky scenarios discussed at a congressional hearing on thursday ( october 25 ) , as lawmakers contemplated a market that experts believe could grow to 10,000 unmanned aircraft in five years			2
@entity21 has ordered the @entity22 to develop plans to integrate them into the national airspace system used by jetliners , private and military planes , helicopters and blimps by 2015			1
but there are challenges with safety and operations with anticipated police , homeland security , private and commercial use			1
@entity36 , another concern , was looked at closely at the congressional field hearing in @entity39			0
" we need to establish clear guidelines about when and for what purpose law enforcement agencies , private citizens , and businesses can use drones , " said rep. @entity40 , a @entity39 @entity41 and chairman of the @entity44 subcommittee on crime , terrorism , and homeland security			1
in many respects , privacy issues involving drones are no different than those presented by other aircraft and satellites , experts said			1
but traditional aircraft are costly and expensive to maintain , placing natural limits on their use			0
the low cost of drones will " erode that natural limit , " allowing governments to conduct regular surveillance on people , said @entity64 , legislative counsel for the @entity65			2
" as the number of drones rises , so , too , will the number of suspects , " said rep. @entity72 , a @entity74 @entity73			2
" during the civil rights movement , would activists have left their homes if they knew " they were being monitored from cameras 30,000 feet above ? " he asked			0
" if we take a @entity85 attitude towards this , we will see an erosion of our liberties , " @entity72 said			0
experts testified that @entity91 case law regarding police aerial surveillance relies heavily on the concept of the public 's " reasonable expectation " of privacy			1
but those expectations will change as drones become more commonplace , said @entity99 , president of @entity100 and former @entity101 of @entity102			2
" as technology changes , if we take no action , so do our expectations , " @entity99 said			0
so several witnesses at the hearing said a legislative fix is needed to uphold current standards of privacy			2
a bill introduced by @entity40 would prohibit the @entity22 from issuing a drone permit for use by law enforcement unless it is related to a warrant for the investigation of a felony , with some exceptions			1
it also would prohibit individuals from conducting surveillance on private individuals or private property without the owner 's consent			0
" we must decide now when drones can and can not be used in order to ensure constitutional safeguards , " @entity40 said			0
" technology may change with time , but the @entity131 does not			0
" but others cautioned against action that could stifle industry			0
" i think we 're at the birth of this technology , " said @entity135 , a professor at the @entity136			0
" it 's true that it 's exploding ; it 's a very fast growing baby , " he said , " but we would n't want to tell @entity142 at the birth of the telephone " to stop development because of privacy concerns .			1
