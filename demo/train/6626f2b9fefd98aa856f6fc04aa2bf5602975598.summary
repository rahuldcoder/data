-- after his inauguration , if president @entity2 needs real - time intelligence on crises around the world , he is likely to do it in the @entity8 , the ultra-secure conference room in the @entity10			1
it 's a place this new president may be seeing a lot of			0
interconnected crises : @entity16 children hold toy guns in an anti-israel protest			1
during the election campaign , @entity2 often talked about @entity20 , a war he opposed , and his plan to withdraw troops within 16 months			1
he stressed the need to increase @entity26 forces in @entity16			1
he criticized @entity27 for moving its troops into @entity30			0
ultimately , however , the campaign hinged on the economy			0
substantive debate over the long list of international challenges facing the @entity26 never happened			2
as soon as he lowers his hand after taking the oath of office , this new president is responsible for steering the @entity26 through the stormy waters of foreign policy dangers			0
he must decide not only which issues to take on , but when to take them on			0
but , in this interconnected world , the @entity26 president can not dictate the timing of world events			0
crises can hit at any time			2
an effective president must be ready to act quickly while , at the same time , keeping his long - term focus on strategic priorities			2
and everywhere he looks , a raft of questions need answering			0
so , where does @entity2 start ? @entity55 - @entity54 the conflict between @entity55 and the @entity54 conflict flared up again with deadly results just as @entity2 prepares to take office			1
the @entity62 administration 's last ditch efforts at forging a final status agreement between @entity55 and @entity64 is in tatters			1
will the new president continue the @entity62 policy of close alliance with @entity55 ? or will he talk tough to his @entity55 allies , urging them to refrain from air attacks and to stop building new settlements while , at the same time , pressing the @entity54 to stop their rocket attacks on @entity55 and crack down on terrorism ? should he pull out all the stops , trying for a high - stakes strategy of brokering peace and a two - state solution ? or should he just try to put out the immediate fire ? @entity20 president @entity2 takes office as the new @entity81 between the @entity26 and @entity20 , along with the @entity82 governing the presence of @entity26 forces in the country , goes into effect			1
@entity26 forces will now operate under new rules with the @entity20 military officially taking the lead			1
@entity26 forces are scheduled to be withdrawn by the end of 2011			0
but will @entity20 soldiers and police be up to the task of guaranteeing security for @entity20 citizens ? by december 31 , 2011 will @entity20 really be stable enough for @entity26 troops to leave ? @entity16 @entity2 wants @entity16 , not @entity20 , to be the central front in the battle against terrorism			1
with attacks by the @entity101 and other extremist groups on the rise , @entity16 is sinking into chaos			1
@entity2 calls the situation " urgent " and wants to send more troops			1
commanders in @entity16 are asking for up to 30,000 additional troops , joining the 36,000 already there			2
but , beyond the number of soldiers , what is @entity2 's strategy to win the war in @entity16 ? can he convince @entity115 allies to contribute more troops when they refused similar requests from president @entity62 ? can he " regionalize " his approach to the war , involving countries like @entity121 in the solution ? how will he carry out his plan to target @entity124 ? can @entity26 forces finally capture @entity126 ? @entity121 @entity121 's political power in the region is growing			1
@entity129 is moving forward with efforts to enrich uranium and , some fear , ultimately produce enough for a nuclear bomb			0
in one of the most controversial issues of the @entity26 presidential campaign @entity2 said he was willing to talk with the @entity26 ' enemies			1
will he follow through with @entity121 ? what if @entity55 carries out a pre-emptive strike on @entity121 's nuclear facilities before the talking is over ? @entity142 @entity142 's border regions have become havens for terrorists including , experts believe , @entity126			2
the @entity62 administration focused its relationship with nuclear - armed @entity142 on the military under general @entity150 , an uneasy alliance dictated by the war on terrorism			2
but concentrating on the military meant ignoring @entity142 's civilian government			0
how will @entity2 balance the need to work with the military and security forces of @entity142 without undermining @entity142 's already - weakened democracy which , in turn , leads to more instability ? @entity27 in the wake of war in @entity30 , @entity26 - @entity27 relations are in their worst state since the end of the @entity167 and the potential for serious conflict between @entity170 and @entity171 is growing			1
@entity27 experts are urging @entity2 to review the relationship from top to bottom , establishing with @entity171 new " rules of the game " that would avoid the current cycle of @entity26 lecturing and @entity27 blustering			2
will @entity2 follow their advice and work with @entity27 as an equal on challenges like @entity121 and nuclear non-proliferation ? financial meltdown the world - wide financial crisis is not just an economic issue ; it can limit the ability of the new president to project @entity26 power internationally			1
potentially it could destabilize countries			0
many other nations , including @entity26 's friends , blame the origins of the crisis on the @entity26 , and @entity2 will need as many friends as he can get -- plus a coordinated world response -- to end this meltdown			1
a world transformed one of the biggest challenges facing the new @entity26 president is not a country , or an international leader , it 's the world itself in which power -- economic and political -- is shifting			0
new players are emerging : @entity211 , @entity27 , @entity212 , and @entity213 , the so - called " @entity215 " countries			0
non-traditional issues like climate change are playing an increasing role in the @entity26 ' foreign policy			0
so is competition for energy supplies			0
from his seat in the @entity224 , president @entity2 will see a world filled with threats -- and opportunities			2
by establishing his priorities early , he can be ready for both .			0

@entity55 - @entity54 flared up again during the presidential *transition* period
@entity20 and @entity16 and their role in the war on terror
@entity2 will need international help to battle the global financial meltdown
how @entity2 reacts to crises will define his presidency
