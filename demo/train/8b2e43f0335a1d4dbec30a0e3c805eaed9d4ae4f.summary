-- development in @entity2 has not been slow			1
in half a century , the small @entity3 has grown from a hilly , desert landscape with 143,000 inhabitants to an overcrowded metropolis of 1.2 million residents			2
the most striking change , however , has been topographical			0
up until the 1960s , the country boasted the world 's largest collection of prehistoric burial mounds -- an archaeological wonder left over from the 4,000 - year - old @entity17 civilization			1
in the decades that followed , 90 % of these funerary hills fell victim to housing and infrastructure pressure , and were demolished to make room for causeways and residential estates			1
" it 's a really important archive , " notes @entity26 , an archaeologist with the @entity27 who has been excavating a collection referred to as the " royal " mounds in the northern district of @entity31			1
the royal mounds are so called because of their stature -- many measure 40 feet in height			2
the entombed , however , ranged from community leaders to the heads of commercial dynasties			0
aside from the sheer breadth of mounds -- at their peak they numbered 76,000 -- their importance rests in their age , rarity and what they reveal about ancient society			2
@entity26 has found that that the oldest mounds date from 2050 @entity54 , when @entity17 ( the name the @entity56 used to refer to the country ) was little more than a collection of tribes , to 1750 @entity54 , by which time it had morphed into an economic powerhouse in the region			1

i see them as a unique laboratory for the study of social improvements			0
it 's really an important archive , " he says			0
unfortunately , the mounds have for decades been at odds with development in the country			2
@entity2 is only 760 square kilometers yet it has the third highest population density in the world			1
" there is huge pressure to build houses for the expanding population			0
it 's an issue that 's probably present in other counties , but it 's exacerbated in @entity2 because of how little land is available , " says @entity91 , an archaeologist who in the 1990s led excavations of a settlement near the burial field at @entity95 in the northwest			1
@entity91 remembers leaving the site only to return and find a set of particularly impressive mounds bulldozed by a private developer			2
" @entity2 's archeology department was able to carry out a little rescue work , but it was minimal , and over a very short time span , " he recalls			1
" now , it 's a wasteland of flattened land with half - built houses on it			0
" @entity112 , the managing director at @entity113 ! , an organization working with the @entity115 to secure heritage status , points out that the sheer percentage of land the mounds covered makes preservation a thorny , and at times unfeasible prospect			1
" @entity121 is a strong need here			0
there are a good number of young families looking for flats , who in the meantime are forced to live with their parents			0
the need for development and the use of cultural resources needs to be balanced in a useful way , " she says			0
in the last five years , however , there 's been a push by @entity2 's @entity115 to better preserve the country 's national treasures			1
video : reviving ' lost ' @entity142 cuisine " @entity2 feels a huge responsibility to preserve the remaining mounds , and to transfer them to future generations , " says @entity112 , who estimates that should @entity143 approve their petition , the mounds should be granted protection by 2016			1
" we hope that the concept will also allow the communities near the fields to gain a financial benefit			0
" some experts , however , argue the bulk of damage has already been done			0
" it 's really too little , too late , " says @entity91			0
" when i worked in @entity2 in the 1990s and saw what happened to the burial field at @entity95 , i thought , in 20 years , @entity2 will be concrete from one side of the island to the other			1
it 's only when a society looks back and realizes its heritage is gone that it truly understands what it has lost			2
