@entity0 -- nearly 150,000 refugees from @entity4 's civil war remain detained in @entity6 internment camps , according to the @entity0 ' chief humanitarian affairs official , @entity7			1
briefing the media monday at @entity0 headquarters in @entity10 , @entity7 said that the @entity4 government showed " good progress in some important areas " but said there are " plenty of problems still to resolve			1
" @entity7 is freshly returned from a three - day trip to @entity4 where he met with government officials and war refugees to reassess that government 's efforts towards resettling the estimated 280,000 civilians that have been held in internment camps there since the final stages of @entity4 's civil war			2
the @entity4 government had previously promised to release all of its internally displaced people ( @entity27 ) from the camps within a 180 - day window after the end of the war in may , but missed its deadline earlier this month			1
it has now set a deadline of january 2010 for full resettlement			1
@entity7 reported that despite a late start , the release of @entity27 from the camps is now occurring at a faster pace			0
" if people can move freely in and out of camps , then the question of the speed of return becomes a little bit less critical , " he explained , noting that some refugees are now able to sign themselves in and out of the camps for a few days at a time , if not permanently			0
the refugee families allowed to return home have been promised relief packages including tin sheets for roofing from the @entity54 government and at least 25,000 rupees ( us $ 218.30 ) from the @entity0 ' refugee agency			1
@entity7 anticipated that " those needs will continue for at least six months , " adding that humanitarian organizations on the ground in @entity4 believe a residual caseload of 20,000 to 30,000 refugees will remain homeless in january			2
@entity7 also expressed concern over the quality of the @entity4 government 's recent actions on the camps			1
" we would have wanted more consultation with the @entity27 themselves ; that 's in accordance with the guiding principles for how the internally displaced should be treated , " @entity7 explained			0
he said that many of those released from the camps were returning to villages where their homes and possessions had been destroyed by acts of war and where sluggish efforts to remove landmines meant that paths were left perilous			0
" but on other hand there is no disputing the general willingness of people to return and to endure what they have to endure in order to reestablish themselves , " he added			0
since october 2008 , the @entity4 government has used internment camps to detain nearly 300,000 civilians during its civil war against the @entity95			2
while the @entity4 government justified its use of the camps as a way to protect civilians from landmines and @entity106 separatists , its continued use of the camps after the end of the war in may have led some to accuse @entity4 of violating international humanitarian rights law			2
" what we need to keep focusing on is accountability for violations for international human rights law for both sides during the conflict , " @entity7 advised			0
" we 're also very keen to encourage the process of political reconciliation , which is fundamental to make sure the opportunity posed by the end of the war is not missed			0
