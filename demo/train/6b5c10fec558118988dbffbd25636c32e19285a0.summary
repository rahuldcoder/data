when @entity1 swept through the @entity2 in july , a tiny ship was trapped in its path			2
the deadly storm whipped up waves over 10 meters high and winds approaching 200 miles per hour			2
any regular boat would have been smashed to pieces , but this craft just a few feet long sailed through without pausing in its work			2
the @entity11 is an ocean drone developed by @entity14 start - up @entity11			1
it had been collecting environmental information when the storm hit , and continued throughout the encounter to compile a unique dataset of the conditions created by @entity21			2
the craft 's instruments recorded the speed and movement of waves , current and wind from the epicenter , the first such measurements from such a powerful storm , which are now available for scientists to use in the development of warning systems			1
the glider consists of two parts : a surfboard - like shell that floats along the surface , bearing a row of solar panels that power the craft			2
this is connected by cable to the sophisticated measuring tools that float five meters below , protected from the fiercest elements , propelled by wave - powered wings that also serve as an anchor to make it almost indestructible			2
" we can put them in places where humans would not be happy to go ... there is huge potential to save lives and prevent damage , " said @entity49 , co-founder of @entity11			1
" it 's pretty clear that we can forecast the direction of a hurricane , the intensity , and better understand the original formation of storms			2
" read this : robot furniture builds itself beyond averting disasters , the drone is being used on missions to break new water in understanding the 95 % of the world 's oceans that remain unexplored			1
wave gliders are measuring acidification levels and environmental damage , and monitoring wildlife to aid conservation efforts			1
they are searching for new sources of fuel , chemicals and medicines , and providing security against mines and other hazards			0
@entity49 believes the drone has already transformed exploration and foresees rapid progress			1
" the more you use the more efficient they are because if you launch 50 you only use one ship -- which is the bulk of expense , " he says			0
" it 's a paradigm shift toward using large fleets for wider coverage and research			0
and the ( sensor ) technology gets better the more you use it			0
" the fleet is expanding steadily -- this summer saw the largest set of @entity102 yet probing the @entity104 ice to chart the effects of warming as well as to search for hydrocarbons			0
such capabilities have earned the company a growing list of conservation , fuel and military clients			0
the current @entity114 model is being upgraded to improve power storage , reliability and the sophistication of its algorithm , but experts believe the systems are already mature			0
" in the last 20 years these platforms gone from experimental one - offs to workhorses , " says @entity121 , professor of oceanography at @entity123 , who uses drones in research on oil spills			1
" we ca n't afford to go everywhere in manned submarines so these offer a greater range -- if submarines are like searching with a microscope , these are like satellites			0
" read this : electronic nose sniffs out cancer the @entity11 is " an important arrow in the quiver , " says @entity121 , as it offers valuable insights within its field but limited to the surface region			1
he would like to see its work combined with that of crafts such as the @entity151 , the deepest ranging autonomous vessel , from the @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , one of which was lost in may in the @entity155 10,000 meters deep			0
the fastest - growing applications in the field have been military and fuel , but @entity121 believes there are greater prizes on offer			0
" the important things are to measure co2 levels and acidification , the major indicators of the state of the ocean , " he says			1
" this is a huge question and the more observation we have in different parts of the ocean greatly improves our ability to measure it			0
" looking ahead , @entity11 is opening up its platforms to research institutions to develop new and improved sensors to create new fields of investigation			1
a more ambitious vision is to build on communication -- between drone and command center , but also between swarms of drones working together			1
beyond this , innovators in this field are seeking another level of information that combines the research of drones on the surface with drones on the sea bed , aerial drones and satellites in space			1
it has taken humanity until now to explore 5 % of the world 's oceans , but in the unmanned era we are making up for lost time			0

@entity214 drone survives *typhoon* and collects data from the center
@entity11 also used in monitoring acidification , and mine sweeping
development will *include* *collaboration* between drones above and below the water
