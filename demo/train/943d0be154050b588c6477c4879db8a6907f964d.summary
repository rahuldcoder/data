-- @entity1 is @entity2 's rebel writer who has become the unofficial voice for his generation			1
as a teenager the 27 - year - old began writing novels about angst - ridden characters that proved tremendously popular with @entity2 's angsty youth			2
but it is his blog that has propelled him to celebrity status in @entity2 and earned him the accolade as one of @entity17 's 100 most influential people of 2009			1
he 's been touted as mouthpiece for the " post- 80 's generation " ; @entity2 's youth who have grown up during the country 's economic boom and are often characterized as apolitical and consumer - obsessed			2
blogging about issues such as the @entity2 government 's handling of the @entity28 earthquake of 2008 and recent spate of school stabbings , @entity1 is savvy enough to know the limits of what he can and ca n't write about			1
" even though the @entity2 government has improved on the freedom of speech front in recent years , writing is still rather dangerous , so it 's quite difficult to strike this balance , " he told @entity0			0
" but i believe you still need to try despite these difficulties			0
the situation only improves when there are more people trying ; if no one is trying , it only gets more and more difficult			0
" with boyish good - looks and a rebel 's cred ( he dropped out of high - school and races rally cars ) he 's become one of @entity2 's more popular and recognizable bloggers , where the @entity52 is an increasingly popular forum for self - expression			1
for @entity56 , a @entity2 media commentator , @entity1 's attitude combined with his writing helps strike a chord with millions of @entity2 's disaffected youth			1
" what separates @entity1 from the other popular bloggers is , i think ... he 's got attitude			1
he is provocative and he reflects some of the anxieties that young people feel about the way @entity2 is today , " said @entity56			0
he may be outspoken but @entity1 is not an activist in the vein of human rights and freedom of speech campaigner @entity70 , who was jailed in 2009			1
coming from a different generation from @entity1 sees himself more aligned with artists rather than political iconoclasts			2
" i 'm not asking or requesting much -- i just hope that all the people in arts , all the literati , painters , and directors can work in an unregulated and uncensored environment , " he said			0
" but to be honest , the @entity2 government and @entity2 officials are n't as scary or as evil as what outsiders perceive			0
their thinking process is a bit old - fashioned and stupid , but not evil			0
except towards people who they believe might threaten the government , of course this relates mostly to many political events in the past			0
