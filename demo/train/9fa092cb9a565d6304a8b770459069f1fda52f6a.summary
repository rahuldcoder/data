@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 've survived the brutality of war , extreme poverty , religious and racial persecution			1
but here at a baseball field outside @entity16 , a group of giggling teenage girls from @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 have found a level playing ground			1
it 's around noon , time for physical education class at the @entity20 , a small private institution for refugee teenage girls who have little or no @entity24 education			1
the girls -- some wearing donated sneakers , others barefoot -- split into teams and take their positions			2
a girl with a scarf worn loosely around her long wavy brown hair is next up			0
she surveys the field and gets ready to kick			0
" kick the ball clear to @entity36 ! " shouts the coach			0
@entity37 laughs excitedly as she kicks the ball , then makes first base			0
@entity36 is where @entity37 , a 16 - year old @entity13 refugee , lived before arriving in the @entity40 three years ago			2
her family was forced to leave @entity13 because of " a lot of trouble " there , she says			0
with the help of a @entity40 government aid agency , @entity37 , her mother and two brothers resettled in @entity49 , about 14 miles outside @entity16			1
@entity49 is home to more than 6,000 refugees who make up a majority of the small suburb 's population , which is about 7,800 people , according to its mayor , @entity55			1
refugee families started streaming into @entity49 in the 1990s after federal officials found a large number of vacant apartment complexes there , he says			1
that 's still the case today			0
because of its affordable housing and access to public transportation , thousands of refugees from @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity11 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity14 ( formerly @entity14 ) now call this small rural enclave home			1
@entity55 says programs like the @entity20 help the entire community bridge the communication and culture gap			1
when @entity37 arrived in the @entity40 at age 13 , she could not understand or communicate in @entity24			0
she would have easily " fallen through the cracks " at a public school , says @entity87 , the @entity20 's academic director			1
" she has some difficulty learning but has made significant progress , " says @entity87 , who has worked closely with @entity37 to improve her @entity24 comprehension			0
@entity92 is one of a handful of full - time teachers at the @entity20			1
the school , which has an annual operating budget of $ 250,000 , survives solely on grants and donations and the help of volunteers			1
founders of the school saw a need to focus on teenage girls who would never be able to adapt at public school because of their lack of @entity24 skills			1
there was already a school for refugee boys in @entity49 -- the @entity112 , where @entity37 's brother is a student			1
like most of the other refugee students , @entity37 uses public transport to travel from her home in @entity49 to school , a trip that can take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes			1
despite the commute , she says she believes pursuing an education is a privilege			0
" when i come here i did n't understand anything , " says @entity37			0
" the school has a lot of respect for the student , " she says with a smile			2
new and prospective students to the @entity20 are assessed on their ability to communicate , as well as their reading skills			1
once accepted into the program , girls are placed in different levels of learning			2
some eventually go on to high school , while others can go on to receive their geds and apply for college			1
students are not only dealing with education and cultural barriers			2
many girls were forced to leave family members behind , or worse -- lost them to violence , sickness or war			2
@entity37 's classmates , sisters @entity149 , 18 , and @entity150 , 16 , arrived in the @entity40 with their older sister more than a year ago			0
their parents are still in their home country , @entity14			2
" sometimes when we talk , my mom ... she cries , " says @entity149			0
" they never told us if they are in danger , they do n't want us to be sad for them			0
" the girls never dwell on or analyze what they 've been through before arriving in the @entity40			2
@entity37 says she wants to go to college and become a journalist one day			2
but now , she stays focused on her studies and improving her @entity24			0
@entity149 , who likes to dress in the latest trends , says she 's interested in finding a career in the beauty industry			0
@entity150 says math and science are her favorite subjects , and she hopes to be a researcher one day			0
" in these cultures , everybody would be paralyzed if they thought about and talked about their past experiences , " says @entity87 .			0
