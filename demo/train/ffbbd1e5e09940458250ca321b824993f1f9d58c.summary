-- like what you 've seen so far ? well , the @entity3 will dish up even more soccer superlatives as the " @entity5 " kicks off on saturday			1
after surviving the " @entity8 , " the @entity7 soccer team will have to duck a knockout punch this week			1
with the complicated math of group play gone , the elimination principal will take to the pitch with the squads			0
that means it 's win or go home			2
@entity19 has to knock @entity20 out cold to advance to the quarterfinals			0
that 's not until tuesday			2
but wait ! leave that tv on ! @entity25 @entity7 footy fans should n't get tempted to take a break along with the home team they 've newly fallen in love with , or they 'll miss big games like @entity31 vs. @entity32 on sunday -- and the ultimate futbol acrobats on saturday : they 're the beauty in the " beautiful game , " the big kahuna , the unmatched five - time @entity3 champions , the team sportscasters call " @entity39 " -- that has proven that soccer can be better than you - know - what : @entity43			1
here are this weekend 's four knockout matches with viewing times and channels -- and at bottom , a fun way to find a love match and score yourself at the cup			1
" @entity39 " @entity43 vs. @entity52 , noon et saturday on @entity53 , @entity54 despite the home field advantage , the @entity57 team is getting the jitters as rival @entity52 approaches , @entity43 's coach told the @entity61			1
but that 's " normal , " he said			2
it does n't seem to calm their nerves that @entity66 ranks @entity52 's team 14th and @entity43 's 3rd in the world			1
-- or that @entity43 has won 48 of the two teams ' 68 previous face - offs			1
-- or that it scored 159 goals vs. 58 for @entity52 in those matches			2
-- or that @entity43 has shot seven goals in this tournament so far to @entity52 's five			1
-- or that @entity43 has fired 23 shots on target at the goal at this @entity3 compared to 10 for @entity52			1
@entity66 ranked @entity81 no. 1 , and they 've already gone home			0
if @entity52 gets just one more point than @entity43 -- just the right ankle - breaking dance to the goal by maestro forward @entity86 -- or if their impenetrable goalie @entity87 holds off one last goal attempt by @entity43			1
then @entity43 goes home , too			1
er , uh , wait			0
but they 'd have to sit in the stands in front of the whole country without that sixth championship star on their jerseys			0
the bite @entity100 vs. @entity101 , 4 p.m. et saturday on @entity53 , @entity54 it 's almost like @entity100 never lost star striker @entity103 to injury even before the cup started			0
they ate up their competitors in @entity109 play and go to the knockout round euphoric			0
and at the same time , @entity101 literally lost a lot of its bite this week when @entity66 suspended forward @entity113 for four months for ... well ... biting another player			0
he 's a massive scorer -- saved his team after it lost to @entity116 3 - 1 in @entity118 play			1
he shot both goals , when @entity101 downed @entity120 2 - 1			0
@entity101 's team is raving mad at @entity66 for sending @entity113 home			1
maybe it will give the team the fire in the belly it needs to keep from joining him at @entity100 's hands			2
in their previous matchups , @entity101 has come out on top much more often			0
and they 've still got forward @entity133 , whom @entity66 calls " a born goalscorer			0
" and he has a reputation for being much more laid back than @entity113			0
sports clothier @entity137 has had some fun with the infamous chomp			0
big cheese or whole enchilada @entity32 vs. @entity31 , noon et sunday , @entity142 , @entity54 call it @entity144			1
the @entity32 are to @entity145 what @entity146 is to the @entity7 in its clich√©d role as a cheese maker -- although in reality , the @entity150 says @entity152 and @entity153 make more of it			1
but @entity32 has the stuff to be the big cheese of global soccer this year			1
the guys in screaming orange jerseys have shot the most goals in this year 's @entity3 -- 10 , compared to the top two seeds -- @entity152 's and @entity43 -- which have seven each			1
they dominated their group , roundly stomping reigning world champ @entity81 5 - 1 in their first game			0
@entity31 has played more defense than offense , scoring only four goals so far but also allowing only one			1
they held @entity43 to a 0 - 0 tie			2
but @entity31 may have just turned up the heat			2
it looks like their scoring hope @entity176 just got cranked in their 3 - 1 win against @entity179			0
if they beat the @entity182 , they would reach the level of their best ever performance at the @entity3			2
they 've only previously made it to the group of eight twice before			0
now , please , go home ! @entity116 vs. @entity191 , 4 p.m. et sunday , @entity142 , @entity54 they 've never met on a @entity3 pitch before			2
and it 's no wonder			0
this is only @entity116 's third appearance at a @entity3 , and only @entity191 's second			1
@entity191 has shot only two goals so far this tournament but also allowed only one			0
@entity116 has shot twice as many , while allowing only one and putting away major contenders @entity201 and @entity101			0
sound like @entity191 is the underdog ? consider that @entity66 ranks the team 12th in the world and @entity116 28th			0
remember many good things come from @entity191 , even if they are from @entity43 : 5			2
scoring apps no , no , not apps to keep score of the game			1
apps to find the right match -- as in people to date			2
@entity212 and @entity213 are dating apps for smart phones , and they 're booming in @entity43 at the @entity3			1
with more than 600,000 fans pouring into @entity43 for the tournament , @entity212 says usage and downloads here have jumped 50 %			2
many locals are using it to meet visitors from around the world			0
at bars and open - air fan game viewing sites , people are checking their smart phones to see how many new matches they have -- and the apps turn up plenty of people to meet			1
maybe with a particular goal in mind ? --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- @entity0 's @entity236 and @entity237 contributed to this report			0
