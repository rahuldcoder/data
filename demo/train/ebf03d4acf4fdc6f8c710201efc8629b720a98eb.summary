-- minors under 17 will be prohibited from using commercial tanning beds in @entity3 , and those under 14 will be banned from spray - tanning procedures in tanning facilities , under a new law signed by gov. @entity8			1
in remarks made at the time he signed the bill monday , @entity8 noted that @entity3 already banned those under 14 from using tanning facilities			2
but , he said , " the new restrictions imposed by this bill followed a single , but breathlessly reported , incident of a parent bringing a minor child into a tanning facility			0
" in february , a @entity3 grand jury declined to indict a woman accused of child endangerment for allegedly allowing her 5 - year - old daughter to use a tanning bed , resulting in leg burns			1
@entity28 was arrested in april 2012 after school officials noticed burns on the girl 's legs and reported the injuries			0
prosecutors accused her of allowing her daughter inside a stand - up tanning booth at a salon in the northern @entity3 town of @entity40			1
@entity8 said monday the child was not permanently injured and the salon was fined by the state @entity42			0
" confidence in the current laws , rather than a rush to add new and perhaps unnecessary provisions , would have seemed the appropriate legislative response , " the governor said			0
" nonetheless , i sign this bill because of the documented and well - understood risks associated with misuse of indoor tanning systems			1
" @entity54 and @entity55 have also banned indoor tanning for minors , according to the @entity58			1
@entity59 also prohibits indoor tanning for those under age 16			2
a handful of other states , including @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , require parental permission			0
indoor tanning exposes users to both uv - a and uv - b rays , which cause skin damage and can cause cancer , according to the @entity77			1
indoor tanning can be particularly dangerous for young users ; research has shown that those who begin tanning before age 35 have a 75 % higher risk of melanoma			2
the @entity84 , however , criticized the new law , saying it would only drive teens to " riskier alternatives like home units and beaches			0
" in a statement , the association said it was " disappointed that gov. @entity8 and the @entity3 legislature have decided that government should have more of a say in teenagers ' lives than their parents , " and notes it has " worked diligently to offer a compromise including stricter regulations , more enforcement and fines and greater parental control			0
