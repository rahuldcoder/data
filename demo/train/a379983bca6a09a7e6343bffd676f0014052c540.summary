-- some of the world 's oldest and rarest bibles and biblical texts were placed online tuesday in newly digitized form by two of the world 's most venerable libraries			1
the project , which aims to make 1.5 million pages of ancient texts freely available in virtual form over the next three years , is a joint effort by the @entity13 at @entity14 and the @entity15			1
the project is focused on three main areas : ancient @entity19 manuscripts , @entity21 manuscripts and 15th - century printed books , known as incunabula			1
they will include secular and religious texts			1
for its online launch , however , the organizers have highlighted a smaller group of bibles and biblical commentaries , each of which has been chosen for its particular historical importance			2
they include a copy of a @entity35 , the first major book printed with moveable metal type in the western world , and the beautiful woodcuts of a @entity35 printed in 1478 - 1479 in @entity39 , known as @entity40			1
the four - year project , which began in 2012 , is funded by a 2 million pound ( nearly $ 3.3 million ) award from the @entity44 , a charity that supports higher education and research			0
dr. @entity50 , in a video clip posted on the project 's website , said that it would ensure that fragile texts that " should be part of the inheritance of mankind " were safeguarded for future generations			1
" it 's too dangerous to have unique exemplars of anything in one place , " he said			0
" digitizing enables us to secure all of this material and of course make it broadly available			0
it 's an opportunity you ca n't resist			0
" the archbishop of @entity68 , @entity69 , said , " where you can see these actual texts there is just a lifting of the spirit , something that inspires worship			0
" the project is of " huge international significance , " he said , because a far wider range of scholars than before will now be able to see the texts			2
conservation staff at the @entity13 and @entity15 libraries have worked together to ensure the ancient documents are not exposed to any harm in the digitization process , a news release from the @entity13 said			1
scholars will be able to zoom in on texts and images to study them more closely			0
" i envision how useful it will be to scholars and many other interested people , " monsignor @entity91 , the prefect of the @entity15 , is quoted as saying			2
" moreover , i see the common fruit of our labor as a very positive sign of collaboration and sharing that is a trademark of the world of culture			0
" rare @entity104 book sells for $ 14.2 million			0
