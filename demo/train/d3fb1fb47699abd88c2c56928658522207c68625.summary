@entity14 was the history - making donor , and @entity17 was the recipient			1
his wife , @entity19 , in return donated one of her kidneys to a patient in @entity23 , @entity24			1
the announcement of the first intercontinental organ exchange was made at a news conference held at the @entity28 in @entity0			1

" the opportunity to help change someone 's life , in itself , would be an honor but to potentially change the world -- it 's huge , " she said , " i felt that ... a month of surgery and recovery in order to help give someone else life was completely worth it			0
" before @entity14 could get the opportunity , though , @entity5 law had to be changed to allow the exchange			1
@entity5 's transplant law -- intended to prevent black market organ harvesting -- stated that only a first or second relative could donate a kidney			1
@entity19 , whose husband was in desperate need of a kidney transplant , spearheaded the efforts to change the law			0
after meeting with various officials and ministers , @entity17 family attorney @entity74 said they " understood what could be done			0

four months later , she returned to donate her kidney to a @entity24 man -- a chain started by a practice called " kidney pair donation			1

" so instead , they 're willing to give a stranger a kidney so that another stranger can give their loved one a kidney			2
" " as a donor i feel very well and i 'm very calm , " @entity19 , who attended friday 's news conference with her husband via @entity108 , said through a translator			0
" every day that i see @entity17 well i 'm very happy			0
and every day i think of @entity112 , and i think of the person that received my kidney , mr. @entity111 and i wonder how he 's doing , how he 's feeling every day			2
" " it 's just been fabulous			0
everything is working good , " @entity111 responded , " i feel the best i 've felt in a couple years			0
