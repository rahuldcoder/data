-- raise your hand if this has ever happened to you : you wake up bleary - eyed on a weekday morn , lazily scroll through your newsfeed or @entity7 feed or @entity9 reader or whatever medium you use to absorb small bits of inanity , and there it is -- an opinionated update on a season finale , new movie or hot book , filled with important plot points			1
@entity20 ! you 've been struck by a spoiler			0
times have changed since 76.3 million @entity23 tuned in to the disappointing series finale of " @entity25			0
" as one , they turned their gazes to their television sets , letting out a slow exhale as the final credits rolled			0
nowadays , fewer and fewer people are catching programs at their air time			1
in 2012 , 36 % more people watched tv on their smartphones than in 2011 , according to a report from @entity39			1
and @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and streaming services let us mold tv schedules into our own lives			1
which is all to say : you can not assume , just because you 've seen something , that everyone else has , you arrogant jerk			0
your friends should n't have to creep around with their fingers in their ears screeching , " do n't tell me ; i have n't seen it yet ! " if you simply must pontificate on a cultural reference point with surprises , twists or big reveals , bear the following in mind			1
simple : just put " @entity65 " at the beginning of the write - up			1
bonus points if you place the big plot - pivotal announcement after a jump ( on a blog ) or after a few hard enters on @entity73 ( so readers have to click " see more " to read the rest )			1
remember : hints are spoilers , too			1
if people want clues as to how the tale will end , they will ask			1
ninety - nine percent of the time , they 'll want to finish it unbiased , draw their own conclusions and then discuss			1
hot tip : saying anything to the effect of " there is a huge twist at @entity92 , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is " is indeed a spoiler , because the viewer / reader will now follow the entire tale expecting the unexpected			0
just keep your mouth shut until they 've finished , yes ? 3			0
favor exclusive discussions over blasted proclamations			0
all 483 of your @entity73 friends do not care what you thought of the moment in " girls " when we learn @entity111 is an illegal alien			1
( spoiler alert : @entity111 is not an illegal alien			0
) guess what ! you can even use social media to bring to you those who are equally eager to discuss @entity118 's untimely death			0
( spoiler alert : @entity118 is n't dead			2
) simply make your chat status something like " must begin discussing the end of ' brave ' posthaste			0
who 's seen it ? " and then squawk away without ruining anyone else 's experience			0
give it the three - year test			1
has the @entity129 made three or more trips around the sun since the book / movie / show / play had its day ? then all bets are off			2
those who still have n't seen " @entity135 " by now are unlikely to get around to it			2
ok , so your jerk friend just posted about the shocking moment in " @entity141 " when we realize the whole trilogy is the fever dream of a koala who watched his friends get taxidermied			2
( spoiler alert : oh , please			0
) take heart : research from @entity150 reports that spoilers actually enhance enjoyment			2
scientists found that students had more fun reading narratives when they knew the plot twist ahead of time than when they just learned it at the end , likely because it helped them pick up subtle clues along the way			1
( that 's the reason everyone saw " @entity164 " at least twice			0
) in case you have n't seen it , @entity166 ' character ... is a ghost himself ! you 're welcome ! hey , do n't blame us			2
that movie came out waaay more than three years ago .			0

do n't spoil tv or movie plot twists *online* for your friends
nowadays , fewer and fewer people are catching programs at their air time
