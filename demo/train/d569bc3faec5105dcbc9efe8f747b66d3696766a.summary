-- @entity2 ' hopes of becoming the first disabled athlete to compete at the @entity4 appear to be over after the man known as the " @entity2 " failed to qualify for @entity4			1
the 25 - year - old will defend his three @entity8 titles in the @entity10 capital in august , but he was not able to achieve the required 400 meters time for the able - bodied event at the @entity12 on friday			1
his only hope is earning a place in @entity16 's 4x400m relay squad , having clocked 45.52 seconds in finishing second in the final in @entity18 -- outside the 45.30 he needed to pass for a second time this season			1
@entity23 's @entity22 won in 45.25 , with @entity2 ' compatriot @entity24 third in 45.67			2
" i am obviously disappointed that my time was just outside of the @entity29 qualification time by two tenths of a second , " said @entity2 , who timed 45.20 at the @entity26 on march 17			2
" i had felt very strong coming into this competition as my fitness and speed has been continually improving			0
i was in good shape to set the time and believe my speed will only increase over the next few weeks			0
@entity2 's @entity29 ambition " i had a great early start to the season , setting the @entity29 qualification time and i am hoping that there is still the opportunity for me to be selected to run for @entity16 in the 4x400m relay			1
" @entity2 made history when he competed at the @entity47 in @entity48 , reaching the 400m semifinals and then helping @entity16 reach the final of the relay			1
he was omitted from the final , but received a medal for his earlier efforts when the team won silver			0
it represented a major breakthrough for @entity2 , who had to take legal action after athletics ' ruling body the @entity63 banned him from able - bodied competition six months before the @entity65			2
born without fibula in both legs , he had double amputations as a child and needs carbon - fiber prosthetic limbs to race			0
the @entity63 ruled that the blades gave him an unfair advantage , but he overturned that ruling -- though not in time for him to qualify for @entity75			0
@entity2 did compete in the subsequent @entity8 event , winning gold in the 100 , 200 and 400m .			0

@entity16 's ' @entity2 ' fails to set qualifying time for @entity4
the 25 - year - old falls short in 400 meters at @entity12 , finishing second
he beat the qualifying time earlier this season but needed to do it twice to win a place
@entity2 still hopes to be selected for @entity16 's 4x400m relay team
