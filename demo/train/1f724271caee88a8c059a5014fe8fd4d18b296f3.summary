in @entity9 's @entity8 , on the outskirts of @entity1 , towering green stalks of the famously versatile plant sway in the wind , creaking eerily they collide and twist , leaves rustling			1
the sun filters through the densely packed grove , projecting thin slashes of light onto the dozens of camera - clutching tourists shuffling down the wide trail that cuts through the middle of the forest as they awkwardly angle their shots , attempting to crop human forms out of their frames			2
long gone are the days when you 'd get this place to yourself			0
if you 've ever clicked on a rundown of " places to see before you die " or a compilation of the most beautiful forests in the world , chances are you 've seen a photo of @entity35			1
located in the gorgeous @entity38 district of western @entity1 , the @entity8 's popularity has expanded in recent years , coinciding with the growing number of @entity41 articles that include it on superlative - heavy travel lists			1
though it 's the beauty of the bamboo that brings in the masses , those distinct rustling sounds have become an attraction in their own right			1
a few years ago the @entity50 included the @entity8 on its list of " @entity52 " -- a selection of everyday noises intended to encourage locals to stop and enjoy nature 's music			1
for the best experience , head out early in the morning or late evening and avoid weekends completely , when @entity9 day - trippers descend on the area -- especially in the fall and spring			0
( there 's no admission fee and it 's open 24/7			1

in @entity9 , @entity79 shrines and @entity81 temples are often situated near bamboo groves , which are viewed as a clever means of warding off evil , while the bamboo is seen as a symbol of strength			2
built in the 14th century by a shogun in honor of the passing of @entity9 's emperor , @entity72 has one of the country 's most incredible @entity94 gardens and is today the headquarters of the @entity97 of @entity94			1

a massive complex of gardens with plants and trees that are famed for catering to all four seasons , there 's also a temple , study , tea hut and museum highlighting the life of @entity103			2
exploring @entity8 the bamboo forest and its bookend attractions of @entity72 and @entity100 may be the stars of the area for international tourism crowds , but the entire @entity38 district is worth exploring			1
with its low - lying tree - covered mountains that tumble into the @entity126 , historic temples and charming streets , @entity8 has been designated a @entity127 and @entity128 by @entity9			1
it 's been attracting moneyed locals since the 8th century , when vacationing aristocratic families visited to check out the changing seasons ' colors and go boating on the @entity126			2
today , one of the top ways to enjoy the natural beauty of the area is by hopping on the @entity139 -- also known as the @entity140			2

the area 's main icon , however , is the @entity167 ( @entity168 ) , which flows over the @entity126			2
built during @entity9 's @entity170 ( 794 - 1185 ) , when @entity75 was @entity9 's capital , it was reconstructed in the 1930s			1
here , @entity9 tourists can be seen posing for photos while dressed in colorful kimonos -- a nod to @entity75 's status as the cultural capital of @entity9			1
after all that touring , a pit stop at one of the many soft - serve ice cream stands is a fine way to end the day -- the vanilla / green tea twists are particularly addictive			0
@entity8 sidetracks the @entity186 crowds can get annoying , but the fantastic @entity187 is oddly overlooked by most tourists as it 's a bit more remote than most of the district 's attractions			1
about a 30 - minute walk from the @entity8 , it features over 1,000 little stone rakan ( statues of enlightened ones ) made from 1981 to 1991 during the reconstruction of the temple			1
most pose serenely , covered in a green layer of moss			0
the odd one holds a tennis racket			0
on weekdays , the lovely uphill walk from the @entity8 to @entity205 is also surprisingly tourist - free yet full of unique gift shops -- including one owned by an artist who creates his works out of silk worm cocoons -- a massive traditional torii gate , tea rooms and private residences			1
if the kids are crying out for something a bit more lively , up on @entity38 sits the @entity216 , home to some 100 @entity9 macaques			0
what 's cool about this place is that it 's the humans who are in the cage , and the monkeys -- which you can feed -- on the outside			2
