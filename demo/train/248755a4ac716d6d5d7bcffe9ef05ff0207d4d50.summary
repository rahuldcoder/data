fast cars , fast women and fast on their way to court -- it would seem some footballers are renowned as much for their pace on the pitch as for flouting the rules when it comes to the need to speed			0
new @entity12 manager @entity11 might be known as the engineer , but he will want to put the brakes on his players getting behind the wheel			1
@entity17 , who completed his move from @entity12 to @entity19 last week , was just one player to feel the force of the law after being found guilty of committing motoring offenses			1
in april of this year , the @entity23 was fined about $ 1,500 and told to carry out 250 hours of community service after being found guilty of driving while disqualified and without insurance			2
@entity17 's former teammate , @entity26 , was also banned from driving for six months and fined $ 3,180 after being caught on camera exceeding the speed limit three times in 2011			1
defender @entity30 became the third @entity12 defender to be banned when his license was suspended for six months after failing to respond to two speeding notices			1
and it 's not just the @entity12 car pool that has had problems with that thirst for speed			1
@entity39 in february , @entity41 forward @entity39 car was clocked on a @entity41 highway driving at 216 kilometers per hour -- more than double the legal limit			2
the @entity44 , who was driving an @entity45 , which is the official car sponsor of @entity41 , was banned for eight months and fined nearly $ 23,000			1
it came after a june 2011 incident where @entity39 was fined for racing in downtown @entity49			0
in april , @entity51 's @entity50 was banned from driving for 12 months after clocking up 39 penalty points -- 27 more than the usual limit of 12 that would get a player banned			1
car sponsors are an essential aspect of the football industry but given the place footballers occupy in the hearts and minds -- and more importantly the wallets -- of the sport 's paying customers it 's unlikely that relationship will be ending anytime soon			2
" football is the sport that cuts through to by far the largest number of people around the world , " a spokeswoman for @entity45 , which runs sponsorship deals with @entity68 , @entity41 , @entity69 and @entity70 , told @entity71			1
" our experience based on our commitments with the top class @entity81 clubs tells us that there is major business potential for @entity45 within this sporting environment , both on a business - to - business footing and with consumers , i.e. the fans			1
" together with the teams we are conducting international activities not only in @entity81 but also in @entity91			0
" big business it is not difficult to understand why @entity45 has forged such a close relationship with a number of leading teams in @entity81			1
" the best example of this ' internationalization ' is the @entity99 , which has been a resounding success both in terms of quantity and quality , " added the @entity45 spokeswoman			1
" the 2011 competition was staged in @entity105 , and was broadcast in 180 countries , achieving more than one billion exposures during the pre-event and post-event coverage period			0
" while the commercial gains are obvious , the company was also keen to point out that it would take " necessary constructive action " if players were found guilty of breaking motoring rules			1
" @entity45 has sponsorship agreements with various associations and teams , " added the spokeswoman			1
" many of these agreements also contain clauses concerning the provision of @entity45 vehicles			1
" of course , we work on the basis that all the drivers of these @entity45 vehicles will comply with existing traffic regulations			1
" if this proves not to be the case , it is the responsibility of the association or team management to take the necessary corrective action			2
" aura of invincibility ? but it is not always easy to comply with existing traffic regulations when you have an " aura of untouchability			2
" " players have absorbed this and , as if by osmosis , have begun to believe they are above reproach , " @entity140 , professor of culture , media and sport at @entity144 in the @entity145 , told @entity71			1
" every day , they are surrounded by evidence of their immaculate status , whether in the media , or in restaurants and bars , or even just when they turn up for training where there 's usually an assembly of adoring fans and obsequious journalists			0
" footballers are only doing what the likes of you , me and other consumers do all the time -- buy products that confer value on them			0
" fans buy trainers , shirts , or dogs			0
( yes , dogs are commodities nowadays ) , other people buy designer clothes , homes in desirable areas and , of course , cars			0
" when it comes to vehicles , added @entity184 : " footballers buy even more expensive cars , which tend to be faster , so tickets for speeding and parking are , in practical terms , irrelevant			0
" we are all part of the same process -- buying visible status			0
the difference is that footballers can afford more and want their status to be not just visible but ostentatiously visible			0
" it 's not just players either -- managers have also been in trouble , with @entity70 boss @entity201 famously being absolved of any wrongdoing in october 1999 after claiming he had severe diarrhoea and needed to reach a toilet after speeding down the highway			2
@entity206 @entity206 was another to escape after winning an appeal against his eight - month driving ban in december 1999			2
@entity206 claimed he was trying to escape a paparazzi photographer when his @entity210 was clocked at 122 km / h in an 80 km / h zone			0
according to the judge , there were " special circumstances " which had caused @entity206 to break the speed limit			2
both @entity201 and @entity206 were represented by attorney @entity216 , a man who has been nicknamed " mr loophole " after successfully getting his clients off the hook			0
@entity216 has represented golfer @entity220 , singer @entity221 and countless other celebrities during his time working in the business			0
but other football stars have n't been so lucky : the likes of @entity227 and @entity228 have also felt the force of the authorities , with both men being handed bans from driving			1
and @entity41 star @entity233 survived a high - speed crash in january 2011 after smashing his $ 303,000 @entity210 against a @entity236 tunnel when he was playing for @entity70			0
@entity237 and then there 's that man , @entity240 " why always me ? " @entity237 , who crashed his @entity241 last april in a collision with another car			0
@entity237 , who now plays in @entity244 with @entity69 , paid out nearly $ 15,000 in parking fines and had his white @entity246 impounded just the 27 times during his spell at @entity12			1
and while car sponsors continue to queue up to sign marketing deals with football clubs , others within the motor industry remain concerned about the impact players flouting the law has			1
" it does n't help having someone who can have cars at the higher end of the market who is ignoring the law , " @entity256 , editor of @entity257 , told @entity71			2
" i was surprised that @entity17 was n't given a custodial sentence and the judge did n't make an example of him			0
" @entity256 adds , however , that it 's not a new phenomenon ; footballers and cars have had this relationship going back to the 1970s			0
" @entity273 players are very rich young men who have a penchant for buying nice shiny cars and have a reputation for buying the most expensive			2
they 're high powered and high performance cars and there will be occasions when they go too fast			0
" unfortunately , it 's unlikely that footballers are about to change their way			0
according to a survey taken in february 2011 by @entity291 insurance firm @entity290 , professional football players " are the drivers most likely to have points on their driving license for committing offenses such as speeding , running red lights and using a phone whilst driving			1
" after consulting data from more than over three million motorists in the @entity291 , research showed that almost a third of football players have points on their license			1
temptation elephant.co.uk managing director , @entity301 , said at the time , " powerful cars are closely associated with the footballers ' lifestyle so perhaps for some of them the temptation to speed is simply too much			0
" with wages at the top level still rising and punishments such as that handed out to @entity17 unlikely to act as a deterrent , life in the fast lane looks set to continue for a while longer			0
but perhaps a sobering thought might give some football players a reason to pause and think			1
@entity317 had the world at his feet after joining @entity12			1
now , at the age of 18 , he is serving a 16 - month sentence after being found guilty of causing the deaths of two people in a car crash			0
he admitted to causing their death by careless driving and was banned from driving for three years			2
footballers may have a need for speed -- but the speed of thought might be more useful next time they consider flouting the law .			0

@entity12 have had three players banned for driving offenses since start of 2013
survey shows almost a third of football players in @entity291 have points on license
" players believe they are beyond reproach " when it comes to traffic laws
@entity45 says it will take action if players break law while driving its brand of vehicle
