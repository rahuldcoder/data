-- some subjects are just plain hard to talk about			0
religion , politics and money -- maybe sex , too			0
but try talking about race and then add the emotional context of a death penalty trial , and no one will talk at all			1
if you try to broach the subject during jury selection , asking all the racists to please raise their hands is not an option			1
we , as a nation , have to find a way to face the dirty secret of criminal justice -- that prejudice often carries the day			0
the issue of racial disparity in the administration of the death penalty has been a part of modern law			1
starting with @entity29 and continuing on to @entity30 v. @entity31 , courts have struggled to come to grips with this issue as have those of us defending the most despised amongst us			0
jury selection is actually a process of elimination : potential jurors are called for jury duty and are questioned and either seated , excused for a cause or excused by a peremptory challenge from either side			1
generally , a challenge for cause involves jurors who have a relationship with a party or witness , have a personal experience that would cause them to be unfair or are legally unable to sit			0
in capital cases , the number of potential jurors who can be excluded for cause is much larger because anyone who is against the death penalty can be turned away -- and minorities are more likely to find problems with the death penalty			1
then there 's the misuse of peremptory challenges -- each side gets a certain number of these that it can use to excuse a juror for any reason			2
the prosecution often uses this strategy to strike as many minorities from serving as jurors as it can			2
the problem this creates is obvious			0
a black or @entity72 defendant facing death is the most likely to have an all , or nearly all , white jury			1
to combat this , the @entity76 @entity75 in @entity77 v. @entity78 held that the defense could object if it believed the prosecution was using its peremptory challenges to limit the number of minority jurors			1
if the trial judge so ordered , the prosecution would then be obliged to give " race - neutral " reasons for the exclusions			1
if the trial court accepted these explanations , the trial would continue			0
if not , a mistrial would be declared			0
this procedure was supposed to fix the problem			0
it has n't had that effect			0
almost any excuse will do -- a prosecutor can call the juror " arrogant " for example , and that is enough			0
in one case i tried , the prosecution excused a black woman who was married , a homeowner , had two children and taught elementary school			2
they kept a white woman who was married , a homeowner , had three children and taught elementary school			2
his " race - neutral " explanation ? the black woman wore her dress too tight			1
and the judge accepted that explanation			2
obviously , prosecutors know that this form of discrimination increases their odds of winning , and the desire to win is hard to resist			1
but a prosecutor is supposed to represent the people of his or her state or the federal government , and that includes not only the victim and his or her family , and public safety , but the accused and the community			0
systematic exclusion of a race from jury selection sends an ugly message -- @entity140 and @entity141 need not apply			1
in an analysis of @entity144 , the @entity142 found that from 1999 to 2007 , blacks were struck from juries at more than three times the rate of whites			0
the @entity149 of @entity150 has just issued a report , " @entity152 : a @entity153 , " that details racial discrimination in jury selection in eight @entity158 states			1
" key decision makers in death - penalty cases across the country are almost exclusively white , " the @entity149 said			1
then there is the case of @entity164 , as reported by @entity0			0
he is about to be tried for the sixth time for the same crime in a case marred by racial discrimination in jury selection			1
we might think in this supposed " post-racial " world we are past discrimination , but we are n't			2
not by a long shot			0
confronting racial attitudes in the courtroom is often necessary			2
when a lawyer speaks up about these issues , he or she is inviting anger from the prosecution , potentially the judge and maybe even the jury			1
but we have to talk about this -- and by " we " i mean not only defense lawyers , but all of us -- and openly			2
the courts have to stop glossing over the problem by pretending that " race - neutral " reasons really exist or are even close to satisfactory			1
and courts should name the offending parties			0
the prosecutor who said he did n't want the teacher on the jury because of her so - called tight dress might have hesitated if he knew his name could be published			1
in one case i tried , the complaining witness was white , the defendant black , and race was all over the case			1
i was afraid to talk about it , but i believed it was a motivating force behind the choice to prosecute at all			0
so i took a deep breath and spoke			0
the jurors acquitted and thanked me for giving them permission to speak about race -- so they could talk about it and then move on and be able to " get to the case			2
" it 's time we all did the same			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			2

@entity220 : racial discrimination in jury selection *frequent* in death penalty cases
@entity227 : prosecutors use challenges to keep as many minorities off as possible
when defense objects , she says , judge often accepts lame " race - neutral " excuses
@entity220 says black or @entity141 facing death is the most likely to have all , or nearly all , white jury
