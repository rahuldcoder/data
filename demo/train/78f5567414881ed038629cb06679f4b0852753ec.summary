-- if you think school starts too early , you are n't the only one			0
a new policy statement published by the @entity5 is on the side of groggy students falling asleep at their desks and their parents who are tired of nagging them to get out of bed in the morning			1
they say that lack of sleep in adolescents causes poor academic performance and poses a serious public health concern			2
traffic accidents , depression and obesity can result , with schools that start too early contributing to the problem			1
the technical report released with the policy statement says that sleep - deprived teens tend to eat more carbohydrates and fats , with every hour of sleep that is lost increasing the odds of obesity by 80 %			1
adolescents that go to sleep at midnight or later are also more likely to suffer from depression and have suicidal thoughts			2
on the other hand , middle and high schools that start later in the day tend to have students with less daytime sleepiness , less tardiness , fewer attention difficulties and better academic performance than early - starting schools			1
sleep deprivation linked to depression in teens even if you do n't have children in school , you might still be impacted if you drive to work			1
one community in @entity54 , @entity55 , decreased the average crash rate for teenaged drivers by 16.5 % after delaying high school start times by one hour , according to a study published in the @entity60			2
and a two - year study of two high schools in @entity63 found that the school with the later start time had significantly fewer students in accidents			1
fatal wrecks underscore risks for young drivers to reduce these public health concerns , the @entity5 policy statement recommends that schools start no earlier than 8:30 a.m. only 14 % of public high schools currently meet this guideline , according to the @entity76			1
" i 'm hoping that the visibility of the sleep deprivation issue and research can help spark more discussion , " said @entity77 , co-founder and president of the @entity79 and former @entity80 @entity82 deputy assistant secretary			2
when the topic of later school start times arises , parents and school administrators often express concerns over work conflicts -- how can i drop my kid off at 9 if i have to be at the office at 8:30 ? -- and after - school activities			1

" it 's one more example of how are schools need to be student centered , " @entity103 argued			0
" there are thousands of children , bus schedules , lunch schedules , parent needs			0
but we have to focus on how we are going to help our children succeed			0
and making sure they have enough sleep is one of those things			0
" the @entity5 recommends that adolescents get 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep per night , which parents can help enforce by setting bedtimes and limiting their child 's use of electronic devices and social media in bed			1
" avoid keeping screens such as computers or tvs in your child 's bedroom , and keep portable ones ( phones , tablets , handheld games ) out as much as possible , " said dr. @entity127 , a board - certified pediatrician in @entity128			0
" it can be helpful to have a central charging station where all of the family 's electronics spend the night			0
" she adds that parents can also encourage sleep routines such as reading before bed and avoid scheduling music lessons , sports and social events that might delay bedtime			2
are your kids getting enough sleep ? " setting the stage for good sleep now is an important habit that can make a difference in your child 's future health , " @entity127 said			0
