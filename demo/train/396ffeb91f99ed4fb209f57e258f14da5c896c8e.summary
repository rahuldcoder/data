-- the @entity1 is nearly under way , but do n't expect an e-mail from the @entity4 asking you personal questions in its head count of @entity9			1
cyber criminals have information about millions of people , but they do n't use it against everyone			1
if you do get one , it 's a scam			0
" like most large organizations , we have seen e-mail scams and phishing attacks that cite the @entity4 , " agency spokesman @entity16 wrote in an e-mail			0
the @entity4 stresses that it will not request personal information from you via e-mail , such as pin codes , passwords , @entity28 numbers , credit - card numbers or other financial account information			1
a news - based phishing scheme like this one is one of several risks you face online			0
cybercriminals have gotten craftier , often looking toward popular trends and events -- such as tax season , the mortgage meltdown and the growth of social media -- to scam people into giving them sensitive information			1
to protect their privacy online , computer users need to stay informed about the criminals ' methods and to learn basic principles of caution			1
online attackers have information on millions of consumers , said @entity54 , a professor of cyber security at the @entity56 at @entity57			1
however , he added , the rate at which they can use that information is considerably lower			2
" it 's a bit like a lottery			0
to have identity theft actually occur against you , you need to have a little bad luck			0
there is some comfort in numbers , " @entity54 said			0
in addition to criminal scams , corporate data breaches can leave your privacy compromised			1
as of september 22 , there have been 379 data breaches reported by the @entity76 in 2009 , affecting more than 13 million records			2
companies with data breaches included financial institutions , travel companies , health care operations and schools			2
" it 's not one or two companies that are acting irresponsibly with consumer data , " said @entity84 , a law professor who teaches technology regulation at the @entity86 at the @entity87			2
" it 's a large - scale problem where industry norms of care are arguably not adequate to address the challenges of data security optimally			2
" safeguard your @entity28 number exercising caution before you submit sensitive information can save you a lot of aggravation down the line			1
for instance , most businesses really wo n't need your @entity28 number , the key number for identity theft , so think twice before you provide it online			1
@entity28 numbers are used " to establish new lines of credit or for tax purposes			1
how many things are you doing online that have to do with taxes ? " said @entity113 , co-founder of the @entity76			0
so before you share the information , be certain that you are on that web site of a real company -- as opposed to an imposter conducting a phishing scheme			1
also , ask yourself why a web site would need your social security number , said @entity124 , executive director of the @entity125			2
" i always encourage consumers to supply the minimum amount of information possible			2
a lot of times , you get these long forms and you get the little star that 's required , but people are collecting other [ data about you ] , " @entity124 said			1
" do n't fill it out if you do n't want to			2
" still , even visiting a legitimate web site has its share of risks , because online attackers may inject malicious content onto them by hacking them or placing advertisements that deliver malware , @entity54 said			2
if a criminal does obtain your social security number and creates a fraudulent identity , it can be a much bigger hassle than if he or she uses your credit card number			0
credit card companies often pick up the tab for fraudulent charges , and they send you a new card with a different number			0
it 's more difficult to get a new social security number , and a stolen identity could affect your credit rating			0
where is your information going ? if you conduct an online transaction that requires you to reveal personal data , the online privacy policy will explain whether your information could be shared with third parties			1
a company may tell you in that policy it will share your data with its " trusted partners " and however it deems appropriate in the course of business , said @entity84 , editor of the upcoming book " @entity175 : @entity176			1
" " that 's a signal that your data is going to be licensed many times over , and it 's going to be touched by a greater number of hands			1
" that becomes a problem , @entity84 said , because " you 're only as good as the weakest link in the chain			0
" that is , the " trusted partners " who can access the data may not have optimal security			0
storing sensitive data such as a credit card number on a business ' web site , though convenient , may also pose a risk , @entity84 said			1
" the longer they store that credit card number in their systems , the longer the period of time that someone else can gain unauthorized access to that credit card number , " she said			0
privacy at the mercy of others even if you practice a high level of caution with how much you reveal about yourself online , other people may inadvertently expose information about you			1
for instance , a friend or relative may post a photo of you on a blog or social networking web site that reveals your name , shows a street sign indicating your address and displays your car 's license plate number , @entity124 said			0
@entity124 recommends periodically looking up your name on one or two search engines to see the personal information about you on the @entity226 but adds that search probably wo n't tell you whether someone stole sensitive information , such as your credit card , address or @entity28 number			1
for that , monitor your credit report for suspicious activity , suggests the @entity236			0
the @entity237 allows you to access a free credit report each year from each of the three credit bureaus : @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243			0
" just like in health care , you should be the first one to notice when something goes wrong with you , " @entity54 said			0
" if you do n't perceive a symptom and convey it to a physician , nobody 's going to be able to help you , " he said			0
" so here , also , consumers need to be vigilant and watch over their accounts and look out to see if anything strange is happening			0

cybercriminals have data on many people but can use it only against a finite number
most businesses do n't really need your @entity28 number
privacy policies reveal whether a company will share your information with others
