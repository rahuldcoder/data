-- on @entity1 , around the globe many of us , perhaps hundreds of thousands or even millions , will be raising awareness of mental health issues to challenge outdated views , and to put an end to life - limiting , and sometimes life - threatening , stigma and discrimination that 's still attached to having a mental health problem in so many countries and communities			1
as mental health is a global issue so , sadly , is mental health stigma , shame and discrimination			1
according to the @entity19 , approximately 450 million people worldwide have a mental illness			2
in @entity22 , the figures show that one in four of us will be affected by mental health problems , yet despite touching the lives of so many , people still come up against negative reactions when they disclose their illness , which makes speaking out and seeking the support they need much harder than it needs to be			1
in reality , nine in 10 people tell us at @entity34 to change that they face stigma and discrimination because of their mental health problem			1
what 's more , over half ( 58 % ) say that stigma and discrimination is as bad as or worse than the illness itself			1
managing a mental health problem can be difficult enough , just like managing a long - term physical health problem can , but imagine not feeling able to tell anyone that you 've got diabetes or asthma			1
talking about mental health can make a big difference and social contact -- which is where people with and without mental health problems come together to have a conversation -- is an extremely powerful approach in breaking down the taboo around the issue			1
at @entity34 to change this is at the core of our ethos and we have followed the lead of other anti-stigma programs across the world , particularly the " like minds , @entity69 " program that has been running for 17 years in @entity67			0
to ensure that best practice is shared globally we are part of an @entity72 along with other anti-stigma campaigns from the @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity67 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80			0
our latest campaign coincides with @entity1 and aims to reach as many people as possible to transform their attitudes and behavior around mental health			1
it encourages people to have a conversation and promotes the little things that they can do to make a difference to someone going through a difficult time			2
as part of the campaign we are also delivering targeted work to reach people from @entity98 and @entity99 communities , and young people			0
we 're seeing a powerful social movement for change with thousands of people taking the lead within their own communities and taking action ( online and in person ) to tackle stigma			0
there are also hundreds of employers , schools , service providers and media organizations delivering stigma - busting work			0
in @entity117 , a national survey showed that public attitudes towards mental illness improved significantly last year with the biggest annual improvement in the last decade and probably since records began 20 years ago			2
there has also been a marked improvement in intended behavior with people more willing to work with , live with , and continue a relationship with someone with a mental health problem			2
@entity129 has finally arrived here in @entity117 , but we know that far more work is needed to end life - limiting stigma and discrimination ; this is the work of a generation			0
wherever you are on your journey to ending stigma , we hope @entity1 allows you to make more progress towards this vital life - changing goal			0

mental health continues to carry a stigma says @entity145
discrimination can be worse than the illness itself , she says
talking about mental health can make a big difference
