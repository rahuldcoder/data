" he was mr. integrity , " said @entity13 , a journalist at @entity14 who has been covering @entity16 since 1974			1
" governor @entity1 pushed us into the 20th century			1
" as governor from 1971 to 1979 , @entity1 secured legislative approval to levy corporate income tax , repealed consumer taxes on household utilities and apartment rentals and doubled homestead exemption amounts			1
he also pushed through a law requiring public officials to disclose their income sources			2
" everyone called him the guy with the white hat , " @entity13 said			1
@entity1 was unafraid to roll up his sleeves and pitch in			1
@entity13 recalled stopping in at the building where , in the 1970s , the " @entity35 " initiative campaign on income disclosure was being spearheaded			1
" he was sitting there counting and organizing petitions by county , so they could be turned in , " @entity13 said			1
@entity1 's terms coincided with a time of upheaval in government at a national level and in @entity47 , where three state @entity49 justices and three cabinet officers had resigned amid scandal			1
" he governed at the height of @entity54 , when there was huge mistrust , " @entity13 said			1
" he was the man who gave people confidence that @entity47 government would run honestly and fairly for everyone			0
" that passion for equality explained his fervent opposition to segregation , which he expressed through support for busing			1

though @entity1 lost on the busing issue , he proposed a second referendum on providing quality schools for all @entity47 children , which won			1
years later , @entity1 recalled his handling of busing in a conversation with @entity99			1
" i think probably the thing that he said that struck me the most was , ' i felt my job was to help people overcome their fears , ' " @entity74 recalled			0
the question of how @entity47 would balance aggressive growth and stewardship of the environment was another challenge facing the governor , who assumed office after a decade in which the state 's population grew by 2.2 million people , according to @entity74			0
so @entity1 brought together 150 state leaders and asked them to consider the direction the state should take , the historian said			2
the outcome : passage of the @entity123 , the @entity124 , the @entity125 and the establishment of the division of state planning			0
he also muscled through a $ 200 million bond to buy environmentally sensitive land for conservation and parks			0
as he sought to persuade conservative leaders to sign on to an effort that placed some restrictions on growth , @entity1 's political prowess rose to the fore			2
" he understood how the process worked , and he tried to work through the leadership , " buttonholing his adversaries and inviting them into the governor 's limo , where he would hold them hostage in the back seat and regale them " until they said they 'd listen or agree , or he 'd agree to make some changes so he could get their support			0
" " when you look at his integrity , belief and support for open government , his commitment to the opportunities for people of all ethnicities and races and backgrounds , his leadership on the environment -- it 's an incredible record			0
" @entity1 's rectitude extended to his personal life , too			2
he neither smoked nor drank and did not allow alcohol into the governor 's mansion , @entity13 said			2

though @entity1 was a @entity209 , " he was not a @entity209 , " said @entity13 , who went on to become friends with the former governor			1
" the @entity72 were really moderate @entity212 in today 's world			0
" he was a tough taskmaster , according to @entity13 , who took a master 's - level class from the retired politician			2
" he would lecture on a different federal and state case every week for an hour and a half , and then the final was just brutal -- it was a 2Â½ - hour , handwritten , pencil - and - paper , no - notes final in which he expected you to tell him everything he 'd told you			0
