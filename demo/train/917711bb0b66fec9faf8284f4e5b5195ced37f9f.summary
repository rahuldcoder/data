-- @entity1 probably wishes every tournament could be played on @entity5 's @entity4 course and after a second round 65 friday he is headed for his fourth win at the iconic venue			1
taking advantage of benign scoring conditions and just the lightest of breezes , the @entity9 carded eight birdies , including a run of six in eight holes around the turn			0
the 17 birdies he has carded over the first two rounds is also a personal best for the 14 - time major winner			0
it left him on 13 - under 131 at halfway in the @entity24 , an event he has won six times , and two shots clear of @entity30 's @entity29 , who shot a fine 67			1
woods was briefly joined at the top of the leader board by his arch @entity35 rival @entity34 , who also shot a five - under 67 for 10 - under and tied with @entity36 in third			0
woods and @entity38 fought out a classic duel at @entity5 in 2005 when @entity1 set the tournament record of 24 - under - par. with stiffer winds set for the weekend , that score is unlikely to be broken as @entity1 homes in on his second win on the @entity45 this season , the other coming at @entity48 , another of his favorite layouts			1
masters champion @entity51 and @entity52 , who shared the first round lead , were a further shot back			0
struggling @entity56 @entity55 has had to watch as his playing partner and fellow @entity59 stablemate @entity1 has made light work of the course over the first two days			1
the 23 - year - old @entity55 will at least be around for the weekend in @entity62 , unlike at last week 's @entity63 where he trudged off midway through a dismal second round -- and later apologized			2
@entity55 showed signs of improvement in a second round three - under - par 69 for two - under 142 , but finished with a dispiriting bogey five after three putting			2
it being a @entity70 event everyone in the select field gets to play all four rounds and the chance for the @entity74 to get his game into the groove as he builds up to the masters			2
defending champion @entity78 of @entity79 saw his hopes of retaining the trophy all but disappear with a triple bogey seven on the short ninth , his 18th , to finish with a level par 72 for four - under 138 .			0

@entity1 leads at halfway stage of @entity70 tournament at @entity5
woods cards a 65 for 131 on the @entity4 course
@entity29 two shots behind in second place
@entity56 @entity55 trails again in @entity62
