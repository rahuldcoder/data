@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 ' boyhood dream of a military career ended when he was hit by an improvised explosive device during a patrol two years ago in @entity8			1
" laying in that hospital bed ... sometimes i felt i 'd rather [ have ] died , " @entity4 said			2
" my life came to a complete halt			0
" reyes sustained severe blast injuries that led to his medical discharge ; he 's on 100 percent medical disability			2
like many soldiers wounded in @entity19 and @entity20 , @entity4 , now 24 , found the transition to civilian life difficult			2
but he and a handful of other injured veterans are getting help from what may seem an unlikely source : a custom home builder in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity29 recently presented @entity4 and his wife with an unexpected gift : a home built especially for them , mortgage - free			1
that 's all i can say , " @entity35 said , sobbing and clutching her stunned husband 's arm as @entity29 surprised them with the house			1
for @entity29 , giving wounded veterans a place to call home is his way of saying thanks			1
since 2005 , his organization has built four houses			1
five more are under construction , and he 's expanding his idea into a national campaign called @entity51			2
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2010 @entity55 @entity29 spent 30 years making upscale clients ' dream houses a reality			1
but he found a new mission in 2005 when he met with @entity60 about a very different type of project			0
@entity60 's 20 - year old son , a @entity64 , had been gravely injured in @entity19			1
@entity60 desperately needed to remodel his house to accommodate his son 's wheelchair			1
" i had no idea how i was going to pay for it , " @entity60 said			0
" i just knew that i had to get it done			0
" @entity29 went to advise @entity60 on remodeling his house as a favor to a friend			1
it was a meeting that changed @entity29 's life			1
he remembers @entity60 showing him photos of his son @entity76			0
" he was a big , strapping @entity64 , " @entity29 said			1
but the pictures he saw of @entity76 taken after his injury told a different story			0
" he was ... half his size			0
it was so sad , " he said			0
" it dawned on me that people are facing this all over the @entity85 " @entity29 mobilized an army of carpenters , plumbers and suppliers who took on the remodeling job for free			1
they widened doorways , built a ramp to the back door and made the bathroom handicapped - accessible			1
" anything that needed to be done , @entity29 said , ' we 'll take care of it , ' " @entity60 recalled			2
" it was just a huge , huge relief			0
" when the work on @entity60 's home was complete , @entity29 realized he was just getting started			1
" it really broke my heart to think [ about ] these young men and women , " he said			0
he decided the best way he could help wounded veterans was by doing what he knew best : building them homes			2
" it was like someone hit me upside the head with a 2x4			0
... i just felt like this is what @entity115 wants me to do			0
" he took his idea to his local trade group , the @entity119 , and convinced members to start a home - building program for wounded veterans			1
with donations from suppliers and contractors , @entity29 said , the group can build a $ 300,000 house for $ 25,000 to $ 50,000			1
each house is fully furnished and customized to meet the needs of each family and is mortgage - free			1
the group also covers the taxes and insurance for two years			0
wounded veterans or their spouses often have to find a new career or go back to school , making it hard to make ends meet , @entity29 said			1
" if you can alleviate a financial burden off these young kids where they can concentrate on rebuilding their lives , you can really make a difference , " he said			2
lt. @entity146 is one such story			0
as a @entity64 , he was injured by an ied in @entity19 in 2004 and ultimately had one of his legs amputated			2
returning to civilian life was hard , and his family rapidly burned through its savings			0
" we 'd saved money for rainy days , but ... it was raining , " @entity155 said			0
receiving a home from @entity159 in november 2008 turned their fortunes around			0
@entity155 , 34 , is now studying for his doctorate in public safety ; his wife earned her master 's degree and is now a special education teacher			2
" it saved us , " he said			0
" we 're moving on and moving forward			0
... for someone to think about me and my family ... to build a home -- wow			0
" @entity29 is determined to help as many families as he can			2
he 's trying to enlist builders ' associations across the country to join his crusade , with the goal of building 100 homes			2
his program got tremendous interest at an industry event in january , and it soon hopes to break ground on a house near @entity188 , the first outside of @entity1			1
considering the industry was hard - hit by the recession , @entity29 says he 's been heartened by the response			1
now retired , @entity29 dedicates about half of his time to this effort without pay			1
he says it 's the least he can do to repay some of the more than 30,000 troops who 've been wounded in @entity20 and @entity19			2
" these kids ... they 're doing it for me and you , " he said			0
" so we 're the ones that need to step up and do something			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity119 web site and see how to help .			0
