@entity0 has a thing for eyes			1
he is gripped by unflinching stares , by looks that belie dignity and poise			0
" even in street landscapes , i like pictures where the building is looking back at you , " admits the @entity9 photographer			1
it was this fascination that inspired him to photograph the women of @entity17 , off the coast of @entity19			1
" the powerful eyes of those girls ; they are very dark and very deep			0
that 's what attracted me to them , " he recalls			0
the women and the landscape reminded him of a powerful portraitist who defined much of his childhood : @entity9 painter @entity31			1
" @entity32 is ( @entity31 ' ) most famous painting , and one of the most famous paintings in the @entity9 tradition , " he says			1
" in the history of art , when women are portrayed , most of the time they 're being looked at			0
i like portraits of women that look back at you , and the woman in @entity32 is looking back with a lot of dignity and a lot of strength			0
" another defining feature of @entity53 's paintings , says @entity0 , is the melancholy housed in their expressions			2
he found a similar sentiment in the @entity17 's architecture			0
" you can see that same melancholy in the crumbling buildings on the island , " he says			0
the ' universal portrait ' though the influence is @entity9 , the props , the fabrics , the models and the setting are all local to @entity19			1
rather than recreate the @entity70 fashions donned by the women in @entity31 ' portraits , @entity0 picked fabrics from the @entity19 markets , and had dresses made by tailors on the island			1
" in @entity19 , they have an amazing tradition of tailors , and they work really fast			2
in one day , they can create these beautiful dresses , which you can see in the pictures , " he says			0
@entity0 's subjects also hold objects that reflect their culture			2
in de @entity31 ' painting , " the fortune - telling , " for instance , one woman uses playing cards to give a psychic reading to her friend			0
in @entity0 's version , his models use cowrie shells , a traditional @entity19 fortune - telling tool			1
" i wanted to show that some emotions are universal , and create a more universal portrait , but i also wanted to create a more @entity19 scene , " he says .			2
