@entity0 -- @entity2 chooses his words carefully when he talks about the death of his son , spc. chancellor @entity2			1
as far as he 's concerned , the soldier did n't " take his own life " or " commit suicide			0
" his son " died by suicide , " @entity2 insists -- and he has his reasons why			1
when 25 - year old chancellor @entity2 shot himself in @entity14 on june 19 , his family received much support from the military and local officials			1
@entity2 's son was given the honor afforded to a fallen service member			1
the @entity2 family went to @entity22 in @entity23 to watch as his body was flown back to @entity25 six days later			1
at his burial , seven rifles fired three times each , in true military tradition			0
later , the soldier 's aunt created a memorial wall in the family 's @entity34 living room			0
on the wall hangs spc. @entity2 's uniform , the @entity39 flag that was handed to his mother , @entity40 , after the service and the @entity34 flag that flew over the state @entity43 in his honor			1
yet there 's an empty spot on the wall for an honor that never arrived : a letter from the president			2
@entity2 wanted to know why , especially after hearing president @entity52 talk about how he struggled to write letters to the families of each and every soldier killed in the war			1
after pressing for an answer , the family found out the truth : there would be no condolence letter			1
it 's a matter of policy dating to the @entity66 era , according to the @entity67			1
the commander in chief sends such letters to the families of troops who have died in combat , but not if they committed suicide , @entity2 was told			1
the policy felt wrong to @entity2 and @entity75			1
their son was a hero , and his country should be proud of him , they said			0
so @entity2 wrote to @entity52 and @entity80 chief of staff gen. @entity79 , imploring them to rethink the policy			1
" the recognition of the president could have profound impact on the family of the suicide victim , " @entity2 wrote in august			1
read the letters to president @entity52 " the lack of acknowledgment and condolences from the president , who our family admires greatly , leaves us with an emotional vacuum and a feeling that we his family have somehow [ made ] less of a sacrifice , " he wrote in another letter to @entity79			1
a @entity67 spokesman said the administration is reviewing the " inherited " policy			1
" the president 's thoughts and prayers are with every military family who has lost a loved one in service to our country			1
as commander - in - chief , he has worked with @entity115 and @entity116 to address the mental health needs of our service members , " spokesman @entity111 wrote in an e-mail			0
spc. @entity2 completed two tours of duty in @entity14			1
when he enlisted in 2003 , the family struggled with his decision			0
but the young soldier was convinced that he made the right decision , telling his family , " we must have a military , and somebody 's got to be in it			0
" before he deployed 2005 , he was anxious but excited , his mother remembered			0
however , toward the end of his deployment , the stress of a failing marriage and the shock of war " began to wear on him terribly , " @entity2 said			1
in anger , he threw his wedding ring into the @entity141 , his parents said			0
he was put under suicide watch , and his ammunition was taken away for several days			0
at home , though , he was " back to his old self , " his father said , adding that his son found a job at @entity150 and a new girlfriend			0
he was treated at the @entity152 clinic for a shoulder injury and burn he suffered during his deployment			0
his parents assumed he was being treated for everything he needed			0
in 2009 , he received new deployment orders			0
his family suggested that he move to his mother 's native @entity156 to avoid service , but the soldier insisted that it was his obligation to see it through , his parents said			2
when @entity2 deployed again , this time as a reservist , he was n't with his original comrades			2
instead , he and 10 other @entity25 reserves shipped off with a 300 - member unit from @entity167 , with just two months of training together			0
his mental health records were not passed on either , leaving spc. @entity2 to share his past problems with his unit if he so chose			2
" i understand that , but it is a very big burden to put on a soldier to self - identify , " @entity2 said			2
in e-mails to his family , spc. @entity2 wrote about how distant he felt from his new brothers in arms			1
" i hate going to war with people i do n't know , " he said to his father			0
@entity2 said his son struggled with members of his unit who joked about troops who committed suicide , oblivious to his struggles			2
it became too much to bear			0
after a long - distance fight with his girlfriend , the soldier said in an e-mail that he wanted to shoot himself			0
after several phone calls , spc. @entity2 told his mother that he would talk to the @entity80 chaplain			2
instead , 12 hours after that e-mail , he went into a latrine and shot himself			0
the family believes that his suicide was brought on by the stress of war and the distance from loved ones			1
to them , it is death by injury like any other incident			0
" he died by suicide , " @entity2 said			2
" he just had an injury that we just did not recognize			0
" and that 's why they want a letter from the president			2
" we do n't want to force the president to write a letter of condolence			1
we hope he would want to , " @entity2 said			0
" we hope the president of the @entity39 would want to show the appreciation to a family like ours for the sacrifice we made in allowing our son to become a soldier and defend his country			2

family of spc. chancellor @entity2 , 25 , wants condolence letter from president @entity52
parents believe suicide brought on by stress of war , distance from loved ones
@entity67 : " @entity240 " policy lets president write only families of fallen soldiers
family hopes @entity52 would want to thank them for their sacrifice
