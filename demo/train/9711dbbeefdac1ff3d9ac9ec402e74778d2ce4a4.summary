-- why did women start carrying handbags ? here , the answer to this and other puzzlers			2
how did the trend for @entity7 ? long before they ever made an appearance on " @entity10 , " pointed shoes were favored by @entity12 nobles , who introduced the fashion to @entity14 on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s			2
the shoes , dubbed " crackowes " or " poulaines " -- after @entity20 , @entity12 -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging			2
in 1363 the @entity14 attempted to rein in the look by law , assigning shoe spans to social classes			2
commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches , while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length			2
@entity0 : anti-aging style secrets who invented the @entity37 ? in 1977 @entity39 student @entity38 was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra was n't holding up			1
with the help of two classmates , @entity38 sewed together two jock straps and -- presto ! -- the sports bra was born			1
the coeds founded the company @entity46 a year later , garnering eternal gratitude from exercise - loving women everywhere			2
@entity0 : restyle your style is there a @entity0 @entity52 behind @entity53 ? not quite : the most widely held theory is that the single - strapped footwear was named for a character in " @entity57 , " a children 's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s			1
@entity52 was either @entity57 's sweetheart or sister , depending on which source you consult			1
@entity63 under $ 50 what 's the connection between @entity66 and @entity67 ? @entity68 , a water - repellent fabric invented by @entity70 , got its first mention from @entity66			1
the @entity66 used the word in @entity73 to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms			1
during @entity80 , @entity78 officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original @entity70 trench			2
@entity0 : pretty smart who was the @entity85 to have @entity86 ? no one knows who originated the style , but there 's evidence that as early as 2500 b.c. @entity94 women wore pierced earrings -- gold half - moon hoops			1
men have been wearing earrings since ancient @entity97 , where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 b.c. what was the inspiration for @entity102 's @entity101 ? bored @entity103 socialite @entity102 opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time , but she found one drawback : the citrus concoctions discolored her clothes			1
she instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains , and the " @entity115 " design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born			1
the style was an instant hit with customers , who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice			1
@entity0 : dress to flatter your figure how did @entity125 , stilettos , and sneakers get their names ? the term pump first popped up in 1550 in @entity14 , where male servants sported the style			0
it is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose - fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump			0
the word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s ; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore " sneaky			0
" the modern usage of stiletto , a @entity147 - era @entity146 word for an assassin 's narrow - bladed knife , made its debut in 1953			1
the word turned out to be especially appropriate , because the shoes ' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors			0
@entity0 : avoiding @entity155 when did @entity156 around @entity157 ? for thousands of years , in such places as @entity97 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163 , umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. ( when it rained , the well - to - do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs			0
) umbrellas were n't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries			1
and another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight , portable , and available to average joes			0
have @entity178 ? hardly ! named for the nuclear - testing site @entity181 , the suits first appeared in 1946 , but @entity183 women thought them immodest			0
not until the 1960s were they accepted , possibly helped by the hit song " @entity186			1
" @entity0 : @entity187 gets a @entity188 were @entity190 cuffs really created for the @entity191 ? it is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat			1
but , in fact , @entity190 royalty invented the style in the 1500s , when flowing sleeves were the rage ; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners			0
amusingly , the competitive @entity14 tried to take credit for the fashion , which to this day they refer to as " double cuffs			0
" have women always carried purses ? once upon a time , ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing ( sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack ) and accessible through slits in their skirts			0
around 1800 , thinner , silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue , and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections			0
the solution ? they began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead			0
@entity0 : new uses for things in your closet why is underwear nicknamed " drawers " ? in the 16th century , drawers became a common term for both men 's and women 's underpants			2
made of linen , the items were no - frills and looked more or less interchangeable ( this being well before @entity245 ever had a secret ; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century )			0
most likely , underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body			0
