-- the two @entity2 journalists convicted as terrorists in @entity5 have opted to seek a pardon rather than appeal the verdict and their 11 - year sentences , a @entity2 official said tuesday			1
@entity9 and @entity10 were convicted in december by a court in @entity12 after being accused of helping the @entity13 , which @entity5 has labeled a terrorist organization , and for entering @entity5 illegally			1
the decision to try for a pardon " does not mean any change in our view that they were there working as journalists and that they should be released as soon as possible , " @entity15 , spokesman for the @entity2 @entity16 , told @entity0			2
@entity5 troops captured @entity10 and @entity9 in july during an exchange of gunfire with the rebel group in the @entity29 , a prohibited region along the nation 's border with @entity32 , according to state media in a short statement provided to @entity0 by @entity9 's mother , @entity36 , the two journalists said : " there is a tradition of mercy and forgiveness in @entity5 and we choose to rely on this tradition			1
" the @entity42 reiterated that @entity10 and @entity9 were in @entity5 working as journalists			1
" it will always be a defeat for press freedom when journalists are prosecuted , imprisoned and convicted when they are performing their job as journalists , " @entity44 , president of the @entity42 , said in a statement on the union 's website			1
@entity53 said in a phone call with @entity0 that this has been a difficult time for the family			2
" i 'm very shaken , but i 'm starting to get used to it , " she said			2
" we live day by day			2
the first big shock came when they were prosecuted			2
the next devastating moment was when the judge found them guilty of terrorism			2
" she said the two men deny that they were in @entity5 to support terrorism			1
they had no intention of disrupting anything in @entity5 , no bad intentions at all , but now it is like they are in a trap , " she said			1
" the fact that they chose not to appeal means they now have to figure out exactly how this process of seeking a pardon will work , if they have to admit to the crimes or just apologize			2
" the pair sought " the best possible advice , " she said , adding that " most experts have said that seeking a pardon is the best way forward			0
" after the trial , she said , " they felt that their defense arguments did n't have much impact " and " they felt that it was very unlikely that another judge would see it any different			1
" " this may take a long time , but they are ready for it , " she said			0
@entity53 last saw the two journalists just before @entity99 , and she said the pair feels that they have great support from home			0
" they are happy that their case has put a spotlight on press freedom and human rights in @entity5 and that their ordeal is n't in vain			1
" @entity9 and @entity10 are being held under harsh circumstances at the @entity113 prison , @entity53 told @entity0			1
" the prison is divided into zones with about 1,000 people in each zone , " she said			0
" in each zone there are small huts , with between 150 and 250 people in each , where they are locked up at night			0
in each hut there are only about 100 beds , so most people sleep on the bare floor			0
at one point @entity9 told me there were so many prisoners in the hut that they had to sleep stacked next to each other on the floor			1
" but now @entity9 and @entity10 have advanced in the prison 's " inner hierarchy , " @entity53 said , and they share a bed that is 90 centimeters wide			1
" they have also sewn , like , a tent to give them a little bit of privacy , " she said			0
" but the light is never turned off and it is never quiet at night , so i think that is the hardest thing for them			0
" the men have put themselves on a daily schedule of eating and exercising to try to stay healthy , " she said			0
" but there is no room to exercise , so they jump up and down right where they are to at least do something			0
" the family is paying a hotel across the street to bring them lunch packets each day , " and we 've given them some dry food to cook at night , " she said			0
" but they have to hang it up in the roof so that the rats do n't eat it			1
... we should have given them metal cans instead of plastic ones since the rats can eat through the plastic cans			0
" @entity9 and @entity10 have also persuaded the prison warden to allow them to start setting up a library in the prison , she said			1
" now every time we go down there from now on we will bring a suitcase full of @entity181 books			0
so if anyone wants to help out and send down @entity181 books to their new library that would be great , " @entity53 told @entity0			0
when the process of seeking a pardon can start is still unclear , the @entity2 @entity16 said .			0

@entity9 and @entity10 are serving 11 - year sentences
" there is a tradition of mercy and forgiveness in @entity5 , " @entity9 's mother says
" they felt that their defense arguments did n't have much impact " at trial , she says
they have been held in harsh conditions , she says
