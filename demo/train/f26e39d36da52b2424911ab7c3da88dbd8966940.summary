-- it 's february and @entity2 , and networks and major consumer brands are reprising their annual ad campaigns honoring the contributions of african - americans to the arts , politics , technology and commerce			1
this year , a new player is sponsoring @entity2 ads : the @entity14			1
in spots airing on black radio and television stations in select media markets , the @entity14 praises the contributions of black @entity20 such as @entity21 , a former secretary of health and human services under president @entity23			1
@entity14 makes first ad buy for @entity2 this ad campaign is part of a larger @entity14 strategy to reach out to minority voters			1
after president @entity29 won more than 70 % of the vote among blacks , latinos and @entity33 ( 93 % among blacks alone ) in 2012 , the @entity14 redoubled its efforts to court minority voters			1
this ad campaign is a part of that effort			1
a well - produced , uplifting ad campaign will not be enough to convince black @entity41 to switch their party identification , though			1
for every ad praising sen. @entity44 , the @entity20 has had to put out fires created by state and local officials who make insensitive racial comments			2
for instance , in the past two weeks , the @entity49 had to fire the mastermind behind the " is someone a @entity56 ? " flow chart on its @entity54 page			2
the flow chart flippantly charged that racists are white people you do n't like			2
@entity14 highlights strategy for building ' new generation of black @entity20 ' by this point , some @entity20 are probably wondering why blacks do n't seem to punish liberals and democrats for their racial missteps			1
@entity67 - friendly @entity66 has faced strong and valid criticism for its recent taunts of the @entity72 family 's transracial adoption and its assumptions that conservative @entity20 do n't marry interracially			0
for his part , @entity76 host @entity74 raised eyebrows when he asked @entity29 why he had not done more to lower the out - of - wedlock birth rate among blacks			0
the answer is rooted in a long , complicated history of race and partisanship and in psychological frames that the @entity20 ignores at its peril			0
@entity14 clarifies tweet that suggests racism is over some @entity20 rightfully point out that during the civil rights movement , @entity41 tried to block passage of the @entity91 and @entity92			1
they forget , however , that in the past 50 years , white @entity41 ( both racists and non-racists ) have gradually shifted their party identification to the @entity20			0
they do n't account for the fact that @entity20 has admitted to ( and apologized for ) purposely using racially coded language to win over racially resentful whites in the wake of the civil rights movement			0
and they ignore data that confirm that while black political views have moderated in the past generation , blacks still tend to prefer a stronger federal state and greater governmental intervention , in large part because they perceive the federal government to have done a better job than state and local officials at protecting civil rights			0
the ' white ' student who integrated @entity114 perhaps the biggest impediment to the @entity20 's outreach efforts among blacks , though , is its misunderstanding of the importance of group dynamics to individual political decision - making			0
@entity20 value limited government and personal liberty , traits that celebrate rugged individualism and a view of politics that assumes that self - interest informs most policy preferences			0
numerous studies have shown that many blacks and @entity132 believe that what happens to other blacks and @entity132 affects them			0
this belief that their fates are linked to the fates of their co-ethnics informs liberal policy and political preferences			0
it means that an affluent black person might be willing to pay higher taxes if it helps maintain the food stamp program , which helps poor , disproportionately minority people			0
or that a @entity149 born in the @entity150 might wince when @entity14 congressional candidates voice their opposition to immigration reform because she perceives that tone of the opposition evinces a general antipathy toward @entity132 regardless of their nativity			1
do n't get me wrong , @entity14 outreach to blacks is a good thing , and i hope to see more of it			2
@entity14 candidates who win office need to engage their black and minority constituents , and @entity41 should not assume that blacks ( or any other group ) will always vote @entity169			2
however , a polished ad campaign alone is not enough to win over black voters			1
if the @entity20 hopes to become significantly more competitive among blacks , it will have to acknowledge the importance of group identity to blacks and other minorities and learn how to frame their principles in terms of group interests			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2
