-- questions abound about how to best inoculate the world against swine flu as health officials plan for a campaign that could dwarf any previous flu vaccination effort			1
researchers in @entity8 sort through eggs for a swine flu vaccine			1
companies worldwide are working on vaccines			0
among the issues to be resolved are the amount of vaccine likely to be available , the timing of the vaccine 's availability , how it would be distributed , who would provide the shots , who would pay for them and whether it will be possible to track potential side effects			1
at a recent meeting at the @entity26 , health officials said @entity28 demand could reach 600 million doses of vaccine , enough for two doses for each of the approximate 300 million people in the @entity28			1
that 's in case two doses are required for children and adults under 50 , @entity26 representatives said			2
that would come on top of the 115 million doses of seasonal flu that are distributed annually , health officials said friday			1
although there has been no official decision to undertake a major vaccination campaign , senior officials are hinting strongly that they would recommend such an effort			0
@entity50 passed a supplemental appropriation for $ 7.5 billion , which president @entity52 recently signed , to cover the costs of preparing for the virus , which includes a vaccination campaign , @entity26 spokesman @entity49 said			2
small studies in ferrets at the @entity26 suggest that when compared with seasonal flu , the virus appears to cause more severe disease but also seems to spread less easily			1
ferrets are often used in flu research because the animal 's respiratory tract responds to flu viruses in much the same way as a human 's			2
still , it 's too soon to draw any conclusions , said @entity71 , director of the @entity26 's influenza division			0
more detailed results will be published in the journal @entity75 this week			0
the @entity76 declared the virus , also known as the novel influenza a ( @entity78 ) , a global pandemic june 11			2
more than 70 countries have reported cases of human infection with the virus , and more than 70,000 cases have been documented worldwide , according to the @entity76			0
there are 27,717 cases in the @entity28 , according to the @entity26			1
as the first pandemic strain to emerge since 1968 , the novel @entity78 virus has attracted interest from pharmaceutical companies around the world			0
samples have been sent to dozens of potential vaccine makers , said @entity94 , lab team leader for the novel @entity78 response at the @entity26			0
most vaccine production will involve the traditional route of growing a modified virus in eggs , but demand is so high that newer methods are getting a serious look			1
one comes from a small company called @entity104 , based in @entity105 , @entity106 , which recently received a $ 35 million contract from the @entity28 @entity108 to pursue a new vaccine technology			1
" the technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for @entity28 - based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu , " hhs secretary @entity110 said in a statement last week			1
the company is producing 100,000 doses of vaccine per week , said @entity121 , ceo of @entity104 the technology involves caterpillar ovary cells , which were isolated 20 years ago , and a virus called baculovirus that infects insects but does not harm humans , @entity121 said			1
scientists inject a protein of the novel @entity78 virus into the baculovirus , which can multiply quickly in insect cells			2
making large quantities of this vaccine is faster than with traditional production methods because the basic cells are able to be frozen and stored , the company said in a statement			1
@entity104 will have the vaccines ready for use in clinical trials in a month , @entity121 said			0
they will also be ready for human use if the @entity145 issues an emergency authorization to start distributing swine flu vaccines			1
" we 'll be paving the way for everybody , because the data that 's generated in those trials will allow other people to get any idea of what it 's going to take , how to make an effective vaccine , " @entity121 said			2
but the researchers do not know what is the appropriate dose size for this vaccine or whether it should be given once or twice , he said			0
these are issues that may be resolved in clinical trials			0
a more established player in the vaccine arena is @entity166 , which could have vaccines for the novel h1n1 virus available for clinical investigation in humans this summer , spokeswoman @entity163 said			2
supplies could become available to public health authorities in four to six months , and the @entity145 is reviewing the final clinical trial design , she said			0
@entity174 , another large pharmaceutical company , announced june 12 that it had produced the first batch of @entity78 vaccine weeks ahead of expectations , using cell - based manufacturing technology			0
the company plans for clinical trials to start in july and expects licensure in the fall			0
abroad , the @entity184 's department of health has signed contracts with pharmaceutical giants @entity186 and @entity187			0
the advance purchase agreement allows for up to 130 million doses , but there is flexibility in the contract , spokesman @entity188 said			1
the @entity184 health department expects that 75 million doses will be produced before the end of the year , with the first supplies arriving in august , @entity188 said			1
@entity186 spokesman @entity198 said his company 's first doses are expected to be available in four to six months			0
@entity187 has just gone into full - scale production of its novel @entity78 vaccine and is hoping to deliver it for clinical trials as early as july , said @entity205 , spokesperson for the company			2
the clinical work for this vaccine is based on the @entity210 avian flu , she said			2
" the clinical trials [ part ] is a little tricky , given that this is a brand new virus , " she said			0
" no one has done clinical trials with this particular virus			0
" in planning , @entity28 health officials are taking into account the experience of the 1976 swine flu vaccine campaign , which strove to immunize against the strain found at @entity223 , @entity224			1
more than 40 million people received the vaccine before the campaign ended because some recipients developed @entity230 syndrome , which causes temporary paralysis			1
there 's still no good working theory on what caused it , @entity71 said			0
comparisons between the two episodes are limited in value , she said , because genetic analysis shows that the current @entity78 virus is very different from the 1976 swine flu virus			1
@entity0 's @entity242 contributed to this report .			0

115 million doses of seasonal flu are distributed annually in @entity28
most vaccine production involves traditional route of growing virus in eggs
new technologies , such as using caterpillar cells , are getting attention
1976 swine flu vaccine program ended because some people became paralyzed
