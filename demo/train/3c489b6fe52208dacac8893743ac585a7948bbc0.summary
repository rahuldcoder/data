@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 thought the battle was over when her husband returned from the @entity6			0
but more than seven years after his death in 2003 , she says the @entity8 is demanding she repay more than $ 41,000 in benefits the government shelled out as part of an insurance policy he paid into			1
" they gave me 45 days to pay it back , " said @entity14 , 74 , who claims the federal government began garnishing her benefit payments when she could n't pay it all back at once			1
" they said 45 days , and two weeks later they started taking it out of my check , " she said			2
@entity14 says $ 577 is now being deducted from her military benefit check each month			1
the reason : she got remarried last year			2
it is a confusing section of a federal law that affects some 57,000 military spouses -- and their children -- who receive military benefits and are now being forced to pay @entity34 back after walking down the aisle again , according to @entity36 , a retired @entity37 vice admiral and president of the @entity39			2
" here we are taxing the groups that have done the most for this country , " said @entity36			0
" if i were in the @entity8 , i 'd be awfully embarrassed by this situation			2
" a @entity8 spokesman declined to comment on @entity14 's case			1
@entity14 's first husband , @entity46 , a 33 - year @entity47 veteran who served during @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity6 , elected to pay monthly premiums on an insurance policy for supplemental survivor benefit coverage , she said			1
the program is a @entity8 plan , similar to an annuity , that provides the benefit to the surviving spouse			1
when her husband died from heart and lung problems that the @entity47 determined were military - related , @entity14 had to choose between collecting his pension or a separate monthly benefit from the @entity64			1
in addition to the monthly benefit , the @entity8 sent her more than $ 41,000 from the government - sponsored insurance policy her husband purchased			1
@entity14 said she received the lump - sum check shortly after his death			1
it prompted her to call the @entity8 for an explanation , she said			2
" i called @entity47 finance , and they said , ' no. that 's your money			0
' i was afraid the money was n't mine and they made a mistake			0
" the letter from the @entity47 reads : " because @entity46 died from 100 percent service connected disabilities , all of the money he paid for survivor 's benefits is to be refunded			0
" " that 's what they told me , " she recalled			0
@entity14 said she then cashed the check , paying more than $ 6,000 in taxes			1
in 2009 , a federal judge ruled survivors could get both of the original benefits if they remarry after the age of 57			0
@entity14 -- who was remarried last april -- then became entitled to collect her husband 's pension in addition to the separate @entity64 benefits			1
@entity34 is now paying both , but wants the $ 41,000 back from the supplemental insurance policy , plus 6 % interest -- all because of her marriage			1
a bill that rep. @entity113 , @entity115 - @entity114 , introduced last week is meant to fix the issue			0
" a cost of war is not just guns and ammunition and tanks and airplanes , " said sen. @entity117 , @entity1			0
" a cost of war is taking care of veterans and also taking care of the deceased service members widows , widowers , and orphans			0
" the issue may be cost			0
in congressional testimony , @entity8 officials have opposed eliminating the offset because they believe it would create an inequity as some spouses would receive two benefits while others would receive only one			1
@entity36 said it will cost more than $ 600 million each year to fully cover all 57,000 remarried military spouses			2
" the military gave her the money back when he died , " said @entity143 , a spokeswoman for @entity144 , a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping military widows			0
" now they want it back			0
" @entity143 also said it is unfair that @entity14 , and others like her , have to repay the full amount , including the $ 6,000 she lost in government taxes			1
" she paid taxes ( and ) she 's going to pay taxes again , " @entity143 said			0
" this is n't right under anybody 's book			0
" @entity14 says @entity162 needs to change the law			2
" they need to fix it now , " she said , saying she feels as though @entity8 and elected officials are " waiting for the military widows to die off			2

@entity170 says the @entity8 demanded she repay $ 41,000 in benefits after she remarried
