-- @entity1 came to the @entity2 from @entity3 on a temporary @entity5 © e visa , fully expecting that she would enjoy life in a new country with the @entity2 citizen she intended to marry			1
instead , she found herself trapped as a victim of sex trafficking			0
@entity1 ( not her real name ) , like thousands of other women , was forced to engage in commercial sex acts against her will			2
we heard about her when she received support from the @entity18 in @entity19 , which serves victims who have been harmed by the sex trade			2
( @entity22 is a denominational member of the @entity24			0
) eventually , @entity1 escaped from her trafficker and assisted law enforcement in the prosecution of the crime committed against her			0
though @entity1 's @entity5 © e visa had lapsed , leaving her susceptible to deportation , our nation 's anti-trafficking law provided a legal option for her to be granted permanent legal status by helping law enforcement to prosecute her trafficker			2
with the help of a nonprofit legal service provider and the @entity22 , @entity1 was able to petition on her own for legal status -- and obtain it -- through a special " @entity43 " visa for immigrant victims of crime , allowing her to get back on her feet and begin rebuilding her life			1
this week the @entity46 is considering a proposal to reauthorize the @entity48 , first enacted in 1994 , but in a new version that would significantly undermine the same @entity43 visa program that provided @entity1 with safety and permanency in the @entity2			1
the @entity2 government estimates that as many as 17,500 foreign - born victims are illegally trafficked in from abroad each year , and academic estimates suggest that at least 100,000 victims of human trafficking live in the @entity2 today			1
by force , fraud or coercion , traffickers keep victims enslaved in prostitution or forced labor			2
if the @entity46 proposal is enacted , thousands like @entity1 could remain enslaved , too afraid to speak out because some of their most effective safeguards will have disappeared			1
the proposal. , introduced by rep. @entity70 , @entity71 , would dramatically roll back important protections for battered immigrant women and their children			1
it could face a vote wednesday afternoon			0
several provisions would leave immigrant victims of human trafficking and domestic abuse no legal way to break the cycle of violence in which they are trapped			1
specifically , this version would remove the incentive of permanent safe haven in the @entity2 for women who help bring abusers to justice			1
by changing the @entity43 visa from permanent to temporary , the bill could validate an abuser 's threat that a call to police could result in deportation			1
many women would keep quiet rather than risk immigration consequences			2
the bill would also allow abusive partners in domestic violence cases to provide input as to whether their victim should qualify for immigration relief , stripping confidentiality provisions that currently protect victims			2
abusive spouses , who are in a position to petition to adjust the status of their immigrant wives through marriage , can choose not to do so as a tool of abuse and fear			0
abusers frequently deny guilt and falsely accuse victims of fraud or abuse			1
we do n't want a bill that endangers some of the women and children it purports to help			0
overall , this bill 's proposed changes to current law would discourage immigrant victims from escaping abuse and reporting crimes , and make all of us less safe			1
women -- and , often , their children -- come to our churches for sanctuary and hope			0
we believe @entity70 ' proposal would put more lives in danger			0
it would perpetuate abusers ' use of immigration status as part of the cycle of exploitation			0
as evangelical @entity144 , we are committed to @entity146 ' great commandment to love @entity147 and to love our neighbor , with a particular concern for those who are most vulnerable			0
through local churches and ministries , we extend that love when we provide counseling and support for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence			0
in doing so , we point to the ultimate healing and restoration that we believe is found only in @entity146			0
we also love our neighbor by speaking up when laws are proposed that could cause harm , intentionally or not			0
loving our neighbor not only means reaching out to those in need , but also means addressing systemic problems that harm those in need			0
that 's why we 're asking speaker @entity172 and the @entity46 leadership to make sure that the @entity48 continues to protect vulnerable immigrant women who are victims of human trafficking or domestic violence			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 and @entity182 .			1

@entity181 , @entity184 : @entity46 *mulling* new version of @entity48
they say new version changes protections for immigrant women trafficked and abused
plan makes @entity43 visa , which protects women victims who come forward , temporary
writers : abusers are empowered in new version of act ; @entity46 should *reject* it
