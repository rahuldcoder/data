-- when @entity3 was 13 years old , a group of strangers came knocking at her family 's home in @entity6			1
her mother let them in , and feverishly they explained that earlier that day they saw @entity6 security forces surround @entity15 's father , a democracy activist , at a bus station			1
" they told us that 10 of them , the forces , had their guns out and they were all around my father			2
they kidnapped him and pushed him into a car , " she recalled			0
though they were just children , she and her siblings knew exactly what had happened			2
they knew their father risked his life as an activist who opposed the @entity6 regime			1
he was paying for that , and now too would their family			0
it 's hard for @entity15 to talk about her father			1
shortly after the regime changed hands in 2000 from father to son , he was released from prison			1
but @entity15 's father had been tortured , forever scarred and changed			1
" this is difficult to talk about , " said @entity15 who became a human rights attorney and activist , inspired by her father 's work			1
" it 's really hard to find your dad kidnapped because of his doing good			2
" until a few months ago , father and daughter were living in @entity6			1
but their activism had made them both targets , and they 're now temporarily living in the @entity62			0
they watch the horror of their country on the nightly news			0
on thursday , the @entity68 announced that the number of people killed since protests began this year against the regime of @entity73 had surpassed 4,000			1
more than 300 children have lost their lives , and the @entity68 reports that children have been specifically targeted , and some tortured to death			1
according to a september @entity68 report , the human suffering behind those numbers looks like this : security forces opening fire on a funeral procession in @entity85 , a city near the border with @entity87 ; security force snipers on rooftops picking off demonstrators in @entity91 ; the bodies of those missing , including children , being returned to their families with their bodies torn apart by torture			1
water tanks , food supplies , electricity -- everything needed to survive has been targeted by @entity6 army and security forces , according to the report			1
thousands of people have been arrested			2
more than 14,000 are reported to be in detention as a result of @entity73 's crackdown on the opposition , @entity109 said , and at least 12,400 people have fled their homes to neighboring countries			2
@entity68 @entity113 @entity109 cited a report released monday by the @entity115 which concluded that security and military forces " committed crimes against humanity " against civilians			1
@entity6 officially denied access to commission investigators but they still managed to interview 223 victims and witnesses , including military and security forces who had defected			1
foreign journalists have been blocked from entering @entity6			1
@entity129 told a @entity131 paper that @entity6 " will not bow down " and that any potential foreign military action against his country would lead to " very dire " consequences			1
but the bloodshed and the blocking of journalists and rights workers will not discourage protesters , @entity15 said			1
" the @entity6 people have known what the price of freedom would be , " she said			1
" they knew it would be very high			0
" we know that the rest of the world understands that			0
they believe that the international community will not let the @entity73 regime commit more crimes			2
" @entity154 has participated in demonstrations against @entity73 , including the march 16 rally in @entity157 in @entity91 when 150 protesters held pictures of their imprisoned relatives			1
while demonstrating in mid-may , she was detained by security forces who took her cell phone and her professional attorney identification , she told @entity0			2
" i do n't them , ' you can not arrest me without [ reason ] , i 'm a lawyer			0
' they did n't listen			0
" @entity154 said she was held in a cell in @entity91 for 48 hours in the same government building where he father had spent time behind bars			1
she believes that because she was a well - known activist and attorney , her case was pushed to a judge and she was released within a week			0
from may to september , @entity15 went into hiding , sleeping in different places constantly			0
she felt that the government was constantly watching her and monitoring her cell phone conversations , a tactic that the @entity73 regime is reportedly using to track and thwart opposition strategy			0
she chose to leave @entity6 in september and relocated in the @entity62			1
she continues to talk with her friends in @entity6 , all of varying religious and tribal backgrounds			2
she insisted that it 's a falsehood spread by @entity73 's regime that the fighting in @entity6 is between tribes and religions			1
" i have stood next to people of all religions , " she said			0
i have stood beside @entity196 , @entity195 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199			0
this is not about our differences			0
" @entity203 , an @entity62 journalist , scholar and @entity6 expert , has lived in the country and experienced firsthand the growth of discontent against @entity73 , who become president in 2000 when his father , @entity210 , died after ruling for 29 years			1
@entity203 's new book , " in the @entity217 , " is an in - depth look at the @entity213 , as well as a deep - dive analysis of @entity216 's long fraught relationship with @entity6			1
@entity73 and his @entity131 wife , @entity218 , were perceived for years as reformers , by and large			0
they touted social - service nongovernmental organizations ( @entity222 ) and spoke about reliance on civil society			0
the @entity222 were efforts to stem what the regime understood as a huge threat -- frustration and restlessness among @entity6 's young population and the lack of jobs and opportunities in the country , @entity203 said			1
" determination has been growing for some time			0
now , did we expect [ the protesting ] to go on this long ? no. i do n't think anyone did , " he said			0
@entity203 said he believes sanctions imposed recently on @entity6 will weaken the @entity73 regime			1
the @entity242 stepped up sanctions against the nation 's oil industry by blacklisting state - owned firms that oversee exploration and trade			0
the @entity249 on thursday sanctioned two government - controlled entities and two high - ranking @entity6 , including @entity252 , @entity73 's uncle and father of long - serving financial adviser @entity255			1
@entity255 is already under @entity62 sanctions			0
another was @entity258 , a @entity6 general			2
@entity259 has also imposed sanctions against regime insiders			0
" in terms of @entity6 running out of money , they 'll have an impact , " @entity203 said			2
" these are comprehensive [ sanctions ] and they will have a tremendous impact			0
will the regime be over tomorrow ? not at all			0
that 's going to take some work and time			0
but the death toll for november is the highest it has been so far so that means it 's getting worse , not better			1
" during her exile , @entity15 has met with @entity131 foreign secretary @entity277 and foreign office minister @entity278 to stress that the protests will continue until @entity73 's regime ends			2
in october she joined the @entity282 , an opposition coalition created during the 2011 uprising			0
@entity284 was formed in @entity285 last month and encompasses representatives of local committees inside @entity6 and exiled personalities , as well as @entity290 and secular representatives			2
@entity154 wants to continue speaking out			0
one day she 'll return to @entity6			2
" we called our revolution the @entity294 , " she said			0
" we decided as @entity6 people to go into the street and get our human dignity back			2
we will not go back to our homes without it			0
