@entity1 , @entity0 -- a number of filmmakers have looked to golf for inspiration for their movies -- but it is not often a professional golfer does the reverse			0
@entity12 defends his @entity13 at @entity14 , @entity15 in july three - time major winner @entity12 has broken the mould after experimenting with a devastating ice - hockey swing as used in the cult @entity20 comedy sports film @entity18			1
the film 's plot centers of the fortunes of failed ice - hockey player @entity18 , played by @entity26 , who masters a powerful and dangerous slap shot which he converts to golf with devastating effect			2
the result is that @entity32 is able to whack a golf ball over 400 yards , and now @entity34 has copied @entity32 's breathtaking run - and - smash technique - and amazingly has added an extra 30 yards to his drive ! but is the spectacular swing legal ? the @entity38 ( @entity39 ) , who along with the @entity40 ( @entity40 ) , produce and revise the rules of golf , can see no problems with the method			1
a spokesperson at the rules department of the @entity39 told @entity2 : " there is nothing in the rules as such to prevent the swing as performed in the film @entity18 from being used by golfers			1
you do not have to be standing still over the ball when playing a shot , so striking the ball with a run - up is okay			0
" the major concern we do have is regarding the whether it fits in with the etiquette of the game as defined in the rules			0
players must have respect for the course itself and perhaps this shot lends itself to increased likelihood of damage to the course			0
" while @entity12 may not necessarily be ready to unleash the eye - catching swing when he goes in search of his third consecutive @entity75 at @entity14 , @entity15 next month , the technique may still have a place in the game			2
dr @entity77 , who is part of the @entity79 and @entity80 at the @entity81 , @entity0 , believes that , with development , the swing could become part of the range of shots used by the modern golfer			1
" golfers are always looking for ways to improve their game which might give them an edge on their rivals so it would n't surprise me if some professionals start to experiment with the swing used by @entity18 , " @entity77 told @entity2			1
" one of the obvious benefits of the swing is that it allows you to generate more power and subsequently more distance on the shot as @entity12 has shown			2
" certainly the scientific principles behind the swing and the technology used are credible as well , although golf is just as much about accuracy as power			0
" dr @entity77 does have some reservations about the possible risk of injury with the swing -- particularly if it is not executed properly			1
" the main drawback of the ' @entity18 technique ' from a physiological point of view is that it does place much more stress on the spine , lower back and the shoulders , " he added			0
" therefore the likelihood of injury is increased so certainly i would be cautious of amateur players rushing down to their local club and trying to copy him thinking it might drastically improve their game			0
" perhaps a player might use when he feels has nothing to lose in a match , but when it comes to pressure situations players tend to fall back on tried and trusted methods			0
" certainly @entity12 's use of the ' @entity18 technique ' has got golf talking , but perhaps a copy of the film will not be found on the shelves next to coaching manuals just yet .			1

@entity12 experiments with swing used in movie @entity18
@entity39 *confirms* devastating technique is legal under the rules of golf
golf science expert dr @entity77 believes method could catch on
