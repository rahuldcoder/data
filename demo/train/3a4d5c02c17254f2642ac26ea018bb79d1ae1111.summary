@entity0 , @entity1 -- calling it a significant step forward for the alliance and @entity8 security , president @entity3 announced friday that @entity9 will develop a missile defense system to safeguard most of @entity8 and the @entity11			1
the agreement , according to the president , followed a year of talks to determine the best ways to coordinate efforts to protect members of the 61 - year - old alliance			1
the system would be " strong enough to cover all @entity9 @entity8 territory and populations , as well as the @entity11 , " @entity3 told reporters in @entity0 , @entity1			1
the missile defense plan " offers a role for all of our allies in response to the threats of our times , " the president said			0
" it shows our determination to protect our citizens from the threat of ballistic missiles			0
" @entity3 addressed reporters during the first day of what he promised would be a " landmark summit " featuring leaders of @entity9 's 28 member countries , as well as @entity41			1
by the time it wraps saturday , the alliance aimed to produce a set of new initiatives intending to reinvigorate and redirect @entity9 20 years after the end of the @entity48			1
@entity9 secretary - general @entity49 announced friday that heads of state had agreed to a new mission statement , calling it the alliance 's " road map for the next 10 years			1
" crafting this so - called strategic concept had been a top priority of the meeting , which @entity49 last month deemed " one of the most important summits in the history of our alliance			2
" " this strategic concept reconfirms the commitment by @entity9 members to defend one another against attack , and that will never change , " @entity49 said in @entity0			1
" but it also modernizes the way @entity9 does defense in the 21st century			2
" the document , prepared from recommendations made by a panel led by former @entity11 secretary of state @entity75 , sought to build upon @entity9 's work in @entity77 to redefine the alliance as a " global " actor that would work with regional partners to combat threats outside @entity8			2
under the new plan , @entity9 will bolster its role in counterinsurgency efforts , as well as the stabilization and reconstruction of key countries , according to @entity49			2
the defense alliance will also develop " a standing capability to train local security forces " and create a civilian arm to deal with other nations and groups			0
@entity3 added friday that @entity9 , under @entity49 , was also looking at how to deal with threats like improvised explosives and cyber defenses , all serving a commitment that " an attack on one @entity9 member is an attack on all			2
" @entity77 will be front and center on saturday 's agenda , with @entity9 members working with others who have committed resources to the nation and its government to " align our approach , " according to @entity3			1
he said that includes having @entity77 forces transition , between 2011 and 2014 , taking over the security and governance mission in the country and forging a " long - term partnership " beyond that			2
@entity41 's relationship with @entity9 and the @entity11 is also a chief focus saturday			1
@entity3 said that starting then , @entity9 will work with @entity41 " to build our cooperation with them in this area ... recognizing that we share many of the same threats			1
" in an exclusive interview with @entity2 's @entity130 , @entity128 president @entity127 said he hoped that @entity41 's deepening partnership with @entity9 would cause @entity132 to take a " more civilized approach " in dealing with its neighbors			1
@entity41 troops have occupied @entity128 territory since its invasion in 2008			2
@entity127 , whose country 's bid to join @entity9 has been stalled for several years , said that he hoped the alliance 's involvement would prompt @entity41 to withdraw its troops from @entity128			1
" once @entity41 becomes less paranoid , more cooperative , more self - confident in a nicer way -- because i think lots of things have emerged from their almost paranoid sense of insecurity -- hopefully , the small neighbors of @entity41 hopefully will feel themselves more safe , " said @entity127 , who met with @entity3 on friday			2
@entity3 reiterated his belief that the @entity150 should pass the new start nuclear control treaty , which the @entity11 and @entity41 agreed on last spring but has not been ratified by either nation 's legislatures			2
@entity155 @entity154 have held up a vote on @entity157 , citing a heavy workload , in the lame duck session before a new @entity150 comes in next year , and concerns about the strength of the @entity11 nuclear arsenal			0
@entity3 said friday that @entity9 leaders had called passage of the treaty -- which , among other things , would restart mutual nuclear inspections and limit the arsenal in the two countries -- critical to @entity8 and global security			1
" a failure to ratify [ this treaty ] ... will put at risk the substantial progress that has been made in advancing our nuclear security and our partnership with @entity41 , " @entity3 said			0
the search for a new mandate for the entire alliance comes at a time that 16 of the 28 @entity9 members have announced cuts in defense spending			1
@entity9 officials said leaders are expected to agree at the summit on a list of the top 10 spending priorities , including helicopters , transfer aircraft , technology to combat improvised explosive devices and increased medical capabilities			1
the outcome of the war in @entity77 is intrinsically tied to the future of the @entity9 alliance , a new analysis from the @entity196 suggested			1
the report , published friday , warns that the @entity11 lead in the war could undermine any future willingness to fight together if needed			0
" in an alliance that finds achieving consensus is central , having one partner clearly overshadow all others highlights the real limits of the transatlantic alliance , " the report said			0
the difficulty and length of engagement will weigh on decisions by alliance members to intervene or aid in the future			0
" the scope of @entity9 's future roles abroad may be more limited , such as focusing on humanitarian assistance or training , advising , and assisting nations that seek support			0
while these efforts may entail long - term commitments , they would fall well short of committing combat forces , " wrote the @entity196 authors , @entity224 and @entity225			0
the new strategic concept will cite current security challenges facing @entity9 members in the 21st century , such as terrorism , cyber warfare and piracy			1
@entity49 has encouraged @entity9 members to be more agile in order to respond to 21st century threats and to continue to invest in military technology despite the global economic downturn			1
he urged allies to " cut fat , not muscle " and pool military spending			0
the @entity11 is pushing for a realignment of military spending priorities			0
" we have proposed and hope to have accepted a set of capabilities that the alliance , in a time of dwindling resources , will decide it must fund , " @entity11 ambassador to @entity9 @entity247 told reporters earlier this week			2
" those are capabilities that deal with ongoing operations in @entity77 , but also capabilities to deal with 21st century threats , including beefing up our cyberdefenses and embracing the deployment of missile defenses to protect @entity8 territory and populations against the growing threat of ballistic missiles			0
" @entity3 also will hold a summit with @entity267 leaders , seeking to reaffirm a partnership with @entity8 that many feel has gone adrift as the @entity11 expands its partnerships in @entity271			0
@entity272 and economic growth are expected to top the agenda at a time of growing tension between @entity11 and @entity8 countries over the way to fix the global economy			0
while the @entity11 has pushed for stimulating economic expansion with more government spending , many @entity8 allies are tightening their belts			0
the future of some 80,000 @entity11 military forces in @entity8 will also be discussed			0
@entity8 leaders are looking for @entity3 to keep @entity11 troops at their current levels , although the @entity3 administration has urged @entity8 to share more of the burden of its own defense			0
@entity2 's @entity293 contributed to this report .			0
