since june 2001 , more than 150 people have died in the @entity66 after being subdued with stun guns , according to @entity68 , which has called for police departments to suspend use of the devices pending study of their possible risks			1
more than 7,000 of the nation 's 18,000 law enforcement agencies use the devices , @entity68 says			2
recent deaths involving taser devices have received much publicity			0
last month , a police officer at @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82 , used a taser gun on a 40 - year - old man making his first airplane trip outside @entity86			0
in a statement released friday , @entity87 cited the @entity80 case and said it " appears to follow the pattern of many in - custody deaths or deaths following a confrontation with police			2
@entity95 , medical science and forensic analysis has shown that these deaths are attributable to other factors and not the low - energy electrical discharge of the @entity47			2
" a bystander 's video of the october 14 incident in @entity80 shows the victim continuing to struggle after being shot with the device			0
@entity87 said on its web site that the struggle " is proof that the @entity47 device was not the cause of his death			0
" cardiac arrest caused by electrical current would have caused immediate death , the company said			0

but @entity68 , noting that coroners have determined tasers were a contributing factor in more than 30 deaths , said such a link can not be ruled out			2
the devices use compressed nitrogen to shoot two probes -- connected to the device by wire -- up to 35 feet at speeds exceeding 100 mph			0
an electrical signal transmitted through the wires contacts the body or clothing , " resulting in an immediate loss of the person 's neuromuscular control and the ability to perform coordinated action for the duration of the impulse , " according to the company			0
