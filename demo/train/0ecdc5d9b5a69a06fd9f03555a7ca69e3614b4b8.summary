@entity0 -- 't is the season to publish those year - end predictions			0
forecasting in any form -- from a sideshow psychic to the @entity6 -- is usually a foolish enterprise			0
so this is not a crystal ball gaze at the newsmakers that will make the headlines next year			0
these are the individuals i will be watching from @entity1 's @entity0 newsroom and in the field in 2014			1
the june 4 protester june 4 , 2014 will be the 25th anniversary of the @entity18 crackdown			2
in 2013 , tens of thousands of @entity0 residents braved a rainstorm to hold a vigil in the city 's @entity22 to honor the victims and express anger at @entity26			2
though such protests are banned in mainland @entity29 , the vigil is an annual event in @entity0 , a self - administered region under @entity29 sovereignty			1
twenty - five years after the crackdown , how many more in @entity0 will observe this major anniversary ? and how will @entity26 respond ? 2			0

since then , @entity57 has announced plans to launch next year in @entity69			0
with @entity58 on board , can @entity57 's inexpensive and highly customized @entity71 smartphones find as much favor abroad as at home ? 4			0
the marshal @entity77 's young leader , @entity76 , remains as perplexing as ever			1
why did he execute his former trusted mentor and uncle @entity78 ? why did he release @entity81 veteran @entity80 ? and why the soft spot for former @entity84 star @entity83 ? after a year of puzzling and provocative moves -- including missile and nuclear tests -- the marshal has forced the world 's attention on him , raising concerns of more brinksmanship to come			0
