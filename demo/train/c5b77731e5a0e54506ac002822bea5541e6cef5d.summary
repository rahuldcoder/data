and not just a little bit			0
" @entity1 is a spaghetti - ball piece of technology that has lousy performance and really bad security problems , " he said , according to biographer @entity5 in his book published earlier this month			0
on wednesday , @entity10 announced it will no longer be developing @entity1 , its media - player tool , for mobile devices			1
more than a few bloggers have noted the news would have been vindication for the late @entity16 co-founder , who felt betrayed by @entity10 more than a decade ago			1
in a post on the @entity10 blog , company vice-president @entity17 said @entity1 has enabled the @entity21 's richest content for a decade			1
" however , @entity26 is now universally supported on major mobile devices , in some cases exclusively , " he said , apparently a nod to @entity16 's @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25			1
" this makes @entity26 the best solution for creating and deploying content in the browser across mobile platforms			2
" @entity26 is the emerging web language that many developers are using			2
the @entity16 vs. @entity10 standoff over @entity1 has been one of the tech world 's most visible , and at times nasty , disputes			1
as the company shifts away from developing software for smartphones and tablets , it is impossible to ignore the part that @entity16 's steadfast refusal to use @entity1 on its popular mobile products may have played in the decision			1
under @entity0 , who died october 5 after a long battle with cancer , the @entity23 became the industry 's leading smartphone and the @entity24 emerged to virtually dominate the tablet space			2
while there are more phones running @entity58 's @entity57 software ( many of them pointedly advertising their flash compatibility ) , no products captured the public 's imagination , and attention , quite like @entity16 's			1
as such , when @entity0 blasted @entity1 , people listened			2
and blast it he did			0
he called it " buggy , " a battery hog and a product created by lazy developers			0
" allowing flash to be ported across platforms means things get dumbed down to the lowest common denominator , " @entity0 said , according to @entity5			0
" we spend lots of effort to make our platform better and the developer does n't get any benefit if @entity10 only works with functions that every platform has			0
last year , the company bought multiplatform ads which , perhaps appropriately , flashed this message : " we love @entity16 ...			0
what we do n't love is anybody taking away your freedom to choose what you create , how you create it , and what you experience on the @entity21			0
" according to the biography , @entity0 ' longstanding animus toward @entity10 helped form his vision for @entity16 's tightly controlled mobile environment			1
in 1999 , he was flatly denied when he asked @entity10 to create a version of its popular @entity97 digital - graphics software for the @entity10 also would n't rewrite @entity98 for the @entity100 's operating system , even though @entity100 were popular with designers			1
" my primary insight when we were screwed by @entity10 in 1999 was that we should n't get into any business where we did n't control both the hardware and the software , otherwise we 'd get our head handed to us , " @entity0 said , according to @entity5			1
the two companies go back together even further			0
@entity16 invested in @entity10 in 1985 and they worked together early on			2
but @entity0 , who in @entity5 's book comes off sometimes as vindictive and brusque as he was innovative and inspirational , told @entity5 that @entity10 went downhill after founder @entity111 retired			1
" the soul of @entity10 disappeared when @entity111 left , " he said			0
" he was the inventor , the person i related to			0
it 's been a bunch of suits since then , and the company has turned to crap			0
" on wednesday , @entity10 said its upcoming release of @entity120 for @entity57 and the @entity121 will be the platform 's final mobile update			2
moving forward , @entity17 said , @entity10 plans to work with " key players in the @entity26 community , including @entity58 , @entity16 , @entity126 and @entity127			1

@entity0 hated @entity10 's flash , which will quit developing for mobile devices
the @entity16 *ceo* 's feud dated to 1999 , when @entity10 would n't develop for the @entity100
he called @entity1 " buggy ; " while @entity10 *criticized* @entity16 for *depriving* developers of freedom
@entity10 will now support @entity26 , which @entity16 's mobile devices use
