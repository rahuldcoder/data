@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 authorities are having an @entity6 moment			1
imagine what it felt like for the famed @entity10 federal agent to arrest legendary gangster @entity11 in 1929			0
it 's probably close to how our southern neighbors feel now that they have in custody @entity15 , leader of the brutal paramilitary drug cartel known as @entity18			1
the takedown is a major coup for @entity4 president @entity21 , who came to office just seven months ago and returned the @entity23 to power			1
i had the chance to meet with @entity21 in @entity27 in november a few weeks before he was sworn in , as part of a group of other @entity10			1
it was clear from what we heard that he intended to implement a different strategy against the cartels than the one deployed by former president @entity36 , who hailed from the rival @entity37			1
his predecessor took the fight to the cartels , and the result was more than 70,000 deaths with some estimates reaching as high as 120,000			1
even before he was elected , @entity21 had signaled to @entity27 's voters that surrender was n't an option , that legalizing drugs was n't on the table , and that the fight against the cartels would continue -- with different methods and objectives			1
the new plan was to continue to confiscate the traffickers ' money and drugs while not driving up the body count			0
@entity21 was supposed to focus less on capturing drug lords and more on curtailing violence and protecting the @entity4 people			1
i wanted to understand this terrain better			0
and so , before i left @entity27 , i met up with an old friend who also happens to be one of the best reporters in the business and certainly one of the most knowledgable about @entity27			2
@entity68 is the @entity27 bureau chief for the @entity69 and author of the acclaimed new book , " midnight in @entity27 : a reporter 's journey through a @entity75 's @entity74			2
" i asked him if @entity10 should be concerned now that there is a new sheriff in town			0
what is to stop @entity21 from giving up on this war ? " i do n't think they can afford to give up on it , " @entity68 said			2
" that would be like conceding the country			0
and yet , i also think the strategy of going after the cartels , confronting them head - on , is only going to generate more and more violence			2
" this is supposed to be a new kind of drug war , although it bears a striking resemblance to the old war			0
as critics have pointed out , the number of casualties in first six months of @entity21 's administration are almost identical to the number in the last six months of @entity36 's tenure in office			2
some @entity4 are wondering if , politics aside , the two major political parties in @entity27 will turn out to be more or less the same in the war on drug trafficking			1
for a frame of reference from this side of the border , think about how -- in fighting the war on terror -- president @entity112 has borrowed liberally from president @entity114 's strategies for securing the @entity10 homeland			0
and from the looks of it , @entity27 's enemy is just as determined as ours to wreak havoc and create nightmares			2
in the last 10 years , the drug trade in @entity27 has become much more brutal			1
a big reason for that is the arrival on the scene of @entity18 , and dangerous individuals like @entity15 who had a $ 5 million bounty on his head courtesy of the @entity10 government			1
the cartel is a relative newcomer in @entity27 's bloody drug trade			1
its origins date back to 1999 , when elite commandos of the @entity4 army decided that they would rather work for the drug traffickers than shoot it out with them			1
so they deserted and became the muscle of the powerful and well - established @entity140			0
in 2010 , @entity18 went into business for themselves			2
three things set them apart : they have diversified their illicit activities beyond drug trafficking to include extortion , kidnapping , prostitution and other crimes ; they 're more sophisticated and tech savvy than their rivals , according to @entity10 authorities ; and they are much more violent and apt to brutally terrorize the population -- with beheadings , torture , mass killings , grenades tossed into crowds , bodies hanging in the town square like pinatas at the mercado , and more			2
even with @entity167 behind bars , the horror is likely to continue			0
his brother is in line to succeed him			0
the metaphor you hear from the cynics in @entity27 is that when authorities cut off the head of the serpent , another head grows in its place			0
but high - profile arrests like these do serve a purpose			1
they put the cartels on notice that they 're in the cross hairs , and make it clear that the @entity4 government wo n't negotiate with narco - terrorists			1
that chapter of the story is new , at least when you think about how cozy these parties were a few decades ago			0
" for 50 or 60 years , we looked the other way , " said @entity68			0
" it 's like you do n't want to let the evil spirit out of the bottle			0
that 's what we did in @entity27 for too long , and now that it 's out , you 're going to have to face a monster			1
" now that our neighbors are no longer looking the other way and they 're confronting their monster , @entity10 must continue to back them up so they do n't have to do it alone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those @entity209 .			0
