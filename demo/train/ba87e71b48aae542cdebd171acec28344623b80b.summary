-- by now , people in the @entity2 and elsewhere in the world are familiar with the @entity4 , but there 's a new social movement on the political block -- it 's called the " @entity8 , " and its leaders say the group is serving as a wake - up call to the @entity13 voting bloc			1
@entity8 organizers describe their movement as a nonpartisan group that launched this year on may 5 -- @entity17 , to mark the @entity19 holiday			1
it has enlisted both @entity22 and @entity23 to get the more than 20 million eligible @entity13 voters to become " consistent primary and general election voters , " the movement 's website says			1
in other words , its organizers say , it is not a political party in the traditional sense			1
it 's more about registering to vote and then voting than supporting particular candidates			1
" i think first you have to understand the humor of calling it the @entity8			1
we are a culture that likes humor , " the movement 's main political consultant , @entity39 , told @entity0			1
" we 're not @entity43			1
humor is part of our politics as well			1
we could have called it the ' @entity47			2
' you have to laugh because there is no logic in racism			2
" in 2008 , during now - secretary of state @entity53 's run to become president , @entity39 was her national @entity55 co-chair			2
a @entity56 , @entity39 said he believes there is no better time for the @entity8 movement			1
" there is fertile ground right now for a message like this , " he added			2
" we 're appealing to a large group in this nation			1
we 're not appealing to a minority , but to a mass of people			2
we 're united by culture and language			2
" @entity8 leader @entity71 told @entity0 that the movement " is a platform for us to position ourselves as consistent voters			1
" " this is not a movement in place to endorse any politician whatsoever , " she said in a phone interview from @entity76 , @entity77 , where the movement is based			2
" we 're not going to bash politicians like the @entity4 does			2
this is about voting and why we 're in the situation we 're in			1
" the goal is to influence the 2012 elections , @entity19 said			2
the group is now in the final stages of organizing a national tour of concerts , events , dinners and rallies in 20 states that will " encourage a massive @entity13 ' get out the vote , ' " she said			1
the kickoff event is june 4 in @entity76 , @entity77			2
the @entity2 @entity13 population grew 43 percent in 10 years between 2000 and 2010 -- four times faster than the total @entity2 population -- according to figures from the 2010 census			1
currently , people of @entity13 origin make up only about 9 % of the eligible electorate , according the @entity107			1
still , @entity13 were one of the most sought - after voting groups in the 2008 presidential election and were heavily concentrated in at least four battleground states in the presidential campaign -- @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
" we 're one - out - of - four people entering college			2
we 're now becoming more obvious			2
we 're national now , " said @entity39 , who is a @entity119 who immigrated as a child to the @entity2 in 1961 and now lives in @entity122			2
" we 're no longer regional			2
we are reflective of a world that is changing			2
latins are the neighbor next door that brings global society			0
" @entity19 is also head of @entity129 ( we are @entity129 ) , the largest @entity13 @entity23 group in the nation			1
she says the genesis of the @entity8 grew out of frustration with the @entity136 administration 's failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform and legislation including the @entity139 , @entity19 says			1
but she is quick to clarify the movement is not " anti-obama , but pro-social justice			0
" the dream -- development , relief and @entity146 -- @entity139 would offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the @entity2 as children			0
in december , it failed to pass the @entity151 during a lame - duck session of @entity153			0
" the immigration issue is the number - one concern to @entity156 right now , " @entity19 says			1
" we 've witnessed over 800,000 @entity156 get deported			0
we 've heard the cries and the pain and the suffering from families who are being forced apart			0
now is a time for us to become better voters			0
" @entity19 concedes the idea for the @entity8 was not originally hers			1
she credits @entity164 as being the inspiration behind the movement			0
@entity164 is president of the nonpartisan @entity115 group @entity13 in @entity168			1
" the movement is important because it unites efforts from the two major parties and others who want to get involved on issues that their party is not dealing with or their party may be in disapproval of , " @entity164 told @entity0 from his office in @entity170			0
" this is a collective resolution for the @entity13 community			1
to this moment i have not received any negative feedback			0
" @entity164 first got involved in politics more than 30 years ago as a volunteer for now - sen. @entity188 's campaign for lieutenant governor of @entity115			0
" the principle thing for the @entity8 movement is border education , " @entity164 said			1
" everything else will come through once we accomplish a good community empowerment movement that will allow us to be as effective as we can			0
the challenges may be that non-hispanics may try to make an issue of this as a third - party movement			0
that 's a misinterpretation of what we 're trying to accomplish			0
" for first - generation @entity119 @entity205 , 19 , a rising @entity207 sophomore in @entity208 , @entity209 , and an unregistered voter , the @entity8 movement is a good idea in principle , but he 's skeptical about its ability to succeed in accomplishing its goals			1
" i do n't think it 's necessary , " @entity205 told @entity0			0
" i think people my age are really hard - headed			0
... i really do n't think people my age are going to listen to them			0
" " they 're going to have to do more than just concerts ( to succeed ) , " he added			0
@entity221 political science associate professor @entity220 is also skeptical			0
he has conducted political research on @entity156 for more than 15 years and is currently a pollster for @entity224 , an independent polling firm that began in 2007			0
" my impression is that it 's 99.9 % driven by @entity129 latinos			0
everyone that i 've talked to about it believes that to be the case			0
it 's more of an effort to try and get the @entity23 to take the immigration issue more seriously and to not ignore the @entity13 vote , " @entity220 told @entity0 in a phone interview			1
" based on history , i think they 're going to continue issuing press releases and they may hold some events surrounding immigration issues , but i 'm not sure they 're currently set up with the organizational capacity to conduct massive voter registration drives , " he added			1
@entity19 says organizers have not received any funding from @entity23 for the @entity8 and reiterated to @entity0 that the movement is not at all affiliated with the @entity23			1
" a lot of our leaders are @entity56 , " she said			0
right now , @entity19 says , the group has more than 55 grass - roots leaders throughout the nation working to get sponsors for the rallies , which are planned in places with a conventional @entity13 presence including @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity122 , but also in non-traditional @entity13 cities like @entity261 , @entity262 ; @entity263 , @entity264 ; and @entity265 , @entity266			1
" we 're working with a group of pro-immigrant - minded business leaders in @entity112 for financing			1
it would cost between $ 5,000 and $ 6,000 per metropolitan city			0
we want to bring in a good entertainment like @entity274 and @entity275			0
if we do n't get the national acts , we 'll go local , " she said			0
@entity19 , a sixth generation @entity19 whose parents worked in the potato fields of @entity281 when she was a child , says that for now , 100 % of her focus is on the @entity285 movement			0
the pro-immigration reform advocate says she plans on changing her political affiliation to independent so that she can be taken seriously by critics as a legitimate social leader			1
" i used to be a rah - rah @entity23			0
to heck with that , " @entity291 said			0
" this is n't about politics			0
i 've always maintained i 'm a real @entity129 , but i 've been called names because i defend my community and put people before party			0
i still get attacked for that			0

organizers are calling an effort to *increase* the @entity13 voting bloc the " @entity8 "
they say it is nonpartisan and not endorsing candidates
voter registration and immigration reform are focal points for the group
