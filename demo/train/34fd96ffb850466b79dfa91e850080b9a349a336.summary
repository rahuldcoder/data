-- everyone from " @entity2 " to " @entity4 " fans is waiting in line at @entity6			0
this nearly 40 - year - old convention is mainly devoted to comic books , and it was sold out before the exhibitors and speakers were even announced this year			1
why are so many people there ? in 2009 , @entity13 , one of the world 's largest comic book , graphic novel and merchandise distributors , sent out 79 million comic books and 15 million graphic novels to stores			1
it 's not only geeky , teenage boys reading the comics			2
buyers include include teenage girls , college students and professionals in their 40s , comic book store owners and industry experts say			1
many people , including @entity33 , started reading comic books as children			1
@entity33 , who has owned @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , for 30 years , still remembers the first comics he bought			0
" i started collecting comic books when i was a little kid , maybe 12 years old			1
i went into an old - timey drug store -- it still had a counter that had a malt shop -- and back in the back it had a rack of comics , " he said			0
" i remember buying three comics , all @entity49			0
" @entity53 , " " @entity54 , " and " @entity52 , " and i fell in love with them			0
" but comic books were n't always designed to attract children 's allowance dollars			1
@entity59 comics started out in the 1930s as a successful way to sell newspapers , said @entity63 , ceo of @entity64			0
" the sunday paper was literally wrapped in funnies to get people to buy that newspaper as opposed to the competition , " he said			0
" the comic strips were so popular that two salesmen had the idea to repackage them			1
" after the success of @entity74 , which was the first appearance of @entity76 -- and a failed comic strip , @entity63 pointed out -- a flood of copycat superhero comic books appeared			1
" for many years comics were taken as children 's entertainment , " @entity63 said			0
" but we 've seen the graying of the comic book audience			1
because we have an older clientele , the subject matter has matured			0
there was a poll done recently that said comic readers are more likely to be in their mid 20s than 12 or younger			2
" even the art in comic books -- a major appeal of the medium -- is more mature , he said			1
comic books also have seen a shift in storylines and characters			1
@entity103 , owner of @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity38 , said that more of today 's comic books appeal to women			1
" [ women comic book characters are ] positive role models -- strong women , confident women , women with great careers , " @entity103 said			1
" @entity114 from ' @entity115 ' is a great example of that			2

it 's not just the woman in the bathing suit anymore			0
" " [ artists ] are crossing over , " said @entity125 , owner of @entity126 in @entity127 , @entity128			0
" like @entity130 , who wrote mystery novels and crime novels			2

" when a mainstream writer writes a comic book , people want to check it out , he said			1
in @entity146 , people have enjoyed comics since the time of @entity149			2
these days , it is not uncommon to see businessmen , grandmothers and school children all reading comic books on subways and trains			1
@entity157 , the chief researcher of the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity146 , said the cartoon form is appealing because it offers a " more unique expression than a movie or a novel			2
" the " transformation , exaggeration and omissions " that the images in comics make convey information on multiple levels , and is similar to the way @entity173 writing is ideographic script , he said			0
( in @entity146 kanji , for example , the idea or image of the word is often included in the shape of the word 's symbol			2
) the equivalent of a comic book in @entity146 is called " manga			1
" @entity186 is a mainstay of @entity146 publishing , taking the form of magazines or even small paperback books			1
these printed cartoons follow a similar structure to @entity59 comic books , but have evolved to appeal to @entity146 sensibilities and include a wide variety of topics			1
@entity186 can encompass just about any genre : science fiction , horror , fantasy , comedy , action , sports , fashion , geared toward young women or men , and even graphic and adult content in some cases			1
@entity209 likes comic books , too			1
in the past 10 years , the box office has been beholden to anything superhero			0
we 've seen wildly successful franchises of @entity49 's " @entity115 , " " @entity52 , " " @entity215 , " and @entity216 's " @entity133 , " and " @entity217			0
" @entity64 has had success with the " @entity220 " franchise , " 300 " and " @entity221 "			2
@entity222 points out that there are plenty of other movies based on comic books that are n't so overtly full of superheroes			1
" it 's astounding , even a movie like @entity232 ' " road to perdition " was a comic graphic novel			2
another one is " @entity234 , " @entity236 's graphic novel			0
they 're all over the map			0
" so how does a fan of these movies take the next step and follow their favorite characters on other adventures ? comic books are a great option , said @entity125			1
there 's even a phone number to call -- 888 - comic - book -- to find out the comic shop closest to you			2
not to worry , said @entity125 , it probably wo n't be like the comic book guy 's store from " @entity254			1
" " it 's like @entity258 in here , " said @entity125 of his store			0
" it 's some place people can come to and hang out and talk about [ their favorite comics ]			0
things they ca n't get to at home or at work , " he said			0
