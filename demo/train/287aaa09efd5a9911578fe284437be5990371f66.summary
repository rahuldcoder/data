@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 : back to love @entity3 is one prime example of how @entity7 talent is taking the world by storm			1
when i met her at the 2004 @entity11 , where she won the @entity12 , i felt she was going to become an international sensation			2
now a three - time mobo award winner , she seems to get better and better each time she releases new material			2
she recently created a free mixtape called " aom : @entity18 , " which could have easily been another record , but the song that i just love is " back to @entity21			2
" the track 's message can come across a bit upsetting since it 's about her ex-boyfriend moving on			2
but @entity3 makes you think of the bigger picture and does n't dwell on the past but looks to the future			1
it is the perfect message to convey			2
@entity32 : be like you @entity32 is an artist who shows it 's not just the artists from @entity0 who have a big future ahead of them			1
we rate the young man from @entity39 so highly that we made sure @entity40 shot an acoustic session with him and one of the songs we were lucky enough to hear live was " be like you			0
" the singer / songwriter 's second single is getting huge support from the @entity7 radio stations like @entity50 and @entity51 , and rightly so			0
he is re-injecting true soul music back in the public eye and i can only support this as soul music is the first genre of music i fell in love with			1
it was one of the reasons why i started up the @entity11 in 1996			1
apart from , of course , @entity64 , there are not enough musicians out there who can really touch your innerself like the greats , such as @entity71 , could many years ago			0
obviously , these artists are plying their trade in the @entity7 , but @entity32 , however , is getting the recognition he deserves quicker than most			1
@entity76 : 25/8 one of my favorite all - time artists @entity76 returned this year			1
i was so happy to see the release of her new album " @entity82 ... @entity83 " as she seems to be back to her best			0
one of @entity86 's most important and critically - acclaimed artists , she has had many problems in her personal life , but with pain comes acceptance , then joy , and @entity76 is able to put them all behind her to create some of the best r&b songs to come out of @entity94 in the past 20 years			1
" 25/8 " is a track that meets all of the criteria of what @entity76 is all about			1
it 's soul meets hip hop with her rough vocals complementing the track			0
it 's safe to say nobody in the world could cover a @entity76 song and get the same raw and powerful emotion			1
a true great among us and like a fine wine , only gets better with age			0
@entity114 ft @entity115 : earthquake probably the nicest man in the music business , @entity114 has become a big name in the music business without even releasing records , but producing some of the @entity7 scene 's most successful tracks in the past couple of years			1
he was the mastermind behind @entity115 's hits " pass out , " " @entity127 " and " @entity128 , " as well as putting his mark on ms @entity131 's comeback single " @entity133 " and @entity135 's hit " @entity136			0
" after giving us a little taste of what labrinth the artist is about last year with " @entity143 , " the man from @entity138 brought the year to a standstill with his new track " earthquake			0
" featuring the amazing @entity115 , the whole song from start to finish displays a new level of excitement and constantly surprises you since it works on so many levels			0
when the song goes to a standstill and you hear a dark version of the chorus before the beat kicks in is a stroke of genius that only @entity114 could come up with			0
not to mention , the video is surreal ! 2012 will be a big year for @entity114			0
@entity163 : settle down @entity163 is a surprise choice of mine as about a month ago , i did n't know she existed			0
but our new website editor brought her to my attention as he listens to a wide range of genres and played a song by @entity173 in the office called " somebody i used to know , " which features @entity163			0
apparently she experiments with jazz and soul music so i gave her a listen and now i ca n't get enough of her track " @entity180			1
" the young @entity181 reminds me of a young @entity182 with a voice that does n't suit her at all since it seems like her vocal chords have aged beyond her current time			2
i believe in finding new artists as you ca n't just live in the past when it comes to music			1
music styles will change and it 's important for us to keep up to date with the new sounds			2
i predict @entity163 is going to be around for a long time			0
