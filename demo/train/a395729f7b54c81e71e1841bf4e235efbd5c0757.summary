@entity0 -- the first man on the moon marked the 40th anniversary of his historic achievement with characteristic understatement monday , calling the program that put him on the lunar surface " a good thing to do			1

during brief remarks at the museum , he said the mission was the climax of a " staggeringly complex " endeavor that " required the very best in creativity , determination and perseverance that could be assembled in the @entity32 workplace			0
" " those successes were very impressive 40 years ago , but they were not miraculous , " @entity14 said			1
" they were the result of the imagination and inventive minds of the people in the @entity40 project since its inception eight years earlier			1
" the july 20 , 1969 , moon landing followed four test missions and came just two years after a fire that killed the first @entity40 crew			1
a seventh flight , @entity40 , was forced to abort its landing after an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft ; the crew used its lunar lander as a " lifeboat " for much of their harrowing return to @entity56			1
@entity14 called the @entity57 " a superb national enterprise " that " left a lasting imprint on society and history			1
" " our knowledge of the moon increased a thousandfold and more , " he said			2
" @entity66 were developed for interplanetary navigation and travel			0
our home planet has been seen from afar , and that perspective has caused us to think about its and our significance			0
children inspired by the excitement of space flight have come to appreciate the wonder of science , the beauty of mathematics and the precision of engineering			0
" he concluded , " @entity40 was a good thing to do			1
" while fellow moonwalker @entity12 appeared on an episode of " @entity84 , " wrote a memoir that frankly discussed his bouts with alcoholism and depression and once punched out a conspiracy theorist who argued the landing was faked , @entity14 retreated to quiet obscurity after leaving @entity93			2

he has given only occasional interviews in the intervening decades and stopped signing autographs because he discovered his signature was being sold for profit			0
@entity13 , who flew the @entity15 command module @entity108 while @entity12 and @entity14 took the lander @entity110 to the lunar surface , went on to serve as director of the @entity17			1
@entity108 is now a prize exhibit at the facility			0
earlier , the crew met with president @entity10 , who hailed them as " genuine @entity32 heroes " and " the touchstone for excellence in exploration and discovery			2
" @entity10 said the landing continued to inspire young people to study math and science in hopes of becoming astronauts			0
as a boy in @entity129 , @entity10 recalled , he would go out with his grandfather to welcome back astronauts from missions that concluded with @entity134 landings			0
" i remember waving @entity32 flags and my grandfather telling me that the @entity40 mission was an example of how @entity32 can do anything they put their minds to , " he said			2
