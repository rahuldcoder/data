" a court ordered the brothel to close around november 2012 , after a lawyer argued before a judge on behalf of neighbors in the area			1
the case came at a time when radical islamists had launched a campaign in several parts of @entity4 against the licensed brothels			0
the head of the delegation told @entity11 , " there is no problem			0
... we were attacked by the @entity58 , radical @entity59 , who attacked us and closed the premises by force			2

" we have to go back to our line of work because we are facing major financial catastrophes , " she added			1
@entity11 told @entity20 , " these women are @entity4 and they have rights , and our duty is to serve them			2
i am ready to listen to everyone on the condition that i have the time and if their demands are possible and can be addressed in such circumstances ; they have the right to be heard by everyone			0
