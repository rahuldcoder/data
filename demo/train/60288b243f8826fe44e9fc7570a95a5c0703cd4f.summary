@entity0 , @entity1 -- children point at the glass as a long train rounds the bend and @entity7 passes overhead			1
outside , a flashing red signal tells neighbors it 's time to hop aboard			2
welcome to @entity11 and @entity13 's indoor train garden , a collection of model trains the couple have been sharing with friends and neighbors every holiday season for nearly 15 years			1
" we love it , that 's why we do it , " says @entity13			2
the collection began with a train @entity11 's father gave him as an infant 62 years ago			1
@entity11 still has the train , and many more			1
the garden has grown to include 11 intertwined train sets , divided into summer and winter scenes			1
once the collection outgrew their house , the @entity31 built a detached building the size of a two - car garage specifically to hold the display year round			1
" i venture to say , each year i put at least a hundred hours in here , " @entity11 says			1
" that 's before @entity39 and setting everything up and changing this around ... and fine - tuning , fixing anything that 's broke			0
" last year , more than 1,200 people followed the lit path to the backyard garage , including regulars like @entity47 and his two children , who come at least once a week when the display is open			1
" they 've been looking forward to it for about three months now , " says @entity47 , who brought his children on opening night as he has for five years			0
" and then ... when it closes [ they 're ] looking forward to it next year			1
" besides the regulars , there are first - time guests like @entity59 , who came with her granddaughter			0
" it 's absolutely wonderful , " @entity62 said , " all of the extra things that they 've added , it 's just fabulous			0
" the collection can be overwhelming at first , with all of the sounds and flashing lights that fill the building			1
the miniature villages and communities are filled with happy people , living a peaceful life in a different time			0
with all the wires out of sight , it looks like magic			0
the @entity31 have worked consistently to make additions to the train garden			1
" basically it is an all year thing , but the final push is from september ' til now " june said			2
adds @entity11 , " it usually takes us a month or so to get the backyard here all decorated			0
... it 's quite a bit of work			0
" there 's a separate garage for repairs			2
" there 's a train we added this year that has 30 cars on it			1
well , it 's 29 cars plus the engine makes it 30 , " @entity11 says			0
" i 've tested it a little bit -- i 'm hoping we do n't have any problems with that , cause that 's a pretty long train			2
so it runs the whole length of a board , approximately 30 feet			0
" this year @entity11 , a retired police officer , also added a scene with a doughnut delivery truck being robbed as a police cruiser comes to the rescue			2
the regular guests enjoy seeing the new details , but they also come to see @entity116			0
" @entity116 is here every night , every night until @entity39 , and most of [ the children ] bring me their wish list , " @entity11 says behind the white beard and red suit			0
the @entity31 open their collection for 20 nights each year leading up to @entity39			1
the evening routine begins with setting up the outside lights and inflatable decorations			0
visitors know they 've reached the right place when they see the brightest house on the street , complete with holiday music			1
the front window of the house has a replica of the leg - shaped lamp from the classic holiday movie " @entity137 "			2
" it does my heart good to see the little sparkle in their eyes when they come around and see @entity116 or see the trains , and it lights my heart up			0
