once a year , if you drive just several hours north of @entity1 into @entity4 's arid @entity3 semi-desert , you 'll come across a tented town in the middle of a vast expanse of nothing , like a surreal mirage			1
here , huge sculptures punctuate the sky and the desert floor is dotted with art works , from multi-story creations to a field of tiny mushrooms that light up at night			0
thousands of people , looking like extras from a hundred different movie sets , wear elaborate costumes and body paint and wander around , giving out hot dogs , popcorn , drinks , ice creams and yoga lessons			0
there 's a circus , a post office , a gingerbread house filled with sweets , a @entity33 alpine chalet , a saloon straight out of the @entity35 and nearly a hundred other themed camps including dance floors , bars and coffee stations			0
this is @entity41 , @entity4 's most unique , unusual , exhilarating and mind - blowing festival			1
based on @entity44 , which draws 70,000 participants to @entity48 's @entity47 each year , @entity41 is not just a music or arts festival			1
the event , held at the end of april , is a chance to experience a different ( albeit temporary ) world where creativity , self - reliance , self - expression and communal effort are championed			1
other than ice there 's nothing to buy , and each participant has to bring everything they need to survive , including shelter , water and food			0
fiery spectacles it 's run on a gifting -- rather than bartering -- economy , where each person is supposed to contribute something as a gift , and all the entertainment ( ranging from circus shows to @entity78 performances ) and art is conceived of , created and produced by the participants themselves			1
over the last three nights of the week - long event , the art works burn in mesmerizing fiery spectacles			1
when it 's all over , everything is packed up , leaving no trace that this parallel universe ever existed			0
@entity41 has been running for nine years , increasing in size each year -- 9,000 people attended the 2014 event			1
out of 130 regional events scattered across the globe affiliated with @entity44 , it 's the largest			1
its worldwide fame is growing too -- each year more international participants travel to this remote corner of @entity4 just to attend the festival , including @entity99 , many of whom declare that @entity41 is how @entity44 was two decades ago , before it became so big			1
for many participants , attending @entity41 is a life - changing experience -- it 's hard to come out of a week in the desert without looking at the world in a different way			1
one thing 's for sure : it 's definitely worth traveling to @entity4 for			1
here are 12 reasons why you should attend the next @entity41 , which takes place in april 2015			1
the art installations the creativity and effort that goes into the art works ( 95 of which were set up at the 2014 event ) of @entity41 , is simply astounding			1
some , like " @entity118 , " made up of six timber cones rising up as high as 100 feet -- a statement against fracking in the @entity3 -- have a political stance			2
others , such as " reflection " -- a giant wooden construction of a man 's torso , arms and face rising out of the ground , which became the backdrop of a laser and projection mapping show -- are just incredibly beautiful structures			2
smaller art works are also created to inspire a childlike sense of delight -- think a telephone booth where you can " call @entity141 " and a wigwam made of wigs			0
to participate @entity41 is run on 11 guiding principles , which act like a manifesto and a kind of constitutional self - governing law			2
one of these principles is participation -- everyone who attends @entity41 is expected to get involved in some way			2
most people take part by dressing in elaborate costumes , others run a bar or a dance floor , others create art or help build something , and around 1,000 each year sign up as volunteers			0
by participating in @entity41 , everyone becomes part of the event , and it 's a lot more fun than just being a spectator			1
the burnings for many , watching the spectacle of giant art works burning with a crowd of thousands gasping in awe in union is a major highlight of @entity41			2
there 's something inherently primal about being close to a huge blaze and something deeply profound in the fiery destruction of art that took months to create			2
the burnings are beautiful and spectacular , but on a deeper level they speak to ideas of transience and presence			0
to experience a gifting economy it 's extremely liberating to spend a week without taking out your wallet , but what 's even more amazing is experiencing the generosity of strangers at @entity41			1
the idea is that everyone gives out unconditional gifts -- it 's heartwarming to receive unexpected treats ( especially things like handmade jewelry or uplifting messages baked into cookies )			0
even more so to give out the gifts that you 've brought			0
to experience survival mode those attending @entity41 get a taste of what it 's like to survive in an inhospitable environment of heat , cold , wind and dust storms that leave a layer of sand over everything			2
they need to bring a tent , cook food over a gas stove ( or eat crackers and tinned sardines ) and ration water use			0
there are toilets but no showers and nowhere to buy water			0
going into survival mode is part of the fun of @entity41 -- and it also means that when participants get back into " civilization " they 'll hopefully learn to look at the simplest things -- like running water out of a tap -- with new found appreciation			0
theme camps set around a big circle known as the @entity238 are over 100 theme camps -- public spaces that all offer something different and form the key components of the festival			0
there are massage parlors , chill spaces , photo booths , cocktail bars , a general store , post office and even a swimming pool			0
each year they 're different , so you never know what to expect			0
music at night , @entity41 turns into one giant party , as music blasts from dozens of small , big and almost hidden dance floors			2
expect to hear an eclectic range of genres -- everything from hip hop and blues to trance and deep house -- and catch some of @entity4 's best djs playing sets			1
mutant vehicles most people bring bicycles to @entity41 to get around -- the event is spread over a large area			2
but the best methods of transportation are the many mutant vehicles , or art cars , that traverse the desert town with no set route or direction			0
visitors can jump onto the back of a big purple snail , a porcupine or a rhino , or sail across the horizon in a pirate ship			0
the location not many tourists venture into the @entity290 , @entity4 's largest and most sparsely populated province , but they 're missing out on the starkly beautiful desert landscapes of the @entity3			1
@entity41 is set on a farm alongside the @entity293 -- an underrated reserve that 's well worth a visit on the way back to @entity1			1
the sky with its huge horizons and cotton wool clouds , the @entity3 has some of @entity4 's best sunsets -- each afternoon 's sky becomes a painting of pink , apricot and dusky purple , an exquisite backdrop of art works punctuating the sky			1
it looks more like a movie set on another planet than a festival			0
at night the sky explodes into a thick blanket of stars -- for those who can tear themselves away from the dance floors , there 's some epic stargazing to be had			0

participants will need to bring all their own supplies to the event			0
@entity41 's @entity331 at @entity332 details what to bring and how to prepare .			2
