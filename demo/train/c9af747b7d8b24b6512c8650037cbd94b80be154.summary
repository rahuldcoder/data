-- video storytelling can be a very powerful thing			1
moving images coupled with compelling sound can transport a viewer to a different place , inside the story			1
to achieve this level of storytelling you must be a technically sound shooter			1
here are the basic tools and tips needed to become a great video storyteller			1
have a plan before you actually start shooting , be sure you have a game plan			1
think about your subject and what kind of shots you need to best tell the story			1
thinking ahead will help you avoid being overwhelmed when you start shooting			1
also , be sure to think about your equipment ahead of time			1
be sure to have enough charged batteries and spare memory			1
there 's nothing worse than setting up a shoot only to realize you 're out of juice			1
do n't forget about composition one thing that is easy to lose sight of during a fast - paced news gathering shoot is composition			1
this can result in bland , forgettable material			1
thoughtful shot composition can really make your footage stand out			2
generally , it is boring to just center the subject of your shot , so instead , use the rule of thirds			2
pretend your frame has evenly spaced lines running throughout it , two horizontally and two vertically			2
the points where the lines intersect are where you want to have the most important elements of the shot			2
if your shot seems boring , try to get up high or down low			2
presenting your viewer with an alternative to the shoulder / tripod - height view will help create a more dynamic shot			2
and do n't forget to be creative ! think about what angle a person would not normally see and see how it looks through your camera			2
have a focal point each shot should have something for the viewer to focus on or else the viewer will focus on nothing			2
use the rule of thirds to decide where to put this focal point in your frame			2
capture action it is very important to capture action in your shots , but do n't get sucked into following every movement			0
allow your subjects to move in and out of the frame , as this gives a much better sense of motion			0
get a variety of shots always make sure you have the following shots : wide shots to set the scene , medium to give context and to tell the basic story , and tight shots to give details that the viewer would n't normally see			0
once you have a variety of shots of different scenes , you can start telling a cohesive visual story			0
stabilize every shot train yourself to always use a tripod or monopod when shooting			0
shaky footage can totally distract the view from an otherwise great shot			0
this takes discipline and tripods can be cumbersome , but your material will improve greatly if stabilized			1
limit camera moves zooms , pans and tilts			0
when done carefully and deliberately they can be ok , but most of they time they distract from what should be the focal point of the shot : the action			0
pay attention to light light is your friend			0
beautiful light during the golden hour ( first and last hour of sunlight during the day ) will be warm and soft , shooting at that time of day will make footage pop. be aware of light			0
you can use it to silhouette your subject or create a nice rim light effect			0
also look out for low light situations and try to have an external source of light if possible			0
hold your shots try to hold your shots for at least five seconds , this will make life - in - edit much easier , and do n't talk while holding these shots ! do n't forget about audio poor audio can kill video			1
always use an external mic when possible			0
if you ca n't , be sure to find a very quiet place to conduct your interviews			0
use manual settings as much as possible yes , there are a lot of buttons and features on your camera			0
learn them and use them ! manual controls are much more reliable and give you total control over your shots , more than any auto features your camera may have			0
practice , practice , practice like most things in life , the only way to become a better shooter is to practice			0
the more you shoot , the more comfortable you will become with your camera so you can focus less on camera settings and more on getting those perfect shots			0
