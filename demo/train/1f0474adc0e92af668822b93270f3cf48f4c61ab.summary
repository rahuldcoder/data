-- who shot @entity2 ? why is zombie @entity3 taking a shower ? and can @entity6 really pull off a cowboy hat with a suit ? a new incarnation of the groundbreaking television saga that raised these questions will return to @entity12 june 13			1
the new series is n't just a remake ; it 's a continuation of the original , which means that television 's most notorious family is back in the @entity18 but the city has changed a lot since we last checked in with @entity2 and company			1
for instance , it lost a lot of oil derricks and gained a few modern marvels , including a signature bridge and a stadium that rivals the construction of the @entity31			0
women 's hairstyles are n't as high and neither are the peaks of 10 - gallon @entity36			0
the @entity37 are now a source of great embarrassment and the @entity40 are the pride of the metroplex			0
but that 's not to say there is n't still plenty of the unapologetic glam and high - society western culture celebrated in the show 's original 14 seasons			1
the @entity50 clan would feel just as at home in today 's @entity18 as they did during the series ' heyday			1
here are a few spots where you just might run into them			0
' @entity18 ' vs. @entity18 : where tv stops and reality begins five sixty by @entity60 at @entity61 built in 1978 , the same year " @entity18 " premiered on @entity62 , @entity61 served as @entity18 ' most iconic building for three decades before the " @entity65 " underwent a much - needed makeover			1
now @entity61 boasts one of the finest dining experiences in @entity18 , with a 560 - foot - high revolving restaurant and an @entity70 fusion menu crafted by celebrity chef @entity60			1
@entity71 : @entity73 's best affordable beach resorts @entity75 's @entity74 @entity2 would n't be caught dead in this dive bar that 's covered floor to ceiling in graffiti , photos , stickers , neon lights and mounted horns			0
but a younger @entity50 would feel right at home at @entity75 's , where you 're likely to see just as many businessmen as you do cowboys			0
the 49 - year - old honky tonk features some of the best burgers in @entity18 and live music almost every night ( usually of the country and western persuasion ) , and you 're more than welcome to join the trove of two - steppers , whether you 're wearing designer or dungarees			1
@entity97 @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , and @entity104 are just a few of the high - end shopping options available at this 20,000 - square - foot outdoor mall			0
you might find one of the @entity50 boys shopping for a $ 130,000 rifle at the @entity111 , or a soon - to - be mrs. @entity112 picking out an @entity114 wedding dress at @entity115			0
@entity71 : secret hotels of @entity118 's @entity117 @entity119 of course , the @entity120 would be nothing without the world - renowned @entity119			1
the home base of @entity18 ' most famous tv dynasty actually sits just outside the city , in @entity126 , @entity127			1
the ranch is still alive and well , and has served as a tourist destination and an event and conference center since the ' 80s			0
many of @entity18 ' most elite soirees are held on the property , including the @entity136 , which draws in thousands of guests donning their finest @entity139 attire			2
@entity140 on @entity141 this time around the @entity142 are spending about as much time around @entity18 ' @entity140 as they are around @entity119			2
members of the cast and crew stayed in the @entity140 on @entity141 , a loft apartment building that lures creative spirits and young professionals , and provides the city 's best views of the @entity18 skyline			1
many of the scenes were also filmed in @entity140 , which originally served as the home of the historic @entity158 's @entity157			0
@entity159 and @entity160 @entity18 ' new stunning , state - of - the - art opera house is the most prestigious venue in the world that warmly welcomes cowboy boots			2
eager to promote culture in @entity127 , @entity168 and @entity160 donated $ 42 million with a vision of promoting great opera to help @entity18 become a top international city			1
located in the @entity173 , the opera house has certainly upped the city 's cultural cred			2
in 2010 , the @entity160 hosted @entity18 ' first opera premiere , with @entity178 's " @entity177 , " and with each new show , the venue has continued to help fulfill the @entity182 ' dream			1
@entity183 " @entity18 " veteran @entity184 ( @entity112 ) and newcomer @entity185 ( @entity186 ) were spotted filming at this minimalist @entity188 restaurant set in an old catholic school house , the first in the city to teach @entity193 children			1
with a chalkboard wall , notebook - paper menus and original beams sitting below glass flooring , you wo n't soon forget the trendy restaurant 's past life			2
but history is n't all @entity202 has to offer -- the eatery also features the city 's largest patio garden and one of the longest pre-seat waiting periods			2
so be sure to make a reservation			0
@entity209 on @entity210 for starters , it 's so elegant it 's known simply as the mansion			0
it 's also the most historic and elite hotel in @entity18 , and the bar and restaurant are no exception			1
the @entity219 's recent renovation enhanced the den 's club ambiance , with cognac - colored leather walls covered in fine art and shelves filled with leather - bound books			0
you half - expect to see @entity2 sitting out on the terrace overlooking @entity210 , sipping on his signature @entity228 and @entity231 cocktail			0
@entity71 : getting away , celebrity style ( like @entity0 , @entity12 is a division of @entity233			0
) have you been to @entity18 ? where do you hang out ? share your tips for visitors below .			2
