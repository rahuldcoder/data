-- a pro-privacy e-mail service long used by @entity3 leaker @entity2 abruptly shut down thursday , blaming a secret @entity5 court battle it has been fighting for six weeks — one that it seems to be losing so far			1
" i have been forced to make a difficult decision : to become complicit in crimes against the @entity5 people or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down @entity12 , " owner @entity13 wrote in a statement			1
" after significant soul searching , i have decided to suspend operations			2
" based in @entity17 , @entity12 attracted attention last month when @entity3 leaker @entity2 used an e-mail account with the service to invite human rights workers and lawyers to a press conference in the @entity26 airport where he was then confined			1
a @entity28 crypto key apparently registered by @entity2 with a @entity12 address suggests he 's favored the service since january 2010 — well before he became the most important whistleblower in a generation			1
@entity13 posted this message thursday announcing the shutdown : my @entity35 , i have been forced to make a difficult decision : to become complicit in crimes against the @entity5 people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down @entity12			1
after significant soul searching , i have decided to suspend operations			2
i wish that i could legally share with you the events that led to my decision			0
i feel you deserve to know what 's going on -- the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this			0
unfortunately , @entity48 has passed laws that say otherwise			0
as things currently stand , i can not share my experiences over the last six weeks , even though i have twice made the appropriate requests			2
what 's going to happen now ? we 've already started preparing the paperwork needed to continue to fight for the @entity56 in the @entity57			0
a favorable decision would allow me resurrect @entity12 as an @entity5 company			1
this experience has taught me one very important lesson : without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent , i would _ strongly _ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the @entity5			1
sincerely , @entity13 @entity69 , @entity12 defending the constitution is expensive ! help us by donating to the @entity72 here			1
@entity74 , it 's reasonable to assume @entity13 has been fighting either a @entity75 seeking customer information — which comes by default with a gag order — or a full - blown search or eavesdropping warrant			2
court records show that , in june , @entity12 complied with a routine search warrant targeting a child pornography suspect in a federal case in @entity85			1
that suggests that @entity13 is n't a privacy absolutist			0
whatever compelled him to shut down now must have been exceptional			2
a voicemail to @entity12 went unreturned thursday			1
@entity12 has 350,000 users who are n't @entity2 , and some are decidedly unhappy with @entity13 's decision , judging by a flood of angry comments posted to @entity12 's @entity95 page thursday afternoon			1
" too bad that i payed some years in advance to keep up the good work that now turns out to be terminated without any warning , " wrote one user			0
" i relied on this service which is basic for my private as professional online communication and have no idea how to migrate mails and recover mails being sent that never reached me in the past 18 hours			2
" " i have my @entity107 account and everything on @entity12 , " wrote another			1
" please have the servers running so that we can migrate our services			0
" " how am i supposed to migrate ? " a third user added			0
" some services require a confirmation sent to the old email address to be able to switch			0
i ca n't believe this			0
i just switched to @entity12 only a couple of weeks ago to get away from @entity118 snooping my shit			1
" a minority of commenters were more supportive			0
" @entity125 s --- , you guys are crying over your steam accounts , " wrote one			0
" just change your email to something else			0
@entity12 either had to roll over for the government , compromising our privacy , or shut down service			1
be happy @entity13 shut it down instead of rolling over			2
