-- @entity1 is one of the lucky retail employees who will enjoy @entity3 without having to rush to work			1
but a brother - in - law who works at @entity6 is n't as lucky			0
the @entity7 , @entity8 , castle is open for a 5 p.m. show on @entity3 , which means @entity1 's family is eating dinner around noon to accommodate his schedule			1
and , it 's not the only @entity3 joust on the calendar ; shows are scheduled in all nine @entity6 castles in @entity19 , with most offering discounted tickets			1
" he enjoys his job , and he knows working nights and weekends and some holidays is a part of it , " said @entity1 , a 30 - year - old resident of @entity21 , @entity8			1
" but it affects his family , too , and it 's not fair to us , either			0
" it 's the same sentiment behind a handful of petitions , @entity33 groups and social media gripes about people being called in to work on @entity3 -- not only in retail but in the service industry and entertainment			1
@entity1 created a petition on @entity43 asking @entity6 to cancel its @entity3 and @entity44 shows so employees can spend the holidays with their families			1
" your employees , from servers , to performers and management , come together five days a week as a team to bring a great show to your patrons			0
do you not feel that your hard working employees deserve these holidays to spend with their families ? " she said in the petition , which has earned nearly 2,500 signatures since launching in late october			1
@entity6 did not respond to repeated requests for comment			0
the petition is one of several on @entity43 this year challenging what 's known as the " @entity67 creep " into one of the busiest shopping days of the year			1
while most of the petitions target retailers , @entity1 's petition highlights the plight of nonretail workers who also work on @entity3			2
other petitions target malls and shopping centers on behalf of retail employees as well as maintenance and security workers who also have to report to work on holidays			0
it 's no surprise why businesses keep opening early			0
the @entity84 expects shoppers to spend $ 602.1 billion in november and december , a 3.9 % increase from last year 's holiday shopping season			1
but , just as the creep gets earlier each year , with @entity90 announcing plans to open its doors at 6 a.m. and others opening later in the day , consumers began rallying earlier this year			0
you 've probably seen the evidence on @entity33 , with friends pledging to " @entity97 on @entity3 " through badges on their walls and in profile pictures starting in october			1
the eponymous @entity33 group responsible for the badges launched in mid-october , earning more than 40,000 likes in less than a month			1
shoppers pledge to boycott black friday thursday their motivations tend to intersect around fighting " corporate greed " and " reclaiming @entity3 " for families			2
posts on the page refer back to the " good old days " when stores were closed on @entity3 and holiday shopping sales did n't start until after @entity3			2
it 's a cause that @entity113 of @entity114 , @entity115 , feels passionately about even though his shopping options are limited thanks to @entity115 blue laws that restrict business openings on holidays			0
what bugs him are the @entity44 decorations and holiday sales that start well before @entity3 has even begun			2
" retailers are doing an end run around @entity3 , extending @entity44 back because that 's the mercantile holiday , " said @entity113 , a fan of the @entity125 on @entity126			2
" they 've found out that you really ca n't sell much through @entity3 itself			0
the most you can sell is the bird			0
" @entity113 says he is doing what little he can by pledging not to shop on @entity3 and encouraging others to do the same through his own @entity33 group , @entity3 comes first , which has more than 1,110 followers			1
the goal is n't to " bring big corporations to their knees , " he said wryly , but to postpone holiday shopping until after @entity3			2
" i 'm not looking to do anything serious or harmful to the @entity144 economy , i 'm just looking to scale it back , " he said			0
@entity1 is also realistic about her goals			0
the @entity6 shows will go on this @entity3 , and a show is still scheduled for christmas day , which has become the new focus of her efforts			1
" it 's not retail , it 's not an essential business , " she said			0
" why ca n't they have one day off ? "			0
