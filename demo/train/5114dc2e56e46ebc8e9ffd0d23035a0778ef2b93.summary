in the absence of a proper voters ' roll and credible international observers , no one can honestly say with any degree of certainty whether last week 's elections reflected the will of the @entity9 people			1
one thing is certain -- the numbers simply do not add up			2
and is n't it strange that there have been no jubilant celebrations by the " winners ? " it 's as though the @entity17 and @entity18 , elected to yet another term as @entity9 's president , ca n't quite believe it themselves			1
the general mood across the nation is one of despondency			0
no one knows what to do next			0
it would seem the will of the people has not triumphed at all			0
riot police patrol quiet streets			2
no one sings or dances			0
what happened on july 31 was a demonstration of what can be done by a small group of people who have everything to lose and who have spent more than 30 years cementing their grip on power and wealth			0
it certainly was not a popularity contest			0
memories of the 2008 election -- burnt and lacerated bodies , weeping girls and women who had been raped , swollen , bleeding feet and dead bodies -- were fresh in the minds of many			2
@entity57 : western nations question @entity9 poll results the @entity17 's " victory " must be considered in the light of the following : this is a country where 95 % of the population is unemployed ; an estimated 25 % live and work in the diaspora to keep their relatives back home fed and at school ; 15 % are orphans ( largely as a result of the @entity72 )			1
it is therefore pretty easy to buy people -- and votes			0
all those in the top echelons of the army , the police , the judiciary and the body responsible for elections are hand - picked , self - avowed @entity17 loyalists -- rewarded over the years via a well - orchestrated patronage system with land , farming implements , luxury vehicles , plasma tvs , diamonds and business opportunities			1
@entity18 is a very wily politician			1
after losing the election in 2008 , he and his generals threw everything into this election -- determined to win at all costs			2
they left nothing to chance			0
they also enlisted the help of the controversial @entity102 company @entity101 , which has been accused of manipulating the vote in @entity104 during the last election			2
the registrar general 's office was used to disenfranchise young people mainly in the urban areas , and to overstate the number of old people in rural areas over 80			0
according to their own figures , the @entity113 registered just 8 % of those in the 18 - 19 age group -- and 220 % of those in the over- 80 age group , according to analysis by the @entity119 , an ngo based in @entity120			0
younger people tend to vote for the @entity122 , led by @entity123 , @entity18 's main rival , and older people for the long - time president 's @entity17			1
the office also disenfranchised millions of people in the diaspora , despite having signed up to the @entity131 election guidelines , which stipulate that provisions should be made for those in the diaspora to vote			2
a chaotic registration process registered just 1.8 million voters in the urban areas that are a stronghold for @entity123 's @entity122 , many of whom spent days queuing up to vote			1
hundreds of thousands were disenfranchised -- either their names had been removed completely from voter rolls , or they appeared in a different ward or even a different constituency			1
the voter 's roll was only made available to parties other than @entity17 on the eve of the election after a @entity152 injunction had been granted , which meant that other parties did not have the time to raise the alarm about the myriad irregularities			1
neither could people check that their names were on the list , and in the right place			0
this caused enormous confusion on the day and many would - be voters simply gave up			0
the opposition @entity122 party and civil observers have documented thousands of examples of impossible numbers related to the election			1
in the rural area of @entity172 , for instance , 21,000 people allegedly voted in 12 hours at 15 polling stations -- that 's one voter every two seconds			2
no village in @entity9 has that many adults , and the process of finding one 's name on the list , dipping a finger in the special ink and placing one 's x next to a candidate would clearly take longer than 120 seconds			1
there was documented evidence of @entity17 bussing rural people into urban areas to vote			1
although their names did not appear on the roll , they had voting slips produced by the registrar 's office which allowed them to cast their votes			0
it is believed that this is what led to the @entity122 losing most of its urban seats			0
@entity17 covertly continued to enroll more voters right up until the eve of the poll , after the @entity202 refused to extend the registration days			2
the @entity205 and @entity131 observers brushed this off as inconsequential			0
@entity208 province consistently voted for @entity123 in the past , yet in this election @entity18 made almost a clean sweep			1
these are people who hate @entity17 -- people who have bitter memories of the @entity214 genocide allegedly perpetrated by @entity18 's men in the early 1980s			1
it is inconceivable that they would vote en masse for @entity17			2
@entity218 also played a huge role in the contest			0
in the weeks leading up to the election , and even as early as january when @entity18 first started agitating for elections to take place , the @entity9 and other independent media were inundated with reports from all over the country of threats by @entity17 's traditional leaders , youth militia , army and police officers of a repeat of the 2008 violence if the party and @entity18 did not win			1
there is , of course , some support for @entity18 in the rural areas , where he has given hundreds of thousands of families land , agricultural inputs and food -- which was given as humanitarian aid by the international community and re-bagged and distributed in @entity18 's name strictly to @entity17 members during the past 15 years			1
many families were threatened with the loss of their land and homes if @entity17 did not win in their area			1
police officers and their families were warned that they would lose their homes if @entity18 did not win the election			1
add to this the tight control by @entity17 of the mass media the constant demonization of @entity123 , his @entity122 party and @entity262 sanctions , and the exhaustion of a populace ground down by decades of poverty , lack of access to independent information , violence and the threat of violence -- and you begin to understand the toxic recipe for a @entity17 " success " at the polls			1
the @entity122 also failed @entity9 on several counts during the five years since they won the election but were forced by the @entity131 into a power - " sharing " coalition with @entity17			1
these failures included @entity123 's indiscretions after his wife died , corruption in urban councils controlled by the party , failure to bring meaningful legislative change through parliament and greed on the part of some mps who sided with @entity17 in pursuit of more pay and perks			1
i doubt there will be any serious violence now			0
people are shell - shocked and @entity18 's loyal forces are well prepared with @entity300 weapons and @entity102 water cannons			2
riot squads are out in full force			0
@entity305 's options are limited			0
he seems inclined to appeal to the @entity306 for a nullification and a re-run			0
but it is highly unlikely that judgement would go in his favour given the compromised nature of the judiciary			0
just a few weeks before the election , @entity18 packed the courts with hand - picked loyalists			1
the @entity122 could appeal to the @entity131 to nullify the result			2
but this is also unlikely to succeed given that the @entity131 and the @entity205 have already endorsed the results			0
passive resistance in a country where 95 % of people are unemployed is a non-starter			0
any other resistance would be met with greater force and give @entity18 the chance he is waiting for -- to lock up all @entity122 leaders .			2
