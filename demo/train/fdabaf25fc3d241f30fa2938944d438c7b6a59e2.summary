-- remember when you were 12 years old and you 'd pass notes in class , making snide remarks about members of the opposite sex ? remember the electricity that shot through school when word went around that there was going to be a schoolyard rumble ? remember the rollercoasters of emotions , the whispers of gossip , the crying because your best friend betrayed you , the molehills made into mountains ? if life is just like high school , then the @entity20 might be an age group lower			1
much of our digital world means never having to leave junior high school behind			1
sure , the @entity26 has plenty of mature , resourceful people who create clever online projects or crowdsource solutions to global problems			1
but some experts also believe it perpetuates childhood			2
@entity35 , a communications professor at @entity36 in @entity37 who 's written a great deal about online civility , sees a reverse of a pattern created by television			1
if , as cultural critic @entity44 asserted , tv ended childhood -- the medium provided an impetus for young people to act older , which created hand - wringing about generations growing up too quickly -- the @entity20 has done the opposite , she says			1
" the internet and digital media have produced this ' @entity55 effect ' where we never grow up , we 're perpetual children , we never have to be responsible for anything -- we keep this juvenile mentality , " she says			1
indeed , the @entity26 has a clique for every would - be adolescent -- class clowns , bullies , drama queens and fanboys			1
( there 's plenty of room for geeks and nerds , too			2
) they all get to indulge in their petty squabbles , and few of them show signs of growing up			2
looking for a fight on the playground blacktop ? check out @entity76 and @entity77 , where complete strangers assault each other with name calling			2
want to be part of the popular crowd ? try @entity83 , full of instant celebrities who have done little except mix @entity85 in their mouths			2
meanwhile , mainstream news and culture sites indulge in instant - gratification come - ons , from car - crash videos to galleries of kittens and puppies			2
of course , if you do n't like any of it , you 're free to post in the comments , where the level of discourse is somewhere between " this sucks " and " you suck			1
" it 's all instantaneous , thanks to the always - on aspect of digital media -- available at the swipe of a smartphone			1
who needs to think ? " we say whatever 's on our mind , " says @entity35			2
" restraint is one of the signs of adulthood , and our whole culture is celebrating a lack of restraint			2
" a squirt of dopamine , a shot of attention of course , why would n't it ? it 's really two distinct if not unrelated issues			0
on the one hand , there 's the concept of immediate satisfaction			0
it 's in the very core of our lizard brains , the cries of " @entity132 now ! " and " just do it , " the things that give us a squirt of dopamine and keep us coming back again and again			0
marketers and media people have always known its value , and the @entity20 -- in the form of catchy headlines and eye - grabbing , multi-frame galleries -- does this very well			1
and then there 's the stuff that appeals to us on a gut level , whether it 's graphic images , blunt language or a longing for attention			0
perversely , it sometimes creates an antagonistic response : a recent @entity157 survey noted that a distinguishing aspect of @entity77 chatter is its " overall negativity			0
" " @entity77 users are not representative of the public , " the survey hastened to add			0
but @entity77 users ' voices are often picked up by the wider media , which makes the wisecracks and incivility conveyed on the service even more attractive to attention - getters			1
and around and around we go			0
besides , attention is a good thing , right ? we all want to be popular , enjoy a taste of celebrity			0
digital life celebrates viral videos and @entity76 memes			1
does it matter what you said ? no -- what matters is how many people hear you say it			1
it all contributes to a potent mix , says @entity187 , a communications professor at the @entity188			0
" it 's this weird moment , " she says , reeling off such facets as the rise of youth culture , the spread of celebrities oriented to youth , politically oriented dismissals of fact and the 140 - character @entity77 culture			0
with " a rise of incivility that is completely accepted and enabled by social media , you have some kind of a brew here			1
" however , it 's a brew that gets eyeballs -- and that 's what matters to many websites , says @entity208 communications professor @entity207			1
" what do audiences reward ? " he asks , observing that an 8,000 - word investigative piece will usually lose out to a zingy tweet			1
as the media environment gets faster and faster -- now we also have 6 - second @entity215 -- nobody wants to be the guy who passes around articles that get dismissed by commenters with " tl ; dr " ( too long ; did n't read )			1
so we end up back in the schoolyard			0
says @entity207 , " we reward the emotional over the rational			1
" figuring things out sure , you 've probably heard some of these complaints before , the grousing of elders and eggheads about those darn kids and their clothes and their hair and their newfangled technology			0
critics deplored newspaper tabloids , which catered to first - generation immigrants learning the language and time - pressed laborers grabbing a few minutes to read lurid headlines on the train			0
in the early ' 60s , @entity241 chairman @entity240 famously called television " a vast wasteland , " echoing the thoughts of many who had hoped that the medium would bring about a golden age of entertainment and enlightenment -- not " @entity249 " and " @entity250			1
" it 's always something , the elitists charge			0
still , like television in the 500 - channel era , the @entity20 is many things , many of them worthwhile			0
along with the spitball - blowers and @entity260 , there are smart sites that use smart prose and smart graphics ( and are quite capable of satirizing everybody else )			0
they 're the kids who are actually trying to learn something -- respect for others , at the very least			1
ok , so they can sometimes be goody - two - shoes			0
and their voices often get drowned out by the unruly din of the digital masses			1
does that mean they should end up at wrong end of wedgies ? class ? class ? will class ever come to order ? @entity280 , a marketing strategist , sees some signs that the @entity20 is wising up a little			0
some of her clients , she says , are trying to use thoughtful whispers rather than sledgehammer amplification , talking up to customers rather than talking at them			1
the reverse did n't work , she says			0
one well - known candy gave its front page over to a @entity77 feed , inviting " every 14 - year - old idiot on @entity292 " to talk smack about the brand			0
now , " the boutique brands are saying , help us find our niche , and help us keep connected , " she says			0
" people no longer want the big campaign			1
people now want you to help figure out who they are again			1
" in other words , they 're growing up			1
@entity303 's @entity302 also credits some of the @entity20 's noise to uncertainty			2
web users are still figuring out whom to trust , how to communicate , what this new ( and it is still new ) technology can do			0
they 're like a bunch of kids getting their first surge of hormones			2
they wo n't always be bouncing off the walls			0
but , in the meantime , it 's going to take some work to leave the schoolyard			0
@entity35 , for one , is n't optimistic			0
she mentions @entity322 and his " @entity323 , " which argues that civilization relies on restraint of childish behavior			2
the @entity20 , of course , is just a reflection of our larger civilization -- and she does n't like what she sees			2
" the idea that being an adult is prized in our culture -- that idea is evaporating , " she says			2
" it 's really uncool			0

people engage in juvenile behavior online , even if they 're adults
internet and digital media have produced " @entity55 effect , " says one observer
we reward short and *punchy* , not long and thoughtful
@entity347 may be *changing* -- some marketers are *tamping* down the noise
