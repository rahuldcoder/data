-- playdates used to be as simple as , well , child 's play			1
that 's because until not so long ago , that 's all they were : a couple of kids spending a couple of hours together , shooting hoops or playing a board game while @entity11 ( natch ) , a homemaker ( natch again ) , looked in from time to time , filling the snack bowl as needed			2
fast - forward to today : your kids ' playmates are as likely to show up with a @entity17 as with their baseball - card collection , and you might be driven from the neighborhood if anyone finds out you served the kids chips instead of edamame			2
parenting : 10 reasons play makes kids smarter sending your child to someone else 's home is n't exactly a worry - free experience either			1
is the mom ( or dad , or the sitter ... hey , who 's home , anyway ? ) so focused on @entity35 that your 9 - year - old and her pal are using the oven unsupervised to make s'mores ? is your middleschooler playing video games that belong to his pal 's older brother -- or , geez , with a title like @entity45 , his parole officer ? be ready to navigate a few modern - day situations ! read on for the new rules to set you straight			1
the @entity50 : your child 's old enough to stay home briefly , and often does			1
but is it okay to leave her and her playmate home while you dash to the dry cleaner ? the solution : take the kids with you , or save your errand for another time , says @entity59 , a child and family psychotherapist in @entity61			2
" the other parent expects you to be there and be in charge , " she says			0
" you want to make sure that no one 's feelings get too hurt if there 's a squabble			2
" there are also safety considerations -- among them , a pal might not be as familiar with your home 's setup as your own child is			1
@entity75 * , of @entity76 , @entity77 , is still feeling guilty because while she was in the backyard , her daughter 's 9 - year - old pal decided to microwave some mac and cheese			1
" she reassured my daughter that she cooked all the time at her home			0
but our microwave is higher up than at her house , so it 's trickier to reach			1
the girl spilled hot pasta on her wrist and ended up with a burn that required three visits to the doctor			0
" the @entity50 : your daughter 's playmate whips out her cell and starts texting other friends while your kid twiddles her thumbs			2
the solution : " simply say ' @entity104 , since you 're here on a playdate , you guys are going to play , ' " recommends @entity109 , @entity110 , a play therapist , mother of three , and founder of @entity114 , in @entity115 , @entity116			1
as for complaining to the friend 's mom later , " i would n't , if the child quickly put the phone away , " says @entity119 © , founder of @entity121 , in @entity122			1
" but if it happens on her next visit , then at pickup , you could say to her mom , with a smile , ' maybe next time the girls can find an activity that does n't involve them being on the phone			0
' " parenting : fun at - home science experiments for your next playdate the @entity50 : you feel pressured to serve only ultra-healthy foods on playdates , even though your kid prefers potato chips			1
the solution : aim for a balance , like @entity143 * of @entity144 , @entity61 , does when her 11 - year - old daughter , @entity145 , has a friend over			1
" i first put out something healthy , like cut - up fruit , and tell the girls they can have chips after they 've finished that , " she says			1
" the other mom will know i tried to get something nutritious in them , and sometimes the kids are so full after the healthy snack that they do n't ask for anything else			2
" the @entity50 : you 've accepted a sleepover invite for your daughter , not realizing that only her pal 's divorced dad will be home			1
you 're not ok with it			2
what to do ? the solution : " call and say ' i 'm sorry , and this is about me and not you , but i just do n't feel comfortable with a man supervising an overnighter , ' " says @entity109			2
offer to host the girls at your place instead , if you can , or ask to turn the sleepover into a " late - over , " where your daughter stays only till bedtime			1
in the future , always ask who 'll be on duty before you say yes to a sleepover			2
the @entity50 : you have strict tv limits at home			0
is it ok to ask other parents not to allow the kids to veg out in front of the tube or video - game screen ? the solution : either turn down playdates at houses where the tv always seems to be on or -- more sensibly -- keep your lip zipped and let your child go			1
" if you make a request about the television , it will sound judgmental , " says @entity109			0
" besides , it 's not like you 're sending your kid over there every day , and part of letting him grow up a little is releasing some control			1
" if you really object , rather than saying so outright , you can hint around , like @entity206 * of @entity61 does			0
" i 'll say something beforehand to the mom about how nice it is outside and how my sons really love to play football in the yard , " she confesses			0
or offer to host at your place , as @entity214 of @entity215 , @entity61 , does			0
" i ca n't dictate to other parents , but i can make them happy			2
most parents are more than happy to dump their kid at your place			2
" @entity219 said , @entity220 ! parenting : creative , made - for - two activities for playdates the @entity50 : your 12 - year - old loves to play " @entity225 : @entity225 " on his @entity226			1
you 're ok with it ( you blasted plenty of " @entity230 " as a tween ) but you 're nervous about letting his pals play , since it 's rated mature and contains violence			1
( fun violence , but violence			0
) the solution : find out if the guest has the game himself			0
if he does , problem solved			0
if not , ask what his family rules are and make your decision based on that			0
you can always edit your kid 's video titles the night before the playdate			1
that way , your child wo n't lose face when @entity11 heeds her own call of duty and confiscates the game in front of his friend			2
explain why you 're doing it , so he ( hopefully ) understands			0
the @entity50 : you 're a gay parent , but not everyone knows it			0
when someone asks about your wife or husband , will your answer cost your kid pals ? the solution : @entity272 * , a @entity268 dad who has an 8 - year - old son with his partner and runs the blog gaynycdad.com , offers a humorous response : " i reply ' i am the wife ! ' the other parent can ask me more if she wants , " he laughs			0
of course , some gay parents prefer to be more circumspect			0
if your partner is n't around , you can just say " i do n't have a wife " or " my partner is at work , yes , " says @entity280 , an etiquette expert at the @entity281 at the @entity282			0
if your significant other will be home , though , advise the other parent in advance , she adds			0
some families still may not feel comfortable letting their child come over			1
no one 's saying that 's right -- with 8 million to 10 million kids in the @entity293 being raised by gay adults , that 's a lot of small - minded snubbing to do -- but as parents , they have that right			1
you may lose their friendship , but you and your child will be fine			0
parenting : most common discipline mistakes parents make the @entity50 : a family has invited your child to go to a @entity303 concert with their kid			1
should you pay for your kid 's ticket ? the solution : if you can , offer the money , says @entity119 ©			0
" do it with a big smile and say ' thank you so much ! ' so they 're not offended and think you 're doing it because you 're worried they ca n't afford it , " she adds			0
they may insist they 're treating , and that 's fine			1
if things are tight at your house , send what you can and be sure to help your kid write a thank - you note later on			1
try to host as soon as you can , too			0
@entity327 of @entity328 , @entity329 , told us on @entity35 that when another mom treated her son to two @entity334 events in two days , she watched all her kids in return			0
we 're sure her son 's mom appreciated the reciprocity ( and rest ! )			1

sending your child to another 's house for a playdate is no worry - free experience
aim for a balance of healthy foods and treats during playdates
tell other parents if you 're not comfortable with just @entity220 overseeing the sleepover
