-- the @entity2 financial crisis is poorly understood in the @entity3			1
because so many @entity3 misunderstand the crisis , they fail to appreciate how -- and how much -- the crisis threatens them			1
@entity3 tend to think ( and are encouraged by politicians to think ) of the @entity2 crisis as a debt crisis			1
governments overspent , got into debt , and now the day of reckoning is at hand			2
yet that version of the case is demonstrably untrue			0
@entity18 's debt - to - gdp ratio is substantially lower than that of the @entity3			1
@entity21 's debt - to - gdp ratio is neck and neck with the @entity3			1
yet it is @entity18 , not @entity21 , that is in trouble			0
@entity2 is not having a debt crisis			1
it is having a currency crisis			1
it 's not that @entity2 countries have bumped up against their ability to borrow			1
the problem is that some @entity2 countries are bumping up against their ability to borrow in euros			1
that limit is imposed not by markets , but by the @entity37			1
nobody doubts that the @entity3 can generate dollars to pay its bills			1
nobody doubts that @entity41 can generate yen , or that @entity42 can generate pounds sterling			0
but they do doubt that @entity18 or @entity45 can generate the euros they need , because -- unlike the @entity3 or @entity41 or @entity42 -- @entity18 and @entity45 lack the power to create their own money			1
maybe not @entity51 , which is a special case , but the other troubled countries could recover their borrowing ability tomorrow if they quit the euro and resumed their former national currencies			1
@entity3 need to understand this truth , because otherwise they will be blindsided by the real risks out there			2
the hard - pressed countries of the eurozone have an escape hatch : they can quit the euro currency			1
quitting the euro would not be pain - free -- but it might well become a less painful alternative to what those countries are suffering now : @entity73 levels of unemployment , rising taxes , massive social security cutbacks			1
over the past two years , for example , @entity77 has cut government spending by almost 8 points of gdp			0
to achieve the same scale of cut in the @entity3 , we 'd have to abolish both @entity85 and @entity86			2
the sacrifices countries make to stay inside the eurozone fall mostly on their own people			0
but if they quit , the pain is exported -- and will be heading our way			0
consider for example a working @entity94 , earning , say , 40,000 euros a year and holding a 2,000 euro balance on his credit card			1
the @entity94 's salary is converted from 40,000 euros to 40,000 new pesetas			2
quickly , the new peseta loses value against the euro			0
a month after the conversion date , the @entity94 's 40,000 new pesetas are worth only 20,000 euros			2
he is poorer than he was			0
but at least he 's working			0
at @entity18 's new lower wages , other @entity18 quickly find work too , just as @entity3 rapidly went to work when the @entity3 quit the gold standard in 1934			1
imported goods become more expensive			0
but not rents -- they are denominated in new pesetas too			0
when our @entity94 buys his morning cup of coffee , the beans will be more expensive and the sugar too			0
the wages of the barista who makes the coffee , however , will have declined in tandem with his own			0
ditto the mortgage on the coffee shop			0
and those nontraded inputs account for most of the cost of the cup			0
now look at the other side of the ledger , the @entity94 's debt			2
what happens to that 2,000 balance on his credit card ? it is ( presumably ) also redenominated into new pesetas			2
it also falls in value , to just 1,000 euros			0
good news for the @entity94			0
bad news for the credit card company			2
or is it ? in the 2000s , @entity18 banks emulated @entity3 banks in the aggressive use of securitization			2
as of 2010 , the @entity37 reports , @entity18 banks had issued more asset - backed securities than the banks of any other @entity2 country except the @entity150 -- and vastly more than the banks of @entity152 and @entity21 combined			1
which means that our @entity94 's credit - card debt is probably not owed to the company that issued his credit card			1
that debt is owed to some other financial institution , somewhere else on earth			2
where ? who knows ? even the people who own the debt may not know			0
as we learned during the subprime mortgage crash , bad loans get sliced and diced , recombined and repackaged , into bonds whose contents are not always understood by the pension funds and insurance companies that buy them			0
those bond buyers often only discovered that they had bought bonds based on subprime mortgages after the mortgages failed			0
financial institutions that have bought @entity18 credit - card debt ( or @entity18 mortgages or whatever ) may discover equally shockingly late that their bonds also will not and can not pay off in full			1
think of those potentially redenominated @entity18 bonds as toxic admixtures into bond portfolios all over the planet -- including possibly the bond portfolio that supports your pension or your life insurance claim			0
and then understand why all this talk of " we could be like @entity51 " so radically misses the point			0
we 're in the same boat already with the @entity18 and the @entity45 and , to a much lesser degree , the @entity51 -- and not because of the way the @entity3 government taxes and spends , but because of the way world financial institutions borrow and lend			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 says the @entity2 financial crisis is not about debt , it 's about currency
he says some countries unable to borrow in euros with limits set by @entity37
their escape hatch : quit the euro . *ensuing* credit - card debt could have global effect
@entity220 : @entity3 financial portfolios could suffer because of how world financial institutions work
