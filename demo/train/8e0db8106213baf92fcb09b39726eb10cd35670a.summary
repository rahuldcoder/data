-- most of us assume that our doctors are trustworthy			2
they undergo a minimum of seven years of postgraduate schooling , pass rigorous tests and are responsible for our health and the health of our families			0
but are they as trustworthy as we think ? a @entity12 oncologist was arrested recently for allegedly running a multimillion - dollar scheme to defraud @entity14			1
he 's accused of administering chemotherapy to patients with no real chance of survival and misdiagnosing patients in order to charge for their expensive treatments			2
and earlier this month an @entity23 spine surgeon was indicted on charges that he persuaded patients to undergo millions of dollars worth of treatments that they did n't need			1
among the things he allegedly told patients was that their heads would fall off without his operation			1
while these egregious stories are truly shocking and uncommon , there are unfortunately many less dramatic examples of untrustworthy doctors that do n't make big news			1
my field of cosmetic plastic surgery has its share of doctors who do n't necessarily place their patients ' best interests first			1
i encounter these patients ' subsequent problems nearly every week			2
one middle - aged woman was left with scarred legs resembling a burn patient 's after undergoing unnecessary laser liposuction by a cardiologist			2
another was abandoned by his @entity53 surgeon after undergoing a lunchtime facelift and contracting a staph infection			0
one woman underwent a botched tummy tuck by an emergency room physician , leaving her abdomen a scarred , lumpy mess			0
how surgeons build new breasts so what 's a patient to do ? here are some tips to make sure your physician , and the advice he or she gives you , are trustworthy : research your doctor			1
the easiest way to do this is online			0
there are several doctor - rating websites where patients share their reviews and experiences with physicians			1
you can also check with your state 's @entity81 to determine whether your physician has had his or her license suspended or revoked			0
county courts can also provide information regarding any lawsuits your doctor may have been involved with			2
keep in mind , though , that we live in a litigious society , and even the best doctors get sued , often more than once			2
make sure your doctor is n't practicing outside his / her field			1
this is mainly a problem in plastic surgery , where doctors of all kinds are ditching their chosen specialties to masquerade as cosmetic surgeons			2
if you 're considering plastic surgery , make sure your surgeon is certified by the @entity105 , or better yet , is a member of the @entity107			0
if you 're considering facial plastic surgery , then the @entity108 is considered an equivalent in all states			0
getting back at your ex -- by getting surgery be cautious of doctors who advertise too much			1
the quality of a doctor is often inversely proportional to the size of his or her ad			0
young , new physicians may use ads to introduce themselves to the community , but once word of mouth kicks in , most doctors do n't need to pay for a lot of expensive advertising in order to maintain a busy practice			1
ask a nurse or other hospital support staff			0
hospital workers know who the good and bad doctors are in town			0
ask who they go to for advice or treatment			0
if you 're undergoing treatment with a specialist and are n't comfortable with the doctor 's recommendations , ask your primary care physician what he or she thinks			1
or get a second opinion by another specialist in the same field			0
while stories of unethical physicians are indeed concerning , the majority of doctors are honest , ethical people who place their patients ' best interests first			1
we just do n't hear about it in the media			0
doctors contribute billions of dollars worth of pro bono care every year			0
thousands of doctors staff inner - city and rural clinics to help the disadvantaged at a fraction of what they would earn in an upper - class neighborhood			1
and we do n't often recognize the doctors who get out of bed in the middle of the night to tend to a person injured in a car accident , a woman about to give birth , or an @entity179 patient on the brink of death			1
so should you trust your doctor ? yes			0
after you do your research			0
