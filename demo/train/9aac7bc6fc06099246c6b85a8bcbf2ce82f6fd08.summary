-- as far as hitchhikers go , this one looks harmless enough			2
he or she -- it 's hard to tell -- is short and friendly , if a little fashion - challenged			2
get him talking , however , and he wo n't shut up			2
@entity7 , a talking , tweeting , bucket - bodied @entity9 robot that 's hitchhiking west from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity12 , @entity13 -- a journey of nearly 4,000 miles			1
the robot employs artificial intelligence , speech recognition , social media and other tools to bum rides from motorists			1
deposited last monday on @entity22 outside @entity10 , @entity23 by friday had journeyed to just west of @entity24			1
its travels are being documented on @entity27 , on @entity28 and on the robot 's website , which charts its progress on a map			2
the gender - neutral robot was conceived by university researchers @entity35 and @entity36 , who view its quest as part performance art , part social experiment			2
as they see it , humans in popular science fiction are always wondering whether they can trust robots			2
instead , they 'd like to turn the question around : can robots trust human beings ? so far , the answer appears to be yes			2
three young men gave @entity7 a ride , bought it a stuffed animal and fed it a " meal " of metal screws and motor oil			1
a couple covered @entity57 with a plastic cape to keep it safe from the rain			0
and people have been recharging @entity7 along the way by plugging it into their cars ' cigarette lighters			1
" people seem to be rather intrigued with @entity7 , and take very good care ( of it ) , " said @entity35 , a communications and multimedia professor at @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity36 , a communications professor at @entity68 in @entity24 , in a statement e-mailed to @entity0			1
" we have even seen @entity7 lying in a camping bed under a blanket , and sitting on a toilet , " they said , " so people certainly have fun with it			1
" @entity7 has a bucket for a torso , blue swimming - pool noodles for arms and legs and a smiling led panel for a face , protected by a cake saver			1
it wears yellow gloves on its hands , and wellies -- rubber boots -- on its feet			0
@entity91 is a simple tablet pc and some components from @entity94 , the open - source electronics platform			0
together , all the parts cost about $ 1,000			0
" we wanted to see what we can build on a shoestring budget ... and with tools / components that one can get in any hardware store , " @entity35 and @entity36 said			0
thanks to its computerized innards and speech software , @entity7 can answer basic questions , make small talk and recite info from @entity109			1
it can also get pretty chatty , not always something you want in a road - trip companion			0
" we knew that sometimes ... @entity7 wo n't be able to properly understand what people are saying			1
for these cases , we came up with the solution to let @entity57 simply chatter away , " its creators said			0
" we taught @entity57 to say that sometimes it gets a bit carried away , and that its programmers could only write that many scripts , hoping for people to be patient			0
" @entity7 records its journey via @entity123			1
it contains a camera and snaps random photos every half hour or so , which are moderated before being posted online to protect people 's privacy			0
it also can record conversations with people it meets -- with their permission -- as a sort of audio diary			0
humans who encounter @entity7 are directed to its website , where instructions tell them how to handle the robot ( tip : drop it off at rest stops or gas stations instead of alone on busy highways )			1
@entity7 's final destination is the @entity143 artist center in @entity12 , @entity13 , which means the robot will likely have to hitch a ride on a boat			1
nobody knows exactly how long his cross-country trip will take			0
@entity35 and @entity36 say the goal of their project is to examine the relationship between humans and " smart " technologies while seeing whether an anthropomorphic robot can engender good will , cooperation and even affection			2
the two researchers are worried that someone might mistreat @entity57			0
but the journey 's success so far has allayed their fears a little			0
" we have seen so much support on social media and through other channels that we are now more optimistic , " they said			0
" they ( the robot 's drivers ) all say that wherever they go with @entity7 , they meet lots of people through it			1
" everybody stops , takes pictures , and wants to talk ... so this is an interesting case of technology bringing humans closer to each other			0

a talking robot is hitchhiking west from @entity10 , @entity11 , to @entity12 , @entity13
called @entity7 , it uses artificial intelligence and speech software to communicate
it relies on human drivers to ferry it from place to place
as of friday the robot had reached @entity24
