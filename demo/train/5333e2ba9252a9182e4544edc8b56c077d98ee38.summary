-- " @entity7 , " written by my friend , the brilliant playwright @entity0 , and based on his story during the earliest days of the @entity3 epidemic , tells a tale that many of us lived through , and many others did not survive			1
it 's as relevant today as an @entity14 movie as when it premiered on the stage in @entity16 in 1985			1
back then , the @entity17 refused to print the word " gay , " and @entity16 mayor @entity20 was agonizingly slow to respond to the unfolding epidemic			2
around the country , family members shunned infected relatives , doctors were afraid to touch @entity3 patients , let alone treat them , and hospital wards filled up with young men covered in lesions , dying excruciating deaths			1
i 've almost lost track of the number of funerals i went to in those years			0
my friends were dying all around me -- i 'm lucky that i somehow survived			1
@entity37 , the coalition that @entity0 founded to address the crisis , coined the phrase " silence equals death " as its rallying cry , and it was no exaggeration			0
by the end of 1983 , @entity3 had claimed 2,100 lives , but the government would hardly acknowledge that anything was awry			2
i ca n't help but wonder , if those in power had cared more , if they had done more , perhaps we could have ended this epidemic before it began to circle the globe			0
but they did n't care , they did n't act , and 36 million people have died of @entity3 since			1
worldwide , another than 1.6 million people will die of @entity3 this year			2
in the @entity60 , there will be roughly 50,000 new infections			0
while @entity7 is a product of a specific time , it is not an artifact			2
there is still an @entity3 crisis -- not only in @entity67 , but right here in the @entity60 , in your state , in your community			2
and , just as in 1985 , it is silence , fear and stigma that continue to drive the epidemic			0
today , @entity77 - @entity60 represent 12 % of the national population , but they account for 44 % of @entity60 living with @entity79 , according to the @entity80			0
gay and bisexual men comprise only 2 % of the @entity60 population , but they represented 30 % of the nation 's hiv infections in 2010			2
around 4,000 @entity60 are infected with @entity79 each year because of injection drug use , and one in seven @entity79 - positive @entity60 pass through a correctional facility each year			0
the crisis is particularly acute in the @entity89 , where homophobia is rampant			0
i hope @entity14 's production of " @entity7 " will compel a new generation to act up			1
there is so much work still to be done , but there 's also so much potential			0
the characters in " @entity7 , " living as they did in the 1980s , did n't understand what they or their friends were dying of , and they did n't have treatments to manage the disease			1
they hardly knew how to protect themselves			0
today , we know how to protect everyone , and we have the ability to treat every single person living with @entity79			1
yet @entity3 continues to prey upon the most vulnerable in our society : the poor , the incarcerated , sex workers , drug users , and those living in regions where intolerance and stigma are facts of life			1
today , as ever , silence equals death			0
@entity120 uses photography to fight @entity3 as @entity0 so forcefully taught us nearly 30 years ago -- and as he and @entity122 , the director of the new @entity14 film , continue to remind us today -- we must speak out against injustice , act with compassion , and fight for equality			1
if enough of us raise our voices , we can finally begin to end this epidemic			0
editor 's note : @entity14 , like @entity4 , is owned by @entity131 .			1

@entity120 : in the 1980s , *newspapers* would n't use term " gay , " @entity3 was ignored by many
he says " @entity7 , " an @entity14 film , portrays the days when many of his friends were dying
today 's *challenges* regarding @entity3 are different but equally *urgent* , he says
@entity120 : we can protect and treat everyone , yet the most vulnerable still struggle
