as the shock sinks in of @entity2 's extraordinary announcement of the execution of leader @entity5 's uncle and former protector , government officials and analysts are trying to decipher what the brutal move means			1
the ruthless disposal of @entity12 -- @entity5 's uncle by marriage who had , until recently , been regarded as the second-most powerful figure in the secretive , nuclear - armed nation -- has serious implications for @entity2 , its neighbors and the @entity21 , observers said			1
but exactly what is going on inside the notoriously opaque @entity2 regime remains as murky as ever			0
" we do n't have a clear sense of this at all , " said @entity24 , a senior adviser at the @entity25 who represented the @entity21 in nuclear talks with @entity2			1
some saw the execution , which @entity2 state media reported early friday , as a chilling demonstration of total control by @entity5 , the young leader who came to power two years ago			1
" i think what he 's telling people -- the @entity21 , @entity42 , @entity43 , others -- is that he is his own man , that you are going to have to deal with him , " said @entity37 , executive director of the @entity38 , a nuclear nonproliferation group			0
who is @entity12 ? @entity12 , who was married to @entity5 's aunt , was vice chairman of @entity2 's top military body and had often been pictured beside the young leader , who is believed to be around 30			1
he was considered to be the regent who secured @entity5 's assumption of power after the 2011 death of his father , @entity56			1
but in a lengthy article foaming with outraged rhetoric , @entity2 's official news agency on friday accused @entity12 of trying to overthrow the state , describing him as " despicable human scum			1
" one big question is whether @entity5 acted out of strength , consolidating the power he has amassed over the past two years , or out of fear his uncle was building a rival force inside the regime			0
@entity5 already removed the country 's top general last year , @entity24 noted			1
by taking down @entity12 , he 's axed a powerful figure from the country 's dominant @entity72			2
" it makes you wonder : if he 's consolidating his power , what is he building it around ? " @entity24 said			0
" he 's basically attacking the two most important institutions in @entity2 , which is the party and the military			1
" a @entity21 official said , " executing someone with @entity12 's pedigree would be a dramatic statement that @entity5 intends to be ruthless in consolidating his control			1
" the public airing of the power play under way -- which is highly unusual -- is probably sending shockwaves through @entity2 's leadership cadre			2
" provocative moves few analysts interpreted the execution , which took place days after the @entity95 had said @entity12 had been dramatically removed from his government posts , as a healthy sign			2
" if two weeks ago , we thought that @entity2 was somewhat stable , i think today people feel that it 's not as stable as we thought it was , " said @entity24 , author of " @entity98 : @entity2 , past and @entity101			1
" @entity102 , a lawmaker in @entity42 's governing @entity103 who sits on a parliamentary intelligence committee , said the decision to kill @entity12 suggests @entity5 's power is weaker than that of his father			1
in a statement issued after a phone briefing from @entity42 's @entity111 , @entity102 said the execution appeared to be a pre-emptive effort to prevent any internal unrest over @entity12 's ouster			2
analysts said @entity2 was likely to continue with the provocative moves under @entity5 that have strained its relations with @entity42 , the @entity21 and others			1
" i think there 's going to be a clear amount of brinksmanship , " said @entity37 of the @entity38			0
" i think if we continue to wait for him to do things , he 's going to continue to shoot missiles , and he 'll probably at some point decide to test a nuclear weapon			2
" missile and nukes @entity2 carried out a long - range rocket launch a year ago and an underground nuclear test , its third so far , in february			1
the @entity134 sanctions that followed were met by a barrage of threatening rhetoric from @entity137 , directed at @entity42 and the @entity21 , which ratcheted up tensions in the region			0
the situation has calmed since , and the @entity95 have resumed dialogue			0
the two sides have agreed to meet next week in their joint industrial zone on the @entity145 's side of the border			0
but with the anniversary of @entity56 's death , last year 's rocket launch and now @entity12 's execution , @entity148 is keeping a close eye on @entity137 's actions , officials said			2
the @entity42 defense ministry said friday that no unusual activities by the @entity157 had been detected			0
" december has always been a month in which something happens with @entity2 , " @entity24 said			0
" and we 're only halfway through it			0
" in @entity164 , a @entity163 official acknowledged having seen the report of @entity12 's execution			2
" while we can not independently verify this development , we have no reason to doubt the official @entity172 report , " deputy spokeswoman @entity166 said in a statement , referring to @entity2 's state news agency			1
" if confirmed , this is another example of the extreme brutality of the @entity2 regime			0
we are following developments in @entity2 closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region , " @entity166 added			0
@entity43 , whose senior officials were considered to have close ties to @entity12 , described the recent developments as @entity2 's " internal affairs			1
" @entity187 hopes and believes that relations between the two countries " will continue ( to ) advance healthily and steadily , " @entity185 , a foreign ministry spokesman , said at a regular briefing friday			0
opinion : how @entity5 got rid of his uncle ' worse than a dog ' the official @entity2 report on the execution said a special military tribunal had been held thursday against @entity12 , who was accused of trying to overthrow the state " by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods			1
" it added , " all the crimes committed by the accused were proved in the course of hearing and were admitted by him			0
" once his guilt was established , @entity12 was immediately executed , it said			2
the @entity172 report described @entity12 as a " traitor for all ages " and " worse than a dog , " saying he had betrayed his party and leader			0
@entity12 and his allies were accused of double - dealing behind the scenes , " dreaming different dreams " and selling the country 's resources at cheap prices , thereby threatening @entity2 's economic development , according to a @entity172 statement this week			1
" @entity12 desperately worked to form a faction within the party by creating illusion about him and winning those weak in faith and flatterers to his side , " the statement said			0
it also accused @entity12 of womanizing , drug use , gambling , eating at expensive restaurants and undergoing medical treatment in a foreign country			0
friday 's @entity172 report said @entity12 distributed pornographic pictures among his confidants and took at least 4.6 million euros ( $ 6.3 million ) " from his secret coffers and squandered it in 2009 alone			2
" analysis : @entity2 execution raises more questions than answers			0

@entity2 seems " not as stable as we thought , " one analyst says
