-- an alleged commander for the @entity2 and affiliated @entity3 appeared in a @entity5 court tuesday to face a host of charges -- from supporting terrorism to attempted murder of an @entity5 citizen -- tied to a 2009 attack in @entity12			1
@entity13 was in a federal court in @entity15 , @entity16 , just outside of @entity17 , on tuesday , less than a month after his indictment and on the same day that the charging document against him was released			0
his arraignment is scheduled for friday , according to the @entity22			0
according to the indictment , @entity13 is a @entity24 citizen who once served in that nation 's military as an officer and tank commander			1
he has been a follower of @entity29 , the head of the @entity2 movement in @entity12 , since 2001			1
by 2009 , the document alleges , @entity13 was fighting for the @entity2 and the @entity3 , an organization the @entity5 has designated as a foreign terrorist network			1
he allegedly coordinated an attack on @entity35 , an @entity36 compound in eastern @entity12 's @entity37 , in november of that year			2
directing a large arsenal of weapons -- including machine guns , grenades , a portable rocket , an anti-aircraft gun and a recoilless rifle , the latter two of which were aimed to fire upon @entity5 military aircraft should they arrive on site -- @entity13 led the attack and then personally fired on @entity5 and @entity12 forces with a machine gun , the indictment states			1
the document did not state the result of the attack , but said " a large number of insurgents were killed			0
" the @entity22 stated that the @entity5 military took @entity13 into custody then			2
the @entity24 citizen , now about 55 years old , was turned over to the @entity61 on monday			1
charges he faces include conspiring to provide and providing material support for terrorists , conspiring and attempting to destroy a @entity5 aircraft , as well as conspiring and attempting to kill a @entity5 government employee -- in this case , members of the @entity5 military			1
under federal law , a person does n't have to have committed a crime in the @entity5 for charges to be filed against them in @entity5 courts			2
that 's because laws for things like supporting terrorists or trying to kill @entity5 citizens or employees apply outside of @entity5 soil			0
in fact , many people have been brought back to the @entity5 to be tried for attacks committed overseas			0
still , it 's rare for such charges to come out of the ongoing hostilities in @entity12			0
" this is very unusual , " said @entity88 professor @entity87			0
@entity0 's @entity90 contributed to this report .			0
