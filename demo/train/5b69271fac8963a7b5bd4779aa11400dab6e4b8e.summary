a mob , wielding baseball bats , broken bottles and knives , swarms a @entity5 synagogue			1
violence erupts at a @entity8 rally in @entity9 after a demonstrator reportedly stomps on a @entity12 flag			1
phone calls and text messages threaten a @entity15 who organized a protest in @entity18			1
a trending @entity20 hashtag says @entity21 was right			1
as missiles and rockets fly in the @entity25 , tensions are boiling over around the world between activists at demonstrations on both sides of the @entity31 - @entity12 conflict			1
plenty of protests have been peaceful , but not all of them			1
on monday , the @entity35 warned @entity37 institutions to step up security in light of violence and anti-semitic expressions at what it described as anti-israel rallies across the @entity44 and around the world			1
an @entity35 website tracking recent protests listed events in @entity48 ; @entity49 ; @entity50 ; @entity51 ; and @entity52 , @entity53			1
" the tenor at some of the anti-israel rallies has been extreme , " the @entity35 said , " with protesters chanting ' death to @entity31 ' and other hateful messages and slogans			1
" in @entity62 , where @entity63 has flared up in recent years , some warn that hostilities have entered a different realm			1
" the level of danger is very new , " said @entity66 , who was trapped for hours inside a @entity5 synagogue on sunday			1
" today and tomorrow for the @entity37 people in @entity62 is fully different from what it was yesterday			1
" in the @entity44 , too , @entity73 says she 's sensed something is changing			1
after organizing a @entity77 protest in @entity18 this month , @entity75 said she started getting threatening phone calls , text messages and social media posts accusing her of supporting terrorism			1
it 's the first time she 's felt personally targeted after years of activism			1
" people are getting really fanatical			1
... i 've never seen it get this ugly , " @entity75 said			1
how did this happen ? @entity91 , @entity90 , @entity92 and @entity93 all in flames ' it looked like a war ' a 17 - year - old @entity37 girl reported that she was grabbed by the jaw and pepper - sprayed in the face on a @entity5 street the day @entity31 launched its latest operation in @entity92			1
she told police her attacker called her a " @entity63 , " and said , " @entity105 , you will die , " according to the @entity106 , a @entity62 watchdog organization			1
a local chapter of the @entity108 , a far - right @entity37 group , bragged on social media the next day about fighting with anti-israel demonstrators			1
" we were 30 facing 200 supporters of @entity112			1
and yet all will remember our visit ... especially the 6 wounded on their side , " the group posted on @entity20			1
a @entity62 watchdog organization , meantime , has since reported telephone death threats against @entity37 merchants			1
synagogue - goers in the @entity122 neighborhood of @entity5 were recently greeted by demonstrators who screamed " death to the @entity37 , " and a firebomb was tossed at the entrance of another synagogue in the northeastern suburb of @entity129 , the @entity106 reported			1
and then , on sunday evening , a perfect storm brewed			1
just as a community gathered in @entity5 ' @entity133 to pray for peace , thousands of demonstrators marching in support of @entity12 finished up nearby , @entity66 , the synagogue 's president , said			2
a fraction of those demonstrators broke off with other plans			2
@entity140 , 36 , lives across the street from the synagogue and said she saw -- and heard -- them coming			2
" from my windows , i saw two groups ( around 100 persons ) , from the two sides of the street , converging [ at ] the synagogue , " she wrote in an e-mail to @entity145 late monday			1
they carried baseball bats , she said			2
they threw chairs and tables , taken from nearby cafes , and headed toward the entrance gate			2
and then , she said she heard them scream , " death to the @entity159			1
" from inside , where he 'd gathered with about 400 others , @entity66 said he saw men outside brandishing broken bottles and knives			2
the synagogue president , who @entity145 spoke to monday night , also said he heard cries of " jews to the oven " and " allahu akbar ! " a small band of security guards managed to block entry , @entity66 said			2
@entity159 , some affiliated with the @entity108 , also stepped into the fray -- spewing their own vitriol , @entity174 said			2
the @entity178 , a wire service for global @entity37 news , reported that " at least three @entity159 were taken to the hospital as a result of the clashes			2
" this chaos went on for about 40 minutes , @entity174 said , before police arrived in droves			2
" the scene was very violent , with terrifying and anti-semitic slogans , " said @entity174 , who happens to be involved with @entity187 , a @entity62 anti-racism organization			1
" i was very , very anxious and shocked			2
it looked like a war			2
" trying to ' turn the other cheek ' as she stepped forward to make closing remarks at a @entity196 demonstration she organized over the weekend in @entity18 , @entity75 said she saw the crowd turn the other way			2
across the street , she said , there were two men with @entity31 flags who discharged pepper spray toward the crowd			2
" i kept telling everybody , just keep your backs facing them , do n't give them any attention , " said @entity75 , a @entity15 who helped found the @entity18 - based movement to end @entity31 @entity208			2
but on the fringes of the crowd , she said , @entity77 demonstrators started shouting back			2
" i said , ' stop talking to them			2
this is only fueling a lot of this			0
turn the other cheek , ' " she said			0
" but easier said than done			0
" eventually , things simmered down , but hours after the protest , @entity75 said her phone rang with a surprising message			0
a man on the other end , she said , threatened to report her to the @entity232 , accusing her of aiding terrorism			0
he said he was happy about recent bombings in @entity92 , " that everybody deserves to be killed , and that i should be careful , my name is out there , " @entity75 said			0
@entity75 told him that she did nothing wrong			0
but she said the conversation , which was followed by days of text messages and @entity244 posts in the same vein , rattled her			0
" i 've never seen an opposing side go to that extreme , " she said			0
what if they found where she lived or targeted her family ? " my biggest concern is if we have another demonstration , i do n't want anything like this to happen , " @entity75 said			0
" this is the exact stuff we 're protesting against			0
i do n't want to be connected to people fighting people over anything			1
" but that does n't mean she 'll stop speaking out			0
she sent photos of the weekend protest to her uncle in @entity263 , whose neighborhood was recently destroyed in a bombing			0
she hopes the photos will let him know that the world is watching			0
" it 's just such a sad situation			0
we should have figured out by now that barbaric acts of violence do n't accomplish anything from any side of it , " she said			1
" we live in a modern society			0
we know that this is never a way to create a solution			0
" ' i saw my flag on the ground ' on sunday , a peaceful @entity8 rally in @entity9 turned ugly after demonstrators came face - to - face with counterprotesters in a pickup who were waving @entity12 flags			0
what exactly happened , however , depends on who you ask			0
four people were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon , accused of driving up to the protest in a truck and hitting @entity8 demonstrators with handheld flagpoles , @entity145 affiliate @entity295 reported , citing police			1
this , however , came after a demonstrator reportedly snatched one of the @entity12 flags from the truck and stomped on it			0
" i saw my flag on the ground , " @entity309 , a @entity12 supporter , told @entity145 affiliate @entity310 , " and i saw a man step on it			0
i 'm not here to fight			0
i just need my flag , and i ran to take it			0
" but one witness told the @entity317 the clashes were deliberately provoked by the men in the truck with @entity12 flags			0
" they were looking for a fight , " @entity322 told the newspaper			0
they were " taunting and threatening " people , thrusting their sticks toward demonstrators on the sidewalk			1
a video purportedly recorded by a student at the protest and published on the website of the @entity334 shows insults flying in both directions			0
the @entity337 called for an ambulance to treat a woman allegedly hurt by the men , who were later picked up and booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon			0
they 've since been released on bail , deny the charges and say they were " falsely arrested , " the @entity317 reported			0
and as if this ruckus was n't already heated enough , as the pickup drove off , an officer with @entity337 -- who was trying to stop the men from leaving -- fired his weapon			0
that officer has been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated , officials said			0
from clicks to clashes as the rocket attacks from @entity92 and @entity31 airstrikes show no signs of slowing , hostilities are flaring online as much as they are in the streets			0
over the weekend , # @entity363 trended on @entity20 , part of what the @entity35 described as an " online outpouring of @entity63			0
" the group said wednesday that a surge in @entity21 - related hashtags might be fueling hatred at rallies as well			1
anti-arab statements have also run rampant online			0
a now - discontinued @entity244 page called " @entity376 , " racked up thousands of likes earlier this month , the @entity374 reported			0
on the page , according to the newspaper , users posted photos with captions like " death to the whole @entity384 nation " and " hating @entity384 is not racism ; it 's morality			1

while missiles fly in @entity25 , tensions soar outside the region
hatred , even violence , erupts at demonstrations in @entity62 and @entity44
people on both sides of the issue talk of death threats
the battle is also being waged in venomous words on social media
