-- @entity2 ' latest venture in the tourist business has proved a resounding , if unlikely , success			2
a timely piece of good news too for the @entity9 travel agent from @entity10 , an industrial town on the outskirts of @entity13 , who has been keen to keep turnover strong in these austere times			1
it was always a bold business model : his company , @entity20 , specializes in holidays that normal people would n't dream of paying for , flying to destinations where even an innocent tourist could be suspected as a foreign agent			1
@entity26 used to be a popular resort for his customers			1
but revenues fell when all their pre-booked tours to @entity33 in july were cancelled following the government 's ban on visitors to the area			1
caddies : the good , the bad and the outspoken the most captivating experience on offer though was the tour to @entity42			1
@entity2 hatched a plan to get more people interested in traveling to the last @entity46 enclave on earth : by setting up @entity42 's very first international amateur golf championship			1
" someone contacted me saying they were interested in playing the golf course of @entity42			1
i said there was absolutely no possibility what so ever of that happening , " @entity2 told @entity0			2
the @entity42 crisis and the $ 74m course that nobody plays " but i asked them [ the @entity42 authorities ] anyway and they were interested			1
" @entity42 's golfing pedigree begins and ends with the oft - repeated legend that in 1994 that the @entity42 's leader @entity62 hit a world record 38 , with five holes in one , at the @entity65			1
aside from being entirely false -- the course record is 73 shot by a local @entity42 golfer -- the game runs deeper than many would think with several courses to be found in the north			1
along with the 18 - hole @entity65 , and a nine hole course next to a hotel in the city , a $ 73 million championship course was built near the @entity77 during calmer times			1
it was hoped that tourism could help bring valuable foreign currency north , whilst helping to mend relationships with the south			2
a pro-event was even held			2
as the political tensions heated up the course was abandoned , its empty fairways a metaphor for relations between the two countries			0
but @entity2 decided to go ahead with the inaugural 2011 @entity91 anyway			0
" it is in the middle of the military range , so you get soldiers patrolling the fairways , " he explained			0
" it 's 40 miles outside @entity65			1
the grass was a little bit longer than we were used to			0
it was inside a valley , with mountains all around			0
i do n't think many people use it			0
it has 80 members , mainly diplomatic staff			0
" a ramshackle field of 17 @entity9 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 golfers took part			0
more than 30 had applied , @entity2 explained , but several were dropped after it was discovered they were journalists			0
@entity42 puts heavy restrictions on journalists entering the country			1
reporters without @entity124 's annual @entity123 ranked @entity42 177 out of 178 counties , making it one of most repressive countries in the world to be a journalist			1
" originally i was trying to play golf in @entity134 , @entity26 and @entity42 , " explained 35 - year - old @entity130 - based computer programmer @entity129 , one of the 17 golfers who made the trip			1
" i had an idea to play golf in these three countries for an adventure			1
anywhere that has a poor reputation in the @entity113 and see what golf was like over there			2
the list of unlikely places to play golf is diminishing			2
as the world opens up the list gets smaller and smaller every year			0
" yet @entity42 remains resolutely closed , making its first home - grown golf tournament all the more surprising			1
when @entity129 read about the tournament -- open to anyone that has an official handicap -- he thought it was a joke			0
but two months later he was getting on a train at the @entity158 border headed for @entity65 , terrified			0
" i was so nervous about going in , " he recalled			0
" i left instructions with my family that if i did n't contact them within a day they should start looking for me			0
" but after arriving in the capital , seeing the wide , car-less boulevards , empty cities and " fields full of crops , being worked by hand , " he felt safe enough to stay			0
" the course was n't in fantastic condition , not terrible			0
it was like a municipal course in a southern town to look at it			0
because the @entity42 are loath to get any foreign input they have done greens how they think they should do it			1
the out of bounds were everywhere			0
" so severe were the out of bounds -- a bi-product of being built next to a military firing range -- that many found it difficult to stay on the course from one hole to the next			0
" we had a team of female @entity42 caddies who would applaud every shot , " said @entity129			1
" i did n't play well			0
i was nervous on the first tee			0
with the female caddies there were 40 people there			1
tv cameras , including a @entity42 tv crew , were watching it			1
i hit my first tee shot out of bounds			2
" alas , @entity129 did n't claim the the @entity207 's first ever winner 's trophy			2
that honor was reserved for the @entity210 golfer @entity209 , clinching the course record after shooting a respectable 72			2
now @entity2 believes that the tournament can help raise the profile of the sport in the country			0
" there was one @entity42 who played in it , the rest were watching it			1
it 's too expensive for most people			2
but loads of people said they were going to take up the sport after watching it , " he said hopefully			0
recently the @entity42 government approved the 2012 @entity91 , meaning that @entity2 will be back next may with another batch of scratch golfers and curious hackers looking to play on one of the most hard to reach courses on the planet			1
the plan is to , one day , move to the empty $ 73 million championship course on the 38th parallel , but that might have to wait a while			2
" we 'd like to play it there but there 's no chance at the moment because of the political situation , " he admitted			2
" they [ the @entity42 ] have seized some property off the @entity246 but i hope so			1
one day we will play it			0
