@entity0 may be dead , but his execution thursday in the @entity3 state of @entity4 has made him the poster boy for the global movement to end the death penalty			1
world figures , including pope @entity9 and former @entity3 president @entity10 , human rights groups and commentators urged the execution to be halted -- but to no avail			1
on wednesday @entity0 was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of off - duty police officer @entity18 despite doubts being raised over the conviction			1
the execution sparked angry reactions and protests in @entity25 capitals -- as well as outrage on social media			1
" we strongly deplore that the numerous appeals for clemency were not heeded , " the @entity29 foreign ministry said			1
" there are still serious doubts about his guilt , " said @entity33 's junior minister for human rights @entity34			1
" an execution is irreversible -- a judicial error can never be repaired			2
" the @entity42 expressed " deep regret " over the execution and repeated its call for a universal moratorium on capital punishment			1
@entity42 foreign policy chief @entity50 said the bloc had learnt " with deep regret that mr @entity0 was executed , " her spokeswoman @entity48 told @entity53			1
' " the @entity42 opposes the use of capital punishment in all circumstances and calls for a universal moratorium , " she said			1
" the abolition of that penalty is essential to protect human dignity			0
" @entity61 condemned the execution in a statement			0
" the @entity3 justice system was shaken to its core as @entity4 executed a person who may well be innocent			2
killing a man under this enormous cloud of doubt is horrific and amounts to a catastrophic failure of the justice system , " @entity61 said			0
in @entity78 's @entity77 newspaper , @entity71 , reporting from @entity73 , @entity4 , before the execution took place , gave 10 reasons why he believed the death sentence for " a man who is very possibly innocent " should be commuted			0
most of his argument concerned doubts about the conviction -- seven of the nine key witnesses to the murder of @entity18 later recanted their evidence -- but his final reason concerned the manner in which @entity0 was put to death			2
" even if you set aside the issue of @entity0 's innocence or guilt , the manner of his execution tonight is cruel and unnatural , " @entity73 wrote			1
" if the execution goes ahead as expected , it would be the fourth scheduled execution date for this prisoner			0
in 2008 he was given a stay just 90 minutes before he was set to die			0
experts in death row say such multiple experiences with imminent death is tantamount to torture			0
" in the right - of - center @entity110 , @entity109 said the death penalty was " barbaric " and far more likely to be used against black people than white			0
but the main thrust of his argument was that there were serious doubts over the conviction			0
" if you are pro-death penalty , you should be shouting twice as loud as the rest of us about the imminent murder of @entity0 , " @entity109 wrote			2
" otherwise , you ca n't claim to be supporting a stark but necessary act of justice			0
you 're just a fan of killing people in general			0
there are words for people like that			0
none of them are nice			0
" on social media , many users predicted the execution would encourage a new civil rights movement to spring up			1
@entity3 novelist @entity137 commented that on the issue of capital punishment the @entity3 was isolated from much of the rest of the world " so i wake up to hear they executed @entity0			1
wonder if most @entity3 realize how far out of step they are with international norms			2
" and entertainer @entity146 remarked that campaigners should continue their campaign despite @entity0 's death			2
" it 's one thing to fight for @entity0 when he was alive but the key question now is will you still fight for his cause after his death ? "			2
