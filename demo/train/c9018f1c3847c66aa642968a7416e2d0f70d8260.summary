@entity0 -- @entity4 harvested organs from bodies in the 1990s without permission of family members , the former head of a state - run forensic laboratory said in a newly released interview			1
government officials acknowledge that the practice happened , but emphasize that it ended years ago			1
in an interview in 2000 , which was released to an @entity4 tv channel and broadcast over the weekend , dr. @entity13 -- who was once head of the @entity14 -- discussed the practice			1
" we started to harvest corneas for various hospitals in @entity4 , " @entity13 said in the interview on @entity4 's @entity19 network			1
" whatever was done was highly informal			0
no permission was asked from the families , " he said			0
@entity13 said the harvesting also included heart valves , skin and bones			1
he was speaking to an @entity32 researcher , who recently gave the tape to the @entity4 network			2
an @entity4 @entity38 spokeswoman , @entity36 - @entity35 , issued a statement saying the practice discussed in the report was " an old story that ended years ago " and that in the vast majority of cases , the actions were done to @entity4 , including soldiers			1
procedures were not clear at the time and have since been clarified , she said			0
none of the practices led to charges , she said			0
the report said organs were at times also harvested from @entity54 and foreign workers			1
in the interview , @entity13 was asked about the legality of such practices			0
" it was n't clear , " he said , adding that he thought families were supposed to be asked for permission			0
after getting permission from family members to perform an autopsy , " we felt free " to harvest organs , he said			0
organs were not harvested if it was believed relatives might discover it , he said , adding that in some cases glue was used to close eyelids to hide missing corneas			1
the report included a statement from the military , the @entity76 , saying the activity ceased a decade ago			0
the report also described how for years the @entity14 , " supplied not just tragic passing announcements but also news about organs donated for transplants which saved the lives of hundreds of patients			2
" the report comes four months after a different allegation about organ harvesting in @entity4			1
an opinion piece published in a @entity90 newspaper in august suggested the @entity4 army kidnapped and killed young @entity54 to harvest their organs in the 1990s			1
the writer , @entity93 , told @entity1 he had no proof that @entity4 soldiers were stealing organs , and that the purpose of his piece was to call for an investigation			1
the article triggered a dispute between @entity90 and @entity4			1
while the @entity104 distanced itself from the report , the country 's foreign ministry refused to condemn it , saying @entity90 has a free press			2
@entity4 finance minister @entity107 called it " an anti-semitic blood libel against the @entity111 people and the jewish state			2
" it was after hearing about that uproar that @entity32 anthropologist @entity114 , a professor at the @entity115 , decided to release the tape of the interview she conducted with @entity13 in 2000 , @entity4 's @entity19 reported			2
@entity114 told the network that she does not believe @entity4 murdered @entity54 for organs			1
but the admission of harvesting organs , including skin , at times from @entity54 , struck her , she said			1
" the symbolism of taking skin out of a population that is considered to be the enemy and using it for skin for the military , that 's something that -- just in terms of symbolic weight -- has to be reconsidered , " she told @entity19			0
the forensic institute at @entity135 , where @entity13 still works , received complaints about improper practices regarding organ harvesting that culminated in an investigation and a change of management			0
the current manager , @entity143 , issued a statement saying , " the committee which examined the said matters have determined that there were purely managerial malfunctions , but as a result of their findings professor @entity13 lost his position as the manager of the institute			0
" managerial responsibility was changed and new procedures were put in place , the statement said			0
hiss could not be reached for comment			0
