@entity2 , @entity3 @entity1 gov. @entity0 portrayed himself as a battle tested warrior who has successfully beat back successive attempts by powerful @entity9 - aligned organizations to try and defeat him , during a campaign style speech thursday night to members of the @entity12			1
@entity0 , who is considering a run for the @entity12 presidential nomination , used his remarks to sharply criticize @entity16 and @entity17 as he argued that @entity18 should look to the states for a presidential nominee in 2016			1
while not outwardly saying he would run , it was clear @entity0 was making the point to these state party leaders and activists that he has the record and the experience to be the next @entity18 nominee			1
" i want to share a vision , i think we have a unique opportunity going forward , not only for the good of this party , but more importantly for the good of the country , to find a new fresh leader out there who can take big bold ideas , take ideas that come from of outside of @entity16 , from the states all the way down to the grassroots , " @entity0 said			1
" we need someone who hopefully has the backing and the track - record of success , of showing that commonsense , commonsense conservative reforms can work not just in @entity1 , but they can work all across @entity49			0
" @entity0 reiterated a common theme throughout his remarks that it is a time for a " fresh new approach " -- an apparent reference to @entity53 and @entity54 , both of whom have strongly signaled they will seek the @entity12 nomination			1
as he was leaving the ballroom following his speech , @entity0 was asked about @entity53 , to which he replied " good man " as he walked away			1
in his speech , he noted it was critical for the @entity18 to offer voters a contrasting vision and experience in governing in the next election			0
" for us going forward , if we are going to be up against particularly , @entity17 , we got to offer a new fresh approach , and ideally it comes from the states , " he said			0
" the reason for that , the reason we mentioned last week in our inaugural address is the states is the place where he actually gets things done			0
" @entity0 was a top target for national democrats last year , but he won re-election by more than five points			2
he survived a recall election in 2012			0
@entity0 also emphasized that he enjoyed campaigning and meeting voters -- an important trait for a presidential candidate who endures grueling hours on the road away from family and friends			2
he told the audience that the reason he was motivated to run for governor in 2009 was because of his sons			0
" we were afraid that the state was not as great as the @entity1 we grew up in , " @entity0 said of the decision he made with his wife to seek the governorship			2
@entity0 then followed by saying that since taking office , " because of our reforms in our great state of @entity1 , they are growing up in a state that is better , even better than the state i grew up in			2
" he later added , " i look at our country i am worried about our country the same way i was worried about my state in 2009			0
