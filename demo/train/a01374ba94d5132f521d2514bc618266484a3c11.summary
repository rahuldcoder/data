as a proud @entity2 mother , @entity0 can not bear to see " @entity4 , " even though it now rates as the biggest grossing war movie of all time			1
her son , @entity9 , told her that his life mirrored the movie			1
" i ca n't bring myself to watch it , " @entity12 said			2
@entity9 was only 20 when he was assigned to the sniper section of a mortar platoon at the height of the @entity18 war			1
when i met him there in early 2008 , he told me he was well - suited for his mission			1
he grew up hunting in @entity23 and was used to waiting for his prey			2
not every soldier has that kind of patience			2
not every soldier can become a sniper			1
@entity9 already had his first confirmed kill when we met			1
he was hungry for another one			2
and he got more , though he would n't tell me how many when i caught up with him this week after i saw the movie			1
" i really do n't want to talk about that , " he said			2
but what he did say was that just like @entity4 , the central character of " @entity4 , " he felt he was doing the right thing			1
" i enjoyed being on a roof , knowing that any moment now , this could be it			2
i enjoyed the thrill of getting a shot out			2
i liked killing the enemy			1
" the @entity45 - nominated blockbuster biopic , which tells the story of the most lethal sniper in @entity49 history , has fueled intense debate over the film 's message			1
is it anti-war or not ? is @entity4 a hero or a psychopath ? those questions -- and interest in the movie -- may only intensify as the soldier accused of killing @entity4 and his friend @entity60 goes to trial in the coming days			1
jury selection in the case of former @entity65 @entity64 was scheduled to begin thursday in @entity66 , @entity67			2
it 's expected that mental health will be key -- @entity4 and @entity60 were helping @entity64 with rehabilitation at a rifle range when @entity64 gunned them down two years ago			1
i 've met sharpshooters who relished the moment of a kill			2
some liked the adrenaline and the satisfaction of vanquishing a foe			2
others were drawn to the stark simplicity of a life - and - death moment -- when nothing else seemed important			1
no matter the perspective , i 've heard a couple of constant themes from soldiers			2
" @entity4 , " they say , is a must - see for anyone who wants to understand the @entity49 experience in @entity18			1
still , for those who fought in uniform , especially sharpshooters , it can be difficult to watch			2
@entity9 mentioned a scene toward the end of the movie in which @entity4 , played by @entity99 , adjusts his scope and targets an @entity18 sniper as a dust storm clouds the air			1
this is supposed to be @entity4 's legendary longest shot at 2,100 yards away			1
the first time @entity9 killed , he did the same from a rooftop in restive @entity109 , southeast of @entity110			1
he scoured the area with high - powered opticals known as the @entity113			1
there was no dust storm , but it was early in the morning and hard to focus through dense fog			2
@entity9 spotted a man trying to hide from helicopters overhead			1
he saw him pick up an object , put it over his shoulder and attempt to cover it with a blanket			2
@entity9 thought it might be a shaped - charge explosive that can pierce armored vehicles			1
" i remember it to this day , like i was still sitting there , " he said			0
he heard the command , " engage , " and opened fire with his .50 - caliber rifle -- two rounds through the trees , two more on either side			1
his shot was 1,243 yards			0
he anticipated he would be upset by his first kill			0
" i was n't nervous or anything			0
i did n't feel nothing , " he later told @entity138 , the battalion chaplain who counseled @entity9 in @entity18 and who i followed for many weeks for a series about a man of @entity143 in a place of war			1
even then , i heard @entity9 speak lines that @entity4 echoes in " @entity4 " : their kills saved @entity49 lives , and that 's what mattered			1
only 2 % of men are not loath to kill , wrote @entity153 in his landmark book " on killing : the @entity156 to kill in @entity157			1
" chaplain @entity138 thought @entity9 might be one of them , though he worried how it would affect the young soldier later on			1
@entity9 still believes he , like @entity4 , is one of the 2 %			1
" when you are bred to kill , you know			0
you just know , " he said			0
@entity9 is a civilian now ; he repairs substations for an electrical company			1
he is 6 years older and has a wife and two little children			0
but he sounds far less sure of himself than when i first saw him wearing a sweat - drenched patrol cap and nursing the @entity171 stuffed in his jaw			2
he returned home from @entity18 and rode his motorbike at crazy speeds on the highway			1
he took a fancy to bull riding			0
he did another tour in 2009 and admits that he has become an angry person			0
" i go from zero to 90 real quick , " he told me			0
he tried to beat up his dog once , just like @entity4 does in the movie			1
on his first tour , he was troubled by the howls of a woman and her two daughters after @entity9 's team killed her husband			1
he thought then about how his own mother and two brothers would react to his death			0
the opening scene of the movie , when @entity4 takes aim at a woman and child , took @entity9 back to that day			1
he told me that when he closes his eyes every night , he sees faces , hears screams			0
" everyone thinks i 'm crazy , " he said			0
" i 'm just trying to fit in			0
" i asked him the same question his counselor did : " do you have any regrets ? " " that 's not me , " @entity9 replied			1
that 's not @entity209 or any of the other snipers i have spoken with either			0
@entity209 , who now works as an @entity2 recruiter , enjoyed watching " @entity4 " and said that for some reason , he " welcomed the memories			1
" he said he never struggled with what he saw and did at war , but the film 's homefront scenes resonated			2
@entity209 also was only 20 when he did his first tour of @entity18			1
he returned to @entity49 to no one , as he put it			0
he completed sniper training at elite institutions and twice competed in the @entity223			2
he was a sniper team leader in @entity224			2
" being a sniper is in fact different than just being infantry , " @entity209 told me			2
" it 's an added stressor as everyone expects more from you			0
or that every sniper should be able to perform at @entity234 level because they saw @entity236 in ' shooter			2
' " and now , @entity99 in " @entity4			1
" for snipers , it 's always about watching and waiting on a target			0
and watching and waiting some more			0
but after a while , @entity209 said , it felt like any other job			0
it was the months after his second tour that became a problem for @entity209			0
on that return , he had a wife and child waiting for him at home			0
there are scenes in " @entity4 " that played out at @entity209 's home , lines that were spoken verbatim			1
about @entity209 's absence , his distance , changes in his demeanor			0
" what 's hard to grasp is that nothing is the same			0
... you , your spouse , kids , house , bills , schools , job , interaction skills , emotions are all tainted and jumbled up in what 's left of your brain , " @entity209 said			0
at one point in the movie , @entity4 is back home sitting in front of a television set staring at what sounds like a battlefield			1
" why is he watching that stuff ? " @entity209 's wife asked him as they viewed the movie together			2
" he 's not , " he told his wife			0
and , sure enough , @entity209 had called the scene correctly -- before the camera turns to show a blank tv screen and the audience realizes that the noises are inside @entity4 's head			1
@entity209 , now 30 , has had those moments			0
" i zoned out thinking of a terrible mission i was on			0
it took eight months of nightmares , marriage counseling and a close call on divorce , but he managed to snap out of his post-war haze			0
" i 'm glad i have my husband back , " his wife told him			0
" when she said it , i kind of looked at her funny			0
i did n't feel any different			0
i did n't claim @entity299 , " @entity209 said			0
" but if you ask my wife , i was a train wreck for eight months			0
" @entity209 said he did n't know how many kills he had			0
@entity4 , he said , was a brilliant marksman , but he also happened to be in all of the hot spots in @entity18			1
he faced @entity306 insurgents in @entity307 and @entity309 militants in @entity310			0
the places where @entity4 went , said @entity209 , every @entity18 was the enemy			1
" critics are twisting it and saying that we thought of them all as savages , " he said			0
in @entity4 's autobiography , on which the movie is based , he wrote that he loved being a @entity318			1
" i only wish i had killed more , " he wrote			0
" i loved what i did			0
if circumstances were different -- if my family did n't need me -- i 'd be back in a heartbeat			0
" i 've heard that before from soldiers i met in @entity18			1
i heard it again this week from @entity9			1
he said " @entity4 " made him miss the battlefield even more			1
" i was proud of what i did there , " he said			2
" now that i am out , i feel like a nobody			0
" his mother understands her son is having a difficult time			0
she just wants back the mama 's boy who made her laugh			0
" i love him with everything i have , " she said			0
" i miss my son			0
" she thought she knew the boy she raised until the day he became a sniper .			2

@entity9 believes he is well - suited to be a sniper
@entity343 , like @entity4 in the movie " @entity4 , " has no regrets about killing the enemy
he was proud of what he did in @entity18 and has struggled with adjusting to a more *mundane* existence
