-- a group of tech - savvy entrepreneurs are setting out to rock @entity4 's vibrant music scene by cashing in on the country 's booming mobile phone market			1
founded by three university friends , @entity7 is an ambitious startup aiming to be the major online distribution channel for @entity4 music			1
the new digital service is focused on providing an easy and affordable way for music fans to access their favorite songs , which are often hard to find in one place			1
" we have no single source of aggregated @entity4 music of @entity23 origin , " says @entity16 , chief executive and co-founder of @entity18			1
" so @entity23 is missing on the world map in terms of musical content -- so the potential is huge			0
" read this : ' @entity30 ' startup takes on @entity31 @entity18 is designed to work similarly to other digital music stores , such as @entity33			2
but its payment options are largely catered to deal with the characteristics of the @entity4 market , which is mainly a cash only society			2
mobile phone users can select the song they want to download and pay instantly for it using their credit			1
songs cost 50 naira , or about 31 @entity44 cents			2
" when users click the pay by mobile button , the download is automatically initiated on their mobile phones and the fee is deducted from their mobile credit , " explains co-founder @entity45 , who is also the startup 's chief operating officer			1
mobile boom @entity4 , @entity23 's second biggest economy , is one of the biggest and fastest growing mobile markets in the continent , with more than 100 million active subscribers			1
it 's this market that the young entrepreneurs behind @entity18 hope to tap , filling a musical void for the country 's cell phone users			2
read this : @entity23 's mobile tech startups " @entity69 holds the biggest potential for us , " says @entity45 , adding that more than 40 million phones in @entity4 are connected to the web			1
" the majority of these users have their mobile phones as their only connection to the internet and any form of technology			0
" computer users can also download songs via the pay by mobile method -- entering their phone number on @entity18 's website -- on top of the standard credit card and @entity88 payment methods			1
from door to door the startup 's three founders , who 've all studied computer science , say they have so far invested $ 45,000 of their own money into the business			0
they recently launched a test version of the platform at one of @entity99 's biggest tech conferences -- the web summit in @entity101 , @entity102			0
the @entity104 - based team is now planning a full scale release of the service in february 2014 , targeting an initial offering of 5,000 songs			1
" the goal now is to have a wide variety , " says @entity45			0
" so from the up - and - coming artists to music of like 20 years ago or 30 years ago , " he adds			2

" what happens with most of these international sites is that they have a structured system where they can just go meet a record label and automatically get about maybe 100,000 songs , or as much as possible -- but in @entity4 , the structure is still growing , " says @entity45			1
fellow co-founder @entity129 explains that because most musicians in the country have their own record labels , the team has to approach each artist separately			0
" having to run after record labels one by one is a very big pain but i think it 's a pain that we 're happy to bear for now , " he says			0
turning problems into opportunities yet , going from door to door is not the only challenge faced by the developers of @entity18			0
finding outside funding in @entity4 has been difficult for the company , so the team is currently exploring international sources of investment to fund their marketing plan			1
similarly , poor infrastructure and connectivity issues have both added to the challenge but failed to stop the entrepreneurs ' efforts			2
" every problem is a potential opportunity , " says @entity129			0
for example , he notes , @entity4 's bandwidth issues have prompted them to build " very lean sites " that offer users a trouble - free experience			1
" within two clicks you can download a song , so we 're trying to overcome that challenge , " he says			0
looking ahead , the team has high hopes for the company 's success and growth			0
" we 're looking to having a pan-african approach to this as time goes by because what we 're actually solving is an @entity23 problem , " says @entity129			0
" a lot of @entity23 do not have access to formal banking methods -- we do n't have a lot of credit cards in @entity23 so we 're looking to deploy it across @entity23			2
" " it 's a big vision for us and we 're going to push it through , " adds @entity45 .			0
