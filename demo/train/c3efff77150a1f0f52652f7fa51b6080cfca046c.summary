-- @entity3 's @entity2 restaurant nahm is now officially @entity5 's best restaurant , but the understated @entity7 - born chef says he 's cross			1
" i 've lost money			2
i bet against myself , " says @entity3			2
" i had several bets and it 's ranged from two bottles of sauce of @entity13 , a bottle of fish sauce , to quite a few hundred dollars			2
damn , " he says			0
with dishes ranging from smoked fish , peanut and tapioca dumplings , to salted threadfin perch with ginger , chili and green mango on betel leaves , nahm 's fiery menu is hailed as a shining example of fine @entity29 cuisine			1
moving up from third place at last year 's inaugural @entity31 & @entity5 's @entity32 , @entity3 says he hopes the honor awarded at last night 's glittering ceremony at @entity35 on @entity37 's @entity36 , will provide a positive boost during what has been a troubled few months in @entity40			1
" @entity2 , as you know , is going through a little bit of a fractious time , " he says			1
" hopefully this will help to sustain us , but also show that @entity29 culture still continues on despite the political disturbances that are occurring at the moment			0
" celebrating excellent food and the top chefs of the region , the list of @entity5 's @entity32 is an off - shoot of the prestigious @entity55 's @entity54 , one of the highest accolades in the industry			1
" that might sound obvious because we 're in @entity5 , but there 's been a lot of @entity67 influence especially at the fine dining end of the market , a lot of @entity72 influence , " says @entity59 , awards organizer and editor of the @entity62 's @entity61			1
" but i think that perhaps is waning and @entity74 cuisine is forging a stronger identity in international terms			0
" back to our roots @entity59 says the best chefs are embracing their unique histories and using them as a basis for creating contemporary , innovative dishes			0
one example is the recipient of the @entity84 which went to @entity85 , executive chef and co-owner of @entity87 , in @entity90 's @entity89 district			2
following in the footsteps of his great grandfather who oversaw the imperial kitchen in the @entity95 during the @entity96 , @entity85 delicately reproduces the recipes passed down through his family for four generations over an oven fire			0
" @entity74 food is very unique , " says @entity85			0
" but we have also lost a lot of the traditions of the food culture			0
now we 're trying to rediscover and recreate some of the traditions			0
" more than 900 global food experts including chefs , restaurateurs , food writers , food critics and other well traveled gourmands have judged the awards , each choosing their top seven restaurants			2
" we do n't give them any criteria			0
it 's entirely up to them , " says @entity59			2
" so one judge might be looking for the perfect plate of food , another judge might be more influenced by the atmosphere and the vibe and the whole experience			0
" we do n't say it has to be about anything except the overall enjoyment of the restaurant , " he says			2
