the @entity1 economy has shaken off the @entity3 crisis with growth figures that outshine its @entity6 peers			1
it is expected to grow 3.1 % this year , according to a forecast by the prestigious @entity9 , above earlier expectations of 2.9 %			1
the growth is well above that expected of @entity13 , @entity3 's biggest economy and one which dragged the bloc out of crisis , at 1.8 %			1
" we have moved from the recovery phase to expansion			0
and furthermore , it 's looking very durable , " said @entity21 , professor of @entity22 at @entity23 and chief economic adviser to the @entity9			0
figures released friday show the @entity1 economy passing the pre-crisis peak from 2008 , with second quarter of growth of 0.8 %			1
@entity21 said the growth is no longer financed by people tapping into their savings -- as was the case this time last year -- but by business expansion and a stronger labor market			0
business spending is on the rise , meaning companies are investing into production rather than sitting on cash			0
business investment by itself now generates more than half of the @entity1 's growth			2
the government is trumpeting a record - high employment -- 73.1 % of people were in work in the three months to may , matching up the previous record - high from 2004/2005			1
but there is a catch			0
while record numbers of @entity57 are working , their wages are growing at the slowest rate on record -- and at about half of the inflation rate			1
that fuels another problem of the @entity1 's economy -- the chronic and rising inequality			1
of all @entity1 households , only the highest earning 20 % increased their disposable income last year			1
the remaining 80 % of households suffered a drop in their income , numbers released by the @entity70 show			0
the @entity74 has also warned that the @entity1 productivity has been " extremely and uncharacteristically weak " since the recession			2
productivity growth , which indicates if the economy can produce more for less , remains below the pre-crisis levels , at 16 %			2
many economists are also warning the @entity1 about a potential housing bubble			1
the average cost of a home in the @entity1 is now 20 % above the pre-crisis peak in 2007			2
the @entity85 has already warned the @entity1 government that rising house prices and low productivity could hinder the economic growth and urged the country to put in place " early measures " to prevent housing bubble			1
but @entity21 told @entity94 the fears of a bubble were overblown			0
" this is not driven by mortgage borrowing			0
in @entity102 for example , it 's mainly cash buying and overseas buyers , " he said , pointing to relatively flat mortgage borrowing			0
the @entity1 is also vulnerable to shocks from outside			2
half of the country 's international trade is with the @entity110 countries , many of which are still suffering from the consequences of the eurozone crisis			0
" if @entity13 takes a hit , we 'll suffer too			0
if @entity13 does well , we 'll do well , like the rest of @entity3 , " @entity21 said			0
