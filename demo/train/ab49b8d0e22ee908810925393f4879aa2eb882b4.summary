at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list at the @entity5 medical center in @entity6 , raising the question of just how many may have been " forgotten or lost " in the system , according to a preliminary report made public wednesday			1
describing a " systemic " practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the @entity13 , the @entity15 's @entity14 called for a nationwide review to determine whether veterans at other locations were falling through the cracks			1
it also appears to indicate the scope of the inquiry is rapidly widening , with 42 @entity15 medical centers across the country now under investigation for possible abuse of scheduling practices , according to the report			1
among the findings at the @entity15 , investigators determined one consequence of manipulating appointments for the veterans was understating patient wait times -- a factor considered for @entity15 employee bonuses and raises , the report said			1
the preliminary report sparked outrage from all corners , with @entity5 secretary @entity40 calling the findings " reprehensible " and ordering the 1,700 veterans be immediately " triaged " for care , while some lawmakers called for the agency 's chief to resign			1
@entity40 has been on " probation " since president @entity52 vowed last week to hold accountable those responsible for the delays , and he remains on " thin ice " with the president pending the outcome of the internal investigations , a @entity50 official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told @entity59			1

the controversy , as @entity59 first reported , involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases			0
@entity59 has reported that in @entity6 , the @entity15 used fraudulent record - keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans , some of whom died in the process			2
' numerous allegations ' the big questions remain under investigation , according to the report : did the facility 's electronic wait list omit the names of veterans waiting for care and , if so , at who 's direction ? and were the deaths of any of these veterans related to delays in care ? " to date our work has substantiated serious conditions at the @entity6 facility , " said the report , which also found another 1,400 veterans were on the @entity15 's formal electronic wait list but did not have a doctor 's appointment			1
the report also found " numerous allegations " of " daily of mismanagement , inappropriate hiring decisions , sexual harassment , and bullying behavior by mid- and senior - level managers			0
" calling the report 's initial findings " damning , " @entity108 chairman @entity107 , @entity109 , said " you can only imagine " what might come out once a fuller investigation is completed			0
the investigation is expected to be completed later this summer , with a final report issued by the @entity15 inspector general in august			2
the report 's findings prompted the @entity120 to call for a criminal investigation			1
" we want every @entity15 employee who participated in these cover - ups to be investigated and prosecuted to the full extent of the law ... " the veterans group said in a written statement			1
the @entity131 @entity130 is reviewing the interim report , @entity129 , a @entity130 spokesman , said			0

" i have n't said this before , but i think it 's time for gen. @entity40 to move on , " @entity140 said			2
there have been calls from other members of @entity149 for him to step down over the scandal , but @entity140 's voice on military matters carries enormous weight considering his experience as a combat veteran , a @entity157 prisoner of war , and his work in the @entity159 on related issues			0
@entity40 finds himself in a firestorm a number of @entity163 , all up for re-election this year , also called for @entity40 to leave his post			2

" " it 's time for a forceful new leader to address the outrageous problems at the @entity15 , " she said			2
deputy national security adviser @entity192 told @entity59 that president @entity52 has been briefed on the report , and found it " deeply troubling			2
" when pressed on whether @entity52 still supports @entity40 , @entity192 said : " we 're focused on making sure these veterans who 've delivered for this country get the care they need			1
" @entity198 : ' take immediate action ' the @entity15 has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care			2
the @entity15 's inspector general , @entity202 , told a @entity159 committee in recent weeks that his investigation so far had found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in @entity6 , but he added that there was no evidence that excessive waiting was the reason			1
@entity202 recommended that @entity40 " take immediate action " to " review and provide appropriate health care " to the 1,700 veterans identified in @entity6 as not being on a wait list			1
it also recommended that he initiate a nationwide review of waiting lists " to ensure that veterans are seen in an appropriate time , given their clinical condition			0
" the report came just hours before the start of a combative @entity50 committee hearing on the @entity15 issues , where @entity141 and @entity227 leaders said they were dissatisfied with the @entity15 's response to their panel 's subpoena for documents on shortcomings related at the agency 's @entity6 medical center			1
give us the answers , please , " @entity107 , a @entity109 @entity141 , told one of three senior va officials called to testify			0
the committee 's senior @entity239 , @entity241 of @entity242 , was equally sharp with the witnesses , who initially sparred with lawmakers over the agency 's response for documents before answering questions about @entity6			0
" let me be clear , i 'm not happy			0
we 'll get to the bottom of this , " @entity241 said			0
dr. @entity252 , the @entity15 's assistant deputy under secretary for clinical operations , told the committee there are plans in place to contact the 1,700 veterans in @entity6 by the close of business on friday to assess their needs and get them care			1
