-- @entity2 's global governing body @entity1 has licensed two manufacturers to install goal - line technology in stadiums across the world			1
@entity1 announced in october it had approved the use of technology which would help officials decide whether or not a goal had been scored , with providers @entity12 and @entity13 now licensed to produce their respective systems			1
both companies were tested between october 2011 and june 2012 and have been inspected in simulated and real - life match situations			0
the technology will be used for the first time at the 2012 @entity19 in december			2
@entity20 company @entity13 is already well established within sport			0
the technology is already used in both tennis and cricket			0
@entity12 has been developed by @entity26 research institute @entity24 and involves using magnetic strips inside the ball to detect whether or not it has crossed the goal line			1
however , both @entity12 and @entity13 's technology must now pass a stadium test before either system can be used in a match			2
" once a system has been installed in a stadium , the system undergoes a final inspection to check its functionality , " read a statement on @entity1 's website			0
" this is carried out by an independent test institute , and the results of this so - called ' final installation test ' must be successful			0
only a positive final installation test qualifies a system to be used in official matches			0
" while other sports embraced goal - line technology , football dithered over its introduction			1
@entity1 chief @entity53 was only finally convinced of the need to provide technological help for referees after @entity57 were not awarded a goal despite @entity60 's shot clearly bouncing inside the goal during a 4 - 1 defeat by @entity63 in the @entity64 in @entity65			2
however , @entity66 , head of @entity70 football 's lawmakers @entity67 , remains a staunch opponent of the use of technology in football			2
@entity67 has confirmed goal - line technology will not be used in @entity70 competitions such as the @entity77 and the @entity78			1
@entity67 's continental competitions will instead persist with the use of extra officials behind the goal to inform the referee 's decisions			0
the @entity85 is a well - known advocate of goal - line technology , although tuesday 's announcement has come too late for either system to be used in this season 's @entity90 .			1

@entity1 award licenses to goal - line technology developers @entity12 and @entity13
world *soccer* 's lawmakers approved the use of goal - line technology in july
@entity13 is already used in tennis and cricket ; goalref developed by a @entity26 company
the technology will be used for the first time at the @entity19 in @entity107
