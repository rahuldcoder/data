@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity1 court saturday convicted a teenage boy for his part in the gang rape last december of a medical student who later died of her injuries , sentencing him to three years in prison			1
the sentence drew immediate protests outside the court and from the victim 's family , who feel it is too lenient for a crime that shocked the city and prompted a nationwide debate over the treatment of women and the handling of sexual assaults			1

his trial was in juvenile court because he was 17 at the time of the crime , and the three - year sentence is the maximum allowed under the court 's rules			1

the victim 's parents attended the trial and said they plan to appeal			1
" we want him to be hanged , " the victim 's visibly upset mother told reporters			1

then the " driver and the other men raped my friend and hit her in the worst possible ways in the most private parts of her body			0
" the driver used an iron bar in the attack , he told the news agency			2
the friend said he suffered a broken leg			0
" the cruelty i saw should not be seen ever			0
