@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 remembers a time before the abortion debate came to his hometown , a time when @entity1 , @entity0 , was known as the air capital of the world			1
manufacturers such as @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 were the backbone of a tight - knit community where @entity16 - fearing folks like @entity3 would canoe after school in the @entity18 and drag the streets " in slick cars with a nice - looking honey " on weekends			0
times have changed , says @entity3 , 70 , a retired oil refinery worker who also spent time at @entity11			0
" now , @entity1 's known as the abortion capital of the world			1
" it 's a label shunned by many @entity30 , regardless of their views on abortion			2
they 'd rather be known for the restaurants and entertainment venues , quality schools and affordable housing that make @entity1 one of the nation 's " best - kept secrets , " @entity3 says			1
but the may 31 , 2009 , slaying of dr. @entity43 , a prominent abortion provider gunned down in church during sunday services , focused national attention back on @entity1 and its role in one of the most divisive legal and social controversies of our times			1
it faded for a time , as @entity43 's death led to the closure of @entity1 's last abortion clinic , and activists on both sides shifted their focus elsewhere			1
but the trial of @entity43 's admitted shooter , @entity62 , again stirred talk of abortion in the bars and coffee shops of a city where most have steeled themselves for years against noisy protests and graphic images of fetuses			1
@entity62 was convicted friday of first - degree murder			1
after the jury 's swift verdict -- they deliberated for just 37 minutes -- many in @entity1 are hoping the abortion controversy will fade			1
" after he receives his sentence on march 9 -- preferably the @entity79 50 , as district attorney @entity80 is requesting -- he 'll also get the consequence			0
and then may we never hear from him again , " blogged an editorial writer for the local newspaper , the @entity84			0
" maybe this will get things back to normal now , seeing as there 's not much reason for abortion to be such a big issue now that the trial 's over , " @entity3 says			2
" and , now there is no more abortion in @entity1 , either , because the doctor is gone			1
" to @entity98 , @entity43 's death already signified the end of @entity1 's reputation as the world 's abortion capital , albeit through deplorable means			1
" i 'm really not for abortion ... so it 's kind of a fence - riding deal , " says @entity98 , a brick mason who grew up in @entity1			1
" but i feel he has a right to have a business and provide for his family and take care of his business the way he wants to take care of it			0
that 's his right as being an @entity119			0
" for years , demonstrators maintained a constant presence outside @entity43 's @entity123 clinic , a nondescript , cream - colored building of cement and brick facing @entity127 -- the city 's major east - west corridor			1
" people got tired , " says @entity130 , a middle school science teacher			0
" the only way it really affected me was when i 'd have to drive down @entity135 with my young daughters and have them be exposed to these grotesque , brutal images			0
" the turmoil also spread to @entity43 's congregation at @entity140 , where he was ultimately shot to death			1
" they knew what service @entity43 generally attended and they would come out there full - blown with their babies in arms and huge imagery of damaged fetuses , " said @entity142 , a member of the congregation who identifies herself as pro-choice			2
" it got to the point we had to set up partitions so children could exit family vehicles and go into church without having to be exposed to so much of that imagery			0
" frosted glass was installed on the church 's windows , added @entity166			0
the controversy made @entity43 a symbol of hope for the abortion rights movement and a formidable foe of abortion opponents			1
he received repeated death threats and survived a shooting , a clinic bombing , criminal trials and two grand juries intended to put him out of business			2
@entity1 's abortion activism peaked during 1991 's " @entity181 , " when tens of thousands on both sides of the debate gathered in @entity0 to stage protests			1
" what bothered me is that it was n't @entity1 people stirring the pot , so to speak			2
it was n't @entity190 having conflicts with @entity30			0
it was somebody from outside @entity1 coming in and stirring the pot , " said @entity130 , the middle school science teacher			2
" i think everyone felt the same way at that time , " she added			0
" there are other things going on , but our resources , the city was having to extend coverage by local law enforcement , just to have a presence and keep the peace			0
it was an expensive , aggravating time			0
" it was not the first time a conservative social movement claimed the south central @entity0 town as its staging ground			0
early in the 20th century , @entity213 , a voluble evangelist who helped establish the @entity215 , @entity0 , chapter of the @entity216 , brought her fight to @entity1			2
she became a local legend after using a rock and a pool ball to smash up the @entity221 , a downtown bar			0
since then , the former trading post and cattle - drive destination has grown into a sprawling metropolitan area of more than 600,000			0
it covers four counties of flat suburban landscape criss - crossed by railroad tracks about 200 miles southeast of @entity230 an assortment of newer , upscale subdivisions and stately homes a few blocks from older craftsmen and ranch - style homes underscore the city 's evolving landscape			0
much of modern @entity1 's growth has been spurred by the airline industry , along with successful entrepreneurial ventures such as @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 , and three universities			1
a new arena recently opened , and a revitalization of @entity1 's " @entity249 " has produced many new bars , high - end restaurants and entertainment venues in the city center			1
but lifelong residents like @entity3 still gather in the same coffee shops they patronized when they were younger , like the @entity256 , a cozy diner that has changed hands several times but where you can still find breakfast specials for $ 4.99			0
" @entity1 's still a good place to raise a family , but it 's not the same , " he said on a recent morning as his brother , @entity260 , sat across the table , nodding his head			1
" you could say it 's grown too big for its britches			0
" after the @entity181 , things mostly quieted down , resurfacing with an occasional protest that drew national media coverage , or a periodic extreme act directed at @entity43			2
he was shot outside his clinic in 1993 by @entity273 , who has voiced support for @entity62 from prison			2
@entity43 's slaying last year led to the closure of his clinic , which was @entity1 's last abortion clinic			1
@entity278 , an anti-abortion activist and long - time @entity279 , started @entity280 in 1993 , making the closure of " @entity283 's " clinic one of his main goals			0
" he has pretty much always been the focus of our efforts because he 's always been the late - term abortionist			0
he was known not only nationwide but worldwide			0
people came from all over the world to see him , " said @entity278			0
an upbeat man who runs @entity280 for life and a @entity294 dating service from the basement of his suburban @entity1 home , @entity290 has posted a sign on his driveway that greets visitors with the message , " thou shalt not kill " on one side			2
the other side reads , " if you no longer feel close to @entity16 , ask yourself , ' who moved ? ' " " we had 650 volunteers that were involved in the continuous presence at @entity43 's gate , offering help to the women that were going in , " @entity278 said , adding that his group had a " save " rate of about 3.5 unborn babies per month			1
like many anti-abortion organizations across the country , @entity278 has denounced @entity62 's use of violence , calling it a blow to the movement and its credibility			1
he says anti-abortion groups in @entity1 were only months away from shutting @entity43 down through official channels			1
the debate over health care policy has mobilized his group 's efforts to lobby politicians and gather signatures on the web site , abortionisnothealthcare.com			2
" i do n't have time to think about @entity62 because we 're too busy trying to keep abortion out of health care , " he said			1
next to the building that once housed @entity43 's clinic , a pregnancy counseling clinic called @entity340 has no plans to close			1
in fact , since @entity43 's death , @entity340 has seen an increase in clients , spokeswoman @entity342 said			1
" we will continue to provide services to women as long as they keep coming through our doors , " she said			0
abortion rights activists such as @entity166 are determined to see a new abortion clinic open in @entity1 eventually			2
" dr. @entity43 's death kind of forces us to keep going , to make noise and fight so there is a safe and legal option , " she says			1
" he was a hero for all women			0
" but to @entity130 , @entity43 's death may further strain the bonds of a once tight - knit community			1
@entity1 has endured other violent crimes , including the @entity361 serial killer @entity361 , who evaded authorities for 30 years			2
still , @entity43 's death within the sacred confines of a church struck a deep chord			1
" what does this say for your openness to others ? do we have to lock the church narthex after service begins or check your @entity376 at the door ? " she says			0
" [ @entity62 's ] biggest impact is going to be he caused us to be suspicious of each other			2
unfortunately , i think it makes you even more hesitant to embrace a stranger			0

some say abortion provider 's death marks end of @entity1 's reputation as " abortion capital "
@entity62 was convicted friday of killing abortion provider dr. @entity43
the shooting stirred *emotions* among residents who had wearied of the abortion debate
