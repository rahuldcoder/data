@entity2 @entity1 officials are looking at changing prime minister @entity5 's plans to address a joint meeting of @entity7 , including potentially relocating the speech , according to an @entity1 source			1
the debate follows mounting criticism of @entity5 's move to use the high profile address to criticize president @entity15 's policy on @entity16			1
while a range of ideas are being discussed there is no final decision yet , the @entity1 source stressed			0
an official in prime minister @entity5 's office insists " at this moment " the speech is still on , suggesting the @entity1 were leaving themselves some wiggle room			1
" in recent days the prime minister has received a number of inquiries about his visit to the @entity31			0
at this moment there is no change to the plans , " this official told @entity3			0
house speaker @entity36 invited @entity5 last month to speak in the @entity38 chamber , but did not consult with the @entity38 before officially reaching out to the @entity1 leader			1
the speech is slated for march 3 but many congressional democrats have urged the @entity1 leader to reconsider delivering the speech , and have also asked the speaker to shift the date			1
they argue the timing -- two weeks before the election in @entity1 -- is inappropriate			0
but @entity48 ' larger issue with the speech is it gives @entity5 a broad public platform for his strong criticism of the @entity52 's negotiations with @entity16			1
they worry that the @entity1 leader 's message could jeopardize the international talks over @entity16 's nuclear program , which are approaching a critical deadline			0
a move to shift the speech to a venue outside the @entity61 , or deliver the speech in a closed chamber could be a face saving compromise for @entity5			1
he could still deliver his sharp message on @entity16 , but also repair the damage he 's done to his relationship with @entity69 , who are angry their allegiance to a key ally is being questioned			0
@entity73 , the @entity1 ambassador to the @entity31 made the rounds last week on @entity75 , meeting with frustrated @entity48 , including some @entity77 members , who lashed out at his handling of the matter			0
@entity80 met with rep. @entity81 of @entity82 , the top @entity83 on the @entity84			0
he also met with others including rep. @entity86 , @entity87 - @entity82 , rep. @entity88 , @entity89 , rep. @entity90 , @entity91 , rep. @entity92 , @entity93 , rep. @entity94 , @entity87 - @entity82			0
while affirming their support for @entity1 , these members urged @entity5 to reconsider coming to the @entity38 floor , and suggested moving the speech to another venue -- anywhere in @entity2 outside the chamber , according to one source familiar with these discussions			1
an @entity1 source says they are looking at the possibility of @entity5 speaking somewhere else , or in a closed session on the @entity38 floor			1
in exchange for the shift , @entity5 would potentially add a meeting with top congressional leaders to his schedule			1
they also hope to have a meeting with @entity38 officials in which the president could drop by , though there 's little evidence the administration is interested in making such a deal			0
one senior @entity38 @entity121 leadership aide tells @entity3 the speaker 's office is moving forward with plans for @entity5 's visit			2
@entity15 acknowledged his " very real difference " with @entity5 over @entity16 at a joint press conference with @entity129 chancellor @entity128 on monday			2
he also reiterated his position that he did n't support a public address so close to the @entity1 election			2
" we have a practice of not meeting with leaders right before their elections , two weeks before their elections			0
as much as i love @entity128 , if she was two weeks away from an election , she probably would not have received an invitation to the @entity38 , and i suspect she would n't have asked for one , " @entity15 said			0
on friday , vice president @entity142 's office announced he would not attend the speech because he will be traveling abroad			2
when foreign leaders are invited to address the @entity38 and @entity145 , the vice president typically attends speeches and sits on the dais behind the leader - a public image beamed around the world			2
@entity142 's office did not release any details of his trip but said it had been in the works for a while			0
" as we have consistently said , this is an event that was coordinated between the @entity1 and speaker @entity36			0
we are not playing a role in this event , " a senior @entity52 official told @entity3			0
last week , @entity163 @entity162 said she hoped that @entity5 's speech would be cancelled			1
while @entity162 conceded that she had no reason from her discussions with @entity1 officials to think that the speech that @entity5 would withdraw from the invitation , she strongly suggested circumstances could change			1
" you never know , things happen in people 's schedules , " @entity162 said			0
asked if she planned to attend the joint meeting , @entity162 said , " as of now it is my intention to go			0
" but other @entity48 , including several members of the @entity179 , say they will boycott the speech if it goes ahead as scheduled			2
@entity5 's @entity182 party is in a close election race with the center - left opposition led by @entity186 chairman @entity185 and former justice minister @entity187 , who leads a small centrist party			2
both @entity185 and @entity187 , who have teamed up to form an alliance in the election , have criticized @entity5 's decision to address @entity7 and have urged him to cancel it			1
@entity5 has campaigned on a tough - against - @entity16 platform and has been accused of using the speech as a way to play up those credentials with voters			1
on sunday , he addressed @entity198 - speaking members of his @entity182 party , doubling down on the decision to address @entity7 on march 3 , saying " i will go any place i 'm invited to convey the @entity1 position against those who want to kill us "			1
but there are signs the controversy is impacting @entity5 's standing in the polls , with the @entity1 media and public voicing concern that @entity5 is contributing to further strains between @entity1 and the @entity31 , its closest ally			1
an @entity215 poll on monday said only 34 % of @entity1 think @entity5 should go ahead with the address , while 47 % think he should cancel			1
another poll published by the @entity218 on monday showed @entity5 's party four seats in the @entity221 behind @entity185 and @entity187 's @entity223 alliance			2
@entity3 's @entity224 contributed to this report			0
