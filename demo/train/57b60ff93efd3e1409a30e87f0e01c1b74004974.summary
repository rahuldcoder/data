-- @entity2 security policy showed the effects of two substantial pivots this past week : ramping down our role in regime transformation in one @entity9 country even while ramping up our responsibility in another			1
first to @entity11 , where the death of @entity13 has finally ended the first act of what promises to be a long drama			1
as @entity18 and @entity19 have amply proven , collapsing the old regime is the easy part ; building a functioning civil society is the real challenge			2
@entity13 's apparent execution after he was captured , on top of the still unexplained murder of the @entity28 forces ' commander @entity26 three months ago , highlights the chaos and infighting that still exist in @entity11 and the need to help the @entity11 build a viable state			1
@entity33 : investigate @entity13 's killing as a war crime there is more than altruistic international good citizenship involved here			2
if @entity11 is left to its own devices , it is not difficult to conceive of it becoming @entity41 on the @entity42 , an ungoverned space threatening the heart of @entity45 as well as critical international lines of communication			1
we have already begun to fret over the loss of control of thousands of man - portable surface - to - air missiles			0
these are reasons enough to stay engaged			0
there are other effects from this week 's success that will also need to be managed			2
@entity57 stretched the @entity59 ' mandate to " protect civilians " as far as legally possible ( about as far as we domestically stretched the definition of " not war " ) , actively isolated portions of the battlefield to ensure local advantage to the @entity28 fighters , and conducted what at times looked like close air support -- integrating @entity57 airpower with the fire and movement of their ground forces			0
what impact will being the air force for the @entity77 's fighters have on @entity80 members when next they face a question of " protecting " civilian populations ? are reprisals an inevitable byproduct of revolution ? the @entity11 success will also have to be managed within @entity57			2
it was @entity2 intelligence , surveillance , reconnaissance , defense suppression , electronic warfare , refueling and precision weapons that kept the alliance in the game			2
will the lesson be that @entity45 will have to do more in the future ? or did the @entity11 adventure teach them that current levels of investment are " good enough " ? it 's not an idle question , as many seem to already be crowding around the exits in @entity19			2
and this week 's events in @entity11 will have regional impacts			1
for @entity110 and @entity111 , they hold the long - term prospect of a like - minded neighbor			0
for rulers in @entity116 and @entity117 , they pose an existential question : does @entity11 teach me what happens if i stay too long ? or does it simply reinforce what i already knew -- that the stakes of this game are very high and i have to do whatever i have to do to win ? for rulers in @entity126 the issue is less ambiguous : so this is what the @entity128 might do to you if you give up your nuclear program			1
@entity13 and son buried in undisclosed location while managing these byproducts of success in @entity11 , the president also announced that , by the end of the year , " the last @entity2 soldier will cross the border out of @entity18 with their head held high , proud of their success			1
" for some in the @entity2 and in @entity18 this was a rewarding moment , the end of a bad chapter for both peoples			1
others , though , smell danger			0
many had expected a sustained @entity2 presence ; even @entity18 military leaders had talked about the continuing need for training , intelligence , logistics and air defense from the @entity2			1
there was also just the raw political impact of a continued @entity2 footprint			0
in the north , @entity2 on the ground had dampened native passions along an @entity9 - @entity166 - @entity165 fault line			1
@entity2 presence overall gave heart to those in the @entity18 political spectrum who would oppose undue @entity171 influence in @entity18 affairs			1
that presence also seemed to help manage @entity175 reaction ( and potential overreaction ) to @entity178 raids allegedly mounted from @entity18			0
and for @entity18 sunnis , a visible @entity2 footprint was often seen as their best guarantee against the actions of what many viewed as a predatory @entity185 government			1
in short , a continued @entity2 presence was seen as calming , buying time for @entity18 politics and institutions to grow to meet the demands they are facing			2
to be sure , the @entity2 is not abandoning @entity18			2
our talented ambassador there , @entity191 , will have some 16,000 government employees and contractors under his command			0
but this is not the same as an enduring military presence			0
many seemed to realize this			0
@entity2 commanders in @entity18 regularly called for a substantial five - figure residual force , and two successive secretaries of defense advocated publicly for a continued @entity2 presence , even as the president they served did not draw back from his campaign commitment to end the @entity2 military 's role there			1
in the end , though , it was the @entity18 , and especially prime minister @entity212 , who could not deliver on the one nonnegotiable @entity2 demand -- immunity from @entity18 law for @entity2 troops			1
no @entity2 administration could accept anything less			0
given @entity212 's worldview and his fragile political situation , it was hard enough to wrest this concession from him in 2008			0
it required a sustained , unrelenting , personal effort from the highest levels of the @entity2 government , and success was never guaranteed			0
it is not clear that similar efforts were made in 2011			0
@entity230 makes war policy an election strength in any event , the president chalked up the @entity2 withdrawal as a " promise kept , " even as his officials worked to the last minute to sustain a @entity2 presence			0
in both @entity18 and @entity11 it was an interesting week : engagement and disengagement , leadership and resignation , moving in and moving out -- with both the burden and the necessity of global leadership on clear display			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			0

last week saw death of @entity13 , plan to withdraw all @entity2 troops from @entity18
@entity250 : @entity2 is ramping up its responsibility in one @entity9 country , leaving another
he says it 's vital to make sure @entity11 does *n't* turn into a " @entity41 on the @entity42 "
@entity250 : rulers in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity171 will draw lessons from fate of @entity13
