-- the remains of a man who confessed to being the @entity3 were exhumed friday by authorities working to connect him to the january 1964 killing of @entity7 , the last of 11 women believed killed by the serial killer			1
new dna tests on a secret sample collected from a relative of suspect @entity15 triggered the exhumation after authorities said there was a " a familial match " with genetic material preserved in the killing of 19 - year - old @entity7 , @entity11 district attorney @entity10 said thursday			1
authorities made the match through dna taken from a water bottle thrown away by @entity15 's nephew , he said			1
@entity15 's remains were removed from @entity28 in @entity29 , north of @entity30 , to the state medical examiner 's office , where dna tests will be performed			1
authorities said they believe the results will come back quickly , perhaps in a few days			2
the @entity36 killings terrorized @entity30 from mid- 1962 to early 1964			2
@entity10 said 11 killings have been attributed to @entity15 -- who confessed to the deaths -- including @entity7 's			1
@entity15 also confessed to two additional killings , which were not suspected @entity3 victims			1
city of fear : photos from the @entity30 strangler era , 1963 @entity15 was never charged with the killings			1
he was stabbed to death in 1973 while serving a life prison term for unrelated rapes			1
the news has convinced @entity7 's nephew , @entity49 , who wrote a 2001 book in which he argued that another man may have been behind the @entity36 killings			2
he said thursday that he was surprised his aunt 's slaying was still being investigated			0
" it 's taken 49 years for police to legitimately say they got their man , and they 'll probably be able to say that very soon , " @entity49 said			0
but a lawyer for the @entity61 told @entity0 the family was " outraged , disgusted and offended " by the decision to secretly take a dna sample of one of its members , a move she called " unnecessary and creepy			0
" " they feel victimized by this process , " said the attorney , @entity69			0
" this was an unwarranted invasion of privacy by a government agency			0
we have offered them dna as recently as last year			0
there was no reason to sneak around to get it			0
" scientists tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate dna evidence from semen found in @entity7 's body and on a blanket , authorities said			0
they resumed their efforts last year , after a laboratory successfully salvaged dna from decades - old material , and found what they believe is the unique genetic profile of @entity7 's killer			0
@entity96 : fast facts despite an exhaustive search , investigators found no usable samples of @entity15 's @entity77 to compare with the material from the crime scene			2
so @entity30 police commissioner @entity103 said he had a detective from the police department 's fugitive squad shadow @entity15 relatives until he spotted one of the suspect 's nephews throwing away a water bottle			2
the nephew was working at an outdoor construction site when he threw away the plastic bottle , which was retrieved by plainclothes investigators , according to a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
@entity10 said authorities did n't ask the @entity15 family for their cooperation , but he defended the secret collection of their dna as " a fair and legal and ethical method			1
" @entity15 's brother , @entity123 , offered blood and saliva samples in hopes of proving his brother 's innocence in 2001			2
those tests had been unable to find a match between @entity15 family @entity77 and the killings , but @entity10 discounted them thursday because they were n't conducted by law enforcement			1
@entity0 's @entity135 and @entity136 contributed to this report .			0

authorities never *definitively* linked @entity141 to the killings
he was never charged in those crimes , and he was killed in prison in 1973
