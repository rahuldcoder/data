-- secretary of state @entity1 landed in @entity2 , @entity3 , friday for talks with president @entity5			2
the @entity6 hopes to make progress on a long - stalled security deal with @entity3 that would leave some @entity6 forces in the country beyond @entity12 's scheduled departure at the end of 2014			1
@entity6 officials say they hope to conclude a deal on the @entity16 , or @entity17 , in the " coming weeks " and before @entity5 meets with a council of tribal elders next month			2
without a deal , the @entity6 would keep no military forces in @entity3 once the combat mission ends			1
in @entity24 , all @entity6 troops left at the end of 2011 after the two countries were unable to reach a similar agreement			2
the @entity3 negotiations , which started last october , were supposed to be completed within a year			2
but issues related to @entity3 sovereignty and @entity6 security guarantees for that country have made a deal elusive			1
senior @entity6 officials tell @entity0 the text of an agreement is about 95 % complete , but two main issues remain unresolved			2
the sticking points involve @entity3 's refusal to let @entity6 forces conduct counterterrorism operations against @entity42 operatives			1
@entity5 wants the @entity6 to hand over intelligence and allow @entity3 troops to conduct those operations , something the @entity6 has balked at			1
@entity5 also is insisting on an @entity6 guarantee of @entity3 's security , similar to agreements the @entity6 would have with a @entity12 ally or a country with a mutual defense treaty			1
such a pact might compel the @entity6 to send troops into @entity55 if @entity3 was attacked			1
a former @entity57 chairman , @entity1 has made multiple trips to @entity3 in recent years			2
a state department official who briefed reporters on the way to @entity2 said they hope @entity1 and @entity5 will make progress in the negotiations , but they do n't expect to close a deal			1
" they will of course be discussing where we are and seek to continue to make progress , " the official said			1
" now negotiations were ongoing before we arrived and they will be ongoing after we depart from @entity2 , so that was not the expectation in terms of a conclusion			0
" the @entity3 leader , known for emotional rants against the @entity6 and @entity12 forces , cast doubt this week on whether a deal could be reached			1
at a press conference , he issued a sharp rebuke to @entity6 and @entity12 forces in his country over a recent @entity12 airstrike in @entity84 that the @entity3 government claimed killed five civilians			1
" the @entity6 and @entity12 have not respected our sovereignty , " @entity5 said			2
" whenever they find it suitable to them , they have acted against it			0
this has been a serious point of contention between us and that is why we are taking issue of the @entity17 strenuously in the negotiations right now			0
" referring to @entity6 insistence on handling counterterrorism operations , @entity5 said , " the @entity6 and its allies , @entity12 , continue to demand even after signing the @entity17 they will have the freedom to attack our people , our villages			1
the @entity3 people will never allow it			0
" in an interview with @entity111 last week , president @entity109 warned he would keep troops in @entity3 only if the @entity6 got want it wanted in any agreement			1
@entity114 , a senior fellow at the @entity115 and author of the forthcoming book " no exit from @entity55 , " says that while the remaining issues are few in number , their importance could hinder chances for a deal			0
" these sticking points , even if the differences have been narrowed , are sticky enough that there is some serious question as to whether this will happen before president @entity5 leaves office , " @entity114 said			0
" and the lack of an agreement will be harmful to the potential legacy of a stable and smooth transition , " he added			0
" there are so many other reasons to be worried about @entity3 : the economy , the election and the lack of progress in dealing with reconciliation with the @entity142			2
this is one more thing that does n't need to be added to the mix. " @entity146 is racing against two clocks -- one related to @entity3 's election next april , and the other involving military planning			2
@entity5 has suggested his successor should be the one to conclude negotiations with the @entity6			0
@entity6 officials and analysts have voiced concern that @entity3 would take to the polls amid uncertainty about the future relationship with the @entity6			1
" it is easy to see that we become an issue in the campaign , and not in a way that serves the @entity6 interests , " @entity114 said			0
" there could be a competition to show who is least willing to kowtow to the @entity6			0
and then when they negotiate in that way , you never get a @entity17			0
then you have an @entity24 situation , where we have to leave			0
but for @entity3 , it 's more dangerous			0
it 's even more unstable and the regional consequences are of greater concern to @entity176 , @entity55 and even @entity177			0
" moreover , the lack of a deal would impact @entity12 's military planning			0
the @entity6 wants to give its troops , and those of other countries , enough time to prepare for keeping troops in @entity3			1
other @entity12 countries , including @entity187 , say they will be unable to remain in @entity3 if the @entity6 and @entity3 do not reach a deal			1
a total withdrawal would also put at risk billions of dollars in international aid			0
" as a practical matter it will be difficult for us and our @entity12 partners to deliver on pledges we have made regarding both security and economic programs , " one senior administration official said .			0
