@entity0 -- pro basketball is a staple of @entity5 athletics , taking its place with @entity7 and the @entity8 as one of the pre-eminent @entity5 sports leagues			0
and it 's big business , too , pumping tens of millions of dollars into the @entity5 economy			2
so the owner of the @entity15 raised eyebrows this week when he said he planned to transfer ownership of the team to a company in @entity20 -- at a time when tension between the @entity5 and @entity20 is at its highest level since the end of the @entity25			1
that raised two questions : will it happen ? does it matter ? the billionaire owner , @entity30 , monday reiterated his year - old intention to transfer the @entity15 ownership base to @entity20 , but has since toned down his rhetoric			1
" this is a long process which may or may not come to fruition and nothing is imminent , " @entity30 's company , @entity34 , which owns the @entity36 basketball team , said in a statement released via the @entity15			1
" of course , no steps in this direction could or would be taken without the full knowledge and approval of the @entity36			0
" on monday , the 48 year - old @entity20 national told reporters in @entity46 , " i have already stated that i will transfer the basketball club ( under the @entity20 jurisdiction ) , " according to @entity20 news agency @entity49			1
not so fast , the @entity36 said , telling @entity1 the transfer has yet to begin			0
" the @entity15 are owned by @entity30 through a @entity5 - based company , " @entity51 , executive vice president of @entity36 communications , told @entity1			2
" we have received no official application , nor is there a process under way through our office to transfer the ownership of the @entity15 to another company			1
" if an application to change ownership was submitted by the @entity15 , 75 % of @entity36 team owners -- or 23 of 30 -- would have to approve the move , @entity51 said			1
he said that the @entity36 's board of governors ( the 30 team owners ) would have to decide whether there are any issues with the transfer of ownership application			2
currently , the @entity36 has no rules prohibiting a foreign company from owning an @entity36 team			0
the back - and - forth comes as @entity20 president @entity76 pushes @entity20 businessmen to " de-offshore " companies owned abroad			1
last week , @entity76 stressed the importance of bringing the companies home and making them pay @entity20 taxes to help grow the economy , according to the @entity86 website			1
" entrepreneurs need to understand their responsibility , " @entity76 told a group of @entity20 businessmen last week			2
" our priority stance is that @entity20 companies have to be registered here , in their home country and have a transparent ownership structure			1
" @entity94 is described as a private investment holding company that owns or manages various metals companies , financial companies and media outlets , as well as the @entity15 , according to the site			1
in recent weeks , @entity100 has imposed sanctions on senior @entity20 officials and what officials called " cronies " of @entity76 , as well as a bank , after warning @entity76 against annexing @entity105 from @entity106			2
president @entity109 also signed an executive order that authorizes his administration to target @entity20 companies vital to the economy , including financial services , energy , metals and mining			1
when asked about the idea of a basketball team transferring its ownership to be based in @entity20 , the @entity118 declined to comment			1
@entity122 says the discussions to move the @entity15 under @entity20 's jurisdiction began in the spring of 2013			1
at the time , @entity30 intended to run for public office and the move was an attempt to comply with @entity20 laws regarding political candidates			1
" @entity30 was not in any way tying it to the current political situation , " @entity130 , director for international projects at the communications adviser group @entity132 , said this week			1
@entity30 called the move " an outstanding opportunity to use @entity36 technologies for the step - by - step development of basketball in @entity20 , " according to @entity49			1
@entity140 , director of @entity20 research and emerging markets at @entity143 , a global political risk and consulting firm , said there is a basic agreement between @entity76 and oligarchs permitting them to make money as long as they stay out of government			1
they 're also expected to comply with government demands , he said			0
" @entity30 is falling into line with the @entity86 's broader emphasis on returning the assets of @entity20 's wealthiest businessmen back to @entity20 , " @entity140 said			1
" there 's a political dimension to that : to ensure that the wealthiest are as dependent on him as possible and as independent of the west as possible			2
" @entity20 's oligarchs always had to balance keeping assets at home versus abroad , @entity140 said , but pressure has been increasing			1
" for a long time the political risk of keeping assets in @entity20 appeared to be higher , but in the past month that has shifted because of pressure from both the @entity86 and the @entity171 , " @entity140 added			2
@entity172 , associate director of the @entity173 , said such a move in the sports world could be complicated by the current political situation			1
" any type of moves that take into consideration the residency of who owns the team would be impacted by whatever laws in the country in which they reside and any type of sanctions that currently or could potentially be placed on a country , such as @entity20 , " @entity172 said			0
if @entity36 team owners gather to discuss the transfer they have to consider the best interest of the league and owners , as well the ramifications of ownership change , he said			0
" anyone that has a background , like @entity30 , that could be aligned with sanctions , needs to be taken seriously , " @entity172 said			0
he added : " the @entity36 as a whole wants draw from a large audience			0
they want to focus on the talent and competition on the court , they do n't necessarily want to link up with geopolitical issues			0
" " unless the move raises issues with the league or the @entity5 government , @entity15 fans probably should n't be worried			2
as long as the @entity15 ownership group is financially sound and not running afoul of those groups , the team wo n't likely feel much of an impact , " @entity172 said			2
@entity30 became principal owner of the @entity15 in 2010			2
he bought 80 % of the team , as well as a 45 % stake in the @entity216 , the iconic new facility the team has called home since 2012			0
the @entity15 are worth $ 780 million , the 5th most valuable franchise in the @entity36 , according to @entity219			0
@entity30 -- worth $ 10.4 billion , the 120th richest person in the world and the 11th richest in @entity20 , according to @entity219 -- gained his wealth through minerals and metal investments in the years after the fall of communism in the early 1990s			0
he 's got a reputation as a financial sage			0
" i like business , it 's my profession , " @entity30 told @entity1 's @entity228 in 2011			0
" i spend , like , 15 hours a day in the office			0
it 's the great joy in my life , and i never think about money			0
" @entity30 has shown interest in politics in the past , and even ran for president in @entity20 as an independent against @entity76 in 2012			0
at the time , some saw him as too close to the regime in power			0
many @entity241 suspected the @entity86 put @entity30 up to garner some legitimate votes without being a true threat to @entity76 , giving the impression that the contest was fair			0
@entity1 's @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0
