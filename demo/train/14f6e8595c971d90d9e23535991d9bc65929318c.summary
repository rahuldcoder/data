-- the following is an excerpt of an article from the november 11 , 2010 issue of " @entity0			0
" this issue is available friday , october 29th on newsstands and online via @entity0 's premium subscription plan			0
in july , shortly after his legally prohibited from being @entity9 wrapped up , @entity8 began visiting the set of his new talk show , at @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
for various reasons , the show had not been staffed yet , nor had the set been built , so on those days , @entity8 would occasionally pause en route to his office and stand alone in a giant , empty warehouse			1
as career meta ­ phors go , one could do worse : at least the warehouse was n't on fire , or dripping blood from the ceiling , or filled , floor to rafters , with an existentially crushing number of identical wooden crates , like the warehouse at the end of @entity32 of the @entity33 video : behind the scenes at @entity38 's death - defying @entity0 cover shoot @entity8 had lost his dream job as host of " @entity41 " in january , at a speed ( seven months ! ) almost as humiliating as the circumstances of his departure ( ousted for @entity45 , which is the comedy - world equivalent of being left at the altar for a cast member of " @entity49 " )			1
" my wife says those first couple of months , the thing i said most often was , ' wait a minute , what just happened ? ' " @entity8 recalls			2
' @entity38 ' premieres november 8 on @entity54 " those weeks after the tour , where not much was going on , @entity38 was miserable , " confirms his wife , @entity55 , a blunt and dryly funny former advertising executive with whom @entity8 has two children			1
" that was when he was the most depressed			0
" @entity60 says she had " all sorts of grand designs " about keeping her idled spouse busy : he would be responsible for camp drop - offs , he would cook dinner at least one night a week			2
none of which ended up happening			0
@entity8 did go for long bicycle rides , and read lots of history books			2
at a parents ' night at their son @entity74 's preschool , there was a stack of volunteer sign - up sheets , and @entity8 , who still had too much time on his hands , became overly ambitious and started signing up for everything : " oh , i 'd love to come talk to the kids about natural history ! " listen to two tracks from @entity8 's live album recorded with @entity88 " he was in the house all the time , " @entity60 recalls			1
" i said , ' this ca n't last -- it 'll drive us crazy ! ' literally every 10 minutes , he 'd poke his head in the room and say , ' i do n't wan na bother you , but do you know where the @entity96 are ? ' ' i do n't wan na bother you , but do you know how to use the phone ? ' he was so sweet about it , and i felt like such a jerk			0
but seriously , i almost rented an office for him			0
" the morning after @entity8 's final ­ " @entity41 " -- his second - highest - rated episode ever , quadrupling his average nightly viewership -- he and @entity60 drove up to a resort in @entity105			1
" i felt like i 'd just been in a car accident , " @entity8 says			2
" like a crazy mix of elation , anger , sorrow			0
confusion was a big one			0
" that night , when they entered the dining room and the other guests stood up and applauded , @entity8 says , " it almost made me cry			1
" photos : from " @entity117 " to " @entity118 , " see tv stars on the cover of " @entity0 " an overachieving golden boy since high school ( where he was class valedictorian ) , on through college ( @entity123 , where he was twice voted president of " the @entity125 , " something that had only happened once before in the history of the venerable humor magazine ) and his early career ( staff gigs at " @entity131 " and " @entity132 " , the twin @entity133 of the comedy world for the aspiring writer ) , @entity8 had been plucked from obscurity to host a major - network talk show -- at a time when people still watched network television -- when he was a preposterously young - looking 30 years old			1
losing " @entity143 " was the first time he had ever failed so publicly , and in such epic fashion			0
his longtime sidekick , @entity146 , has said , " it was traumatic for @entity38			2
" " i hated to see him in such a state of tension and unhappiness , " @entity60 says			0
" it was very painful for him to let go of this hallowed ground that he 'd finally got a chance to stand on			0
" but , she goes on , " there were so many factors at work , such a confluence of change that had to do with so much more than him			0
the truth is , " @entity41 " was the definition of cultural relevancy for decades			2
and all of a sudden , it 's not			0
that 's not @entity38 's fault			1
it 's not anybody 's fault			0
and it 's no longer a show he should be pinning his life 's hopes on hosting			2
" what does @entity38 have that you do n't ? @entity178 's 1996 " @entity0 " cover story indeed , the spontaneous @entity181 internet campaign generated by fans in january -- complete with @entity184 - style iconography and its very own slogan , " i 'm with @entity8 " -- was driven largely by young people for whom the venerable institution of " @entity41 " meant little or nothing			1
for some , the show might have even made @entity8 less cool by association			1
the " @entity41 " had been unhip for a very , very long time , not just for the past 17 years it has been hosted by @entity45 , but for ( let 's be honest ) pretty much all of the @entity197 -- really , the last time it was hip , @entity193 and his guests were still chain - smoking on the air -- and so watching @entity8 move behind the desk of desks felt less like an ascension and more like a loss , a co-opting of our guy			1
consequently , when @entity8 was undone by @entity208 's fecklessness and @entity45 's treachery , it only affirmed what we knew all along : he 'd thrown his lot in with the wrong crowd			1
overnight , @entity8 not only regained the underdog status he 'd held for much of his career , but actually found himself in a wholly new position : rebranded as an indie icon			2
in the months that followed , he grew a beard , played @entity220 and cut an improvised spoken - word single and a rock covers album for @entity88 's label			1
( " @entity38 's was the only late - night show i ever wanted to play , " @entity88 says			1
" @entity225 is so cold to people , and @entity45 is for senior citizens			0
i played a live guitar solo on @entity38 's desk once			1
if i did that on @entity225 , he 'd probably have had a coronary			0
" ) when @entity8 announced his 30 - city comedy tour via @entity233 , without any traditional promotion whatsoever , it sold out in hours			2
