@entity0 -- two commercial jets that nearly collided north of @entity4 last month were at altitudes assigned to them by air traffic controllers , the @entity2 tells @entity1			1
the cause of the near - disaster in the skies east of the @entity10 on april 25 is still under investigation			1
but a source with knowledge of the probe said the early focus is finding out why the planes were assigned to altitudes that put them dangerously close			0
the incident was brought to public attention when a passenger on one of the planes wrote a blog titled : " two weeks ago , i almost died in the @entity24			1
" in the incident , @entity25 1205 , which was headed east to @entity26 from @entity27 on the @entity28 of @entity4 , had to descend quickly to avoid a westbound @entity30 jet , approximately 200 miles northeast of @entity27			1
the @entity25 pilots received an audible warning that the plane was in danger from its traffic collision avoidance system , which monitors airspace around a plane			1
both planes were @entity38 757s			0
flight - tracking websites show the @entity25 plane descended 600 feet in 60 seconds			1
the passenger who wrote the blog post , @entity45 , described feeling weightless as the @entity25 plane suddenly plunged			1
" i felt my body float upwards and strain against my seatbelt , " @entity45 wrote			2
" passengers around me screamed			0
there was a loud crash in the back -- a coffeepot clattering to the floor and tumbling down the aisle			0
our tray tables began rattling in unison as the 757 strained through the kind of maneuver meant more for a fighter jet			0
" @entity45 estimated a total of 590 people were on the two planes -- based on the assumption that the other plane carried the same number of passengers and crew as the 295 people aboard his flight			2
thus , according to @entity45 , the death toll in a collision would have been the worst air disaster in history , surpassing the 583 who died in the 1977 runway collision of two @entity80 on a runway on the @entity83 island of @entity84			2
however , airlines officials this week declined to say how many people were on the two passenger jets in last month 's incident			1
@entity45 said he believes it was his report that led the @entity91 to investigate			0
he said he wants to make sure near collisions are thoroughly investigated			0
" i do n't think there 's some epidemic of near accidents that occurring , but it was a jarring experience dodging another plane , " he said			0
an @entity91 official , speaking on background , said the agency began investigating immediately after the incident , and independent of @entity45 's report			2
on thursday , a joint @entity91 - @entity2 team arrived at the @entity103 to continue the investigation , the @entity2 said			0
commercial airline pilot @entity105 said the collision avoidance systems worked as designed			1
" you 're going to run into this situation , unfortunately			0
i know that 's not a comforting answer , but indeed the system worked , " @entity105 told @entity1			2
