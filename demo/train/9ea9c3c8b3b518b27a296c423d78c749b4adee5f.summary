-- fancy gadgets that can be used to jam cell phone signals are illegal and potentially dangerous , experts say			1
so , why was @entity4 lighting up monday with people searching for them ? you can thank a guy in @entity8 who got fed up with folks yakking during his daily bus ride and a local news reporter who happens to ride the same bus			1
days after the story broke on friday , the apparently fresh interest in the devices , which can be had online for anywhere from less than $ 40 to more than $ 1,000 , is cause for concern among some security experts			1
" the general public does n't realize what they 're jamming if they were to start using these things , " said @entity19 , an assistant professor of computer and information technology at @entity22 who specializes in cyberforensics			0
" what 's not obvious is all the wireless connectivity systems that are in the background and maintaining data communications in our daily lives			2
" last week , @entity8 tv station @entity35 reported on a man who admitted to using a cell - phone jammer during his bus commute to shut down fellow passengers when they were talking loudly			1
" i guess i 'm taking the law into my own hands , and quite frankly , i 'm proud of it , " said the man , who the station identified only as " @entity42			1
" he called people using their phones on public buses irritating and rude			2
" a lot of people are extremely loud , no sense of , just , privacy or anything , " said " @entity42 , " who was first noticed by a writer for the station			1
" when it becomes a bother , that 's when i screw on the antenna and flip the switch			0
and , apparently , piqued people 's interest			1
throughout the weekend , and as recently as monday afternoon , " cell phone jammer " was one of the top 10 searches on @entity65 , cropping up between searches for @entity68 's " @entity67 " performance and news about the @entity72 primaries			1
the legality of the jammers varies from country to country			2
in the @entity79 , it is generally illegal to sell , own or use one without the government 's permission			0
the devices are offered for sale on a handful of websites			0
@entity19 , a former communications electronic warfare officer in the @entity88 , said law enforcement has " very specific worries " about how cell - phone jammers could be used by criminals			1
but even someone looking to do no more than hush an annoying neighbor on the bus could do some harm , he said			0
for example , in the @entity8 case , the jammer could have cut off the bus driver 's communication with a dispatcher who was trying to communicate emergency or traffic information			1
and that 's not to mention other folks in the area ( aside from the offensive loud talkers ) who may have missed potentially important phone calls			2
" who is he to play god with our cellphones ? " @entity19 said			0
jammers work in much the same way online denial - of - service attacks on websites do -- transmitting a signal on the same frequency as mobile phone calls in the area			1
" in layman 's terms , they basically just interrupt the signals in the area , " @entity19 said			0
" they are a louder signal , if you will , than anything else in the area			0
as a phone tries to connect to a tower , it ca n't because there 's this other noise , if you will , in the way			0
" under federal law , illegally using a jammer can result in jail time and fines up to $ 16,000			2
so , if they 're illegal and potentially harmful , why is it so easy to find a jammer online ? " it 's the internet			0
i can buy anything i want , anywhere at any time , " @entity19 said			0
" unfortunately , it 's all about the dollar			0

@entity8 bus rider spurs interest in cell phone jammers
local tv station *interviews* man " taking the law into his own hands " to quiet cell talkers
experts say people using the devices could jam police , other communications , too
still , jammers from $ 40 to more than $ 1,000 can be found online
