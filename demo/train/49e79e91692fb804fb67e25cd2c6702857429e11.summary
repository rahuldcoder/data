editor 's note : fashion season : @entity3 takes you behind the scenes of the @entity3 catwalks and beyond , exploring the @entity10 capital 's most stylish hidden corners			1
the show airs monday 24 to friday 28 february on @entity12 , with daily reports in ' @entity14 ' at 1300 gmt and ' @entity16 ' at 2000 @entity15 ( @entity17 ) -- there 's something about floating translucent bubbles that 's always seemed futuristic , from the ' 60s right up to the present day			0
photographer @entity21 was on the , er , ball , then , when he shot his now iconic " bubble " series for the @entity24			1
the series is widely credited for launching the trend of bold , artistic visions within fashion photography			1
the bubble first takes off in color from beyond the @entity33 skyline , then lands on the @entity34 in @entity3 , where it begins a surreal black - and - white tour of @entity3 streets , alleys , and cafes			1
designer clothes are on display in each shot , something that 's easily overlooked as model @entity44 cavorts in the plexiglass sphere , drawing a lot of attention ( and even a few fireballs ) from standers by			1
some of the clothes , particularly shoes , were damaged not by fire but by accidental dunks in the water when the bubble dipped a little too low			2
the top - flight ' 60s couture , an aesthetic whose appeal also has carried into the modern day , keeps the pictures otherworldly and stylish in equal measure			0
the sphere is held together by a ring of aluminum and suspended by a 1/8th inch steel cable attached to a crane			1
that cable often is squarely in the shot but is occasionally positioned or illuminated so it remains unseen			2
in some cases , it was removed from the frame by hand , creating the illusion of a levitating sphere			0
@entity21 insists a negligible amount of retouching was involved , and it obviously was not digitally manipulated			2
he points out that at 15 to 20 feet , such a thin cable becomes essentially invisible to the camera			0

the vision was inspired by @entity90 by early @entity92 painter @entity91			0
the fully opened triptych includes depictions of people in transparent spheres suspended among a ( mostly ) heavenly world			0
when closed , it shows the earth encased in a vast glass globe			0

they were n't the last forward - looking images he produced either ; lips streaks from 1967 looks like it came straight out of 1987			0
@entity21 has a knack for playing with perceptions , which is clear in other work he 's renowned for , such as @entity119 chair and @entity120 , bazaar			2
it shows what appear to be tiny models climbing giant chairs			0
@entity21 points to an image 's composition , palette , overall concept , and the chemistry between photographer and model as the most important aspects of his craft			1
while he started his career as a fashion photographer , he had by the end of the ' 60s transitioned into making commercials and films alongside his photo work			2
he was also responsible for a number of innovations including a computerized zoom lens in 1972 that got nominated for an @entity144			0
a great interview with @entity21 further illuminates the methods of this self - taught photographer perpetually interested in making bold statements and expressing nuanced concepts			1
