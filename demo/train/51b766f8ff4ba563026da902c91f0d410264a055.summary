-- here 's the thing : blaming @entity2 is easy			1
in the wake of the terrible shooting at that congressional town hall meeting , it is simple to point to a rampant culture of easy gun access , intolerance , and anti-government fever and say , " sure , this man was unbalanced , but the wild winds of the @entity2 blew him over the edge			1
" just ask @entity15 @entity14 , who jumped into the fray with his reaction			0
" well , i think we 're the @entity21 , " he said , evoking his state 's storied history			2
" we have become the @entity22 for prejudice and bigotry			0
" since then @entity14 has been assailed on tv , radio , and the internet as a grief - blinded malcontent by some conservatives , and praised as a clearsighted analyst by some liberals -- both sides armed with broad generalizations about @entity2			1
but having lived out @entity35 for 10 years , i have a generalization of my own : pundits in the @entity38 often make pronouncements about the world beyond the @entity41 , when their on - the - ground experience with such places consists of campaign visits , speaking engagements , and skiing trips			2
in other words , they 're talking out of their @entity48 , if you know what i mean			0
so i thought i 'd look at some of the evidence to see if @entity2 really has become unmoored from the rest of us -- a rogue state in which the unthinkable not only happens , but may be a byproduct of social and political unrest run amok			1
in august 2009 , president @entity60 spoke in @entity61 , only to find a guy outside the hall making off with the headlines by showing up with a semiautomatic rifle slung over his shoulder			0
he said he was exercising his @entity69 rights			0
he picked the right place			0
@entity2 has some of the nation 's most lenient gun laws			1
you can buy , possess and carry a handgun there far more easily than in most places , and gun - control advocates were plenty worried long before these killings			1
as @entity80 from the @entity81 told me about the accused @entity2 shooter , @entity84 , " this individual broke no laws in purchasing the gun , broke no laws in carrying the gun , broke no laws in having an extended clip with 30 bullets in it			1
he did n't break a single law until he pulled the trigger ! " gun - rights advocates counter that other places which have pioneered much more restrictive laws , such as the @entity99 , still have higher violent crime rates			1
but the facts suggest that whatever problems @entity84 faced , @entity2 's laws made sure that getting a gun was not one of them			1
next , i looked at @entity2 's sociopolitical climate , which seems to be broadly accepted as one of the hottest in the country			1
among the flashpoints : cuts for @entity114 transplants , gov. @entity111 's bizarre election claim that headless bodies were being found in the desert , and the always entertaining adventures of hell - for - leather lawman sheriff @entity118			1
but the biggest one has been , and continues to be , illegal immigration			0
last year 's controversial immigration law spurred protests , angry denunciations , and nationwide calls for a boycott			2
but often overlooked amid the noise : polls found that a tremendous number of @entity131 all over agreed with the state 's actions			1
and for anyone who wants to paint @entity2 as the poster child for intolerance , this is worth noting : the @entity138 reports that there were 274 hate crimes in @entity2 in 2009			1
that 's pretty robust , but on a per capita basis , the state of @entity143 had about the same , and @entity145 was considerably worse			2
the @entity146 says @entity2 has 10 active @entity148 groups embracing extreme anti-government doctrines , and the @entity146 's @entity150 has found echoes of @entity148 ideology in @entity84 's rambling writings			1
" the relationship is indirect , and it is filtered through a mind that is not right , " @entity150 tells me , but it is there			0
so is @entity2 's murky right - wing counterculture partially to blame for the shootings ? " it does n't seem unreasonable to look at something like this and consider its provenance , " @entity150 says			1
after all , the @entity165 bomber , @entity164 , believed his attack would spur a popular uprising against the government and that an army of fellow travelers was waiting in the wings ; and he did much of his planning while living in @entity2			2
the problem is almost half the states , according to the @entity146 's website , have as many or more @entity148 groups , which would mean if we are going to connect these dots , that those states too are potential hotbeds in which violent , maybe mentally ill extremists could grow			1
for example , @entity182 has 17 @entity148 groups ; @entity185 , 47 ; @entity186 , 52			2
we reached out to one of @entity2 's most well - known @entity148 groups , the @entity190 , which clearly portrays big government as an enemy and urges citizens to be prepared to defend their rights , their homes , whatever			1
its website is packed with military imagery			0
these groups , in my experience , are notoriously media - shy and difficult to reach			2
and yet within minutes of my request for their views on the shooting , they sent this response : " it makes your heart hurt for the entire country			0
this just keeps happening over and over again			0
the one common denominator seems to be that most of the shooters are mentally ill , but driven by current events			0
we do n't have any answer either			0
we 're just trying to do what we can to protect our country and our borders			0
" i suspect how people react to that message would tell me as much about the reader as it would about the writer			0
and maybe that 's the whole point			0
the facts suggest that @entity2 does have difficulties ; certainly , it is near the upper end of states around which furious social and political debates are swirling			1
it is not unfair to consider that some of the language , actions , and laws connected to those debates can combine with a violent , deranged mind to produce awful consequences			0
but @entity2 is far from alone			2
if the shots had been heard in any number of other states , we might also hear the same innuendoes that are now being sneered at @entity2			1
the viciousness of our public debates , the dirtiness of our politics , the anger of our people are not confined to one town , one state , or one region			0
only the degrees are different			0
how you see the facts on @entity2 depends on how you come at them			2
as i said : blaming @entity2 is easy			2
but almost 7 million @entity131 live there , and all we know for certain is that one of them did something terribly wrong .			0

some blame @entity2 's culture for shootings , @entity266 writes , but is that realistic ?
@entity2 has very lenient gun laws , but places with stricter laws have higher crime rates
@entity2 's rates of hate crimes , extremist groups are comparable to other states
anger , vicious political debate are found everywhere , @entity266 says
