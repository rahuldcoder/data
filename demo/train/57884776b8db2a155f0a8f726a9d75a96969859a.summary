@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 shocked the political establishment last week with her victory in the @entity8 @entity7 primary in @entity9 against rep. @entity10			1
like most @entity12 activists , @entity3 has embraced the @entity14 rhetoric that has been popular among congressional candidates in the current political climate			1
she and other conservatives have criticized fellow @entity8 , like @entity10 , for having become too comfortable in the nation 's capital , too willing to work through the normal political process and to compromise on core principles			1
" the people of @entity9 have spoken			0
no more politics as usual , " she said upon declaring victory			0
this kind of anti-washington rhetoric usually works well on the campaign trail , but it tends to vanish once a candidate is elected and starts the new job			1
ever since @entity31 and @entity32 shook public confidence in our government institutions , many @entity30 and @entity8 have defined themselves in opposition to the very job that they hope to win			0
in most of these cases , they have then abandoned their own ideals after being confronted with the realities of governing			1
most recently , @entity43 won the presidency with a campaign that emphasized change and rejected a political system that he said was broken			1
during the @entity30 primaries , @entity43 had differentiated himself from sen. @entity49 by blasting her for an " @entity51 " mentality , depicting her as someone who , like her husband , was too willing to cut deals and too cozy with the interest groups that lurk on @entity56			1
yet president @entity43 dropped most of his reform agenda soon after entering office			1
when pushing for signature legislation such as health care and financial regulation , the administration and @entity63 cut deals with the interest groups he once derided			0
democrats and @entity8 have continued to scramble for private dollars to fund their campaigns			0
the political process looks very much the same in 2010 as it did in 2008			1
the @entity8 freshmen who took control of @entity63 in 1994 with similar promises also came to adapt to the ways of @entity75			1
after the shutdown of the federal government that resulted from the budget standoff with president @entity80 , many of the freshmen tempered their outlook as they compromised on issues such as @entity83			1
they also mastered the parliamentary procedures they once decried and developed ties with interest groups to advance their agenda			0
by 2006 , the @entity8 , who in their " @entity88 " had promised to " transform the way @entity63 works , " looked very much like the establishment			2
the political process is more than a backdrop to decision - making			2
the process constrains what politicians can and ca n't do			2
for example , the fact that the campaigns are financed with private money ensures that lobbyists and interest groups wield influence			0
unless @entity63 passes government reforms such as publicly financed elections to change that process , @entity12 politicians will either have to deal with it or languish			2
furthermore , the separation of power and the nature of the legislative process require compromise to achieve legislation			2
it is misguided to condemn politicians for practicing a quintessentially @entity116 political art. the president and @entity63 must agree on legislation , other than rare moments when there is a super-majority to override a veto			1
the internally fragmented @entity123 and @entity7 must also reach agreement through a deliberative process filled with procedural traps such as the filibuster			0
a @entity12 @entity8 can complain all he or she wants about compromise , but on @entity132 , a new member of @entity63 is unlikely to get anything done without cutting a deal			2
finally , voters in both red and blue states depend on federal spending			0
although @entity12 candidates castigate earmarks , government spending and pork barrel politics , all of those who are victorious will represent constituencies profoundly affected by the money that @entity63 allocates every year			2
in @entity147 , the political birthplace of @entity148 and the scene of another recent @entity12 victory , the state has depended on federal dollars for jobs and infrastructure			0
indeed , the @entity155 and @entity156 states , which have been the home to the conservative movement since the 1970s , have depended on military contracts since the @entity160 as a pillar of their economy			0
voters should be extremely skeptical about the kinds of promises that candidates such as @entity3 are making			1
they have seen this movie before , and they know how it ends			0
in the end , voters should pay less attention to the @entity14 rhetoric and take a closer look at the specific policies that these candidates hope to pursue			0
doing so will allow voters to make a more realistic assessment of what their victories would mean for the nation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

@entity184 says anti- @entity186 candidates promise to change the ways of the capital
he says president @entity43 did n't deliver the political reform he promised
*republicans* elected in 1994 also abandoned anti-washington promises , he says
@entity182 : getting things done in @entity75 requires compromise
