-- this weekend , @entity9 's " @entity8 " gives @entity0 viewers an inside and in - depth look at the issue of firearms -- as viewed from behind the counter of a gun store			2
here are five things to know about the debate : 1 -- there is no debate about the impact of gun violence			1
in 2010 , the @entity16 tallied more than 31,000 firearm deaths in the @entity18			0
each year , some 55,000 violent deaths occur in the country , costing $ 60 billion in medical care and lost productivity , according to the agency			0
more than 38,000 people in the country are suicides			0
but , more than six months after 20 children and six adults were killed in @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , legislative efforts to stem the impact of gun violence have failed to gain traction			1
" at this point , nothing is different , " said dr. @entity35 , a policy analyst at the @entity36 in @entity37 who has witnessed the power of firearms as a hunter and gun owner and as an emergency room doctor			2
" the public 's attention has moved on			0
" 2 -- much of what we know is outdated			0
that 's because , in 1996 , pressure from the @entity51 led @entity52 to cut $ 2.6 million from the budget of the federal @entity16 's @entity54 that had been devoted to finding out what works			1
to underscore its point , @entity52 -- in a move led by @entity60 , a former gun - rights advocate and @entity63 legislator from @entity64 -- added this language to the agency 's appropriation : " none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the @entity16 may be used to advocate or promote gun control			2
" @entity52 added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the @entity16 to all agencies of the @entity75 after a @entity77 study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed			2
today , 17 years after the @entity16 restrictions were put in place , the @entity51 maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary			1
" what works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do n't have access to firearms , " the @entity51 's director of public affairs , @entity88 , told @entity0 early this year			1
" not to carry out more studies			0
" 3 -- but more studies may be in the cards			0
the @entity101 administration has signaled it wants to resume such efforts			1
this month , the @entity103 and the @entity104 laid out priorities for a research agenda to help policymakers better understand the causes and impact of gun violence and how to reduce it			1
the report says progress can be made in three to five years through research into the characteristics of gun violence , risk and protective factors , prevention and other interventions , gun safety technology , and the influence of video games and other media			1
the report came after president @entity101 ordered in january that federal agencies -- including the @entity16 -- identify the most pressing firearm - related violence research needs and signaled that he wanted to devote $ 10 million per year to the task			1
how successful will it be ? " it 's too early to tell , " according to @entity35			0
but he worried in a telephone interview that the matter could wind up as a tug of war between @entity16 and legislators in the @entity136 , who are responsible for passing -- or not passing -- appropriations			0
" you can see the most highly respected public health institution in the world turn into a rag doll between a determined administration and the equally determined @entity136 " majority , he said			0
" i 'm just hoping that research will be restarted , " he said			2
" surely we can agree that having a better understanding of effective strategies to reduce gun violence is a worthwhile goal that everybody ought to be able to agree on			1
" off the radar of the gun debate , which has focused on assault weapons bans and background checks , has been the fact that community - level strategies have already been shown to lower gang violence in a number of cities , he said			1
rather than racing after every 911 call , it makes sense to break the chain of events -- such as illegal gun trafficking , illegal acquisition and illegal carrying -- that often lead to the next 911 call , he said			2
focusing police efforts on the highest - risk people and places works , he said			0
between 1997 and 2007 , " @entity173 put that strategy in place and , over a decade , had a 50 % reduction in homicides			0
" 4 -- if you choose to own a gun , do it responsibly			2
whatever one thinks about gun control , anyone who opts to own a gun should store it responsibly			2
incidents in which a family member is killed or injured by a gun in the home far outnumber the times when a gun is used to injure or kill an intruder in self - defense , @entity35 said			0
" what people must understand is that the gun that is kept loaded and readily available for protection is also readily available to a curious child , to a depressed or upset teen , an angry spouse or a depressed grandparent			1
" 5 -- reasons for owning a gun have changed			0
a national survey published in march by the @entity203 reported that nearly half ( 48 % ) of gun owners say the main reason they own a gun is for protection , up from 26 % who gave that answer in 1999			1
less than a third ( 32 % ) cited hunting as the main reason , down from nearly half ( 49 % ) in 1999			1
the findings make no sense , since violent crime in the country overall has dropped by 48 % since 1993 , according to @entity35			0
perhaps even more important -- and less understood -- is the evidence that the benefits of keeping a gun for protection are far outweighed by the risks , he said			1
but those studies are more than 17 years old and out of date , which is why , he said , new research is needed .			0

@entity101 is seeking to fund work into how to stop gun violence
the @entity51 says such research is not necessary
for the first time , protection *outranks* hunting as a reason to own guns
