-- all hail to the king and queen -- of catfish			0
@entity5 of @entity6 , @entity7 , and girlfriend @entity8 of @entity9 , @entity7 , on tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the @entity15			1
the monster blue catfish weighed in at 130 pounds and was 45 inches in girth and 57 inches long , @entity16 , a spokesman for the @entity17 , said tuesday			1
" it has n't hit me yet			1
... i 'm still in shock , " @entity5 said tuesday			2
@entity5 , 47 , said he was about to call it a day when he decided to give it one last shot			0
" we threw the rod in , and about 30 minutes later , that rod took off , " he said			0
" i just put the pressure on him and tried to work him up towards the surface			0
his head broke the water and man , that was it , i knew i had a record breaker , " @entity5 said			2
@entity36 , who keeps a state - certified scale at his feed store in @entity39 , was notified tuesday morning by the @entity17 that a couple may have caught a state record catfish and they needed to use his scale to get an official weight			1
" my scale is inspected every year , it 's certified by the state , " said @entity36			0
before the catfish was put on the scale , @entity8 said it had to at least weigh more than 120 pounds , because it weighed more than the generator @entity5 kept in the back of his truck			2
" him and his girlfriend were jumping up and down because when it went over 100 pounds , they knew they had a state record , but when it went up to 130 pounds , they was really excited , " said @entity36			2
" he 'll be considered royalty in the fishing world			1
" although several official witnesses were on site when the scale read 130 pounds , the @entity66 and fish association still has to sign off on whether a world record has been broken			1
@entity69 of @entity70 , @entity7 , holds the official world record			1
he reeled in a 124 - pound catfish in may 2005 , in the same general area of the @entity15 , according to @entity16			1
and for those of you curious about the so - called honey hole where @entity5 caught this monster fish ? sorry , he is n't talking			2
" back in 1995 , i caught the @entity79 state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds , " said @entity5			1
after that , he said , everybody knew who he was and started tracking his every move			0
" i had to cut the running lights on my boat one time because i had boats following me			0
" @entity16 says @entity5 's keeping quiet about the exact location is understandable , but he expects to see more people fishing the general area along the @entity15 for their dream catch			2
@entity5 is keeping the catfish , for the time being , in a friend 's deep freezer			0
" i 'd like to see if one of the stores is interested in making a replication of it , like @entity100 or @entity101 's , " said @entity5			0
meanwhile , he 's catching up on sleep and hopes to celebrate soon with a couple of cold beers			0
" i 've been fishing for the monster my whole life ... by chance , he came by to my hook and i actually got him			0
i was just lucky , but i 'm not going to argue with it , that 's a world record , " @entity5 said .			1

the 130 - pound blue catfish beats the world record by 6 pounds , an official says
" it has n't hit me yet , i 'm still in shock , " *fisherman* @entity5 says
only some *paperwork* stands in the way of an official world record
" he 'll be considered royalty in the fishing world , " store manager says
