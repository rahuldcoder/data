-- @entity2 parents who are raising questions about the city 's plan to expand its pilot program of dispensing contraception , including the morning - after pill , to high school students are doing what parents should do			1
if they seek information from credible sources , they will learn that when taken within five days of intercourse , the morning - after pill @entity16 , which contains one of the hormones found in regular pills , is safe and effective			1
they also will learn that other forms of contraception have been available in many @entity2 public high schools for years			1
this new plan , open to all , is actually designed for girls who have been hardest to reach			0
these young women , from poor and working - poor families , are much more likely than others to get pregnant by accident			2
then , one of two things happens : a girl gets an abortion , or she has a baby she can not support			0
neither @entity2 's school authorities , nor mayor @entity37 , finds those options desirable ; both are quite rightly supporting the expansion			2
according to @entity43 of the @entity44 , about 40 % of school - based health centers in the @entity42 are allowed by their school districts to dispense contraception			1
sixty percent of centers are prohibited from doing so			0
requirements for parental consent vary			0
@entity2 's effort to reduce teen pregnancies appears to be among the largest and most comprehensive			1
what hangs some people up is the school administration 's decision , during the recent pilot phase of the project , to allow parents to opt their children out of it			0
parents received letters in the mail describing the program and telling them that their child would be in the program unless a parent disallowed it in writing			2
only 1 % to 2 % of parents denied permission			0
it 's a good bet many parents did n't read the letters , or if they did , thought their daughter was n't having sex , or were n't sure how they felt -- so they did n't do anything			0
@entity2 schools ' plan b program draws critics , supporters the school system took their silence as an endorsement and moved to expand the program			1
i think i probably would have done the same thing			0
but opponents said a fairer way of judging parents ' attitudes would have been to require them to opt their children in if they wanted them in the program			0
they argued that that would require a student and parent to talk to each other about the student 's sexual activity -- a good thing			0
advocates for the city 's plan offered a credible response			0
they said that many students and parents would avoid such a discussion			0
absent parental approval , students who were already sexually active , or about to be , would be in the same boat as before : unable to easily acquire contraception after either consensual or nonconsensual sex			2
we live in one of the richest , most well - educated countries in the world , yet we have the highest teen birth rate of comparable countries			1
that is simply not right			0
yes , parents are children 's first teachers and moral guides , but they need assistance , which is what the @entity2 system is attempting to provide			2
no reliable scientific evidence shows that the availability of birth control encourages young people to start having sex earlier			1
and there is good evidence that the increased availability of birth control , as well as improved sex education , has lowered the teen pregnancy rate dramatically			1
according to data released this week by the @entity141 , the teen birth rate in 2011 -- about one birth for every 32 girls -- is the lowest it has been since the 1940s , when the center began to track childbearing			1
a lower teen pregnancy rate means a lower abortion rate			1
among the 7,000 girls ages 15 to17 who got pregnant last year in @entity2 , nine out of 10 pregnancies were unplanned , and almost two out of three resulted in abortions			1
for that reason alone , we should embrace @entity2 's efforts to make all forms of contraception accessible , as well as affordable and safe			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity157 .			2

@entity2 expands program to dispense birth control in high schools with morning - after pill
@entity164 : the @entity42 has the highest teen birth rate of comparable @entity167 countries
@entity157 : no evidence contraception encourages teens to start having sex earlier
@entity157 : birth control lowers teen pregnancy rate , which means fewer abortions
