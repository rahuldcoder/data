@entity5 has shown no proof the 26 - year - old was killed , other than a building laid to rubble and the claim that her body was inside			1
experts have questioned why no militants died in the collapsed building , if they were holding @entity4 there , or why -- if the building had just been crushed -- there was no smoke from smoldering debris			2
skeptics fear @entity5 may have long killed her and just waited for an opportunity to officially announce the death -- a suspicion that has been floated before when @entity5 uploaded slickly produced , odious videos of other victims ' killings			2
