-- the " extraordinary " rush to develop an @entity3 vaccine is moving forward apace , the lead researcher told @entity0 's @entity5 on tuesday , adding that the fast pace may engender ethical concerns about how it the vaccine is eventually implemented			1
" this is , frankly , extraordinary , " @entity9 of the @entity10 at @entity11 said			1
" we are trying to do in a few months something that might typically take 10 years			0
we 've had accelerated reviews of all our applications , regulatory and ethical approvals , and so on			0
" " and we 're now trying to proceed so quickly that if things go well , by the end of the year , this vaccine might actually be being used in the three affected countries in @entity23			2
" he said that the vaccine has been shown to be " really quite remarkably protective " in studies on monkeys at the @entity28 in the @entity29 ebola drugs are in the works researchers are under tremendous pressure to develop a vaccine , as over 3,400 people have died in @entity23 and a @entity38 nurse 's assistant was confirmed on monday to be the first person to have contracted the virus outside of @entity23			1
but even if researchers are able to make enough vaccine , and have data showing that it is safe for use in humans and produces good immune responses , @entity9 said that they will would not know that " it actually works			1
" " so we 're going to have to figure out a way of using the vaccine , and at the same time evaluating it			0
and there 's a great deal of discussion about how you might do that now			0
" @entity57 may lie ethical concerns			0
your @entity3 questions answered there is little worry , he said , about administering a vaccine to humans in a phase one trial , as he said will begin this week in @entity23			1
the issue is what you do after that			0
" once you 've shown safety in those individuals , do you go on to deploy the vaccine in a very large population -- ideally of health - care workers who are at greatest risk -- without knowing that the vaccine actually works ? " " or instead , do you wait several months -- maybe six months , maybe a year -- to prove absolutely that the vaccine has a certain efficacy and then start thinking about deploying it widely ? " " and if you wait that long , the epidemic might either be over , or the whole thing might be completely out of control			2
" tobacco plant may be key to @entity3 drugs " so that 's the challenge -- to figure out what the best thing to do , given those conflicting priorities as i 've described them			2

there is " extraordinary " rush to develop @entity3 vaccine , says *scientist* @entity9
@entity101 questions arise in regard to when widely distribute vaccine , says @entity9
hill : there are risks in rushing and risks in *delaying*
