@entity0 , @entity1 -- a former @entity5 student found dead in his dorm room of an apparent suicide , alongside weapons and a backpack of bombs , planned a larger attack , officials said monday			1
school spokesman @entity12 identified the student as 30 - year - old @entity13			1
he was at the university from fall 2010 through fall 2012 but was not enrolled for the spring semester and was in the process of being removed from the dorm room where he lived			2
" while the crime scene processing was under way in that room , we found some notes and some writings that indicated that this was a planned attack , " @entity5 police chief @entity19 told reporters			1
he said @entity13 's plan appeared to be set in motion as early as february , when weapons and ammunition purchases were made			1
@entity13 developed an outline for the attack , but that never came to fruition , thanks in part to the rapid response of law enforcement , @entity19 said			1
the chief told @entity2 's @entity39 that he believes @entity13 built the bombs himself , but authorities were still trying to figure out how @entity13 was going to carry out his plan and whom he was going to target			1
" it was n't exactly clear what the attack was going to consist of			2
however , he did have a time line of how he was getting ready and preparing and then in the end , he would just ' give them hell ' is the quote that he used , " @entity19 told @entity2			2
when police entered the dorm room , they found @entity13 dead from an apparent self - inflicted gunshot wound to the head , a handgun , an assault weapon , a couple hundred rounds of ammunition and four homemade bombs in a backpack			1
an @entity66 's bomb squad team examined the explosives and rendered them harmless			2
federal agents have joined the investigation , and the bombs were sent to an @entity72 lab to determine what materials were used			2
it all started around 12:20 a.m. , when a fire alarm went off at the @entity78 dormitory			1
@entity19 told @entity2 that @entity13 pulled the fire alarm , perhaps to draw many people out into the open			1
police believe that @entity13 then went to his room to pick up the weapons			1
there , he encountered one of his roommates , who told police that @entity13 pointed a weapon at him			1
the roommate ran into a bathroom and called 911			2
officers arrived within minutes to rescue the roommate			0
they found @entity13 's body in his bedroom			2
@entity19 said police are still investigating to find out " what made him tick , " but early indications were that @entity13 had very few friends and had anger issues			1
according to @entity12 , the school spokesman , @entity13 had never been seen by @entity5 counselors and had not had any student conduct issues			1
he had one prior contact with law enforcement -- a traffic arrest in 2006 -- the police chief said			1
the dorm , home to about 500 students , was evacuated			0
" the way they handled it was disappointing because it started as a fire alarm , " said dorm resident @entity109			1
" nobody said what was going on with a bomb and the shooting			0
so we were left in the dark			0
" @entity109 was among five dorm evacuees sitting together on a campus bench , some of them bundled up in a blanket , others still dressed in their pajamas			0
another student dorm resident , @entity126 , said they received a text from authorities warning about a " suspicious death in @entity130			2
" " it 's really horrible that someone had to die , " said @entity131			0
" it just makes me feel more unsafe			0
" the university said it was providing food and counseling for the evacuated students at its veterans @entity139			0
@entity78 1 reopened later monday			0
firearms are prohibited at @entity5 , which is home to about 59,000 students at its main @entity0 campus and 10 regional facilities			0
as the evacuated students waited for hours to return to their building , worst - case scenarios raced through their heads			0
" he was just above us , " @entity126 said			0
" what if the roof caved in because a bomb went off and everyone in the building got hurt ? that 's just the crazy part			0
" @entity159 reported from @entity0			0
@entity160 reported and wrote from @entity161			0
@entity2 's @entity162 also contributed to this report .			0
