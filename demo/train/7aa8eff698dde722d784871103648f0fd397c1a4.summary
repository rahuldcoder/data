-- the @entity1 has begun a preliminary inquiry into allegations by the @entity4 that @entity6 staffers obtained unauthorized access to classified documents related to the agency 's now - defunct post- 9/11 interrogation program , according to people familiar with the matter			1
the @entity4 's charges , made in criminal referrals to the @entity15 , are in contrast to @entity19 chairman @entity18 's accusations last week that the agency spied on computers used by committee staffers at a @entity4 facility to investigate the @entity25 - era interrogation program			1
the committee staff has produced a 6,300 - page report on the program , which critics say violated prohibitions on torture and exceeded legal guidance from the @entity15			2
but the report remains in limbo , awaiting a declassification review by the @entity4 , which has disputed some of @entity6 findings			1
the unusual dispute has raised tensions between the agency and lawmakers charged with overseeing the agency 's activities			0
@entity18 is usually one of the intelligence community 's staunchest allies in @entity46			0
@entity15 officials have tried to avoid getting drawn into the fight , and some lawmakers have questioned whether it is appropriate for @entity51 , as an agency in the executive branch , to probe a dispute between legislators and another agency			0
the @entity1 's preliminary inquiry is intended to determine whether a full - fledged investigation is warranted , people familiar with the matter said			1
@entity60 first reported the @entity1 inquiry			0
@entity4 director @entity62 has disputed @entity18 's accusations			2
speaking at the @entity64 last week , he said " when the facts come out on this , i think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong			0
" documents that prompted the dispute relate to an internal review by former cia director @entity77 and , according to the agency , were intended to help summarize material it was providing to the committee			2
the documents were plainly labeled as for internal use and were not supposed to be reviewed by the committee			0
@entity18 said @entity6 staffers found the documents in the course of their work that were put in the computer system either on purpose by a whistleblower or perhaps in error , and that they corroborated some of the committee 's findings that the agency now says it disagrees with			1
she said committee staff routinely sees such documents and did n't violate any classified restrictions			0
@entity100 , a @entity4 spokesman , said in an op - ed published in @entity101 that the agency acted properly after it discovered @entity6 staffers may have accessed and retained sensitive documents stored in a @entity4 computer network			1
" these documents were privileged , deliberative , pre-decisional executive branch material that implicated separation of powers concerns , " @entity100 wrote			0
" because we were concerned that there may have been a breach or vulnerability in the @entity4 local area network on which @entity4 stored these documents , @entity4 information technology specialists were asked to conduct a limited review to determine whether these files were located on the side of the @entity4 network the committee was authorized to use			2
that review appeared to confirm the committee 's unauthorized access to the documents			1

preliminary inquiry over @entity4 allegations @entity6 staffers obtained unauthorized access to documents
@entity6 committee chair , in turn , accused @entity4 of spying on panel 's computers
@entity19 was reviewing @entity4 documents for report on interrogation program
