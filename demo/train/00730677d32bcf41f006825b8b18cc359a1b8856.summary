@entity0 , @entity1 -- wednesday broke in @entity1 with news of a new blaze at the damaged nuclear plant that crews have struggled to control since last week 's devastating earthquake and tsunami , adding to radiation fears in a country racing to avoid a full - on nuclear crisis			1
the fire was discovered wednesday morning in the northwestern corner of the no. 4 reactor building at the @entity16 plant , an official with @entity18 told reporters			1
it was the latest setback for a country struggling to dig its way out of the wreckage wrought by last week 's earthquake and tsunami			2
at least 3,676 people have died , the @entity26 said wednesday morning			2
another 7,558 people are missing and 1,990 were injured , it said			1
@entity31 - shocked survivors huddled in cramped shelters , grieved over lost loved ones and worried about relatives who are missing across villages and towns inundated by the tsunami waves spawned by friday 's 9.0 - magnitude quake off the east coast of @entity40			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity41 has called the disaster the country 's worst crisis since @entity45 , and one firm says that the earthquake and tsunami are likely to surpass @entity49 as the most expensive disaster in history			1
stocks in @entity1 opened higher wednesday morning , one day after the nation 's main market index suffered one of its biggest drops on record			2
tuesday , the @entity59 economic powerhouse reeled as stocks plummeted , sending shock waves through global markets			1
" the scale of this event has taken everyone by surprise , " said @entity63 , a @entity64 spokesman			2
" it 's stretched resources to the max. " the latest fire at the @entity16 nuclear plant in northeastern @entity1 comes one day after another fire there and an explosion at the plant 's no. 2 reactor			1
radiation level readings spiked at the building gate during the first fire but went down after the blaze was extinguished			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity83 said amounts returned to a level that would not cause " harm to human health			2
" radiation levels in @entity89 were twice the usual level tuesday , but they were too negligible to pose a health threat , officials said			1
but @entity1 authorities could not rule out the possibility of a meltdown at the troubled reactors			2
while sea water was being pumped into the reactors in an effort to prevent further damage , " it can not necessarily be called a stable situation , " @entity83 had said tuesday			1
a meltdown occurs when nuclear fuel rods can not be cooled , thus melting the reactor core and causing a release of radioactivity			1
in the worst - case scenario , the fuel can spill out of the containment unit and spread toxic radioactivity through the air and water			2
that , public health officials say , can cause both immediate and long - term health problems , including radiation poisoning and cancer			1
the plant 's owners have taken precautions to protect the people in @entity121 , where the reactors sit			1
the plant is about 138 miles ( 225 kilometers ) from @entity89			1
they evacuated all but about 50 workers from the facility and urged people within 18.6 miles ( 30 kilometers ) of the plant to remain indoors			1
the government imposed a no - fly zone over the 30 - kilometer radius " because of detected radiation after explosions " there , the country 's transportation ministry said			1
@entity83 said analysts also have their eyes on reactors no. 5 and 6 at the plant , where cooling systems were n't functioning well , though the temperature had dropped slightly tuesday			1
concerns about hot radioactive fuel boiling off cooling water and catching on fire continued into wednesday , with plant operators and government officials considering a plan to use helicopters to drop water into the cooling pond through the damaged roof of the reactor building , according to a @entity156 report			1
for many across @entity1 , calming jittery nerves is becoming increasingly difficult as the situation at the damaged facility looks increasingly dire			2
" i think , from a sanity standpoint , i 'm trying to side with the cool - headed point of view because i do n't want to think about the possibly of a full - blown meltdown , " said @entity162 resident @entity161			0
" so far , the winds are blowing north - northeast , so if a lot of radiation leaks , @entity89 should n't get a lot of the exposure , " said @entity167 , who lives in suburban @entity89			1
" of course , if the winds change , that 's a different story			0
we 've been advised to wear long sleeves , a cap , a surgical mask to reduce the amount of exposure -- that is , cover as much skin as possible			0
" across the country , emergency workers from @entity1 , foreign governments and international aid groups continued to scour tangled and displaced piles of debris , searching for survivors			0
ninety - one countries and regions and six international organizations have offered assistance , according to the @entity1 foreign affairs ministry			0
public broadcaster @entity194 reported that 450,000 people were living in shelters , and many schools had turned into emergency shelters			0
in the area of @entity0 , the capital of @entity201 , several tractor - trailers with cars on top had flipped over			0
personal belongings -- a child 's doll , an empty shoe , wedding photos covered in mud -- lay in heaps where houses once stood			0
cold weather has increased the hardship for disaster victims and rescuers			1
rescuers report that some victims have been exposed to cold weather and water , in some cases for days			0
conditions are expected to worsen , with temperatures forecast to drop below freezing by wednesday across portions of the earthquake zone , accompanied by snow , heavy rain and the threat of mudslides			0
already in @entity0 , cold rain and sleet fell on the decimated city tuesday , and snow fell in parts of northeastern @entity1			1
rescue work is also being complicated by the hundreds of aftershocks that have rocked @entity1 since friday 's quake			0
the @entity238 reported tuesday at least three quakes with magnitudes of 6.0 or greater , and more than a dozen others greater than 5.0 or greater			2
experts predict that the earthquake and tsunami will rank among the costliest natural disasters on record			0
@entity247 , senior vice president of research and modeling for @entity250 , said it is clear that the total losses will " be far greater than we experienced in @entity49			0
" that 2005 hurricane , which devastated @entity255 and the @entity257 @entity256 , had estimated losses of $ 125 billion , according to the @entity259			0
while agencies are working to raise money , donations have been slow to come			0
the @entity263 , a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations , says donations to nonprofit organizations have reached about $ 25 million so far			0
the total is far below the first four - day totals of other recent natural disasters , including @entity49 and the crisis in @entity271 , it said			0
wide - scale economic problems also loom			0
@entity1 stocks closed down 10.55 % tuesday , the third steepest percentage fall in the @entity276 's history			1
that was on top of a 6.2 % drop monday , the first full trading day after the quake			0
wednesday , the nikkei 225 index , the most prominent measure of @entity89 market stocks , rose 520 points , or 6 % , shortly after the market opened			0
all three of the major @entity257 stock indexes closed down about 1.2 % tuesday , after plunging much deeper earlier in the day on fears of the @entity1 economic downturn			2
friday 's quake was the strongest in recorded history to hit @entity1 , according to @entity238 records that date to 1900			2
the @entity238 revised the magnitude of the quake from 8.9 to 9.0 on monday			0
@entity2 's @entity295 , @entity296 , @entity297 , @entity298 , @entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 contributed to this report .			0
