on may 16 last year , a 22 - year - old @entity0 named @entity1 was being questioned by police in @entity3			0
he had recently returned from @entity4 via @entity5 , @entity6 , and then traveled overland to @entity8			1
his interrogators were surprised to find that hidden in his underpants were a digital storage device and memory cards			0
buried inside them was a pornographic video called " @entity17 " -- and a file marked " @entity19			2
" several weeks later , after laborious efforts to crack a password and software to make the file almost invisible , @entity8 investigators discovered encoded inside the actual video a treasure trove of intelligence -- more than 100 @entity29 documents that included an inside track on some of the terror group 's most audacious plots and a road map for future operations			1
future plots include the idea of seizing cruise ships and carrying out attacks in @entity39 similar to the gun attacks by @entity4 militants that paralyzed the @entity44 city of @entity45 in november 2008			1
ten gunmen killed 164 people in that three - day rampage			0
terrorist training manuals in pdf format in @entity8 , @entity51 and @entity52 were among the documents , too , according to intelligence sources			1
more : details revealed on @entity57 bombings liquid bomb plot origins @entity61 intelligence sources tell @entity62 that the documents uncovered are " pure gold ; " one source says that they are the most important haul of @entity29 materials in the last year , besides those found when @entity69 raided @entity71 's compound in @entity72 , @entity4 , a year ago and killed the @entity29 leader			1
one document was called " @entity75			0
" its authorship is unclear , but intelligence officials believe it came from @entity29 's inner core			1
it may have been the work of @entity81 , a senior @entity29 operative until his capture by @entity4 police in 2011			1
the document appears to have been the product of discussions to find new targets and methods of attack			0
@entity8 investigators believe it was written in 2009 -- and that it remains the template for @entity29 's plans			1
investigative journalist @entity95 , a reporter with the @entity8 newspaper @entity96 , was the first to report on the documents			1
one plan : to seize passenger ships			2
according to @entity95 , the writer " says that we could hijack a passenger ship and use it to pressurize the public			0
" @entity95 takes that to mean that the terrorists " would then start executing passengers on those ships and demand the release of particular prisoners			2
" the plan would include dressing passengers in orange jump suits , as if they were @entity29 prisoners at @entity113 , and then videotaping their execution			1
@entity1 and a man called @entity116 , who allegedly traveled back to @entity39 with him , are now on trial in @entity3 where they are pleading not guilty			0
@entity116 was detained in @entity119 two weeks after @entity1 's arrest			0
according to a senior western counterterrorism official , their names were on a watch list , and when they handed over documents at a @entity39 border crossing , their names registered with counterterrorism agencies			2
both men have pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges			0
@entity116 is also charged with helping to form a group called the @entity8 @entity132 , and is alleged to have made a video for the group threatening attacks in @entity8			1
prosecutors believe the pair met at a terrorist training camp in @entity4 's tribal territories and were sent back to @entity39 to recruit a network of suicide bombers			0
" we do not know what those men were up to but there are certain files of information that would make it plausible that they were probably thinking of a @entity45 - style attack , " says @entity95			0
in the fall of 2010 , a year after the document was written , @entity39 intelligence agencies were scrambling to investigate a @entity45 - style plot involving @entity8 and other @entity39 militants -- which sparked an unprecedented @entity155 travel warning for @entity61 in @entity39			1
" i think it is plausible to think that the ' @entity75 ' document is part of that particular project , " says @entity95			0
" @entity75 " suggests @entity29 was an organization under great pressure , without a major attack to its name in several years , harried by @entity164 intelligence			1
if anything , its predicament is even more dire today			0
" the document delivers very clearly the notion that @entity29 knows it is being followed very closely , " @entity95 tells @entity62			1
" it specifically says that @entity164 intelligence agencies have become very good at spoiling attacks , that they have to come up with new ways and better plotting			0
" part of the response , according to the document , should be to train @entity39 jihadists quickly and send them home -- rather than use them as fighters in @entity178 and @entity4 -- with instructions on how to keep in secret contact with their handlers			0
what emerges from the document is a twin - track strategy -- with the author apparently convinced that @entity29 needs low - cost , low - tech attacks ( perhaps such as the recent gun attacks in @entity190 carried out by @entity191 ) to keep security services preoccupied while it plans large - scale attacks on a scale similar to 9/11			1
those already under suspicion in @entity39 and elsewhere would be used as decoys , while others would prepare major attacks			0
that is yet to materialize , but @entity95 believes a complex gun attack in @entity39 is still on @entity29 's radar			2
" i believe that the general idea is still alive and i believe that as soon as @entity29 has the capacities to go after that scenario , they will immediately do it , " he says			2
while " @entity75 " does not include dates or places , nor specific plans , it appears to be a brainstorming exercise to seize the initiative -- and reinstate @entity29 on front pages around the world .			2

@entity8 officials discovered @entity29 documents encoded on porn video
@entity62 obtained access to details of the documents
many shed light on future plots the terror group had planned , including on cruise ships
