critics of the law are calling for economic boycotts of @entity6 , urging corporations and organizations to refrain from holding conventions in the state			1
they 're also pressuring @entity15 to take its 2011 all - star game elsewhere , much like the @entity17 did in 1993 when @entity6 refused to recognize @entity18 as a holiday			2
while @entity6 can ride out the backlash in the short term , the impact could hit hard later on , said @entity23 , assistant professor of management and organizations at @entity27 's @entity26			1
" the reputational consequences will have long - term economic consequences if it 's not resolved , " @entity23 said			1
critics have said the law will lead to racial profiling			2
supporters argue it will crack down on illegal immigration			0
latino rights groups , others call for @entity6 boycott as originally passed , the bill would have allowed police to ask anyone for proof of legal @entity45 residency based solely on an officer 's suspicion			1
@entity6 gov. @entity48 signed a bill to amend the law so that officers could check a person 's status only if the person had been detained or arrested for another reason			1
@entity48 said the changes should ease concerns about racial profiling , but opponents say the changes are not sufficient			0
days after the bill was signed into law , @entity61 , president and ceo of the @entity63 , said three conferences were canceled , including a gathering of the @entity68 scheduled for fall			0
@entity6 governor signs changes into immigration law now , the calls for boycotts are coming from across the country			1
the @entity75 approved a resolution calling on the @entity78 city to pull investments from @entity6			2
the @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity75 voted this week to boycott @entity6 businesses			2
@entity83 , mayor of @entity84 , @entity85 , banned city - funded travel to the state			2

in @entity6 , the @entity99 and @entity100 city councils voted this week to file suit against the immigration law			1

@entity48 has dismissed the notion that the state 's immigration law would hurt economic development , saying many businesses have long wanted tougher action			1
the law is slated to go into effect late this summer unless court challenges hold it up			0
what does the law do ? in an editorial on @entity143 , @entity48 said the recent boycotts and calls for @entity15 commissioner @entity146 to move next year 's all - star game are misguided			1
" put simply , history shows that boycotts backfire and harm innocent people			1
boycotts are just more politics and manipulation by out - of - state interests			2
as a border state , @entity6 has already paid a heavy price for the federal government 's failure -- hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars in unreimbursed costs -- and its citizens should not be punished further , " she wrote in the wednesday article			1
but @entity23 , the @entity27 professor , said history also has shown the opposite to be true			0
citing the @entity165 in the 1770s and the civil rights - era boycotts in the @entity169 , @entity23 noted , " those did not hurt the innocent , and they had real impact on political and social change			1
" a majority of @entity45 support @entity6 's law , even though most of them think it could lead to racial profiling , according to a recent national poll			1
a @entity181 / @entity180 survey released tuesday indicates that @entity45 overwhelmingly believe that the country 's immigration laws need to be changed			0
a @entity184 released last week showed similar public attitudes : nearly four in 10 @entity45 supported the law , with three in 10 opposed , and 31 percent saying they had not heard of the new law at the time , or had no opinion			0
while the boycotts are keeping the law in the spotlight , @entity23 predicted that even those apathetic about the issue could take a side			2
" even people who would n't have cared in the first place are now becoming aware of it and are starting to develop opinions about it			0
they may have been lukewarm or moderate in the beginning , but they are probably becoming polarized as they become more educated about the issue , " he said , noting that @entity200 ' opinion on the issue could change as well			0
" [ @entity48 's ] constituents will not be happy if @entity6 loses major business revenue like a @entity206 or an all - star game , " he said			1
" even if their own pocketbook is not being affected , they 're not going to want to be associated with that kind of negative press			0
" @entity48 is rejecting a request from a top @entity213 @entity212 to hold the immigration bill for one year to give @entity215 time to pass comprehensive immigration reform			1
in a letter dated thursday and obtained by @entity0 , sen. @entity218 , @entity220 - @entity219 , made the request to @entity48 , a @entity92			0
@entity218 , the @entity223 ' point man for immigration reform , called @entity6 's concerns about illegal immigration " legitimate security interests " and said he appreciates that @entity48 " felt duty - bound to take action to address the security concerns in your state			1
" " but i simply do not believe the remedy @entity6 has enacted will succeed in resolving the problem it is designed to address , " @entity218 wrote			0
he called the law , " wrong - hearted " and " likely unconstitutional			0
" he also asked @entity48 to call on @entity6 's two @entity92 senators - @entity235 and @entity236 - to " immediately begin discussions with me to enact " immigration reform			1
on friday , @entity48 's office informed @entity0 of the governor 's response			0
" the governor is certainly grateful that sen. @entity218 has focused some attention on @entity6 's border security plight , " said @entity242 , @entity48 's deputy chief of staff for communications			1
but , @entity242 continued , @entity48 " is waiting for action on border security			0
" attempting to highlight federal inaction on the matter , @entity242 referred to a letter sent from border state governors , including @entity48 , to @entity215 leaders in april 2009			2
it called for more @entity257 personnel to help local law enforcement agencies combat violence , crime and illegal immigration along the @entity45 - @entity112 border			2
