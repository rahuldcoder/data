-- president @entity1 has accomplished some extraordinary things but can he really shoot down a fighter jet ? the f - 22 raptor is the most expensive jet fighter ever built			1
the plane is the @entity4 , a supersonic stealth marvel that looks like it 's flown straight out of a @entity9 action film			0
it is being built for the @entity11 , boasting the most advanced technology in the sky			0
" you talk to any aviator in the world , ask what they would like to fly , and if they do n't say the @entity4 then they are lying , " @entity16 major @entity14 told the @entity18 magazine			1
" i would kill to fly it			0
" the @entity16 government has ordered nearly 200 of them , even as the price has rocketed to more than $ 350 million each , making the @entity31 / @entity30 the most expensive fighter ever built			1
but it 's never been used in combat and it 's not clear when it will be			0
the @entity16 simply does n't face any enemies with planes advanced enough to bother sending out an @entity30			2
" the reality is we are fighting two wars , in @entity40 and @entity41 , " defense secretary @entity42 said , " and the @entity4 has not performed a single mission in either theater			1
" @entity42 does n't want any more of them			2
@entity1 , who campaigned for the presidency criticizing what he considers wasteful military spending , does n't either			2
is the @entity4 essential military spending or a waste of money ? sound off below but it 's the @entity53 that actually funds the military			1
a lot of its members want to see more f - 22s taking off , to keep the @entity16 air force ahead of potential rivals and protect thousands of factory jobs across the country			2
" we need to maintain that air superiority , " said congressman @entity63 , whose district is home to the main @entity30 assembly line			0
" this is not just about 2,200 jobs , although with the economy as it is , and all these job losses , it 's kind of preposterous to think that this administration would close ( them ) down			0
" the @entity77 of the @entity78 has voted to order a dozen more planes			0
but the full @entity53 would still have to vote and @entity1 would have to sign the legislation			1
he says he will veto it instead			0
the president is taking aim at the @entity4 but the fighter jet probably wo n't go down without a fight .			1

@entity16 president @entity1 faces battle with @entity53 over new @entity4
@entity1 , defense secretary @entity42 do n't want any more of the $ 350m fighter jets
many in @entity53 see f - 22 as way of protecting defense *industry* jobs
@entity1 has *threatened* to veto legislation ordering more fighter jets
