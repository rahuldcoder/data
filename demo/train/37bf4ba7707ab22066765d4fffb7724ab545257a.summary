-- ten years after the end of its civil war , @entity4 , which is heading to the polls friday , has been transformed into a regional @entity7 power with a strong economy , but poverty is still widespread			1
@entity4 experienced double digit growth in gdp annually in the period 2002 - 2008			1
in the last five of these years , average annual growth was at 17 % , which more than doubled the size of the economy			2
the country is the second largest oil producer in @entity19 , and the third biggest economy , after @entity21 and @entity22			2
do these tremendous growth rates mean that @entity4 has escaped the so - called resource curse , where oil resources are detrimental to growth ? is @entity4 likely to continue growing at these fast rates , and perhaps catch up to the largest economies in the region in a few years ' time ? is @entity4 a success in terms of development and poverty reduction ? it is not uncommon for countries that come out of a civil war to grow at very high rates			1
the growth seen in the period 2002 - 2008 may thus reflect the end of the civil war in 2002			1
read related : post-war generation emerges as @entity4 votes if there is a tendency to blame all that is wrong in @entity4 on its war legacy , perhaps the end of the war should be credited for things that have been going well ? it is always problematic to speculate about future growth rates			1
after 2009 , growth has dropped to around 3 % per year and projections for the coming years are in the range 5 - 8 %			2
there are many reasons for this significant drop , the financial crisis and oil price development are part of the explanation			0
but in the longer perspective , there may be more fundamental structural challenges to @entity4 growth and development			1
in particular , research shows that resource - rich countries with little political accountability have trouble converting resources into development			1
@entity4 scores still low on governance indicators , and the coming elections seem unlikely to challenge the over 30 - year - long reign of president @entity74			1
watch : @entity4 's economic potential the fact the @entity4 economy is the most concentrated in @entity19 also makes growth vulnerable			2
the profitability of the oil sector renders diversification difficult in any economy			0
but is the @entity4 government really trying to diversify ? an important question is how government reliance on oil rents affects political incentives to diversify the economy			1
business environment indicators for the country remain poor , while investment is hampered by a lack of education and institutional challenges			1
do the poor care about the overall growth rate of the @entity4 economy ? experience shows that growth reduces poverty less in countries with high initial inequality			1
and oil - driven growth in a country with low political accountability is susceptible to wealth concentration rather than redistribution			1
employment in the oil sector is typically also too limited to produce widespread economic opportunities			0

the last real census in the country was conducted in 1970			0
the last figures on poverty are from 2000 , putting the proportion of people living on less than $ 1.25 a day at 54 %			0
@entity4 ranks as 148 out of 187 countries on the @entity125			2
based on a household sample , @entity126 estimated a poverty rate of 37 % in 2008			0
however , it is difficult to assess how the poverty line was constructed			0
as data is not directly comparable to previous studies , it is also problematic to analyze development over time			0
in spite of this , the president claims that the poverty rate has been reduced from 70 to 37 % from 2002 to 2008			0
a census is due to be held next year			0
interestingly , but perhaps not surprisingly , it takes place after the coming elections			0
some data of a more limited nature do provide a window onto the situation of the poor in @entity4			2
in 2010 , the @entity148 and the @entity149			0
@entity150 conducted a survey of microcredit clients in @entity153			0
results suggest that business profitability among the poor is constrained by a lack of education and health and by corruption			1
this indicates that the factors that restrain dynamism in non-oil segments of the @entity4 economy , also act as constraints on the very survival of the urban poor			2
without structural and political reforms of these constraints , it is hard to believe that an election in and of itself will change the lives of the poor			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 and @entity176 .			0
