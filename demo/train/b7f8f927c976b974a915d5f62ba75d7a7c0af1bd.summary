-- @entity1 may have to retire its title as the only democracy in the @entity4			1
with sunday 's free and fair national election , @entity5 joins the honor roll as one of the very few @entity10 democracies			1
other @entity4 countries hold elections too , of course			1
but those elections fall into two broad categories			2
the first category is the blatantly rigged : @entity17 , most spectacularly , but also @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 , among others			2
in the second category , elections are more or less honest -- but fail to exert much control over the actions of the government : @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29			2
in @entity5 , despite violence , votes are honestly counted			1
once counted , votes decide who rules			0
for all the country 's well - known problems , that record is a remarkable achievement			0
the brave @entity5 democrat @entity38 posted this firsthand account on his important blog , @entity41 : " i voted			1
it felt great , but the greatest thing about it was how normal it felt ; elections have become a ho - hum , commonplace occurrence			0
that 's quite a feat for a country with @entity5 's past and current challenges			1
the voting procedure itself was very well organized and speedy			0
the election site had seven polling stations , with about 400 registered voters allowed to vote there			2
everyone 's name was posted outside , along with information about what polling station they were supposed to use			0
once inside , ids were checked against name lists , and one had to sign next [ to ] one 's name to indicate that this name has voted			0
all in all , there are reasonable mechanisms in place to contain incidents of fraud			0
... " the @entity74 media is hyperventilating about mortars and katyushas			0
... this was a logistical failure for the jihadists ; hardly any successful suicide bombers or sniper attacks near the polling stations			0
lobbing mortars indiscriminately around @entity84 is bs intimidation			0
it certainly did n't deter voters			0
" the fact that the security authorities allowed vehicular traffic around 11 am was both surprising and bold			0
it showed confidence in their security precautions , and the fact that there were no car bombs shows that they were right			0
" @entity5 's elected government has consolidated power over the whole country , including the formerly @entity17 - run southern city of @entity103			1
it has presided over a remarkable decline in violence			0
the @entity108 's @entity5 index estimates that there were 34,500 @entity5 civilian casualties in 2006			1
in 2009 , 2,800 @entity5 civilians died violently			1
attacks on coalition forces have dwindled from almost 2,000 per week at the end of 2006 to a little over 100 per week			0
@entity5 is not yet a stable place -- but a future of stability seems at last at hand			1
maybe the surest sign of success is that those who once opposed the surge are now scrambling to grab credit for it			0
@entity5 " could be one of the great achievements of this administration , " boasted vice president @entity125 to @entity0 's @entity126 last month			1
next we 'll hear how we owe the @entity131 and the @entity132 to the @entity134 administration			0
well , that 's not how those who were there remember it			0
a stable @entity74 - oriented @entity5 at peace with itself and its neighbors would be a great prize			2
if that future does take hold , we 'll learn the answer to another great question			0
speaking on the eve of war in 2003 , president @entity146 told the guests at the @entity151 's annual dinner that he discerned " hopeful signs of a desire for freedom in the @entity4			1
@entity156 intellectuals have called on @entity156 governments to address the ' freedom gap ' so their peoples can fully share in the progress of our times			1
" leaders in the region speak of a new @entity156 charter that champions internal reform , greater politics participation , economic openness , and free trade			1
and from @entity28 to @entity170 and beyond , nations are taking genuine steps toward politics reform			0
a new regime in @entity5 would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region			1
" will he be vindicated ? in the january issue of the @entity181 , @entity179 offers grounds for hope that the answer may be yes			0
@entity179 , an expert on democracy - building who served with the @entity187 , itemizes the indicators of growing yearning for self - rule in the @entity4			1
he notes surveys in which 80 percent of @entity156 across the region agree that democracy is the best form of government and would be good for their own country			1
of all the obstacles to @entity156 democracy -- religion , culture , geopolitics -- the most important is geological : oil			1
oil states tend to be undemocratic states , because control of the state so directly translates into control of the nation 's wealth			2
when the price of oil rises , the value of power rises with it			2
it 's not a coincidence that oil states from @entity219 to @entity220 to @entity17 have turned to more repressive and hard - line policies since the price of oil began to rise in 2001			2
by contrast , the 1986 collapse in the price of oil is widely cited as a decisive factor in the collapse of the @entity229			2
@entity5 's future will depend on its success overcoming " the curse of oil			1
" @entity235 's next contribution to @entity4 democracy may be an energy policy that finally lifts this curse			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity5 held a free and fair election for *parliament* on sunday , says @entity241
he says @entity5 can be a model democracy for the @entity156 world
president @entity146 spoke of " hopeful signs of a desire for freedom " in the region
@entity255 : biggest obstacle to democracy in @entity4 is the *influence* of oil wealth
