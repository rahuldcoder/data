deal with @entity7 , following the @entity10 club 's takeover by an @entity12 group on monday			1
@entity5 @entity4 joins @entity1 for a @entity14 transfer record of £ 32.5 million			1
@entity15 had been leading the chase for @entity4 , who had insisted he wanted to play for the @entity18 club			1
however , @entity7 had stood firm in insisting that they did not want to sell 24 - year - old @entity4 and refused numerous @entity15 offers in recent weeks , putting an end to that deal			1
but @entity1 -- with new financial clout provided by their @entity24 - based owners -- met the valuation placed on @entity4 by the @entity27 giants , breaking the @entity14 transfer record			1
@entity4 told @entity1 's web site : " i knew that @entity1 is a very big club , there 's a great team there already and this is an exciting project			1
" i liked the project , and when @entity1 made the offer to @entity7 , i decided to come here			1
i liked the plans that @entity1 have and i want to succeed with them			2
" @entity4 confirmed the presence of his international team - mates @entity37 and @entity38 at @entity1 was a factor in his decision to sign , even though @entity15 appeared a more likely destination at the start of transfer deadline day			1
@entity44 , who had a playing spell in @entity27 with @entity46 , has spoken to his new signing and @entity4 is keen to work with the former @entity49 and @entity50 manager			2
" i met with the manager today and it went very well , " said @entity4			2
" i know that he was a great player and i think that will be a big help to me			0
i want to help the manager and the team to win the @entity10 , that 's my ambition here			2
" @entity1 also attempted to muscle in on arch - rivals @entity60 's acquisition of @entity63 striker @entity62			1
@entity63 accepted @entity1 's bid for @entity62 , but the @entity66 international opted to join the @entity10 champions			1
earlier in the day , @entity1 agreed to a takeover by the @entity70 business group , a deal that will end former @entity74 prime minister @entity73 's brief ownership of the @entity10 club			1
the @entity76 will now look at the club 's accounts and contracts before a takeover is officially completed			0
the group reached an agreement late on sunday night with @entity73 , said board member @entity83 , who brokered the deal			0

the club said in a statement that a " memorandum of understanding " has been signed and the deal is subject to a due diligence , allowing investors to request information from @entity1 and the @entity10			1
financial terms were not immediately available , but the @entity70 group described it as a " huge takeover " which gives the consortium " all the management rights			0
" @entity73 , who bought @entity1 last june , had his assets frozen and fled to @entity14 last month to escape corruption charges in @entity74 , claiming that he could not be assured of a fair trial			0
@entity83 -- chief executive of @entity12 - based developer @entity105 -- reached the deal with @entity73 and @entity108 , the legal chief of the @entity109			2
@entity83 said the group was attracted to the " richest @entity112 competition with more than $ 3 billion revenue			0
" like @entity73 , the new owners want manager @entity44 to deliver @entity116 qualification by breaking into the top four of the @entity10			0
after two wins in their first three matches of the season , @entity1 are third in the standings -- one point behind leaders @entity15			2
@entity83 said on tuesday that @entity44 would be given the financial clout to help him meet the aspirations of the new owners			0
he told @entity126 that he plans to meet @entity44 and talk over future transfer targets			0
" i will come to the @entity14 in a few days to meet the manager mark ( @entity44 ) , " he said			0
" we will sit down with him and see what it is he needs now			0
" confirming that the bid to sign @entity62 from @entity63 ahead of city rivals @entity60 was a serious one , he added : " that was genuine			1
