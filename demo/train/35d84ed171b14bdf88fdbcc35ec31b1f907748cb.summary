-- to understand how human nature sometimes does n't heed winter weather warnings , listen to how @entity3 did n't listen			1
she ventured into wednesday 's storm in @entity6 , rendering herself stuck in her car on a snowbound road -- even after the nation saw two weeks ago how @entity11 motorists were forced to sleep in their cars while stuck in another storm			1
such standstills frustrate officials who warn the public of deadly weather			2
they 're now studying ways to improve messaging , the @entity18 said			1
" you know , it was such a crazy thing , " @entity3 , who is pregnant , told @entity0			1
" we knew there was a huge front coming through , but you just never anticipate it coming as fast as it does			2
and it came in the middle of the day at lunchtime			2
" my impression was that i could get to where i was going and get back , like a lot of other people			2
and the fact that it came so fast , that 's the thing			2
it 's amazing how quickly you can get stuck , " she added			2
" all it takes is one accident , and then it just starts backing up , and it 's the trickle - down effect			2
" and here i am , ironically , stuck in it , " @entity3 said in a phone interview wednesday from her vehicle			1
she and her child were spending their fourth hour in the car , though it should have taken only 22 minutes to get home in @entity54			1
when officials see footage of such stranded drivers , they become distressed , said @entity59 , the @entity18 chief of fire and public weather services			1
weather warnings are often issued three or four days in advance of a storm so that people can prepare for their safety , @entity62 said			1
thwarting those efforts are public attitudes of " i 've been through this before or i 'll get through this , " he said			2
" in places that are n't used to receiving this type of weather like @entity80 and @entity6 , the images of people being on the road unable to move are very disturbing , " @entity62 said			1
" nobody wants to see that			2
" we 're issuing these watches , warning and advisories , and yet people go out into these storms , " @entity62 said			2
" we issue them so that people will listen to them and say , hey , there is something different going on than the average weather			2
" the agency is working with social scientists and researchers on possible ways to improve the public messages			1
their goal is to protect people and property			2
" one of the things that we 're studying is whether our messages are clear , " jacks said			0
" there is no single answer to this			0
it 's a topic that i think is important to study because we want to minimize ( distressing weather images ) you see on tv , so that people understand the threat and they react to the threat appropriately			0
" do n't put on your stupid hat @entity119 of @entity54 experienced frostbite on her ankles wednesday when she left work and drove home as snowfall began			1
but she moved only a mile in an hour and then did n't move at all two hours later , so she decided to walk the remaining four miles , she said			1
she became stranded in a hotel where she warmed up and discovered the apparent frostbite , she said			1
fortunately , a team of nurses were also finding refuge in the hotel , and they wrapped her ankles and elevated her feet			0
@entity119 acknowledged she heard of the weather warnings			1
" i was kind of hesitant to go , but figured i would leave as soon as it started , then make it back in time , " @entity119 said			1
" but once the snow came , in 45 minutes , everything was covered			0
traffic was bumper - to - bumper			0
" abandoned or snowbound vehicles in the @entity142 can hamper the travel of first responders and government trucks with snow plows , sand and salt , the @entity140 said thursday			0
there 's also the driving peril of fallen power lines , trees and branches as well as ice dropping from overpasses , the @entity149 added			0
that 's why transportation officials urge motorists to stay off the road during storms			0
widespread gridlock unfolded any way wednesday , inflaming @entity6 gov. @entity164 to tell residents bluntly not to be " stupid			1
" " more than anything else , we 're just encouraging people to be smart , and do n't put their stupid hat on during the next 48 hours , " @entity164 said , in reference to how special four - wheel vehicles were being dispatched to rescue motorists stranded on highways			1
officials and citizens alike often speak of how experience can go a long way in avoiding such calamities , but as the writer @entity179 put it , " experience teaches only the teachable			1
" the school of hard knocks @entity11 seemed teachable this week , as residents wisely stayed home and off the roads in the ongoing storm that has since moved north and is now pummeling @entity6 and @entity187			1
but @entity11 's response was learned the hard way after last month 's ice storm brought highway and local traffic to an eerie standstill , as if frozen in a snow globe			1
in all , that weather was blamed for 10 deaths in the @entity197 , five in @entity198 and the others in @entity6 and @entity200			1
in last month 's storm , @entity11 officials were excoriated for not acting promptly on early warnings			1
" i accept responsibility for the fact that we did not make preparation early enough to avoid these consequences , " gov. @entity204 said			0
" ... i 'm not looking for a scapegoat			0
i 'm the governor , the buck stops with me			1
" in this week 's storm , however , @entity11 's highways and byways were so empty that one @entity80 resident likened them to a sleeping beauty			2
meteorologist @entity218 , senior vice president of @entity219 , remarked how @entity220 this week avoided spending 22 hours stuck in their car as they did in last month 's storm			1
" with that wake - up call , people took the forecasts seriously this time , " @entity218 said in a @entity0 commentary			0
" schedules were adjusted and people worked from home			0
for days , meteorologists warned of widespread power failures			0
" heeding the warnings mitigated the effects of electricity loss wednesday to more than 729,000 customers in @entity235 , @entity6 , @entity11 and elsewhere in the @entity197 , @entity218 said			1
mayor blasted over opening schools as the front now hammers @entity187 with 14 inches of snow , controversy now roils there about whether the city should be holding school for its 1.1 million students -- especially when gov. @entity244 declared a state of emergency thursday for @entity187 , @entity246 and the @entity248 areas			0
mayor @entity249 acknowledged the criticism against opening the schools in a snowstorm , but he defended his decision			0
other school districts in the region kept students at home			0
" it 's always a tough decision based on imperfect information , " @entity249 told reporters thursday			0
he said the @entity18 reported as little as 3 inches of snow on the ground at the start of the school day , with warmer conditions than in previous storms			1
but meteorologist @entity268 of @entity270 's " today " show disagreed with the mayor 's characterization of the forecast , saying it was " on time and on the money			0
" " at the time , we thought our children would be able to get to school safely , " the mayor said			0
" there are a huge number of parents for whom the consistency of the school schedule is absolutely necessary			0
" they are going to work , they have no choice			0
if they ca n't get their kid to school , they do n't have another option			2
there are huge numbers of parents for whom their kid getting to school also means their child will have a good meal , and in some cases , two meals			0
and so , the fact is , it 's a very big deal to some parents , " @entity249 added			0
the city 's teachers union disagreed with him , citing safety concerns			0
" having students , parents and staff traveling in these conditions was unwarranted			0
it was a mistake to open schools today , " @entity312 , president of the @entity313 , said thursday .			0
