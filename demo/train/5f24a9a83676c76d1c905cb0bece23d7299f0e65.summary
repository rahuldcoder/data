@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 bounded out of the back of an ambulance ahead of most of the other volunteers			1
a bullhorn in his hand , he was , in a sense , the pied piper			2
" if there 's anybody out here , that wants the swine flu vaccine , please come over here , " he said			1
outside @entity0 's main library , a crowd started to build , and soon about a dozen homeless people were rolling up their shirt sleeves -- in the middle of the street -- for the @entity25 vaccination			1
" you stop spreading the germs , " @entity3 said			0
" because if a homeless person gets positive for the swine flu , they get sick , they go into a gas station and use the bathroom , transfer those germs to a public bathroom , [ then ] mom and dad come in with little ones , use that bathroom -- boom			1
" the volunteers are with the @entity44 -- a nonprofit homeless advocacy center that also runs a shelter in @entity47 , @entity1			1
they 've hit the streets for about three weeks to vaccinate the homeless population in @entity50			1
they requested the vaccine through the @entity1 @entity53 to help part of a population that the @entity56 calls an at risk group			1
many homeless people often have untreated medical conditions , and the lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for them to catch the virus			1
so far , the group has vaccinated about 300 homeless people " some have high blood pressure , some are alcoholics and are more susceptible to the flu , the seasonal flu , and the swine flu , " said dr. @entity66 , a family practice physician who is a volunteer			1
" we 're protecting them , and we 're also saving the emergency rooms here as well from being overloaded with potential patients , swine flu patients			2
" wearing a yellow reflective t - shirt , @entity66 spends his nights on the street during the vaccination effort			0
" i think it 's needed , " he said			0
" and believe it or not , it 's fun			0
that 's why i 'm a doctor			0
" @entity85 was one of the first people in line			0
he lives in the park next to the library in downtown @entity0			0
the volunteers took his temperature to make sure he was n't running a fever and took his name down so he could be entered into a @entity53 database			2
there 's not a whole lot of people that come by and do something like this , " @entity85 said			0
" i know people can die from [ the flu ]			0
" but on this night , not everyone was able to get the shot			2
@entity104 -- the only name he gave to volunteers -- was ready and willing but not able			1
@entity107 had gotten the best of him , and he could no longer stand			0
fearing a possible bad reaction to the vaccine , the volunteers would not give it to him			1
calmly , @entity3 leaned down to talk to @entity104 , who was sitting on the grass , and explained why they could n't vaccinate him then			0
" @entity104 , i 'm gon na put something in your bag			0
it 's a piece of paper , " @entity3 said			0
" when you wake up in the morning , promise me you 're going to look for this piece of paper , ok ? it says our phone number			2
call us in the morning			0
we 'll come back and give you a shot when you 're a little more sober			1
" @entity104 insisted , " i need the shot now			2
" @entity3 replied , " well , we do n't think tonight 's a good night because you have a lot of alcohol in you			0
" the volunteers , who travel with a police escort in case they encounter any situation they 're not equipped to handle , described the homeless as a forgotten population			1
he lost his trailer and his construction job in @entity137 , @entity1 , and headed south to @entity0 , he said			1
he 's been homeless for three weeks , and he 's trying to stay sober			2
" it 's tough out here , but it 's how you make it , " @entity134 said , rolling up his sleeve to get the vaccine injection			2
the volunteers said there 's no way to know how much of an effect they are having in stopping the spread of @entity25 , but they believe they are doing a public service			1
" a true blessing , " @entity134 agreed			1
" you do n't have to go to a hospital and pay the bill			0

volunteers hit streets to offer @entity25 vaccine to homeless in @entity50 , @entity1
they travel with a police escort to help with any situation they 're not ready to handle
lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for homeless to catch the virus .
" a true blessing , " says one of the men who received the shot
