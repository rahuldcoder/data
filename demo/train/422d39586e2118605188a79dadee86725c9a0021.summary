@entity0 -- to an outsider , thursday 's contest to elect the next mayor of @entity0 would appear to be a fight between two larger - than - life characters -- known best by their first names -- for control of the city 's famous red buses			1
among a wide field of candidates , only these two men have any realistic chance of taking a starring role at this summer 's @entity17 in @entity0 : @entity22 incumbent mayor @entity21 , 47 , and his 66 - year - old nemesis , @entity20 left - winger and former mayor @entity18			1
both men have devoted their energies to transport -- and attacking each other viciously on the issue , as well as on their complex personal tax arrangements			2
with his distinctive nasal south @entity0 accent , @entity18 rose to fame in the early 1980s as leader of the @entity34			2
@entity18 -- populist , socialist , environmentalist -- was one of the few who stood up to @entity38 , the @entity22 prime minister at the time , earning him the moniker " @entity18			2
" two decades later , @entity20 pm @entity40 recreated the long - dormant job of @entity0 mayor , but if he hoped a similar - minded centrist would win , the move backfired			1
@entity18 was a feisty @entity20 member of @entity45 , but when his party picked a blander , less troublesome candidate for mayor , he stood as an independent and cruised to victory			1
in revenge , he was expelled from @entity20 , though he was later brought back into the fold			2
one of his first , and most unpopular , acts was to scrap the much - loved but decrepit fleet of @entity55 double - decker buses , dating from the 1950s			2
he replaced them with the " bendy bus , " snake - like @entity59 vehicles that terrified road - users in the narrow streets			0
he also upgraded underground trains and brought in a controversial congestion tax on motorists entering central @entity0			0
@entity18 served two terms before he was beaten in 2008 by @entity21 , another maverick politician on the right of the political spectrum			1
the scruffy - haired @entity69 ex-journalist , who appears to have emerged straight from a @entity71 novel , inspired a cult following with spirited performances on a satirical @entity75 tv show that highlighted his blustering , easygoing charm			0
among @entity21 's pledges was to scrap the accordion - like bendy buses and replace them with a @entity80 - built @entity55 , which appeared on the streets this year			1
the buses are stylish -- echoing the hop - on , hop - off design of the tourists ' favorites -- but expensive : the first eight buses cost more than $ 18 million in total , although future buses will be $ 500,000 each			1
true to the bitter rivalry between the men , @entity18 has pledged to cancel orders for more routemasters in favor of hybrid vehicles if @entity96 vote him back into power , although he will allow the current eight buses to remain in service			1
" i 'm quite happy to have them running around @entity0 , " @entity18 told @entity101 newspaper last month			2
" we 'll put a thing on the side saying : ' the most expensive bus , thanks to @entity21			2
' " in response , a spokesman for @entity21 said : " @entity18 said that only some ghastly dehumanized moron would want to get rid of the @entity55 , then he scrapped it			1
" now he wants to cancel an order for one of the greenest buses , which costs , and he knows costs , no more than a hybrid bus			0
such a decision would put hundreds of @entity80 jobs at risk and would once again deprive @entity96 of the much - loved hop - on , hop - off service			1
mr. @entity18 simply ca n't be trusted			0
" there 's little love lost between the two candidates : at one point during the campaign , as both rivals accused each other of avoiding paying the full rate of income tax , @entity21 -- who was born in @entity124 to @entity80 parents -- accused @entity18 of being a " f * * * ing liar			1
" and while the rising cost of public transport is one of the key issues in the election , many analysts say the difference between the two men themselves will be the deciding factor for most of the city 's 5 million registered voters			1
" there 's a great deal riding on this election , but it 's really all about personalities , " said @entity146 , political editor of the capital 's free daily newspaper , @entity147 , which has endorsed @entity21			1
" these are the two best - known politicians in the country outside of the @entity155			0
" and while the job of mayor is largely ceremonial , whoever holds it does have control of a Â £ 14 billion ( $ 23 billion ) budget to run the city 's transport system and emergency services as well as promote business			1
one of @entity21 's most eye - catching initiatives has been his fleet of bicycles -- known inevitably as " @entity169 " -- that can be hired from streets across the city for short periods			1
@entity21 is an avid cyclist , but @entity18 has said the current scheme is elitist and plans to extend it south of the @entity175			1
this summer 's @entity17 will be another reason to win the election			0
@entity18 was instrumental in helping win the @entity17 in 2005 , and both candidates have claimed credit for the regeneration of east @entity0 near the @entity17 site			0
at @entity182 in 2008 , a famously disheveled - looking @entity21 waved the @entity17 flag			2
" when the job was created by @entity40 in 2000 , he was not looking to create a hugely powerful mayor , " @entity146 said			0
" compared with the @entity124 mayor , the role in @entity0 is more of a bully pulpit			0
" @entity18 earned praise for his condemnation of the 2005 terrorist bombings on @entity0 's transport system			1
he issued a defiant message to the terrorists , and a rallying cry to @entity96 in the wake of the attacks , which killed 52 people			0
" whatever you do , however many you kill , you will fail , " @entity18 said			0
three years later , though , he was voted out in favor of @entity21			0
so what does the election mean this time around , especially for prime minister @entity204 's conservative - led coalition government , currently lagging behind @entity20 in the polls ? " all the signs point to @entity21 winning by a small margin of between 2 % and 8 % , " said @entity146			1
" if he wins , @entity204 will get a huge boost , and it may help to keep his party intact			0
" conversely , a defeat for @entity18 will be a devastating loss for the young @entity20 leader , @entity212 , who is seen as struggling to establish himself in voters ' eyes			1
" if he loses @entity0 it will look as though @entity212 's lost the whole country , even though it 's not really about him			0
everyone sees a bloody nose			0
" if @entity21 wins , most analysts say his victory will be in spite of his party , not because of it			0
" he lifts himself above politics , " @entity146 said			0
" ' @entity21 ' is simply not seen as a conservative			2
the same has been said for @entity18 , but the price of celebrity is that if it fades , a politician 's appeal fades , too			2
" @entity21 has his critics , though , as an editorial in the left - leaning @entity101 made clear : " his overall substantive record is ... poor			2
many of the big things that have happened on his watch -- @entity236 [ a plan for a railway line across the city ] , the @entity17 , even the eye - catching bikes -- were @entity20 initiatives			1
since hard times came to @entity0 -- partly also @entity20 's doing -- mr. @entity21 has rarely attempted anything bold			1
he has been found wanting by recession			0
his environmental record is negligible			0
his police and crime policies have been destructive			0
" in the end , though , this is a contest between mr. @entity21 and mr. @entity18			1
there is no ducking it			0
and that means voting for mr. @entity18 as @entity0 's next mayor			1
" whoever wins will play a vital role during the @entity17 in terms of security , keeping transport running and ensuring athletes arrive on time			0
@entity21 's plan to close sections of some roads to general traffic so vips and competitors are not delayed -- mockingly called " zil lanes " after their use in @entity271 -- is proving controversial			2
@entity18 is among those who have criticized the plan			0
but as long as the capital 's red buses -- however they look -- run on time , most @entity96 will likely be happy .			1

about 6 million @entity96 are voting to elect new mayor
role largely ceremonial but mayor controls $ 23 billion budget
front - runners are incumbent conservative @entity21 and @entity20 's @entity18
transport is key issue , especially design of city 's famous red buses
