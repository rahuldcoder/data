-- @entity1 rolled out a new nexus 7 tablet on wednesday			2
but a much smaller , much cheaper new gadget may be the one that makes a seismic impact in the consumer technology world			0
@entity7 is a glorified thumb drive that enables web streaming to television			1
at $ 35 , it 's also practically free , considering that it comes packed with three free months of @entity12			1
streaming media onto the ( relatively ) big screen is nothing new			0
set - top boxes like @entity17 and @entity18 have provided the service , at least in part , for years			0
more recently , @entity1 's now - defunct @entity21 has battled @entity22 for the hearts and minds of consumers who have grown used to on - demand video on their laptops , tablets and even phones			1
with @entity7 , though , @entity1 appears to have stripped down web streaming to its purest elements			1
" it looks like they have learned from their mistakes , and radically simplified the experience , " @entity32 wrote for tech blog @entity33			0
" gone are the attempts to integrate existing pay - tv offerings , recruit app developers for yet another medium and ship devices with hideous , complicated remote controls			0
" instead , @entity7 is pure simplicity : search and discovery of video content is happening on the mobile device or laptop , and all @entity7 does is stream media from the cloud			1
" @entity1 and @entity52 have both tried and , at least so far , largely failed to make inroads into the living room with streaming tv products			1
@entity56 struggled to get some major content providers to play ball			0
and @entity52 ceo @entity59 has acknowledged that @entity22 has languished as more of a novelty for diehard fans than a mass - market success			2
( a full - on @entity52 tv set , which has been the tech world 's most - anticipated piece of rumored vaporware for the past couple of years , could of course change that )			1
those products , along with @entity17 , @entity18 and the like , have been , in a way , similar to traditional tv			0
approved " channels , " chiefly @entity12 , @entity72 and other web video services , are available			0
but @entity7 takes streaming to a whole new level -- offering a quick , simple version of what tech - inclined folks have been able to accomplish by rigging up their laptops or desktops with their tvs			1
essentially , if you can watch it on a computer , tablet or phone screen , you 'll be able to watch it on your tv			0
that 's the logical end goal of web streaming , and many analysts are saying @entity1 struck a huge blow by being the first to offer it up in a way that the typical consumer can understand and use			1
" by coming out early at an extremely affordable price , @entity1 may wind up dominating the tv delivery industry , " consumer tech analyst @entity97 wrote for @entity99			2
" it 's hard to imagine that @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and every other content provider is n't beating a path to their door			0
i imagine that the tv networks , too , are anxious to get their content on the device			2
" early interest in the 2 - inch gadget appears to be high			0
thursday afternoon , @entity7 was listed as out of stock on @entity72 and @entity117 's website			2
the @entity119 store was accepting orders , saying the device would be shipped in 3 - 4 weeks			0
while deals with the tv networks seem inevitable , @entity7 also could allow @entity1 to make deals directly with content providers , in much the way @entity12 has with original programs like @entity129 - nominated " @entity128 " and a revived " @entity130			1
" web tv services like @entity103 have thus far tried to limit their basic service to computer screens , offering the ability to stream to television for extra money			2
now , @entity103 says it 's working with @entity1 to offer an " optimized " version on @entity7			1
how @entity7 will impact @entity1 's battle with @entity52 remains to be seen			1
the existing @entity52 tv product , with its airplay feature that streams from the @entity142 , has its devotees			2
but it only works with @entity52 products , naturally			0
@entity7 is designed to work on any platform that can run its chrome browser			0
so a user could , for example , stream a @entity151 video from an @entity152 , then watch a @entity12 movie from a pc -- all streamed on a tv set through a @entity1 device			1
" on paper at least , it 's the best device @entity1 has ever announced ... , " @entity158 wrote for @entity159 , a @entity0 content partner			1
" did @entity1 just win the living room ? no. but it definitely just cozied up on a lot of couches and got comfortable			0

@entity1 's @entity7 could be a tv game changer , analysts say
the web streaming device costs $ 35 and plugs into tvs
its simplicity is the key , some say
how @entity7 will affect the tv battle with @entity52 remains to be seen
