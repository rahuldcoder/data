-- despite their public handshake on monday it appears there is still some way to go before @entity6 and @entity7 bury the hatchet			1
a long - running spat between the two golfers resurfaced after they shared a contentious round together at @entity12 in may			2
after several verbal volleys in either direction , @entity7 's joke that he would invite @entity6 round for " fried chicken " during the @entity16 led to an immediate and unreserved apology from the @entity20 , who denied it was racially motivated			1
a statement from the world no. 1 on social networking site @entity25 called the remarks " wrong , hurtful and clearly inappropriate			0
" woods also said that he was sure there was " real regret " on the part of @entity7 and that it was time to move on			1
inevitably , the issue resurfaced as both players prepared to come face - to - face ahead of the second major of the year at @entity36 in @entity37			1
the pair greeted each other on the practice range but the world @entity41 told a press conference on tuesday there had been no time for a formal apology			1
asked if they had discussed @entity7 's comments @entity27 replied : " no , we did n't discuss anything			1
just came up and said ' hi ' and that was it			0
" woods was pressed by reporters as to whether the @entity20 had offered him any form of apology but he said : " no , we have n't had time for that			1
" it 's already done			0
we 've already gone through it all			0
it 's time for the @entity16 and we tee it up in two days			2
" @entity7 told a press conference he had hoped to meet @entity27 after their practice rounds on monday but that the 14 - time major winner had gone by the time he had finished			1
" obviously we saw each other yesterday on the range , " @entity7 said			2
" i was hoping to meet him after the round , but he was gone after the round			0
" and this morning i was here early			0
i did n't see him around			2
obviously he got here later on			0
but i did leave him a note			2
and hopefully he can take a look at it			0
" i understand that it 's difficult to meet up and stuff			0
so hopefully we 'll be able to do it			0
if not , at least he has read the note and he 's happy with that			2
" the duo have been at loggerheads since an acrimonious round during the penultimate day of @entity12 in may			0
@entity7 claimed he had been disrupted during one of his shots after the gallery following @entity6 cheered as the 37 - year - old pulled a club out of his bag that signaled his intention to go for the green despite being in the rough			1
the @entity20 sliced his shot and made a bogey that saw him relinquish the one - shot lead he held at the time			1
woods went on to win the tournament with late errors seeing his rival slip down the leaderboard			0
their row rumbled on for a few more weeks until @entity7 was asked at a @entity105 event whether he would be inviting @entity6 round for dinner during the @entity16			1
@entity7 replied : " we 'll be having him round every night ... and serving him fried chicken			1
" fried chicken is a common food in the @entity114 , but when used in references to african - americans , it often implies a negative stereotype			1
@entity7 apologized and later said in an interview with @entity119 : " obviously it was an unfortunate comment from me			1
i did n't mean it in a bad way			2
everyone knows i 'm not racist at all			0
" it remains to be seen what reception @entity7 is afforded when bumper crowds hit @entity36 for the start of the tournament on thursday			1
former @entity131 @entity130 captain @entity129 , who has been targeted several times by @entity114 spectators , said @entity7 could face a rough ride from the galleries			1
he was quoted by @entity137 newspaper as saying : " yes , he could do , which is very sad for our game			0
remember we 're only a couple of hours from @entity143 and it 's a lively crowd and i think he could well be booed			0
" you would feel for him , but the trouble is [ if ] you feel for him that 's you condoning it			0
so you ca n't feel sorry for him because you 're condoning it			2
so it 's very difficult -- it 's a very difficult situation to be in			0
" @entity7 has been paired with @entity152 and @entity153 -- both major winners -- for his first two rounds , while @entity6 plays with 2011 @entity16 winner @entity156 and @entity157 , this year 's masters champion			1
this week will mark five years since @entity6 last won a major -- his 14th -- at @entity158 in 2008			2
he has since gone 20 without victory .			0
