-- his past largely defined by his @entity5 heroics , @entity2 's future is now in the hands of a @entity8 jury that could send him to prison for up to 15 years for hitting and killing a woman while allegedly driving drunk			1
opening statements begin monday in the trial of the former baseball star , who is charged with two counts of vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk in a 2007 wreck			1
a jury of five men and one woman , plus two alternates , has been seated in the case			0
according to court documents , the incident began as a nighttime celebration for @entity2 , who was ringing in his 44th birthday with friends by bar - hopping in @entity29 , @entity8			1
while driving a friend home shortly after 3 a.m. et on december 28 , 2007 , his red 2006 @entity30 hit the vehicle of 30 - year - old @entity33 , a @entity29 police report stated			2
she was thrown from her dark green 2000 @entity36 , knocked unconscious and pronounced dead at 4:08 a.m. blood drawn from @entity2 three hours later showed he had 0.14 percent blood alcohol level , above the 0.08 benchmark in @entity8			1

still , beyond determining if he was legally intoxicated , @entity2 's fate may be most tied to one key question : whether the light he went through , prior to hitting @entity33 , was red or yellow			1
