thrust from obscurity to notoriety overnight , captain @entity0 is the man at the center of recriminations over the @entity9 cruise ship disaster			1
the liner capsized after it struck rocks off @entity13 's @entity12 in the @entity14 in january 2012			0
no one died on impact but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of the 4,200 people on board the ship			0
on wednesday , an @entity23 court found @entity25 guilty of manslaughter and other charges related to the wreck , and sentenced him to 16 years in prison			1
over the past two years , the judges in the captain 's trial have heard from a wide variety of people , including passengers , crew members and technical experts			2
just before the judges got the case , the captain took the opportunity to speak again			0
breaking down in tears , @entity25 recalled that january day three years ago			1
" i died along with the 32 others , " he said			0
and since then , @entity25 insisted , he 's become a victim , processed by a " media meat grinder			2
" @entity25 , 52 at the time of the accident , admitted he had been " showboating " when he sailed the luxury cruise liner so close to the island of @entity12 , where submerged rocks tore through the hull			2
however , he said earlier the rocks were uncharted , and he did everything he could to preserve the lives of crew and passengers			0
the captain has previously pointed the finger at the @entity58 helmsman , whom he said did not speak @entity59 or @entity23 well enough to understand his orders , as well as the @entity62 cruise company for not providing maps with the rocks he hit appropriately marked			0
read more : how @entity9 was raised @entity25 has also blamed the ship itself , saying the generators did not work so the elevators did not function , hindering some people 's escape			1
@entity25 's lead lawyer @entity72 began closing arguments on monday by saying the champagne bottle used to christen the ship when it was put into service in 2006 did not break			1
" everything about this ship and this process since then has been a mystery so far , " he said			0
earlier in the trial @entity82 dancer @entity81 , who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge , gave evidence for the prosecution			0
@entity81 boarded the ship as a passenger but had worked on another @entity62 ship captained by @entity25 a few weeks earlier			1
the dancer admitted on the stand under duress that she and @entity25 had a sexual relationship , something the captain had previously denied			1
she also accused @entity25 of calling for a helicopter to rescue him , which he has denounced her for in a separate lawsuit			2
a native of @entity103 , near the southern city of @entity105 , @entity25 comes from a seafaring family , @entity13 's @entity101 newspaper reports			1
he graduated from the well - regarded @entity108 nautical institute in @entity109 , in @entity105 province , 30 years ago , according to the news agency @entity111			1
he joined @entity62 in 2002 as a safety officer , served as a staff captain , and was appointed captain in 2006 , according to the cruise line			0
like all @entity62 masters , @entity25 was " constantly trained , passing all tests			2
" costa chairman @entity118 , who retired after the disaster , had said @entity25 had never been involved in an accident before			1
however , in court it was revealed that in june 2010 he scraped his ship , the @entity123 , against a port wall in @entity125			0
after the 2012 accident @entity118 played down the possibility that alcohol played a role in the disaster , saying he did not believe @entity25 drank , and that all crew were subject to random drug and alcohol tests by @entity62			1
but @entity118 placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain , saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes in order to " impress the passengers , " as @entity25 admitted			1
@entity25 is also accused of abandoning his passengers , who were unable to look after themselves , and to whom he had a responsibility as captain , when he left the ship before they did			1
@entity72 tried to explain why his client left the ship ahead of so many passengers			0
he used a graphic to illustrate the inclination of the ship at the time @entity25 apparently lost his balance and fell into the lifeboat that took him to shore			1
he said that once on shore , @entity25 was able to conduct the rescue operation and that he never lost control of the operation			2
the attorney also addressed the famous exchange between @entity161 -- commander of the @entity163 the night of the accident -- and @entity25 , during which @entity161 told @entity25 to " get back on board for f * * k 's sake			0
" @entity72 called @entity161 's tone degrading and said the commander was unprofessional and egotistic at a moment when he should have been a voice of calm			0
@entity25 initially appears to play down the scale of the disaster , saying only that a " technical failure " has occurred			1
he then tells an official he has abandoned the vessel , according to the transcripts , which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation			0
but as the official questions his decision , @entity25 appears to reverse course and says he did not abandon ship but was " catapulted into the water " after the ship ran into a rock , began taking on water and started listing			2
as the night unfolds , the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why @entity25 , as captain , is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard			1
but @entity25 appears unwilling either to go back on board or to take charge of the desperate evacuation efforts , the transcripts reveal			0
in addition to questions over how @entity25 handled himself after the wreck , questions also lingered about whether the captain should have ordered an evacuation sooner and why no " mayday " distress signal was sent			2
