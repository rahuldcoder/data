@entity0 -- the @entity3 bus first appeared on @entity0 's streets in the 1950s and quickly became one of the city 's most recognizable icons			1
now , six years after it was phased out , @entity9 artist and designer @entity8 is taking inspiration from the famous @entity3 to re-define the look of @entity0 buses			1
with an international reputation for inventive and playful work , his approach blends sculpture with engineering			0
in 2010 , the @entity8 created a dramatic @entity20 -- a mass of acrylic rods with plant seeds on every tip -- for the @entity25 at the @entity26			1
turning the most commonplace public transport into a work of art proved to be an equally challenging feat. but in collaboration with vehicle manufacturer the @entity30 , the double - decker bus with a difference is becoming a reality			2
improving the passenger experience was a critical consideration in the design process			2
take the lighting , for example : current buses tend to be lit with fluorescent tubes which is n't the most flattering light , says @entity8			1
" that 's what 's tends to be used to illuminate a piggery , " he jokingly says			0
" so introducing some of the lighting techniques that are now used within interior environments is a very simple thing , but we feel it will make a very big difference to the experience , " he adds			0
the new bus also has three sets of doors and two staircases , which means you can get passengers on and off more quickly , @entity8 says			1
" that means you are more likely to get a bus that is on time because that means you are not waiting for huge queues to get on or off			0
" @entity8 says the new bus is greener too , with a hybrid engine which will be 40 % more energy efficient than a standard bus			2
it also does n't shudder when it 's stationary			0
" it 's going to be much quieter and calmer , " he says			0
the prospect of a calmer commute to work is one to relish in a bustling city of around 12 million people			0
passengers can look forward to getting on board the new buses early next year , in time for @entity0 's @entity81 .			1
