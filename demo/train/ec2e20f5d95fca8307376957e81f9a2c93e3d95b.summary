@entity0 , @entity1 -- billing @entity3 more than $ 516,000 for expenses incurred in trying -- and failing -- to prove the @entity0 woman guilty of murder in the death of her daughter is little more than sour grapes , one of her attorneys argued in a hearing friday			1
prosecutors say they have a right to demand repayment from @entity17 because she was convicted on four counts of lying to investigators in the disappearance of her daughter @entity3 in 2008			1
but defense attorney @entity23 said the bill is unfair after his client 's acquittal on the most serious charge of murder			2
" what about the justice for the defense that won ? " @entity23 asked @entity33 judge @entity32 " we 're now going to get whacked again ... pay for everything they did , their trips , their meals , their books , and their experts , none of which , none of which , had anything to do with the crimes of conviction , " @entity23 said			0
prosecutor @entity48 told @entity32 he should approve their request			0
" the argument of the defense completely misses the point of my position as it relates to the costs of prosecution specifically , " she said			2
" and that is that , but for ms. @entity17 's lying to law enforcement at the inception of this investigation , there would be no costs of investigation			1
" @entity32 did not rule on the request following friday 's lengthy hearing , which @entity17 did not attend			2
he will research legal briefs due next week and research the law before issuing a ruling			0
the @entity1 @entity71 said in a statement friday that @entity17 checked in with her probation officer -- on thursday -- as ordered under the terms of her sentence following her 2010 conviction on check fraud charges			1
@entity17 told her probation officer that she is unemployed , has not earned any income over the past 30 days and has not enrolled in any educational or vocational classes			1
" no violations have been noted " of @entity17 's probation , which include prohibitions against illicit drug use and excessive drinking , the department said			1
the meeting took place out of the public eye , as @entity17 has remained in seclusion since her release from prison in july following her acquittal on murder charges in the 2008 death of her 2 - year - old daughter			0
in fact , corrections officials have not disclosed her whereabouts , citing concerns for her safety			0
@entity3 's skeletal remains were found in december 2008 in woods less than a mile from the home she shared with her mother and grandparents			1
@entity17 's attorneys admitted she lied to authorities during the search for her daughter , saying she knew that she was dead			1
her attorneys have alleged that the girl died accidentally			0
in seeking reimbursement , prosecutors have cited a @entity1 law that allows the state to fine defendants in criminal cases to recoup money spent			0
prosecutors say the @entity127 spent $ 293,123.77 on the case and the district attorney 's office spent at least $ 140,390.60			2
the @entity131 spent $ 71,939.56 and the @entity132 spent $ 10,645.38 , according to court documents			0
but @entity23 said prosecutors are asking for reimbursement for items that have nothing to do with the crimes of which she was convicted			0
he said , should @entity32 find that there is some merit to the state 's motion , that he should limit expenses to only those costs related to police efforts to locate @entity3			1
@entity148 's @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
