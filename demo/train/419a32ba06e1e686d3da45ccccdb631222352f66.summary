with a ruined centuries - old castle looming up on the hill above , the @entity1 village of @entity2 could easily take a starring role in a gothic horror film			2
however , exactly 400 years ago , on august 21 , the horror was all too real , as the life of the most prolific female mass murderer of all time -- a noblewoman by the name of countess @entity12 -- came to a grim end			1
it 's not an anniversary they 're likely to celebrate in @entity2 , where @entity12 's reign of terror still haunts locals , but for some -- me included -- there 's a strange fascination			1
in the lovely @entity1 town of @entity25 , my friend @entity23 and i are joined by two guides , @entity27 and @entity28 , who work in the local tourism office			2
they drive us to the town of @entity2 , 30 kilometers away , recounting the story of the @entity12			1
the macabre name came from her apparent tendency to bathe in the blood of her victims			1
she 's said to have believed the blood of virgin girls would maintain her youthful - looking skin			1
@entity12 's life has been the subject of films , books and online websites -- and is thought by some to have influenced @entity50 's 1897 novel " @entity51 " -- but seems to have been forgotten west of @entity52			1
@entity53 and unaccountable , she was the absolute ruler of a patch of what is now @entity56 , and with the help of three of her servants sadistically tortured to death between 100 and 650 girls			1
we 'll never know the exact number			2
missing daughters she was married to a nobleman , @entity67 , a @entity68 national hero of the wars against the @entity70			0
although there were reported killings before his death in 1604 , afterward she seems to have become totally unhinged			0
she settled in @entity2 and more and more girls started disappearing from the surrounding villages			1
it was said she eventually ran low of girls to satiate her habit and she began to lure victims of higher born families , who began to notice their missing daughters			1
by 1610 , rumors of her horrible deeds had reached the @entity68 king , who sent his second in command , @entity88 , to investigate			0
in december 1610 , @entity12 was arrested along with three of her servants , who were tortured and burned at the stake			1
she was n't put on trial but walled - in at @entity92 , where she died on august 21 , 1614			1
@entity94 restoration @entity2 today is a well - off village with large houses sporting high hedges , satellite dishes and top - end @entity99 parked in the driveways			0
we could be anywhere in @entity103 but for a large , wooden statue of @entity12 in the main square			1
a sign points us to the castle , which stands 2.5 kilometers away in the middle of a thickly forested nature reserve			0
it 's a pleasant 40 - minute walk up the narrow stony path under oak , beech and chestnut trees , through mulberry bushes and wild strawberries			1
the castle is a ruin , but pictured alone against a blue sky , looks majestic and aloof			0
it reopened in june 2014 after a much needed two - year restoration			0
one tower collapsed in the 1980s leaving only two towers standing : an eastern defensive tower with a chapel and a south - facing residential tower where @entity12 died			1
amazingly , it 's still possible to walk around her living quarters , the likely location of her imprisonment and death			2
the roof has long disappeared , but the wall shows the sign of a ceiling			0
i reckoned it 's four meters ( 13 feet ) high in a four - by - five meter room			2
i shiver as i see the remnants of what looks like a bricked - up window			0
sense of shame what do the locals think of the countess today ? " the older generation seems ashamed of her			0
there were some protests when @entity12 's statue was erected in the square , " says 18 - year - old @entity149 , who has a summer job as a castle guide			1
" the younger generation does n't view the past so bad			0
we know she murdered women but she is not important to us			0
" before the castle reconstruction , we had barbecues inside and camped in tents overnight ! " back in the village , we step into the 14th - century church of @entity165 where father @entity166 shows us around			0
@entity12 was buried here , but no one has found her grave			1
her body was probably moved later to @entity170 , the @entity172 ancestral seat in today 's @entity68			2
father @entity166 has a surprise for us , however			0
he unlocks the @entity176 chapel outside , which boasts three painted wooden panels from @entity92			1
they are the only items remaining from the castle 's interior decoration			2
next to the church there 's a small but interesting museum with portraits of @entity12 and the people in her life , a reproduction of her clothes , old castle gravures and photos , as well as a range of heraldic insignia and local costumes			1
but it 's the local wine co-op we really want to see , and not just for the wine			2
the building stands on the site of the old @entity12 manor house			1
it 's here that the @entity202 conducted most of her torture sessions			2
today only an external wall still stands , but the original cellars that have seen so much pain and anguish are intact and are now used to store several wine barrels			0
@entity210 , one of the co-op owners , provides us with a tasting			0
the wines are uniformly excellent			1
some bear a " @entity217 " label			1
the brand was discontinued in 2010 , but after customer pressure , it was reintroduced in 2014 along with a special vintage celebrating the 400th anniversary of her death			2
it 's ruby red , of course			2
