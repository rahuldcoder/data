@entity0 , @entity1 -- once upon a time , the airship was hailed as the future of flight : as glamorous , luxurious and fashionable as the @entity7 era which marked its heyday			1
but a series of disasters , not least the crash of the @entity12 in @entity13 , in 1937 , with the loss of 36 lives , put paid to the dreams of intercontinental @entity18 travel			1
blimps are still a familiar sight in advertising , but those who design and build these aircraft believe there 's much more to them -- and to their future -- than simply signposting the local car dealership or giving tv audiences a better view of the football field during the big match			2
now , 90 years after the launch of @entity37 's first airship , the @entity32 , dirigibles and aerostats are undergoing something of a renaissance			1
among those hoping to lead the charge is @entity43 - based @entity42 , which is developing what it hopes will be a revolutionary new cargo airship , the @entity46 , combining elements of regular ' lighter - than - air ' ( @entity49 ) craft and traditional fixed - wing planes			1
in addition , it has a magic ingredient : the vertical take - off and landing capabilities of a helicopter , meaning it has no need for a runway or airfield			1
read more : test your aviation knowledge the idea was developed by @entity63 - born engineer @entity62 , who moved to the @entity37 in 1994 and set up in business building advertising blimps			1
he 's spent the past two decades working to solve the problems posed by traditional airships			2
" i understand airships well , " he told @entity2			2
" i 've built a lot of them			0
" his @entity46 is a rigid - hulled dirigible measuring a whopping 169 meters in length , with a payload of 66 tonnes ( and plans for a 250 tonne version ) , a cruising speed of up to 120 knots , and a range of 3,100 nautical miles			1
" it 's a little bit like my dream vehicle , " he said			0
" in natural disasters and other situations where infrastructure is non-existent , the @entity46 could be used to bring in emergency supplies : food , water , blankets -- 66 tonnes of relief at a time , " explained the company 's communications director @entity81			1
and while its primary purpose is likely to be logistical , moving cargo , military troops and humanitarian relief supplies into remote and inhospitable terrain , the company admits that down the line there may be other uses for the technology , from " floating hotels " to " sky yachts for millionaires			1
" read more : 50 years of @entity105 so far , the company has created a scaled - down version of the aircraft to prove that the design can work ; the next step is a full - size prototype			2
the aim is to have the first @entity46 flying by 2016 , and the initial fleet of 24 vehicles up and running by 2020 to 2021			1
" this truly is a game - changer , " said @entity114 , the company 's director of strategic finances			2
" it 's a real shift in industrial technology , on a par with the building of skyscrapers , or the creation of nuclear energy			0
" @entity62 and @entity81 say one of the @entity46 's biggest advantages is that it runs on regular diesel , rather than expensive aviation fuel which can be tough to get hold of in the world 's more inaccessible regions			1
but another airship project currently in research and development could end up being even cheaper and easier to power : innovation and engineering consultancy group @entity137 's @entity136 is a dirigible powered by solar energy			1
it 's an area the company has some experience in , having already worked on @entity144 , the world 's first plane powered solely by the sun. like @entity42 ' airship , the @entity136 is designed to carry large loads of cargo over long distances -- but the @entity136 is missing one component likely to be key to the @entity46 's success : the pilot			1
@entity137 's feasibility study is examining whether it is possible to move payloads of up to 250 tonnes from place to place in what is effectively a super-sized drone			0
read more : on your marks , jet set , go ! " we 're not looking to replace traditional forms of cargo transportation , " explained the program 's manager , @entity164			2
" container ships can carry 500,000 tonnes at a time -- we 're not looking to do that			2
" instead the idea is to be able to move large items , such as plane parts , long distances from one factory to another			1
@entity178 on solar power means the aircraft would be far slower than a regular plane , traveling at just 25km an hour , but the fact it is is unmanned means it could potentially remain airborne , at high altitudes , for lengthy periods of time			0
" it 's all about speed , and optimizing energy , " said @entity164			0
" what uses up energy is going fast			0
humans always want to be going faster but we 're not going to be carrying humans , so the slower speeds can be tolerated			0
" if and when the @entity136 gets off the ground -- which @entity164 admits is not likely to happen for some years yet -- it may well find it is n't the only airship hovering around above us			0
@entity37 defense contractor @entity200 is already planning to put its own aerostats ( airships which are tethered to the ground ) into the skies above the @entity37 capital , @entity207			1
read more : @entity210 airshow 's incredible moments but instead of carrying troops or manufacturing supplies , @entity200 's blimps will be loaded with surveillance equipment , to watch for the threat of attacks			0
the catchily - titled @entity221 , or @entity222 for short , is designed to scan the skies , the seas and the streets below for signs of danger , be it from incoming missiles and drones , or suspicious boats or trucks			0
" an airplane can only stay up for so long , but @entity222 is persistent , " said @entity200 's @entity229			0
" because it 's tethered , with its power source on the ground , it can stay up there 24/7 for 30 days at a time			0
" and because it 's so much higher up than radar on the ground , it can see much further , hundreds of kilometres , as opposed to tens of kilometres			0
" while @entity200 's blimps will be equipped with all the latest technology , the idea itself is nothing new : hydrogen - filled balloons were used for surveillance during the @entity243			0
it seems that some 260 years after the @entity247 first ascended into the skies above @entity210 in a hot air balloon , the glory days of the dirigible may be yet to come .			0

@entity37 company @entity42 developing *massive* airship to carry heavy cargo long distances
@entity46 will take off and land vertically , like a helicopter , without need for a runway
project is just one of a number of airships and aerostats being planned for a variety of uses
airships once feted as future of flying , but fell out of favor after the @entity12 disaster
