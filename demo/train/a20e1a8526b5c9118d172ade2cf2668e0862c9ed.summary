-- @entity2 's stumbling season suffered a new low on tuesday as the @entity4 failed to reach the @entity6 semifinals after being knocked out on penalties by fourth tier side @entity8			1
having made their worst @entity10 start since @entity11 took charge in 1996 , @entity2 needed a late equalizer to force extra-time -- only to lose a dramatic penalty shoot - out as @entity8 reached the last four for the first time in their 109 - year history			1
@entity11 has often fielded weakened sides for @entity6 matches but he sent out a strong team at @entity8 where the game ended 1 - 1 after 90 minutes , with extra-time failing to provide further goals			1
as they set about creating one of the biggest upsets in the competition 's long history , @entity8 opened the scoring through @entity30 after 16 minutes			2
despite the presence of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , the @entity4 failed to register a shot on target until the final quarter of a match against a team from the bottom tier of the @entity41			0
@entity2 captain @entity42 thought he had rescued his side when heading home after 88 minutes , but the @entity45 later turned from hero to villain as he missed the decisive kick in the penalty shoot - out to spark wild scenes of celebrations			2
" whenever you go out , it 's not a good result for @entity2 , " said @entity11			2
" we lost on penalties to a team who defended well			0
i can not fault the effort of my team , we gave absolutely everything for the 120 minutes and you have to give credit to @entity8			0
" the win meant that @entity8 , whose stadium was hosting its largest crowd since 1960 , had set a @entity68 record of nine consecutive penalty shoot - out wins			0
while the financially challenged club -- who were playing in the @entity10 eleven years ago -- will celebrate the vital income that comes from reaching the competition 's semifinals , @entity11 can expect ever greater scrutiny in a season that goes from bad to worse			0
many @entity2 fans were incensed when captain @entity78 was sold in august to traditional rivals @entity79 , with the league leaders now 15 points ahead of a team lying seventh in the @entity10 after 16 rounds			0
@entity11 , who won three league titles between 1998 - 2004 , angered some supporters earlier this year when stating his belief that it was more important for @entity2 to qualify for the lucrative @entity88 than to win trophies			0
without a trophy since the @entity92 win in 2005 , some @entity2 followers have lost patience as the gap between the club and rivals @entity79 and @entity97 grows -- with one group of fans recently protesting before the home defeat by @entity101 at the manner in which the club is being run			1
in the evening 's other @entity6 quarterfinal , @entity106 coach @entity105 enjoyed a return to @entity109 , the club he left in june , as the visitors came from behind to win 4 - 1			1
@entity8 and @entity106 will be joined in the semis by @entity101 or @entity112 , who play on wednesday , while the last quarterfinal will be known on 19 december when @entity117 host @entity115 , who are currently in @entity119 on @entity121 duty			1
in the @entity10 itself , @entity122 eased the pressure on coach @entity125 when beating @entity126 3 - 0 at home to climb out of the relegation zone and up to 15th in the table			0
in @entity132 , @entity131 's @entity130 bagged a hat - trick as @entity135 's 4 - 0 win at fifth - placed @entity136 perfectly set up @entity138 's side for sunday 's hosting of league leaders @entity141			1
the former @entity143 and @entity144 star needed less than an hour to register a treble , and take his tally to an unsurpassed 17 @entity148 goals , before @entity149 also struck as @entity136 suffered their first home defeat of the season			1
the win takes @entity135 to within two points of @entity141 , who can extend their lead before the weekend 's top - of - the - table clash at the @entity157 when hosting bottom side @entity158 on wednesday			1
@entity135 coach @entity138 was under pressure one week ago , with his side having surrendered top spot in the league , but three consecutive wins have given the @entity165 some breathing space			0
after beating @entity169 title - holders @entity168 2 - 1 to win their @entity88 group , the big - spending @entity132 side have since thrashed both @entity171 and @entity136 4 - 0			2
elsewhere , @entity172 beat @entity173 3 - 0 to reach the quarterfinals of the @entity175 .			0
