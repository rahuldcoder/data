-- the @entity1 are coming -- and this time @entity2 can not wait			1
@entity3 suddenly finds itself in the unusual position of being uber cool , and that is in no small part thanks to the first all - german @entity8 final on saturday , when @entity9 takes on @entity10 at @entity11 , the home of @entity13 soccer			1
from triple world champion @entity14 revving up as the poster boy of @entity16 , to @entity18 - winning actor @entity17 , -- who is the son of a @entity1 father and @entity21 mother -- starring on the big screen , @entity3 has a newfound confidence about itself			1
and yet , some stereotypes just wo n't disappear			0
within minutes of @entity10 's semifinal victory over @entity26 , the first " jokes " began to emerge with the @entity28 's tabloid papers jesting that " fans had their towels on the seats already " -- a reference to @entity1 holidaymakers ' apparent habit of claiming sun loungers at beach resorts			1
traditionally the @entity28 have had a particularly testing relationship with @entity3 , and it has much to do with the two @entity39 of the @entity40			2
as recently as a decade ago , stereotypical images of @entity1 decked out in @entity42 , socks and sandals goosestepping to the beat of the @entity46 armed with a @entity47 and quaffing a @entity48 were not uncommon in @entity28 red - top tabloids			1
on the terraces , @entity13 fans would taunt their @entity1 opponents with songs about @entity54 and the infamous " @entity55 " where the victory of the @entity57 during the @entity58 is recounted			2
@entity59 , one of the most popular @entity28 tv sitcoms of recent years , is one of the more contemporary programs to reference the " @entity64 " and " @entity65 , the @entity66			0
" but former tennis star @entity67 believes his country 's successful hosting of the @entity70 in 2006 has helped transformed @entity3 's image			1
" i think we have shown the world how diverse and multicultural @entity3 has become , " says the six - time grand slam champion , who has been hugely popular in @entity28 since winning @entity73 at the age of 17 in 1985			1
" we did a great job with the visiting fans , " he told @entity0			0
" and whoever was there seven years ago has seen a different side of @entity3 and have realized that the new @entity1 are much ' cooler			1
' " i would n't say that the @entity13 are falling in love with @entity3 , but i think they have respect for what @entity3 has achieved in the sporting world			2
" there is a new multicultural wave coming from @entity3 , which is very international and very cosmopolitan			2
" swashbuckling style @entity28 , too , has come a long way in its perception of @entity3 since @entity92 famously goosestepped his way around @entity94 as hotel owner @entity95 in one of the country 's most beloved tv comedies during the 1970s			1
it 's not just the swashbuckling style personified by @entity9 and @entity10 that has helped reinvent attitudes to @entity3 -- it 's also been reinforced by the nation 's football team under the guidance of ultra-cool @entity105			1
comprised of players from the @entity1 , @entity113 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 communities , @entity105 's squad produced the kind of exhilarating and vibrant football which helped the team reach the final of the 2008 @entity118 , as well as the semifinals of the @entity120 and 2012 euros			1
behind the scenes , the @entity121 , with its low ticket prices , safe standing areas and stylish infrastructure , has eclipsed the @entity126 and @entity128 's @entity127 as the hipsters ' choice			2
these days fans from all over @entity132 flock to stand on @entity10 's famous @entity134 terrace , to catch a glimpse of @entity9 or venture further to the likes of @entity138 in @entity139 , a favorite with many foreign supporters			1
" the weather is good and the beer is better , " quipped the @entity121 's chief executive @entity142 after being asked why @entity1 football attracts so many tourists			1
" but i think it 's more to do with safe standing , the relatively low ticket prices in relation to very attractive games and a good atmosphere at the stadium , " he told @entity0			2
" in 2006 , more @entity13 tourists were in @entity3 than ever before and in those four weeks we had great marketing and great weather			0
it was the best summer i can remember			0
" after the @entity70 , a lot of investment was made in stadium infrastructure , so it was really easy to get there			0
" we have a relatively low amount of season tickets , so it 's possible to get a ticket in the ' free ' sale at a fair price			0
if then , somebody says they want to see a @entity121 game , then that 's great			2
" football fans are also attracted to the @entity174 , a 16 - day celebration of beer held in @entity177 each year , with its clubs and bars making it a popular destination for bachelor parties and weekends away			0
jingoistic stereotypes @entity183 , an author and journalist , says he heard and witnessed anti-german chants and rhetoric when he lived in @entity13 between 2004 and 2007			0
the nations ' footballing rivalry stems back to the 1966 @entity70 final , when @entity13 controversially beat @entity3 in extra time at @entity11 as @entity191 scored a goal that is still debated to this day			2
@entity3 got revenge in @entity194 four years later , while the @entity13 have since suffered heartbreak against " @entity3 " in several high - profile tournaments since -- though 2001 's 5 - 1 triumph in a @entity70 qualifier in @entity177 provided some respite			1
" i once traveled on a train in northern @entity13 which was completely packed and then people suddenly began singing a vivid song about one @entity13 victory in football and two in wars , " says @entity183 , who lived in @entity200 between 2004 and 2007 , but now works in @entity201			0
" i think fighter pilots from the @entity57 were also mentioned			0
it must have been my looks which sparked them			0
i do n't remember having said a word , either pre- or post-singing , " he told @entity0			0
" obviously stereotypes related to @entity3 , both positive and negative , that have been very strong as a result of history and also our sporting history			1
" they also vary greatly ; others in @entity13 showed a strong sense of respect for the achievements and consistency of @entity1 football			0
" in 1996 , before @entity13 hosted a semifinal clash with @entity3 at the @entity118 , the tabloid @entity228 published a front page with the words , " @entity232 , surrender , for you @entity65 , ze @entity234 is over			0
" ten years later , @entity237 newspaper provoked fury from @entity1 chancellor @entity239 after publishing an unflattering photo of her from behind while she changed into a swimming costume with a headline of : " i 'm bigger than the @entity244			2
" that incident provoked fury in @entity3 and no shortage of embarrassment in the @entity28			0
but it 's not just in @entity28 , where this deep - rooted hostility towards @entity3 is alive and kicking			1
most recently , @entity239 has suffered from having her economic policies compared to those of the @entity253 by the @entity255 prime minister , while the the @entity1 leader has also been lampooned by the @entity258 press			2
media perception according to the 2011 @entity28 census , there are 274,000 @entity1 living on @entity28 shores			0
" at the moment it is really cool to read all the very well - informed and positive articles about @entity1 football in the @entity28 press , " says @entity263 , the director of educational links at @entity2 's @entity265			1
" since the 2006 @entity70 in @entity3 , the media perception of @entity1 football and @entity3 in general has dramatically changed , " added @entity263 , who has lived in @entity13 since 1986			1
" personally i never encountered stereotypical comments or remarks , but parts of the press here before 2006 were a different matter			0
" in my job i work on a @entity1 football project with @entity281 , which has two great and popular @entity1 players , @entity283 and @entity284			0
" the project is for school children and it is great to see how interested they are in in @entity1 football , too			0
" @entity10 's success in reaching the final has particularly struck a chord with neutral fans given the club almost went out of business eight years ago			1
under the guidance of charismatic coach @entity297 , whose popularity has seen a pop song written about him , @entity10 's run to the final has left even the most hard - hearted of seasoned aficionados willing on the men in yellow and black			1
" it is really nice to see how well @entity10 and @entity297 are liked all over @entity132 , " @entity302 , a devoted follower of the club , told @entity0			1
" everyone loves a little fairytale story like ours from nearly having to go into administration to being in a @entity8 final , and that is really all thanks to @entity297			0
" i guess that people in @entity13 also really admire it that we have done this without making big - money signings but by finding talents			0
" so as @entity9 and @entity10 fans walk down @entity318 , originally constructed by @entity1 prisoners of war in the 1940s , it will provoke a timely reminder of how the world has moved on			1
and it is @entity183 's hope that saturday 's showpiece will galvanize further change in attitudes towards @entity1			2
" this year 's @entity8 final may well prove to be a temporary culmination of changing perceptions towards @entity3 , " he said			1
" football has the power to change worldwide stereotypes and perceptions			0
it 's done so in the past and it will do so again			0
