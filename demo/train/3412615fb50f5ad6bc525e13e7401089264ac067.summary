-- here we go again			0
yet another supposed crisis in the ongoing soap opera between the @entity5 administration and @entity7 prime minister @entity6			1
@entity7 defense minister @entity8 , visiting @entity9 last week , was snubbed by top @entity11 officials			1
@entity21 , writing in the @entity22 under the headline " @entity24 in @entity20 , " anonymously quoted a senior @entity5 administration official calling @entity6 a " chickenshit " and said the prime minister " has told several people ... that he has ' written off ' the @entity5 administration , and plans to speak directly to @entity16 and to the @entity11 people should an @entity19 nuclear deal be reached			1
" we should be used to these by now			0
and that 's why those who are interested in these matters ought to lie down , take a deep breath and wait until this one passes			2
the @entity11 - @entity7 relationship is n't in crisis , and it 's not on the verge of failing			1
indeed , unlike @entity34 , it 's too big to fail -- despite the every real dysfunction at the top			1
and here 's why : first a little perspective and comment on the paradoxical nature of the travails of this very @entity42			2
this is n't by a long stretch the worst patch in the ties between these two countries			0
in 1956 , president @entity48 threatened actual sanctions against @entity7 and @entity50 if they did n't stand down from their attack against @entity54 president @entity53 and the @entity55			1
in 1975 , secretary of state @entity56 recalled @entity11 @entity58 ambassadors to reassess @entity11 - @entity7 ties to pressure @entity7 to accept the second @entity61 disengagement agreement with @entity54			1
president @entity62 withheld fighter aircraft to @entity7 over @entity7 's policy toward @entity65			1
former secretary of state @entity66 in 1990 banned @entity6 from the @entity67 for anti- @entity11 remarks			2
president @entity69 denied @entity7 loan guarantees over @entity7 's settlement policies			1
and in 1996 , @entity72 frustrated after his first meeting with then @entity6 , exploded , " who 's the f -- g superpower here ? " the difference in the tensions between now and then are twofold			2
first , in many of these cases , the @entity11 actually threatened to take consequential action or did act			2
second , in many of these former relationships , @entity7 and the @entity11 cooperated on important matters regarding peace and war and actually achieved much			1
today , we seem to have the worst of both worlds -- it 's just talk , and @entity5 and @entity6 are n't getting much done			0
so why the blow up ? we just had a supposed crisis over the @entity96 war , right ? the fact is the problem between @entity5 and @entity6 is chronic			2
several factors sustain it , driven by deep frustration and even anger reflected in the @entity5 ' official 's comment			0
first , these two do n't get along			0
@entity6 is gruff on the outside and unsure of himself on the inside			0
@entity5 is mellower in his exterior and supremely confident of himself inside			0
@entity6 is persuaded that @entity5 is unforgiving on the issue of understanding his politics and bloodless when it comes to @entity7 's security needs as a small power			1
and @entity5 is persuaded that @entity6 thinks not a whit about @entity11 interests and cares nothing about reciprocity			2
and then there 's the fact that @entity5 thinks @entity6 is exaggerating the downsides of a nuclear deal with @entity19 , and @entity6 believes the president really does n't get the severe risks of one			0
indeed , it might well be that the current tensions are related to the looming deadline next month for a comprehensive agreement with @entity19 on the nuclear issue and how each side will react if there 's an agreement -- or if one does n't materialize			0
one thing is clear : there 's no getting off this roller coaster ride so long as @entity5 and @entity6 are around			0
their personalities wo n't change and neither will the issues -- settlements , a two - state solution , @entity19 -- that divide them			0
but neither is there the need to rush to the conclusion that the @entity11 - @entity7 relationship is on the verge of a profound crisis that its friends fear and its detractors long for			1
first , neither @entity6 nor @entity5 is looking for an open fight			0
this behind - the - scenes trash talk is one thing ; a sanctioned public campaign to question @entity6 's manhood and competence is quite another thing			0
@entity5 has been reluctant to go beyond words because he knows there 's no profit in it			0
he ca n't stop settlements , promote a two - state solution or even marshal support for an @entity19 deal without @entity7 's acquiescence			1
and with midterms coming , what possible reason is there for a fight with @entity7 ? to show @entity19 that @entity5 's a tough guy ? that 's a good one			1
as for @entity6 , even if he were really popular at home , he ca n't afford to mismanage the @entity11 - @entity7 relationship			1
but he might have concluded that the administration is so bogged down in its own problems and the @entity58 is so rife with extremism and jihadi violence that @entity9 would n't dare go after @entity7 right now			2
second , the reality is that @entity11 public support for @entity7 remains high			1
and the behavior of @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity184 president @entity183 and the chaos in @entity186 and @entity184 make the turmoil in @entity190 nations the best talking points to support a strong @entity11 - @entity7 relationship			1
this is n't likely to change anytime soon			0
finally , there are productive and unproductive fights to have with @entity7			1
an unproductive one is done out of frustration , anger and with no strategy to actually get anything done			0
a productive one is done with purpose because there 's some problem that is worth pressing a close ally to solve ; and when the smoke clears , that fight leads to a result that everyone can claim as a success			2
@entity56 fought with @entity210 over disengagement agreements following the 1973 war ; @entity213 with @entity214 over @entity215 and @entity66 with @entity216 over getting to the @entity218 conference			0
the irony about the current " crisis " between two close allies is that there 's really nothing worth fighting about			2
and that makes for soap opera , not good policy .			0

@entity7 's defense minister is snubbed by top @entity11 officials , who also speak *negatively* about prime minister
@entity233 says it would be a *mistake* to portray this as a real crisis in relationship
@entity11 presidents have often *rapped* @entity7 , sometimes leading to positive outcomes
@entity233 : the problem with the latest *eruption* is that it 's *pointless* and unproductive
