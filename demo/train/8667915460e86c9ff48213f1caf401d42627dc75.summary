@entity0 , @entity1 -- while media outlets and @entity5 pundits might use state polls to gauge the race in @entity1 between @entity9 presidential hopefuls @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity12 uses poles			1
@entity12 , a @entity9 small business owner in this sleepy seaside town south of @entity16 , calls @entity11 a multi-millionaire who expects to get breaks because he 's rich -- be it a low tax rate or the @entity9 nomination			1
but former @entity22 house speaker @entity10 , @entity12 says , is a man who understands the plight of the working class and can articulate conservative principles effectively			2
picking up two fishing rods , @entity12 says the expensive @entity27 , priced at almost $ 400 , is like @entity11			1
meanwhile , the @entity28 , which he says does everything the other rod does but sells for about $ 50 , is like @entity32			1
" i got a customer , " @entity12 continues			2
" he has about six rod holders on the side of the boat			2
he 's got six @entity37 , and when he leaves port he has them on this side of the boat towards the docks , and when he comes in he puts them on the other side of the boat			2
we go out there because it 's a good day to be alive , @entity42 built a world let 's go enjoy it , but the elitist wants to impress their friends			2
" putting the poles back in the rack , @entity12 says , " @entity32 , as a capitalist wants to come out here with the working people and the people earn money from the industry of this country			1
@entity11 is basically an elitist			1
" and for conservative @entity1 voters , the term elitist is almost as bad as calling someone a liberal			1
that label is sticking with @entity11 , even though both candidates are worth more than many @entity67 earn in a lifetime			1
empty dock towns @entity1 locals like @entity71 say they can remember when industrial fishing and crabbing operations provided jobs for @entity1 , back before environmental regulations strangled the local economy			2
the median income in this conservative area is between $ 24,000 and $ 29,000			0
the sluggish economy is evident on boat docks , with its empty slips			0
soundoff : what issues matter to you this election ? most of the boats left belong to people " with their noses in the air , " @entity71 says			0
" i got a boat recently , " @entity71 says			0
" i took it to the dock i used to 10 years ago and the manager was happy to see me			0
but the owner " -- @entity97 sticks his nose up in the air -- " he did n't want me there , so i was told to go			0
" @entity97 says the wealthy dock owner did n't want his workboat " muddying up " the view			0
" @entity11 's one of them , " @entity71 says			2
" i liked @entity105 , but now i like @entity10			0
" state polls in @entity1 have n't given much hard data about @entity1 's rural areas , but a @entity2 / @entity111 / @entity110 poll released wednesday gave @entity32 a slight edge in north and central @entity1 while @entity11 was the favorite from @entity115 and south			1
@entity11 recently attacked @entity32 as a career politician who has n't lived in the " real streets " of @entity22			1
" well , that 's another thing , " @entity71 says laughing			0
" we got highways and roads here			0
" @entity32 motivates gun - owning liberals the prospect of a @entity32 candidacy is also exciting some of the liberals in the area			1
in @entity130 , a forested little town north of @entity16 , former teacher and " gun - owning liberal " @entity133 says she 's been talking about @entity32 a lot with her conservative father			1
one of the topics was an ex-wife 's interviews in which she says he wanted to have an open marriage			0
" @entity10 , he 's laughable , " @entity133 says			0
" it 's so interesting his ex-wife came out and says he wanted to have this polyamorous relationship			0
it 's just absolutely hilarious			0
who would want to have a polyamorous relationship with that man ? how can you run knowing that 's out there ? you should be embarrassed , you should be ashamed of yourself			0
" @entity133 says if @entity11 's nominated , she 'll vote for the @entity151 , but she wo n't engage in the election			1
" @entity11 is n't scary , " @entity133 says			2
but if @entity32 represents the @entity9 , she 'll stuff envelopes , knock on doors ... whatever she can do to help @entity32 lose .			1

@entity1 businessman sees @entity11 as privileged , not having earned his riches
even though both @entity11 and @entity32 are well - off , the term " elitist " has stuck with @entity11
@entity1 liberal says if @entity32 is @entity9 nominee , she 'll work to help *defeat* him
