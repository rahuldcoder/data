-- @entity1 is the legendary @entity2 coach who once sent a boot flying into the face of @entity5 , but a @entity7 sculptor has revealed a softer side to the formidable @entity9			1
@entity1 recently celebrated 26 years as @entity2 's manager this week , during which time he has won trophies at home and abroad as well as gaining a fierce reputation for the " hairdryer treatment " he dishes out to his players			1
but that was not the man sculptor @entity19 encountered after being commissioned to produce a nine - foot bronze statue of @entity1 which was unveiled on friday with a host of @entity2 legends in attendance			1
" he 's a very interesting character , " @entity19 , based in the @entity26 county of @entity27 , told @entity0 when asked about the 70 - year - old @entity2 boss			1
" he 's much more than you seen on the television			2
" when he came down to the studio he said , ' did you know that @entity33 had died ? ' and ' have you read the new biography of @entity35 ? ' he 's a very well - read man			2
" over the last quarter of a century , @entity1 has overseen @entity2 's ascent to the top of @entity26 football			1
the @entity40 team has won 12 league titles under his stewardship , helping it to a record 19 @entity26 championships overall , in addition to two @entity47 triumphs			0
benign expression raised in the working - class district of @entity50 in @entity51 , the 70 - year - old @entity1 is a staunch supporter of the @entity52			1
as a manager @entity1 has a no - nonsense reputation , letting go of top players like @entity5 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 when he senses they have outlived their usefulness to the @entity2 cause			1
a long - running spat with the @entity62 saw @entity1 refuse to speak with the @entity7 broadcaster for seven years after a 2004 documentary made unproven allegations of wrongdoing against his football agent son @entity67			1
but fellow @entity68 wanted to capture a different side of @entity1 for the sculpture which was unveiled during a ceremony ahead of saturday 's match with @entity73 -- the team he faced in his first match in charge at @entity40 in 1986			1
" i wanted him to have a slightly benign expression on his face , so that 's what he 's got			0
he 's wearing the sort of clothes he would wear at a match in the winter			0
" @entity85 @entity19 was already known to @entity2 's hierarchy after producing sculptures of former manager @entity88 and the legendary playing trio of @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			1
" i 'd already done the @entity88 sculpture for @entity2 some 12 - 15 years ago , " said @entity19 , who in his role as royal sculptor has produced works ranging from the archangel @entity98 and @entity97 to the young @entity99			1
" i did the @entity2 trinity of @entity90 , @entity102 and @entity92 and when that was completed we talked about doing @entity1			1
i did n't do anything immediately			0
" there was an opportunity when his 25th anniversary came up and they decided to name a stand after him			0
so it was decided it should be done to go in front of that			0
" in order to do justice to a man as respected as @entity1 , @entity19 built up an in - depth knowledge of his personality and appearance during several meetings			1
" i went up to see him , took a lot of photographs of him and spent some time watching him at a match , " explained @entity19 , who also produced a sculpture of @entity123 's @entity122 - winning squad of 1966 which is outside @entity124			1
" i got a lot of photographs from the @entity2 archives and also a lot of books that had been written about him			2
" to start of piece of sculpture is almost like researching for a book , you have to get to know the person very well			0
" it 's an amalgam of everything i 've seen of him and the meetings i 've had with him			0
i 've done him fairly pensive			0
he often stands on the edge of the pitch deciding on what 's going to happen next			0
that 's the moment i 've chosen to record			0
" when capturing a character like @entity1 , how did @entity19 select one stationary pose to epitomize a coach who is most often seen wildly gesticulating from the sidelines ? " i imagine him standing on the touchline in deep concentration , about to say something to the team which is going to change the tactics somewhat , " he replied			1
" one of the things he does is when the team has won or someone has scored a goal , he tends to put his hands in the air and wave them backwards and forwards			0
" that 's a very good pose for film , but it 's not a good pose for sculpture as it makes him look like he 's surrendering			2
" ancient tradition sports stars have long been the subject of works of art , with the athletes of ancient @entity179 often honored with carvings and statues			0
" sports sculptures , the tradition goes back to @entity185 times , " said @entity19			2
" if you look at @entity179 sculpture , it 's all of athletes or people who took part in the @entity192			2
it is carrying on a very long tradition			0
" there are practical advantages of depicting sportsmen for sculptors			0
" they have generally come to a job through being young , athletic sportsmen , " added @entity19			2
" the theme of fitness continues throughout their life			0
it makes them easier to sculpt because their bodies are well proportioned			0
" the sculpture of @entity1 will be the latest in a long line of monuments proudly displayed by @entity26 football clubs			1
@entity1 's fellow @entity9 @entity213 has a tribute outside @entity216 's @entity215 for the three league titles he won for the club between 1964 and 1973			1
@entity219 unveiled a statue of much - loved former manager @entity221 earlier this year			2
@entity221 , @entity123 's coach during the @entity222 , was a native of the north east and occupied the @entity219 hotseat for five years .			0
