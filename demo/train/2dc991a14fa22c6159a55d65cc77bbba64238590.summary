@entity0 -- private military contractor @entity2 " delayed and impeded " a congressional probe into the 2004 killings of four of its employees in @entity8 , @entity9 , the @entity10 said thursday in a report			1
family members of the slain @entity2 employees listen during a congressional hearing earlier this year			1
@entity2 contractors @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 were ambushed , dragged from their vehicles and killed on march 31 , 2004			1
the burned and mutilated remains of two of the men were hung from a bridge over the @entity24 , an image that fueled @entity27 outrage and triggered the first of two attempts to retake the city from @entity32 insurgents			0
the company stalled the committee 's investigation into the incident by " erroneously claiming " documents related to the incident were classified , trying to get the @entity39 to make previously unclassified documents classified and " asserting questionable legal privileges , " according to a report from the @entity10 's @entity44 staff			1
according to @entity2 's reports on the killings , the men killed in @entity8 had been sent into the area without proper crew , equipment or even maps			1
one company document found a " complete lack of support " for its @entity56 , @entity9 , office from executives at the company 's headquarters in @entity60 , the committee report states			0
" according to these documents , @entity2 took on the @entity8 mission before its contract officially began , and after being warned by its predecessor that it was too dangerous			1
it sent its team on the mission without properly armored vehicles and machine guns			0
and it cut the standard mission team by two members , thus depriving them of rear gunners , " the report states			0
in a written response to the report , @entity2 called it " a one - sided version of this tragic incident			1
" " what the report fails to acknowledge is that the terrorists determined what happened that fateful day in 2004 , " the company said			2
" the terrorists were intent on killing @entity27 and desecrating their bodies			0
documents that the committee has in its possession point out that the @entity2 team was betrayed and directed into a well - planned ambush			1
" the report notes that members of the now - defunct @entity97 " led the team into the ambush , facilitated blocking positions to prevent the team 's escape , and then disappeared			2
" @entity2 did not discuss details of the report 's findings , noting the incident is still the subject of a lawsuit by the slain contractors ' families			1
the committee 's chairman , @entity108 democrat @entity106 , has scheduled a hearing tuesday on @entity2 's operations in @entity9			2
the company 's chairman , @entity111 , is scheduled to testify at that hearing			0
the committee previously disclosed that the day before the fatal mission , the manager of @entity2 's @entity56 office warned his bosses he lacked armored vehicles , radio gear and ammunition			2
during february 's hearing and in a subsequent written response , @entity2 general counsel @entity122 told the committee that documents on the attack had been classified by the @entity27 government			1
but the @entity39 later told the committee the documents had not been classified			2
in addition , @entity2 made " multiple attempts " to get the @entity39 to declare company and @entity132 reports on the incident classified , the report states			1
the families of the slain men have sued @entity2 , one of the most familiar of hundreds of private military contractors operating in @entity9			2
the families allege the company failed to provide their relatives with adequate gear and weaponry			0
@entity2 has denied the allegations and argued the men agreed to assume the risks of working in a war zone			0
thursday 's report adds to the intense scrutiny the company has faced since it was involved in shootings september 16 in western @entity56			0
@entity9 authorities said @entity2 guards protecting a @entity27 @entity155 convoy opened fire indiscriminately , killing as many as 20 civilians			0
@entity2 said its employees responded properly to an insurgent attack on the convoy			1
deputy secretary of state @entity160 on thursday told a @entity162 committee that " something went tragically wrong " in the @entity56 incident , and that the @entity165 and @entity9 authorities are conducting a thorough investigation			0
he said @entity2 guards had fired their weapons on 56 of the 1,873 escort missions they have conducted in @entity9 in 2007 , " and each such incident is reviewed by management officials to ensure that procedures were followed			1
" " i personally was grateful for the presence of my @entity2 security detail , largely comprised of @entity178 and other military , when i served as ambassador to @entity9 , " @entity160 told the @entity173 on wednesday in response to questions			0
" their alert and controlled posture kept me safe -- to get my job done			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
