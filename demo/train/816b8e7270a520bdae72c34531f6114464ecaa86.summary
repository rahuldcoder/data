-- juror @entity1 found it hard to understand what witness @entity4 was talking about			1
and after the jurors acquitted @entity7 in the death of @entity4 's friend @entity9 , the feeling certainly was mutual			1
after a trial that divided many @entity14 by their views on race , guns and self - defense , @entity0 's exclusive interviews with the witness and the juror monday night illustrated their starkly different frames of reference			1
juror : ' @entity22 ' that @entity7 feared for his life they disagreed about whether @entity7 racially profiled @entity9 when he saw him walking through a @entity26 , @entity27 , neighborhood			1
but much more than race separated their perception of what happened the evening of february 26 , 2012			2
when is it reasonable to suspect wrongdoing by a teenager walking through a neighborhood ? is a neighborhood watch volunteer a helpful member of the community or a " cracka " trying to wear the authority of a police officer ? does the jargon of a 19 - year - old witness demonstrate her lack of education or an older generation 's lack of awareness ? @entity4 ' upset , angry ' by verdict the role of race race was perhaps the simplest disagreement			1
let 's be honest , racial			2
if @entity9 was white and he had a hoodie on , would that happen ? " the 19 - year - old @entity4 asked on @entity0 's " @entity57			1
" but the juror , who requested anonymity and sat in darkness on @entity0 's " @entity62 360 , " said the jury of six women -- five white and one an unspecified minority -- never talked about racial profiling			1
" i think all of us thought race did not play a role , " she said			2
@entity9 's movement so why did @entity7 suspect @entity9 might be up to no good ? the juror sided with @entity7 's account , and said @entity9 " was cutting through the back " of the neighborhood " looking into houses			1
" " he was stopping and starting , " she said			2
" it was late at night , dark at night , raining			2
and anybody would think anybody walking down the road , stopping and turning and looking , if that 's exactly what happened , is suspicious			0
it was shortly after 7 p.m. , she said , a time when typically people might be out walking their dogs , not plotting burglaries			0
and if anyone should have been alarmed , it was @entity9 , she said			0
he told her in their now - famous phone call that a man was following him , and she said she warned him it could be a rapist			0
parents tell children to fear such people , @entity4 said			1
otherwise , " you 're going to see your child on the news , missing person			0
" she expressed disbelief any of the jurors who were parents would not understand that			0
juror @entity1 did not disclose biographical information in her @entity0 interview			1
according to @entity109 , @entity0 's sister network , she has been married 20 years and has two adult children			0
despite outrage , federal charges uncertain in @entity7 case ' phrases i have never heard ' @entity4 testified @entity9 told her on the phone that a " creepy - ass cracka " was following him as he returned home from a convenience store run for a bag of @entity120 and a can of @entity123 iced tea			1
in the @entity0 interview , she said " cracka " is a term for someone who wants to act like a police officer			1
she said it was not the same as calling a white person a " cracker			0
" the juror did n't take " cracka " as a racial slur but an indication of " the type of life that they live ... and the environment they 're living in			1
" " a lot of the times she was using phrases i have never heard before , " the juror said			2
fringe protestors turn violent in @entity147 after verdict generational divide ? she did not find @entity83 credible , the juror said , but " i felt very sorry for her			2
... i think she felt inadequate toward everyone because of her education and communication skills			0
" when @entity158 played that clip for @entity83 , the teen said she felt upset and also misunderstood			1
she said she has a speech impediment due to an underbite			0
and her vocabulary is odd only to older people , she said			0
the jurors , she said , are " old - school people			0
we ( are ) in a new school , our generation , my generation			0
" perhaps they judged her as uneducated , @entity4 said , but she said she felt criticized for being " too honest			1
" her generation uses " cracka " and even a variation of the n - word as a non-racial term for any man , she said			0
" the jury 's so shocked what i said , and they 're acting like the generation we got now do n't say that			0
" now that he 's free , can @entity7 make a living ? impressions of @entity7 not surprisingly , they came to vastly different conclusions about the defendant			0
" i think @entity7 is a man whose heart was in the right place but just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods , and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done , " the juror said			2
@entity4 called @entity7 " scary " and branded him " weak " for declining to testify at his trial			1
" if you were a real man , you would 've stand on that stage and tell what happened , " she said .			0
