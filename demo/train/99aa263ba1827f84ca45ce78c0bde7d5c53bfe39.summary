@entity0 , @entity1 -- choose your adjective : hardball			1
down - and - dirty			2
@entity1 has a rich and storied history of tough political tactics			1
there 's the stooge third - party candidate allegedly recruited by legendary @entity13 operative @entity12 to deliver anti-semitic attacks against @entity16 congressional candidate @entity15 in 1978 or the shadowy " push polls " about black babies that helped undercut @entity22 sen. @entity21 's renegade presidential bid here in 2000			2
it 's the fun and easy topic for pundits to chew on when they drop in to the first - in - the - @entity1 primary state after frigid tours of duty in @entity30 and @entity31			1
but are @entity1 politics as nasty as advertised ? few here question that the state has a permissive political culture that sometimes celebrates mischief and mudslinging			1
in a @entity13 - dominated state where primary campaigns tend to be decided more on personality than major differences on issues , " dirty tricks " seem to bubble up in @entity1 more frequently than elsewhere			1
but the reality is that it 's been more than a decade since devious tactics like unidentified robocalls or suspicious mailers have derailed a statewide candidacy			1
" i think people have become sort of jaundiced about the whole dirty - trick thing , " said state sen. @entity51			2
" they see some of that ambush stuff , and they take it with a giant grain of salt			0
" the last time an orchestrated sneak attack seriously damaged the fate of a campaign was 2000 , when anonymous @entity63 supporters carried out a sinister assault on @entity21 's character , questioning his patriotism and the race of his adopted daughter in a wave of anonymous phone calls			2
but the most recent @entity13 presidential primary fight in @entity1 told a different story			2
while there were plenty of shady stunts and headline - grabbers during the 2008 @entity13 primary -- several of them perpetrated by the @entity81 campaign -- none had a major impact			0
@entity83 , a @entity81 consultant during the 2008 race in @entity1 , was caught red - handed after creating a web site called " @entity86 " that impugned then - candidate @entity89 's conservative bona fides. the @entity81 staff in @entity0 also had a penchant for dressing up interns in masks and dispatching them to protest at rival events			1
in one case , when @entity96 was taking fire in late 2007 for his parole record in @entity99 , @entity81 aides convinced two interns to dress up in prison stripes and protest several @entity96 rallies			0
the most craven hit actually came against @entity81 : just after christmas 2007 , someone sent anonymous postcards to @entity1 mailboxes calling attention to the former @entity112 governor 's @entity110 faith			1
the effort , though , had little impact			0
@entity81 was already trending down in the polls when the postcards landed			0
ploys like those are a surefire way to generate media attention			0
but strategists in @entity1 these days wonder if they actually work			2
in 2010 , then - gubernatorial candidate @entity121 was called a " raghead " and subjected to a series of unproven claims that she had committed adultery -- but the attacks backfired and @entity121 was next to untouchable on her way to the governor 's mansion			1
though the practice of dirty politics may always have a place in @entity1 -- and might still rear its head in this presidential race -- times have changed since the @entity12 era			1
the harsh attacks that are consuming the primary race as it opens -- @entity81 is being painted as a corporate raider who fired workers for a better bottom line , and @entity143 as a pork - barrel politician extraordinaire -- are neither sneaky nor underhanded			0
they are straightforward and on the record , delivered straight from the candidate 's mouths or in the form of television ads from the campaigns or cash - flush super pacs			0
anonymous political attacks , meanwhile , often take the form of @entity156 videos or unsourced document dumps to web sites like @entity159 , the popular @entity0 - based political blog run by @entity161 , the first of two accusers in the @entity121 affair story			1
meanwhile , master practitioners of the so - called " dark arts " are no longer the central players in @entity1 's always entertaining political dramas			1
" after @entity12 died , there was an entire generation of consultants who looked in the mirror every day and said , ' i 'm going to be the next @entity12 , ' " one @entity1 @entity13 strategist told @entity2			2
" and those folks are all moving on and moving out			0
" one of the @entity1 's most famous and colorful political tricksters , @entity175 , died last year after a long battle with brain cancer			1
two renowned political consultants in @entity1 who famously battled on opposite sides of the @entity183 trenches in 2000 , @entity178 and @entity179 , are still kicking			2
@entity179 advises former @entity185 gov. @entity184			0
both men still do campaigns and political strategy but now retain side businesses as well , and their rivalry has long since waned			0
" we do n't have an ax to grind against each other , " said @entity178			0
" we are too old for that			0
" there remains a small crop of political operatives who make a living getting inside the heads of rival campaigns			1
they are largely unknown outside of the political class in @entity0 , and they universally refuse to go on the record to discuss their tactics -- for legal reasons , in some cases			2
and crucially , most of them are sitting on the sidelines in this presidential cycle			0
" i am just not being paid to screw with anybody this time , " one of them told @entity2			0
" the super pacs are doing that ... it 's a shame			0
i know exactly what i would do to two or three of them			0
" political campaigns are now being run by a younger and newer generation of operatives , many of them with no ties to @entity1 other than their candidates			1
the last three successful gubernatorial races in @entity1 -- @entity226 's in 2002 and 2006 , and @entity121 's in 2010 -- were steered by @entity228 - based consultant @entity227			1
and the day - to - day operations of @entity121 's campaign were managed by @entity232 native @entity231 , then a 27 - year - old			1
@entity231 , now @entity121 's chief of staff , argued that storylines about the state 's grimy political culture generate media hype but only matter to reporters and the behind - the - times political operatives who talk to them			1
" it 's a narrative driven by political consultants , for political consultants , " @entity231 told @entity2			2
" if @entity121 's election proved anything , it 's that message and a connection with the people matters more than sideshow political nonsense , and that the voters of this state are far smarter than they 're given credit for			1
" still , @entity21 's presidential campaign in 2008 demonstrated how easy it is to bait the media into talking about @entity1 's bare - knuckle reputation			1
in a bid to generate sympathetic coverage about their candidate , @entity21 aides circulated to reporters a scanned version of an anonymous flier that they claimed to have uncovered in a far corner of the state			0
the crude - looking flier , which existed only in e-mail form , mocked @entity21 's prisoner - of - war experience in @entity270			0
no one in the media was able to verify that the fliers were distributed to anyone other than journalists			0
but cable news and the @entity277 were abuzz for several days with stories about how @entity21 was once again under attack by nefarious forces			0
it worked : @entity21 's won the primary and went on to capture the @entity13 nomination			0
" the fact is that the only real dirty trick that happened last time was @entity21 claiming there were dirty tricks against @entity21 , " groused one @entity13 who worked for an opposing campaign at the time .			1

" dirty tricks " seem to bubble up in @entity1 politics more frequently than elsewhere
but it 's been more than a decade since such tactics have derailed a statewide candidacy
