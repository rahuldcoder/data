in a statement issued saturday , the military said @entity5 's order would enable the @entity4 - led coalition and @entity1 security forces to " intensify their focus on @entity20 in @entity1 ... without distraction from [ @entity9 ] attacks			1
" @entity24 's suspension -- which one of his senior aides said would be a period for restructuring -- comes after nearly 60 people were killed and scores were injured during recent street fighting between armed @entity6 factions in @entity33 and @entity0			0
" @entity5 's declaration holds the potential to reduce criminal activity and help reunite @entity1 separated by ethno - sectarian violence and fear , " the @entity4 military said			1
the cleric , who emerged as a popular grass - roots @entity6 leader after the @entity4 toppled @entity42 , has been staunchly opposed to the @entity4 occupation			0
the @entity4 military has tangled with his forces in @entity0 's @entity47 and in southern @entity1 and , through the years , his political clout across @entity1 's @entity6 heartland has grown			1
the military believes rogue members of @entity5 's group have smuggled weaponry and received training from @entity52			1
an end to @entity9 " would also be an important step in helping @entity1 authorities focus greater attention on achieving the political and economic solutions necessary for progress and less on dealing with criminal activity , sectarian violence , kidnappings , assassinations , and attacks on @entity1 and coalition forces , " the military said			1
@entity24 has openly opposed violent actions before , and last week he called for calm and urged his followers not to attack rivals ' offices			0
but observers think that many @entity9 fighters are breakaway forces who are more radical than @entity5 himself			2
@entity1 's government hopes the @entity9 's hiatus will spur similar moves by other armed groups			1
" this initiative is an encouraging step toward consolidating security and stability throughout the country and an opportunity for the suspension of the work of the rest of the militias in various political and ideological affiliations to preserve the unity , independence and sovereignty of @entity1 , " prime minister @entity80 's office said thursday			1
