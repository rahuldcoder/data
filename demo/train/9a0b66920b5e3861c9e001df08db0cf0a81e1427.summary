-- a medical marijuana advocate turned write - in candidate for @entity4 governor has garnered instant social media attention by smoking what she says is pot in a campaign video			1
but her media stunt comes with a more serious political message about pot legalization			1
" i 'm @entity14 , and i 'm going to be the next governor of @entity4 , " she says in the minute - and - a - half - long video			1
" and i hope that during my tenure , i will be able to dispel a number of misconceptions about cannabis use			2
" @entity20 , who said she smokes cannabis every day , uses it for medicinal purposes , and also argues that it helps her focus and communicate with people around her			2
in the video , she takes a hit off a pipe after insisting that pot users " should n't be ostracized or marginalized			1
" " it does n't make people crazy the way you 've been told , " she says			0
" we 've been lied to for a long time by our government , and something that 's been essential to our health has been taken away from us			2
" " yes , i do smoke cannabis			0
and yes , i do inhale , " she says , invoking former president @entity41 's famous " did n't inhale " remark during his first run for president in 1992			2
the stigma about marijuana has clearly lessened since @entity41 's comment			1
then - sen. @entity47 in 2006 admitted , " i inhaled -- that was the point			2
" and he went on to be elected			0
' i like weed , and i 'm a good person ' both @entity47 and @entity41 have now said states should be able to carry forward with medical marijuana , as @entity20 says she uses			2
but it is the official position of the @entity55 that marijuana is a schedule 1 narcotic			0
some former politicians have gone even further than just advocating allowing medical marijuana			1
upon retirement in 2011 , former democratic congressman @entity61 of @entity62 became the president of a medical marijuana company in his home state , where medical marijuana is legal			0
he resigned from his post earlier this month after a failed bid to earn licenses to open three dispensaries in the state			0
@entity73 , the former @entity74 governor of @entity75 and @entity77 2012 presidential candidate , has long been an advocate for pot legalization			1
now , he 's taking that support to a new level by signing on this summer as the ceo of a @entity83 - based firm that aims to sell recreational marijuana products			1
" i think in 10 years , for the most part , the @entity85 will legalize marijuana			0
and what the @entity85 does , so does the world , " @entity73 told the @entity88			0
large changes are already underway : medical marijuana is permitted in 22 states and the @entity94			0
ballot initiatives in @entity97 and @entity96 paved the way for legalization there for adults over 21			0
voters in @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity61 will find the legalization question on their ballots			0
and pot advocates filed paperwork wednesday to begin a legalization campaign push in @entity109			1
but it 's still safe to say that @entity20 's single - issue campaign in @entity4 is a long shot			1
she 's up against a crowded field of candidates including @entity117 @entity116 , @entity74 @entity118 , one candidate from the state 's @entity119 and two independent candidates			1
@entity20 's name wo n't appear on the ballot , but efforts like hers to " remove the stigma " about marijuana use could last long beyond november 4			1
