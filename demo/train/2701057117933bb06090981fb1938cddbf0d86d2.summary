-- @entity2 general manager @entity1 has had a busy few days			1
his popular website , which thrives on real - time message boards and contributions by users on a variety of topics , received record traffic -- as well as pointed criticism -- for its treatment of the @entity13 bomber case			1
in particular , critics took @entity2 to task for what they perceived as its overeager determination to help authorities identify suspects in the many images of the scene being shared online			1
one group of redditors , as the site 's users are known , speculated that @entity27 , a @entity28 student who has been missing since last month , could be a possible suspect			1
@entity27 's family temporarily took down a @entity31 page asking for help finding him after they were bombarded by ugly comments			2
other @entity2 users focused on two young men with heavy - looking bags , one of whom wore a blue track suit			1
the @entity41 even splashed a photo of the two marathon spectators on its front page with the headline , " bag men : feds seek these two pictured at @entity13			1
" the guy in the track suit turned out to be a 17 - year - old suburban @entity51 track star who told @entity52 he was afraid to leave his house because of the scrutiny			2
reaction was quick and scathing			0
the @entity57 's @entity56 wrote a column called " hey @entity2 , enough @entity64 , " and followed it up with a story on how the names of two innocent people got repeated in a viral loop on social media			1
@entity65 addressed the issue in a similar salon column , " the internet 's shameful false @entity68			0
" the moderator of a subreddit , or comment thread titled findbostonbombers , which had been set up to crowdsource the identities of the bombers , apologized			0
@entity1 agrees with some of the criticism			1
" the crowdsourced , more criminal investigation was very volatile and fraught with problems , and , obviously , wrong , " he told @entity0 in an interview monday			0
" that was something we all wished had n't happened			0
" he posted a note on the site that went into more detail			0
" we hoped that the crowdsourced search for new information would not spark exactly this type of witch hunt			1
we were wrong , " it read			0
noting the site 's rule against widely sharing personal information , it added , " the search for the bombers bore less resemblance to the types of vindictive internet witch hunts our no - personal - information rule was originally written for , but the outcome was no different			2
" canvassing the internet but , @entity1 adds , @entity2 did a lot of good as well			1
another subreddit , devoted to aggregating the news as it happened , is only the second thread in the site 's history -- after president @entity110 's " @entity109 -- to outpace @entity2 's mainpage in traffic			1
the site overall peaked at 270,000 visitors -- 50 % higher than its usual -- when bombing suspect @entity115 was captured friday night			0
@entity2 's ability to stay current is one of the site 's great advantages , writes @entity121 's @entity120			1
" as a massive community on the hunt for interesting things , it can canvas the internet in ways that a single news organization or reporter can not , " he wrote			2
@entity131 also used @entity51 - area threads to let visitors know what streets were passable and closed , worked to get pizzas to hospitals and emergency workers , helped find hotel rooms for stranded visitors and even arranged a meetup at a park for playing with dogs			0
that 's the thing about crowdsourcing and social media , says cybersecurity expert @entity146 : the media are only as good as their contributors			1
in general , getting more people involved can be beneficial to law enforcement , says @entity146 , the head of the @entity152 , @entity153 at @entity155 's @entity154			1
" initially , it helps , " he says			0
" my experience is that , with any piece of evidence , the more people who look at it , the more likely you are to get a different viewpoint			2
the more eyes that see it , the better off you are			0
" a new protocol ? on the other hand , @entity126 participation is so new that law enforcement is n't sure how to handle it , he says			0
it 's like the old - fashioned police - tip lines , except on a much bigger scale			0
( after the @entity177 released photos of the bombing suspects , its website received more than 300,000 tips per minute , according to news reports			1
) like eliminating bugs from software programs , it takes time to weed the cranks out of the system -- and , in a fast - moving case like @entity51 , the cranks went viral , as all the false ids and dead ends indicated			2
" i think there 's a lot of issues with doing this , but i hope these people have a protocol , " @entity146 says			1
@entity197 , a 24 - year south @entity198 law enforcement veteran , agrees that participants on sites such as @entity2 should funnel their theories and suggestions to authorities			1
" on the computer , you can do whatever you want to , as long as you do n't interfere with somebody 's rights , " says @entity197 , who now heads a private firm called @entity205			0
" i always say , give us the information , let us do the legwork , let us do the computer work , let us do everything			0
" it 's not just for reasons of privacy and proper legal protocol , he adds			0
@entity197 has had tipsters call who tell him they 've been conducting surveillance on suspects , which makes him furious			2
" what if they 're following the real suspect ? what if they 're following a murderer ? once that person realizes there 's somebody following them , the chances are pretty good they 're going to get hurt , " he says			2
and hiding behind a computer is no promise of safety , he adds : " even contacting that person online can still be traced back to you			0
" media mixups as with past episodes -- such as the naming of the wrong suspect in the @entity245 massacre -- the frantic pursuit of information can come perilously close to mob justice			2
the subreddit board , interestingly , was aware of how things could go wrong			0
throughout last week 's chain of events , two of the most popular entries were dedicated to @entity254 , the man falsely accused of the @entity258 @entity257 bombing , and a link to an @entity261 video on " @entity262 , " a figure who has been wrongly named in a number of @entity266 conspiracy theories			0
both functioned as warnings for what could happen when gut reaction overwhelmed calm rationality			0
@entity272 , the redditor who set up findbostonbombers in the first place , kept trying to rein in both @entity2 users and the news media			1
" @entity279 , please stop making the images of potential suspects go viral , then blaming this small subreddit for it , " he titled one post			1
" until the media got involved , none of the images were going anywhere but to the @entity177			1
" but maintaining control is always going to be a challenge on such free - flowing sites , says @entity2 's @entity1			1
" i do n't think we can fix the basic problems with human behavior , " he says			0
but , he adds , " we can certainly mitigate it			0
if we can make sure to channel people 's desire to help and adrenaline - fueled activity into things that are clearly positive and are n't fraught with as many dangerous ( possibilities ) , that should be the aim for any future crisis			2

@entity2 received some criticism for its handling of the @entity13 bomber case
some @entity2 users , poring over images , *fingered* innocent people as potential suspects
@entity2 general manager @entity1 says he *regrets* " this type of witch hunt "
cybersecurity expert @entity146 : the media are only as good as their contributors .
