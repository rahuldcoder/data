-- going to the beach has become a lot like looking for hotel accommodations : if it has a one - star ranking , you know you 're in for nothing but trouble			0
a new report released today by the @entity11 ranked the water quality of 200 @entity14 coastal beaches using a five - star guide , and the results are far from a day at the beach			1
@entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , is one of the @entity11 's five - star beaches for water quality			1
" @entity28 , 7 percent of beach water samples are so contaminated with human or animal waste that they 're not conducive for swimming , " said @entity24 , co-director of the @entity11 's water program and lead author for the report			1
" for the fourth year in a row , @entity11 found that there were more than 20,000 beach closings last year because of human or animal waste in the water			2
" pollutants found in beach water are frequently the result of storm water or sewage overflow , and it 's not something to take lightly , especially if small children , pregnant women or the elderly are spending time in the surf			1
swimming in polluted water can lead to ear infections and stomach viruses , as well as more serious diseases like meningitis and hepatitis , @entity24 said			0
the @entity54 sets a standard for beach water quality , and when water quality tests reveal that pollution has exceeded that standard , the beach is closed			1
" the problem , " @entity24 said , " is that it does take 24 hours or longer to produce test results , " meaning if the beach was contaminated on thursday , you wo n't know about it until friday			0
and once those results are produced , there 's no guarantee that the cause is identifiable			0
while storm water and sewage are often the culprit for closures , for 62 percent of the 20,000 beach closures that occurred last year , the cause of the pollution was unknown			2
but with precious few weeks of beach season left , now is not the time to avoid sand and surf like the plague			0
thankfully , not all beaches are polluted equally -- the @entity11 hands out five stars to beaches that meet health standards more than 95 per cent of the time and quickly notify beach goers with signs and @entity89 alerts when there 's a potential problem			2
standout states include @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , which boast having pristine , nearly pollution - free shores			1
virginians however should take note : @entity99 in @entity100 is certainly not one of those			2
according to @entity24 , this beach is considered to be one of the worst offenders , particularly because it consistently fails more than 25 percent of its water quality tests			1
hands down , one of the best beaches is @entity110 , @entity111 , which does well year after year because of its clean water and strict water quality monitoring , two factors that earned the popular @entity116 beach five stars			1
in nearby @entity93 , @entity119 and @entity120 beaches also earned a stamp of approval from the @entity11			2
@entity123 and @entity18 are two of @entity20 's five - star beaches , but stay away from @entity126 and @entity127 , which both failed more than 25 percent of their water quality tests in 2008			1
if you 're in the @entity131 and looking for quality beach time , strongly consider booking a trip to one of the coasts			0
" from 2005 to 2008 , the @entity131 consistently tested the dirtiest			0
in 2008 , 13 percent of beach water samples violated public health standards , " @entity24 said			1
but no matter which beach you frequent , five - star or not , you should always take precautions by avoiding beaches with obvious sources of pollution , like nearby open pipes and trash			0
wait at least 24 hours after a heavy rain before hitting the waves again , allowing potential pollutants to dissipate			0
