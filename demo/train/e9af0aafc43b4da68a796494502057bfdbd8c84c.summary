@entity0 -- @entity3 's prime minister monday called for reforms in the country 's slow - paced judicial system as a key measure to fighting corruption as he discounted the notion that a citizen ombudsman alone can eradicate deeply - entrenched graft			1
prime minister @entity12 told a management institute in @entity14 in eastern @entity3 that his government though was open to dialogue with campaigners demanding an anti-corruption watchdog with sweeping powers			1
his comments came as 74 - year - old activist @entity22 's hunger strike entered its seventh day at a large protest site in @entity0 , packed by thousands of supporters			1
@entity22 has set august 30 as a deadline for parliament to pass a bill drafted by members of the civil society to create a @entity30 , or citizen ombudsman			1
the campaigner rejects the government 's version of the legislation already tabled in the elected national assembly , saying it 's too weak			2
in his speech in @entity14 , @entity12 reiterated that his government believed concerns over the proposed law should be conveyed to lawmakers and a parliamentary committee scrutinizing the @entity30 bill			2
" we are open to a reasoned debate on all these issues , " he remarked			0
@entity12 , however , disagreed that a @entity30 could become the ultimate solution to tackling corruption			1
" the creation of the @entity30 as an institution will help			0
but it will not solve the problem			0
it needs to be supported by improvements in the pace and quality of judicial processes , " he said			1
the @entity3 leader suggested speeding up @entity3 's justice system , notorious for its sluggishness and how long it takes to settle lawsuits			1
" speedy trials and timely judgments will do a great deal to discourage corruption and dispel the notion that those who break the law can get away scot - free			2
this requires a number of judicial reforms , " he said			2
meantime , @entity22 continued his fast at @entity0 's @entity76 , a day after he made a rare appeal to his supporters to hold sit - ins at the homes of lawmakers until they agree to the civil - society draft of the @entity30 bill that the government has not accepted in full			1
@entity0 's police spokesman @entity85 told @entity1 that officers had removed demonstrators surrounding houses of elected leaders from different locations in the city			0
there were no detentions , he said			0
police had no immediate details about how many protesters had gathered outside the homes of parliamentarians after @entity22 's call			1
in his dramatic comments sunday , the elderly campaigner also described public gatherings as superior to the federal assembly			0
" ... the people 's parliament is over and above @entity0 's parliament			0
it is this people 's parliament that has created that ( elected ) parliament , " @entity22 said			1
some observers , however , disapproved of the activist 's protest tactics modeled after hunger strikes of @entity3 's independence leader @entity115 as he fought the @entity117 rule			2
" mr. @entity22 is well within his rights to hold protests			1
but to say , ' you accept my bill and nothing else , ' might amount to coercing the government and parliament , " constitutional expert @entity120 said			0
he , however , described @entity22 's support base as a clear indication of public disaffection with chronic corruption			1
" i think most of the people may ( not know ) what @entity30 or @entity133 bills are and about their implications			0
they have hit the streets because they are frustrated with this corruption and also with the government 's handling of the whole issue , " @entity120 said			2
nonetheless , he warned that democratic bodies should be allowed to work in accordance with laid - down norms			0
" in the name of corruption , you can not demolish democratic institutions			2
you can not throw the baby with the bath - water , " @entity120 said			0
experts also believe the @entity153 nation is required to carry out a range of reforms to overhaul its systems			0
" corruption is a systemic problem			2
a lokpal may be curative , but it ca n't be preventive as far as corruption is concerned			1
we need systemic , administrative and , above all , political and electoral reforms , " @entity120 added			0
on saturday , a leading civil - rights activist , @entity165 , echoed similar views on @entity22 's campaign			1
" i think ( @entity22 ) is ill - advised			1
anyone who says , ' my view should be the only view , ' is wrong , " said @entity168			0
" we must assert our rights			0
but to get rid of these ( democratic ) institutions would be a great disaster for all the people in this country , " she warned .			0
