two @entity0 and a @entity1 won the @entity2 in chemistry this year for their work on optical microscopy that has opened up our understanding of molecules by allowing us to see how they work close up			1
the winners are @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , the @entity15 committee in @entity16 announced wednesday			1
back in 1873 , science believed it had reached a limit in how much more of a detailed picture a microscope could provide			0
at the time , microscopist @entity21 said the maximum resolution had been attained			0
this year 's winners proved that contention wrong			0
@entity25 goes to scientists who perfected led light " due to their achievements , the optical microscope can now peer into the nanoworld , " the committee said			1
the importance ca n't be overemphasized : now , scientists can see how proteins in fertilized eggs divide into embryos , or they can track proteins involved in @entity40 's or @entity42 's diseases , the committee said			0
hell , of the @entity43 , @entity44 , and @entity45 , @entity46 , both in @entity1 , developed a way to use two laser beams to make individual molecules glow on and off			0
speaking to the @entity15 committee by phone after the prize was announced , @entity12 said the development of nanoscopy was " very important to life scientists " because the use of focused light is the only way to see how the body works at a cellular level			2
he said he was " totally surprised " by the call from the @entity15 committee and that it took a while for the news to sink in			1
@entity11 , of the @entity65 , in @entity66 , @entity67 , and @entity13 , of @entity68 in @entity69 , worked separately to develop the basis for single - molecule microscopy			1
@entity72 goes for work on cells that form brain 's gps system this uses light to make individual molecules glow and allows a dense super-image to be resolved at the nanolevel			0
committee chairman @entity81 said that thanks to their development of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy , cells could be studied close up and the boundary between chemistry and biology had blurred			2
" @entity90 has turned into hard facts and obscurity has turned into clarity , " he added			1
last year 's prize in chemistry rewarded three scientists , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , for work leading to the computer programs used today to predict the outcomes of very complex chemical reactions .			2

committee head : " @entity90 has turned into hard facts and obscurity *...* into clarity "
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 *share* the @entity2 for chemistry
their work has *shifted* optical microscopy boundaries into the nanoworld
@entity12 says he was " totally surprised " to *receive* the call that told him he *'d* won
