-- in @entity1 , @entity2 , on the night of june 21 - 22 , 1964 , @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 went missing			1
their bodies would be discovered in an earthen dam 44 days later as the ultimate payment for their efforts to secure voting rights for all @entity13			1
yet 50 years later , it 's as if it barely happened			1
a right - leaning @entity16 has decimated the @entity17 , the very law inspired by the deaths of those three young men			1
their rulings have given the ok to conservative legislatures and governors nostalgic for the @entity25 to reinstitute roadblocks to voting			1
what happened to learning from history ? you might remember this case was the basis of the 1988 movie " @entity40 , " which starred @entity34 as a crusading @entity36 agent bent on getting to the bottom of killings by the @entity39 , though it 's hardly historically accurate			1
" the movie i love to hate , " @entity42 , @entity5 's brother , told me from @entity44 last week			2
" it makes out the @entity36 as the hero ( yet ) the @entity48 felt that the @entity36 was the enemy and was working with local law enforcement ( who were klan members ) much more than the movement			2
" @entity54 's sister , @entity53 , also decried the portrayal of a " hero @entity36			2
" " tell me about it , " she said from her home in @entity58 , @entity59			2
" if all of that had been invested , it would n't have taken 44 days " to find the bodies			2
or even longer if two of the missing men had not been white			1
@entity5 and @entity4 were white and @entity67 from @entity44			2
@entity54 was a black @entity68			0
in a bitter irony of what the three men stood for , it was the notion of white lives being more valuable than black that helped bring their deaths to national attention			1
" it 's no secret that had my brother not been with @entity5 and @entity4 , we would not have known anything of what had happened to him			0
it 's a painful reality , but it is common knowledge , " @entity53 said			0
" we would n't be talking right now if it was only @entity89 or if it was three @entity2 black people			1
there were many people that had been killed in @entity2 beforehand , and with the exception of @entity95 never made the @entity96 , never made @entity97			1
nobody ever mentioned their names			0
" @entity5 had arrived in @entity2 earlier that spring			1
teaming up with @entity54 , he immediately raised the ire of the @entity39			0
" he was targeted from the moment he arrived , " @entity53 said			0
" you know the nature of hate : ' let me first make sure i degrade you to the degree in my mind that you are less than human			0
' there 's nothing less than human for a white man to be than a ' n --- -- lover			0
' once that 's established , then anything goes			0
" @entity4 joined them on june 20 , 1964			1
they were riding in a blue @entity120 station wagon the next day when a deputy sheriff stopped them			0
" it is sad , heartbreakingly sad , that @entity126 's first day in @entity2 was the last day of his life , " @entity53 said , her voice going quiet			1
what were they doing that so outraged the good old boys ? aside from just being black and white together , their major work was voter registration , at the time barred to black people unless they could answer impossible questions such as how many bubbles are in a bar of soap			0
an @entity36 investigation did lead to the federal conviction of seven conspirators in the case			0
@entity2 did n't get around to prosecuting the case until more than 40 years later , when @entity39 leader @entity146 was convicted and sentenced to three maximum 20 - year terms for the murders			1
the killings fueled passage of the @entity151 in 1964 and the @entity17 the next year			1
yet much of that progress was turned back in 2013 when the @entity13 @entity16 gutted crucial provisions of the @entity17			1
it followed that in april with a ruling against affirmative action efforts in higher education			0
part of the justices ' argument was that federal actions to assure equality at the ballot box have been successful , so they 're not needed anymore			0
but that 's like saying a car rolls well with wheels , so you can take them off			0
and proof that it does n't work is that as soon as those enforcement measures were lifted , voter restrictions returned in the form of less - than - logical voter id laws			0
one of those allows prospective voters to present gun registration cards as acceptable proof of eligibility , but not student ids , attorney general @entity181 said in december			0
is that any less ridiculous or subjectively discriminatory than asking voters to count bubbles in a bar of soap ? yes , the arc of the moral universe is long and may bend toward justice , but it also makes a couple of back flips along the way			1
" we 've certainly made some progress , " @entity5 said of where the country is now , a half century after the murders			2
" on a scale of 1 to 10 , if you started at 1 when @entity200 came down in 1954 , we might be at 4 now			0
" for that , three men gave their lives .			2

@entity206 says 50 years after the murders in @entity2 , history *repeats* itself
three young men were killed in 1964 while trying to secure voting rights for all
today , the @entity16 and conservative *statehouses* are turning back the clock
