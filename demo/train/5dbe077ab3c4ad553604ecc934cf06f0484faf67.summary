-- like many other @entity2 , i was overwhelmed by the news of the @entity4 which was set off from @entity5 in @entity6 late december 2011			1
thousands of youths walked for almost five days , covering more than 250 kilometers by foot			1
the youth used the term @entity4 to denote a continuation of their revolutionary protest and a rejection of the immunity given to president @entity16			2
they wanted the whole international community to notice that what is happening in @entity2 is in fact a revolution , not just a political crisis			1
in this spirit , they wanted the world to seriously consider their demands to topple @entity16 's regime completely and start building the civil and democratic country they all aspire to have			2
when the youth started their march , they knew that it might involve many risks and dangers that may have threatened their lives			1
it was not unrealistic that thugs and snipers loyal to @entity16 could inflict heavy casualties on the marchers			0
however , the marchers slowly shed these concerns as they climbed the mountainous roads along the cities of @entity46 and @entity47 on their way to @entity49			0
their march surprisingly grew in size as youth from cities joined in			1
however , they were received at the entrance of the capital of @entity49 and some of its streets with a fierce attack by @entity16 's loyalists and thugs			0
early reports stated that at least 13 protesters died and dozens more were injured as troops opened fire on the @entity65 - style mass peaceful protest			0
that was the way @entity16 and his associates decided to show their hospitality to the exhausted and fatigued marchers			0
yet the revolutionary youth of @entity71 in @entity49 rushed to defend them against @entity16 's forces and to lead them to the square which was set as their final destination			2
that was where they gave them a warm welcome and later celebrated them as heroes of the nation			0
as the marchers overcame the risks and troubles they faced , the march 's meaning evolved and came to represent a new turn in the course of @entity2 's revolution			1
from one perspective , the march revealed the true depth to which the @entity98 youth have contributed to the success of the revolutionary protests			1
what surprised the world the most about the @entity103 was not the unpredictability of events , but the level of civility utilized to achieve success			0
the @entity4 is just one example of the youth 's determination to shape the arc of @entity2 's future without guns , violence or bloodshed			1
@entity2 is experiencing two revolutions , says female activist despite the bravery shown by the marchers , and their commitment to non-violence , the media has largely remained silent on the first march from one city to another			1
the media simply circumvented the march by tabbing it is a " peaceful rally " falling drastically short of what it really was			2
it is difficult to understand why the event did not receive the coverage it deserved			0
the march broke the typical cliches of @entity2 as a country of bombs and terrorists and , if covered , could have shown the whole world that @entity2 is an army of liberation -- demonstrating hope for all those who seek freedom but lack the means to achieve it			1
the march was a symbol for the historical new trajectory of the @entity98 world			0
the area is witnessing a birth of a new generation that has broken the shackles of oppression and submission			1
by realizing the universal rights of a life of dignity and freedom of choice , this new generation is eager to shape its future and build a country of its own volition			0
the autocracy of oppression that has permeated the @entity98 world will never find its way into the history of the @entity98 as long as youth exist			2
how @entity98 youth found their voice youth have sacrificed their lives for the success of the revolution , and now should not be the time to undermine them and the role they will play in shaping @entity2 's future			1
youth have always been at the heart of the uprisings : they were the first out on the streets to demonstrate , the least likely to be intimidated , most likely to raise their voice against authorities			0
they have received enough criticism			0
it is now time to join them in their marches and celebrate them as the heroes our country needs			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2
