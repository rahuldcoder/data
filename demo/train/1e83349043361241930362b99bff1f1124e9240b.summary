@entity1 , @entity0 -- in a world of celluloid action stuffed with @entity6 fights and sci - fi gadgetry , thank heavens for @entity9 , the amnesiac assassin who 's so lethal that he can turn a hardback book into a weapon			1
the only foe who 's come anywhere close to trouncing the resourceful hero was @entity15 , the @entity16 super-assassin sent to @entity17 to despatch him in 2007 's " @entity18			1
" action actor @entity19 says the days of martial arts beefcake with no acting skills are over			1
he 's one of a new breed of multi-talented actors who can act as well as fight			1
it 's a classic fight in a series celebrated for gritty realism and great stunts			1
@entity9 , played by @entity29 , and @entity19 's @entity15 throw each other around the room with primal ferocity : you wonder how they did it without injuring each other			1
@entity19 ( @entity36 ) puts it down to being a one of a new breed of stunt actors who can play parts just as well as they can fight			1
he talks to " @entity41 " ( @entity41 ) about the the stunt tricks that allowed the @entity9 team to create unprecedented realism and still be around to tell the story			1
video : @entity19 explains the secrets of a great on - screen fight ( @entity41 ) : your big break came in 2007 when you played @entity15 in the " @entity18			1
" how did that come about ? did the fact that you were able to do your own stunts help ? ( @entity36 ) : by then i had been acting full - time for about four years			1
i had also auditioned for the casting director of " @entity9 " in the past			2
i had obviously done something right since he remembered me			0
my role included a big fight against @entity29			1
it is the fight of the movie			1
there were several rounds of auditions			0
the first round was physical -- to see if you could ride a motorbike and do choreography			0
then there was a dramatic audition and another round for the director			0
they did n't realize the full extent of what i could do until i got the role			0
the fight was n't going to look like that if someone else got the role			1
the flip out of the wrist lock was my idea			0
i took hits that most people would n't take and performed moves that had n't been done before			0
it was a great opportunity to showcase something			1
( @entity41 ) : the fight scene in " the @entity18 " is incredibly violent and visceral			1
how did you make it look so real ? ( @entity36 ) : that 's a good question			1
you see a lot of fight scenes that are uninspiring , but the " @entity9 " films are known for their gritty realism			2
@entity29 's @entity9 is a very everyday type of character , so the fighting has to be very real			1
i remember telling the fight coordinator that we had to make this the best fight scene in the franchise			2
we rehearsed and collaborated to get some great stuff			2
when i met with @entity29 for the first time i was like , " we have to get to go all out			1
" the choreographer , @entity113 -- he 's done films such as " @entity116 " , " @entity117 " , " @entity118 , " " @entity119 " -- was one of my favourite choreographers , so working with him was great			1
the choreography itself was brilliant , but it 's also how you fill it out with reactions			2
actors are n't used to action , so they double - up for painful scenes or they wo n't be able to film them in such a brutal way			1
but the good thing about @entity29 is that he is very rough and ready			1
the fight took six 13 - hour days to film			1
( @entity41 ) : you said that you were willing to get hurt			0
can you talk a bit more about that ? ( @entity36 ) : my ethos is that it is an art form			0
if your character is going to take a beating , then you do too			0
for example , the book scene where @entity29 picks up a book and rams it into my throat , smashing me into the cabinet -- the book was squishy but the core was solid			1
we messed around to see if i could hold the book and make it look like he was hitting me			0
in the end i said , " @entity29 , just do it			1
what is the worst that can happen			0
" and he was like , " are you sure ? " so we go for it and we hit the [ cabinet ] so hard the doors come off			0
but when we looked at the playback we knew we got it			0
( @entity41 ) : do you see yourself as part of a new breed of action actors ? ( @entity36 ) : during the 80s , films with modest budgets would get cinema distribution and the stars would have predominantly action - orientated backgrounds			1
now audiences demand a higher standard of acting			0
gone are the @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 ... the muscle - bound action hero			1
the modern action hero is @entity182 in " @entity183 " or ... good actors like @entity185 , @entity29			1
if you reach @entity187 's level you will get something really engrossing to watch			2
that 's a new breed and i want to be in that niche			2
do you prefer muscle - bound tough guys like @entity193 or modern action heroes like @entity29 ? ( @entity41 ) : you played a ninja in " @entity196			1
" did you have to audition to become a stuntman on the film ? ( @entity36 ) : yes , there was an audition			2
i was cast as one of the @entity203 -- the group of ninjas who trained on the mountain camp where @entity209 's character trains @entity210			2
[ the audition ] was at @entity211 [ in @entity1			0
] we had to do solo performances to show our skills			0
then we did choreographed sword work -- alone and in a team			0
they make you jump through hoops but it was good because my friends and i got on that film together and we had a good laugh			2
( @entity41 ) : how did you first become a stunt actor ? ( @entity36 ) : well , my story is quite interesting			2
i started off young , when i was doing a lot of theatre			0
i caught the martial art bug aged nine and have trained in martial arts , tae kwon do , ninjutsu , capoeira and got into acrobatics			1
then i stopped acting for awhile			0
i thought i could get into showbiz			0
maybe with these physical skills i 'd have a quick route in			0
so originally , i thought i 'd work as a stuntman			0
that 's what i began working towards and ended up working on " @entity196 " and when i decided i wanted to pursue an acting career and do my own action in my films			1
( @entity41 ) : was it a big transition to go from the acrobatic and martial arts to the skills you have to use as a stuntman ? ( @entity36 ) : yes			1
but you can tweak your training to be more stunt - focused			2
the real difference between martial arts or real combat and screen fighting is that real fights are shorter			1
but in on - screen fighting you want to extend everything so the audience can see the extension of your techniques			1
so , a lot of moves are exaggerated			0
and then there are reactions			0
in action you have to be able to deliver good technique and give good reactions , because reactions make your opponents ' actions look more powerful			2
( @entity41 ) : what does it take to make it as a stuntman ? ( @entity36 ) : in @entity274 , to make it as a stuntman , ideally you want to join the @entity277 and the @entity274 @entity278			0
to do that you have to be qualified in six disciplines , such as swimming , horse riding , gymnastics , car racing , martial arts , boxing , fencing			1
you must also have 60 days of paid work in front of a camera			0
( @entity41 ) : do you think it is hard to break into the stunt industry ? ( @entity36 ) : it is			0
over here it 's a very closed shop			2
if anything , they almost go out of their way to scare off new people because there are already a lot of stuntmen or women and not enough work			0
it 's like jumping through hoops to get on the register			2
so , it will take anywhere from three to five years to become qualified			0
and it will cost you thousands to do it			0
( @entity41 ) : do you think that stuntmen are the unsung heroes of @entity313 ? ( @entity36 ) : yes , in a big way			0
moments in the greatest action films and even non-action films are created by very skilled stuntmen			2
what gets to me is the credits -- there 's just a block of stuntmen 's names			2
so you do n't know who did the stunt			0
in " @entity329 " you want to know the name of the stuntman who leapt off a building in @entity333 and hung onto an airborne helicopter			0
there is lobbying for the @entity336 to have a category for stuntmen .			0
