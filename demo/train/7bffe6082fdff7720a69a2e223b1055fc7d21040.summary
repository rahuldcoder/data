@entity0 -- a former @entity3 sergeant is facing conspiracy charges in a federal sting operation that focused on a team he allegedly supervised in what the team thought was international drug trafficking and planned killings , according to the @entity13 attorney in @entity14			1
@entity16 , 48 , led a " security team " of former soldiers from around the world to assist people he believed were @entity19 narcotic traffickers , federal authorities allege			1
in fact , the " traffickers " were @entity13 informants , according to federal authorities			1
@entity16 , along with @entity27 , 42 , an @entity13 who also served in the @entity3 ; @entity29 , 27 , a @entity31 national who served in the @entity31 armed forces ; and two other men acted as the security team that surveyed the transportation of what they believed to be illegal drugs by @entity19 dealers			1
the men acted as " contract killers " who planned to eliminate anyone who threatened the drug trade -- including law enforcement agents , a press release from the @entity13 attorney 's office said			1
specifically , authorities said in a friday news release that the men planned an assassination in @entity53 " for a six - figure payday , " targeting a @entity13 @entity56 agent and a person purportedly cooperating with the @entity56			2
the killings apparently never took place			0
@entity16 , @entity27 and @entity29 are each charged with separate counts of conspiracy to murder a law enforcement agent , conspiracy to kill a person to prevent communications to law enforcement , conspiracy to import cocaine into the @entity13 , and other drug and gun related charges , according to federal documents			1
each count carries a maximum penalty of life in prison			0
the story as spelled out in a federal indictment starts in early 2012 when @entity16 believed he had made contact with @entity19 drug traffickers			1
@entity16 recruited a team of four individuals to assist the " drug traffickers " he had met , collecting his alleged team members ' resumes via e-mail , the indictment said			0
@entity16 told his men that they could expect to see " tons of cocaine and millions of dollars , " according to the indictment			0
the men @entity16 thought were @entity19 traffickers " were in fact confidential sources for the @entity56 , " according to the indictment			2
" @entity16 spoke with the ( confidential sources ) about serving as the head of security for the ... purported @entity19 drug trafficking operation , and @entity16 provided ... resumes for the individuals he had selected as prospective members of the security team , " the indictment said			1
5 law officers among 70 charged in @entity103 drug trafficking bust from there , the indictment tells a complex story that @entity14 @entity13 attorney @entity106 compared to the work of a well - known spy novelist			1
" the bone - chilling allegations in today 's indictment read like they were ripped from the pages of a @entity114 novel , " @entity106 said friday			0
" the charges tell a tale of an international band of mercenary marksmen who enlisted their elite military training to serve as hired guns for evil ends			1
" the indictment details how the defendants traveled to various countries in @entity125 , @entity126 and the @entity127 and met with the government 's confidential sources -- apparently the same unidentified sources @entity16 believed to be @entity19 traffickers -- as they allegedly discussed various criminal enterprises			1
the meetings were recorded by the informants , according to the indictment			2
there are references to talks among the alleged team members about " bonus work , " which @entity16 explained meant assassinations , the indictment said			0
" @entity16 explained that he had in fact previously committed acts of violence for pay -- including , among other things , arranging for the murders of two female real estate agents , " the indictment said			0
but the indictment did not elaborate on those purported killings or say where or when they supposedly took place			0
@entity106 said at a news conference friday that those two killings claimed by @entity16 in his talks occurred outside the @entity13 and " there is corroboration for the allegations in the indictment			2
" he did not elaborate beyond that statement			0
the group 's work with the confidential informants took them to @entity161 , where in late march , according to the indictment , the team provided " counter-surveillance " to make sure local officials did not know about boats that were being loaded with what team members believed to be cocaine			2
a similar scenario played out in the @entity170 in late june , with the team -- again working with the government 's informants -- providing surveillance during the loading of an airplane with what they thought was cocaine , according to the indictment			0
the alleged plan to kill a @entity56 agent and a " snitch " was elaborate , the indictment said , including meetings in multiple countries with the actual killing to take place in @entity53 -- chosen so their passports would not be stamped			0
according to the indictment , the men requested several guns , including submachine guns , pistols and silencers , as well as latex face masks that would make them appear to be of a different race			0
@entity16 was arrested in @entity161 and was expected to arrive in @entity0 on friday evening			0
he is expected to appear before a @entity13 magistrate judge in @entity14 federal court saturday			1
@entity27 and @entity29 , who also were arrested abroad , were brought to @entity0 and were in court thursday afternoon			0
the two other men involved in the scheme were arrested on wednesday in @entity199 at the request of the @entity13			2
according to the indictment , @entity16 served in the @entity3 from 1983 to 2004 , attaining the rank of sergeant first class			2
he led multiple squads , served as a sniper instructor and trained soldiers in marksmanship @entity208 : a forgotten front in @entity13 's drug war ? @entity1 's @entity211 reported from @entity0 , @entity212 wrote from @entity213 , and @entity214 in @entity0 contributed .			1
