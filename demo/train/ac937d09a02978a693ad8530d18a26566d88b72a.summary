-- the founding fathers are frequently quoted in the gun control debate , but many of those quotations turn out to be fake			2
the most popular comment on a recent story about gun control featured a purported quotation from @entity9			1
more than 2,000 votes pushed it to the top			2
" when governments fear the people , there is liberty , " reads the quotation			2
" when the people fear the government , there is tyranny			0
the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is , as a last resort , to protect themselves against tyranny in government			0
" the same quotation has been posted dozens of times in other readers ' posts			1
some readers worked to debunk it by mentioning @entity35 , the @entity37 's website , which has a section devoted to " spurious " quotations that have been attributed to the third president of the @entity41			1
the website lists several variations of the quotation , featured on two pages , and says staff " have not found any evidence that @entity9 said or wrote " those words			1
former @entity49 share dramatically different stances on gun violence @entity52 , a commenter who said he teaches @entity41 government to high school students in @entity57 , @entity58 , described feeling a responsibility to educate young people about the need to develop a discerning eye about the information they come across			2
@entity52 was one of the readers who mentioned that the quotation had been debunked			2
he suggests starting with a @entity68 search , which often will quickly turn up information about a quotation			0
" many of these quotations are circulated and reposted on social media or appear in chain e-mails , " he said via e-mail			0
" every time i see one of these bogus quotes , i call it out as fake			0
" for others , the message of the quotation rings true even if the quotation is n't entirely accurate			0
a commenter named @entity85 from @entity86 , @entity87 , said he read through the @entity37 page , but he is n't ready to declare that the comment is fake			0
" i do not know if @entity9 actually ever made such a statement or not , ( but ) i find it odd that many people attribute it to him if it was n't true			1
it 's ridiculous in my opinion to propose that since nowhere in his writings there is trace of such a statement , then @entity9 has never said something like that			1
@entity9 could have come up with those words in any occasion of his public or private life and someone else recorded and then quoted him			1
" @entity0 decided to look at the reasons why apparently fake quotes can be so popular			0
many have an underlying message			0
a recent @entity113 privacy hoax inspired users to share faux copyright legalese with all their friends			2
in the words of one worried @entity113 poster , " it may have been a hoax , but it did not hurt ! " the sentiment of the post text was important , regardless of where it originated			0
then , even more recently , actor @entity125 found himself in a quotation controversy regarding comments attributed to him about last month 's school shooting in @entity130 , @entity131 , that left 20 children dead			1
the statement , which blamed the media for sensationalizing the tragedy , spread on social media			0
" he neither wrote nor posted nor had any knowledge of it , " @entity125 's publicist told @entity138			1
still , @entity125 's star power helped propel a provocative idea			2
likewise , @entity9 's words appear to have also been in great demand since the @entity130 shooting			1
the @entity35 site techs have recorded an uptick in traffic to their quotations area since early december			0
spokeswoman @entity151 sent along statistics indicating traffic increases of nearly 1,000 % on some of the remarks , and especially on the " spurious " quotes			0
several of these quotations have appeared in @entity0 comments			2
@entity158 , research librarian at the @entity159 , said there are extensive records of @entity9 's writings and communications			1
just about every quotation from @entity9 can be documented somehow , she said			1
the earliest reference to the " tyranny in government " quotation that @entity158 has noted thus far is within a 1989 opinion - editorial about gun rights from the @entity171 in @entity172			0
she said the first part of the section of the article where the quotation appears , which begins with " no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms , " has been verified			0
but the rest of it has not been found in @entity9 's writings			1
@entity158 said there are often clues that help identify quotes from @entity9 , such as the vocabulary of his time and the typical sentence styles he used			1
over time , @entity158 added , a researcher gains a keen sense for these discrepancies ; @entity9 composed mostly written communication rather than text meant to be spoken			1
" @entity9 was very wordy , and a lot of the quotes i see are very snappy , " @entity158 said			1
" they sound like they were maybe composed by a 20th century speechwriter			0
" @entity151 said @entity37 's keepers do n't want to get caught up in the political debates about gun control , but there is a lot of community interest in @entity9 's real and falsely attributed quotations , so @entity207 researchers provide resources based on searches through electronic and physical archives of @entity9 's writings			1
@entity212 , an attorney and author of the book " the @entity216 ' @entity215 , " said he does n't understand why someone would want to use a fake quotation			0
" for years i 've seen bogus quotes on gun issues in the @entity221 , " he said			0
" since the @entity222 were so positive on @entity215 rights , i could n't understand why anyone would feel compelled to invent quotes			1
" @entity212 said @entity9 was a big supporter of the right to own firearms			1
" @entity9 wrote the @entity228 , and served two terms as president , " he said			1
" he personally possessed numerous firearms for hunting , target shooting , collecting , self - defense and defense against tyranny			2
he deemed being armed the mark of a true citizen			0
the @entity239 was won by an armed populace against the @entity242 standing army			0
" the @entity244 website includes quotations from the founding fathers , but has pages for debunked and reliable remarks			0
site creator @entity249 said the quotes help explain the @entity252 's meaning			2
" there are politicians , scholars , jurists , and others who do n't believe the @entity215 was intended to preserve and guarantee an individual right to arms outside of active militia duty , " @entity249 said			0
" some go as far as to claim firearms ownership was solely a collective right			2
" he said the quotes show that the @entity215 was intended to protect not only a " vigorous individual right " but also " to serve as a check against an usurpation of our government			0
" @entity270 , a professor at @entity271 , said some quotations may need context , especially those from the " losing side " of debates			0
he added that he believes both sides of the gun conversation tend to oversimplify the @entity222 ' historical intent			1
" without being too professorial about it , " he said , " depending on what theory of the @entity252 we use , you can get very different interpretations of the @entity215			0
" @entity270 , who is the @entity285 and @entity286 in @entity287 at the school , said the @entity252 incorporates lessons learned while the nation was under the @entity291			0
he said the turmoil of @entity293 stirred up fears of mob rule among many leaders			0
he also compared the militias of early @entity41 to a form of taxation , saying that citizens had what @entity9 referred to as a " right and duty " to be armed			1
that is , they were required to buy weapons in addition to being allowed to possess them			2
militia membership was often compulsory , @entity270 said			0
he questions whether the @entity222 would have welcomed the idea of people taking up arms against their newly hatched constitutional government instead of using governmental procedure to settle differences , which sometimes is referred to as the " ballots vs. bullets " debate			1
the @entity9 quotation 's emphasis on battling the government caught the attention of reader @entity322 , a gun owner and @entity215 supporter from @entity86 , @entity87			1
" i do n't think the sentiment is out of line with @entity9 's thinking in view of his other verifiable statements such as ' a little rebellion now and then is a good thing , ' etc. , " he said			1
" yet i think @entity9 would reject the ultraright modern day belief that armed rebellion will be needed in the near future against a socialist , unconstitutional federal government			1
" @entity322 said he feels there is a need to avoid extremist views and added that he believes most people have a nuanced perspective on guns			2
he expressed a desire to define " that ragged line between civilian and military weapons			2
" " exactly where that line gets drawn is something that @entity41 should think about , argue about , and then vote their convictions , " he said			0
" i think the vast majority of @entity41 and mr. @entity9 would agree with me			1
