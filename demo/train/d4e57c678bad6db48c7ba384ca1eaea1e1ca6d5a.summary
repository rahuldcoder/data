-- for 12 bloody , horrific months , @entity2 dissidents and many world leaders have dreamt of one outcome for the @entity2 crisis : the ouster of president @entity7			1
but who would take over the embattled country remains a mystery -- one that could be fueling the bloodshed that has already killed thousands			1
@entity15 , a @entity2 - born scholar at the @entity16 in @entity17 , said foreign leaders may be reluctant to take stronger action against the regime because no one knows who would come to power			1
" i think the international community would like a scenario that would be as clear as possible : who would they be dealing with ? do they have a vision for the future ? or will it be total chaos ? " @entity15 said			0
" so this uncertainty is prolonging the life of the regime -- uncertainty both shared by @entity2 sitting on the fence inside @entity2 and in the international community			1
" exactly who would lead @entity2 , he said , depends on how @entity7 leaves			1
a military coup as remote as it may seem , @entity7 's downfall could come in the form of an internal coup , said former @entity47 ambassador to @entity2 @entity48			1
" in many ways , this would be the best outcome because there would be regime change , " said @entity48 , director of @entity50 's @entity49			2
but staging a military coup with high - level defectors may seem like a pipe dream -- one that could have deadly consequences			0
" when generals get together , there are usually other generals looking over their shoulders , " @entity15 said , making it difficult to carry out a rebellion among top officers with unanimous support and without retaliation			0
in recent weeks , opposition activists have reported dozens of defected soldiers killed at the hands of the regime			0
yet " if the @entity7 regime collapses violently , it is most likely that elements of the @entity77 , along with others , take over as an interim government , " @entity15 said			1
the @entity77 the @entity77 -- an opposition coalition whose leadership resides outside of @entity2 -- has gained recognition from the @entity47 , @entity82 and other countries as a legitimate representative of the @entity2 opposition			1
@entity86 , adviser to the president of the @entity77 , says his group already has a plan for a @entity91 era			1
first , a presidential council would be formed in the transition phase to handle all affairs related to sovereignty , he said			0
in addition , a transitional unity government would include opposition figures , representatives of revolutionary committees and " members of the regime who have no responsibility in crimes or major corruption , " @entity86 said			1
that transitional government would oversee the organization of elections to designate a @entity109			1
the assembly would be tasked with drafting a new constitution , a political party law , and a new election law , and would oversee parliamentary and presidential elections , @entity86 said			2
but some analysts are skeptical about the @entity77 acting as an interim administrator			1
" there 's a lack of coordination amongst the insiders , and they represent the outsiders , not the insiders , " @entity48 said			2
" it 's not a coherent opposition leadership			2
" the current president of the council , @entity126 , is based in @entity128			2
other leaders are based in the @entity47 , @entity130 or elsewhere			0
and footage of some protesters in @entity2 shows demonstrators proclaiming , " @entity126 , you do not represent us			2
" the @entity77 has also taken heat from some @entity137 activists for not pushing harder on the international stage to help arm rebel fighters			1
but @entity86 disputes the notion that the coalition is full of expatriates			0
" the @entity77 's majority of members are based inside @entity2 , but many of those names are not made public for their safety , " he said			1
" the @entity77 is a broad - based coalition of political , religious and ethnic blocs added to the majority of grass - roots and revolutionary members from the coordinating committees			2
" yet even if the @entity77 becomes a facilitator while a new government is formed , it 's uncertain who would lead that group at the time of an @entity7 ouster ; the @entity77 presidency has a term of three months			1
a rebel military leader although numerous armed opposition groups emerged after the government 's crackdown started , a top military defector from the @entity168 announced last week that rebel forces have united under the leadership of the @entity171			1
the @entity171 , comprised largely of @entity7 soldiers who have defected , is led by @entity173			0
but @entity15 does n't think the rebel army 's commander would be a shoo - in to lead @entity2			1
" there is the expectation of further defectors of the army -- maybe defectors of a higher rank than col. @entity173 , " he said			2
@entity182 is commanding the @entity171 from @entity183			0
but @entity15 said there are no big names among rebel ranks inside @entity2 that are emerging as possible interim leaders			1
" the @entity7 regime has been particularly good at exiling , arresting or even killing charismatic leaders , " he said			0
" so there is n't one obvious leader			2
" the vice president then there 's the possibility of @entity2 's vice president taking power after an @entity7 downfall			1
" the opposition , at first , talked about vice president @entity199 as interim president ... but this is becoming highly unlikely " as the carnage and anger mount in @entity2 , @entity15 said			1
" the vice president has been left in a very weak political position			1
he has a very small staff , he does not control anything			0
he does not influence anything in @entity2 decision - making , " he said			2
" if the @entity7 regime collapses , he will collapse			0
" but @entity48 says the vice president could still come into play , and the @entity213 could still exert influence			1
" if something happens to @entity7 , and the @entity217 and @entity218 still remain in power , a vice president might still be in power			1
the family would still rule , " @entity48 said			0
@entity223 's younger brother @entity222 commands an elite division of the @entity2 army and is accused of widespread human rights abuses			1
his cousin @entity227 is the richest man in @entity2			1
the @entity213 is @entity218 , an offshoot of @entity229			0
@entity2 's @entity218 minority has long dominated the @entity2 government , despite a @entity233 majority in the country			1
but " even if someone from the regime takes over power , there is simply no going back to business as usual , " @entity15 said			0
" this revolution has gone on too far , too long , and it has been too bloody			0
... so @entity2 will be opening a new page			2
" how would @entity7 go ? getting rid of the current regime means much more than just ousting @entity7			0
it means uprooting 42 years of al - assad family rule			0
@entity213 , the president 's cousin who is now a @entity2 opposition activist in @entity130 , said @entity7 is " too scared to step down			1
" " i think he 's very scared of the people around him and the different security apparatus , " said @entity213 , founder and director of @entity247 in @entity2			1
" his father built the state			0
his father rose ( through ) the ranks of the army			2
he had all power in his hand , " @entity213 said			0
he inherited all those people , he does n't control them			0
" " it looks like the only way to get rid of that regime , " he said , " is you have to pry away people around @entity7			0
" another possibility , @entity48 said , is the president could go into exile			2
@entity269 -- the cradle of the @entity272 uprisings and the first clountry last year to oust its longtime ruler -- has offered asylum to the @entity2 president in an attempt to spare further bloodshed			1
and a cache of e-mails leaked to @entity0 indicates the daughter of @entity283 's emir has suggested exile in @entity285			0
but @entity7 leads a dynastic regime that shows no sign of backing down			0
" i think they 're living in their own world of perception , and there 's an aspect of delusion , " @entity48 said			0
to be objective , he said , the president still has support from the power elite , @entity218 and other minorities " that are scared to death if he leaves , there 'd be sectarian war			2
better to live with the devil we know then than the devil we do n't			0
" @entity15 acknowledges that if dissidents manage to oust the @entity7 regime , " there would be a very rapid mood change " among those proclaiming support for @entity7			0
" ( but ) most of these people you are not talking about , they are simply very , very fearful of what happens next , " he said			0
" they would prefer stability at any price instead of the unknown			0
i think when the unknown becomes the order of day , the @entity7 regime is past them , there will be a new mood , and they will smell the smells of freedom			0

the uncertainty over who would take over could be fueling the bloodshed , some say
the @entity77 has a plan for *building* a transitional government before elections
an expert says neither the vice president nor a rebel army leader is a likely successor
