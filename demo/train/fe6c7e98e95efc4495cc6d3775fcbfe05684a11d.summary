-- arguments over the massive overhaul of the health care system -- which congressional @entity4 hope to pass by next month -- are expected to keep shaking up the country long after the vote			1
@entity8 ' plan could be the first legislation of its kind passed along strict partisan lines			2
in modern history , legislation of such scope -- including @entity14 in 1935 and @entity15 in 1965 -- has had at least some support from the opposition			0
" the bottom line is that , unlike other major legislation which has passed with more bipartisan support , health care is going to remain a political football , and people are going to have a sense that it is not fully settled yet for a while , " said @entity19 , a senior political analyst for @entity0 who also worked in the @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 administrations			1
" it 's sign of the unhealthy quality of our politics that a bill this significant in our social history is passing with only one party in favor , " he said			1
@entity42 , an expert on @entity8 and legislative politics with the @entity44 , said that in the past two decades , @entity45 and @entity4 have become increasingly polarized			1
" it just seems that the incentive to disagree seems to be growing , " she said			0
because of the ideological polarization , the parties are growing further apart in policy terms , and thus reaching across the aisle is becoming a tougher task , @entity42 said			1
the polarization , coupled with another development in recent history -- partisan team play -- has contributed to the heightened partisan rancor surrounding the health care debate , she said			1
partisan team play is more about keeping a party cohesive and opposed to the other party than it is about underlying policy , she added , comparing this session of @entity8 to the 103rd , the last time @entity4 controlled @entity8 and the @entity65			1
there was a " whole slew of @entity4 initiatives in ' 93 - 94 where @entity45 said , ' we 're not going to vote for these , ' " @entity42 said			1
@entity70 , a congressional analyst and lecturer , said that with the current health care legislation , there was never much hope for bipartisanship , because the divide between the parties over the role and size of government intervention is " a pre-existing issue			2
" " once you grow government to tackle any major societal problem , it is doubtful you would be able to bring any @entity45 aboard , " she said in an e-mail to @entity0			0
no @entity45 supported the bill passed in the @entity88 , and the @entity65 version received just one @entity45 vote			1
before a final bill can be sent to president @entity94 's desk , the two versions must be merged into one and voted on again			2
senior @entity4 sources say that a traditional @entity65 - @entity88 conference committee is unlikely to meet to work out differences , because that would allow the @entity45 to slow the progress in the @entity88			1
@entity4 leaders from both chambers may instead circumvent the traditional process through informal , high - level talks , the sources said			1
most @entity104 disapprove of the current health care legislation , according to @entity0 's most recent polling			0
" in addition to the polarization that already exists , there is deep polarization in the country about the bill itself on the merits , " @entity19 said			1
" there may be instances , but i ca n't think of them , when a major piece of domestic legislation has passed in the teeth of public disapproval			2
" @entity70 , who spent several years as a congressional staff aide , pointed to the 1980s for an example of the risks of acting on legislation without public support			0
@entity8 passed the @entity125 in 1988			2
the legislation was intended to expand @entity15 to protect seniors against catastrophic medical expenses			0
to pay for it , enrollees saw higher monthly premiums and a surtax			0
senior citizens became livid when they fully understood its impact , @entity70 said			0
@entity4 rep. @entity136 of @entity137 championed the legislation , which was enacted with the help of the @entity140			2
@entity70 recalled that angry voters booed the congressman and pelted his car with eggs			0
the law was repealed in 1989			0
" in the battle of the spin wars to come on the health care bill , no one should underestimate the public 's reaction once the impact of the bill 's provisions become clearer and , if enacted , actually felt , " @entity70 said			2
still , it 's an important historical win for @entity94 if he signs the health care bill into law , @entity19 said			1
" what the @entity65 hope would be is that over time , people would come to appreciate it			2
people will adjust and find that the benefits of the bill far outweigh the negatives and that it will be a major plus for his party over time			0
right now it 's not , " he added			0
debate over the legislation will play a key role in the upcoming midterm elections , with @entity4 pushing its benefits and @entity45 slamming its costs			1
" it 's pretty clear at the moment that unless opinion swings in favor of the bill , as it may , then @entity45 will run against the reform in 2010 elections and probably in 2012			0
and that will present the prospect that over time they can change it , " @entity19 said , noting that even some @entity4 have said they intend to change the bill over time			1
but in order for @entity45 to make gains at the polls , it would take a " delicate balancing act " since those gains would likely come from independent voters , said @entity45 strategist @entity196			0
independent voters are fiscally conservative and wary of the massive price tag attached to health care reform , but they also do n't like partisanship , she noted			0
anticipating some conservative democrats losing in this year 's congressional elections , @entity70 said she thinks the @entity65 is knowingly sacrificing some members of its own party in exchange for what the administration believes will be a seminal accomplishment			1
@entity0 's @entity209 and @entity210 contributed to this report .			0
