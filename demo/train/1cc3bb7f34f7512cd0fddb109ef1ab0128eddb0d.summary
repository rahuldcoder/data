-- the man who made @entity3 's bravest comeback has given his seal of approval to @entity7 's dramatic decision to return to @entity8			1
@entity9 -- whose return from life threatening injuries has been immortalized this year in the @entity14 film " @entity15 " -- won his second world title for @entity8 in 1977 , just one year after the fiery crash that almost took his life			1
when asked by @entity0 's @entity19 what he made of @entity7 's renaissance for @entity8 , @entity9 , a man who does not mince his words , said : " very good			1
" it 's the right decision by [ @entity8 president @entity26 because @entity8 has been behind @entity27 on the last four world championships , which does n't make him happy , " added @entity9			1
the @entity31 three time world champion also predicted the arrival of the ambitious @entity34 driver will give a " kick " to current @entity8 driver @entity36 -- a suggestion the @entity38 denied ahead of this weekend 's @entity39			1
interactive : the @entity19 's guide to @entity42 the @entity44 team will field the sport 's most potent driver line up in 2014 , pairing @entity7 with @entity36 , the man they replaced the @entity49 with for the 2010 season			1
@entity7 raced to @entity8 's last drivers ' world title in 2007 while the @entity38 has two world titles , won with @entity54 in 2005 and 2006 , on his resume			1
pairing two ambitious world champions on opposite sides of the garage is a risky move			0
it is also a departure from @entity8 's policy of running a @entity64 driver -- a role @entity36 held for the last four seasons -- with a driver playing a supporting role			2
@entity7 has replaced @entity69 , who famously handed victory to @entity36 at the @entity72 when the team implicitly employed team orders by telling the @entity75 over the pit - to - car radio : " @entity36 is faster than you			1
" @entity9 predicts @entity7 's arrival will be a wake up call to @entity36 -- and one that should make the 32 year - old raise his game			1
" with @entity69 and @entity36 it was very clear that @entity36 was the @entity64 , " @entity9 commented			2
" with @entity7 coming there , it will kick @entity36 to go quicker			1
" they are strong characters			0
it will need strong leadership from the top of @entity8 to keep them under control but for the team itself to suddenly get going , this was the right decision			1
" @entity9 speaks with some authority			2
" @entity15 " adramatizes his arch rivalry with flamboyant @entity95 driver @entity94 and the @entity31 is now drawing on his own experiences of managing on track rivalries as a non executive chairman of the @entity100 team			2
the 64 year - old was instrumental in persuading 2008 world champion @entity102 to partner @entity103 at @entity100 from @entity104 for the 2013 season			1
@entity102 's move was also considered to be a risk but it has paid off as he won the @entity108 @entity39 , while @entity104 is yet to score a podium , and @entity103 has also claimed two race wins			0
@entity9 says pairing two talented drivers within the same team has helped @entity103 and @entity102 push harder			2
" i got @entity102 last year , i convinced him to join the team and he made a hell of a difference , " @entity9 explained			1
" suddenly you have two drivers pushing each other and [ who ] have a good relationship , this is the most important thing			0
" @entity36 does not necessarily agree with @entity9 's assessment			2
the @entity38 told reporters in @entity42 ahead of this weekend 's grand prix that @entity7 's arrival in 2014 will do little to change his work ethic for @entity8			1
" the motivation will be always similar , " he said			0
" i will do my best all the time			0
i do n't think anyone will push me more than i push now			0
" two world champions - i do n't think that makes any difference			2
" money problems for @entity7 @entity7 spoke to the media for the first time since being unveiled as a @entity8 driver and also rejected suggestions that he and @entity36 would not be able to work together in 2014			1
" i do n't see the reason why it would n't work , " said the 33 year - old			0
" we are all old enough to know what we are doing			0
" if there is something , i 'm sure we can talk it through			0
it 's not like we are 20 year - old guys any more			0
" i might be wrong -- time will tell -- but i 'm pretty sure everything will be good			0
for sure there will be hard fights on the race circuits , sometimes things go wrong ... i 'm pretty sure it will all be ok			0
" the @entity34 driver , not known for his effusive answers when talking to the media , also revealed he decided to leave the @entity154 at the end of 2013 because he is owed money by the team			0
" the reasons why i left from the team is purely on the money side , that they have n't got my salary , " @entity7 explained			0
" it 's an unfortunate thing but like i said , i want to try and help the team as much as i can and i like to race			0

@entity9 says @entity8 has made a " very good " decision by *signing* @entity7 for 2014
the three - time world champion says it will also provide a " kick " for @entity36
he warns managing @entity7 and @entity36 in 2014 will take " strong leadership "
@entity9 says bringing @entity102 to @entity100 made " hell of a difference "
