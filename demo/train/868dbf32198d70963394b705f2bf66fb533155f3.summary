in the azure waters off the rocky coast of @entity4 , a remote island in the @entity5 with a population of less than 50 , an international team of archaeologists has recovered new treasures from one of the most mysterious shipwrecks of all time			1
the group of maritime archaeology experts have been at the site since mid-september and armed with the most advanced marine technology available , they have conducted the first - ever scientific excavation of the @entity4 wreck			1
despite facing fierce winds and choppy seas during the 30 - day mission , the reclaimed items include tableware , anchors and other maritime components , as well as a giant spear , which they believe once belonged to a life - sized bronze warrior statue			1
the recovered artifacts have been described as " very promising " by project co-director @entity29 in a press release from @entity31 ( @entity31 )			1
the @entity32 - based @entity31 worked with @entity29 and the @entity33 in @entity34 to lead the expedition			1
he added : " we have a lot of work to do at this site to uncover its secrets			1
" @entity42 's first computer found at wreck in 1900 , sponge divers from the @entity34 island of @entity46 anchored along the eastern coastline of the island while waiting for a ferocious storm to pass			1
what they would stumble upon would stun the world			2
underneath the crystalline waters , lay the incredible wreck undiscovered for thousands of years			1
and as the site was explored over the next year , they would uncover life - size bronze statues and remarkable artifacts			1
but it was the 1902 recovery of a clump of calcified stone with mysterious inscriptions that would push the wreck into archaeological lore			1
the heavily corroded bronze fragments would turn out to be what has been described as the world 's earliest known " computer , " designed in the first century @entity68 -- the @entity69			1
built to track the astronomical calendar and lunar movements , later radiographic image analysis of the mechanism revealed 30 intricate gear wheels			2
famed underwater explorer @entity75 visited the site in 1976 to film a documentary and returned from below the surface with treasures galore			1
since then , the site had remained dormant under the aegis of the @entity83 for almost 40 years			1
" the @entity4 shipwreck is maybe the most important , most famous shipwreck from antiquity , " @entity84 , an archaeologist from @entity31 and co-director of the expedition told @entity7 before the dive began in september			1
" we are hardcore scientists and archaeologists			2
we hate to speak of treasure but in this case , it 's actually a treasure ship and there are just no two ways about it			2
" shrouded in mystery analysis of the reclaimed artifacts has dated the vessel to the first century @entity68 , while a horde of gold coins retrieved from the water suggests the boat 's origins lie east , from @entity107			1
but no one knows for certain how big it is , what it was doing there or why it went down			0
@entity84 said : " this not just an everyday trader			0
this is probably one of the largest , most expensive ships that was sailing in the first century @entity68 the 1901 sponge divers reported that the artifacts were spread among an area about 52 meters along the seafloor			1
and that corresponds nicely with what we 've observed in our dives on the site			1
" supported by the @entity125 , @entity84 and his 32 - man team have been provided with research vessels capable of raising artifacts weighing up to five tons straight off the seabed			1
" you never want to speak about absolutes or guarantees but i 've never felt more confident in a shipwreck that there is going to be something interesting on it , " @entity84 said			0
" in the 1901 and ' 76 operations , they were getting gemstones , gold stones and human remains			1
and human remains almost never come up from ancient shipwrecks			1
so with modern ancient dna analysis , there are all kinds of questions that can now be posed if we recover some			0
" with the location at around 55 meters deep , it 's not particularly hard to get to			0
@entity84 explained : " this shipwreck is close to the shore			0
it 's only about 70 meters off the cliff face so it makes it very difficult to bring in a big ship to support any kind of robotic systems so we came up with a plan and have been putting it into practice over the last three years -- incrementally training on new technology so that we could get and do very vigorous science			0
" at the most basic level , if we can come away from this important shipwreck site with a very , very good map and a much better understanding of the layout of the wreck , from that data we can begin to pose new questions to drive forward the research , " explained @entity84 , who has worked with the @entity163 in @entity34 for the last decade			1
the international expedition started by mapping out the site using " @entity175 , " an autonomous underwater vehicle ( @entity177 ) from the @entity178			1
the @entity177 conducted a high - resolution survey of the wreck site to create precise @entity182 documentation of the expansive debris field			1
meanwhile , technical divers equipped with metal detectors scanned the seafloor to determine the extent of the wreckage under the sediment before test trench excavations were able to begin			2
underwater " @entity191 " the team also arrived in @entity34 with a next - generation diving suit that could revolutionize the future of ocean exploration			2
looking like something straight out of " @entity191 , " the @entity197 is an atmospheric diving system , created by @entity201 - based @entity200 , originally designed for offshore exploration of oil fields			2
repurposed for the expedition , @entity84 explained it offers the team extensive bottom time at the site			2
" the system itself for the @entity197 has life support for something like 40 hours if all went to hell			2
i mean , really , it 's when you get tired and sore , and want to have a sandwich and use the toilet , that you come up , " he said			0
and the best part is the simplicity of the technology , revealed its creator @entity222			0
" you can literally operate the @entity197 after a few hours of training			0
the majority of the training is spent in emergency drills			0
but the actual functioning of it is as simple as learning to drive a golf cart , " said @entity222 , a pioneer in deep - sea exploratory technology			2
" the suit is controlled by footpads that can tilt forward , backwards or from side to side			0
" aside from @entity197 's ease , @entity222 also highlighted how the suit negates some of the side effects of conventional saturation diving , like decompression sickness and prolonged , unnecessary dive times			0
" in the @entity197 , you jump into it and the compression time is zero			0
you 're down to 1,000ft within 10 minutes and you can spend six to eight hours there and then come back in 10 minutes instead of 10 days			0
" but for the dive team , it 's the opportunity for exploration that is the biggest pull of @entity197			0
" we figure by the end of the first two days with @entity197 , we 'll have more time on the @entity4 shipwreck than any other dive put together that 's gone before it , " said @entity84			0
a doomed dowry ? it 's been a mammoth undertaking and with a bill at over â‚¬ 2 million ( over $ 2.5 million ) , the team was hoping the @entity5 would yield some of its secrets			2
prior to this scientific dive , the archaeologists had little to go on and were left to come up with theories based on the little historical evidence at hand			0
when human remains -- including a skull that was 80 % intact -- were recovered in ' 76 , a treasure trove of jewelry , perfume bottles and other female - related trinkets were found close by			1
" one of our pet theories is that maybe this ship was carrying a really wealthy woman from @entity107 , and she was going to be married and this cargo was her dowry			0
it 's impossible to prove but it 's a nice romantic notion , " said @entity84			0
with such a long passage of time between when the ship sank and the present day , and so many unanswered questions , the scientists and archaeologists expect to be working on the project for at least the next five years			0
and it 's a journey @entity84 is excited to have embarked on			0
" i like to think of shipwrecks as books , books in a library			0
the seafloor is a vast library and with every single shipwreck , there is a book telling us about the past and the artifact that we raise is like a page in that book			0
" so if we want to try to recreate the ancient past and figure out who we are , who we came from , why we live in this modern world , then the only way to do that is to look at the physical remains of past cultures			2

divers have recovered new items from 2000 - year - old wreck site
items found include a bronze spear from a life - size statue , tableware and anchors
co-director @entity29 : " we have a lot of work to do at this site to uncover its secrets "
earlier dives returned with gems , gold , life - size statues and human remains
