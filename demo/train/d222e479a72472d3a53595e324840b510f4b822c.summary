" we hope he can give us a better picture of what was going on at this company			0
" in court thursday , may admitted to tipping off mine managers that inspectors from the federal @entity40 were on their way , allowing them to clean up hazards like poor airflow and piles of loose coal that would have led to citations and fines			1
he also admitted to falsifying safety records and telling miners to rewire a device that monitored flammable methane gas levels , allowing mine equipment to run illegally , prosecutors said			2
" people who run coal mines have a fundamental obligation to be honest with mine regulators , " @entity28 said			0

the @entity6 explosion was the worst @entity19 mine disaster since 1972 , when 91 men died in a fire at the @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79			1
in a december report , @entity40 found a methane ignition that set off flammable coal dust was the immediate cause of the 2010 explosion , but it also blamed the " unlawful policies and practices " of @entity12 , which it said " promoted and enforced a workplace culture that valued production over safety			1
" @entity12 kept two sets of books to mislead federal inspectors and its own workers about hazards in the mine , and had twice as many accidents as it reported to regulators , the report concluded			1

the deal includes payments of $ 1.5 million to each family that lost a member in the @entity6 mine			1
an earlier state investigation found the mine lacked adequate ventilation ; water sprays on equipment were not properly maintained and failed to function as they should have ; and the mining company did n't meet federal and state safety standards for the application of rock dust , a crucial tool in keeping highly volatile coal dust from exploding			2
@entity12 -- whose former ceo , @entity126 , was an outspoken critic of federal regulators -- disputed that report , saying the blast probably occurred when natural gas flooded into the mine			1
