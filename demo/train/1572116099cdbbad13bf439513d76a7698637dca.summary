@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 declined an invitation to attend a major gathering of social conservatives this week in @entity0 , opting instead to make a high - profile appearance at a forum organized by former president @entity9 in @entity10			1
@entity2 's decision was hardly a bombshell : up for re-election in november in a @entity16 - leaning state , the governor can hardly afford to be seen courting @entity18 conservatives and sharing a stage with divisive figures like @entity21 and @entity22			1
but his absence was a sore point for many conservative activists who traveled to the @entity26 's " @entity36 " conference to see a bumper crop of @entity29 stars , including would - be presidential candidates like @entity32 sen. @entity31 and @entity34 sen. @entity33			1
in @entity37 , early signs of the 2016 presidential race the official line here about @entity2 was a polite one			2
" he was invited , " conference organizer @entity43 told @entity1 in an e-mail when asked about @entity2			2
" we would have been happy to have him and our hope is he can come next year			0
" but in conversation after conversation at the forum , attendees offered opinions of @entity2 that ranged from bewilderment to thinly disguised contempt			1
taken together , their assessments signaled that @entity2 has some vital repair work to do with conservatives if he wants to pursue the @entity29 presidential nomination in 2016			1
while many here seemed unfamiliar with the details of his policy positions , most were fully aware of @entity2 's public embrace of president @entity66 in the wake of @entity68 , which ravaged the new jersey shore last october			1
@entity2 's gushing praise of the president 's post-storm relief efforts rankled a number of @entity76 's top campaign advisers , some of whom blamed him for burnishing @entity66 's image just days before the presidential election			1
the whispered complaint among top @entity29 in and out of the @entity76 campaign was that @entity2 was disloyal , more concerned with his 2013 re-election bid than with helping a @entity29 capture the @entity86			1
at the @entity26 and @entity89 event , it was clear a similar perception about @entity2 has taken hold among party activists , many of whom said they would n't dare vote for him if he decides to seek the 2016 @entity29 presidential nomination			1
" he 's changed , " said @entity99 , a @entity29 activist from @entity100 , @entity101			1
" he was a rock star at first when he first came out			0
he was making good speeches and being very conservative			0
he went against the teacher 's unions , which is a good , free enterprise issue			0
and he stared them down			0
now he is showing his other side			2
" @entity99 , who said he was surprised @entity2 was even invited by the @entity26 , paused in the middle of an interview and looked at his companion			1
" was he a @entity114 before he was a @entity29 ? that 's a good question			1
it would n't surprise me			0
" @entity118 , another @entity101 and a self - described home - schooling mom , expressed disappointment that @entity2 chose to attend a forum hosted by @entity9 instead of spending a day in @entity0 meeting with conservatives			1
@entity9 lauds @entity2 " i am disillusioned with him , " @entity118 said			1
" i see too much two - facedness , trying to ride both sides of the fence for his own gain			0
i 'm not sure what he is right now , with the way he philanders with a variety of people , democrats like @entity9			2
what does that tell you ? " @entity138 , a 23 - year old @entity139 student from @entity140 , @entity141 , said @entity2 " is not very popular here			2
" " nobody is excited to support him at all , " @entity138 said			0
" nobody that i know of			0
" @entity2 has riled the right in other ways beyond the drama of @entity68			2
his list of perceived sins , documented by right - leaning bloggers and curated online by the conservative @entity150 , seems to expand by the week			0
in february , the governor complied with an expansion of @entity153 required under @entity66 's health care reform law , a smart political move in a blue state but a poke - in - the - eye for conservatives rabidly opposed to the provision			1
he has sought tougher gun laws in @entity3			2
and earlier this month , after the death of @entity3 sen. @entity162 , @entity2 called for an expensive taxpayer - funded special @entity164 election instead of appointing a @entity29 to serve out the remainder of the @entity114 's term in @entity0			1
still , many of the conference - goers had only a dim awareness of @entity2 's record in @entity171			1
their impressions seemed based on casual conversations with friends and neighbors , and rooted in the @entity68 episode last year			0
asked specifically what it is about @entity2 that turns off conservatives , @entity177 said " the buddy buddy with @entity66 thing			1
" " the way he buddied - up to him does not play well with true bedrock conservatives , " said @entity184 , a communications strategist from @entity0 who said she personally admires @entity2			1
admittedly , these are the opinions of only a modest sample of the most dedicated social conservative activists , including a good number of evangelical @entity18 who might be more sympathetic to a candidate like former sen. @entity196 , who won the 2012 @entity198 caucuses with support from influential pastors , or @entity202 gov. @entity201 , the son of a baptist minister and a practicing evangelical			0
but there is harder evidence that @entity2 has problems with republicans outside of @entity3			1
a @entity209 poll released earlier this month pegged @entity2 's approval rating among national @entity29 at just 58 percent , and almost a quarter of @entity29 view him unfavorably			1
" this may reflect that @entity29 are paying close attention to @entity2 's overall political positioning , and some in the party may be displeased with @entity2 's high - visibility public appearances with president @entity66 in the aftermath of @entity68 at the new jersey shore , including one just before last november 's presidential election , " @entity209 pollster @entity213 wrote about the poll			1
getting a thumbs - up from nearly two - thirds of national @entity29 might not seem like a problem for @entity2			1
but politicians -- especially those who hope to survive the obstacle course of a presidential primary fight -- are generally expected to have deeper appeal within their own party 's ranks			0
@entity234 , for instance , has a 94 % favorable rating among @entity16 , @entity209 recently found			0
the picture in @entity3 , where @entity2 is expected to cruise to victory in november over @entity16 challenger @entity239 , differs markedly for him			1
almost 90 percent of @entity29 in the state view their governor favorably , according to a @entity245 - @entity244 poll released on friday , and more than 80 percent of @entity3 voters think @entity2 will be re-elected			1
and yet not a single person among the more than two dozen conference - goers interviewed thursday and friday named @entity2 among their top choices for president in 2016			2
the names that most frequently surfaced were those of @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity201 , who , like @entity2 , were absent from the gathering			2
@entity255 : why 2014 is the year to watch a number of conservatives here said flatly they would never vote for @entity2			1
" sorry , ca n't go that way , " said @entity259 , a @entity29 from @entity260 , @entity34			2
" he 's not pure enough on the founding principles			0
" @entity264 , a resident of @entity265 , @entity34 , had a similar take			0
" i 've heard he 's in with the president and he supports what he does , and you see him walking around with @entity66 and you see him consorting with @entity66 a lot , " @entity264 said			2
" i do n't know where he stands			0
" @entity275 , a @entity29 activist from @entity276 , said @entity2 has time to repair his image , but she doubts that he will have much appeal in her state , which holds one of the pivotal early presidential primaries every four years			1
" after the election and the things that happened , i think a lot of people probably blame him for it , " @entity275 said			0
" i do n't blame him			0
i do n't think it was his fault			0
but you still hear it from a lot of people			0
the way i look at him is , he sells in @entity3			2
and what you have to be there is a whole lot different than what sells in @entity276			0
i do n't know that he will be popular in @entity276			0
" a few people here had a more pragmatic perspective			0
@entity306 , the 25 - year old @entity307 native , said @entity29 should be willing to support candidates who are n't down - the - line conservatives if they want to win			2
" i hate the argument that if we want to win we have to pick someone who we do n't necessarily agree with , but that 's the world we live in , " he said			0
" so i would rather have @entity2 and have him be my friend half the time , than have a @entity114 as a president			2
i would certainly vote for him			0
" " i do n't think we should shoot for the middle , " @entity306 said , with a pained look on his face			0
" but we need someone with broad appeal , because we 've lost the last two times and we need a win			0

@entity3 's @entity2 's decision to choose @entity9 over @entity26 and freedom forum rankles conservatives
some still blame @entity2 's praise of @entity66 in @entity329 for @entity76 's loss
@entity333 supporter says @entity2 is " showing his other side "
