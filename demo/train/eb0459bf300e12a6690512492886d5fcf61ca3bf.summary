@entity0 -- it 's a large district in and around @entity0			0
it 's not a swing seat ; it 's a safe @entity6 strongholdâ € ” not a nailbiter			1
but in this midterm election , the 13th @entity9 race has attracted some national attention and some rock star fundraisers : @entity13 and @entity14			1
why such attention and star power ? because the candidate is @entity18 : related by marriage to the @entity20 and tied to the former president by history			1
@entity18 first gained national attention 20 years ago			1
she lost her seat as a freshman @entity26 member after voting for @entity29 's 1993 signature economic plan			1
it was about to go down after multiple @entity6 defections			0
he needed one vote ; she was it			0
" i do n't regret my vote , " she said at the time			0
" nor do i apologize for it			0
" @entity29 remained in her considerable debt			2
neither she nor the president could have known then that they would be bound in another way : her son , @entity42 , married @entity43 , who is now expecting their first child			2
and while the @entity20 have raised money for her campaign , they 're not exactly campaign regulars			1
in memoir excerpts , @entity29 honors her mom the political question : how much @entity29 is enough ? " we always knew that if they came in too much we would be blamed for their coming in too much			1
if they do n't come in enough , then people would say they did n't come in enough			0
you 're kind of damned if you do , damned if you do n't , " @entity18 told @entity1			2
" they have done everything we 've asked them to do , and i am running on what i have accomplished in the last 20 years and not on my affiliation with the @entity20			1
" but that 's hardly something she can , or really wants to , escape			0
a campaign ad using @entity29 's appearance on her behalf went up on the air wednesday with him saying " if you send @entity18 to @entity73 she will make you proud ... and this district will be well - served if you elect her			1
" @entity14 is headlining a fundraiser in @entity76 for her thursday evening			2
and her vote to pass @entity29 's economic plan back in the day is a subject she does not shy away from as he campaigns in her old district that was once largely @entity81 , but is now largely @entity6			1
predictably , she 's come under some criticism about how her campaign has used the @entity20			1
one of her opponents , @entity85 , released an ad featuring some of @entity29 's remarks touting @entity18			1
then @entity85 's daughter comes on the screen saying " while some cling to the past , we just ca n't go backwards			2
" how many @entity93 super pacs is too many ? the campaign hopes the @entity20 can gave @entity18 a last minute boost in fundraising and turnout			1
" i want to get one thing out of the way			0
i would be here if her son was n't my son - in - law , " president @entity29 said at a campaign event for @entity18 last month			1
" i 'm not saying vote for her because 20 years ago she saved the economy			1
" she also saved the @entity29 presidency , according to a top former aide , @entity111 € ” and knowingly lost her job			1
" i 'm quite sure he knew that that was a political death knell for somebody who had just won by the narrowest of margins			0
and he was very impressed by that , " @entity117 said of the president 's reaction			0
@entity18 remembers the day of that vote in august of 1993			2
" the @entity81 were high fiving , saying it 's going down , " @entity18 recounted in the interview			1
" a lot of @entity6 were talking about changing their vote			0
" the president called her			0
" he said what would it take ? " she recalled			0
" i said i will only be your last vote			0
i know how important it is			0
" that point was not lost on the president			0
@entity29 and senior @entity26 staff huddled around a small television in an office just off the @entity139			2
they watched @entity141 walk the plank			0
@entity14 steps further into politics with @entity145 fundraiser " republicans stood there and taunted her and said ' bye bye @entity18 , " said @entity117			1
her deciding vote may have saved @entity29 , but she would end up losing her seat the next year			1
in the book of is n't - this - a - small - world , @entity18 is now part of the extended @entity29 family			1
in fact , she and the @entity20 are preparing to be co-grandparents			2
but as voluble as she is on politics , she 's just as silent when it comes to the @entity20			1
when asked about family matters , she becomes downright monosyllabic			0
when asked if she has anything to say about her and @entity14 being co-grandmothers she responded " no. " asked if she and the @entity20 are friends she said " it 's an area that i will not get into , " adding : " they are lovely			1
the @entity20 could n't be any nicer			2
" and when asked what it was like for her son to marry into such a political dynasty , @entity18 told @entity1 " it 's surprisingly normal			1
" that depends on how you define normal			0
as for the race itself , @entity18 has a fight on her hands			2
she 's locked in a tight four - way @entity6 primary despite being the early frontrunner			2
the district is now solidly @entity6 and runs from the affluent suburbs into the blue - collar area of @entity0			0
she campaigns as an advocate for abortion rights and boosting the middle class			0
she has been attacked by opponents for misusing campaign funds which she denies			0
she also got hit for not campaigning aggressively in the early days			0
she has ramped up her schedule and participated in more debates			0
how strong is @entity14 ? @entity188 is attacking her			2

former rep. @entity18 lost her seat 20 years ago after backing @entity29 on *budget*
@entity43 is her daughter - in - law , so she has a unique link to the former first family
and @entity13 and @entity14 are working to help her out in her political *comeback* bid
but there 's a fine line in *gauging* how much of the @entity20 is enough in a political campaign
