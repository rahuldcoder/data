-- some observers have been careful not to name the violence in @entity3 a civil war , lest it become a self - fulfilling prophecy			1
well , the child has to be called by its name			0
the violent turmoil has turned into an asymmetric civil war , where the @entity3 military and pro-government militias on one hand and opposition forces on the other are using extreme violence , not only against each other but also against civilians suspected of being sympathetic to one camp or the other			1
the civil war is asymmetric because government forces are far better equipped , organized and mobilized than the opposition			1
the latest expression of the unfolding brutality of this civil war is the massacre of more than 100 unarmed civilians , half of whom were children , in the @entity33 village of @entity34 , a center of anti-government activity			1
reports are unclear as to whether the culprits were @entity3 military units or pro-government militias , the @entity40 , as they are called in @entity3			2
the @entity41 has also been careful not to point a finger at any side			0
but the @entity41 stand is a result of @entity47 and @entity48 support for the @entity3 government , which compelled the @entity50 to draft a diluted statement acceptable for all members of the council			1
but the kind of weapons , the systematic mode of operation and countless testimonies all point to @entity61 's regime , which is upping the ante in its war against the opposition forces and civilians suspected of being their supporters			1
the civil war is asymmetric for another reason			2
first , although the @entity3 government has been put under extreme international pressure , it still receives unconditional logistical support from @entity72 and @entity73			2
its diplomatic support from @entity47 and @entity48 -- some reports also indicate that @entity47 sends arm shipments to the @entity3 army -- provides assistance for @entity61 's regime to carry on with its onslaught			1
the opposition , on the other hand , does not have the same unconditional international backing			0
although @entity85 and other @entity87 states have committed to support the opposition by arming its forces , their support is not yet a match to the kind of assistance provided by @entity61 's allies			1
other international supporters of the opposition , including @entity96 countries , have been reluctant to take the support a step further and commit themselves to the kind of military operation that brought down @entity101 in @entity102 , or even less so , to the establishment of a humanitarian corridor along @entity3 's borders			1
as long as @entity61 continues to receive regional and international support , his regime will be able to stay in power and have the upper hand in this civil war			1
the civil war is asymmetric for a third reason			2
@entity114 's regime still enjoys a cohesive leadership and is in full control of its military			0
its objectives are also clear -- surviving politically and personally and maintaining control over the country			0
conversely , @entity3 opposition is divided into rival groups that do not share an organized agenda , have different objectives and have been unable to coordinate their efforts			2
so , nearly a year and a half after the start of the uprising , the opposition still does not pose a serious challenge to the regime			0
the @entity41 special envoy @entity133 , who is in @entity134 , was also careful not to put the blame on any side , again reflecting the political dynamics in the @entity41 between supporters and opponents of @entity61			2
@entity133 believes that his six - point plan is still the only workable road map to stop the violence			0
because it is the only plan on the table , @entity133 is probably correct			0
but since the conflict in @entity3 has evolved into a full - fledged civil war , the questions are no longer about political reforms or cooperation between the opposition and the government to stop the violence and rebuild @entity3			1
rather it is the actual physical survival of @entity61 , his family and his supporters			0
it is also about a complete overhaul of the power structure that has been in place in @entity3 for more than 40 years			0
given this bleak reality , the only way to put an end to the violence in @entity3 is by working with those who support @entity61 's regime from the outside			1
@entity47 and @entity48 need to be convinced that it is in their best interest to bring down the regime and that this is the only way to move forward in this crisis			1
once this happens , @entity72 may also be willing to give up on its ally			0
@entity174 is running out , with the beginning of spillover to @entity177 , as indicated in ethnic clashes last week in @entity179 tied to the strife in @entity3			0
it is crucial for the two powers to recognize that with the global leadership that they claim to possess comes responsibility to interfere proactively in such cases of humanitarian crisis			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

@entity190 : it 's time to call turmoil in @entity3 a civil war , with extreme violence on each side
but regime 's forces are far better equipped and organized than the opposition , he says
@entity203 : @entity61 gets heavy - duty support , especially from @entity47 and @entity48
@entity47 and @entity48 must be convinced it 's not in their interest to back @entity61 , he says
