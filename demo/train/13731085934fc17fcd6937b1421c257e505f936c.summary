a promising way to stop a deadly disease , or an uncomfortable step toward what one leading ethicist called eugenics ? @entity7 health officials are weighing whether to approve trials of a pioneering in vitro fertilization technique using dna from three people in an attempt to prevent illnesses like muscular dystrophy and respiratory problems			1
the proposed treatment would allow a woman to have a baby without passing on diseases of the mitochondria , the " powerhouses " that drive cells			1
the procedure is " not without its risks , but it 's treating a disease , " medical ethicist @entity24 told @entity29 's " @entity28 " on wednesday			1
preventing a disease that can be passed down for generations would be ethical " as long as it proves to be safe , " he said			0
" these little embryos , these are people born with a disease , they ca n't make power			1
you 're giving them a new battery			0
i think that 's a humane ethical thing to do , " said @entity24 , the director of medical ethics at @entity44 's @entity43			1
" where we get into the sticky part is , what if you get past transplanting batteries and start to say , ' while we 're at it , why do n't we make you taller , stronger , faster or smarter ? ' " but @entity51 , the director of the @entity52 , said there are no changes to existing genes involved			1
" there is no genetic engineering			0
it is n't a slippery slope			1
it 's a way to allow these families to have healthy children , " said @entity60 , whose organization developed the technique along with @entity64 researchers			2
" what we 're doing is , without at all changing the dna of the mother , just allowing it to grow in an environment that is n't sick , " she added			2
a @entity76 advisory panel concluded two days of hearings into the procedure wednesday			2
the panel discussed what controls might be used in trials , how a developing embryo might be monitored during those tests and who should oversee the trials , but no decisions were made at the end of the session			2
mitochondrial disorders are inherited from the mother			2
in the procedure under discussion in @entity93 , genetic material from the nucleus of a mother 's egg or an embryo gets transferred to a donor egg or embryo that 's had its nuclear dna removed			1
the real reason behind the multiples baby boom the new embryo will contain nuclear dna from the intended father and mother , as well as healthy mitochondrial dna from the donor embryo -- effectively creating a " three - parent " baby			1
in june , @entity111 took a step toward becoming the first country to allow the technique			2
one in 6,500 babies in the @entity111 is born with a mitochondrial disorder , which can lead to serious health issues such as heart and liver disease			0
@entity24 said the same technology could be used to modify an embryo to " making super babies , " a practice he said amounted to " eugenics			1
" " the big issue over the next 5 to 10 years is going to become how far do we go in pursuit of the perfect baby , " said @entity24			1
" do i think we 're going down that road ? yes			0
does it creep me out ? yes			0
are you going to be able to draw a clear line ? i do n't think so			0
" but @entity60 said the procedure is closer to an expansion of in vitro fertilization , which has been available for nearly 40 years			0
" it 's a complicated science , so people need to understand the particulars of the biology and not jump to calling it something it is n't , " she said			0
the last thing she would want , she said , " is for the @entity52 to be involved in anything like designer babies			0
" " i have children and grandchildren , and i ca n't imagine anything worse			0
" record number of women using @entity154 to get pregnant			0

a 3 - person embryo could *circumvent* mitochondrial diseases
the procedure is " not without its risks , " says ethicist @entity24
genes are n't altered in the technique , says a stem cell expert
