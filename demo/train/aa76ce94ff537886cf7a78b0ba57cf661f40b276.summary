-- the parents of a missing @entity5 girl have refused to be interviewed separately by authorities , @entity2 police said wednesday			1
but the attorney representing @entity8 and @entity8 , parents of 11 - month - old @entity8 , said the couple is not opposed to separate interviews , but do not want what police requested -- an unrestricted interview with no attorneys present			1
" being questioned separately is not the issue , " said attorney @entity16			1
she said the couple has been cooperative and has previously been interviewed separately as well as together			1
they do n't mind being interviewed separately as long as the detectives are fair , open - minded and non-accusatory , she said			1
@entity21 was reported missing about 4 a.m. october 4 , after her father , @entity8 , arrived home from work to find the door unlocked , the lights on and a window that had been tampered with			1
the girl 's mother , @entity8 , said she last saw @entity21 at 6:40 p.m. the night before			1
@entity2 police capt. @entity30 said tuesday investigators had planned to conduct the separate parent interviews , but said wednesday the couple had declined			1
@entity30 said he did not dispute reports that the family had cooperated and answered questions , but the police department detectives still had unanswered questions			1
meanwhile , @entity21 's half - brothers , who were in the family 's home the night she disappeared , will be re-interviewed by authorities on friday , @entity2 police said wednesday			1
the boys will be interviewed by a " child services specialist trained to interview kids , " @entity30 said			1
the interview will be non-confrontational , he said , and a police officer wo n't even be in the room			1
" not an interrogation , " he said			0
" they are kids , after all			0
" the boys are 8 and 6 , @entity16 said			0
@entity30 said they were previously interviewed just after @entity21 disappeared , both for under an hour			1
details were being worked out for a re-interview of the boys , @entity16 said			0
@entity58 said in an @entity60 interview last week that she was drunk the night @entity21 disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported			2
the couple said in the same interview they had refused to let authorities re-interview @entity21 's older brothers			1
" they said they heard noises ( the night @entity21 disappeared ) , " @entity58 said			0
" i do n't know if that was before we went to sleep or after			0
" she said she had not talked to her sons about it because she was reluctant to put them through " anything else			0
" the couple 's oldest son is @entity8 's , and their middle son is @entity58 's son , @entity16 told @entity0 in an interview monday			1
" @entity21 was the little girl that was going to hold this family together , " @entity16 said , adding the child was wanted , looked forward to and " well - loved			2
" asked about @entity58 's admission that she was drinking the night @entity21 vanished , @entity16 said @entity58 did what a lot of parents do when their children are in bed -- shared some drinks with a friend			2
" it 's just not that unusual until your life gets turned upside down , " she said			0
authorities had expressed frustration early in the investigation after @entity21 's parents stopped cooperating with investigators , @entity30 had said			2
however , a family spokeswoman attributed the frustration to " miscommunication , " and meetings with the toddler 's parents resumed shortly afterward			2
a cadaver dog searching the family 's @entity2 home indicated a positive " hit " for the scent of a body , according to documents released friday			2
on that information , @entity16 said that law enforcement typically begins such investigations inside the home , then if warranted the probe moves outside the family			0
" we do n't know exactly what happened here , so we need to keep broadening the investigation , " she said , adding she is hopeful that the investigation is going in that direction			0
between 30 and 50 investigators , including police and @entity130 personnel , were involved in the search as of tuesday , the @entity126 said			2
some 900 tips had been received by investigators , the department said			0
surveillance video surfaced over the weekend from a @entity137 gas station less than two miles from the family 's home , showing an unidentified person walking along the road about 2:15 a.m. october 4			1
the station 's manager , @entity142 , said it 's unusual to see anyone walking at that time of night in the area			0
on what @entity21 's parents believe happened to their daughter , @entity16 said , " they do n't know			2
i mean , someone came into their home in the middle of the night and took their beloved child away from them ... they are stumped			0
" she said the couple has provided a wealth of information to police , including the names of people who have had access to their home			0
@entity21 's parents want people to continue looking for the child , she said			0
