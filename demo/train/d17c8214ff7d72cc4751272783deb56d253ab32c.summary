@entity1 rebel leaders in the @entity3 ' troubled south will get access to the lion 's share of the region 's natural resources under a new agreement reached in peace talks with the government			1
the wealth - sharing deal , signed on sunday after eight months of talks , is viewed as a key step forward in the quest for peace with the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , which has fought for decades to set up an independent @entity19 state on the resource - rich island of @entity22			1
progress in the peace process had stalled in the wake of a landmark treaty signed in october last year , which sought to put an end to a conflict that has left tens of thousands dead			2
" for the benefit of @entity31 and the whole country , the government and the @entity17 once more demonstrated that they are invested in the process and will persevere in order to forge lasting peace in @entity22 , @entity36 , the government 's chief negotiator said in a statement			0
the october agreement laid out the groundwork for a new autonomous region called @entity31 that will be administered by @entity1 in @entity22			1
the @entity3 is a predominantly @entity43 country but 5 % of its population is @entity1 , according to the @entity45			1
under the terms of the wealth - sharing deal , @entity1 will get a 75 % share of income derived from the exploitation of metallic minerals in the area -- reported to include gold and copper			1
they will also receive 75 % of tax revenue , while any income derived from fossil fuels like petroleum , natural gas and coal will be split 50 - 50 with the central government in @entity63			1
an end to the conflict could help bring investors to the region , which is reported to have untapped mineral deposits worth $ 312 billion			0
" wealth creation is important for the operation of the @entity31 , considering that the @entity31 territory is among the most underdeveloped in the @entity3 due to the decades - old conflict , " the statement added			2

agreements have yet to be reached on power - sharing and normalization -- which means giving up arms			2
a report published in june by the @entity86 warned that the peace process needed to find ways to support insurgents as they build normal , civilian lives			0
it estimates that the @entity17 has 11,000 to 12,000 fighters			0
" the government has a poor track record of implementing peace agreements and the @entity17 is understandably wary of weakening its formidable firepower too soon , " the report said			0
" secondly , even if it did hand over some guns , these are unlikely to be destroyed , as per international best practice ; military and police would rather keep the good ones , and there is a well - documented history of leakage into the black market from government , " it added .			0
