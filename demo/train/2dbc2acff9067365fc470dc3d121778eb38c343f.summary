when @entity2 visited @entity3 one of the first things he did was measure the level of radiation in his hotel room			1
a @entity8 counter is not usually packed by a business traveller , but well as having a banking industry day job @entity2 is part of a @entity13 - based citizen action group set up to map the radiation levels of cities across the world			1
called @entity18 , the group was founded as a response to the dearth of accurate , comprehensive data on the radioactive fall - out from @entity24 's stricken nuclear reactors			1
read more about @entity26 's recovery from the @entity24 nuclear disaster " the whole idea is to measure everything ( rather than only performing spot checks ) , " said @entity2			0
@entity3 lies just 50 kilometers from a nuclear power station located in @entity32 in @entity34 province , but its 12 permanent radiation monitoring stations are not in heavily populated urban areas			1
on a six - hour drive around the city 's major commercial and residential , @entity2 mapped radiation levels with a portable monitoring kit devised by @entity18			1
all the data is publicly viewable as interactive heat maps on @entity18 's website			0
the drive revealed that @entity3 had a constant level of radiation that hovered around 0.2 microsievert per hour for an annualized dose of 2 millisieverts			1
this was slightly higher than the 0.1 microsievert per hour that @entity18 mapped in the major urban centres of @entity13 and @entity51			2
one millisievert per year is an internationally - recognized nuclear factory guideline for exposure to radiation by the general public , according to dr. @entity56 , radiation expert and physics professor at the @entity59			2
" your risk of having cancer is increased for 4 to 5 % per sievert of radiation your body absorbs , " explained @entity56			0
" the way to control it is to receive as little as possible			0
" on his drive around @entity66 wanted to see how localized the radiation was , " but it seems to be all over , " he said			0
" in @entity13 , you will come across hotspots , sudden spikes in readings , but here you do n't have that kind of concentrated source			2
" more on @entity26 much of the radiation we are exposed to everyday is naturally - occurring â€” produced by the sun , soil , water and rock			1
the @entity81 estimates that on average , people are exposed to 2.4 millisieverts per year from natural background radiation			1
however this natural background radiation did not explain the uniformity of @entity18 's @entity3 findings or the spikes in radioactivity in tunnels			1
it led @entity2 to believe that the common denominator throughout the city , concrete , was a key source of the radiation			2
or more specifically , the locally - sourced granite aggregates used in place of pricier cement to make the concrete			1
" @entity3 is lying on a high - background radiation level because the radionuclide content in the granite in this region of the country is a bit higher than the world average , " said @entity56			1
" there is more uranium and thorium in our granite			0
" a study conducted by @entity56 and his colleagues in 1990 found that the gamma radiation dose rate of local soil to be 1.8 times the world average			2
@entity3 's concrete infrastructure poses no immediate harm to residents ' health , but some wonder if more attention should be given to how buildings are made in the city			1
" when we make concrete , we do n't pay attention to the mineral content of the rock , so long as it is strong enough , " said @entity59 structural engineering professor , @entity125			0
" if it 's really is the case ( that local granite has elevated radioactivity ) , perhaps we should import our granite from elsewhere			1
" the everyday doses of radiation we encounter are far from being fatal in one shot , but it is the accumulated exposure that may be cause for concern			0
according to the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) , there is no direct evidence of ill effects on human health up to an accumulated dose of 10 millisieverts			0
for comparison , a typical dose from a one - hour flight is 0.003 millisieverts per hour , while a 10 - second chest x-ray would expose you to 0.05 millisieverts			0
an accumulated exposure of 10 to 1000 millisieverts may result in an " increased incidence of certain types of cancer , years to decades later ... the incidence of cancer in a population increases with the radiation dose received , " according to @entity142			0
in 2006 , the @entity81 estimated that up to 4,000 cancer deaths would occur among over 500,000 clean - up workers , evacuees , and residents remaining in highly - contaminated areas near @entity165 , many of whom were exposed to doses exceeding 100 millisieverts			0
to reduce everyday levels of radiation @entity18 suggests opening doors and windows to ventilate rooms			2
this minimizes the accumulation of radon - a radioactive gas produced by the decay of naturally occurring uranium and thorium			0
inhaling radon - one of the leading sources of human exposure to natural radiation - in the home and workplace causes tens of thousands of deaths from lung cancer annually , according to the @entity81			1
" what @entity18 is doing provides a context for people to understand radiation , " said @entity2 , producing two photos he planned to contribute to an online photography magazine			0
one was of a snow - covered @entity195 and the other of his seven - year - old daughter			0
" the first photo shows where my family went after the crisis hit @entity13 , and the second shows the purpose of what we 're doing all this for			2

@entity3 's natural background radiation comes from local granite
rock aggregate used in cement for local buildings
radiation was monitored by @entity13 - based citizen action group
levels of radiation in city are not harmful
