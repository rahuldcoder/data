on tuesday , the devastation from last week 's explosions at a @entity0 , @entity1 , fertilizer distributor became more eerily apparent as officials offered new details and opened more roads around the town 's hardest hit areas			1
while the blast 's lethal power was clear , many other questions remain			1
town devastated by explosion is guided by the @entity0 way why did a fire start in the facility , which had shut down to workers for the day ? how did that fire spark the massive explosion that tore through the northern part of town -- killing 14 people , including nine first responders , and injuring hundreds of others ? what , if anything , could have been done to prevent the tragedy ? so far , investigators have eliminated the possibility that natural causes started the fire , but they have n't gone beyond that			1

others kept busy sifting through what remained or trying to fix what they could			0
