@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 shared her story of an abusive marriage in a church - sponsored counseling session in 1985 , @entity3 took her hand to comfort her			1
" and we 've held hands ever since , " @entity3 's wife testified thursday			1
@entity4 , 65 , scanned the room , bit her lip , and breathed heavily as she waited for her testimony to begin			1
when she raised her right hand to take the witness oath , the heavy chain of her shackles appeared			0
@entity4 struck a deal with state and federal prosecutors last year and is serving a 15 - year prison sentence for her involvement in the 2002 abduction of @entity25			1
in spite of @entity4 's agreement to testify , prosecutors in @entity3 's federal trial did not call her to the stand , and she instead began her testimony for the defense thursday afternoon in a @entity0 courtroom			1
in a flat voice and sometimes rambling , @entity4 recounted the start of her relationship with @entity3 ; a journey that eventually led her to the mountainside camp where she watched over a tethered teenage girl her husband said was his chosen bride			1
" i was married to my first husband for 20 years , raising six children , and it was a very abusive situation			0
and i never healed from that situation , " @entity4 said of her first marriage			1
" @entity3 was so supportive of me , he became my best friend , " she said			1
" he said he was abused , also			0
" " we were both going through a divorce , so normally it was n't approved by the church that we date , " @entity4 continued , but she said they received rare consent from leaders at the @entity51 to pursue the relationship			1
the two wed nine months later , on the day @entity3 's divorce became final			1
the first year of marriage , she said , was " hellish , " with a volatile and possessive @entity3 often storming off from their apartment in fits of anger			1
he told her he was " consumed by fear and doubt , " and sometimes simply screamed into a pillow for long periods			0
she struggled through , because of a bishop 's blessing that said @entity69 would do everything in his power to separate the two , but that the @entity73 would give @entity4 the strength to fight back			2
religious counsel and @entity77 readings gave her the remedy : " i started to be more silent , and i learned to be submissive and obedient			1
" also called to testify thursday was @entity79 , @entity3 's younger brother by six years , who described the defendant as an intelligent and resourceful big brother who built model airplanes , devised flying rockets , and endeavored to build a roller coaster in the family 's back yard			2
once , @entity79 recalled , @entity3 constructed a hot - air balloon from cloth and sent it flying ; it landed squarely on top of their home and set the roof on fire			2
as @entity3 grew , he struggled with failed relationships , smoked marijuana and drank			2
that changed one night when the brothers discussed their religious beliefs by a campfire , and the younger one professed his devotion to the @entity103 faith			0
" he became a little bit tearful and said , ' i think what you 're saying is true ' and ' i kind of lost my way			0
' i remember he had a pack of cigarettes and he tossed them in fire and said he wanted to change his life , too			0
" for a time , @entity3 did change , said @entity79 , though his relationships with family members were often strained and laced with suspicion			2
then , @entity4 entered his life			2
" all of a sudden we heard he does n't have a job anymore , and he 's moved up to @entity116 , and he 's living in a trailer up there			0
" after a chance encounter in a @entity0 grocery store sometime later , @entity3 explained he and @entity4 were wandering the country , ministering to the homeless			1
@entity79 expressed his concerns : " i said , ' i think you 're going off on the wrong way , i think you 're drifting away from the church			0
i think maybe you 've been deceived by a false spirit			0
' " their contact was limited after that , until it ceased entirely about five years before the kidnapping of @entity131			0
the brothers encountered each other at their mother 's house , and @entity3 asked to be called " @entity136			2
" his younger brother refused			0
" i just kept calling him @entity3			2
" " i started feeling that this is really starting to look like a mental illness and i sent a letter encouraging him to get some help , " said @entity79 , who works as a mental health counselor			0
defense attorneys are mounting an insanity defense for @entity3 , 57 , hoping to prove that mental illness clouded his mind to such a degree that he did not understand that his actions were wrong when he abducted and held @entity131			1
their case has so far consisted of family members and friends of the defendant , and could include @entity3 himself			0
@entity4 will continue her direct examination friday morning .			0
