-- the @entity2 leaders inside the @entity4 compound in @entity5 may have found solace in the @entity8 debates : though @entity10 was mentioned 53 times , both presidential candidates avoided harsh rhetoric toward @entity10			1
despite @entity8 's repeated avowal to label @entity10 a " currency manipulator " and @entity8 's branding of @entity10 as " an adversary , " both sounded moderate and called @entity10 a partner , which leaves the door open for building a good working relationship with @entity10 's new leaders			1
the candidates traded jabs on how they would deal with the trade and currency issue but skipped other major controversial topics such as human rights , @entity27 and censorship			0
to @entity5 's relief and to @entity32 conservatives ' disappointment , the highly anticipated " @entity10 bashing " was absent from the debates			1
also missing was the big picture -- @entity32 's relative decline , @entity10 's rapid rise and the ensuing power restructuring in the global system			1
is the @entity32 ready to cope with an increasingly powerful , confident and yet non-democratic @entity10 ? the real issue is not whether @entity10 is a currency manipulator or not -- after all , the yuan has appreciated more than 11 % since 2010 and more than 30 % since 2005			2
@entity8 's and @entity43 's narrow focus on trade and currency when mentioning @entity10 , which is understandable due to @entity32 's lackluster recovery , and their dodging of other major problems between the two countries may be misinforming @entity32 who , as a result , do not fully understand the nature of this complex relationship			1
this is a multifaceted relationship , strong but difficult at times			0
the biggest challenge the two countries face is the power transition between them , as @entity10 continues to gallop ahead and is expected to surpass the @entity32 as the largest economy within a decade			1
both countries are struggling to deal with the new power structure in the international system			0
in fact , @entity10 is rising so rapidly that it has difficulty adjusting to its newfound power and sometimes behaves clumsily in international affairs as evidenced in @entity10 's perceived forcefulness in the recent @entity69 / @entity69 dispute and @entity71 controversy			1
@entity32 politicians are used to speaking from a position of dominance			0
both @entity8 and @entity43 claimed they would push @entity10 to " play by the rules			1
" such a condescending approach will not work with today 's more assertive and nationalistic @entity10			0
the @entity32 must play by the rules first			0
for example , @entity79 was recently singled out by @entity81 as a company threatening @entity32 national interests and was essentially declared unwelcome in the @entity32 the telecoms giant has businesses globally , including a recent Â £ 1.3bn investment in the @entity87 which would create 500 jobs			0
in september , @entity8 issued a rare presidential order instructing @entity90 , whose owners are @entity10 , to divest itself of four @entity93 wind farm projects near a military base , citing a national security threat			1
but firms operated by other foreign owners in the same area are apparently conducting business as usual			0
where is the level playing field ? the @entity32 still maintains some @entity103 - era sanctions against @entity10 , including the ban on exports of high - tech equipment and products to @entity10			2
one wonders how the @entity32 can narrow its trade deficit with @entity10 , if it only sells apples and oranges to @entity10 ? is @entity10 friend or foe ? this often - asked question misses the central point that the @entity32 and @entity10 are so interdependent that they no longer have the luxury to make such a choice			2
the two countries are separated by huge gaps in political systems and cultural values , which can be a major cause of conflict			0
the two governments still deeply distrust each other			0
since the @entity8 administration 's implementation of its " strategic rebalancing " toward @entity130 in 2010 , the @entity32 government has failed to convince @entity10 and many other countries in @entity130 that its purpose is not to counter @entity10 's growing power			1
@entity32 's deployment of more forces in the @entity136 and beefing up its alliances with @entity10 's neighbors smack of a policy of encircling @entity10			1
of course containment will not work in this day and age , and @entity130 countries do not want to be drawn into a great power conflict			0
it has become politically incorrect to say anything good about @entity10 during @entity32 's elections			2
candidates tend to compete over who is tougher on @entity10			0
it has become an accepted norm to blame @entity10 for @entity32 's domestic woes			2
such practices may help a candidate to win an election , but they are very harmful to @entity32 - @entity10 relations in the long term			0
the @entity32 is at the risk of creating a resentful @entity10 during the @entity130 power 's transition to a more diverse and open society			1
nothing is wrong with focusing on economic issues now , but @entity32 should never lose sight of the big picture			1
as a global leader , the @entity32 has the moral responsibility to help promote democracy , human rights and rule of law in the world			0
with @entity10 in transition , the @entity32 has a great opportunity to help shape the future of a nation with which it will be politically and economically intertwined for generations to come .			2

@entity8 and @entity43 mentioned @entity10 53 times in the @entity32 presidential debates
their *discussions* of @entity10 missed the big picture : @entity10 's rapid rise
biggest challenge is the power transition as @entity10 gallops ahead , writes @entity185
