-- @entity1 can pinpoint the day she changed the course of her life			1
her friend invited her to a dance fitness class in march 2013			1
@entity1 tried to think of an excuse to skip it , but could n't come up with one so she reluctantly tagged along			1
at this point , the @entity8 , @entity9 , social worker weighed 350 pounds			1
she hid in the back of the room so few people would see her			0
then something unexpected happened : @entity1 really enjoyed the class			2
" the music moved my soul , " she said			0
" even though i felt sure i was going die after each song , i kept moving			2
" growing up , the 5 - foot - 10 - inch @entity1 had always loved music and dance , but had never tried classes or training			1
she was used to being " the biggest person in the room , " and had been all her life			0
" i had become so miserable i did not want to leave my house , " she said			0
at her heaviest , she said she wanted to just " curl up and die			1
" @entity1 began attending the classes twice a week , and the pounds started to drop off			1
@entity1 was especially encouraged after learning that her instructor had lost 100 pounds through dance fitness			1
" when i saw ( the weight loss ) happening i gained a new drive and determination that i had never had before			0
i suddenly knew i could be healthy and have fun in the process			2
" buoyed by her progress , @entity1 , now 43 , started supplementing her diet with protein powder			2
as summer came around , she was attending classes five nights a week , and began " eating clean , " avoiding processed foods			0
as her weight continued to drop , @entity1 's confidence grew			1
by october 2013 , she was down to 250 pounds			0
in addition to her classes , she began three days of high intensity interval training and three days of weight training			2
@entity1 's instructor , @entity49 , began to notice more than a physical change			2
" she went from hiding in the back of class -- very shy , very withdrawn -- to moving to the front of class with a very outgoing and can - do attitude			0
" her mother has noticed the difference too			0
" the results are remarkable , " said @entity58			0
" she is a different person today in body , spirit and attitude from what she was when she began with one visit to a ( dance fitness ) class			1
" @entity1 is now down 127 pounds from when she started			1
she no longer needs to take medication for her blood pressure , depression or anxiety			0
she still hopes to lose 50 additional pounds , which would bring her to her goal weight of 175			1
to that end , she 's started running @entity75 races , and has completed six so far			0
" i am so much stronger than i ever thought possible , mentally and physically , " she said , crediting it all to dance			0
she believes the classes saved her life			0
" if i had not found the dance fitness class that i attend and the supportive group of women there , i believe i would have been either dead by now or so large that i could not leave my home			1

@entity1 credits dance classes for helping her lose 127 pounds
she wanted to " curl up and die " at her heaviest weight of 350 pounds
dance fitness classes showed her she could be healthy and have fun
