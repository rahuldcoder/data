@entity0 -- cars skidded around me , left and right			1
an 18 - wheeler spun its tires and started smoking			1
drivers of other big rigs slammed their accelerators to the floor , trying to get their loads moving across the snow and ice that paralyzed @entity0 tuesday			1
i was surrounded by all this , hoping my mini-suv would n't lose control -- and that none of the other vehicles slithering around in this whirlwind would slam into me			1
i have a wife and four kids to get home to			1
she and my two older children are recovering from the flu			1
there were no rooms available in the hotels by @entity1 downtown , so i left at about 3 p.m. tuesday for the 23 - mile ride to my house in @entity30 , a suburb north of the city			1
it usually takes half an hour			1
after nine hours , i was only halfway home			1
so i stopped , waiting for the traffic to ease			2
when noon wednesday came -- 21 hours after my journey began -- it became clear that " home " was more a wish than a realistic goal			2
i turned around and made my way back to the @entity41 , where i will wait out the rest of this mess			1
i 've never experienced anything like this , anywhere in the world			2
stretches of @entity49 looked like a vehicle graveyard			2
people abandoned their cars -- in some cases on the shoulder , but in others right in the middle of the highway			1
some could n't move in the snow and ice			2
others ran out of gas			2
and some drivers just gave up -- at a certain point , when you 're that exhausted , staying behind the wheel is too dangerous			2
sure , it was boring to be stuck in your car barely moving all that time , but you were n't bored -- because you had to be alert the whole time , for your own safety and that of everyone around you			1
the snowstorm was a great equalizer			2
it did n't matter if you had a late model mustang or a beater van or a @entity79 armored car			2
your wheels were still spinning fruitlessly on the ice , along with everybody else			2
stranded drivers tell their stories the unexpected voices of commuters talking and walking between cars added to the eeriness			1
there were also signs of people assisting each other			2
good samaritans helped walkers back up after a fall on the ice			1
others helped push cars whose tires squealed with effort to grip the road			1
on the other hand , there were drivers who would n't lift a finger to aid anyone if it meant giving up an inch			2
at one particularly gridlocked stretch , many people left their cars and walked to a nearby @entity110 for supplies			1
you were suddenly in the " in " crowd if you held your plastic shopping bag and its treasures like a designer handbag while trying not to bust your ass on the ice			2
i found myself looking hungrily at those bags , craving anything to eat			2
i had been at work since 6 a.m. i decided to get off at the next exit , @entity124			1
i thought that was a smart call			0
but it turned out to be a big mistake			1
there was even more ice ! here , people were spinning all over the place			0
i was convinced i would be next			0
then , the car next to me could n't move			0
so suddenly , a tiny gap opened for me to move			0
i decided to take that as a sign			0
i inched my way across the road and into the parking lot of a @entity142 , which was open overnight			0
thankfully , there were still parking spots left			0
my 2 - year - old had played with my wallet a couple of days ago , and now i ca n't find my atm card			1
anyway , i had exactly $ 5			0
so i asked what was the most food i could get for that			0
they gave me some kind of combo -- a taco , burrito , and quesadilla			0
i had to get some shut - eye			1
benefit to having a messy car : rummaging through the trunk , i found some clothes which i managed to fashion into a pillow			0
so i headed back to my car , turned on the heat full blast and , when it was warm enough , turned off the car and fell asleep			1
i woke up when it got too cold and repeated the process a few times through the night			0
fortunately , my wife had filled up the car just the day before			0
that made all the difference			0
at around 4:30 wednesday morning , the streets were still filled with stopped cars			1
and @entity142 was still filled with people			0
i walked inside to use the restroom			0
there were children inside , which broke my heart a bit			0
when i walked back outside , i saw a father cradling his infant in the driver 's seat			1
minutes later , the lights in the parking lot went out and the restaurant closed up , so everyone had to leave			0
i fantasized that when the sun came up the traffic would be moving			0
@entity193 ! as the sun rose , the first thing i could see was its reflection -- on a seemingly endless line of stationary cars in the road			1
a woman in another car near mine told me there was a @entity204 open around the corner			0
that news came as a relief			0
i spent a chunk of my morning there			0
even though the store had just a limited amount of food , the longest line was not for the cashier , but for the bathrooms			0
i saw an employee enter those bathrooms more than once with a plunger			0
my thoughts are with everyone who braved the traffic and suffered through the entire night and the morning , and with those who helped them			0
the stories i 'm hearing from my neighborhood are all about abandoned cars and inaccessible roads			1
so tonight , i will make a different choice -- i will lay my head down on a cot in my office and watch videos of my kids playing in the snow			0
@entity0 mayor : early city exodus crippled traffic			1

new : stranded @entity1 journalist retreats , goes back to work

the *country* 's ninth - largest city is essentially shut down after the storm
