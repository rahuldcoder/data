@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's fresh bid for suffered a double blow tuesday as the improved offer was dismissed by the @entity8 candy company and criticized by billionaire investor @entity9 who controls an influential stake in the @entity12 food giant			1
@entity9 said he had voted against @entity4 's plan to issue new shares as part of a cash and stock offer worth approximately $ 16 billion , warning it would hurt shareholders , @entity13 reported			1
@entity9 's @entity21 company owns 138 million @entity4 shares , making it the largest shareholder in the foodmaker with a 9.4 percent stake			1
but in a statement , he warned @entity4 's move for @entity28 risked undervaluing @entity4 stock			2
" @entity4 stock , at its current price of $ 27 , is a very expensive ' currency ' to be used in an acquisition , " @entity9 said			0
" in 2007 , in fact , @entity4 spent $ 3.6 billion to repurchase shares at about $ 33 per share , presumably because the directors and management thought the shares to be worth more			0
" earlier , @entity39 - based @entity4 said it would use the proceeds from the sale of its @entity12 pizza business to @entity43 to increase the cash element of its @entity28 offer			1
under @entity4 's offer of a partial cash alternative , @entity28 shareholders could receive cash as well as @entity4 shares if they accept @entity4 's deal			1
" @entity4 is doing this because of the desire expressed by some @entity28 security holders to have a greater proportion of the offer in cash , " @entity4 said in a statement			1
the maker of @entity60 , @entity61 , oreo cookies and @entity63 also extended the @entity28 offer to february 2			1
the original bid had expired tuesday			0
@entity28 , which rejected @entity4 's previous two deals , rejected the new offer tuesday			2
" @entity4 has once again missed the point , " a @entity28 spokesman told @entity2			0
" despite this tinkering , the @entity4 offer remains unchanged and derisory , with less than half the consideration in cash			2
" there had been rumors that @entity76 firm @entity43 , which already has a chocolate and confectionery unit , would step in and make its own offer for @entity28			2
but @entity43 put an end to those rumors tuesday by issuing a statement saying it had no intention to make an offer for the @entity8 company			1
instead , @entity43 said it had bought @entity4 's frozen pizza business in the @entity12 and @entity87 for $ 3.7 billion			1
the unit includes brands like @entity90 , @entity91 , and @entity92			0
" the acquisition brings leadership in the frozen pizza category , where @entity43 only had a minor presence until now , and builds on @entity43 's existing pizza know - how and operations in @entity100 , " @entity43 said in a statement tuesday			0
" it is a natural fit with @entity43 's focus on delivering convenient , premium , wholesome and nutritious frozen food for consumers around the world			0
" @entity43 already had a presence in @entity12 frozen food aisles with ready - meal brands like @entity109 's , @entity110 , and @entity111			0
the proceeds from the sale allow @entity4 to offer more cash to @entity28 shareholders -- an additional 60 pence ( 96 cents ) per share , @entity4 said			2
