@entity29 died in a drone attack in september 2011 in @entity30			0
the 16 - page white paper -- titled " @entity36 who is a senior operational leader of @entity7 or an @entity38 " -- is a policy paper rather than an official legal document			1

@entity52 first reported on the contents on tuesday			0
a congressional source verified the document 's legitimacy to @entity1			0
details surfaced just days before the confirmation hearing for @entity59 , who has been nominated to head the @entity27			0
@entity59 has served as president @entity17 's top counterterrorism adviser and is considered to be behind the administration 's dramatic rise in the use of targeted killings against suspected terror suspects			0
members of the @entity67 are expected to grill him on the policy at his hearing on thursday			0
the memo stated that @entity3 abroad retain their constitutional rights to due process , but the government can use lethal force against a citizen under certain circumstances			1
these include : - " where an informed , high - level official of the @entity3 government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the @entity3			1
" - " where a capture operation would be infeasible -- and where those conducting the operation continue to monitor whether capture becomes feasible			0
" - " where such an operation would be conducted consistent with applicable law of war principles			0
" but the document also said the government is not required " to have clear evidence " that an attack against the @entity3 will occur in the immediate future to determine that an imminent threat is posed by a @entity3 citizen			1
the memo cites both congressional authorization and judicial approval for the use of military force to counter the threat of terrorist attack by all individuals			1
@entity105 : @entity106 grieves teenage grandson killed by @entity3 drone the @entity109 has held that the military may constitutionally use force against an @entity3 who is a part of enemy forces			1
the document dismissed arguments by commentators that the war against @entity7 can not extend outside of @entity118			0
it asserted that " the @entity3 retains its authority to use force against @entity7 and associated forces outside the area of active hostilities when it targets a senior operational leader of the enemy force who is actively engaged in planning operations to kill @entity3			2
" the @entity128 said questions around the issue are important and have been weighed against legal concerns and discussed publicly			1
" the attorney general made clear that in taking such a strike , the government must take into account all relevant constitutional considerations			0
but that under generations - old legal principles , and @entity109 decisions , @entity3 citizenship alone does not make a leader of an enemy force immune from being targeted , " @entity128 spokesman @entity137 said on tuesday , recalling a speech last year by attorney general @entity139			1
the @entity146 called the @entity10 document " profoundly disturbing			2
" @entity148 , the director of the @entity146 's @entity149 , said , " it summarizes in cold legal terms a stunning overreach of executive authority , the claimed power to declare @entity3 a threat and kill them far from a recognized battlefield and without any judicial involvement before or after the fact			2
" @entity159 called on the @entity17 administration to release the 50 - page legal memo on which the white paper is based			1
a group of senators also called for the administration to release its legal opinions on presidential authority			0
" it is vitally important , however , for the @entity13 and the @entity3 public to have a full understanding of how the executive branch interprets the limits and boundaries of this authority so that @entity13 and the public can decide whether this authority has been properly defined and whether the president 's power to deliberately kill @entity3 citizens is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards , " according to a letter the lawmakers sent to @entity17 on monday			2
the letter is signed by sens. @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , and @entity189 , @entity190 , of the @entity67 as well as @entity191 , @entity192 ; @entity193 , @entity194 ; @entity195 , @entity186 ; @entity196 , @entity197 ; @entity198 , @entity199 ; @entity200 , @entity201 ; @entity202 , @entity203 ; and @entity204 , @entity205			0
@entity43 of @entity206 said in a statement that the @entity10 memo and other information has permitted the @entity67 to conduct " appropriate and probing " oversight into the use of lethal force			1
" that oversight is ongoing , and the committee continues to seek the actual legal opinions by the @entity10 that provide details not outlined in this particular white paper , " @entity43 said .			1

@entity10 memo sets out the conditions for using lethal force
the 16 - page document is a policy paper , not an official legal document
" clear evidence " of an imminent attack on the @entity3 is not required
