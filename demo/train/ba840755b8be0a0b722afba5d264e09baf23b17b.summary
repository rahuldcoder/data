-- when leaders get into trouble these days , they often complain that they have too little power to be effective			2
yet as debate rages about the @entity7 's handling of player discipline , the problem for @entity7 commissioner @entity6 is just the opposite : he seems to have too much power			1
while fans continue to flock to games , @entity6 and league owners must know that the @entity7 and its gold - plated brand are in increasing trouble			1
a poll by the @entity19 released this weekend shows that fan scores reflecting positive perceptions of the @entity7 have plummeted from a yearlong high of 36 to a low of -17			1
the 53 - point decline happened over the four days last week when @entity6 struggled to navigate the league through scathing headlines over its handling of evidence that @entity29 running back @entity30 attacked his then - fiancee in an elevator			1
what @entity6 and the team owners apparently fail to recognize is that the @entity7 is also a big , important business that should be run like a first - class company and is not			1
the @entity7 has a brand that is worth $ 9 billion in annual revenue ; if it were an ordinary company , it would rank about 300th on the @entity39			2
@entity6 's job is as complex as that of any ceo running a @entity39 company , but most of those companies do n't handle their human resource issues the way the @entity7 does			1
nearly every big company has to address vexing questions of how to treat employees who get into trouble by violating standards of decency or by violating the law			2
outrageous assaults on women and children are not limited to pro football ( though they occur there far too often )			0
what ceos do in those companies is to insist upfront on high standards of behavior -- but , importantly , they also set up credible , independent individuals or committees to investigate and to mete out punishment			0
their intention is to keep the administration of corporate justice as fair and as consistent as possible , trying to protect the integrity of the company 's reputation while also trying to avoid favoritism or cronyism in the way its employees are treated			0
ceos purposely stay out of the middle of individual disputes			0
but the @entity7 has structured @entity6 's job entirely differently			2
he has supreme , sweeping power over the organization , players and their behavior			2
he in effect is appointed the judge and the jury in individual cases , even as he keeps one eye over his shoulder at the owners			0
for some months now , he has been seen as too harsh , and now he is being seen as too lenient , especially in the way he has twisted and squirmed over the @entity30 case			1
@entity6 and the owners should figure out how to restructure the commissioner 's job -- or soon , he may lose it , and the league 's brand will be even more tarnished			2
the league needs to take a step back and consider that			0
not only to protect the credibility of the commissioner 's office , but more important , to maintain the value of the @entity7 brand with fans			1
a good first step on the road to better practices would be to change some @entity7 rules , starting with the one that gives the commissioner latitude to react with widely varying responses to player domestic violence arrests and convictions			1
compared with @entity30 , three players accused of domestic violence -- @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 -- received very different treatment from the commissioner 's office , ranging from a lifted four - game suspension to no suspension at all and a $ 25,000 fine			1
in all three cases , the players continued to play for @entity7 teams -- a very different outcome from what @entity30 is facing			1
fans may now have a hard time believing any @entity7 commissioner can be reliably out in front of setting constructive league standards			1
most $ 9 billion companies have an independent employee review and disciplinary system with oversight from departments separate from the ceo 's office , like @entity145			0
@entity147 , for example , outlines its system in its " @entity151 " code of conduct : assign a team of experts , conduct an investigation of all the facts , recommend corrective actions to the appropriate managers for implementation , and provide feedback to the person who raised the concern			0
the code is clear and does not call for the ceo to be involved in approving corrective actions			0
not so in the @entity7 , it seems			2
the @entity167 is general on the question of process ( " the @entity172 may initiate an investigation " ) and does not identify who investigates and recommends corrective action			0
according to press reports , it 's not clear who at the @entity7 was responsible for investigating the @entity30 affair			1
but decision - making power is clear and unilateral : " ( @entity179 ) he commissioner will have full authority to impose discipline as warranted			1
" the independent review and discipline group should also have the responsibility and expertise for talking to the press and fans			0
this would increase credibility with fans and help the league avoid the escalating , and destructive , tit - for - tat accusations we 're witnessing right now			0
it could be a model for other sports leagues including the @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
over the past two decades , prevention has become the focus of employee conduct , health and wellness			0
@entity6 controls , but has not deployed , the league resources that could help prevent criminal player behavior in the first place			2
while @entity7 player arrests peaked in the mid- 2000s , most organizations would not sit back and accept that one in 40 of their employees is arrested each year -- mostly for @entity215 incidents			1
corporate prevention programs also mitigate on - the - job injuries			0
one can only guess if as many players would have suffered , or if the @entity7 would have faced a $ 950 million payout to players earlier this year , if player training to avoid concussions had been sponsored by the league			1
enshrined in the @entity7 @entity228 is a call to higher standards : " while criminal activity is clearly outside the scope of permissible conduct , and persons who engage in criminal activity will be subject to discipline , the standard of conduct for persons employed in the @entity7 is considerably higher			1
it is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime			0
instead , as an employee of the @entity7 or a member club , you are held to a higher standard and expected to conduct yourself in a way that is responsible , promotes the values upon which the @entity172 is based , and is lawful			1
" great organizations do create standards , partly by standing behind their brand and company values in all kinds of public ways			0
if he believes in holding the @entity7 to a higher standard , perhaps @entity6 should be looking at starting the @entity252 to prevent @entity253			2
it would not only be a smart move to leverage a fan base that includes 55 % men and 45 % women , but a tangible example of the higher level of conduct the league aspires to			0
the @entity7 owns a treasured brand , beloved by many @entity264 , that is the gold standard for world - class sports entertainment			2
for @entity6 , the time has clearly come to use big - league management practices to run the show .			0

@entity30 case and others raise questions about @entity7 player discipline
@entity277 : the @entity7 puts too much power in the hands of its commissioner
she says league would be better served by having other staff make these calls
@entity277 : @entity7 should look to the way major corporations handle employee *wrongdoing*
