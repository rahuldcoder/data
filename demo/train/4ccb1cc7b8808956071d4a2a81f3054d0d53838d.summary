the walkout included employees in the petroleum , railway and telecommunication industries , as protests demanding the resignation of president @entity16 dragged into their 17th day			1
on wednesday , tens of thousands of protesters jammed @entity1 's @entity18 , with so many spilling into a nearby compound of government buildings that government officials moved parliament to another site			1

@entity0 foreign minister @entity29 told @entity32 ' " @entity31 " wednesday that the military might have to intervene if that were to occur			1
" do we want the armed forces to assume the responsibility of stabilizing the nation through imposing martial law , and the army in the streets ? " @entity29 asked rhetorically			0
" for the army to rule , to step in , to put its friends on the scene , that would be a very dangerous possibility			0
" he urged the protesters to adopt " some rationality " and said the self - proclaimed @entity46 , a group of prominent @entity0 from various walks of life , should determine a course of action			1
@entity29 told @entity32 that @entity16 's interest was to protect the stability of the most populous nation in the @entity55 world			1
that 's why he will not accede to the protesters ' demands that he relinquish power immediately , he said			2

@entity71 has put the death toll at more than 300 since the january 25 rally that ignited the movement			0
" instead of running scared , the regime is fighting back with both words and violence to quash its opponents , portraying the opposition as a foreign - backed , @entity82 group of conspirators , " @entity71 said wednesday on its website			1
" sadly , its propaganda campaign appears to be as crude as its actual physical crackdown has been			0
" the protests were largely peaceful wednesday , with demonstrators in one rally composed solely of children who chanted anti-mubarak slogans			1
" we want the whole regime to end because they are not making our lives any easier , " said 11 - year - old @entity91			0
some of their older relatives said they had brought the children to the square to witness history unfolding			0
" it is the birth of freedom , " said @entity91 's uncle , @entity100			2
" witnessing this event will engrave in them love of this nation , loyalty , freedom and respecting change			0
i want them to be free			0
" but the prospect of freedom was competing with the cost of living as a motivator for some @entity0 , 20 % of whom live in poverty			1
" @entity123 stays or @entity123 goes , what 's important is that the youth get jobs , " said @entity119 , a mother of three living an hour outside @entity1 , in the rural town of @entity121 on the @entity122			2
her work at a doctor 's office earns her $ 30 per month -- not enough to pay the electricity bill			2
@entity119 said her husband , a day laborer , has been unable to find work since the demonstrations began on january 25			2
" our situation is horrible , to be honest , " she said as she showed @entity2 the bedroom where she , her husband and their three daughters sleep			0
" i can hardly feed them			0
" on the streets of @entity1 , the people showed no signs of relenting			0
they chanted , " @entity16 is a thief			1
" the embattled president , meanwhile , went about business as usual wednesday , meeting with his foreign minister and @entity146 's deputy foreign minister , state - run television showed			1
the unrest extended beyond @entity1			0
two people were killed and others were wounded in clashes with police in southern @entity0 , state tv reported			1
a journalist said the hostilities stemmed from complaints about a member of the police force in @entity159			0
in the northern town of @entity163 , protesters attacked the governor 's building over a land and housing dispute , state tv said			2
the protesters were galvanized by the tears and words of an activist who was seized by security forces and held for 10 days before he was released monday			0
" if you are true @entity0 , if you are heroic @entity0 , it 's time to step down , " @entity173 told @entity2 wednesday in a message directed to the ruling elite			1
the 30 - year - old @entity0 father of two administered the @entity180 page that is widely credited with calling the first protest			1
@entity173 , on leave from his job at @entity184 in @entity185 , said he was prepared to die for the cause			0
" kidnap me , kidnap all my colleagues ! " @entity173 said in comments that challenged vice president @entity189 to try to undo his efforts and those of his supporters			2
" put us in jail ! kill us ! do whatever you want to do			0
we are getting back our country			0
you guys have been ruining this country for 30 years			0
enough ! enough ! enough ! " @entity16 's regime said tuesday that it had discussed a number of reforms with leaders of various opposition groups and appointed a panel to look into amending the constitution			1
but its insistence that @entity16 's immediate exit was a recipe for chaos elicited impatience from the @entity212 administration			1
@entity213 is calling on its @entity215 ally to expand negotiations with opposition groups , lift the 30 - year state of emergency and make constitutional changes to bring about democratic elections			0
but @entity222 press secretary @entity221 expressed impatience wednesday with the pace of progress on those matters			0
" i think it is clear that what the government has thus far put forward has yet to meet a minimum threshold for the people of @entity0 , " he told reporters			1
a short @entity222 statement on @entity236 vice president @entity235 's telephone conversation with vice president @entity189 used the word " immediate " or " immediately " four times			1
@entity235 " urged that the transition produce immediate , irreversible progress that responds to the aspirations of the @entity0 people			2
" the statement also hinted the @entity222 harbors doubts as to whether the @entity0 government is seriously committed to reforms , referring to the regime 's statements as " what the government is saying it is prepared to accept			1
" meanwhile , an @entity55 diplomat said that @entity251 would consider matching the more than $ 1.5 billion in military aid that the @entity236 provides each year to @entity0 if @entity213 were to cut it			2
@entity2 's @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0
