-- the army - navy game this saturday marks the 120th anniversary of the great football rivalry			1
their first game , played on a gridiron laid out on southeast corner of the @entity8 , was so sparsely attended that spectators could move up and down the field as the line of scrimmage shifted			0
we have come a long way from that first encounter , but as @entity18 and @entity19 get ready to play again , the legacy of that 1890 game is worth recalling			1
in 1890 @entity18 had only one player with any real football experience -- @entity22 , in whose honor today 's @entity8 's football stadium is named			0
as a result @entity18 was trounced 24 - 0 by a @entity19 team that had been playing football since 1886			1
the next year @entity18 hired a part - time coach , played a series of early - season games , and with @entity22 ( who would die tragically in the @entity32 ) once again leading the way , @entity18 avenged its earlier loss by a 32 - 16 score			0
both teams could now claim bragging rights			0
their competition had gotten off to the perfect start			0
five years before the advent of the modern @entity42 , the two service academies had turned their new athletic rivalry into front - page news			1
the army - navy game , as those reporting it noted , quickly became as much about character as physical skill			1
" @entity51 was the most conspicuous feature of the game of football at @entity8 on saturday between the cadets of the @entity57 and @entity56 , " an 1890 account observed			1
" where bravery was so common and so notable it would be unfair and unjust to cite one man as braver than another			0
" the public 's response to that first encounter worked to the advantage of both schools , and they went out of their way to make sure their rivalry remained consistent with the military values they sought to display on the gridiron			1
when in the wake of the 1893 game , which drew a crowd of 8,000 , animosities between the two academies reached such a fever pitch that a retired rear admiral and a brigadier general came close to fighting a duel , the game was canceled for six years by order of the secretary of war and secretary of the navy			1
the lessons the cancellation taught were absorbed by both sides , and when the game resumed in 1899 on a neutral site , @entity93 in @entity94 , before 27,000 people , everything went so smoothly that @entity18 and @entity19 officials decided that the game must be played annually			1
making sure their football rivalry did not deteriorate into petty squabbles paid further dividends two years later when president @entity103 and 30,000 fans attended the 1901 army - navy game			1
the president became so excited about the play , which featured a 105 - yard kickoff return by @entity18 's star quarterback , that at one point he left his seat and moved to the sidelines to get closer to the action			0
but @entity103 was careful , despite having served as assistant secretary of the navy , to maintain public neutrality			0
at halftime he inaugurated the presidential tradition of moving from one team 's side of the stadium to the other 's			0
since @entity103 's time , the army - navy football game has always had a life of its own			1
in his memoir , " @entity124 , " legendary @entity18 coach @entity126 wrote , " the primary objective of @entity18 football must be victory over @entity19			2
it can not be achieved by anything less than complete dedication			0
" for @entity19 's coaches victory over @entity18 has the same priority			2
coaches at both schools know that success in the army - navy game is crucial to keeping their jobs			1
how far this pressure to win goes is epitomized by the story former @entity18 coach @entity142 tells in his autobiography , " @entity152 , " of a dinner party at the home of gen. @entity146 , later commander of @entity148 troops in @entity149 , who while superintendent of @entity8 hired @entity142 in 1962 to revive @entity18 's football fortunes			2
" there 's one thing you 'll need to understand right from the beginning , " the general 's wife , @entity153 , told @entity142			0
then , turning around , she flipped up her skirt to reveal a pair of blank panties with " @entity162 ! " printed on them in bright gold letters			0
in 1944 , when @entity18 , led by its @entity167 running backs " @entity168 and @entity169 , was ranked @entity170 in the nation and @entity19 , with a line superior to @entity18 's , was ranked @entity173 , they played an epic game , won by @entity18 , that helped sell more than $ 58 million in war bonds			2
at the game 's conclusion , sports ' columnist @entity176 wrote , " the country can now return to the normalcy of fighting the most terrible war ever inflicted upon mankind			0
the army - navy game has passed into history			1
" but an even more revealing comment on the place the @entity19 had come to occupy in @entity188 was summed up by a telegram that general @entity190 , then leading @entity148 forces in the @entity192 , sent to @entity18 's coach in 1944			1
" the greatest of all army teams , " @entity190 wired			0
" we have stopped the war to celebrate your magnificent success			0
" @entity190 's hyperbole was deliberate , but there was nothing exaggerated about his belief that the army - navy game should serve as an antidote to dark times			1
when the army - navy game of 1963 was canceled as a result of the assassination of president @entity211 , it was played a week later at the request of the @entity211 family , and the coin that president @entity211 would have flipped to decide which team received the opening kickoff was sent as a gift by secretary of the army @entity218 to @entity19 's winning football captain @entity220			1
the following year , with the @entity221 in its early stages , retired president @entity224 , then living in @entity225 , @entity226 , put his own stamp on the army - navy game			1
@entity224 , a 1915 @entity8 graduate , had desperately wanted to be a football star , and in 1912 he was heralded as one of the best running backs in the @entity232			0
a knee injury ended his football career and kept him out of the 1912 army - navy game , but over the years , @entity224 maintained his interest in @entity18 football			1
when he was asked by a cadet interviewing him for @entity8 's student - run @entity239 to send the 1964 @entity18 team a telegram on the eve of the game , he happily complied			2
the telegram was designed to rally @entity18 's players , who had lost five straight games to @entity19 , then led by @entity167 quarterback and future @entity250 star @entity249			2
but what emerged from @entity224 's telegram was much more than a call for victory			0
for @entity224 , the essence of the army - navy game was the pressure it put on everyone who participated in it to hold nothing back			1
" you will always have what you give today			0
the more you give the more you will keep ! " @entity224 wrote in a message that is as relevant today as it was in 1964			0
@entity19 football remains a stellar attraction but it has suffered from the increased competition for fans ' attention at the pro and college ranks			2
that does n't , however , take away from what the game stands for			2
this year 's game , like those of the past , marks the last time most of both teams ' seniors will ever step on a football field			2
as they have known ever since they arrived at @entity8 and @entity282 , what awaits them is not a tryout in the @entity286 or a lucrative job in business , but active service , which these days amounts to a five - year commitment			1
in no other athletic rivalry is the price of participation higher			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity296 .			2

the army - navy game on saturday marks the 120th anniversary of the football rivalry
@entity296 : both academies made sure the rivalry was consistent with military values
the game has become tradition for @entity148 and an antidote to dark times , @entity306 writes
@entity306 : @entity19 players do n't go directly to @entity286 or a lucrative job , but to active service
