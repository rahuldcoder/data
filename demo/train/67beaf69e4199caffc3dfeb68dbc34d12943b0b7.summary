-- when @entity7 , makers of a virtual - reality headset many view as the future of video gaming , agreed in march to a $ 2 billion buyout by @entity9 , they were n't tempted by the success of " @entity11 " or " @entity12			1
" instead , they eyed the 1.2 billion people who use @entity9 every month , with dreams of dropping most of them together into a new , virtual world			1
" with @entity7 ... if you 're putting on this pair of glasses and you 're going to be face - to - face communicating with people and you 're going to be jumping in and out of this new set of virtual worlds , this was going to be the largest mmo ( massively multiuser online community ) ever made , " @entity7 ceo @entity18 said monday at the @entity20 conference in @entity21			1
" this is going to be an mmo where we want to put a billion people in virtual reality , and a billion - person virtual - world @entity29 is going to require a bigger network than exists today			1
why not start with @entity9 and their infrastructure and their team and talent that they 've built up ? " designed by a team with strong roots in the video - gaming world , the @entity42 is a headset that provides a 360 - degree field of vision , allowing wearers to view , and react to , their surroundings in a realistic manner			1
created by 20 - year - old @entity42 , @entity7 first turned heads in 2012 when it went to @entity52 in hopes of making enough money to continue development and ended up raking in nearly $ 2.5 million			2
gaming legend @entity56 , the lead programmer of pioneering games such as " @entity58 " and " @entity59 , " has since come on board , and the headset has been hailed by many , including @entity0 and @entity62 , as one of the top inventions in recent years			0
but when @entity7 sold to @entity9 , many in the gaming community were surprised			1
if they were going to sell , why not to @entity67 , @entity68 or @entity69 , the gaming world 's major players ? @entity18 said it was all about escaping limitations			1
" we 're very committed to gaming			0
but do we want to be @entity78 or do we want to be @entity79 or @entity80 ? " he said , referring to @entity69 's now - defunct handheld gaming device			2
" i think @entity78 was an awesome platform , but i think you 'll see handheld game devices largely disrupted by the mobile market and mobile devices			0
" since developer kits began shipping in spring 2013 , @entity7 has continued to add to the roster of companies hoping to create content for its system			0
the process heated up even more in the wake of the @entity9 deal , @entity18 said , when some of the gaming world 's top names jumped in , seemingly reassured that investing time in development would pay off in the long run			1
but he says it would be a mistake to limit @entity7 to gaming			2
" we started off with a big focus on gaming , which we still have -- we 're all former game developers , " he said			0
" then , looking at where vision and @entity107 is going to go in the next 10 years , it 's going to be a lot about face - to - face communication and social			1
" a number of people ... have said this is going to be the most social platform of all time			0
" thus far , @entity9 seems satisfied to bring @entity7 into the family and then largely allow it to continue doing its own thing			2
that 's the model @entity9 has employed with @entity118 and @entity119 , other successful startups it snapped up in recent years			0
@entity9 's $ 19 billion move you might not notice @entity18 said many within @entity7 were leery of being taken over by anyone , and that @entity9 ceo @entity125 specifically mentioned @entity118 and @entity119 as examples of how the relationship would work			1
" you can use any part of @entity9 , or not ; it 's up to you guys , " @entity18 said he was told			2
" you now just have one of the biggest networks in the world behind you			0
" he also teased a mind - blowing new generation of virtual reality coming in the future from @entity7 that will challenge our perception of what 's real and what 's not			1
" this avatar you 're looking at , your brain will be convinced it 's a person , because it is , " he said			0
" it 's just the virtual representation of a person ... ( but ) you 'll be there going , ' i know that 's you			0
it does n't quite look like you -- you 're a cartoon or you 've changed your hair -- but i can tell it 's you			0
' and your brain will be convinced			0

@entity7 ceo : we want a virtual - reality world with 1 billion people in it
@entity18 says @entity9 deal was *attractive* because of network 's size
he says gaming is still *important* , but @entity107 will *transform* social
@entity18 was *speaking* at @entity20 in @entity21
