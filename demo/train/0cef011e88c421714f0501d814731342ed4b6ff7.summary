@entity0 -- a deeply divided @entity2 ruled wednesday that criminal defendants who receive inadequate legal advice on pretrial plea bargains can have their sentences overturned , equating that with an unconstitutional and ineffective assistance of counsel			1
the separate 5 - 4 decisions in a pair of cases from @entity11 and @entity12 will have a huge , immediate impact on the 97 % of federal convictions and 94 % of state convictions that stem from guilty pleas			1
" this court now holds that , as a general rule , defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accused , " said justice @entity17 , joining four of his more liberal colleagues			1
" when the defense counsel allowed the offer to expire without advising the defendant or allowing him to consider it , defense counsel did not render the effective assistance the @entity34 requires			1
" in a rare oral dissent delivered from the bench , justice @entity35 called the majority decision " absurd " and " unheard - of			1
" in unusual detail , the opinion lays out specific guidelines to defense counsel , saying they must relay plea bargain offers from the prosecution , regardless whether the lawyer believes them to be proper			1
the case from @entity11 involved @entity49 , convicted of assault with intent to murder and other charges , after shooting and seriously wounding a woman			0
the state twice offered to dismiss two of the charges , and recommended a reduced sentence in return for a guilty plea			1
@entity49 claims he rejected the offers after his lawyer convinced him the prosecution could not prove the most serious charge			0
the defendant was convicted and received 185 to 360 months behind bars			0
in @entity12 , @entity67 was charged with driving on a revoked license			0
three previous convictions on the same charge meant he could be sentenced to up to four years in prison			0
court records shows he was not told about two pretrial plea bargain offers that would have reduced his jail time			1
a week before his preliminary court hearing , the man was again arrested on the same offense			2
with no deal on the table , he subsequently pleaded guilty and received three years imprisonment			0
" there appears to be a reasonable probability @entity83 would have accepted the prosecutor 's original offer of a plea bargain if the offer had been communicated to him , " @entity17 said in his ruling , " because he pleaded guilty ( later ) to a more serious charge , with no promise of a sentencing recommendation from the prosecution			2
" justices @entity93 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 supported @entity17 , who again proved to be the " swing " vote for the majority			0
both cases were sent back to lower courts to sort out the new sentencing guidelines			0
in his dissent , @entity35 warned criminal defendants will now flood courts with new claims of bad legal representation			1
" the court today embraces the sporting chance theory of criminal law , in which the state functions like a conscientious casino operator , giving each player a fair chance to beat the house , that is , serve less time than the law says he deserves , " he said			2
" and when a player is excluded from the tables , his constitutional rights have been violated			0
" he added , " in today 's cases , the court 's zeal to bring perfection to everything requires the reversal of perfectly valid , eminently just convictions , " @entity35 said			1
" it is not wise ; it is not right			0
" chief justice @entity131 and justices @entity132 and @entity134 joined all or part of the dissent			2
the cases are @entity49 v. @entity138 ( 10 - 209 ) and @entity12 v. @entity83 ( 10 - 444 ) .			2

defense attorneys have a duty to give good advice on plea deals , the court rules
they must do so to provide " the effective assistance the @entity34 requires "
in dissent , @entity35 calls the decision " absurd " and " unheard - of "
