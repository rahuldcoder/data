-- the picture of @entity3 ceo @entity2 tilted on a lounge chair , hair flowing above her and shot from above has sparked a mini-firestorm among women			1
a significant number of women , feeling not too distanced from the days when women @entity10 were just a fond hope , much less an aspiration , were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a @entity19 fashion shoot			1
the fact that it was kind of sexy added just a little gasoline to the fire			0
but to be fair , the reaction was far from uniform ; other women slammed back and said , " why not ? " " she 's earned the right to do anything she wants , and why not be sexy and a ceo ? we do n't have to wear the same uniform men do , we can do it our way "			1
well , i am teetering towards the middle but coming down on the side of the disappointed			0
on the one hand , @entity2 ca n't avoid the fact that she 's a role model , even if she did n't start out to be one			1
her picture seems to say to us , " here 's a real me that 's just as important as being a ceo			0
look at how pretty and sexy i am ! " now any woman can understand that			0
sexed up and smart : women debate @entity2 's @entity19 photo posing for the camera is always a narcissistic act , and i dare say , most women 's first reaction to seeing themselves in a photo that surfaces in a newspaper , or in a private family shot , is " how do i look ? " i plead guilty			1
but still , here 's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains , does she still need to self - validate by having a beautiful fashion gig ? what does that say to all the women who would never be beautiful enough to do that , but might be brainy enough to have her job ? should they feel " less than @entity2 " because they ca n't qualify for the @entity19 slot ? could n't @entity2 just take pictures that show her as a stylish and good - looking ceo rather than as a babe who is showing her great legs in $ 1,000 shoes ? but then there is the other side			1
we all do love to look great and be admired			0
and why should she be denied her one month of being a famous fashonista ? she 's worked hard to gain the prominence she earned , and some girls , even very smart girls , do , just like the song says , " just want to have fun " ... at least occasionally			0
@entity82 turns heads with photo shoot i get it , and i get why she did it			1
but she has to take note of how pained a lot of women are about this fashion photo			2
not just a few women felt hurt looking at the @entity82 layout , wondering silently or out loud if acquiescing to this kind of shot means that for @entity82 , and perhaps for other women , that " making it " and " having it all " needs to include being publicly admired for one 's allure			2
that 's a depressing thought for many talented women who are not beautiful or not sexy			2
they do not have that card to play and this layout could certainly make them wonder if selection for the top job requires being lovely			0
we women would like to feel that for at least some of us , sheer competence would make looks a non-issue in our lives			0
we would like to think that a brainiac like @entity2 would n't need , perhaps would not want , to have a very public glamor shot as a career capstone			2
unfortunately , it is not an exaggeration to say that @entity2 is kind of saying , even though i am sure she did not mean to , that to have it all , sure , you have to be smart , but , let 's face it , you also need to be beautiful			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity129 .			0

@entity3 ceo @entity2 posed for stylish @entity19 fashion shoot
@entity129 : some women wished @entity82 did n't need affirmation of such a *spread*
she asks if @entity82 could n't have gotten *credit* for her brains rather than her looks
@entity129 : the *unintended* *message* is you have to be smart and beautiful
