@entity0 , @entity1 -- a woman wailed as security guards dragged her out of the briefing room used to provide updates on missing @entity7			1
she is the mother of one of the passengers , and her protest is but one sign that patience is fraying among the relatives of the missing			1
the families of the passengers have been mostly out of the spotlight as @entity1 authorities spearhead a mission to find the plane			1
but as day 12 rolled around with no answers , the frustration became evident			2
not knowing the fate of their loved ones weighs heavily on the family members , who are desperate for answers			1
three women , relatives of the passengers , staged a protest at the @entity0 hotel where the world 's media is staying			1
their efforts were cut short by security guards who removed them through a crush of reporters , dragging one as she screamed			1
anger as relatives confront officials " i do n't care what your government does , " one woman shouted , referring to the @entity1			1
" i just want my son back			2
" the flashes from dozens of cameras lit up her face as she spoke			0
the woman identified herself as the mother of @entity53 , a 36 - year - old @entity54 national aboard the missing plane			1
" my son , " she said , weeping			0
" i just want my son back			0
" another woman , wearing a blue shirt , white baseball cap , sunglasses and a face mask , raised her right arm as she demanded more information from the @entity1 government			1
" we need media from the entire world ( to ) help us find our lost families and find the @entity7 plane , " the woman said			1
" we have no information at all			0
... they only say ' keep searching ' -- from @entity72 to @entity73 to @entity74			0
" why no phone calls from the plane ? she and the other families waiting in @entity0 said they are n't satisfied with " the @entity1 government 's inaction			1
" " what we need is to know the truth , to know where the plane is , " she shouted			0
" we have had enough			0
" guards then escorted the women out , apparently against their will			1
the screams of @entity53 's mother were piercing as she was dragged through a sea of reporters			1
the other two women were led out by guards			1
all three were taken to a room in the hotel , and @entity1 authorities blocked the door			1
afterward , @entity1 's acting defense and transport minister @entity100 expressed " regret " about the incident , which he promised to look into			2
" one can only imagine the anguish they are going through , " @entity100 said in a statement			0
" @entity1 is doing everything in its power to find @entity7 and hopefully bring some degree of closure for those whose family members are missing			1
" how do passenger jets change flight paths ? relatives wait in @entity116 the agony of the wait was felt not just in @entity0			1
families in @entity116 -- the scheduled destination for @entity7 -- also gather daily for a briefing with officials			1
@entity123 , whose brother - in - law is on the missing plane , says every day is the same			1
he and his group leave the hotel in the morning for a daily briefing , and that 's it			1
they go back to the hotel to watch the news on television			2
the deepening mystery has taken its toll on the families			0
@entity123 's sister -- the wife of one of the passengers -- has become very unstable , he said			1
" every morning , she feels that she 's got hope when she comes to the briefing			2
then they simply say those blurry things again , " @entity123 said			0
" then she loses hope again			0
" he continued : " it 's like this every single day			2
she always hopes that a miracle will happen , but it does n't			0
i do n't know when this miracle will happen			0
how many days have we got left , i do n't know			0
" @entity123 's brother - in - law is a veteran of the @entity153 ' @entity0 - @entity116 route , a silver - level frequent flier			1
the airline 's handling of the situation is so unpopular that the families in @entity116 are talking about potential lawsuits			1
@entity123 asked for an envoy from the airline to confer with the families to explain the details of the situation			0
" the longer the wait , the bigger the mental shadow we have , " he said			0
that 's not to say relatives are giving up			1
for proof , all one needs to do is look at a board inside a conference room of @entity116 's @entity174 -- inscribed with heart - wrenching messages such as , " @entity177 , why do n't you call home ? " and " we 're waiting for you to come home for dinner			1
" one reads : " @entity183 , please come back safe			0
i just want to see your face , hold your hands and hear your teachings			0
" experts answer your questions @entity192 flight unity in a show of solidarity , some families of the victims of @entity195 , which also went missing before its wreckage was found , wrote an open letter to the families of flight 370 passengers			2
the letter expressed dismay about the vague and sometimes contradictory statements from the @entity1 government , and it suggested that families turn to their home governments to pressure the @entity1 for details			0
the letter was written by a group of relatives of @entity195 victims who lived in @entity211			2
the president of the group , dr. @entity214 , said it is necessary for the families of flight 370 to stick together and to pressure officials " to make sure they are getting answers			0
" @entity214 lost a daughter in the @entity192 tragedy , and he said coping with the incident becomes easier over time			0
" yes , in the first moment you are completely paralyzed , but life goes on , it 's necessary , " he said			2
for now , the @entity7 families are in limbo -- frustrated by the lack of clear information , while fending off their worst fears and clinging to hope			1
it 's all consuming , said @entity234 , whose brother and " best friend " @entity236 , originally from @entity237 , was on flight 370			1
" you spend 24 hours a day thinking about it , really -- every waking moment and even in the few moments of sleep , " @entity234 told @entity2 's @entity239 on wednesday			2
" the first thing i do is go straight on the internet in the morning and see if there 's any update			2
and every day ... there 's no solid information about anything			2
" @entity252 , the partner of @entity254 @entity253 , initially thought the plane had been commandeered or hijacked			0
as time elapsed , that theory has gained followers			0
" all my friends were starting to think that perhaps i was just in denial , and i was even starting to doubt myself a little bit , " @entity252 told @entity2 '			0
" so when all of this new evidence started to come out , it gave me confidence that i was n't so crazy after all			0
" she is no aviation expert , but she has intuition , and it tells her that the passengers , including @entity253 , are still alive			2
whoever is holding the passengers hostage in this scenario can achieve their goal without hurting anyone , she said			2
there is no evidence that this is the case , but it is her message to any possible captors			0
" miracles do happen , " she said			0
" they happen every day			0
