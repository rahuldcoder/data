-- will @entity1 elect a punchline as mayor ? @entity5 's entry into the @entity1 race for mayor was one of the issues we discussed with comedian @entity9 , our guest this week on the @entity0 weekly podcast " the @entity11 , " co-hosted by @entity0 's @entity12 , @entity13 and myself			1
@entity9 , who many know from his @entity17 specials and his numerous appearances on " the @entity19 " and " @entity20 , " also talked with us about his new book " @entity25 " ( no. 5 on the @entity24 ' @entity23 ) , in which he writes about the adventures of raising five young children with his wife in a midsized @entity1 apartment			1
@entity9 offered some very funny yet helpful advice to my co-hosts , who are married to each other and expecting their first child this summer			1
@entity9 offered particularly instructive guidance for how @entity12 and @entity13 can cope with their expected son 's most traumatizing day : his circumcision			1
but back to @entity5 : for those of you who missed it , in 2011 the former congressman texted pictures of his private parts to women , lied about it , had to resign			0
we all agreed his mayoral bid ca n't simply be dismissed as a joke			0
in fact , a new poll has him in second place in the mayoral race , and he has close to $ 4 million in his campaign chest			0
@entity5 might just win this race -- assuming he has figured out the proper way to use @entity60			0
in the podcast , we also tackled two other issues that sparked heated discussions and had unexpected results			2
the first was political hypocrisy in the response to the @entity68 tornado			1
certainly all elected officials expressed their condolences and support for the people who suffered as a result of this devastating natural disaster			0
but we saw some @entity76 members of @entity77 from @entity68 -- most notably sen. @entity78 -- now supporting federal disaster relief for the people of their state			1
but these same people opposed supporting federal aid for the victims of @entity85 , which hit in october			2
this was n't lost on a fellow @entity76 , rep. @entity88			0
he called them out -- and caused me , probably for the first time in my life , to agree with something @entity88 said			0
our biggest debate on this issue , though , was over the role the federal government should play in helping people after a natural disaster			0
@entity12 said federal government should n't be the primary source of funding for these people , arguing that instead the government can be a facilitator , seeking and encouraging private funds and donations to provide assistance			0
in contrast , i strongly believe that the federal government should be leading and funding the relief effort so that people in need are helped as quickly as possible			0
our third big issue was @entity1 mayor @entity116 's comment this week that if you were n't at the top of your class in high school , you should n't waste the money and time on college and instead you should become " a plumber			1
" as @entity13 noted , this sentiment echoed a 2012 statement by former @entity76 presidential candidate @entity125 , who mocked president @entity126 as being a " snob " for saying he wanted everyone to go to college			1
instead , @entity125 believed that some should forget college and instead pursue jobs that require using your hands			2
while we all agreed that the costs of a college education now border on the obscene , we did not agree on what was causing the hike in tuition prices			2
but there was no dispute that anyone who dreams of going to college and has graduated high school should have the opportunity to pursue higher education			2
a college education not only increases a person 's knowledge , it results in more employment opportunities and better wages			1
in fact , people with less than a high school diploma have an unemployment rate of 12.4 %			0
in contrast , the unemployment rate of those with a four - year college degree is only 4.5 % , well below the national unemployment rate of 7.5 %			1
we hope you check out this week 's episode of " the @entity11			2
" we would love to hear your thoughts on the podcast and the issues we raised			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			1
