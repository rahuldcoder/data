-- a growing religion in southern @entity2 is posing a threat to the survival of wild leopards			1
for the @entity7 , also known as the @entity8 , leopards are seen as a symbol of pride , beauty and wealth , while their skins are viewed as essential attire for church elders who wear them around their necks during traditional ceremonies			1
a mixture of @entity21 and @entity22 culture , the @entity8 is one of the biggest traditional religious groups in @entity2 with around 5 million members			1
there are fears from conservationists that as the church grows , @entity2 's leopards , already listed as " near threatened " by the @entity30 ( @entity30 ) , will be pushed towards extinction			2
" from visiting a few of these ( church ) gatherings , you realize that it 's not 92 or 100 or 200 ( leopard skins )			1
we are talking about thousands of leopard skins , " said @entity39 , a conservationist at the @entity40 in @entity41			1
@entity39 first found out about the @entity8 in the course of helping with a police investigation , after a pile of at least 92 leopard skins was uncovered during a village raid			1
many of those skins had been tailored into clothing meant for the church group			2
besides being killed by farmers trying to protect their livestock , 150 leopards are legally targeted by trophy hunters each year			0
but increasingly poachers kill them to profit from their use in traditional medicine and ceremonial dress			1
" what we are finding is that they are actually being targeted , instead of it being by - catch from the illegal bush meat trade , " @entity39 said			0
" they are actually putting poisons out to target leopards because there is such a high demand for leopard skins now			1
" the feline species is protected by the @entity73 , or @entity73 , and the sale or possession of its parts is illegal in @entity2			2
those who wear it as traditional gear , including @entity22 royalty and high - profile individuals like president @entity83 , are required to have permits issued by the state			0
but at @entity8 church gatherings , trade in skins is done openly with no law enforcement			1
@entity39 's attempt to solve this conflict of tradition and conservation has taken him to @entity94 where he has been trying to find a suitable fake fur alternative for church members			1
" i went to @entity97 and spent a week there , meeting with factory representatives to try and develop this fur into the level that was needed and the quality that was needed , " @entity39 said			0
and the quality is crucial , because while the church 's leadership has warmed to the concept of fake leopard skins , they still have to approve of the product			1
@entity39 says the church 's followers will only be converted to fake items if the leaders say it is acceptable			2
on a recent trip to @entity115 , @entity2 , where the church was founded , @entity39 visited a church gathering and showed his fur samples to a senior preacher			2
" it 's beautiful , but it 's not the real thing , " said the preacher , @entity120			0
" it 's like a blanket			0
after some time , it will wear out			0
real leopard skin can last for more than 20 years			0
" @entity120 said he had no idea trade in leopard parts was illegal , and he did not know that the leopard was a threatened species			0
he said that as an elder he could not wear a fake costume , but he could see a place for fake fur in the church as membership continued to swell and the prices of leopard skin seemed to be rising			1
" it will help the congregation and protect the leopard from extinction , " he said			0
@entity39 is also hoping that church followers who can not afford the real thing would find the cheaper version an enticing alternative , but so far they have not shown enthusiasm			0
at the gathering in @entity115 real skins were being sold for $ 440 each			0
" we are improving the product as we speak , " @entity39 said			0
" if we can get one of the leaders to wear one of these things and say to the people , ' this is accepted from now on , we do not wear real leopard skins anymore , we have an alternative , ' that statement ... would be the pinnacle of this whole project			2
