ethics troubles complicated @entity4 gov. @entity3 's chances of becoming @entity6 's running mate last year , the @entity0 reports is in an upcoming chronicle of the 2012 presidential campaign			1
the @entity0 reported that too many questions remained after @entity3 completed the vetting process and @entity6 had lingering concerns			1
the details come four days before @entity4 voters head to the polls to determine if @entity3 gets a second term			1
during a campaign stop friday , he dismissed the report and told @entity19 that the authors are " just trying to sell books			2
" @entity3 's challenges were first reported thursday night by @entity0 national political correspondent @entity23 and based on details of the book , " @entity26 : @entity27 2012			1
" the highly anticipated book about the presidential election by @entity30 and @entity31 , is expected to be a juicy tell - all about the inner - workings of the presidential campaign			1
those concerns included a @entity36 investigation of @entity3 's expenditures while he was a @entity39 attorney in @entity4			1
a 2010 report by the department 's inspector general concluded @entity3 â € ” among five top prosecutors investigated -- was the " the @entity39 attorney who most often exceeded the government ( travel expense ) rate without adequate justification			1
" he also offered " insufficient , inaccurate or no justification " for most of those costs , and refused to meet personally with investigators about the discrepancies			0
@entity3 was not identified by name in the government report , but government sources have said he was " @entity39 attorney c , " @entity19 confirmed			1
@entity6 adviser @entity57 , who ran @entity6 's vice presidential search committee , told @entity19 that " governor @entity3 complied fully with the @entity6 campaign 's request for documents in a timely manner , including a complete medical report from his internist and cardiologist			1
" @entity6 ultimately chose rep. @entity67 of @entity68 as his running mate			0
@entity70 vs. @entity71 president @entity73 's closest advisers may have secretly considered replacing vice president @entity70 with @entity74 on the 2012 ticket , but @entity77 spokesman @entity76 said friday that it was never a remote possibility			1
" campaigns and pollsters test a lot of things , " he told reporters at the daily @entity77 briefing			2
" what i can tell you without a doubt is that the president never considered that and if anyone brought that to him , he would have laughed it out of the room , would never take it seriously			0
" @entity76 earlier told @entity19 's " @entity98 " that he knew " for a fact " @entity73 never considered it , later saying the idea was never brought to him			1
he answered affirmatively when asked if @entity73 thought @entity70 would be a strong chief executive , saying that he had been an asset to the president in two campaigns and throughout the administration			1
i think the president picked @entity70 as his running mate for the right reason , which is , if necessary , the vice president could be president			2
that 's the first item on your checklist when you 're picking your running mate , " @entity76 said at the @entity77			0
asked about sizing up the potential @entity112 presidential field , @entity76 replied , " i think they all ought to run			0
" @entity115 , who was then @entity73 's chief of staff , said the swap was n't necessary			1
no one " thought that that was a good idea or needed to be done or should be done , " @entity115 said on " @entity117			0
" the @entity0 obtained a copy of the book and reported that the president 's top aides conducted " extensive group - sessions and polling in late 2011 " to gauge whether dumping @entity70 could help bolster @entity73 's waning re-election hopes			1
the book says @entity115 spearheaded the effort , despite their " close personal rapport , " before ultimately deciding against the move when data showed that adding @entity71 to the ticket would n't " materially improve @entity73 's odds			1
" @entity115 pushed back on the notion			0
" not for a moment was there a serious discussion or a belief that @entity70 should be replaced , period , " said @entity115 , a @entity117 contributor			2
a difficult political year like @entity76 said , @entity115 admitted that it was something he considered and that polling and research were done to explore the possibility because it was his job to " look outside the box			0
" " but in 2011 , " @entity115 said , " it was a very difficult political year , and so my sense was we ought to look at everything here because this is a very -- it was a very difficult period , politically			0
" polls conducted by @entity19 at the time showed that the president was struggling politically a year out from @entity154 2012			0
in the late summer and fall of 2011 , @entity73 's approval ratings hovered around 45 % , a 10 - point drop from january of that year			2
there was much speculation over whether @entity70 would be on a second - term ticket in late 2011 and early 2012			2
@entity162 wrote on @entity19 in october 2011 that @entity77 sources told him that the president was " very high " on @entity70 and " deeply appreciates his advice			2
" he said he asked @entity71 , then secretary of state , if it was something she would consider but she said , " no. " @entity73 's former deputy press secretary , @entity170 , told @entity19 's @entity171 in january 2012 , " even privately , president @entity73 would tell you that one of the best decisions he 's ever made in politics was putting vice president @entity70 on his ticket			1
" " he 's not leaving the ticket , " @entity170 added			0
according to @entity181 , the @entity0 ' national political correspondent , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the @entity77 , namely @entity115 , to measure what effect swapping @entity71 for @entity70 would have on the polls			1
the potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the @entity191 campaign infrastructure and inside the @entity192			0
only half a dozen of the president 's closest advisers -- including @entity115 , former @entity73 campaign chief @entity196 , and former @entity77 senior advisers @entity197 and @entity199 -- knew the change was under consideration			1
@entity196 , @entity199 and @entity197 took to @entity202 to push back on the report			0
@entity199 denied the @entity77 or the campaign ever contemplated the swap			0
" never any consideration of ( @entity70 - for - @entity71 ) switch , " @entity199 wrote in a tweet			1
the move was " not ever entertained by the only person who mattered			0
back to @entity213 , " he added			0
@entity197 tweeted : " vp swap never in play			0
@entity70 's taken on many tough assignments			2
he 's been loyal friend and wise counselor			0
@entity218 lucky to have him , " @entity197 wrote friday			0
and @entity196 said : " let me be clear : @entity221 - @entity220 switch never considered by @entity218 or anyone who mattered in the campaign			0
# sillyseason " a significant investment but @entity23 pointed out that it was , in fact , considered			0
@entity23 told @entity19 's @entity227 the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay dividends at the polls			2
" campaigns do n't spend the kind of money on polling and focus groups unless they 're seriously considering something , " he said on @entity19 's " @entity233			1
" he said on the program that he asked @entity115 whether his then - boss knew about the potential shuffle			0
while @entity115 said he does n't think the president " was aware " of the potential change , the former chief of staff admitted that it 's " possible " @entity73 knew			2
@entity23 added that " @entity26 " does not definitively answer whether the political probing reached @entity73 's desk			1
as to whether @entity71 knew , @entity115 said on @entity117 that if she did know , she " did n't find out from me			2
