-- @entity1 pulled no punches on his show monday night , the first since @entity5 confirmed the tv host was being kicked out of his low - rated 10 p.m. slot after just three months			1
" welcome to ' the @entity8			0
' as you know , we 're not just a show anymore , we are now a collector 's item , " he said to open the show , before launching into a string of scathing one - liners making not - so - light of the situation			2
@entity18 , chairman of @entity19 , announced sunday that the network was taking @entity1 -- formerly the host of " @entity22 " now helmed by @entity23 -- out of the prime - time slot because the show " did n't meet affiliates ' needs " despite performing at acceptable levels for the network			1
the last show will air february 11 to make way for the @entity32 , which airs starting february 12			0
" @entity5 said the show performed exactly as they expected it would and then canceled us			1
do n't confuse this when we were on at late night and performed better than expected and they canceled us			0
that was totally different , " @entity1 quipped			2
@entity18 said the plan now is for @entity1 to host a new , half - hour show at 11:35 p.m. et , followed by " tonight " with @entity23 at 12:05 a.m. and @entity42 's " @entity43 " show moving to 1 a.m. @entity23 had his own zingers for @entity5 during his monologue monday night			1
among them : -- " good evening , i 'm @entity23 , the new host of ' @entity48 with @entity49			1
' " -- " this weekend no one was seriously hurt , but a 6.5 earthquake hit @entity51			2
the earthquake was so powerful that it knocked @entity1 's show from 10:00 to 11:35			1
" -- " on the positive side , i have learned a valuable lesson from all this : never sign a contract that ends with the word ' not			0
' " as of sunday , @entity5 was still negotiating with the three hosts over the proposed line - up			1
" supposedly we 're moving to 11:30			0
even this is not for sure			0
@entity65 's people are upset			2
hey , @entity5 said it wanted drama at 10:00 -- now they 've got it ! everyone 's mad , " @entity1 said monday night			1
before turning his monologue to other current events , @entity1 had one last piece of mud to sling : " i take pride in one thing			2
i leave @entity5 prime time the same way i found it -- a complete disaster			1
" @entity5 moved @entity1 to the prime time slot in september with " the @entity8 , " a decision that raised eyebrows in the industry			1
in an unprecedented move , @entity5 was pitting a talk show up against the hourlong dramas that have typically done well at 10 p.m. although @entity1 's ratings were on target with @entity5 's expectations , the low average of nightly viewers left affiliates feeling the brunt of " the @entity1 effect , " causing the ratings for nightly news to drop			1
this announcement fueled rumors that @entity23 , who took @entity1 's spot on " @entity22 " in 2009 , is considering making an exit			1
@entity100 , a spokesman for @entity101 , had no comment on whether the network had reached out to offer @entity23 his own show			2
@entity101 reportedly went after him six years ago , which led to @entity5 offering him the " @entity22 " chair after @entity1 's eventual departure			1
" this is still being sorted out , " said @entity108 , editor in chief of the industry trade publication @entity111 , who added that he expects the network to reach a conclusion over the next few days			0
" the bottom line is that @entity5 has decided -- correctly or incorrectly -- that they 're going to try and keep all their late - night talent			2
that 's very expensive and a very questionable strategy			0
" @entity108 thinks it 's very likely @entity1 will remain at 11:30 post-negotiations			2
" i just do n't know that you need to pay that much money in late - night			0
i think you pick two hosts , one at 11:30 and one at 12:30			0
" out of the three hosts , @entity23 is the clear loser , @entity108 says			0
even if @entity23 were to stick it out with @entity5 , getting bumped back to 12:05 is not optimal , said @entity132 , a 20 - year tv veteran and attorney who produces " @entity134			1
" " pushing it back half an hour is huge , " @entity132 said			0
" the later in the night you go , the fewer people that are watching			0
[ that 's ] going back to a time slot where it 's the ' @entity143 ' again			0
" the whole scenario recalls the precedent set by a similar @entity5 fiasco 17 years ago , @entity132 said , when @entity1 and @entity147 were dueling over " @entity22			1
" after failing to secure the " @entity22 " position succeeding @entity150 , " @entity147 was able to break out of his contract [ with @entity5 ] , " @entity132 said			0
" it set legal precedence because they wanted to keep @entity147 , but he jumped ship through an escape clause			0
" @entity5 's talk shuffle : the right move ? share your view the effect of that incident has been reverberating through @entity5 for years , he added			2
" it 's a karmic thing for them , " @entity132 said			0
" you would think that @entity5 would have learned			0
" @entity165 , however , does n't believe people should be shedding tears for @entity23			1
" @entity65 has a chance to destroy everybody , " the comedian said while on a press tour for his new show , " @entity171 " " i do n't think anyone 's done anything to @entity65			1

new : @entity65 : earthquake so powerful " it knocked @entity1 's show from 10:00 to 11:35 "
@entity1 : " i leave @entity5 prime time the same way i found it -- a complete disaster "
@entity5 is still negotiating contracts for @entity1 , @entity185 , @entity23
@entity165 : " @entity65 has the chance to destroy everybody "
