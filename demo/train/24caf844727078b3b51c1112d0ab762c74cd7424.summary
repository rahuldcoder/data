@entity0 -- a hacker 's invasion of dozens of celebrity @entity5 accounts , leading to the embarrassing leaking of nude photos , has lessons for us all			1
here are five things you should know about what happened			0
who 's been hacked ? there 's a list of 100 celebrity women -- and one man -- whose photos were supposedly downloaded and stolen by a hacker			1
it includes a-listers , notably @entity23 - winning actress @entity24 , and d - listers whose names you may not recognize			1
many of them only found out they were victims because of media reports naming them , but others -- such as @entity32 -- found out when social networks exploded with buzz about nude photos being distributed online			2
@entity32 and two others , actress @entity37 and model - actress @entity38 , almost immediately confirmed the images were of them			2
several others -- including singer @entity41 , gymnast @entity42 and singer - actress @entity43 -- said photos supposed to be of them were fakes			2
justice later tweeted that she did , in fact , suffer " a serious violation of privacy , " with real photos leaked			0
while @entity52 is on the list , it might have been a waste of a hacker 's energy , because the singer is known for frequently sharing revealing photos of herself on @entity58 and @entity59			1
being on the hacked celebrity list does n't mean the hackers actually found any racy photos			1
actress - singer @entity65 , 21 , was on the list , but has never taken or kept nude photos on her phone or elsewhere , her mother said			1
the former @entity70 star , now playing @entity71 on @entity72 , was taught early in her career about the dangers , she said			0
others reportedly hacked include : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			2
the one male on the list is actor @entity97 , but to the disappointment of some female fans , no nude photos of @entity97 have emerged			1
why would celebrities have nude photos of themselves on their cell phones ? there may not be one answer for this , but distance from love interests could be a major factor			1
actors spend months away from spouses and lovers while making movies			0
musicians tour the world for months			0
sexting can become a substitute for intimacy when a relationship goes long distance			0
of course , some bathroom mirror selfies may be snapped and kept as a way to measure progress on a diet or to assess the need for a tummy tuck or update with the plastic surgeon			0
other celebs , however , have enjoyed career boosts when supposedly inadvertent leaks of nude photos or videos have gone viral			1
her career highlight was as @entity135 's personal assistant before the world discovered her sex tape			2
another way nude photos might find their way onto a celebrity 's cell phone is just plain @entity143 ©			1
maybe they do n't realize images on their iphones are automatically backed up by @entity5 , or perhaps they thought @entity5 was a safe place for their data			1
how did the hacking happen ? the hacker apparently took advantage of a security flaw in @entity154 's online backup service , @entity5			1
many online services lock someone out after several unsuccessful attempts to log in , but not @entity154 's " @entity159 " app and @entity5			1
that has been changed by @entity154 in the aftermath of the nude celebrity photo scandal			1
but with unlimited guesses , a computer program can generate and test thousands of potential passwords until an account is entered			2
it is called a " brute force " attack			0
the tendency of many people to choose weak passwords and to use the same password for each service helped			2
once a celebrity 's " @entity159 " app password is discovered , the same password often can access @entity5			1
people might never know their accounts have been compromised			0
another thing makes the famous more vulnerable			0
@entity181 and many other websites provide biographical information that can help a hacker guess passwords or answers to security questions			1
nearly a decade ago , @entity135 's @entity188 cell phone was accessed when a hacker guessed her password was @entity191 , the name of her famous teacup chihuahua			1
@entity154 said on tuesday that the company 's core computer systems , which house all its users ' data , were not hacked			1
" certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names , passwords and security questions , a practice that has become all too common on the @entity204 , " @entity154 said			1

choose strong , hard - to - guess passwords			1
long but easy to remember pass phrases that include numbers are suggested			0
have variations for different email accounts , bank accounts and apps			0
if one is hacked , it does not compromise your entire virtual world			2
many services , including @entity154 's , offer the option of two - factor authentication			1
after you enter your permanent password , you are asked for a second temporary password or number that is automatically generated and sent to you in a text message			0
a hacker would not have been able to access those celebrity photos unless he or she also had the celebrity 's cell phone			1
another safeguard is to be aware that even when you delete a photo or video from your @entity159 , it is possibly backed up by @entity5			2
the service allows you to access images on all your devices , but it also keeps those you might think are deleted			0
actress @entity37 tweeted that the photos of her that were leaked were " deleted long ago			0

@entity24 's representatives said investigators have been contacted and " will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of @entity24			0
" the @entity257 's @entity0 office confirmed monday that it was investigating the hacking			0
" the @entity257 is aware of the allegations concerning computer @entity262 and the unlawful release of material involving high - profile individuals , and is addressing the matter , " the agency 's spokeswoman said			2
the same office caught a @entity270 man who hacked celebrity email accounts in 2011			0
@entity272 , whose targets included actresses @entity274 and @entity276 and singer @entity277 , was charged with accessing protected computers without authorization , damaging protected computers , wiretapping and aggravated identity theft			0
@entity282 is serving a 10 - year federal prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2012			0
the hackers arrested in the @entity135 case , including a teenager , got jail time , too			0
what is the cloud ?			0

the hacked list includes a-listers plus d - listers whose names you may not recognize
celebs may take nude pics to send to partners when away at film shoots
the hacker apparently took advantage of a now - fixed security flaw in @entity154 's @entity5
strong , hard - to - guess passwords and two - factor *verfication* can protect you
