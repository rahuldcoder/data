-- an @entity2 contractor said thursday that the @entity2 mission in @entity4 will be undermined if the @entity4 government succeeds in revoking blanket legal immunity for @entity2 security contractors			1

@entity11 reacted to a wednesday government report that said the removal of legal immunity for @entity2 private security contractors could set off an " exodus " from war - ravaged @entity4 and " impose significant limitations " on @entity2 reconstruction efforts			1
the scenario is outlined in the quarterly report issued to @entity22 by the @entity23			0
@entity11 , whose firm builds bases for the @entity4 army and police and supplies those places with water , food , fuel and maintenance services , said that about 40 percent of his staff is involved in security			1
" we would undermine the @entity2 mission here because they are so reliant on contractors , " said @entity11 , co-founder of the @entity2 - @entity35			2
" for better or for worse , that 's reality			0
" even though 90 percent of his employees are @entity4 , he fears that new laws could force him to shut down			0
but the " exodus " comment in the report also prompted skepticism from a scholar who studies the subject			2
@entity50 , a @entity51 scholar who is an authority on private security firms , said , " i do n't think we should worry about a market collapse , so to speak			1
there 's simply too much money to be made			0
" the @entity4 government has criticized the blanket immunity because of the actions of security contractors , such as the september shootings in @entity10 of @entity4 citizens that involved @entity66 contractors			1
seventeen people died in that incident			0
" from a relief and reconstruction perspective , one of the most critical issues under discussion is contractor immunity , " the inspector general 's report says			1
" existing agreements provide @entity2 contractors in @entity4 with blanket immunity from prosecution under @entity4 law			1
but [ the government of @entity4 ] is seeking to modify , if not eliminate , that immunity			2
such action would acutely affect the status of private security contractors in @entity4			1
" the issue of immunity has been part of the ongoing talks trying to create a long - term security agreement between the @entity2 and @entity4 after the @entity93 mandate defining the role of @entity2 troops ends at the end of the year			1
@entity4 simply want contractors to abide by their laws			2
@entity4 foreign minister @entity99 said this month that negotiators have agreed to drop the legal immunity for contractors , but a formal announcement has not been made			1
the inspector general estimates that about 70 private security companies have operated in the country since 2003 , with cumulative contract values totaling approximately $ 4.5 billion			1
the inspector general report says the @entity2 has " appropriated more than $ 50 billion in taxpayer dollars for @entity4 's reconstruction			2
" asked about the report , @entity66 spokeswoman @entity111 said , " i am confident the @entity4 government and the @entity2 government for whom we work will come to some sort of an agreement that will represent both of their interests			2
" if anything does change with the immunity law , " we 're standing by for direction from our @entity2 government clients , " she said			0
@entity126 , the special inspector general , elaborated on the reference to security contractors in the report , saying he believes that changes in immunity are " going to have a very real economic impact , " particularly with the provincial reconstruction teams operating in the @entity4 provinces			1
although there has n't been a formal announcement about the status of immunity , he believes that the blanket immunity measure for contractors that was developed by the @entity140 will be significantly modified at the very least			0
he said security contractors are the main target , but he said non-security contractors also would be subject to @entity4 law if immunity is revoked			1
he raised the issue of insurance costs , saying the removal of immunity could jack up such costs for security and other contractors			2
@entity126 says one result he can foresee is the growth of homegrown @entity4 security firms			1
" clearly , if you ca n't use @entity2 security contractors , then you will have to use other contractors , " such as those from @entity160 , the @entity162 region or @entity4 , he said			1
@entity50 said the issue of immunity has been discussed for some time , and contractors have had " a lot of lead time to figure out what 's going on here			0
this is n't something new			0
" " you 've got around 190,000 private military contractors out there , doing all sorts of roles , everything from armed security work to logistics and running base operations and things like that			2
they work for all sorts of hundreds of different companies			0
and again they 're coming from around the world			0
" he points out that the marketplace for security in @entity4 is a big one , with @entity2 a minority in an industry that includes @entity4 and other third - country nationalities			2
" you may well see some companies decide they want to leave , but they 're going to evaluate what 's in their own interests and other companies are going to decide what 's in their own interest			0
this is , i would argue , a good thing because it 's trying to take @entity4 and turn it into what is a more natural setting , where that government is in charge of the operations of what 's happening on the ground from a legal standpoint			0
" @entity11 said the removal of immunity would have a big impact on his business			0
" you 've still got remnants of the insurgents out there			0
you 've still got ... the thieves			0
so , you 've still got to have convoy security , " said @entity11 , whose firm has won a quarter of a billion dollars in defense contracts			0
a security contractor , who asked not to be named because he could lose his job for talking to reporters , said he believes a removal of immunity would have a chilling effect for contractors			1
he said @entity4 contractors taking over security duties have improved but have n't reached the level of proficiency that @entity2 have			1
the contractor , who said he has worked in @entity4 and other countries , believes that @entity240 contractors could be be treated brutally and unfairly			1
" it 's like putting a police officer in the middle of @entity244 , on murderers row with five guys he put away , " the contractor said			0
" they 're not going to get a fair trial			0
" he said individuals would n't want to work as contractors there in such a situation -- or they would demand more money to do it			2
he believes that some firms would pull out because of liability issues or because they could n't find proper security .			0

report says loss of contractor immunity could spark " exodus " from @entity4
contractor says @entity4 reliant on firms like his , " for better or for worse "
scholar skeptical that contractors would leave -- " too much money to be made "
about 70 private security companies have operated in @entity4 since 2003
