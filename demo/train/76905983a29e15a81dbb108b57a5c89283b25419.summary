-- for the first time since the massacre at @entity5 , @entity2 plans do something remarkable on thursday that once was routine : drop her child off at school			1
the last time her 7 - year - old son , @entity9 , was in class was on december 14 , when a gunman smashed his way into his school in @entity15 , @entity16 , and killed 26 children and adults			1
as shots rang out , @entity9 's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways , wielding an @entity27 assault rifle and firing			2
when it appeared safe , the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station , where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed			1
nearly a month later , @entity35 said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises			2
@entity15 chooses faith , charity , hope but on thursday , he will join hundreds of other @entity15 students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy			1
" we think it 's good he 's going back , " @entity35 said			2
" if i leave my child anywhere , i 'm leaving a piece of my heart , so it 's difficult to leave him			0
" ' i think i 'll be ok , ' @entity5 student says after first day but @entity9 apparently is n't afraid and says he 's looking forward to seeing his friends , she said			0
they wo n't be attending @entity60 , which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into @entity64 , the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school			1
instead , @entity9 and his classmates are expected to travel to @entity69 in the nearby town of @entity71 , where a green - and - white banner greeting the children hangs on a fence			1
@entity76 's attorney withdraws lawsuit @entity60 superintendent @entity78 said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school			1
" ( we want ) to have as much ( of ) a normal routine as possible , " she said			0
" ( thursday ) is a regular schedule , and we will do the kinds of things that we know are good for kids			0
" the school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at @entity5 to help ease the transition for students			2
even the school 's pet turtle was relocated , @entity94 said			0
security measures have also been increased , with a new system incorporating more cameras and locks , according to @entity101 , superintendent of @entity102			0
