-- it 's an empirical fact : there are people out there who hate you			0
it does n't matter how nice you are , or how many smiley face stickers and free hugs you dole out , there are probably a couple of people out there who rue the day you were born			1
( likely us , if you do , indeed , dole out " free hugs			0
" ) and never is this animosity so evident as it is on the @entity17			1
think about it : before the advent of the @entity21 , the average person lived in blissful ignorance of the ire of others , only catching whispers on the windblown grapevine of malcontent			0
now , you have the potential to invoke someone 's wrath with every blog entry , @entity34 update and tweet			1
so how does one respond to this digital dislike ? read on , dear readers ( 10 % of whom we likely disdain , and vice versa ) : in the event of a passive - aggressive @entity34 there are more than 650 million people on @entity34 , and unless you 're a solid adherent to @entity45 and have carefully restricted those friend requests , you 're probably " friends " with a couple of people you would n't actually call " friend " in real life			1
you know : high school classmates / tormentors , exes , former friends with whom you 've had a falling out			1
if you were to run into said people on the street , they would probably do the whole , " i 'm staring at this poster for a children 's yard sale that occurred three weeks ago very intently and therefore do not see you " thing			1
on @entity34 , some do the virtual equivalent : they block your access to photos and wall posts , ( likely ) remove you from their news feed and immediately toss out a " not attending " four seconds after you send them an invite to your " @entity74			1
" yup , you 're trapped in " i 'm being polite , but i hate you " limbo , dear friend , and it 's time to go on to the next world : one in which only friends dawdle in the sweet groves of amity			1
translation : unfriend those people posthaste			1
you have to grudgingly tolerate co-workers , extended family and @entity88 - ridden elevator - sharers on a daily basis ; do n't let that same lenience spread into the realm of @entity93 's @entity92			1
in the event of a @entity96 war @entity96 wars have become the modern - day equivalent of the battles between @entity101 gladiators -- epic , public clashes that seem staged for the delight of a packed arena of rapt onlookers			1
we 've seen some pretty intense examples in the realm of the celebrity ( @entity111 , @entity112 and various and sundry reality stars are repeat offenders ) , and , on a less buzzed - about scale , between friends and acquaintances			1
" social networking sites such as @entity34 and @entity96 may bring ( animosity ) out more because of the massive and ready audience they supply , " says @entity118 , @entity119 , a psychiatrist and author of " virtually you : the @entity125 of the @entity126			0
" while the worst thing that could happen to a gladiator was being ripped limb from limb and possibly consumed by a lion , @entity96 warriors face a much more dire ( although less fatal ) fate : an eternally damaged reputation			2
( remember , guys , all of your tweets are being stored in the @entity139 as we speak			0
) why ? because @entity96 fights are not courageous -- they 're tacky			0
if someone slights you in 140 characters , we suggest sending them a @entity147 ( if you give a damn about their opinion ) , or just blocking them and sticking to straight - up schadenfreude when it comes to entertainment			1
in the event of an all - out war if you have a blog , @entity159 channel or prominent place on an online forum dedicated to live action role - playing , you 're going to have to fortify your gates against the trolls			1
the wonderful thing about the @entity17 is that it encourages everyone to have an opinion -- and the horrible thing about the @entity17 is that it affords everyone the ability to express it			1
as a general rule , if an under - the - bridge dweller sends you a mean e-mail , flames you in the comments section of your blog or pontificates on your unattractiveness under your latest cat grooming tutorial on @entity159 , just do n't engage			1
said bumpy - faced one is looking to get a rise out of you , and executing a counterstrike will only result in more wholly eloquent zingers in the " @entity184 " vein			2
sports columnist @entity185 decided to track down and confront his trolls for a @entity0 column and found the whole ordeal to be an exercise in futility			2
" it 's sort of like stomping out ants with your foot , " he says			0
" it works temporarily , but then the ants come back even stronger			0
truthfully , you 're better off pretending these people do n't exist			2
because they 're crying to be noticed ; to have the platform you have			0
engage them , you make their wish come true			2
" still , that does n't mean you have to suffer in martyred silence all the time			2
" we should remember that any information attached to our name , whether it 's accurate information we supply ourselves without thinking or mean - spirited and inaccurate statements made about us by haters , is going to stay online forever , " says @entity118			2
" that is why standing up to hecklers can be an important part of maintaining our online reputation			0
" a simple fix is simply deleting any outright racist , rude or misogynistic comments from your own personal domains , or flagging abusive sentiments on the domains of others , and then contacting the webmaster			0
or , you could be a little more creative			0
there have been some instances in which folks have stood up to trolls in a manner that entirely obliterated the original slight			2
for example , after one commenter posted a scathing -- albeit horrifyingly misspelled -- rant under a game on content creation site @entity232 , the actor who voiced the game teamed up with a graphic designer to create a video dramatizing the venom - tinged words in all of their grammatically incorrect glory			0
that video , " dot dot dot , " went viral , in no small part because it was a clever retort to an impassioned troll , rather than a messy attack			0
the troll in question even " favorited " the video			0
sure , you ca n't make everyone on the web like you			0
but grudging respect is sometimes more satisfying than blind adoration , anyway .			0

a good and *bad* thing about the @entity17 is that it encourages everyone to have an opinion
unfriend passive - aggressive @entity257 who are n't really your friends
as a general rule , do n't engage trolls who send you a mean e-mail or flame you on your blog
