-- @entity1 dropped his serve just once during a two - hour battle with @entity3 at the @entity4 , but it was enough to end the former world no. 1 's 16 - match winning streak			1
@entity1 , who has already clinched three titles in 2012 , boasts a strong record against world @entity10 and has beaten the @entity12 in four major finals among his record 16 grand slam crowns			1

" for me , it was obviously a tough loss , " @entity1 told the tournament 's official website			1
" the one service game where i got broken , he really goes for it and it all works out			2
" i had my chances			0
i thought @entity3 did well to get the first , and then to put me in the situation i guess in the third			1
i could have been up a break early in the third , but he did well also to fight off those break points			0
" @entity3 , a two - time winner in @entity4 , set up a last - 16 tie against @entity35 21st seed @entity34			1
" it was kind of a game of chess , " said @entity3 , also a former world no. 1			1
" i stayed back on the returns , which is something i have not done with him often early on			0
i think he might have been a little bit surprised by it			0
" he started coming in a lot and putting the pressure on me , and it was 6 - 1 in the second and 0 - 40 early in the third			1
it was apparent that that was n't going to work much longer			0
" so i said , ' well , all right			0
let 's kinda go over the top aggressive			2
' i was able to get out of that game and play that really good game to break , and then my serve held up from there			0
" defending champion @entity54 had no such problems , as the world @entity3 won 6 - 3 6 - 4 against fellow @entity59 and 27th seed @entity57 to set up a clash with @entity62 @entity61			1
" generally , i feel that i have been playing well in my first two matches , " the 2012 @entity64 champion said			0
" i did have some ups and downs , especially in today 's match , but i 'm confident that i can raise the level of performance in every match			2
