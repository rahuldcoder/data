-- growing up in the @entity3 , my summers were filled with trips to @entity5 in @entity6 , where my family and i would watch anti-communist plays featuring popular @entity10 actors			0
those trips would include hours - long pig roasts , where family members would animatedly discuss the big policy issues of the day , like the impact of the fall of the @entity16 on @entity18 's government			1
my parents were among the men and women who fled the country in the 1960s , and from them , i learned about human rights abuses , lack of political and press freedoms and other forms of repression , something that helped mold my opinions about @entity3 policy towards @entity18			1
in fact , having grown up in this kind of environment , it should come as little surprise that i 've been a hardliner on @entity3 - @entity18 policy issues			1
but after the better part of three decades , i 'm starting to change my mind			2
indeed , i 've begun to question the 52 - year - old @entity3 embargo against @entity18 , and have grown less and less sure that its continuation is really helping the @entity18 people			1
why ? like many @entity3 - born children of @entity18 exiles , i have a complicated identity			2
but while i will never support @entity18 's current repressive political system , i have started to see how the @entity3 ' embargo against the communist island could bolster government officials there , who can simply blame the embargo for any shortcomings			1
five decades ago , my father boarded a plane from @entity5 to @entity56 and vowed never to return to the island			2
my mother last saw her beloved @entity18 when she left by boat for @entity59 , @entity60 , in 1961			2
she says she saw her family and friends lose their homes and possessions , and told me how other exiles were excoriated as " gusanos , " or worms , for leaving			0
so my recent decision to visit the country for the first time troubled my parents			0
for example , i 'm outspoken about human rights issues , and my mother was worried that i 'd be punished for speaking my mind			0
and remember , this is a country known for its media censorship , a place where just - released @entity3 , @entity78 , sat in jail for five years " for facilitating uncensored internet contact between a small , religious community on the island and the rest of the world			0
" in fact , @entity78 's plight was a topic of discussion among the group of about a dozen of us who went on a tour of @entity18 last november that was organized by the @entity95 - based nonprofit organization @entity94 , whose mission is " to facilitate commerce and understanding between the businesses and governments of the @entity102			2
" during my politically active teen years and into my 20s , when i protested the @entity3 decision to send @entity104 home and had anti-communism banners and @entity107 quotes adorning my dorm room , i vowed not to visit the island until the current dictatorship was part of @entity18 's distant past			1
yet here i was , in my early 30s , hearing directly from @entity18 officials , economists , professors , students , musicians and others			1
we also visited the @entity3 chief of mission while we were in @entity5			0
and i was pleasantly surprised that some of our guest speakers openly criticized government policies , talking about everything from the need for more private business to their dismay that the government had shut down beloved @entity132 theaters , arguing they 'd never been authorized			0
this is n't to say that i was n't exposed to things that troubled me , even during this short trip : i saw billboards filled with socialist propaganda , there was clearly a lack of press freedom , and there is the fact that even though they 're highly educated , @entity18 still do n't earn a decent wage : the average @entity18 earns 20 @entity18 dollars a month -- about $ 20 usd			2
but this last fact highlighted to me one of the strongest arguments against the embargo -- that it harms average @entity18 , rather than the government			1
and i know i 'm far from the only one hoping for an end to the embargo			0
as noted by @entity0 , millennials of @entity10 descent are generally in favor of ending the embargo , with one poll noting that more than half of @entity156 surveyed in @entity6 wanted an end to the embargo , while a solid majority of them also favored restoring diplomatic relations with @entity5			0
across the water , many of the college age students i spoke to said they 'd like to see government reform , and they told me that they yearn for more access to information on the island			1
part of their desire comes from meeting young @entity156 and other visitors from the @entity3 who discuss some of the freedoms many of us take for granted , including the right to protest and express ourselves without repercussions from state officials			0
all this said , i can never personally forgive the decades - long human rights abuses in my parents ' homeland			0
but ultimately , opening dialogue between @entity18 on the island and overseas would be a good start on the path of trying to repair a long and painful rift			1
if we can embark on this journey , then we might be able to help those young @entity18 with whom i spoke to secure some of the freedoms that so many of us here take for granted			1
