-- it is the one event in the golfing calendar where @entity4 stars add some gliltz and glamor to golf 's premier @entity8 pro-am event			1
but this year , the great and good from @entity10 might be forgiven for keeping their distance from @entity15 's @entity14 royalty in @entity16			1
several of the pivotal members of the victorious @entity15 team are back to the day job after one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time in @entity22			0
both actor @entity23 and 18 - time olympic gold medal winning swimmer @entity25 were at @entity26 , as the @entity10 sunk to defeat from a seemingly unassailable position			1
but though @entity31 , who holed the crucial putt that meant the @entity10 could not win back the @entity14 , @entity29 and @entity30 were playing , @entity28 was still delighted to be involved			1
" with all the history that is around you here , on these great courses , it is just an honour for me to play in this tournament , " @entity28 told the @entity8 's official website			2
" i was a bit nervous on the first tee , but it was n't too bad			0
to be honest , it was more nerve - wracking watching the @entity14 last week ! " my partner @entity44 was awesome to play with , and there were some good comments going back and forth between us during the round			2
he gave me some great tips and , by the end , was just telling me to hit it hard ! " as well as the trio of @entity15 players all four of @entity55 's vice captains were playing , including 2011 @entity58 open @entity56 and @entity59 , who was playing with @entity61 400m champion @entity60			2
the @entity62 , known as ' @entity60 ' , birdied the second hole at the notoriously difficult @entity65 course and has two more rounds to come , at @entity67 and @entity69 ' famous old course			2
" it was very stressful for me this morning , " said @entity60			0
" it was a nervous time on that first tee , and i was just glad to get the ball past the ladies ' tee ! but then i got that net birdie and overall the day was an unbelievable experience for me			0
" to play with @entity29 and to be in a four - ball with ( 2010 @entity15 @entity14 captain ) @entity80 and ( five - time olympic gold medalist ) @entity82 was brilliant , especially as @entity82 and i have known each other a long time and we are good friends			1
" but we did n't have a bet -- we kept it clean ! there was a bit of a competitive spirit between us , so perhaps we 'll have a little match later in the tournament			2
" of all the @entity14 contingent it was @entity31 who fared the best , the @entity96 shooting a two - under - par round at @entity65			1
the 27 - year - old has had a hectic week after his famous putt in @entity22 , but said he was glad to be back out on the course			0
" there have been plenty of congratulations , " he said			0
" it 's a very nice feeling to come to @entity69 and to come here to @entity65 , and a lot of people were rooting for us on sunday obviously and they were watching			0
it 's very nice to hear			0
" if you put everything in consideration : we won last week @entity14 , this week i get to play with my manager and friend , @entity111 ( @entity112 ) , my brother is caddying for him , we 're playing some of the best golf courses in the world , it 's nice weather ; so it 's tough to beat			1
" @entity31 's solid round was nothing compared to tournament leader @entity124 , who made an eagle and 10 birdies to break @entity128 's @entity67 course record with a round of 60			1
the @entity62 is on 12 - under , two shots clear of @entity132 @entity131 , who broke the course record at @entity69 with a round of 62 -- topping @entity136 's feat from the @entity137 .			0
