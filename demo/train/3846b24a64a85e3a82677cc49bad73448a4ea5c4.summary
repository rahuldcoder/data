@entity0 -- @entity2 has spent the final moments of the midterm campaign season publicly deflecting the flurry of questions about her likely run for president			1
but behind the scenes , her campaign machine is quietly whirring to life			0
@entity14 insiders have begun to approach @entity0 - based @entity16 operatives who may play a role in a potential campaign and are soliciting their recommendations on other possible staffers , according to @entity16 familiar with the conversations			1
a number @entity14 associates are compiling staffing lists , according to multiple @entity16 sources			1
@entity26 and @entity27 of the @entity16 communications and consulting firm @entity29 are one conduit to @entity14 's inner circle and among the primary compilers of the campaign universe that will surround @entity14 , should she run			1
the firm is led by veteran players in @entity14 world			0
@entity26 was an adviser to vice president @entity37 and a @entity14 campaign aide while @entity27 is a longtime @entity14 confidante			1
@entity39 , head of communications for @entity41 , said the characterization is " incorrect			0
" " @entity29 officials have no role " in a potential @entity14 campaign , she said			1
operatives at the firm are reviewing possible @entity14 staffers " under the guise of spitballing ideas , " as one @entity16 source put it			1
with a trio of pro-hillary @entity53 -- ready for @entity2 , @entity55 and @entity56 -- months into shoring up support , a @entity14 campaign is already well underway outside of her inner circle			1
@entity14 's midterm campaign schedule " the reality is that if you have a message and you 're larger than life , the organization can come together pretty quickly , " said @entity60 , who served as deputy campaign director for @entity63 's 2004 campaign			2
" it can be a turnkey operation			0
" as the @entity14 campaign apparatus is constructed , those close to her are trying to shroud it from view , wary of the glaring political spotlight that amplifies every move the former secretary of state makes			2
" there are no formal talks , no one is being offered jobs , " one source told @entity1 , dismissing the signs of campaign life as " a lot of jockeying " from @entity16 who want to work on a @entity14 campaign			2
in september , @entity14 and her inner circle were dismayed by a leak to @entity91 that revealed the presence of @entity93 -- former chief of staff to president @entity14 , current top aide to president @entity96 and the person favored to serve as chairman of a @entity2 campaign -- at meetings with @entity102 super pacs this summer			1
@entity103 , one of @entity14 's closest aides , has told multiple @entity16 to rein in chatter about 2016 , saying @entity14 wants to keep attention on the midterm elections and minimize attention on a presidential run , according to a @entity16 source who spoke to @entity103			2
@entity14 and the small team she employs are trying to keep her out of the tarnishing political spotlight until she is ready to make a run official , something @entity14 will likely do by the end of winter , though she would like to put it off as late as possible			1
" if there 's not a competitive primary , the general election starts as soon as she declares , " said @entity118 , former deputy campaign manager for @entity120 's 2012 presidential run , who says the challenge of a @entity14 campaign will be more of what her current team is already struggling with -- '' how do they keep her fresh for the @entity126 people ? " recent campaigns for viable @entity16 or @entity133 presidential candidates were well into the preliminary phase of staffing up at this point in time , with top aides already getting in line ahead of an official announcement			1
in 2012 , @entity142 , at the time the executive director of @entity120 's @entity140 and later @entity120 's campaign manager , was already in early discussions with all of those who would become senior staff			0
well before the 2006 midterms , then - sen. @entity96 had conducted preliminary discussions with and identified a number of top aides			0
his campaign effectively went into high gear after the elections , though he launched his exploratory committee in january 2007 and declared his candidacy in february			0
but some political operatives warn not to read too much into the beginning phase of a @entity14 campaign currently underway			1
" of course the preliminary conversations should be going on , " said @entity157 , deputy campaign manager for @entity159 's 2004 campaign			0
" but there are a lot of people who have had those conversations - who thought about running for office , made plans to run for office , and did n't			0
" among those believed to be part of a potential @entity14 campaign , @entity169 , the current executive director of the @entity170 , appears to be one of @entity14 's most likely choices for campaign manager , according to interviews with more than two dozen @entity16			2
" even if @entity16 do n't hang onto the @entity179 , people respect the job that he 's done , " said one			0
@entity169 's role is expected to fall under the oversight of @entity93 , seen as a calming force who could squash much of the internal drama that plagued @entity14 's 2008 campaign			2
@entity93 is expected to stay at the @entity187 through the @entity188 , according to two sources familiar with his current plans , despite his initial commitment of one year service when @entity96 named him to his post in the @entity195 last december			0
by last @entity196 , @entity197 , who managed the campaign that propelled @entity14 fundraising guru , @entity201 , into the @entity204 governor 's mansion , has " been on ice " - as one @entity206 put it - since as early as the spring , according to two @entity16 familiar with the discussion			1
he was told not to make long term plans by those close to @entity14 , the sources say , and is widely expected to play a major role in running the campaign			0
@entity214 , who manages fundraising for the @entity215 and served as @entity2 's deputy chief of protocol at the @entity218 , is the frontrunner for finance director , according to multiple @entity16			0
@entity103 , as well as longtime @entity14 aide @entity220 and @entity221 , @entity14 's current spokesperson , are expected to serve in influential roles in and around the campaign .			0

@entity2 is n't saying whether she *'ll* run for president
but behind the scenes , @entity14 associates are beginning to put together a campaign
