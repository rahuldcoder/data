@entity0 , @entity1 -- at a hospital in northeastern @entity1 , the remnants of lives stolen in seconds are scattered on each of its four floors			1
metal beds are bent , @entity12 bags are filled with muddy water , and blood pressure monitors sit underneath splintered trees			2
but @entity18 nurse @entity17 does n't just see the damage , she hears the haunted screams of the patients she could not save			1
" the patients could n't walk , " said @entity22 , recalling the moment the tsunami hit			1
" i heard someone screaming , ' @entity27 , i ca n't save you			0
' then she ran out of the room			0
" @entity22 said a glance out of the window revealed a wave as high as the fourth floor			0
the nurse said she told the patient " i 'm sorry " as she raced up the stairs			1
" if i tried to save this person who was lying on the bed , i would have lost my life as well , " she said			0
@entity22 pauses , grief etched on her face			0
" it is the biggest regret i have , " she said of leaving patients behind			1
the tsunami following the 9.0 - magnitude earthquake on march 11 engulfed every floor of the hospital just as @entity22 stepped onto the roof			1
at least 10,901 were killed nationwide			0
of the 51 patients hospitalized , doctors and nurses could not move 12 and they drowned in their beds , said @entity55 , a medical director at the hospital			1
one patient died as the hospital staff moved him to the roof while two more died on the frigid roof awaiting rescue			2
" ten of my staff also died with the patients , " @entity55 said			2
the doctor lost his staff , his patients and the hospital he proudly called his home			1
his wife remains missing and is presumed dead			1
as soon as rescuers plucked the doctor from the engulfed building , he started working from a makeshift clinic on higher ground			0
the doctor 's composure cracks as he lifts a handwritten note from a satellite phone sitting in his clinic			2
" @entity80 is helping us from heaven , " he reads , referring to a 60 - year - old hospital administrator , @entity80 , set to retire in april			2
after the tsunami warning , @entity55 asked @entity80 to find the satellite phone on the first floor of the hospital			1
satellite phones are vital lines of communication after a natural disaster because phone lines are usually knocked out			0
@entity80 got the phone and moments before a massive wave swallowed him , tossed it to a colleague , who ran to the roof			0
seconds later , the tsunami engulfed the hospital			1
his sacrifice is part of the reason @entity55 wo n't leave this clinic , now fully operational and treating patients across @entity0			1
his fellow survivors tirelesslesly work along him			0
@entity22 , who brought her elderly and sick mother to the clinic , said the doctors and nurses ca n't feel guilty for surviving the disaster			1
" when i hear that , " she said , " it breaks my heart			0
it 's a natural disaster			2
they want to save everyone , but in this situation , they ca n't			0
" @entity22 said she is grateful to see familiar faces of her colleagues , and hope they realize they are making a difference in the present			0
she pushes her pain -- the loss of her home , her friends and her relatives -- to the back of her mind as she focuses on her patients			2
the town has given her not just a refuge from the pain , but donations of clothes for days she 's not wearing her nurse uniform			1
" whatever the situation , i will stay here			0
talking with the patients will be my cure			2
i feel like i 'm not the one taking care of others , but the one being taken care of , " she said .			0

doctors , nurses focus on caring for patients despite their losses
the medical director 's wife is missing , but he refuses to leave the hospital
" it is the biggest regret i have , " a nurse says of leaving patients behind
