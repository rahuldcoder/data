-- the question of whether or not @entity2 had a wife is back again			1
this week two authors came out with a book about a newly translated ancient text -- a " @entity8 , " as the book calls it			1
the text has been in the possession of the @entity11 since 1847 but only in recent years attracted scholars ' attention			2
it suggests that @entity2 was not only married but had two children , and that @entity16 -- long viewed as a close friend of @entity2 -- was indeed the @entity18			1
it also suggests that there had been an assassination attempt on the children of @entity2 and @entity18 more than a decade before the @entity23 , when @entity2 was 20			1
could it all be true ? this may sound vaguely reminiscent of " the @entity26 , " which @entity27 published in 2003 , but in truth questions about the relationship between @entity2 and @entity16 have been around for a long time , and the " @entity8 " only adds to the legend			1
as to its validity , scholars will be weighing in heavily , like they did when a fragment of another lost gospel was revealed by @entity36 , a professor at @entity37 , almost two years ago			1
that scrap of papyrus was not a forgery , as many at the time believed			0
carbon dating recently confirmed its origin in eighth century @entity44 , although it 's a more recent text than @entity36 originally thought			0
these new claims about a possible " fifth gospel " are made by professor @entity47 of @entity48 in @entity49 and @entity50 , an @entity51 - @entity49 writer and filmmaker			1
their painstaking work on this text , called " the @entity56 of @entity57 , " was written on animal skin in @entity59 , a dialect of @entity61 , the language that @entity2 spoke			1
there is , in fact , a lot of literature in @entity59 , which became an important literary language in the @entity68 , especially after the fourth century			0
the new " gospel " was apparently bought from an @entity44 monastery in the mid- 19th - century and brought to @entity70 , though its exact origins remain obscure			2
" @entity76 scrutinized the document and discarded it as insignificant , " writes @entity74 in the @entity75			0
it wo n't be the first " lost gospel			2
" the idea that @entity2 may have been married to @entity16 was popularized by the wonderful @entity82 novelist @entity81 in " @entity83 " in 1953			1
@entity84 made a movie out of it in 1988			0
@entity27 only jumped on an already moving bandwagon with " the @entity26			1
" the text described in this newest " @entity8 " is said to be a translation from an original @entity82 manuscript , according to a letter dating to the sixth century that accompanied the @entity59 text in the @entity11 , says a @entity95 article on the book			0
no matter how you look at this narrative , it is ancient in origin and may indeed reach back to the first century , when the four canonical gospels -- @entity102 -- were written , although this is @entity47 and @entity103 's conjecture			2
the @entity59 story is n't even directly about @entity2			1
it 's written in code , centering on a man called @entity108 , a kind of @entity2 substitute			2
his wife is called @entity112 and is said to stand in for @entity16			1
in this tale , @entity108 is called the " son of @entity119 , " and there are passages that seem to parallel the language of @entity117			0
@entity108 and @entity112 are married by the @entity44 pharaoh , who pronounces at their wedding : " @entity123 are you by the lord @entity119 of @entity108 , because he is the first - born of @entity119 , and you will be called the daughter of @entity126 and the bride of @entity108 now and for ever			0
" it 's worth recalling that many gospels were composed in the decades , even centuries , after @entity2 -- not only the four that @entity130 acknowledge			1
these include the well - known gospels of @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0
the so - called @entity138 gospels , which came to light in 1945 in the @entity44 desert at @entity141 , contain numerous writings from early @entity143 , including a complete gospel of @entity133 and partial versions of gospels of @entity147 and @entity18 , among others			0
it was not until the end of the second century that @entity151 , the influential @entity152 , did his level best to make sure that only @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 were regarded as the four pillars of @entity143			0
he wanted to stamp out numerous texts with competing claims for scriptural authority			1
so what should @entity130 believe when new material about @entity2 appears ? could there be other gospels that tell us more than we can learn from @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157 ? could @entity2 , for instance , have had a wife and children ? what role did @entity16 play in his life ? it 's obvious that @entity16 was close to @entity2			1
she called him " rabboni , " in @entity61 , meaning teacher			0
she was there at the foot of the cross and was the first to visit the tomb after his death			0
would anyone but a wife have come to see the body of a recently crucified man ? this seems like an intimate act			0
and @entity2 revealed himself to her when he rose from the dead before anyone else			2
in the first century , it would have been typical of a rabbi to have a wife			0
and we know that @entity134 , a close disciple of @entity2 , had a wife , as @entity2 went to visit @entity134 's sick mother - in - law			1
as it were , we hear nothing about the actual wife of @entity134 or the possible wives of other disciples			0
the accepted -- or canonical -- gospels do n't say that @entity2 had a wife			1
if he did , they would probably have mentioned such an important piece of biographical data			0
but it 's useful to remember that the gospel tradition is rich and varied , full of fascinating material that is n't necessarily canonical			0
and we ca n't know exactly what is and what is n't authentic among the voluminous early writings about @entity2			2
myself , i doubt this @entity59 text is more than a fantasy , an early version of " the @entity26			2
" jesus stories were abundant after his death , forcing his followers to pick and choose among many texts that might have spiritual value			0
the @entity223 made its selection , pushing into the margins those gospel writings and ancillary religious texts deemed heretical			2
interest in these materials should surprise nobody , though one should always take the claims of these texts , and those who promote them , with a grain of salt .			1

@entity237 : new book based on ancient texts appears to show @entity2 married with 2 kids
@entity237 : it suggests @entity16 his wife ; scholars leery , sounds like " @entity26 "
he says ' lost gospels ' nothing new . a long ago *bishop* brought it to 4 , to cull competing claims
@entity237 : *christian* *church* made its choice on @entity2 story ; take other claims with grain of salt
