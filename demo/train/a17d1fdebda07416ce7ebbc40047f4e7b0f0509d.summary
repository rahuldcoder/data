-- @entity1 has weighed in on a practice by some businesses asking employees or job applicants for their passwords to the popular social - media site			1
in a nutshell ? @entity1 says do n't do it unless you want to get sued			0
" this practice undermines the privacy expectations and the security of both the user and the user 's friends , " @entity10 , the site 's chief privacy officer , wrote friday on the site 's @entity1 and @entity13			1
" it also potentially exposes the employer who seeks this access to unanticipated legal liability			0
" @entity25 said that @entity1 has seen a " distressing increase " in reports of job candidates being asked for their passwords over the past few months			1
she notes the practice violates not just the user 's privacy but also that of his or her @entity1 friends			1
it also might violate employment laws , according to the post			0
" ( @entity40 ) e do n't think it 's right the thing to do , " she said			0
" but it also may cause problems for the employers that they are not anticipating			0
for example , if an employer sees on @entity1 that someone is a member of a protected group ( e.g. over a certain age , etc. ) that employer may open themselves up to claims of discrimination if they do n't hire that person			0
" earlier this week , the @entity56 spoke out against the practice			1
the group said they 've gotten multiple reports of people either being asked for their passwords or required to " friend " managers when they were applying for jobs			0
@entity64 of the @entity66 area testified before the @entity67 in february that he was trying to reapply for his corrections officer job after taking a leave of absence when he was told he needed to hand over his password to prove he had no gang affiliations			2
" i did not want to do it , but because i really needed my job and he implied that this was a condition of recertification , i reluctantly gave him the password , " he told @entity73 lawmakers , who are considering outlawing the practice			2
in her post , @entity25 said that @entity1 will consider going to court if it hears of the practice continuing			2
" @entity1 takes your privacy seriously , " she wrote			2
" we 'll take action to protect the privacy and security of our users , whether by engaging policymakers or , where appropriate , by initiating legal action , including by shutting down applications that abuse their privileges			1
" it is already against @entity1 's terms of service to share a password			1
" you will not share your password , ( or in the case of developers , your secret key ) , let anyone else access your account , or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account , " the agreement reads .			0
