-- more people have walked on the moon than have won the fabled @entity3 of @entity5 horse racing			1
but the scores could soon be level			2
the last lunar landing was in 1972 , and it is 36 years since teenager @entity9 became just the 11th jockey to complete the triumvirate of @entity5 classics , on board @entity13			1
on saturday , @entity15 will attempt put his name in the record books at the @entity18 amid a " will he , wo n't he " debate that 's gripped the @entity5 in recent weeks			1
" there 's the time factor , so many big races in so little time , " the horse 's jockey @entity23 told @entity0			1
" very few horses go in all three races and there are a lot of good horses in the field on saturday that will be fresher			1
that 's why it 's so , so tough			2
" it might be a tough ask , but @entity15 is the evens favorite for victory in front of an expected crowd of 100,000 people over a mile and a half , seeking to add to his victories in the @entity44 and @entity45			1
the @entity3 races take place over the space of just five weeks in an era when thoroughbreds tend to run no more than once a month			1
after his @entity45 success , @entity15 became front page news after @entity55 racing officials decided to allow the three - year - old to wear a breathing strip at @entity58			1
his owners might not have allowed him to race without a strip , which the manufacturer says allows horses to breathe more freely and reduces the risk of bleeding in the lungs during heavy exertion			1
@entity15 has worn the strips during his last six wins			1
" we 've grown to train horses to run less frequently , " says dr. @entity68 , a leading equine vet in the @entity5 who will also cover the @entity18 as a television pundit			1
" it 's not so much these three races in five weeks but the series of races			0
you need a certain number of points to qualify for the @entity44 , so that means it 's a sequence of six or seven races for @entity15			1
" it 's like @entity84 athletes -- you ca n't peak all season , though it 's doable			1
" history supports @entity68 's argument			1
five horses have had the opportunity to complete the treble in the past 12 years , and all have come up short			1
@entity95 jockey @entity94 , who is unbeaten on board @entity15 , was one of those five			1
in 2002 , he was riding @entity97 only for his mount to stumble out of the stalls , virtually unseating @entity94 and effectively eradicating his race chances before the @entity18 -- known as " the test of a champion " -- had barely begun			2
" things have to be perfect or very nearly perfect for it to happen , " says @entity94 , who this week has pitched at the @entity103 , rang the bell at the @entity107 and appeared on the @entity108 as the interest @entity15 's feats has spiraled			1
" there are so many things against you			0
it 's a different distance to the previous two races -- a mile and a half -- but he 's run that , and it 's a different surface			2
" like in the @entity44 and the @entity45 , the surface is dirt but @entity58 is known as " the @entity119 " -- a nod to its sandier terrain , necessitated by the region 's combination of greater rainfall and higher humidity			0
but the distance and surface are not the only obstacles in the way of the trifecta wannabe			0
the dangers in the field lie with : @entity133 , winner of the @entity134 -- effectively the @entity58 trial ; @entity45 runner - up ride on @entity137 ; and @entity138 , apparently refreshed after his last race , finishing second in the @entity44			0
" i spoke to a vet that takes care of @entity15 and he said he could n't have a better personality for what he 's trying to do , " says @entity68			1
" he 's just like a kid at a carnival			0
physically he 's in great shape			0
if he does his best performance , i do n't think there 's a horse that can go with him in the race			2
" i feel good about it			0
i think he 'll do it			0
" @entity94 can vividly remember his first triple attempt in 2002 , the buildup -- " which was no way as crazy as this time " -- and the butterflies in his stomach as he entered the stalls			2
" for me , 2002 is still a tough one , " he says			2
" i never thought i 'd get a second chance and i 'm very lucky to get one			0
" he slipped and it was so sharp my reaction was just to avoid hitting the ground			0
right then , the chance was gone and the race was only just beginning			0
" but that 's the @entity3			1
over three races so many different things can happen			0
that was unlucky and you need luck			0
" the 11th of 12 children , @entity94 had an occasionally tumultuous upbringing , moving to the sprawling , often unsafe metropolis of @entity178 when he was eight			2
" we had fun as children but @entity178 was crazy and dangerous , " he recalls			0
" i know that every day somebody got shot , people that i know as well			0
" but nothing ever happened to my family			0
maybe we were just very lucky			0
" @entity15 has gripped @entity5 hearts , effectively bought and bred for $ 10,000 by two owner novices , trained by a septuagenarian and ridden by a jockey who thought his best days had gone			1
" @entity15 has a great chance -- he 's improved a lot with each race , " says @entity94			1
" @entity97 had to run from the front -- that was his way			0
but this one 's different -- he wins from everywhere			0
" at the @entity44 , @entity94 chose to slot him into third position , only moving into the lead on the final turn before pulling out a five - length victory			0
at the earlier @entity205 , he found himself boxed in by two horses but broke clear once again for the win			1
one factor against @entity94 in 2002 , and again this year , is his record at @entity58			2
he has won just two of his 69 races there			0
" that 's because most rides there are for me trying out other horses with the focus on one big race , " the 42 - year - old says			2
" i do n't care if i lose every race as long as i win this one			2

@entity15 is bidding to become the first horse in 36 years to win the @entity3
only 11 horses in history have done it and five have come up short in the last 12 years
@entity23 is on board @entity15 and *explains* how a previous 2002 bid failed
*achieving* the feat is likened to winning all four tennis grand slams in a solitary season
