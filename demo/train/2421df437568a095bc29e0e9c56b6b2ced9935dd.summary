-- a growing number of @entity2 are keeping their cash in their wallets this @entity7 as the traditional exchange of red packets of money is moving from the physical world into the digital space			1
the tradition of giving cash gifts of " lucky money " ( " hong bao " in @entity17 and " lai see " in @entity18 ) goes back centuries and can be particularly lucrative for the young and the unmarried			1
as the country increasingly embraces online transactions and e-commerce models , tradition is taking a back seat to convenience as more and more lucky money recipients prefer to receive their money via electronic means			1

the country is becoming increasingly connected -- over 90 % of 18 to 30 year olds in @entity2 own an internet - connected smartphone , according to a @entity40 survey published last year			0
of course , @entity2 's internet giants have not been slow to capitalize on this trend , with @entity44 - based @entity43 last week launching their ' @entity47 @entity46 ' app , an add - on to its phenomenally popular wechat messaging service			2
the company 's 600 million - plus @entity51 users can send each other lucky money through their profiles , provided both the sender and recipient have signed up to the company 's in - app payment service			1

while @entity43 's rival @entity74 also has a similar service , called @entity46 , which launched last year , @entity51 's app allows users to randomly distribute up to 200 yuan ( $ 33 ) within a group of friends , adding a fun element of unpredictability to the process			1
some analysts believe that linking the payments to @entity51 's in - app payment service could be a game - changer , as it streamlines the process of paying for microtransactions , potentially making users more likely to make in - app purchases in the future			0
