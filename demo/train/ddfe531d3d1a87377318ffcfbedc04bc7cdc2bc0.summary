almost two years since the @entity0 brothers allegedly placed two bombs at the @entity5 finish line , turning the city 's beloved @entity7 race into a war zone , @entity0 is finally going on trial			1
by the time the brothers were captured ( one dead , one alive ) , they were accused of having killed four people , blown the limbs off another 16 and injured more than 260			2
but while i have heard many say they wish the authorities had simply added the younger @entity0 brother to the list of the deceased while they had the chance , that did n't happen			1
so now we find ourselves facing down a trial			2
@entity0 will be convicted ( after all , the prosecution has , according to the @entity25 , lined up 590 law enforcement witnesses , 142 civilians and more than 1,000 exhibits , including images of him placing his backpack -- believed to have contained a bomb -- near an 8 - year - old killed by the explosion )			1
but it is unclear what the punishment will be			0
that raises what is perhaps the key question of the case : should we kill @entity0 ? and the answer , despite the abhorrent nature of the crime , is simple : no , we should not			1
we are better than that			0
the fact is that the death penalty is n't justice , it 's revenge			1
and in seeking it out , we would be engaging in something @entity0 is alleged to have sought in the name of @entity50 killed in @entity51 and @entity52			1
( he made his motive clear when he scrawled " stop killing our innocent people and we will stop " as he hid from police in a boat			0
) indeed , the death penalty is nothing more than institutionalized revenge			1
and while seeking revenge makes for great action movies , in real life it lowers our own standards			2
and we have set our standards very high in @entity66 , including having abolished the death penalty three decades ago			1
in fact , no one has been executed in @entity66 for 67 years			0
it goes without saying that this is a deeply painful time for family and friends who lost loved ones that day , but research does suggest that executions do not give victims ' families closure			0
getting revenge wo n't bring back the lives that were lost , and state - sanctioned killing is not how we do things here			1
and it is n't how we want things done , either			2
in a @entity86 poll in september 2013 , for example , only a third favored the death penalty over life without parole for @entity0			1
i 've been disappointed that our leading politicians -- @entity92 , the @entity93 senator from @entity66 , and our new mayor , @entity94 , both opponents of the death penalty -- have failed to speak out clearly against the federal government for seeking the death penalty in this case			1
indeed , even though attorney general @entity99 is personally against the death penalty , he authorized it in this case , and plea deals to avoid the death penalty have so far failed			1
i guess it 's easier to be outspoken against the death penalty when you 're not defending an alleged terrorist , but instead pointing out the alarming number of death row prisoners who have been wrongly convicted			1
or that according to some , it costs 10 times more to try to execute someone than put them in jail for life			2
or that it does n't actually appear to deter crime			2
or that the @entity117 prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and the @entity119 has already ruled against the death penalty in cases against the mentally ill or minors			1
and with that in mind , it 's important to remember in this case that the defense will not be eyeing an acquittal , rather a sentence that spares @entity0 's life			1
to make this case , the defense attorneys will no doubt delve deep into his personal history , the evidence that his older brother , @entity135 , was the mastermind , and that @entity0 was under his brother 's spell			1
perhaps most importantly , it should be remembered that in defending @entity0 , they are not endorsing him , but instead are endorsing our collective humanity and our @entity141 , fighting for even the worst among us to be afforded its consideration and its protection			1
my husband and i have lived in the @entity148 area for 18 years , we have run many marathons , and like so many folks , we had friends who were injured when those bombs when off			0
what struck us so profoundly about the attack , though , was not the destruction and devastation , but our response			0
our response was profound and full of courage			0
first responders went running toward the blast areas to help			0
runners , many of whom were doctors or veterans who had just finished running 26.2 miles , carried the injured to safety or ran to emergency rooms to help tend to the wounded			0
it 's that kind of resolve that defined the day , not the attack itself			2
@entity148 , an area of millions , became a community of one : a " @entity173 " community			0
and after the bombings , we took our kids to the makeshift memorial at @entity178 , we donated to the one fund , we cried as we watched the interfaith memorial service held just days after the blast			0
a year later , we joined millions of people along the race course and cheered on the 36,000 runners who ran one year after the bombing			0
running the race again was a way to reclaim both the day and the finish line			0
like marathoners , the survivors have pushed ahead one step at a time , and in their own ways : starting foundations , getting married , and learning to dance and run again			0
and this is what we should keep doing -- moving forward , leaving the attackers in the dust , forgotten in a cell somewhere to live with what has been done			0
revenge is by its very nature a backward - looking emotion			2
if we are to truly leave that atrocious act behind us , we should therefore shun it , and instead keep putting our best foot forward , looking to our future , not behind us			0
if we do that , we will be the stronger ones -- @entity173 .			0
