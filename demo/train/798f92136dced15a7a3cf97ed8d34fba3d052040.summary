@entity3 won both the @entity23 and @entity24 titles last year , but also made headlines for an interview with @entity28 magazine in june where she made some unflattering remarks about an unnamed player widely assumed to be @entity4 , calling her " boring " and criticizing her choice of boyfriend ( @entity33 )			1
@entity4 responded saying @entity3 should concentrate on tennis rather than taking sideswipes at the personal lives of her opponents			1
@entity3 has won 14 of her 16 encounters against @entity4 and has n't lost to the @entity39 in almost a decade			1
on thursday , @entity3 recalled the moment the tide turned at the semifinals of the @entity43 in 2005 -- a match she won 8 - 6 in the third set after saving three match points			1
" i remember a forehand inside out , " @entity3 said			2
" i was down match point and i hit this winner and i did n't even blink			0

" @entity4 said her memory of the point was a little more sketchy and stressed the importance of looking forward			2
" 2005 ? oh , my @entity57 , i ca n't go back that far , " @entity4 said			2

i have a lot of things going on in my life , " @entity4 said			2
" some of the matches were a bit closer than others			0
when you go out on the court in a new time , you ca n't really rely on everything that happened in the past			0
you 've got to start from scratch from the first point			0
" of course i know i 've tried and i did n't succeed in the last many times that i 've played her , but i 'm setting up an opportunity to go out there and try to change that , and i 'm going to try to do that			0
