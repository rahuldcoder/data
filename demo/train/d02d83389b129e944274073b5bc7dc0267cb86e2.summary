-- does anyone want to win @entity2 ? all three sides challenging for the @entity5 title failed to win on the season 's penultimate weekend ensuring the title race will go to the final day			1
@entity9 drew 1 - 1 at home to ten - man @entity11 , @entity8 were held to a scoreless draw away to @entity14 while @entity15 fell to a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity17			1
the results mean only @entity8 or @entity9 can now win the title			1
both sides will face each other in the season 's final round of fixtures at the @entity25 next weekend in what is sure to be a dramatic and emotional occasion			0
@entity9 will be particularly disappointed with their failure to win sunday as three points against 13th placed @entity11 would have seen them crowned champions in front of a passionate @entity33 crowd			1
the @entity34 , who were without top scorer @entity35 due to injury , missed numerous chances in the first period and fell behind in the 66th minute after mistakes by defender @entity40 and goalkeeper @entity41			0
@entity40 allowed an aimless long - ball bounce over him enabling @entity11 striker @entity43 to nick the ball off @entity41 who had come needlessly charging from his goal in an attempt to make up for his teammates initial error			2
@entity43 then composed himself before bundling the ball into the empty @entity9 net			2
@entity52 teams may have crumbled under the pressure of such a misstep but @entity9 and @entity40 were undimmed by their carelessness and hit back shortly after			2
the @entity57 defender rose to head a @entity59 corner beyond @entity11 goalkeeper @entity60 to level the scores at 1 - 1 after 74 minutes			2
aware @entity8 were being held and @entity15 losing , @entity9 went for the kill			1
@entity64 saved well from @entity65 twice before @entity11 were reduced to ten men after defender @entity67 was harshly shown a second yellow card for bringing down @entity69 at the edge of the away side 's penalty box			2
@entity73 hit the side netting from the resultant free - kick as injury time approached -- but @entity9 would have one final chance to win it			1
@entity78 tip - toed his way into the @entity11 box before striking a curling shot that looked to be heading towards the top corner only for another heroic @entity64 save to deny the @entity84 sub			2
speaking after the match , @entity9 manager @entity85 maintained he was proud of his team despite the result , telling reporters that " the players gave their maximum			0
" the @entity92 also revealed he hopes star striker @entity35 will be fit for next weekend 's showdown where " nobody believes we can win in @entity8			1
" while that last comment may be an early attempt at mind games , @entity9 's draw means @entity8 's failure to win at @entity14 is not as catastrophic as it could have been			1
the @entity101 's will still have to beat @entity84 on the final day to secure the championship , however , something they have failed to do in five attempts this season			0
@entity106 came closest for a laboring @entity8 against an @entity14 side who are struggling to avoid relegation			1
the @entity5 international midfielder smacked the crossbar with a ferocious first - half volley while @entity114 and @entity115 also both missed good opportunities to secure victory			0
" what a league final awaits us on saturday , " tweeted @entity106 after learning of @entity9 's failure to win			1
" with our people we can get it			0
" defender @entity123 also took to twitter to add : " there is no glory without suffering , no glory without a fight			0
" while @entity8 and @entity9 have one final chance to claim glory next weekend , the same can not now be said for @entity15			1
two major defensive errors handed @entity132 's @entity17 an impressive 2 - 0 victory in @entity5 's @entity134			0
a dithering @entity135 was dispossessed by @entity17 striker @entity136 who went on to round @entity137 and fire the ball into the @entity9 two minutes before half - time			1
@entity141 's careless backpass in the 63rd minute then enabled @entity136 to double the home side 's advantage			0
the striker again rounded @entity78 after intercepting @entity141 's misplaced pace and slotted into an empty net			0
after the match , dejected @entity15 midfielder , @entity148 , told the club 's website that @entity15 had " let the league slip because of our own mistakes			0
" " now we just have to learn from it and put our minds on the last league match as a preparation for the final of the @entity158			0
