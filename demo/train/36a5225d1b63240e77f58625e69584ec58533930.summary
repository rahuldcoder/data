-- the father of @entity2 , the man accused of shooting and killing an unarmed black teen , says the teen threatened to kill @entity2 and then beat him so badly that it forced @entity2 to shoot him			1
" @entity9 said something to the effect of , ' you 're going to die now ' or ' you 're going to die tonight , ' something to that effect , " @entity6 told @entity8 tv station @entity7			1
" he continued to beat @entity2			1
at some point , @entity2 pulled his pistol			1
" in the interview @entity6 , his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety , vehemently defended the shooting , which has caused outrage throughout the nation , moved president @entity24 to call it a tragedy , and prompted a federal investigation			2
@entity6 told the news station that @entity9 confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually			1
" he was punched in the nose			2
his nose was broken , " @entity6 said			2
" he was knocked to the concrete			2
@entity9 got on top of him and just started beating him			2
in his nose , hitting his head on the concrete			2
" @entity6 was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation			2
the elder @entity2 's account was disputed by @entity9 's family attorney and several other legal experts			1
a surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows @entity2 , his hands cuffed , exiting a patrol car			1
the video , first broadcast wednesday by @entity53 , shows an officer looking at the back of @entity2 's head			1
the video does not provide a close - up of @entity2 's head , but some say it shows @entity2 did not have significant injuries to his face			1
" the injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all , " said @entity61 , the former prosecutor in the @entity63 trial			2
he moves fluidly , not like someone who has just been through a beating in any way , shape or form , someone whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described , someone whose nose was broken and bleeding			2
that tells you a great deal			1
" @entity80 , @entity9 's mother , said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly			1
" i believe that this video is the icing on the cake , " she said			2
" this is not the first part of the evidence that they have had			2
they have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses			0
this is in addition to what the @entity96 has always had			0
there is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested			0
" the 17 - year - old was shot to death february 26 by @entity2 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , as @entity9 was walking back to his father 's fiancee 's house in @entity107 , @entity108			1
he was wearing a hoodie and carrying @entity111 candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store			0
evolution of the hoodie @entity2 says he killed @entity9 in self defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community			1
@entity2 has not been arrested , and authorities have said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of what happened			1
the shooting has hit a nerve in the nation , sparked a debate about racial profiling , and ignited protests and calls for @entity2 's arrest			1
@entity133 apologizes for retweet error @entity6 said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism			0
" i never foresaw so much hate coming from the president , the @entity139 , the @entity140			0
every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way , " @entity6 told @entity7			0
" but there 's so much hate that i have never been involved in hate and @entity2 has n't			1
" @entity6 said his son is not racist and race had nothing to do with the incident			0
" he would do anything to help anybody at any time			0
he 's colorblind when it comes to any race , " @entity6 said			0
@entity158 , @entity9 's father , said wednesday that the 911 tape shows @entity2 was profiling his son			1
in a recording of @entity2 's call to police , some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur			1
@entity0 enhanced the sound of the 911 call , and several members of @entity0 's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether @entity2 used a slur			1
@entity173 , the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case , said tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that @entity2 used a racial slur			1
@entity9 , who lived in @entity179 , was visiting @entity107 after receiving a 10 - day suspension from school , a family spokesman has said			0
an empty plastic bag found in his book bag had been determined to contain marijuana residue			0
@entity185 , @entity9 's parents ' attorney , said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth			0
@entity108 law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury			0
it has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in @entity108			0
but as more and more information surfaces , the picture of what happened becomes more complicated			0
what the witnesses are saying despite the twists and turns in the case , @entity205 , @entity9 's mother , says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son 's case			0
" i feel confident that they 're going to do a thorough investigation , " @entity205 said			0
" we 're trying to be patient , even though it 's been over a month			0
we 're trying to be patient , and we 're trying to press on for justice			0
" @entity0 's @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 and @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
