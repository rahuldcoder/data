-- @entity2 's 16 - year stay in the @entity3 has come to an end as a @entity6 own goal saw them lose 1 - 0 at @entity8			1
@entity2 players react after @entity6 's own goal sees them relegated from the @entity3			1
@entity6 deflected a 38th - minute shot from @entity12 past his own keeper @entity13 to seal @entity2 's fate			2
@entity2 's misery was complete when defender @entity16 was sent off for a late challenge on @entity19 winger @entity18			0
the result meant @entity22 legend @entity21 failed to work the miracle he was brought in to try and achieve with eight games remaining			0
@entity2 will be joined in the @entity25 by @entity26 , who were beaten 2 - 1 at @entity28 and @entity29 , whose relegation was already confirmed prior to sunday 's final matches			1
both @entity33 and @entity34 survived the drop , despite both also losing their final matches			1
@entity33 were beaten 1 - 0 at home by a second - string @entity39 side , while @entity34 lost 3 - 2 at home to @entity41 in @entity43 's final game in charge of the @entity46 side			1
despite escaping relegation , @entity34 manager @entity47 -- who had only been in charge for five months after @entity50 's relegation -- announced his decision to resign at the end of their match			1
meanwhile , @entity2 have paid the price for a season of instability ever since @entity59 decided to quit as manager in early september and owner @entity61 decided to put the club up for sale			0
@entity64 was brought in to try and rescue the situation until his heart problems terminated his involvement and led to former @entity19 and @entity2 striker @entity21 getting the call			0
but it was always going to be an uphill task to reverse a season of under - achievement and turmoil in such a short space of time			0
now @entity21 has to decide whether he wants to take on the task of trying to help the @entity22 regain their top flight status and is due to have talks with @entity61 early next week			1
" it 's painful and it hurts			0
it 's been a great experience for me and in a weird way i have enjoyed it , " @entity21 told @entity81			0
" but lets get something straight , we did n't go down because of today , but because we were n't good enough after 38 games			0
" @entity89 changes need to be made at this club , players need to go and others have to arrive because , collectively , we were not good enough to survive			0
" @entity2 's result ensured @entity33 stayed in the @entity3 , despite their defeat against champions @entity39			1
as expected , @entity39 manager @entity95 put out a reserve side with one eye on wednesday 's @entity99 final against @entity100 , but they still proved too strong for the home side and @entity104 's superb first half long - range strike proved enough for the visitors			2
second - bottom @entity26 will join the @entity22 and already - relegated @entity29 in the @entity25 after their defeat at @entity108			1
the hosts went ahead after 33 minutes when @entity110 sidefooted past goalkeeper @entity111 and although @entity112 hit an equalizer shortly after the break , the @entity28 won the match eight minutes later through @entity116			2
@entity34 were the only other side in danger of getting relegated at the start of play and had other results to thank for their survival after they were beaten by @entity41			2
@entity124 claimed the season 's @entity126 award in style with a wonder - strike , his 19th of the season , two minutes into the second half			2
@entity132 took advantage of @entity135 's fumble to level but @entity137 gave the visitors the lead again in the 74th minute and @entity140 wrapped up the win in the final 10 minutes			0
@entity142 scored a late consolation goal for @entity34 , who will now be looking for a new manager following @entity47 's announcement , although the @entity147 will remain on the coaching staff			1
@entity149 finish the table in fifth place after a 2 - 0 victory at @entity153 , who have qualified for the @entity155 in seventh place despite the defeat			1
@entity158 hit both goals for the @entity149 , but @entity161 's team retained seventh as @entity163 were beaten 3 - 1 by @entity164			1
the hosts took the lead in the first - half thanks to @entity168 ' header and @entity170 's own goal made it two after the break			2
@entity173 pulled one back against his former club with a quarter of an hour to go , but @entity175 netted @entity164 's third nine minutes from time			0
elsewhere , @entity176 were in a rampant mood at the @entity178 , demolishing @entity179 in the first half on the way to a 4 - 1 victory			2
the @entity183 opened the scoring on 10 minutes when striker @entity185 slotted the ball into his own net from @entity189 ' cross			0
the hosts then made it 2 - 0 on the quarter hour when @entity191 was brought down by @entity192 and then converted the resulting spot - kick			1
@entity195 @entity194 headed home a a third goal two minutes later before @entity179 pulled one back through a @entity199 penalty			0
