-- a worker was paid for 12 years without ever showing up for work at a @entity5 , @entity6 , agency funded by federal , state and local money , officials say			1
@entity5 mayor @entity9 told @entity0 on friday that when a new director took over at @entity13 recently , she was " doing her due diligence " when she discovered the hooky - playing employee was on the books			1
the director , @entity16 , then notified the city attorney 's office , @entity9 said			2
@entity19 , a spokeswoman for the @entity13 , told @entity0 friday that her agency could n't comment because of the ongoing investigation			1
on behalf of the city attorney 's office , @entity5 city spokeswoman @entity22 referred to a statement released on wednesday that said , " the city attorney 's office , with the approval of @entity16 , took appropriate steps to prevent any further payments to the employee and the employee was terminated			1
" it added , " the city attorney has undertaken a detailed investigation of the circumstances and history of this matter to determine what further personnel actions should be taken , and the board of the @entity13 passed unanimous motions supporting the executive director in any further employment actions she might take on the advice of counsel			1
after all necessary employment actions are taken , the city attorney will turn the matter over to @entity5 's @entity49 for further investigation			1
" @entity0 affiliate @entity51 said that the employee , a woman whose name was not released , " earned " somewhere between $ 300,000 and $ 480,000 , not including full benefits , from the board over the past dozen years			1
the @entity5 board is partially funded by the @entity57 of @entity58 and @entity59			1
according to the department 's website , it is one of 40 locally run community services boards that " serve children and adults who have -- or who are at risk of -- mental illness , serious emotional disturbance , intellectual disabilities , or substance use disorders			1
" the mayor said state law requires cities , towns and counties throughout @entity6 to host the boards , but each city has little involvement beyond providing some of the funding for the offices			1
" this is not a city employee			0
she does not work for the city , does not get a city check , " @entity9 said			0
he added that while the @entity88 appoints members to the @entity13 , the board hires its own director and is autonomous and independent			1
the city of @entity5 provides just under $ 4 million of the local board 's budget a year , @entity9 said			1
@entity94 , a spokeswoman for the @entity95 and @entity59 , said the state pays $ 9.7 million annually and the federal government usually contributes $ 2.4 million , but this year added $ 190,000 in stimulus funds			1
@entity9 expressed concerns about a lack of oversight at the agency			2
the @entity103 is a " quasi-federal , state and local agency that operates independently , " he said			1
" no one really judges their performance , if you will			0
it 's not a good model			0
" @entity94 said there is some state oversight			2
each board is required to commission an independent annual audit , then send a copy of that audit to the state			2
a state auditor then looks for red flags and prioritizes the reports by risk level , she said			0
" recent audits of @entity5 showed low risk and no need for our department to conduct our own audit , " @entity94 said			1
" we do n't have an employee - employer relationship with them , but if we do find out about a situation or something that needs to be investigated ... we can investigate through our internal audit process			1
" @entity5 councilman @entity133 commented on the situation friday , saying , " we could have and should have done more in this case , but i think when you get an audited financial statement at the end of the year and a clean opinion , it gives you some level of comfort			2
" he added that government at all levels , including his , needs to be held accountable			0
" i 'm sure the mayor and city manager will get to the bottom of it , [ but ] the buck stops with the city council , " @entity133 said			0
" if it has the word ' @entity5 ' in it , it stops with us			2
that 's part of the job			0
" @entity94 said that while the state does not have authority over personnel issues , it does have authority over policy and procedure , and when the state makes recommendations for change in those areas , " if they do n't make changes , we can take some action			2
in the worst case , we can withhold some state funds			0
" but that withholding of cash seems unlikely in this case			0
@entity94 said that " it appears @entity13 is working diligently to resolve this issue			2
" @entity177 was the @entity5 board 's executive director for 12 years , with a short gap between his and @entity16 's tenure			1
even though his time in charge overlapped with the alleged shirker for about a decade , @entity177 told @entity0 on friday , " i know nothing about it			0
i read it in the paper			0
" @entity177 added that no one had called him to ask about the situation and that " whatever the investigation is , they have not informed me of any details			0
" when @entity94 was asked how a person who got paid for not working could have escaped detection for so long , she said she was unsure			0
" we do n't know at this point how something like this can happen			0
we 're very concerned , " she said			0
" [ we 're ] working on procedure to prevent this from happening again			0
" @entity5 's newest city councilman , @entity199 , told @entity0 friday that " people want accountability			2
" @entity199 said that when he recently met with a city auditor , he was told about a shelved proposal that predated him , calling for a hotline that @entity5 city workers -- and workers at @entity5 - affiliated agencies such as @entity13 -- could call confidentially to report fraud or any other ethical issues			1
he said the city council has now " technically endorsed " the idea and is working on an ordinance to implement the plan , with the hope that such a fix " probably would have caught something like this			0

a woman who worked at a government - funded agency did n't show up for 12 years
she was paid at least $ 300,000 over that time span , @entity5 *tv* station @entity51 says
the @entity13 is a mental *health* agency with 40 @entity6 locations
recent audits of the @entity5 office had shown no problems , says a linked state agency
