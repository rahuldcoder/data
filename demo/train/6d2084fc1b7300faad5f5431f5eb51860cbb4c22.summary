-- @entity1 is stepping on the gas , cutting interest rates to record lows , trying to funnel money into the real economy , and introducing a charge on banks that hold excess reserves with the @entity10			1
he is right to worry			2
@entity12 inflation is running at less than 1 % a year , with several countries already experiencing falling prices			2
deflation , and even very low inflation , can be a huge drag on economic activity			1
there 's no encouragement to spend today to avoid higher prices tomorrow -- indeed , falling prices make putting off purchases attractive			2
flat or falling prices also make it harder for businesses and consumers to pay off the debts left over from the financial crisis , increasing their reluctance to invest and spend			0
in the grip of these forces , @entity32 suffered two decades of stagnation			0
the eurozone 's recovery is already stalling , and a deflationary downward spiral would be a disaster			1
unfortunately , @entity1 is likely to discover the @entity10 's gas pedal is already on the floor			1
there 's no way to push money into the economy unless businesses and consumers are ready to borrow it to invest and spend			1
today 's measures are designed to encourage banks to look harder for borrowers			1
they aim to do this by lowering banks ' costs of borrowing , by imposing some small costs on banks that sit on money rather than lending it out , and by making it cheaper for banks to borrow from the @entity10 to fund lending to small businesses			1
but the banks would n't be sitting on money in the first place if they had credit - worthy business clients eager to take out loans			0
indeed , rather than clamoring for new loans from the @entity10 , the banks have been paying down existing ones			1
what is needed are policies addressed not to lenders , but to potential borrowers and spenders , who are holding back because of the dismal prospects for growth			1
a significant chunk of responsibility lies on the shoulders of @entity1 and other @entity10 leaders for the eurozone 's utter failure to construct a plausible model for growth since the crisis			1
after a brief period of fiscal stimulus in 2009 , the eurozone has pursued an austerity agenda that compounds the weakness of private demand by shrinking public demand			1
@entity1 and his predecessor @entity94 did all they could to ensure monetary easing was accompanied by fiscal tightening , in effect refusing to hit the gas pedal unless governments were standing on the brakes			0
this seemingly bizarre policy does have a rationale			0
the idea is to force the countries of the eurozone periphery become more competitive through cutting costs and especially wages , enabling growth through exports rather than domestic demand			1
to some extent , the policy has worked : savage levels of unemployment and @entity10 - backed measures to reduce labor bargaining power have lowered costs in the periphery			1
by the end of 2013 , exports accounted for over 27 % of eurozone gdp , up from 23 % on the eve of the financial crisis			2
further , the eurozone trade surplus exceeded 3 % of gdp			2
these figures are the highest since the introduction of the euro			0
despite these unprecedented developments , eurozone growth remains exceedingly weak			2
that demonstrates the deep intellectual failure behind the austerity - competitiveness agenda			0
the rickety export - led growth model faces another important threat : the euro 's dramatic appreciation			0
@entity1 's famous july 2012 pledge to do " whatever it takes " to preserve the euro stopped the flight from sovereign bonds and other euro - denominated financial assets			0
trade surpluses also tend to promote currency appreciation			0
the stronger euro raises the prices of the currency bloc 's businesses versus their competitors , reversing a substantial portion of the painfully won competitiveness gain			0
this accounts for the efforts of @entity1 and others to talk the euro down , but the effect has not offset the appreciation			0
while @entity1 clearly hopes that today 's measures will further weaken the euro , they are unlikely to have much effect			0
for all their exceptional character , today 's @entity10 measures are , at best , efforts to shore up a fundamentally misguided growth model that is doomed to collapse			1
a serious policy to fight deflation requires putting both feet on the gas , with monetary stimulus and fiscal stimulus working together , a model that has had some success in @entity32			0
it requires abandoning the mirage of export - led growth as a savior for the eurozone , and vigorous efforts to stoke demand by increasing government spending and promoting wage growth			2
only this will lead to a virtuous circle of borrowing , lending , and growth , and a sustainable rate of price growth			0
but @entity1 's statement today revealed how very far he is from recognizing this point			0
he once again reiterated his support for austerity - led policies whose only coherent rationale is to promote falling ( or at best stagnant ) prices in the eurozone 's periphery : in other words , precisely the deflation he claims to wish to avoid			1
until this fundamental contradiction is resolved , the eurozone is going nowhere			2

the @entity10 cut interest rates to a new record low in a bid to boost the economy
but economist @entity218 says the *approach* will not work for the eurozone
what is needed are policies addressed to borrowers and spenders , he writes

@entity12:Eurozone
@entity10:ECB
