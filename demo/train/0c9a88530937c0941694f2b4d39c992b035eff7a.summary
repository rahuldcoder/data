@entity0 -- president @entity2 announced thursday that he has picked @entity3 , a @entity4 administration commerce secretary , to serve as his new chief of staff			1
the move , part of a major @entity9 reshuffling , was warmly received by some traditional opponents of the president			1
it set off alarm bells among some more liberal groups that the president is shifting to the political center in anticipation of the 2012 campaign			0
@entity3 is the son of legendary @entity20 mayor @entity19 and brother of the city 's current mayor , @entity22			1
he runs @entity25 operations for the investment bank @entity26 , and his appointment is expected to help patch up @entity2 's frosty relations with the business community after nasty battles over health care reform , taxes and government regulations			1
" few @entity34 can boast the breadth of experience that @entity37 brings to this job , " @entity2 said at the @entity9			1
he " possesses a deep understanding of how jobs are created " and has a " smidgen of awareness of how government works			0
" the president said @entity3 would bring " strong values " and " forward - looking vision " to the administration			1
the appointment drew praise from one of the top republicans on @entity52			1
" i frankly think it 's kind of a hopeful sign , " said @entity54 minority leader @entity53 , @entity55			0
" this is a guy who 's actually been out in the private sector , been a part of business			0
... my first reaction is , it sounds like a good idea			0
" the pick also received a positive response from the @entity34 @entity67 , which lobbied heavily against expanding health care coverage and tightening regulations on @entity70 and spent millions on behalf of @entity72 candidates in the 2010 midterm elections			0
" @entity78 is a man of stature and extraordinary experience in government , business , trade negotiations , and global affairs , " @entity74 , the group 's ceo , said in a statement hailing the appointment			0
" he 's an accomplished manager and strong leader			0
we look forward to working with him to accelerate our recovery , grow the economy , create jobs , and tackle @entity34 's global challenges			0
" the reaction from the president 's base with organized labor , however , was noticeably cooler			0
" the president is of course entitled to choose a chief of staff in whom he has complete confidence , " @entity97 president @entity96 said in a statement			2
" yet president @entity2 and his administration will ultimately be judged by results -- whether the economy recovers robustly and begins to generate good jobs on the scale needed to improve the lives of working people			1
" @entity96 warned that @entity2 " needs a chief of staff who will reach out to diverse constituencies and make sure that the voices of ordinary americans are heard in the @entity9			1
" @entity3 will replace @entity116 , a former @entity117 congressman who has returned to @entity20 to run for mayor			2
@entity2 's interim chief of staff , @entity119 , will stay on as a counselor to the president for two years			1
" i would not be where i am today without ( @entity119 's ) extraordinary counsel , " @entity2 said			2
" i can not imagine life here without him			0
" the appointment of @entity3 is the latest in a series of high - level personnel moves by the @entity9 that have been announced in recent days			1
former @entity133 chairman @entity132 is stepping down as chairman of @entity2 's outside economic advisory panel , @entity130 sources familiar with the move said thursday			1
@entity132 had been a strong advocate for much tougher regulations for @entity70 in the wake of the financial crisis , although his position as chairman of the president 's @entity141 gave him little clout to actually enact policy			0
and senior officials say @entity2 is expected to name another @entity4 administration veteran , @entity146 , as chairman of the @entity148			1
@entity146 is currently a top adviser to treasury secretary @entity149 and won high marks inside the administration for negotiating last month 's tax deal with congressional @entity72			2
he would replace fellow @entity4 alumnus @entity153			2
in addition , senior adviser @entity154 is planning to leave the @entity9 in early 2011 to help run @entity2 's re-election campaign , while @entity9 spokesman @entity157 announced wednesday that he would soon leave the administration in what @entity157 himself called a " major retooling " of a @entity9 now dealing with a closely divided @entity162			1
when then - president @entity4 lost control of both chambers of @entity162 to republicans in 1994 , he tacked to the center and was able to score major legislative victories and easily win re-election in 1996			2
many democrats are rejoicing at @entity3 's selection now			2
" perfect for the job , " said @entity170 , a lobbyist who served as chief of staff to then - @entity173 @entity172 in the @entity4 and @entity174 years			1
" he has an impressive combination of stature and substance and political smarts			0
" but some liberals beyond organized labor are suspicious of @entity3 's close ties to the business community and are concerned that his appointment signals a sharp shift to the center			1
" this was a real mistake by the @entity9 , " said @entity187 , co-founder of the @entity188			2
" @entity78 consistently urges the @entity130 to pursue a corporate agenda that alienates both @entity192 and @entity130 voters			0
if president @entity2 listens to that kind of political advice from @entity78 , @entity130 will suffer a disastrous 2012			2
" @entity3 currently sits on the board of the @entity0 think tank @entity198 , a position he took in july			2
in a statement announcing the move , @entity3 said voters were n't returning to conservative ideology , but that " the left 's agenda has not won the support of a majority of @entity34			1
" it was a theme he also articulated in a 2009 piece in the @entity210 , arguing that @entity130 needed to steer " a more moderate course on the key issues of the day			0
" not surprisingly , the appointment drew praise from @entity3 's brother , who told reporters he was " very honored " that his sibling would be joining the @entity9			1
" i believe he brings a passion , a commitment of service , both in the public and private sector , " @entity22 said			0
" he brings a commitment of service to both the president personally and to the @entity34			0
" asked whether the appointment would mean more federal money for @entity20 , the mayor said , " i 'm praying			0
" @entity1 's @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
