@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands of people are taking part saturday in a march through the @entity1 city of @entity0 that many fear could inflame tensions between @entity9 and @entity10			1
over the course of the day , up to 30,000 people were expected to join the @entity14 parade , held to mark the 100th anniversary of the signing of a pro-union document which helped shape @entity1 's history			1
the parade left from @entity20 saturday morning , headed for the grounds of @entity22 , beside the @entity22			0
concerns over potential disorder along the route center have focused on an area near @entity27 , where violence flared up between @entity9 and @entity10 earlier this month			1
the parade passed near the flashpoint @entity9 , near the city center , without incident saturday morning but must still return along that route in the evening			1
hundreds of police officers are stationed along the route in that area , with many more elsewhere in the city , as the @entity1 police service braces for possible trouble			2
about 2,000 people took part in the morning parade feeding into the main demonstration , in which tens of thousands are expected to take part			1
the parade , a special event for the @entity14 centenary , is expected to be one of the biggest held in years			1
hundreds of parades take place across @entity1 each year , the majority involving the @entity51 and associated organizations , although pro-irish nationalists also have marches			0
the @entity56 rules on which marches are allowed to take place and which are banned , in an effort to keep friction to a minimum			0
most parades pass off peacefully , but when members of one community march near or through neighborhoods dominated by another , violence sometimes occurs			0
the rioting in @entity0 earlier this month , which left dozens of police officers injured , was some of the worst seen by the city in years			1
tensions have been high all summer , and behind - the - scenes talks over saturday 's highly symbolic parade did not succeed in brokering a compromise between the @entity9 and @entity51 communities over the staging of the event			1
the @entity14 was a document signed in 1912 by nearly half a million people in opposition to steps by the government in @entity83 to introduce " @entity84 , " or self - government , in @entity1 within the @entity86 and @entity1			2
the majority of the island gained independence in 1921 , following two years of conflict			0
but six of the nine counties of the province of @entity94 chose to stay in the @entity86 , eventually becoming the country of @entity1			0
in the late 1960s , the conflict between mainly @entity51 unionists , who want @entity1 to remain part of the @entity86 , and largely @entity9 nationalists , who want it to be reunited with the rest of @entity1 , exploded into a political and sectarian war , known as the @entity103			2
the three decades of ensuing violence between the @entity105 and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people , most of them north of the border			0
while the @entity112 of 1998 effectively ended the conflict , suspicions between @entity9 and @entity10 remain			2
