@entity0 -- a group that 's working to keep @entity3 in control of the @entity5 is releasing its first television ad in the contested @entity5 race in @entity8 between incumbent sen. @entity9 and his @entity11 challenger , @entity10			1
the " multi-million dollar " ad buy from the @entity14 comes as @entity9 's campaign faces a slew of negative headlines for releasing a political attack ad that focused on a gruesome 2013 murder and sexual assault case			1
the @entity14 said it was already planning to go up with the new 30 - second spot before the recent controversy , and the ad does n't mention @entity9 's ad			1
rather , it hits @entity10 for opposing @entity25			0
in the commercial , an elderly woman whose husband has alzheimer 's disease says @entity10 " supports a plan " to slash @entity32 benefits , and his policies would raise prescription drug costs			0
in the commercial , an elderly woman whose husband has alzheimer 's disease says @entity10 " supports a plan " to slash @entity32 benefits , and his policies would raise prescription drug costs			0
fact check : would repeal of @entity25 hike seniors ' drug costs ? according to the @entity44 , @entity8 has the largest growth rate for seniors ( age 65 and older ) ; the population for that age group increased by 54 % between 2000 and 2010			2
the ad also hits @entity10 for saying he 's open to raising the minimum age for @entity53 eligibility			2
while @entity10 has advocated for reform for younger generations , he has said " we 're not going to touch " benefits for seniors who are either receiving @entity53 benefits or about to receive them			0
" but with the younger generation , to phase in reform , there is opportunity , " he said last month at the @entity59 @entity11 debate			2
@entity1 rates the race between @entity10 and @entity9 as one of six toss - up contests in this year 's midterm elections			1
as a @entity14 senator in a reliably red state , @entity9 is considered one of the most vulnerable @entity3 up for re-election			1
@entity11 need a net gain of six seats to retake the majority in the @entity5			1
the @entity14 also has spent money on ads in @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
the new spot comes as @entity9 is under hot water after his campaign went up with a @entity87 - style ad against @entity10 on friday			2
the spot accused @entity10 of being soft on crime , focusing on a case in which a man allegedly murdered an elderly couple last year and sexually assaulted the couple 's granddaughter , as well as another elderly woman in the home			0
at the time of the crime , the suspect had just finished a prison sentence of four years for another crime			0
his sentence should have been longer because his record included a separate felony , but he was only sentenced to four years because of a mistake by the state			0
because @entity10 was serving as attorney general at the time of the suspect 's sentencing in 2010 , @entity9 's campaign tried to fault @entity10 for letting the suspect go early			2
however , the mistake that led to the short sentence was made before @entity10 became attorney general			0
@entity114 gave the ad a " pants on fire " rating , saying the ad " is not only inaccurate , it makes an inflammatory accusation			0
" shortly after the spot aired , the victims ' family called on @entity9 and @entity10 , who had released his own ad countering the claims , to pull down their spots , saying the publicity could affect the jury pool for the trial scheduled for this month			1
@entity10 's campaign asked tv stations to stop running the ad sunday , while @entity9 's team first said it would alter the ad to remove references to the case			1
the campaign later pulled down the ad altogether .			0

the @entity14 is *spending* money against the @entity11 challenger in @entity8 's @entity5 race
the @entity14 incumbent senator is facing *criticism* for making an ad that focused on a *heinous* murder
sen. @entity9 pulled down the ad after the victims ' family got involved
the race in @entity8 is close and could determine the *balance* of power in the @entity5
