@entity0 -- the closer @entity3 gets to voting on whether to back president @entity5 's call for a military attack on @entity7 , the more election politics influences the debate			1
splits exist on both the left and right , revealing the political calculations of @entity0 regarding next year 's congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote			1
while the 2014 contests faced by every @entity19 member and a third of the @entity21 are more proximate , the machinations at work in debating and acting on the @entity7 issue also are heavily focused on the balloting three years from now to choose @entity5 's successor			1
an expected @entity25 presidential contender , @entity26 sen. @entity24 , on wednesday demonstrated the art of present and future political messaging in his statement explaining why he voted against a resolution authorizing limited military strikes in response to what he agreed was @entity7 's use of banned chemical weapons			1
@entity24 blamed the @entity5 administration for mishandling @entity39 reaction to @entity7 's civil war , with help from @entity25 isolationists , by failing to strongly back opposition rebels when the conflict erupted in 2011			2
while he called then for " a more robust engagement " to help the @entity7 people topple @entity7 leader @entity47 , @entity24 said , he never advocated the use of @entity39 military might in the conflict			1
" had we forcefully engaged in empowering moderate rebels , today we would have more and better options before us , " he said			0
" but instead , unfortunately , the president , with the support of some voices in my own party , chose to let others lead instead			0
and now we are dealing with the consequences of that inaction			0
" that stance protected his conservative credentials by asserting military expertise , and also implicitly criticized two potential rivals for the @entity19 in 2016 -- former secretary of state @entity67 and @entity25 sen. @entity68 of @entity69			1
as @entity5 's top diplomat , @entity70 is automatically associated with the administration 's response to the @entity7 crisis until she stepped down early this year and was succeeded by @entity75 , a veteran @entity76 senator			2
@entity77 proving tough sell for @entity5 on @entity7 @entity70 , who had pushed for arming the @entity7 rebels but was overruled by @entity5 , is considered the frontrunner for the @entity76 presidential nomination if she decides to run , which is widely expected			2
her only statement so far on the current @entity7 question , issued by an aide , backed @entity5 's decision to seek congressional support for a military response			1
meanwhile , the libertarian @entity68 follows the same non-intervention policies espoused by his father , former @entity25 rep. @entity90 of @entity91 , who mounted several unsuccessful runs for president			0
like @entity24 , @entity68 also voted against the @entity7 authorization measure at wednesday 's meeting of the @entity97 , which passed it by a 10 - 7 margin			2
to distinguish himself from @entity68 , @entity100 used his statement to directly attack what he called isolationist policies , saying : " just because we ignore global problems does n't mean they will ignore us			0
" " instead , they become bigger and harder to solve , and sadly , @entity7 is just the latest example of that fundamental truth , " @entity24 said			2
another leading conservative voice , former @entity39 sen. @entity112 , adopted a similar stance to @entity24 on thursday , even though he had called for possible air strikes on @entity7 in march 2012 when he was seeking the @entity25 presidential nomination			2
" had president @entity5 and then - secretary of state @entity67 acted then in support of pro-democracy forces when that rebellion was taking place , we could have removed @entity47 and helped usher in stability for that country , " @entity112 said in a statement			0
" but we have a very different situation today			0
after nearly two years , 100,000 people killed , a rebel force comprised of @entity128 and a @entity7 regime in a much stronger position , a military strike would no longer be in our national security interest			1
" the positions of @entity24 and @entity112 follow a game plan laid out this week by @entity25 strategist @entity135 , a @entity1 contributor , that called for @entity25 legislators to reject @entity5 's push for congressional authorization to attack @entity7			1
though @entity5 " has told the country he has the power to intercede in @entity7 , he would like to make @entity3 ' president for a day ' so members can share his responsibility , " @entity135 wrote in an opinion piece this week			1
" should @entity7 turn into a car wreck that lasts for years and further destabilizes what @entity5 's weakness has wrought in the @entity152 , the president would prefer to be one of 536 decision - makers , " he added , imploring @entity19 @entity25 to block any vote on authorization			1
the big debate : should @entity39 strike @entity7 ? @entity5 wants to punish @entity47 for what the @entity39 calls a major chemical weapons attack on august 21 that killed more than 1,400 people in suburban @entity160			1
he argues a failure to act puts at risk the credibility of international treaties banning weapons of mass destruction , which would represent a threat to the world			0
lacking international backing so far , the president is seeking congressional backing despite his insistence he has the power to order attacks based on national security interests			0
however , support in @entity3 for a resolution authorizing limited military strikes -- expected to be missiles launched from @entity181 ships -- appears tenuous at this point despite intense lobbying by the president and top officials including @entity75			1
passage by the @entity76 - led @entity21 is more likely than in the @entity25 - led @entity19 , but both parties lack unity on the issue so far			1
@entity190 who traditionally oppose war in any form reject the idea , as do libertarian republicans like @entity68 who say it 's none of our business			0
among those in the middle from either side , the main questions are whether the limited strikes @entity5 proposes will work , and if unintended consequences will lead to @entity39 involvement in another war halfway around the world after more than a decade of fighting in @entity208 and @entity209			0
" we do n't know what 's going to happen the day after we bomb , " @entity76 rep. @entity210 of @entity211 said thursday on @entity1			0
the @entity21 version of the resolution approved by the @entity97 sets a 60 - day deadline for use of force in @entity7 , with an option for an additional 30 days			2
an amendment accepted by the panel from @entity25 sen. @entity221 of @entity222 and @entity76 sen. @entity223 of @entity224 added language to say the military response was intended to reverse @entity47 's battlefield momentum , a stronger objective than had been outlined by administration officials			0
the resolution also makes clear there would be no @entity39 boots on the ground as part of a response in @entity7			2
it now goes to the full @entity21 for an expected vote next week , when the @entity19 also will take up the issue			1
interactive : how the @entity19 and @entity21 will vote			1
a concern for @entity19 members and senators facing re-election next year is a primary challenge by a more extreme candidate who could attack them for backing the president 's proposed military move			1
already , @entity21 @entity25 leader @entity249 of @entity69 and veteran @entity25 sen. @entity250 of @entity251 face primary races against opponents claiming stronger conservative credentials			0
both @entity255 and @entity250 are undecided on a military response in @entity7			1
with polls showing public opposition to a military attack on @entity7 , legislators are facing pressure at home			1
@entity76 sen. @entity263 of @entity264 , who chairs the @entity265 , acknowledged thursday that her constituents do n't like the resolution			0
" every day i get a report on what the calls are , where the calls are coming from , what the nature of the argument is and there is no question that what is coming in is overwhelmingly negative , " said @entity263 , who then added that " they do n't know what i know , they have n't heard what i 've heard			0
" a supporter of a military response in @entity7 who won re-election last year , @entity263 i like to believe now after 20 years i have some skill in separating the wheat from the chaff in this thing			2
" however , @entity25 rep. @entity291 of @entity222 said he remained unconvinced			0
" i agree that there are sometimes that you need to just go out and lead and do what you believe is the right thing to do and hope that you can convince the people to follow , " @entity291 told @entity1			0
" but , right now , i do n't think that this administration has provided a very , very winning argument or series of arguments that we should engage in this conflict			0
