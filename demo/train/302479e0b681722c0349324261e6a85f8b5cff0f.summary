civil rights leader @entity0 sharply denounced an extensive @entity4 report that he and his companies are subject to $ 4.5 million in current state and federal tax liens			1
the @entity10 host said in a press conference wednesday that the $ 4.5 million was the original figure he was ordered to pay back in 2008 , but that he has been making regular payments since then and the amount is now less			1
@entity0 did not give the outstanding balance owed by him and his for - profit companies -- raw talent and @entity18			2
rather , he focused his remarks on how much money his nonprofit group , the @entity21 , has paid back			0
the liens against that organization , however , were not lumped into the $ 4.5 million figure reported by the @entity4			1
the @entity4 reported that @entity0 is still liable for personal federal tax liens of more than $ 3 million , and state tax liens of $ 777,657			1
the companies owe another $ 717,329 on state and federal tax liens			2
but @entity0 argued that it was n't possible that he still owed $ 4.5 million			1
