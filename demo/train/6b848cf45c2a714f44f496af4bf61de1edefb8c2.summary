when @entity2 gave @entity3 a career aptitude test on the ' @entity5 ' tuesday night , her answers alluded to a presidential bid -- and she touched on the disintegration of a @entity9 cease - fire she negotiated two years ago			1
the former secretary of state , @entity12 , first lady and @entity15 member told the @entity17 host that she wants a home office			0
" do you have a favorite shape for that home office ? would you like it to have corners ? " he asked her			0
" fewer corners , " said @entity26			2
it was n't lost on the audience that she was referencing the @entity30 in the @entity31			0
in a web - only cut from the interview , she agreed with @entity2 that the humanitarian crisis in @entity36 is overwhelming			1
palestinians in @entity36 are " trapped by their leadership , " said @entity26			1
" unfortunately it 's a two - pronged trapping , " she said			0
" they have leadership that is committed to resistance and violence and therefore their actions are mostly about how do we get new and better missiles to launch them at @entity50 instead of saying how we 're going to help make your lives better			2
" @entity50 's @entity54 defense system is capable of and successful at shooting @entity56 - launched rockets out of the sky , but " that ca n't be certain " in defending @entity50 from bombardment from @entity36 , said @entity26 , especially now that @entity56 is reportedly sending drones over the border			1
@entity26 pointed to the @entity62 , and former @entity64 president @entity63 , as key allies in the negotiation process between @entity50 and @entity68 that she helped spearhead as secretary of state in november 2012			1
" the @entity56 leadership now feels somewhat trapped themselves because they had an ally with the @entity62 , " she said			2
" i negotiated the cease - fire with @entity63 and @entity63 was able to convince the @entity56 groups to abide by it			0
" @entity26 said that the new , military - led regime in @entity64 , which offered a cease - fire tuesday that @entity50 accepted and @entity56 rejected , sees @entity56 as a " danger			2
" @entity26 said @entity64 's new president @entity81 sees @entity56 as a " source of instability and violence that can affect them in @entity86 and beyond			1
" " so they are trapped , and they 're trapped i would argue first and foremost by leadership that does n't really want to make the situation too much better because that gives them a lot of leverage over the poor people in @entity36 , " she said			1
@entity26 used her third appearance on the show to promote her new book , " @entity98 , " and @entity2 cut her off a number of times			1
" i think i speak for everybody when i say no one cares			0
they just want to know if you 're running for president , " he said			1
" i was going to make an announcement , " she said			0
" but you kind of spoiled it			0
" " it sounds to me like if i may , you 've declared you 're running for president , " @entity2 said			1
@entity2 referred to two books ; ' @entity26 , @entity112 , ' a forthcoming book by @entity114 , the editor of the conservative @entity116 , and ' @entity117 ' by @entity118 , both of which are critical of her and the @entity26 family			1
the host also touched on @entity26 's testimony over the september 11 , 2012 , attacks in @entity125 , @entity126 , that left four @entity127 dead			2
" if you were not running for president , all of this criticism -- there are two books out now that are exposes of the family , there are constant calls for testimony , there are constant parsing of words			2
if you stopped that tomorrow -- if you said , ' i am not running for president ' -- it all stops			2
do you agree or disagree ? " @entity2 asked			0
@entity26 , who has said journalism is now driven more by entertainment than fact - based reporting , said that " if it all stopped , " a lot of people would lose their jobs			0
@entity118 's book , which hinges on multiple anonymous sources to draw a story highly critical of @entity26 , recently overtook @entity26 's own memoir at the top of the @entity154			1
" i 've been amazed at what a cottage industry it is , " @entity26 said			0
to that , @entity2 replied -- referring to himself -- " it 's just these talking heads sitting around , picking out every little thing -- and making fun of it			0
" 6 times @entity26 sounded , acted like a candidate			0

palestinians in @entity36 are " trapped by their leadership , " @entity26 says
