while @entity16 tennis ace @entity15 crashed out of the @entity17 in the first round , her former fiancee @entity13 has been playing some of the finest golf of his career			1
the @entity21 broke off his engagement to @entity15 on may 22 -- ending a three - year relationship -- before going on to win the @entity25 's flagship event -- the @entity26 -- on sunday thanks to an imperious final - round 66 at @entity27			1
@entity13 upped his game further on thursday , posting a nine - under par opening round 63 at the @entity30 in @entity31			1
the world no. 6 leads the field by three strokes , having missed out on the course record by two , and his stranglehold on the @entity38 event could have been even tighter had he not tweaked his left knee on the seventh hole			1

" my performances have been really good , been shooting really good scores			0
there 's just been runs of holes in tournaments where i have n't played so well and i 've shot it four or five over in the space of nine holes , and that 's really just derailed my tournament			0
" last week i just did n't do that and that 's down to nothing more than hitting good golf shots and hitting good putts and limiting my mistakes whenever i get in trouble on the golf course			1
" @entity13 showed little sign of being hampered by his knee injury , which was picked up during his second shot at the seventh			2
" i wear spikes , so sometimes your foot can get stuck in the ground and you can torque your knee a little too much , " explained the 25 - year - old			2
" i think that 's what i did , i tweaked it			0
the inside of it is sore , it 's a little swollen			0
i 'll go see the physio and get some treatment and get ice on it , and hopefully it will be ok for tomorrow			0
" @entity86 champion @entity86 , his fellow @entity88 @entity87 and @entity90 @entity89 are in a three - way tie for second , one shot ahead of 2011 @entity26 winner @entity94 .			0
