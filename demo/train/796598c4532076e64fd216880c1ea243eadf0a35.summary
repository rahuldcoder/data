-- the town of @entity2 is not much to look at -- a heap of @entity5 - style concrete buildings in a deprived and windswept corner of eastern @entity7			1
but it has a rich history -- fought over and colonized since @entity10 -- and a stunning location on the @entity12			2
it has also gained a reputation as a hotbed of jihadists			2
and that has diplomats and analysts asking whether the unrest in @entity7 might provide an opening for @entity22 and fellow travelers , just a short hop from @entity25			1
@entity2 even made it into @entity28 diplomatic cables obtained by @entity29			2
a cable from 2008 describes it as a " wellspring of @entity7 foreign fighters " for @entity22 in @entity34			1
high youth unemployment , discrimination by the @entity38 regime and the influence of veteran @entity7 jihadists from @entity41 all played a role in radicalizing a new generation			1
" other factors include a dearth of social outlets for young people , [ and ] local pride in @entity2 's history as a locus of fierce opposition to occupation , " the cable said			2
" most young men watched a mix of @entity57 news , religious sermons and western action films on @entity61 satellite channels broadcast from the @entity62			0
the result was a heady mixture of violence , religious conservatism and hatred of @entity28 policy in @entity34 and @entity69			0
" today , @entity2 is very much in the opposition 's hands , and accounts from eastern @entity7 say @entity72 and others are fighting side - by - side with one aim : removing @entity38			1
but what comes next ? @entity38 has been quick to raise the specter of @entity22 as the beneficiary of unrest in @entity7 , even claiming that it was drugging young @entity7 into opposing his rule			1
the regime has also paraded a former member of the @entity84 who had allegedly been " captured " during fighting in @entity85			0
while the regime 's claims may seem outlandish , a former leader of @entity7 jihadists tells @entity0 that @entity22 will seek to take advantage of chaos in @entity7			1
" if there is a power vacuum in @entity7 there will be an open market for @entity22 , " says @entity92 , a former commander in the @entity93 and one - time ally of @entity95			1
the @entity84 fought the @entity38 regime in the 1990s , but formally ended its campaign to overthrow the @entity7 regime two years ago , and repudiated @entity22			1
@entity92 is now a senior researcher at the @entity103 in @entity104 , a counter-terrorism think tank			0
having played no role in the rebellion so far , @entity22 and its affiliates will have to play catch - up if they do want to exploit the situation , says @entity92			1
individuals who might have jihadist sympathies are keeping them under wraps for the sake of uniting with one aim : removing @entity38 , he says			2
added to which there has been a broad welcome among @entity7 rebels of all stripes for @entity28 and coalition airstrikes to protect the city of @entity124			1
according to @entity92 , dozens of former @entity84 fighters have now joined rebel efforts to topple @entity38 , but he stressed that they had done so in a personal capacity rather than organizing operations as a group			0
protest movements across the @entity131 -- predominantly secular and pro-democracy -- have so far reduced the jihadist message to irrelevance			2
but @entity92 sees potentially dangerous parallels in @entity7 with neighboring @entity136 and with @entity41			1
after the @entity5 withdrawal in 1989 , the @entity137 walked away from @entity41 rather than use its " soft power " to bring about positive change , he says			0
the @entity141 eventually filled the void			0
as a young jihadist , @entity92 was there to witness it			2
and in @entity136 , a 1992 army coup following electoral gains by radical @entity149 parties spawned a violent insurgency			1
more than 100,000 @entity136 were killed in a savage conflict between the state and @entity149 extremists before the insurgency waned in the mid- 1990s			1
some @entity157 counter-terrorism officials fret that a prolonged civil war in @entity7 could open up space for @entity22			1
governments and @entity161 have to be quick , says @entity92 , in helping rebel - held areas develop education , health - care and the institutions of democracy			0
@entity7 -- like @entity168 -- has a less developed " civil society " than either @entity171 or @entity172 after 40 years of authoritarian rule			1
it also has entrenched tribal rivalries and a small middle class			0
such conditions were compounded by @entity38 's strategy of divide and rule through a baffling array of competing power centers			0
@entity22 has already scented an opportunity			1
its leading ideologue , @entity183 -- himself a @entity7 -- told @entity72 in the country : " store your weapons and do not relinquish them			1
" in an audio tape released on march 12 , he said that " ousting these regimes is not the end in making a change			0
" a week later the leader of @entity192 ( @entity192 ) had a similar message			0
in an audiotape posted on @entity197 websites and translated by the @entity198 , @entity194 told @entity38 's opponents : " we will be side - by - side with you , @entity203 willing			0
" until now , that may be wishful thinking			0
@entity192 has in recent times been restricted to remote parts of @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210 and has suffered leadership splits			0
@entity194 may also have damaged his cause by predicting the @entity28 and @entity213 would never help the rebels because they were the " source of the disaster			0
" but @entity22 is nothing if not persistent			2
and there is a long history of @entity149 radicalization in @entity7 , especially in the impoverished , restive eastern provinces			1
at the peak of the @entity34 insurgency , more jihadists per capita traveled to join @entity22 in @entity34 from @entity7 than from any other country			1
and according to @entity22 records seized by the @entity227 in @entity34 , in 2006 - 07 more volunteers -- a total of 53 -- travelled to @entity34 from @entity2 than any other city in the @entity232 world			2
and in the 1990s , @entity92 's group had tried to establish a safe haven in @entity2 , eventually being bombed into submission by the @entity7 air force			2
which brings us back to the @entity28 cable from 2008 , in which an @entity28 diplomat who traveled to @entity2 , quoted a local businessman who had " likened young men in @entity2 to @entity245 ' character in the action picture ' @entity247 , ' who stubbornly refused to die quietly			0
for them , resistance against coalition forces in @entity34 is an important act of ' jihad ' and a last act of defiance against the @entity38 regime			0
" " it 's jihad -- it 's our duty , and you 're talking about people who do n't have much else to be proud of , " he said			0
maybe that at last is changing .			0
