-- a 2010 video of an airport screener patting down a 3 - year - old boy in a wheelchair has become the latest rorschach test of the public 's attitude towards the @entity8 , pitting agency defenders against those who say the video shows the child being treated like a terrorist			1
posted on @entity14 saturday night by the child 's father , the video had nearly 100,000 hits by monday evening			1
@entity18 , the father of @entity19 , videotaped the incident in the spring of 2010 at @entity22 's @entity21			1
he posted the video after rediscovering it last week , saying he became enraged anew when reviewing it			1
" there is another human being putting their hands on my child			2
that is not acceptable , " he said			2
" if he was putting his hands on my child at @entity33 or anyplace else , we would immediately have him arrested and call the police			2
" the @entity8 noted the agency has changed its procedures since 2010 and said pat downs of children 12 and younger are unlikely , although still possible , under the new protocols			1
under the new @entity8 policy that took effect in september , screeners can work with parents to resolve alarms at security checkpoints			1
among other options , screeners can have the children go through metal detectors or body scanners multiple times or can swab their hands to test for traces of explosives			2
" the new modified screening measures have greatly reduced , though not eliminated , pat downs of children , " @entity8 spokesman @entity52 said			1
" while recognizing that terrorists are willing to manipulate societal norms to evade detection , our officers continue to work with parents to ensure a respectful screening process for the entire family at the checkpoint			1
" children in wheelchairs continue to present special challenges , since the metal chairs trigger alarms in metal detectors and scanners			2
that increases the likelihood of alternate screening methods being used , including limited pat downs , to find the small amounts of explosives experts say could bring down a plane			1
@entity18 said he faults the @entity8 , not the individual screener , who he said tried to calm his son			1
but " i think the whole exercise was intrusive and disrespectful to a human being , and a 3 - year - old human being , " he told @entity0			1
the videotape shows the screener lifting the young boy 's shirt to briefly swab his back , apparently straying from normal @entity8 protocols			1
typically , screeners would only swab a person 's hands and articles of clothing or items they are carrying			2
@entity18 said the screening occurred when his family was departing for a trip to @entity100			1
" i tape - recorded it because i wanted to let the gentleman know that was examining my son that there was a camera on him , and anything that he was going to do , that he needed to be comfortable doing on camera			2
and if he was n't , he needed to stay away from it			2
" @entity18 said he was told he could not stand next to his son during the search			0
" i was told i could n't comfort or hug my son			0
i could n't hug him			0
i could n't hold his hand , " he said			0
" and i tried to make the best out of it			0
but as i 'm standing there as a parent doing this , i 'm thinking about , should i do something more ? should i not ? " @entity18 said he disapproved of the pat down , but did not immediately object because he feared the consequences			0
" my fear was , if i made a bigger deal out of it , then i could be detained , or we could miss our flight , or we could miss our vacation			0
all of these things are dancing around in my head , " he said			0
@entity18 said he forgot about the videotape , but stumbled upon it saturday			0
" as we watched it , i felt like i was in the moment again , " he said			0
" i was overcome with the same emotion i felt -- anger and sadness and frustration			0
" the more i thought about it , the more i thought , ' i 'm going to share this , ' " @entity18 said			0
" i wanted to share with other parents and let them see firsthand what happened			0
" in hindsight , he said , he regrets that he did n't stop the pat down			0
" there has n't been one instance in the @entity146 of a 3 - year - old carrying explosives onto an airplane or doing ill will to anyone , " he said			1
like some other @entity8 controversies , this one resulted in heated commentary on the many internet sites that featured the video			1
" totally unacceptable , " wrote one @entity14 commentator			0
" i look at the abject terror in this tiny child 's eyes , and i know who caused it			0
i know who the terrorist is -- it 's the creep in the blue shirt			0
" " i do n't think a man can be called a creep ... for doing what his job requires him to do , especially since he could be easily fired for not following the rules , " another viewer responded			0
the @entity8 , meanwhile , said a new @entity173 hotline now serves as a resource for passengers with disabilities , medical conditions or other circumstances or their loved ones who want to prepare for the screening process prior to flying			1
@entity8 recommends that passengers call approximately 72 hours ahead of travel so that @entity173 has the opportunity to coordinate checkpoint support with a @entity8 customer service manager located at the airport when necessary			1
travelers can contact the @entity8 , using talk to @entity8 -- a web - based tool that allows passengers to reach out to an airport customer service manager directly			1
they can also reach the @entity190 at 1 - 866 - 289 - 9673 or via e-mail at @entity192 , with questions , suggestions or to file complaints .			2
