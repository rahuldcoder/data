in 2010 , an @entity1 volcano with an unpronounceable name spewed an ash cloud into the skies that disrupted travel for millions of passengers and cost airlines a small fortune			1
now another @entity1 volcano is rumbling , prompting fears of a repeat of the travel chaos that afflicted northern @entity13 when the @entity15 volcano did its worst			1
its name -- @entity17 -- is a little less daunting , but it could still cause trouble			2
something is brewing while there 's no sign yet of magma moving to the surface , according to @entity1 's @entity26 , something 's definitely up beneath the @entity28 's surface			1
in what the @entity26 describes as an " intense earthquake swarm , " scientists registered some 2,600 earthquakes between early saturday morning and monday evening			0
and after the strongest earthquake since 1996 was measured in the area early monday , an orange aviation alert was posted by @entity1 authorities -- indicating " heightened or escalating unrest with increased potential of eruption			1
" " the reason we are reacting in this way is that this one is bigger and more powerful than we have seen in a long time in this area , " said @entity40 , of the @entity1 @entity41 , of the earthquake swarm			2
scientists have noticed an increase in seismic activity around the volcano , located in the northwestern region of @entity53 glacier , one of @entity13 's largest glaciers , over the past seven years , the @entity26 said			1
the level dropped a little after the eruption of another volcano on the same glacier , @entity60 , in 2011 , but has since picked up again			2
earthquakes may signal eruption as of monday evening , the majority of earthquakes measured were at a depth of 5 to 10 kilometers			0
there 's more potential for a volcanic eruption if magma movement occurs at less than 10 kilometers ' depth			1
according to the @entity70 , @entity17 last erupted in 1910			2
if it should blow its top again , it could be bad news for travelers			0
volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft , reducing visibility , damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail			0
the @entity15 eruption forced the cancellation and diversion of thousands of flights per day at the peak of the problem			1
" it was causing problems for millions of passengers , the airlines themselves were losing lots of money because they could not fly , " @entity86 , former director of communications for @entity87 and @entity88 , told @entity89			0
" and the customer relations departments of airlines were really suffering because they were taking huge numbers of complaints and they had no solution			0
" air travel still smooth @entity13 's air authority , @entity102 , said tuesday it was monitoring the @entity17 situation but that there is no impact at this time on @entity13 aviation			1
it also insists that changes have been made to help avoid the kind of chaos seen after @entity15 erupted			0
" @entity13 is more prepared to deal with volcanic ash these days ; we have better mechanisms in place than we did in 2010			0
every year , volcanic ash exercises are conducted and we learn from them : the latest one was held in april this year , " it said			0
" however , volcanic ash is still a hazard for aviation and does have the potential to cause disruption			1
safety is , as ever , our primary concern			0
" road melts at @entity126 @entity127 : the @entity1 town frozen in time by a volcano			2

@entity1 authorities say there 's increased seismic activity around @entity17 volcano
but there 's no sign yet of magma moving to the surface or ash spewing into the *sky*
@entity1 has posted an orange aviation alert , indicating " increased potential of eruption "
the eruption of @entity15 in 2010 caused disruption to millions of travelers
