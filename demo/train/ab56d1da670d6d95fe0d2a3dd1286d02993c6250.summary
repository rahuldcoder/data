@entity0 -- in the end , it might not be the dna evidence collected high atop the @entity5 or license - plate checks on the thousands of cars that crossed the iconic span overnight that solve the giant flag caper			1
in the words of a pair of @entity14 artists -- @entity15 and @entity16 -- the replacement of the @entity18 fluttering above the bridge with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an " art project " by the two performance artists meant to deal with " questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere			1
" in fact , the @entity28 only learned of the artists ' possible involvement after their story appeared on the @entity34 website tuesday afternoon			2
specifically , a law enforcement official said , the video the artists provided to the @entity34 appeared to show the white flags from a position that would lend legitimacy to their claim			1
the claims are being taken seriously , two law enforcement officials told @entity1			1
it 's unclear if the @entity47 district attorney will be able to or even attempt to extradite the men , who told the @entity34 they would cooperate in the investigation			0
in a statement , the artists called the project " @entity53			2
" " they were careful to treat the bridge and the flags with respect and followed the @entity58 , " the statement said			0
" the return of the original flags is in progress			0
like an empty canvas , @entity53 invites many readings , multiple interpretations and projections			0
" at the time of the stunt , many @entity0 wondered whether it represented an act of terrorism or an anti-american statement			0
the @entity72 flags atop the bridge towers were replaced in the overnight hours of july 21 to july 22 , and the white banner s were spotted early in the morning			1
" @entity53 " was meant in part as a tribute the @entity14 - born @entity72 architect of the @entity5 , @entity78 , who left @entity14 in 1831 " in search of a better future in the land of freedom and opportunity , " the artists ' statement said			1
as part of the investigation after the switch , intelligence analysts looked into any possible significance of the day that was chosen to see whether that may yield clues			0
it turned out to the 145th anniversary of the death of @entity78			0
the claim of credit by the artists appears to have taken the @entity28 by surprise			2
@entity28 deputy commissioner for intelligence @entity106 said at a news conference last month that the @entity28 had video showing four or five people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. within the hour , the light that normally illuminates the flag on the @entity5 side of the bridge flickered and appeared to go out			1
a few minutes later the same thing occurred on the tower on the @entity47 side			0
" at this time , it appears it has no particular nexus to terrorism or even politics , " @entity106 said tuesday			0
" this may be somebody 's art project , or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement , but at this point it 's not clear what the statement is			1
" @entity130 's like art project was it			2
" the city has always been a magnet for artists , a metropolis praised as ' the global center of creativity , ' where new progressive art has its place , " the artists said in their statement			0
