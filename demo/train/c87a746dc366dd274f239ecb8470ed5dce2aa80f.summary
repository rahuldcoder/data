-- it 's hard to believe , but there was a time when @entity5 's computers were accused of being strictly last generation			1
their computers were made with clunky power pc processors , and @entity11 owners smirked at the wheezing @entity13 platform			0
@entity14 even famously said the whole company was so behind the times that if it were up to him , he 'd euthanize it			0
while the rest of the industry was counting @entity5 out , a @entity18 newly returned to @entity5 spent the early part of the last decade quietly assembling a time machine			1
following the @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 before it , the retina - display @entity23 announced monday at the @entity28 in @entity29 is just the latest time traveler @entity5 has sent back to us from the future			2
it 's a machine so shiny , so shimmering , so futuristic , so unlike anything else out there that it will take the pc - making competition at least a year to release a truly competing product			0
how did this even happen ? how did @entity5 assemble its time machine , and why ca n't the likes of @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 seem to catch up ? @entity5 announces high - res laptops there 's no flux capacitor involved , and although @entity5 's design team , led by @entity51 , is truly visionary , there are lots of companies with revolutionary visions of the future of computing			1
the difference between @entity5 and other computer makers is that @entity5 can actually build the revolutionary , magical machines it dreams up			0
that 's @entity5 's real mojo			1
@entity5 can say to themselves that they are going to revolutionize the professional laptop , or the smartphone , or the tablet , and then not only follow through with an enviable purity of design , source all of the parts and manufacture their product in utter secrecy , then ship the resulting en masse and sell them at unheard of profit margins			1
it 's all in @entity5 's mastery of the supply chain , which is @entity82 's particular genius			1
his strategy is simple : when @entity5 decides to go ahead and make a revolutionary new product , it buys up literally almost all of the world 's stock of the components that define the gadget			1
this not only gives @entity5 massive discounts in component prices , because they are buying in extreme bulk , but it also prevents the competition from quickly releasing clones of @entity5 's iconic machines , or matching @entity5 in price without cutting corners			1
it happens time and time again			0
when @entity5 first released the @entity25 , it took the smartphone industry a year to release a phone that was even competitive , spec - for - spec , by which time @entity5 had already unveiled the @entity105			2
hardware manufacturers trying to compete with @entity5 constantly discover that they can only build competing devices off of @entity5 's rejected parts , or else build new factories from the ground up to manufacture the parts they need			1
it has no competition , 2Â½ years in			0
last quarter , @entity5 sold almost 12 million @entity24			2
comparatively , @entity5 's biggest competitor -- @entity115 -- sold 1.1 million tablets			1
why ? companies simply ca n't build products as good , or @entity5 's stranglehold on the manufacturing supply chain prevents them from doing so			1
then there 's a @entity26			0
we 're starting to see competitive ultrabooks a year and a half after @entity5 unveiled the second - gen @entity26 , but that 's only after @entity126 reportedly set up a massive $ 500 million subsidy fund to help pc makers build a @entity26 clone			2
the new retina - display @entity23 is another such product			0
it 's a beast of a machine all around , but its defining feature is a high - resolution display with 220 pixels per inch , each smaller than the acuity of the human eye			2
it 's far and away the best display of any notebook or even desktop on the market , and you can bet that @entity5 is in control of most of the world 's supply of the panels necessary to make a machine that even comes close to competing			1
there 's a famous @entity151 story called " @entity152 " in which a man travels into the prehistoric past , accidentally squashes an insect underfoot and thus indelibly changes the future forever			0
@entity5 is that time traveler			2
the prehistoric insect is the competition			0
@entity5 crushes it underfoot with calculated purpose , and that is how the future of computing is once again forever changed			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity167 : unveiling of a new *macbook* is another sign of @entity5 's competitive *advantage*
he says @entity5 does more than *innovate* ; it controls supply chain and *freezes* out competitors
@entity5 's products can then be sold at *extraordinarily* high profit margins , he says
@entity167 : @entity5 has a *virtual* " time machine " with which it 's able to stay years ahead
