@entity0 wins @entity2 in runaway but even as @entity0 became only the second redshirt freshman to win the @entity2 , questions swirled about a rape allegation made against him more than a year ago but made public only last month			1
prosecutors declined this month to file a charge against @entity0 , but a news conference by his accuser 's lawyer the day before the @entity2 presentation kept fueling the story			1
asked about the case on friday , @entity0 -- who has maintained the sexual activity was consensual -- told reporters : " i knew i did nothing wrong			2
" on saturday , shortly before being awarded the @entity2 , he told the audience that he wanted people to know that he was a family man who loved his life and his college experience			2

@entity0 's @entity2 honor comes one day after attorney @entity72 called on @entity74 officials to investigate how authorities in the state capital handled the now - closed investigation into the alleged sexual assault of her client			1
@entity80 accused the @entity82 police detective who handled the case of spending time and resources investigating her client instead of @entity0			2
more than half of the 248 - page investigative file authorities released to her consisted of records related to her client 's telephone , social media and other records , @entity80 said			1
she said only 11 pages of the filed contained references to @entity0 , and some of the material released by authorities differed from those obtained by the woman 's family			1
the lawyer also questioned how investigators handled and tested evidence in the case and said authorities failed to get warrants to examine video surveillance , @entity0 's apartment and other potential evidence that could have proven crucial to the case			1
earlier this month , @entity114 , the state attorney for the 2nd @entity115 , which includes @entity116 and @entity82 , announced that @entity0 would not be arrested			1
a key factor was the accuser 's recollection of the events during the december 2012 incident , in which she alleged @entity0 raped her after she had been drinking with friends at a @entity82 bar , according to @entity114			2
" we have a duty as prosecutors to only file ... charges if we have a reasonable likelihood of a conviction , " @entity114 said at the time			0
" we did not feel we could meet that burden			0
" the prosecutor said investigators did not have even probable cause to arrest @entity0 , which requires a low standard of proof			0
@entity0 's attorney , @entity137 , has said his client had consensual sex with the woman			2
@entity74 attorney general @entity142 has spoken with the head of the @entity144 about the possibility of an inquiry , but no formal request has been received , spokesman @entity141 told @entity148 on friday			0
according to police documents , the woman told investigators she had been drinking with friends at a @entity82 bar called @entity154 's			0
she said an unknown man gave her a shot glass of liquid before they left the bar			0
she said she did not remember much of what happened next but told investigators she remembered winding up in a ground - floor apartment , where a man took off her clothes and had sex with her despite her objections			0
she reported the alleged assault to campus police that night			0
the woman came forward a month after making her initial report to accuse @entity0 , but @entity82 's interim police chief @entity171 said last week that she " broke off contact " with investigators in february and said she did n't want to go forward with the case			1
the woman 's family has claimed that a detective had warned her attorney that @entity82 is a " big football town " and that her life could be miserable if she pursued the case			0
@entity80 said the woman is not contemplating any civil litigation and is focusing on finishing final examinations at @entity1 under special accommodations made by the school			0
she said the woman 's sorority has been subjected to threats and has had some tires slashed .			0
