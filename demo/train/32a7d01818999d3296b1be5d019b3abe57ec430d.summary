it takes @entity1 about five minutes to change someone 's life			1
in that time , the @entity5 doctor can make a small incision in his patient 's eye , remove the cloudy cataract impairing her vision and replace it with an inexpensive artificial lens			1
" some of our younger surgeons even do it faster than that , " @entity1 told @entity12			1
for many patients , it 's the first time they 've seen in years , if not decades			2
in the past 30 years , @entity1 has personally restored the sight of more than 100,000 people across @entity20 and @entity21 , and taught his rapid - fire technique to countless other eye surgeons in parts of the world as isolated as @entity26			1
his patients suffer from eye conditions that are mostly preventable			0
but because of poverty and limited access to public health services they have been unable to seek treatment			2
their story is all too common in the developing world			0
an estimated 39 million people are blind worldwide , according to the @entity37			1
of these , around 90 % live in low - income areas and 80 % suffer from conditions that can be prevented or cured			2
reaching remote communities driven by a belief that the world 's poorest people deserve safe , affordable and high - quality eye care just as much as anyone else , @entity1 has made it his mission to eradicate avoidable blindness			1
in 1994 , he joined the late @entity50 ophthalmologist and philanthropist @entity49 , who was his mentor and close friend , in establishing @entity53 -- an eye hospital in @entity55 dedicated to providing world - class eye care to the people of @entity5			1
the hospital manufactures state - of - the - art lenses that are commonly used in treating cataracts or myopia , and exports them to more than 30 countries worldwide			2
for those who can not reach urban areas , @entity1 and his team conduct mobile eye camps in remote parts of @entity5 and neighboring countries , often trekking for days and cleaning out structures like tents , classrooms or even animal stables for use as temporary operating theaters			1
when the eye patches come off the day after an operation , it 's an incredibly moving moment for all involved			0
@entity50 photographer @entity79 has been capturing these intimate scenes -- the expressions of relief and tears of joy -- while traveling with @entity1 and his colleagues since the early 1990s			2
to mark the 20th anniversary of @entity53 , @entity86 has released some of his most striking images of @entity1 and his team at work in @entity5 and other countries in the region , including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity26 and @entity97			1
infiltrating @entity26 @entity79 , who described @entity1 as " a maverick in some ways , " accompanied the @entity5 surgeon on one of the first trips to @entity26 in 2006			1
the communist state is notoriously closed off to @entity104			0
international aid workers frequently struggle to reach those most in need , in a country where two - thirds of the population experiences chronic food shortages , according to the @entity111			0
but @entity1 , who believes in leaving politics to world leaders , had persuaded the @entity26 authorities to allow his team to conduct the 2006 surgery and training session in the south - eastern city of @entity119 after he had treated one of their diplomats stationed at the embassy in @entity55			1
" it was very restrictive , " said @entity79			0
" we made the same path from the hotel in @entity119 , the same way every day to the hospital , the same way exactly back and that 's all we saw of @entity119 for the seven or so days that we were there			0
" @entity86 describes how the @entity26 surgeons , who came from across the country , were so eager to learn that they huddled close to @entity1 , leaning over the operating table to get a better look as he worked			1
" i 've never seen an eye operation where ( @entity136 ) had so many surgeons around him , " he said			0
in the room where the recovering patients were examined , portraits of then - leader @entity140 and his predecessor @entity141 hung from the wall			0
transforming lives one of the most moving images in @entity86 's collection is that of an 80 - year - old @entity26 man who sees his son for the first time in 10 years after being completely blind in both eyes			1
" of course , the man who 's had the operation is so relieved because he can see again , but the whole family suddenly have a family member who can participate again in everything that happens as home , " @entity79 said			0
patients who are blind in both eyes require constant care , placing a burden on their families that can keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty			2
but this quick - healing surgery allows them to regain their independence			0
the same transformative moment is played out for long - neglected patients in the mountains of @entity5 , the islands of @entity97 and rural @entity95			1
@entity1 grew up in a small village in the @entity172 so isolated that the nearest school was a week 's walk away			2
when he was 17 , his sister died of tuberculosis despite the disease being treatable			0
the loss left @entity1 with a sense of urgency to pursue a path that benefited others , not only himself			2
it 's a decision he does n't regret			0
" i am so grateful that i can make a difference in so many people 's lives , " @entity1 said			1
at 59 , that same sense of urgency that motivated him as a young man remains			0
when asked what it feels like to watch as a patient sees the world clearly the first time , he responded : " it really recharges you and makes you move forward			0
" but he cautioned that there remains so much he wants to do .			0
