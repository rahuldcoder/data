the @entity51 superstar , herself a victim of an unseeded player two days ago , watched as @entity46 slipped to a five - set defeat , 3 - 6 7 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 4 11 - 9 , to @entity56 's @entity55 , in a match carried over from the previous night			1
steady drizzle made for tricky conditions for the players on the outside courts			0
dubbed the " @entity62 " , the 22 - year - old @entity46 often showed his displeasure at the surface as he joined the @entity66 maestro on the sidelines			2
