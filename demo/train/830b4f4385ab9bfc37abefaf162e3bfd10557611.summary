you 're in no danger of falling in , but a large group of possible cosmic vacuum cleaners have just been identified			2
researchers have come upon 26 possible black holes in @entity6 , a galaxy near our own			1
this is the largest number of possible black holes found in a galaxy outside the @entity11 , but that may be because of @entity6 's relative proximity to our galaxy			1
it 's probably easiest for @entity18 - based scientists to find black holes outside the @entity11 there , said @entity20 of the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
combining this discovery with previous observations of nine other black hole candidates , scientists can say that @entity6 has a total of 35 possible black holes			1
the research is published in @entity30			0
@entity32 's @entity31 made more than 150 observations over the course of 13 years to identify these black hole candidates			0
seven of the new potential @entity6 black holes reside within 1,000 light years of the center of that galaxy			1
this supports earlier research showing that , near the center of @entity6 , there are an unusual number of x-ray sources			2
black holes ca n't be seen directly			1
but astronomers can detect material falling into them when they interfere with other stars			1
a black hole is a dense region of space that has collapsed in on itself in such a way that nothing can escape it , not even light			0
in a binary system of this nature , a black hole and a star orbit each other closely			0
material from the star falls into the black hole and " as it spirals in , it gets hotter and hotter , and faster and faster , and eventually it gives off x-rays , so we see lots and lots of x-rays coming out of it , " @entity20 said			2
the material as it has been swallowed gets incredibly hot , up to about 10 billion degrees			0
because of the tremendous amount of energy released , some of the brightest objects in the universe are black holes			2
it 's hard for scientists to distinguish distant black holes from neutron stars , however			1
when a star explodes in a supernova , its fiery death leaves behind either a neutron star or a black hole , which is a more extreme version of a neutron star			0
if our own sun were a neutron star , it would be only about 10 kilometers , or 6.2 miles , across , @entity20 said			0
by comparison , as a black hole our sun might be only 2 kilometers across			0
black holes of the kind that scientists may have spotted in @entity6 have masses that are typically five to 10 times that of the sun. neutron stars have a surface , so falling material pounds onto it , @entity20 said			1
material rains down at enormous speeds , causing huge explosions and energy emissions			0
billions of years from now , the @entity11 and @entity6 galaxies will collide , marking the end of the galaxy as we know it			2
