@entity0 -- diplomatic cables expected to be released soon by @entity3 could contain highly sensitive information that reveals @entity6 negotiating positions , secret intelligence and other confidential matters , a former @entity6 ambassador to @entity10 told @entity1			1
the expected online disclosure has to be taken seriously , said @entity12 , who served as ambassador to @entity14 from 1997 to 2001 and is currently director of the @entity10 and @entity16 at the @entity17			1
" leaking information of this kind will be detrimental to building the trust among officials necessary to conduct effective and productive diplomacy			1
it will impede doing things in a normal , civilized way , " @entity12 said			2
" i would think the information they will leak is likely to contain analysis , records of discussions or reporting on confidential conversations between officials or official policy recommendations or suggestions about policy or diplomatic actions , " he added			0
the threat by @entity3 , the online whistle - blower website , to publish the information has prompted the @entity40 to undertake a massive review of diplomatic documents			1
a source tells @entity1 that every diplomatic mission document from 2006 to 2009 is under review			0
the @entity6 has started to alert nations around the world about the possible leaks			1
in preparation for the @entity3 dump , the @entity50 government warning @entity50 news organizations about the publication of any material which could endanger national security			1
the @entity57 on friday issued a so called " d - notice			0
" in the rarely used notice , the @entity57 told the media that before they publish potentially sensitive stories of a national security nature , they should seek the advice of a senior military official to avoid breaking the order			1
a senior @entity68 government official said the @entity6 government contacted the @entity68 government a few days ago to inform them about the possibility of internal @entity6 communications about @entity68 being publicly released			2
the official would only speak on condition he not be identified			0
he did not know the full scope of what topics the documents may cover , the official said , but noted that @entity68 was told by the @entity6 that the leak was part of a much larger document dump by @entity3 , most of which had nothing to do with @entity68			1
the @entity68 government official added that the @entity6 government said it did not want @entity68 officials hearing about the leak for the first time in the media			1
@entity68 was satisfied with the way the @entity6 was handling the problem and there was little expectation in @entity68 that this would create a major rift in relations , the official said			0
a spokesman for the @entity99 @entity98 , @entity97 , told @entity1 his government also had been alerted by @entity6 authorities			2
" we have been in contact with the @entity6 @entity104 here in @entity106 and they have informed us about a possible release of documents by @entity3 , " @entity97 said			1
" i am , however , not going to speculate on why they contacted us or the reason for them alerting us about this			0
all i can say is that they have told us this might happen			0
" @entity116 also has been contacted , said @entity117 , spokesman at the @entity116 @entity98			0
" they have only told us that @entity3 might release new documents , " @entity117 said			1
" they have n't said anything specific about the contents , they only alerted us that the release might happen			0
" the @entity6 did not discuss whether the leaks might affect relations between the two nations , @entity117 said			2
the information blitz from @entity3 would offer a glimpse into the worldwide communications of the @entity40 and its 297 embassies , consulates and missions through what commonly are referred to as " cables			1
" @entity12 says cables are the telegrams used for official instructions , reports and communications from the @entity40 in @entity0 to its international posts as well as from those posts back to the @entity6			1
much informal communication today is by email and other kinds of modern communications , he says , " but official instructions to the ambassador tend to come through telegrams , which an ambassador can assume have been properly coordinated in @entity0			2
" telegrams , when they go out of the @entity40 , are shown as signed by the secretary of state and when they come in from any embassy or consulate in the field are shown as signed by the ambassador or a principal officer			1
" obviously , " however , @entity12 notes , " these individuals can not and do not write and sign all of the telegrams			0
" embassies send @entity0 " reporting " telegrams , which can include analysis by embassy officers of developments of importance to @entity6 policy in their country or they may report meetings that the ambassador or other embassy officials had with officials in their host country			1
they also can contain substantive policy recommendations and observations			0
in addition , there are housekeeping and operational messages that are dedicated to the daily operations and needs of diplomatic offices and personnel			0
telegrams are an essential means for keeping @entity6 diplomats informed about policy and views in @entity0 and to alert them to important developments			0
the @entity40 sends " world - wide " telegrams to its missions around the world , " regional " telegrams to a select number of posts and telegrams to individual posts			1
" they can be informational , " @entity12 says , " telling the ambassador and his or her staff about a policy initiative , for example : they can send texts of speeches , convey in - house information the @entity40 wants embassies to be aware of or provide the reasoning behind policy , what @entity0 wants clearly understood			1
" another kind of telegram contains official instructions			0
" it says to an ambassador , ' go take this action , ' " @entity12 said , " instructing the ambassador or his staff , for example , to ' see so and so and seek his support for an @entity6 position on @entity225			2
' as an ambassador you would take that instruction , for example and , using it , seek out the appropriate person in the foreign ministry and make the case @entity0 has asked to be conveyed			2
" " the most sensitive kinds of telegrams are instructions such as those to negotiators			0
these instructions were routinely sent to our negotiators on the @entity242 treaty or to those carrying on negotiations with allies about next steps in @entity225			0
" @entity12 says his major concern about leaking telegraphs and other official communication is that " you can not conduct business between governments effectively on @entity1 or in the news media			2
people with whom you talk on a confidential basis , where you 're talking as government - to - government , or representative - of - government - to - representative - of - government and discussing something , implicitly assume that the confidentiality of the discussion will be preserved			2
sure , everyone understands that you 're going to report back to your own government what you said and what you heard , but they do n't expect to see the exchange in the newspapers			2
" similarly , analysis that mentions names or says , ' no matter what everyone else is saying , we think the place is going to fall apart next week ' is very sensitive , " @entity12 says			0
" it 's not that you 're trying to cover up somebody 's mistakes			0
it 's that you can not expect people to provide their superiors candid advice and analysis if they expect to see their views politicized and made public			0
" if @entity3 is putting out a whole raft of embassy reporting from @entity14 or @entity40 instructions on @entity10 policy this is not good news , " @entity12 told @entity1 , " because these cables almost certainly will say things that will complicate relations between and among people involved , create resentments about publication of private information , and decrease the fragile confidence that has been building between the two governments			1
it could also reveal strategies or intentions to the detriment of our diplomatic strategy and tactics on a number of issues			0
and it can simply make life very difficult for embassy officers and other officials working to conduct our relations with @entity10 , depending on how all of this is released			0
" in @entity314 , the @entity6 ambassador to @entity313 told a group of journalists friday that diplomats " are worried about additional documents coming out			1
" ambassador @entity319 said , " @entity3 are an absolutely awful impediment to my business , which is to be able to have discussions in confidence with people			1
i do not understand the motivation for releasing these documents , they will not help , they will simply hurt our ability to do our work here			2
