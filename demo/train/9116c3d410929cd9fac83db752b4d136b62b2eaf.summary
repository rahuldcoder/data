-- finally , after days of listing on a disabled carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets , thousands of passengers finished disembarking early friday morning at the @entity5			1
the frustration that many felt was typified by @entity8 , one of the first passengers to get back on land			1
horrible , " @entity12 told a scrum of reporters			0
" the bathroom facilities were horrible and we could not flush toilets			0
no electricity and our rooms were in total darkness			0
honestly , think that this ship should have ever sailed out			1
" the @entity22 , became a major media story , when it caught fire off the coast of @entity26			1
the blaze left the vessel listing to the side , drifting in @entity26 currents and the more than 4,200 passengers and crew on board in limbo			1
it took five days for the ship to dock at the @entity37 , three days after it was due			1
family members cheered as the ship pulled in and in the crowd also was carnival ceo @entity40			1
the ceo had his own message for the weary passengers : sorry			1
" we pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience , and clearly we failed in this particular case , " he said			2
the beleaguered ceo went on the ship as passengers departed and delivered another apology			1
but for some , like passenger @entity53 , it was too little too late			2
" the hallways were toxic , " said @entity54 , who said she would never go on a carnival cruise again			2
if that ship caught on fire and they had not contained it where would we be ? floating in the ocean or dead			1
" others were more forgiving			0
" they did a good job of managing expectations , " said @entity68			2
" the information that trickled out was probably well thought out to kind of keep people safe and calm			0
" despite the ordeal , many passengers had nothing but praise for the crew , saying they had worked long shifts to make sure their guests were as comfortable as possible			1
" no power , no toilets , nothing			0
i mean , it was was disgusting , but the staff , they did such an amazing job , " said @entity82			2
" and i give them so much props because they were amazing through it all			0
i mean , they worked their tails off to accommodate everybody 's needs			0
" five things we 've learned about cruising @entity99 officials , @entity101 members and a carnival team boarded the ship before it arrived in port to help speed efforts to get passengers off as quickly as possible , he said			1
some families gathered at the @entity37 , far from where the ship was originally supposed to dock in @entity109 , @entity110			2
@entity111 said her family reported they had a hot meal thursday morning and crew members were trying to clean up the ship as it neared port			1
boredom and stress at some point during the ordeal urine and feces streamed in the halls and down walls after toilet facilities failed , soaking the mattress of a friend of his who was sleeping in a hallway , said @entity128			0
emergency power failures caused section doors to slam shut , panicking some passengers who had no idea what was happening			2
" we definitely ( were ) not adequately informed , " @entity128 said			0
opinion : the dirty secrets below decks @entity128 said toilets on the ship worked on and off , but were too inconsistent to trust			2
he said waste tipped out of some commodes and sloshed across floors as the ship listed to the side			2
" it runs down the walls from one floor to the next			0
it 's running out of somebody 's bathroom out into the hallway all the way across , " he said			0
long lines for food and frequent delays were constantly aggravating , he said			0
" here we are looking for hope that , hey it 's 6 o'clock , it 's going to get better , " he said			0
" and 6 o'clock comes and goes and all of a sudden an announcement at 8 , ' hey , we 're running behind schedule			0
' well , no joke			0
" the incident aboard the ship scared @entity128 's daughter and a friend taking the cruise with her , @entity128 said			2
" as soon as you get them calmed down , the electric goes out and doors start slamming shut , " he said			0
during less stressful times , passengers passed the hours playing cards , walking the deck and going to see what was happening on other areas of the ship , @entity128 said			1
passengers set up charging stations to help their fellow passengers juice up cell phones and other devices , he said			2
aboard the cruise ship ? share your story with @entity186 the final trip home carnival promised an army of about 200 employees would take care of its passengers once they cleared customs			1
passengers boarded buses to @entity109 , where the cruise originated , or @entity198 , or went to spend the night in a hotel in @entity200			2
@entity189 said it had reserved about 100 motor coaches , more than 1,500 @entity200 hotel rooms , multiple charter flights from @entity200 to @entity198 on friday and transportation from @entity198 to the @entity205 so that guests may retrieve their cars if they drove to the port			1
carnival officials had initially planned to tow the ship to a @entity213 port , but after @entity26 currents pushed it farther north before tugboats could take control , and considering that 900 of the passengers do not have passports , the company decided to take the @entity22 to @entity219 instead , where it can be repaired			1
compensation for travelers the cruise line said it would give each passenger $ 500 , a free flight home , a full refund for their trip and for most expenses on board , as well as a credit for another cruise			1
the @entity101 and the @entity232 launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire			1
because the @entity22 is a @entity238 - flagged vessel , the @entity236 is the primary investigative agency			0
read related : cruise safety drill results in 5 deaths travelers have few options for compensation in these cases , other than what the cruise line is already offering , according to travel expert @entity247 of @entity249 , a travel website			0
" the passengers on the ship are n't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home , " he said			1
travel " insurance really does n't cover this sort of thing			0
their trip was n't interrupted and they are n't incurring extra expenses ... so they ca n't be compensated that way			0
" still , there 's no denying that the fire and resulting bad @entity267 will hurt carnival			1
" it 's a terrible sight , thinking of people trapped on a ship with limited food and filthy conditions , so i think people will think twice about taking a cruise , " @entity247 said			1
read related : what caused the @entity278 ship disaster ? bad luck before the fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late january , when it had an issue with its propulsion system , according to a notice posted on the website of carnival senior cruise director @entity288			1
it 's also not the first fire to disable one of the cruise line 's ships			2
in 2010 , the @entity294 lost power after an engine room fire , leaving it drifting off the @entity297 of @entity26			1
the @entity298 ferried 60,000 pounds of supplies for the ship 's passengers and crew as the ship was towed to @entity304			1
after this ill - fated cruise , the @entity22 wo n't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-april			0
carnival has canceled a dozen voyages scheduled between february 21 and april 13			0
that makes a total of 14 scratched trips			0
the cruise line already had eliminated voyages slated for february 11 and february 16			0
