-- you ca n't smoke in most restaurants and malls , and those laws may be responsible for saving thousands of lives			0
according to two separate studies , recent laws that limit smoking in public places are contributing to fewer tobacco - related hospital visits and deaths			1
in 2009 , the @entity12 concluded that smoking bans contributed to fewer heart problems in areas where the policies were implemented , but the panel was unable to determine how much benefit the laws provided			2
the new research provides some objective improvements in lower heart attack rates and adds to a growing body of evidence for the tangible health effects of stricter smoke - free laws across the @entity26 and @entity27			1
since 2000 , more than half of @entity26 states have enacted laws to restrict indoor smoking , and new smoke - free policies have taken hold in countries such as @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity38			1
although these regulations are relatively new , researchers are eager to document what effect they have on health ; with strong data , public health experts hope that more smoke - free policies will be considered in countries where smoking - related deaths continue to cost nations in health and productivity			1
@entity0 : can @entity51 kick the habit ? for one of the two new studies , published in the @entity58 , scientists at @entity55 's @entity54 analyzed effects of smoke - free laws that were introduced in @entity61 , @entity55 , over the past 10 years			1
most of the county 's more than 144,000 residents receive health care from the @entity54 , allowing the researchers to obtain consent to track heart - related health outcomes			0
in 2002 , @entity61 required restaurants to be smoke - free , and a few years later passed even stricter anti-smoking laws , mandating that all workplaces , including bars , become smoke - free in 2007			1
when they compared the 18 - month period before the restaurant ban to the 18 - month period directly afterward , the researchers found a per - capita drop of 33 % in the number of heart attacks in the county , and a 17 % drop in the number of sudden cardiac deaths			0
the decline occured at the same time that rates of hypertension , diabetes and other heart - disease risk factors either remained constant or increased , suggesting that the effect was primarily attributable to the more rigid smoke - free laws			1
the study 's authors also adjusted for the effect of other community anti-smoking efforts , and the drop in heart attacks remained strongly tied to the new policies			0
in the second study , published in the journal @entity101 , researchers at the @entity97 , @entity98 ( @entity97 ) took a different tack			0
they analyzed the combined the results of 45 previous studies that focused on 33 different smoke - free laws worldwide and their impact on health			1
@entity0 : how second - hand cigarette smoke changes your genes like the study in @entity61 , the @entity97 meta - analysis showed a clear health benefit for regions that go smoke - free			2
areas that restrict public smoking saw a prompt and sustained decline in both hospital admissions and deaths from a variety of causes related to smoking , including heart disease , stroke , and many lung conditions			2
in these regions , the @entity97 researchers showed an average decline in heart attack hospitalizations of 15 % -- less than the @entity54 study , but , the @entity132 authors note , their analysis took an average of hospitalizations ; some regions may have benefited from far fewer health effects attributable to smoking , while others saw slighltly less benefit			0
" all people should avoid secondhand smoke to the extent possible , and people with coronary heart disease should have no exposure to secondhand smoke , " the authors of the @entity54 study wrote , noting that many of the heart - related health problems of smoking occur in non-smokers who are exposed to second - hand smoke			0
they say that their data should support continued expansion of smoke - free laws			1
@entity0 : smoking ban ? the @entity158 light up again in public @entity160 , director of the @entity161 at @entity97 and the senior study author on the circulation paper , has argued previously that smoke - free laws work to improve health not only because they protect non-smokers from harmful health effects of secondhand smoke , but they also protect smokers , by discouraging them from smoking as much , or even encouraging them to quit			1
despite the growing evidence supporting their health benefits , however , critics of the laws argue that smoking bans limit the freedom of smokers to choose when and where they smoke			0
smoke - free advocates often argue , in response , that restrictions are needed to protect the rights of non-smokers to remain tobacco - free -- and to protect the freedom of workers in bars and restaurants to avoid the potential health fall - out from their customers ' risky habits			2
the new evidence is n't likely to settle this thorny debate over personal freedoms , but , the authors hope , the results may sway more lawmakers to take the negative health effects of smoking more seriously in protecting public health			0
heart disease remains the country 's leading killer , and a policy that limits its toll can be hard to ignore			0
this story was initially published on @entity0			0
smoke - free laws are saving lives			2

laws that limit public smoking play a role in fewer hospital visits and deaths , studies show
more than half of @entity26 states have taken steps to limit public smoking since 2000
smoke - free policies have also been enacted in some other countries
