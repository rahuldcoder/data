@entity0 -- the @entity3 news network suspended political analyst @entity4 on thursday after the @entity6 columnist used a four - letter insult to describe president @entity8			1
@entity4 quickly apologized for the remarks , in which he told fellow panelists on the " @entity17 " program that @entity8 was " kind of a d -- k " for blasting @entity13 lawmakers during a wednesday news conference			1
he had been told the program was on a seven - second delay before he delivered his assessment			1
he delivered what he called " an absolute apology , heartfelt " to @entity8 and to viewers after a commercial break and remained on the air			1

@entity40 spokesman @entity39 called the remark " inappropriate " and said he had " expressed that sentiment to executives at the network			2
" " i have no comment on that , whatever action that network -- any network , any newspaper , whatever -- might take , because that 's not for us to decide , " @entity39 told reporters			2
the exchange began as the show 's host , former @entity53 rep. @entity53 , questioned whether @entity8 's wednesday criticism of @entity13 leaders was merely " showmanship " ahead of tough negotiations over raising the federal debt ceiling			2
" are we on the seven - second delay today ? " @entity4 asked			1
" i wanted to characterize how i thought the president behaved			0
" he was told the delay was in place , with co-host @entity64 telling him , " go for it			2
" @entity53 added , " i 'm behind you			0
you fall down , i 'm going to catch you			0
" @entity4 then said , " i thought he was kind of a d -- k yesterday , " as @entity70 and @entity64 responded with a combination of shock and laughter			2
what are you doing ? " @entity53 said			0
" i ca n't believe you			0
did we delay that ? " told later that the delay had n't worked , @entity4 noted the remark " may have ended my career			1
" after a break , he said he was sorry for the comment			0
" this is not a pro forma apology , " he said			0
" this is an absolute apology , heartfelt , to the president and to the viewers			0
i became part of the joke , but that 's no excuse			0
i made a mistake , and i 'm sorry and i should n't have said it			0
