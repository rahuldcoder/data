-- for a film with such a straightforward title , " @entity3 " turns out to be remarkably convoluted			2
poised precipitously atop a high - concept premise , @entity4 is an escaped convict attempting to prove his innocence in the most elaborate way possible : he climbs out onto a hotel ledge and creates a suicide spectacle / diversion that allows his brother ( @entity12 ) to steal a diamond from an iniquitous real estate baron played with a perpetual scowl by @entity16			1
it 's all ostensibly part of a master plan , as is his requesting @entity20 ' beleaguered negotiator , but it feels as if the filmmakers have tried to stuff the plots of too many different movies into a single casing that 's already overflowing with eye - rolling improbabilities			1
despite the occasional dumb fun -- especially with the heist portions -- the leap of logic required to make it all work is enough to leave your brain pancaked on the sidewalk			0
