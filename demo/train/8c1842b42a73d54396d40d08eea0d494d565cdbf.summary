@entity0 -- women shake their hips seductively and children dance in flip - flops to booming electronic music while young men brandish pistols and the occasional assault rifle			1
it 's just another funk party in one of the lawless favelas on the outskirts of @entity0			1
since 2008 , when authorities launched a so - called " pacification " effort , police have stormed dozens of slums to squeeze out criminal gangs and make the city safer for residents as well as the hundreds of thousands of tourists expected for the @entity23 , which starts next month , and the 2016 @entity24			1
initially , police targeted shantytowns closest to tourist hot spots , the iconic favelas that cling to hills overlooking @entity30 and @entity31			1
but far from the sunny beaches and pretty promenades that line the coast , drug gangs still reign supreme			1
even during the day , the drug business is brisk and carried out in the open			1
armed men , often just teenagers , stand watch at corners and communicate by radio as housewives , workers and children coming home from school walk by			1
sales are made from a plastic table erected on a corner , piled with little baggies of marijuana , hashish , cocaine , crack , even an inhalant containing ether			0
money is stuffed in plastic containers			0
the local dealers agree to talk while they carry on with their trade			2
" what we sell most is the famous white powder , the 20 - real hits , " says @entity60 as he holds up little baggies of cocaine , worth about $ 8			2
a hit of crack costs about $ 2 and a baggie of marijuana about $ 4			0
they say most of their customers are locals , but they increasingly have more clients coming from @entity0 's wealthier neighborhoods because of the heavier police presence there			1
@entity60 , 22 with bleached hair , wears board shorts and flip - flops and has an @entity81 slung over his shoulder			2
" i was born in the middle of trafficking			0
i did n't see any other alternative , " he says			2
" if i could choose a profession , i would be a fireman or a doctor			0
" for decades , @entity0 's favelas were neglected by authorities , considered no - go zones even by police			1
rival drug gangs fought for control			1
they became judge , jury and executioner -- and a part of daily life			0
@entity60 says : " if i told you i was n't afraid of dying it would be a lie			2
if i told you i avoided death , it would be a lie			0
i would n't be here trafficking if it were true			2
" but he says he thinks the greater police presence would make life worse for his community			2
under the controversial pacification program , police have reduced crime and killings in the communities where they have seized control from drug gangs , but they have also come under fire for strong - arm tactics and excessive violence			1
in some cases they have been accused of murder			0
police are investigating some allegations but say they are isolated incidents			0
in the hundreds of far - flung shantytowns that have n't yet been included in the program , feelings are mixed			1
a community organizer , who asked not to be named , said a police presence should just be the first step for greater participation in city life			0
" what we need here are opportunities for our young people , like job training and internships , " he said			0
" the police just come in here wanting to break heads			0
" but for @entity148 , a former trafficker now interned at a drug rehabilitation shelter , pacification would be a way for his community to break free			1
" my community lives in a constant war zone			1
there are people who support the traffickers , but they always want something in exchange : they want your son or they want you to leave your door open so they can escape from the police			0
they always want something , " he says			0
but most people seem to agree that the police first have to convince communities they wo n't just pack up and leave once the @entity23 and @entity24 are over .			0

drug gangs still reign in @entity0 shantytowns that have n't seen @entity173 *crackdowns*
' pacification ' is *credited* with reducing crime but accused of using heavy - handed tactics
residents carry on their lives with drug deals on corners and teens carrying guns
one former trafficker says : " my community lives in a constant war zone "
