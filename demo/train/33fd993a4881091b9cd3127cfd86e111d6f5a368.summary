-- there are many ways to lose or ruin your smartphone			1
@entity5 , crime , gravity , anger , intoxication , acts of @entity11			1
the devices are increasingly tied into our lives , and being without them can be a huge loss			2
they 're also not cheap , especially if you 're not eligible for a carrier - subsidized upgrade			2
but between theft , water damage and our own clumsiness , accidents happen			1
here are some stories of smartphone woes			1
share your own in the comments			2
thieving smartphones are easy to spot , steal and resell , making them a popular target for thieves			2
mobile apps have been created specifically for tracking down misplaced or stolen mobile devices , and police are learning to handle the cases			2
the year 2008 was a different time -- there was not yet a @entity39 app to aid vigilante justice			2
that 's the year @entity41 , a 5 - foot - 1 broke grad student , splurged on and was quickly separated from an @entity44			2
while riding the 6 train in @entity46 late one night , @entity41 took out her new phone and started playing a maze game			1
" normally i was careful to keep the phone out of sight while traveling , but it was late and i was bored and , like a little kid with a @entity53 , excited to play all these new games , " said @entity41			1
suddenly , a teenage boy about twice her size ran past , grabbed the phone out of her hands and dashed through the train door			1
@entity41 chased the thief full - speed and managed to grab him by the shoulder , but he got away with her phone			1
when @entity41 called the @entity65 , officers were more concerned about her physical well - being than the fate of her smartphone			1
angry but unhurt , @entity41 took the subway home where she still had an old @entity70 bar phone			1
she immediately reactivated and dropped $ 5 on @entity71 for the " dumb " phone			1
( " i am really , really good at cell phone @entity71			1
" ) @entity41 stuck with feature phones until 2011 , after her heart and wallet had time to mend , but she 's still incredibly cautious in public			2
now she lives in the @entity79 , where she works as an immigration lawyer			2
she never takes the @entity39 out on @entity82 public transit , except for @entity83 , which ferries many workers to and from their jobs in @entity86 , because it " somehow seems safer since it looks like an @entity89 commercial on there during rush hour			2
" drowning smartphones and water do not mix. but 70 % of our planet 's surface is covered with the stuff , so statistically they 're bound to meet			2
photo producer amber saw not one but two of her iphones die watery deaths , one glamorous and one in a toilet			2
while working on a photo shoot in @entity105 , @entity106 , she was ( playfully ) pushed into a pool with a smartphone still in her pocket			1
the phone was her primary way of communicating with everyone working on the shoot			1
she took it to the @entity116 in @entity117 , but they could n't revive the phone			1
she ended up borrowing an older @entity44 to use the rest of the trip			0
cut to two years later , when @entity98 's adventurous 1 - year - old daughter decided to toss mom 's @entity123 in the toilet			0
she somehow firmly lodged it into the drain , where it became stuck			0
" i 'm trying to pull it out before the phone is 100 % damaged , trying every tool known to man as fast as possible			1
the 1 - year - old is jumping all excited at the show , screaming because she wants to play with me in the toilet , " recalls @entity98			0
the phone stayed stuck until her husband came home eight hours later			1
photos of the wee phone - destroyer 's first birthday party were all lost			1
@entity98 was n't eligible for a new phone yet , so she had to pay full price for a new device			1
she also sprung for @entity144 and a $ 90 waterproof case			0
though it did n't work with @entity98 's phones , sometimes a device can be revived after getting wet			0
one common remedy is to make sure the phone is off and submerge it in uncooked rice overnight , which will draw out the moisture			1
breaking we 've all seem them , the people with cracked screens who still use their smartphones			0
usually the cracks just create a little web over the screen , and the phones are still perfectly usable			0
but not all the time			0
@entity0 ireporter @entity165 , a 20 - year - old college student , was hanging out on his roof with friends when he placed his phone down in what he thought was a secure spot			1
he did not consider the dangers of receiving a text while the phone was on vibrate			1
yes , a few minutes later he watched his phone slide down the rooftop and plummet to the ground			1
" hearing the phone hit the cement below was one of the most gut - wrenching sounds i had ever heard , and i do n't think anyone has ever climbed down from a rooftop as fast as i did that night , " @entity165 told @entity180			1
the damage was n't fatal			0
the phone still worked , but the glass was cracked and all but one section of the screen had gone black			1
even black , the touch screen still worked			0
amazingly , @entity165 found a way to make the phone usable			1
to read a text message , he would take a screenshot , go into the @entity197 , and move the image around to read what it said			0
unable to see the keyboard , he typed from memory			0
to make a call , he had to have a person 's number memorized			0
and to listen to music , he learned to navigate through his collection by memory			0
he even uses it as a camera , explaining , " i just have to kinda guess what i 'm taking it of but it usually works out and they all turn out normal on my laptop			0
" it 's been seven months , and @entity165 is still using his iphone			0
at first he did n't replace it because he was broke , but now he 's grown attached to it			0
" over time this phone has become almost a part of me ( as weird as that sounds )			1
i just ca n't believe that it has survived this long so i feel bad just pulling the plug on it			0
" repairing @entity165 's experience is not unusual			0
oftentimes smartphones are , in the words of @entity230 , " only mostly dead			0
" you can learn to cope with your hobbled device , you can drop money on having it fixed by a professional or you can attempt to fix it yourself			0
while attempting to grapple with a screaming child and a car seat , @entity236 dropped his month - old @entity240 smartphone , and its screen shattered			1
( if there is a theme here , it is that children are bad for the health of smartphones )			0
the company wanted to charge buizer $ 150 to replace the screen on his $ 200 phone			1
he decided to replace the cracked screen himself using instructional videos on the @entity261 , a $ 20 replacement screen and a set of small drivers and pry tools			0
the surgery took just over an hour , but there was a small crack in the frame that held the glass			0
over the past year and half , a fine white dust found its way into the phone through that crack , settling between the glass and touch pad , accumulating in the center of the screen where he scrolls most			1
" i am guessing this is from static build up			0
whatever causes it , i now have a hazy white spot directly in the center of my screen , said @entity236			0
" @entity282 to say , i ca n't wait for my new @entity39 to arrive			0
" tinkering finally , there are the people who bring on the damage themselves			0
the tinkerers , the geeks , the dreamers			0
designer @entity289 likes to mess with her devices , but admits she does n't always know exactly what she 's doing			0
the first time she tinkered under the hood of a smartphone , everything worked out just peachy			1
she decided to root her @entity240 phone ( rooting is a way of getting total control of the operating system , bypassing pesky safeguards and limitations put in place by the company that made the phone )			1
she also put a custom rom -- a standalone , customized version of the @entity310 operating system -- onto the phone			1
she got the phone to work on a different carrier and was quite pleased with the results			2
her next phone was a @entity317			2
it was on @entity319 , since she was on a mission to try out all the low - end phone carriers			2
she rooted the phone successfully again , but when she put on a custom rom , something went horribly wrong			2
the external hard drive was no longer accessible and her phone was bricked			2
" genius that i am , i did all that two days before a work trip , " said @entity289			0
" i went to the @entity330 store , and signed my life away for two years , after being license - free for years			0
" @entity39 5 users complain about purple photos			0
