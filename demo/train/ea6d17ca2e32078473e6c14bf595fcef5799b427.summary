-- @entity2 's future at @entity3 is in doubt after the @entity6 club confirmed on saturday that the @entity8 playmaker will not be considered for selection until he agrees to take a pay cut			1
the 28 - year - old is one of football 's highest - paid players , but he has struggled to regain the heights of 2010 when he helped the @entity16 reach the @entity18 final after a treble - winning season with @entity3			1
he has not played for the cash - strapped @entity22 side since september 26 , at least partially due to injuries , but now @entity3 technical director @entity24 says he will stay on the sidelines until he accepts a " contract adjustment			1
" " the situation with @entity2 , who is part of the history of this club and a player we all care about , is that we 've been discussing a possible -- and for us necessary -- adjustment to his contract for a while , " @entity24 said in quotes reported by @entity3 's website			1
" we want to give the player and his entourage all the time they need to consider the terms of our proposal carefully , so the coach and the club have decided not to use the player in this period until things are clearer			0
this also allows our coach to give more playing time to the other players			0
" in the same interview , @entity24 revealed that @entity3 coach @entity53 will not have any funds to bolster his second - placed team 's title charge during the january transfer window			2
" as things stand , the current economic situation -- both generally speaking and in our specific case -- does n't allow us to budget for any sort of outlay , " @entity24 said			0
when asked if @entity3 could afford to sign highly - rated @entity64 midfielder @entity63 , @entity24 replied : " if there 's a ' costs ' we ca n't do it at the moment			1
" the announcement is likely to spark a january bidding war for former @entity71 star @entity2 , who has been linked with a move to the @entity73 for the past two years			0
@entity3 's financial problems mirror those of city rivals @entity75 , who have sold several top names since winning the @entity6 title in 2011			1
@entity24 said @entity3 would not be rushing @entity2 , who moved to the @entity79 in 2009 and has more than two and a half years left on his contract			1
" it 's a very serious matter			0
we 're patient precisely because we have a certain sort of relationship with @entity2 , and i 'm sure it 's the same for him			2
we 're patient and calm as we wait for the situation to evolve			0
" @entity53 's team travel to @entity90 on monday , facing the possibility that champions @entity93 ' four - point lead will be even greater following sunday 's trip to struggling @entity3			2
in saturday 's only @entity22 game , seventh - placed @entity95 lost 3 - 1 at @entity97			0
@entity99 midfielder @entity98 scored twice in the second half to lift the @entity102 team up to 14th place .			0
