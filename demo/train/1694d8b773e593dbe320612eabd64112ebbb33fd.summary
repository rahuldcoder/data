-- after months of being beat up by the media about his " @entity6 " scandal in @entity4 , gov. @entity5 is still standing			1
and there is even some evidence that he might finally be regaining ground			2
a new poll from @entity12 shows that the governor has narrowed the lead that @entity15 , another possible presidential candidate , has over him in @entity16			1
his appearance on " @entity20 " and at a charity softball game in @entity19 generated some media buzz about the more likeable parts of his personality			2
although his political reputation is a long way from repaired , the idea that the governor might still run in 2016 is back on the table			2
how can this be ? a number of factors have helped him absorb the continued blows that he has received from the constant news coverage and ongoing investigations into the events that transpired in the @entity4			1
the dynamics of the scandal have followed a few principles about surviving scandal politics that have worked in his favor			2
avoid the smoking gun : this is the biggest one			2
until investigators have clear - cut evidence that a politician is responsible for the scandal at hand , there is always room for a person to maneuver			2
in certain cases , @entity53 voters are willing to give the benefit of doubt to the person accused -- especially in a heated partisan environment where investigations and accusations often turn out to be unfounded -- until there is evidence in hand that the politician is guilty beyond any doubt			0
whether the evidence is a recording of @entity69 conversations ( @entity70 ) or pictures on @entity72 ( @entity73 ) , it 's not usually over before this information actually emerges			0
the absence of a smoking gun of illegal activity has been very important in this case since , to many @entity53 , so much of the story -- leaning on politicians , favoring friends and intimidating enemies , making politics a top concern among the staff -- all seem like politics as usual in @entity4			1
time your scandal well : as with everything else in politics , timing is everything when it comes to scandal			0
it matters very much when a story breaks			0
with @entity5 , the timing was good and bad			1
the revelations about the bridge began at a real high point for the governor when the media was virtually nominating him to be the @entity105 nominee on their own			1
so the impact of negative information was dramatic			0
but the story also broke a long time before any presidential primaries started			0
there is a huge amount of time still remaining until the political season really begins			0
this means that @entity5 has had some time for the noise to die down and the worst of the coverage , thus far , has taken place when nationally many people are not paying attention			1
the virtues of the scandal happening early are amplified in a rapid - fire media age where reporters turn their attention to the next big story quickly and the readers and viewers are quick to move on			0
keep governing : @entity5 has followed the @entity128 playbook			1
when faced with bad press and damaging allegations , keep doing the job that you were elected to do			0
during the past months , @entity5 has continued to focus on his work in @entity4			1
he has been steadfast in his effort to convey the image of a politician most concerned about the challenges facing the electorate rather than the challenges he faces as a result of the scandal			0
he has also used his fundraising and appearances with the @entity147 to continue to remind voters and member of the party of the assets that he can bring to the table as a party leader			0
by doing so , he continues to give the public opportunity to evaluate him a leader in action , rather than just the subject of investigation , and to charge that the accusers are more concerned in scandal than solving problems			0
remind your party that they need you : one of @entity5 's greatest virtues is his party			1
even with all the problems that president @entity169 has faced , the @entity105 remains greatly damaged			1
the party has suffered in the polls as a result the way in which republicans have governed in @entity174 , as well as continued disapproval of president @entity176			0
many of the possible candidates , such as @entity179 or @entity180 , are untested or have serious potential weaknesses , such as @entity179 's noninterventionism at a moment that things are heating up overseas			0
@entity5 receives considerable protection just from the fact that @entity105 do n't have so many alternatives			1
desperate to regain the @entity69 , @entity105 have been willing to give him some slack as the story unfolds			1
to be sure , it is far from clear whether @entity5 will ever regain the strength he once had			1
the recent news about a second scandal involving alleged securities laws violations connected to a major road repair might rekindle public interest in his wrongdoing and potentially produce the smoking gun that has not yet emerged			0
but at this point , @entity5 is still showing some signs of life and remains a player on the political field			1
he still has the potential to join the list of politicians who have stared scandal in the face and survived politically			2
join us on @entity215 / @entity214 .			0

@entity217 observes how gov. @entity5 has remained politically *viable*
the @entity4 governor appears so far to have *weathered* " @entity6 "
@entity105 need @entity5 as a candidate and want to win , he says
