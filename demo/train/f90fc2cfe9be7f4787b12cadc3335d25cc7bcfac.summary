-- in keeping with their vow to prevent any more of president @entity6 's appeals court nominees from being confirmed until after the election , @entity2 @entity1 successfully upheld monday their filibuster of judge @entity10 's nomination to the 10th @entity12 @entity11 , which is based in @entity13			1
the filibuster came despite praise for @entity10 from the two @entity1 senators from @entity17 , where he is currently a federal magistrate judge , and the support of three centrist @entity1 who voted across the aisle			1
the vote was 56 - 34 , several votes short of the 60 the @entity23 needed to break the filibuster			1
each @entity17 senator , torn between their support for the nominee and their desire not to undermine their @entity2 leadership , voted present			2
@entity30 : why are tax increases radioactive ? in upholding the filibuster , @entity1 invoked what is known as the @entity34 , named after late @entity36 @entity35 sen. @entity35 , a former longtime @entity37 member			1
the informal rule , which has been practiced by both parties for decades , justifies the blocking of a president 's pick for an appeals court judge months before a presidential election			1
" the rationale has been that this close to an election , whoever wins that election should be the one to pick these lifetime nominees who will run our judiciary system , " explained sen. @entity45 of @entity46 , the top @entity1 on the @entity37			1
@entity1 leaders signaled last month they soon would block appointments to the powerful circuit courts , which are one level below the @entity12 @entity61			2
@entity23 said they had hoped to get @entity10 through before the rule took affect and argued that never before had a circuit court judge who was voted out of the @entity37 with bipartisan support been filibustered			0
tax vote is more about november vote senate majority leader @entity69 , @entity70 , called @entity10 " well - qualified " and lamented that the pattern of @entity1 filibusters would now extend to circuit court judges			2
" why should we be surprised , though ? " @entity69 said on the floor			0
" we 've already had 85 filibusters , so just add another one to it			0
" @entity45 said that @entity23 have used the @entity34 in the past just as @entity1 are now			1
in fact , @entity1 call it the @entity80 , because they said the @entity23 chairman of the @entity37 , sen. @entity82 of @entity83 , has invoked the rule before			0
" now they do n't want us to play by the same set of rules , " @entity45 said			0
" the @entity23 leadership does n't want us to enforce the rules that they helped establish			0
" democrats wo n't touch gun control in addition , @entity45 argued @entity69 knew @entity10 would be filibustered and put his nomination up for a vote anyway in an effort to paint @entity1 as obstructionist			0
@entity1 sens. @entity96 of @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , both of @entity100 , voted to end the filibuster			2
@entity1 sen. @entity102 , a longtime @entity1 member of the @entity37 , voted present .			0
