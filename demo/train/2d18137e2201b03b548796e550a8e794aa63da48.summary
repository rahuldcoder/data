-- it has long come as a mystery to soccer fans : how can @entity7 , with a population of 1.2 billion and a burgeoning passion for football , be languishing at 162nd in the world rankings below @entity9 and @entity10 ? it is an anomaly that organizers of the country 's new @entity14 franchise hope to tackle , with their model that intends to echo the success of cricket 's money - spinning @entity19 tournament -- a shortened format of the sport featuring some of its biggest entertainers			1
six former legends of the game , including @entity27 and @entity29 midfielder @entity28 and @entity32 's @entity31 - winning captain @entity30 , have signed up for the inaugural tournament due to start in february			1
the @entity34 has signed a 30 - year deal with the @entity36 and hopes to create a new surge of popularity for soccer in one of the most densely populated countries on earth			0
six teams will participate in monday 's auction in @entity45 to acquire stars of football 's past			1
the list also includes former @entity50 forward @entity51 , who won three @entity53 titles with @entity54 , @entity56 striker @entity55 , @entity58 legend @entity57 and @entity61 's former @entity60 star @entity59			1
each club will have a maximum of $ 2.5 million to spend in the first year , with no team allowed more than four foreign players			0
each squad must also contain six under - 21 @entity7 players			2
it is a concept that @entity69 , executive director of @entity34 , hopes will transform the fortunes of the nation 's soccer team			2
" the @entity14 has already created a huge interest among fans , players and sponsors			0
it 's a great chance to be associated with global brands , " he told @entity0			0
according to @entity69 , around 155 million @entity7 watched football on television in 2010 , and a study in 2009 by the @entity83 found that 47 % of the population would describe themselves as soccer fans			1
but there is no question that @entity7 is cricket crazy , with revered batsman @entity89 , known as the " @entity89 , " sure to trump former @entity91 and @entity92 footballer @entity90 as an icon on the sub-continent			1
though @entity69 denies the @entity14 will be similar to the @entity19 , there are many similarities -- not least the hope that big names will add a large helping of glitz and glamor to proceedings			2
the annual 20 - over cricket competition has proved a huge success since it launched in 2008 , with the world 's best players auctioned off to the nine teams , set against a backdrop of @entity110 bling			1
however , @entity69 prefers to look elsewhere for a comparison -- @entity91 football 's @entity14			0
" if i have to benchmark myself , i will benchmark with the @entity115 , which is the most successful league across the world , " he said			0
" moreover , the @entity14 will actually complement football in @entity7			2
it will create a new market , a new audience and will produce more homegrown talent , " he said			0
sports analyst @entity121 told @entity0 that football was now the second most - watched sport in @entity7 behind cricket , and that the @entity14 could prove a game - changer			1
" this is a very good attempt , " he said			0
" there are foreign players , foreign coaches and , if it is conducted like the @entity19 with proper planning , the @entity14 too can be superb			0

@entity132 *announces* it will launch in late february
the tournament has echoes of @entity7 's successful @entity19 cricket competition
