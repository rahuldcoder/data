-- a stuffy , overcrowded cell			2
at times , two or three men to a single bunk			2
lockdown for 23 out of 24 hours			0
is this what awaits @entity9 's @entity8 if he is not released on bail while he awaits trial for the murder of his girlfriend ? some of @entity9 's prisons are better than others			1
but whichever one might house @entity8 , there 's no question that conditions would be a far cry from those in his $ 560,000 home in the luxury @entity24 , on the outskirts of @entity26			1
@entity9 prisons are frequently overcrowded , putting a strain on sanitation , ventilation and medical care , according to @entity32 , project coordinator for the @entity34 - based @entity33 , a civil society group			1
the overcrowding means three men may share a single cell , or communal cells for 40 people are jammed with double the number they were intended to hold , with men sleeping in double or triple bunks , she said			1
" we heard of one person who for the first year in remand detention slept on the floor and then ' graduated ' to a bunk , " she said			0
remand is the term used for pretrial custody			2
many inmates are kept locked up for 23 hours a day , with only an hour outside their cell			2
some prisons go into lockdown as early as 3 or 4 p.m. , leaving prisoners cooped up for 12 hours or more at a stretch			1
" it 's not a pretty picture , " @entity32 said			2
overcrowding is a particular problem in remand prisons , where it runs at just over 200 % , she said , citing figures from the @entity65			2
overall , overcrowding in prisons stands at about 133 %			2
and @entity69 , perhaps the most likely destination for @entity8 if he does n't get bail , " does n't have a very good reputation , " @entity32 said			1
special treatment ? the track star 's high - profile case is likely to thrust @entity9 's criminal justice system under the spotlight			1
questions have already been asked about why @entity8 , a gold medal - winning @entity78 , is being detained in a holding cell at the @entity81 -- and not at @entity69 or @entity82 , where other defendants awaiting trial are kept			1
" if there is some special circumstance that permits this , authorities must share this with the public as they are setting a bad precedent , " the women 's branch of @entity9 's ruling party said in a prepared statement			1
" all should be treated equally before the law no matter your standing in society			0
" @entity8 is getting special treatment , the @entity99 said , adding that his family can visit him outside visiting hours -- unlike relatives of other inmates			1
" if @entity8 is denied bail , he must be moved to a proper prison facility with others accused of similar crimes , " the statement said			1
" a strong message must be sent out that wealth and celebrity can not give you an advantage over the law			0
" the 26 - year - old has rejected the murder allegation " in the strongest terms , " his agent said in a statement			0
@entity8 ' lawyers requested @entity81 last week so that they could have access to their client over the weekend , following his arrest thursday			1
the state did not object			0
the case of @entity127 , a @entity128 man accused of hiring hitmen to kill his wife on their @entity9 honeymoon , cast the country 's criminal justice system in an unflattering light			1
his lawyers argued last year that his extradition would breach his human rights under @entity139 law because he risked being attacked by other inmates in @entity9 prisons			1
while @entity128 @entity147 judges dismissed that part of @entity127 's argument , concerns about potential torture and abuse in detention are warranted , @entity32 said			2
@entity9 is a signatory to the @entity151 , but it has yet to ratify it , so such abuses have not been criminalized			1
" a legacy of apartheid is that prison cells are still unfortunately a place where prisoners can be abused , " @entity32 said			2
@entity160 's @entity159 2012 , which looked at human rights around the world , also said that a draft law to make torture a criminal offense had not been presented in @entity9 's parliament by the end of the year			1
human dignity nevertheless , said @entity32 , the problem does n't lie in @entity9 's laws so much as in the ability of the justice system to cope with the number of inmates in the system			1
@entity9 's constitution and its bill of rights , with regard to prisoners ' rights , are among the best in the world , she said			1
" unfortunately , that does n't necessarily translate into practice			0
" she says she thinks conditions are improving , however , thanks in part to the strength of those constitutional rights and the work of civil society organizations campaigning for change			0
and @entity8 , if he ends up spending time on remand or is eventually convicted and jailed , should find that his particular medical needs as a double amputee are taken into account , she said			2
this could mean that he is sent to a prison with better medical facilities or wheelchair access , she suggested			0
according to the bill of rights , prisoners are entitled to " be detained in conditions that are consistent with human dignity , including at least exercise and the provision , at state expense , of adequate accommodation , nutrition , medical treatment			2
" @entity216 spokesman @entity215 said @entity9 's detention facilities , whether for remand prisoners or those serving prison terms , " can accommodate people with any disabilities			1
" " we have a general problem of overcrowding but we have learned to live with it , " said @entity215 , adding that extra bunks have been added to make sure all remand prisoners have a bed			0
hospital facilities are also available at all times , he said			0
according to official figures for 2011 to 2012 , there were 158,790 prison inmates in @entity9 , a nation of nearly 52 million , of whom about 30 % were on remand awaiting trial			1
this compares with about 2.2 million people in prisons or jails in the @entity243 at the end of 2011 , according to @entity243 @entity246 figures			0
crowding in @entity243 prisons stood at 39 % over capacity in 2011 , according to a @entity250 report			0
long wait for trial @entity32 blames systemic problems for @entity9 's overcrowding			1
one issue is that police are quick to arrest people , she said , and they have only 48 hours from arrest to bring charges			0
after they are charged , many suspects can not afford to make bail or hire a lawyer and so are forced to spend months or even years behind bars awaiting trial , she said			1
investigations are often poorly run and courtrooms can be overcrowded , adding to the hurdles faced by those on remand , she said			0
" because the system is cumbersome and slow , there 's a lot of people stuck waiting -- and that means the conditions are not by any means ideal , " she added			0
a " statement of agreed factual findings " filed in a @entity280 ruling in december , in favor of a man who contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned , gives insight into what could lie ahead for @entity8			2
the statement describes the conditions @entity286 endured in @entity288 's @entity287 -- where @entity289 was once held -- before he was eventually acquitted and freed			0
prisoners going to court appearances were " stuffed into vans like sardines , " it said			0
holding cells at court were also " jam - packed			0
" meanwhile , conditions back at the prison were far from pleasant -- though ideal for the spread of disease			0
packed , smoky cells the air inside the communal cells , locked down without cross-ventilation for up to 15 hours a day , was thick with cigarette smoke , the statement said			0
even after @entity286 was diagnosed with @entity308 , he was kept in a cell with other prisoners			0
he " begged , bullied and bribed " to get the medication he needed			0
as a world - famous athlete , @entity8 has money to pay for good defense attorneys , unlike many in the @entity9 justice system			1
he stated his annual income was 5.6 million rand ( $ 631,000 ) at his bail hearing this week			0
nonetheless , his lawyers face an uphill battle on the bail issue , with @entity9 law requiring evidence of " exceptional circumstances " to justify the release of defendants accused of premeditated murder			1
if they fail , @entity8 could face several months on remand before his case goes to trial			1
and if convicted of premeditated murder , he would face 25 years in prison before being eligible for parole			0
his lawyers will be trying to make sure that does n't happen .			0

@entity9 's prisons are generally overcrowded , says the @entity33
some single cells house two or three inmates , and ventilation is often poor
lockdowns keep prisoners cooped up in cells for long *periods*
@entity8 could spend months in custody awaiting trial if his *application* for bail fails
