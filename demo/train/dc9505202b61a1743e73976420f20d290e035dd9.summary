congressional democrats are upping the pressure on president @entity2 to fix what 's ailing his signature health care initiative with some in the party warning they may be forced to back a @entity9 @entity8 proposal if the @entity9 does n't offer an alternative by week 's end			1
" we 've got to get out of the bunker and fix these problems , " a senior congressional @entity13 source told @entity15 's chief congressional correspondent @entity14 of flaws in the newly rolled out law that have energized @entity8 efforts to weaken the president and his allies and derail a policy they have long considered unworkable			1
the @entity9 has until friday to devise a solution to the problem - plagued roll out of the @entity29 , the source said			1
that 's when @entity31 will take up a bill to address one of the more politically potent @entity29 problems for the president and @entity13 -- those losing their health coverage due to the law despite @entity2 's assurances in selling it to the public that @entity41 could keep their plans if they wanted			1
the @entity9 bill would allow those insurance plans to extend into next year and gut a major part of the law by allowing anyone to purchase them , even though the existing policies do n't meet the tougher requirements of the @entity29 initiative			1
poll : @entity2 approval ratings drop , @entity41 say he 's not trustworthy among other things , the @entity29 prohibits discrimination for preexisting conditions and mandates coverage for mental health , prenatal care and other issues			1
this is a primary reason why insurance companies are dropping existing coverage			2
" in the absence of a solution that @entity13 can support from the @entity9 , you will see more and more democrats voting for the @entity65 bill , " the @entity13 source said of the plan being advanced this week by @entity66 chairman @entity65 of @entity67			1
fewer than 50,000 sign up on @entity29 website , media report suggests cancellations drive concern although the rocky rollout of the @entity29 website and expected low enrollment figures for the first five weeks of the program are embarrassments for the president and @entity13 in @entity83 who rammed through the health law in 2010 without @entity8 support , it is the policy cancellations that are really driving @entity13 to put more pressure the @entity9			1
@entity2 has apologized to those losing their coverage despite his assurances to the contrary and appears to be taking a hit for his @entity29 woes , according to the latest polling			1
his approval rating among @entity41 voters has dropped to its lowest number in @entity100 polling since he became president with new doubts being raised about trust			0
things could get even more heated on wednesday when @entity9 chief technology officer @entity106 will testify before a congressional committee investigating the rocky rollout of the @entity110 website , the @entity2 administration said			2
@entity111 had been subpoenaed to appear by @entity113 chairman @entity112			0
pressure to come up with a fix rep. @entity116 , the no. 2 @entity117 in the @entity9 , told reporters that @entity2 needs to come up with a solution " sooner rather than later			1
" while @entity121 @entity13 rep. @entity120 , chairman of the @entity122 , criticized the @entity9 @entity8 plan , saying he believes it would increase premiums and remove consumer protections			2
" we should do something so long as it actually fixes the problem and does n't make the problem worse			0
" @entity132 told reporters tuesday , saying it would be helpful if the @entity9 came out with a proposal before friday 's @entity9 vote			1
he noted a @entity9 official will meet with @entity13 on wednesday and played down the notion they are breaking with the administration on the issue			2
but rep. @entity143 of @entity144 , a loyal liberal and former @entity145 , said he has n't seen details of the @entity9 @entity8 bill , but said he thought it could " make sense " and that there " could be support " depending on the approach			2
@entity116 said earlier he had n't ruled out being open to @entity65 's bill , but his spokeswoman says he 's now opposed since @entity65 has said he wo n't make changes and @entity13 leaders will likely urge their caucus to vote against it			1
boosting pressure further on @entity2 was former president @entity159 , who said on tuesday that the president should find a way to uphold his initial promises about health policies			1
@entity159 : @entity2 should ' honor commitment ' on keeping health plans " i personally believe , even if it takes a change in the law , the president should honor the commitment the federal government made to those people and let them keep what they 've got , " @entity159 said during an interview with the website @entity168			1
a @entity178 @entity13 approach a growing number of @entity13 have called for changes or delays to the program as many face tough reelection bids in 2014 and are feeling pressure from challengers and constituents			2
@entity29 rattling @entity13 nerves although he did n't go nearly as far as @entity159 , sen. @entity190 , @entity191 , said he is open to changes as well and noted that @entity2 should have been more careful with his words in the first place			1
" a couple more sentences added would clarify it , " the @entity178 's second - highest @entity117 said on @entity15 's " newsroom " with @entity196			0
he said very clearly he was sorry if he misled people			0
" @entity190 added that @entity8 and @entity13 " need to be open to constructive changes to make this law work better			2
" sen. @entity203 of @entity204 , introduced a narrower bill than what @entity9 @entity8 are planning with @entity65 's plan and said that she has growing support in the @entity178 , including @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 and @entity212 -- all @entity13			1
she noted her proposal would allow people who have individual insurance , which she says makes up about 5 % of the market , to keep their coverage			2
insurers would have to notify those customers what minimum coverage requirements are not being met			0
" @entity222 , ( @entity2 ) apologized			0
and he 's also apologized for the poor roll out			0
and again , these things are real problems and they have to be fixed , " @entity203 told @entity15 's chief congressional correspondent @entity14			0
" but the promise of the @entity29 , let me say again , is worth fighting for			0
and republicans that continue to think that they 're going to undermine it , repeal it , or defund it are wrong			0
they 're on the wrong side of history , " she said			0
@entity9 spokesperson @entity237 said @entity2 agreed with @entity159 and is working to address the matter of people losing their coverage			1
he has already set in motion an aggressive effort to fix the website problems			0
behind the scenes : fixing the @entity29 website @entity237 rejected the @entity65 bill as " not an effective fix " because it opens up the plans to anyone , not just the people who 's plans are being canceled			1
" the president has instructed his team to look at a range of options " to find solutions for people who have lost their plans , @entity237 said			0
enrollment woes @entity13 anger over the cancellation of insurance policies come as people wait for the release of enrollment numbers			2
what will obamacare enrollment numbers tell us ? the @entity2 administration is expected to release them by the end of this week but has yet to say exactly when			0
@entity9 officials are is lowering expectations , cautioning the numbers " will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated , " @entity237 said			0
it is blaming a faulty federally run website that is hindering the ability of consumers to sign up for coverage			0
" we are working 24 - 7 to ensure that the site is working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of november , " said @entity280 , deputy assistant to the president for health policy			0
