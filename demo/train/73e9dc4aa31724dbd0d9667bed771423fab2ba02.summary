@entity3 spokeswoman @entity27 told @entity2 partner web site @entity28 that the " glitch " was being fixed , but declined to elaborate			1
" this is an embarrassing and ham - fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection , " she wrote in an e-mail statement			1
" it has been misreported that the issue was limited to gay & @entity37 themed titles -- in fact , it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as @entity43 , and @entity44 , " the statement said			1

of course it was an error , yes , " was the sardonic response from @entity113			0
