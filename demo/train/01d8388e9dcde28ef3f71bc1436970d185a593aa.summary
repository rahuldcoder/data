@entity0 , @entity1 -- whether i was squeezing myself into a crowded subway car or admiring the fall leaves around at @entity6 , i was constantly learning new @entity8 words during my two - week study trip to @entity10 last october			1
when i came back , i had vague notions of continuing my linguistic education through classes and books			0
unfortunately , i could n't find any convenient classes , and the textbooks did n't hold my attention for long			0
i had basically given up when , about two months ago , i came upon the opportunity to use a program called @entity20			1
having refreshed my vocabulary with it , i then turned to the @entity23 to see what other resources were available to help me stay on top of my language learning			1
here 's what i 've found : free online learning with the boom in social media , it makes sense that learning a language online would take on a @entity36 - like component			1
my general impression is that these are great ways to exchange languages with people all over the world , but you might not always get helpful feedback			1
with @entity45 , you get to learn the language of your choice while helping others who want to speak your native tongue			1
once you complete a structured lesson , you submit your own writing and audio recordings to other users for feedback			2
reading a sentence aloud and then sending my recording off was pretty intimidating , but i got a response within 10 minutes from a girl in @entity58 who gave it five stars and a " good ! ! " -- although she was surely too kind			0
i also got to review @entity62 submissions from other users , which felt especially gratifying because i had just been in their uncomfortable situation of sending off my words to strangers			2
there 's also @entity69 - 8 , which is all about the practice of writing			2
you essentially keep a journal in the language you are practicing , and others in the online community read and correct it			2
want more structure ? the @entity78 gives out awards every year for outstanding language - learning web sites : read the full list			1
no @entity8 sites made it there , but for @entity85 ( my second language ) they cite a wonderful ( and free ) interactive refresher called @entity85 and @entity87 with @entity88			1
this site uses popular @entity85 songs , photo essays and other activities to teach grammar and vocabulary			2
it 's intended for people who have had some exposure to the language , however			1
iphone apps if you 've got an @entity101 , you 've got a way to get exposure to your language of choice wherever there 's adequate reception			1
in general , i 'm kind of in awe of the idea that i can have a pre-recorded voice pronounce words as many times as i want so i can match it ( although standing in the subway and repeating the same foreign word over and over might draw some unwanted attention )			2
first , i checked out @entity117 , an @entity101 app that offers practice in 15 languages , including @entity8			2
the free version shows and pronounces 132 words in " study " mode			2
in " flashcard " mode , you get a word in @entity62 and then touch the screen to " turn over " the card and hear and see the @entity8 translation			0
i like that you can listen to each word as many times as you want before you think you 're pronouncing it right			0
the quiz , though , is only 10 words , which are the same in the audio version and do n't seem to vary			0
however , $ 7.99 will get you access to more than 2,100 unique words			0
this seems like a good supplement for language learning but not ideal on its own , especially since there 's no speaking or writing practice			1
for some , @entity144 , also available in multiple languages , may be more useful			2
for $ 7.99 , you get flash cards with audio and pictures , and i feel that both elements are essential for my own learning of new words			0
the app comes with 1,000 words , which is less than half that of @entity117 , however			0
i am intrigued that you can use this app to see how your vocabulary words are being used in real time on @entity156			0
for those without an @entity101 , you can get free version of @entity144 for @entity159 or pc , or a " deluxe " version you can use to import vocabulary lists to the @entity101			0
paying more for immersion the gold standard of computer - based language learning seems to be @entity20			1
here 's what i love : it forces you , like a real situation in a foreign country , to stretch the limits of your understanding but gives you feedback so that you learn and progress			1
instead of memorizing words , you confront pictures and learn to describe what 's going on			1
in the two months since i started the beginning @entity8 levels , i 've been exposed to a variety of everyday vocabulary words through pictures and constant audio reinforcement			0
it is gratifying at the end of each unit to have a " milestone " activity in which you interact with the people in pictures , simulating the frustration you feel when you forget how to say something basic off - the - cuff in a new language			2
the obvious downside for this program is the cost : $ 229 for @entity8 level 1 , for instance			0
some people , such as myself , are able to get @entity20 through corporate programs or universities			1
the other downer , depending on what your needs are , is that there is no explicit explanation for why the grammar is used the way it is			0
in other words , i have no idea what the different " cases " are in @entity8 , even though i understand that endings of words change in different constructions			0
on the other hand , small children who grow up fluent in @entity62 do n't learn that in @entity62 the phrase " if i had known " is in the " pluperfect subjective tense " ; they just learn to say " if i had known			0
" a rival to @entity20 is @entity220 , which is less expensive ( $ 179 for the complete edition ) and owns the @entity144 products mentioned above			1
but @entity159 users beware : it 's only for pc			1
use it or lose it ? all of these resources have shown me that , although i let many months lapse before trying to resume my @entity8 , i have n't lost it all			0
in fact , @entity230 , linguistics professor at the @entity231 , says that if you spent a significant amount of time interacting in a language at some point -- even a decade ago or more -- a lot of it may return			0
" it seems to be that the higher your ability level that you attained to begin with , the more likely it is to come back later in life , " he said			0
he also noted that , although your ability to learn a new language goes down with age , it never goes away completely			1
a 20 - year - old will learn faster than a 40 - year - old , who will learn quicker than a 60 - year - old , but anyone at any age has the ability to take on a new tongue			1
i believe these digital resources are worthwhile tools for improving your language skills			0
of course , nothing replaces the learning , and the joy , that comes with negotiating daily life in a different language in a foreign place .			1

web sites such as @entity45 have language exchange among site users
iphone *applications* allow foreign language study on the go
@entity20 works by immersion but is expensive
person 's ability to learn languages never goes away , expert says
