@entity11 , head of the @entity12 , told @entity0 's @entity13 that consensus will help legitimize the government in a nation where the people seek a restoration of order			1

" it has nothing to do with who prevails in those elections or those who do not prevail			0

@entity11 said the absence of a civic structure in @entity4 , which was dismantled by leader @entity51 during his decades in power , means people of all political ideologies can be part of a new government and its 200 - seat parliament			1
" it 's an opportunity that all parties , all political forces can have a new start where all of them can participate and take part in the reestablishment of the state , " he said			1

" if i can contribute to the national interests of my country , i will not hesitate			0
but if there is a role where i can not do anything within that role , then i will not take part			0

the parliamentary vote is a litmus test for @entity4 in the @entity121 era			0
@entity122 took place 17 months after political demonstrations against @entity51 broke out in two @entity4 cities			1
those demonstrations spread , leading to a civil war , @entity129 airstrikes and @entity51 's death by a bullet to the head in october			2
while @entity51 's death ended much of the violence , unrest continues in parts of the country , particularly the south and the west , and the government has not been able to contain the militias that helped overthrow @entity51			2
