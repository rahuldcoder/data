-- a bungled break - in , @entity2 , a defiant president @entity3 declaring , " i am not a crook			0
" these are what often come to mind when people hear the word @entity10			1
but another legacy of the infamous scandal has re-emerged in this year 's presidential race			1
many @entity14 may not remember , but public outrage over @entity10 led to the enactment of a series of campaign finance reforms designed to restore the country 's faith in government			1
while the nation marks the 40th anniversary of the @entity10 break - in later this year , some observers say our political leaders have already forgotten a key lesson of @entity10 : that anonymous money corrupts political campaigns			1
opinion : it took a scandal to get real campaign finance reform " @entity10 was basically a campaign finance scandal , " says @entity35 , a political science professor at @entity36 in @entity37			1
@entity35 and others say this historical amnesia can be seen in the @entity14 @entity43 's @entity42 decision , which allows corporations and unions to give unlimited campaign donations to so - called super pacs as long as those political action committees are not coordinated with a candidate 's campaign			1
@entity51 can quickly pull in huge amounts of money			2
they have the option of disclosing their donors and donations either semiannually or quarterly in a nonelection year , and quarterly or monthly in an election year			1
critics say super pacs are dangerous because they can delay disclosing details of donations until after elections take place , and they can easily work around restrictions against coordinating with a candidate 's campaign			1
" @entity42 will lead to a future that will make @entity10 look tame , " @entity35 says			1
" there will be more elections with fewer controls , more spending and great secrecy			2
the @entity74 regulations are , in effect , dead			0
" others say the @entity10 reforms actually hurt the election process and that the damage can be seen in this year 's presidential race			1
the @entity74 restrictions on campaign fundraising inspired savvy political operators to devise more backdoor ways than ever to steer big money to candidates , says political scientist @entity87			1
campaign operators usually stay ahead of campaign reformers , says @entity87 , a professor at the @entity90 in @entity91			2
he points to the 2002 @entity93 law as an example			0
the law set strict limits on contributions to candidates and parties			0
the result : the rise of " independent " pacs that can receive up to $ 5,000 from an individual or a national party committee in a calendar year			2
pacs often make it easier for a candidate 's supporters to attack their opponents , @entity87 says			2
" the candidates can not be held accountable or responsible for anything pacs say on their behalf , even if there are scurrilous charges that amount to pure mudslinging , " he says			0
a slush fund from the very beginning of @entity10 , campaign contributions were intertwined with the scandal			1
it began on june 17 , 1972 , when a security guard called @entity123 police after discovering white masking tape plastered over a door in a sprawling apartment and office complex known as the @entity10			1
five men in business suits were arrested for breaking into the offices of the @entity131			0
investigators later discovered that one of the burglars had a $ 25,000 check from president @entity136 for the re-election of the president ( known as @entity140 , or @entity141 ) deposited in his bank account			0
nixon aides had dispatched the burglars to the @entity131 headquarters to gather intelligence on his political opponents			0
to cover up the break - in , the president would take the nation on a two - year series of events that came to be known as @entity10			1
before resigning in disgrace in 1974 , @entity3 would order wiretaps for reporters , misuse the @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 for political purposes , and prompt a showdown with the @entity43			0
at the end , 30 government officials were convicted , and a disgusted nation began to lose faith in government			0
keeping illegal donations hidden was a prime concern of the @entity169 after the arrests , says @entity171 , a former @entity172 editor who helped lead coverage into the scandal			1
@entity3 did n't just cover up a burglary			0
his re-election campaign chiefs had asked for and received millions in illegal , secret contributions from major @entity14 companies			1
" they went around with a very heavy hand , telling corporations that we 're going to win and you better get on board			0
you do n't want to be against us , " says @entity171 , author of " the great coverup : @entity3 and the @entity188			0
" that 's called extortion			2
" so much secret money was pouring into the @entity169 that there were reports of bags of money being delivered to @entity3 's re-election campaign , says @entity197 , chairman of the management department at @entity200 's business school			1
" there was a slush fund , " @entity197 says			0
" they were extorting money from corporate interests with the threat of using the @entity157 to audit them if they did n't comply			2
" corporations expected something in return , and @entity3 delivered			0
his administration intervened in an antitrust action against one corporation that had given it money and relaxed regulations for a milk company that had done the same			2
congressional investigators who discovered @entity3 's shakedown of corporations decided that the campaign finance system needed to be reformed , says @entity221 law professor @entity220			1
" there was a widespread public perception that the political process had been thoroughly corrupted , " @entity220 says			0
" public policy seemed to be up for sale to the highest bidder			0
" why reforms faltered @entity229 attempted to change that perception by passing laws that created a system of public financing for political campaigns			2
disclosure laws were enacted to root out secret donors			0
limits were placed on campaign donations and private expenditures			2
( a candidate , for example , ca n't use campaign money for noncampaign spending			1
) a bipartisan @entity244 would monitor compliance with the reforms			2
yet those reforms were challenged almost as soon as they were enacted			2
in 1976 , a divided @entity43 in @entity248 stuck down campaign expenditure limits , equating money with free speech			1
two decades before the @entity43 's decision in @entity254 , the judiciary was already gutting @entity10 's electoral reforms , @entity220 says			1
" thanks to @entity256 and its progeny , including @entity42 , the @entity74 electoral reforms have been all but eviscerated , " @entity220 says			2
" we basically have little if anything left in the way of meaningful , democracy - protecting campaign finance regulations			0
" maybe that 's just as well , some political scientists say -- that the @entity74 campaign finance reforms , and others like it , were never destined to last because the flow of money in politics can never be stopped			1
big money and secrecy corrupts ? the best solution for fighting the potentially corrupting influence of big money in politics , they say , is sunlight			1
" the real remedy is publicity , " says @entity87 , the @entity90 professor			0
" it should be illegal to donate to any political candidate beyond a certain figure -- let 's say $ 1,000 -- or even a political action committee without immediately disclosing it on the @entity289			1
" transparency , though , is n't enough when big - money donors are treated like ordinary voters , says former editor @entity171			1
" that 's not ' one man , one vote , ' " he says			0
" @entity296 can give all they want			0
some speech is overwhelming other forms of speech			0
" @entity171 says many people have forgotten one of the most important lessons of @entity10 : that big money and secrecy corrupts			1
the amount of secret money in this year 's presidential race will dwarf the amount @entity3 extorted , he says			1
" nobody would have predicted that these enormous outlays of secret money would now become legal , " he says			0
but political scientist @entity313 says money is such a dominant force in politics that trying to prevent big - money interests from getting involved is like trying to fight nature			2
attempted reforms of the campaign finance system date further back than @entity10 to the progressive - era reforms of the early 20th century , says @entity313 , an assistant professor at the @entity322			1
demanding transparency in campaign donations may be the most realistic reform possible because it gives voters the information needed to hold candidates accountable , he says			0
" money in politics is like the @entity332 flowing into the ocean , " @entity313 says			0
" you 're not going to stop the river			0
you have to direct it in the ways that will best protect public integrity			0

@entity14 may have forgotten a key legacy of @entity10 , professors say
outrage over illegal campaign fundraising led to @entity10 reforms
*scholars* say these reforms have been erased in this year 's election
