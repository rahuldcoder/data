@entity0 -- the estranged husband of " @entity3 of @entity4 " cast member @entity5 apparently killed himself in his home , according to police and the @entity0 county coroner 's office			1
@entity10 's lawyer said he 's " 100 % convinced " @entity5 's role in the reality show created his depression , but he does not blame the @entity15 network for his death			1
investigators did not find a suicide note near the body of @entity5 , 47 , who was pronounced dead at 8:16 p.m. monday , assistant chief coroner @entity17 said tuesday			1
his body was found in a @entity23 home in the hills above @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity17 said			0
" it does appear to be a suicide by hanging , " @entity28 spokesman @entity27 said			1
@entity5 was the subject of numerous celebrity gossip website stories in recent weeks that detailed allegations of abuse made against him in his pending divorce			1
after @entity5 filed for divorce last month she told @entity41 that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six - year marriage			1
" i felt like i was dying inside , " she told people			0
" now , there 's some sense of peace			0
" in his interview with people , @entity10 said , " maybe things happened in the heat of the moment , but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were			1
this show has literally pushed us to the limit			2
" @entity59 , who was @entity10 's lawyer , said in an interview tuesday with @entity61 , host of @entity63 's " @entity62 , " that the response to the divorce filing was sitting on his desk and had been about to be filed in court			1
" he did not want the divorce at all , but he was willing to accept her decision , " @entity68 said			0
" he tried to fix some of her concerns , but as i 've advised many couples in this area , including mr. @entity5 , these shows have a way of tearing apart a marriage when one spouse takes a certain directions and the other spouse is left kind of supporting the financial part of the marriage			1
" @entity5 , who was defending himself against a multimillion - dollar lawsuit , was financially drained , @entity68 said			1
his credit cards had been suspended , adding to the pressure , he said			0
but his downfall was caused by his role in the reality show , he said			1
" i 'm 100 % convinced and based on facts that this show led to his depression on a couple different grounds , " @entity68 said			1
" one is that the show characterized him as someone that abused his spouse			2
it highlighted ancient financial negatives in his past and put him in a spotlight that he was n't equipped to deal with			0
" his lawyer said the allegations of verbal and physical abuse stemmed from " drunk arguments			2
" " that 's what they were dealing with here , " he said			0
" there may have been the normal type of kind of shoving that drunk people sometimes get into			0
" a combination of factors stemming from the show were " wearing on him , " his lawyer said			2
" there 's the appearance that she 's moving forward as a celebrity , " @entity68 said			0
" he 's now a divorce male with kids and he still has a tremendous debt service that he was handling for both of them that was supporting their lifestyle			0
" the sudden celebrity that followed the @entity5 's appearance on " @entity3 " was overwhelming to the couple , he said			2
" when that sort of stardom attacks a marriage sort of overnight , like in the case of a reality tv star , it 's not like an actor that progressively moves up the ladder and the couple deals with this in stages , " he said			1
" a reality show takes an average person that has no stardom and throws them into a public spotlight literally within a couple of episodes , and a lot of couples are not prepared for that and this is a very unfortunate consequence			1
" still , @entity68 said he does not blame the network for his client 's depression and death			2
" a network can not be held accountable to people 's voluntarily opening of their doors of their private lives			0
the adults that allowed this to happen to them are responsible , " the attorney said			0
" the network is justified in making good television out of their conflict			0
" @entity5 's death should serve as a warning to the dangers people face when they sign up for a reality show , he said			1
" adults need to go into these things with your eyes wide open , ( realizing ) that if you 're going to have a network cover your private life , you become a public figure , people can comment about you and there 's a high degree of probability that your marriage will end up in shambles as a result of this newfound scrutiny by the public and by the tv network that is covering our private lives , " @entity68 said			0
the network that carries the show issued a short statement tuesday morning : " all of us at @entity15 are deeply saddened by this tragic news			0
our sympathy and thoughts are with the @entity5 family at this difficult time			2
" @entity1 's @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0
