-- @entity2 colonies might seem to belong to the age of empires , @entity7 , galleon ships and spice trading			1
but there remains a handful of captivating islands scattered in the remote fringes of the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 that still belong to some of the world 's more powerful nations			1
@entity18 and @entity19 officially : @entity20 of @entity21 located in the @entity14 off the coast of the @entity25 province of @entity26 and @entity27 , the tiny islands of @entity18 and @entity19 changed hands frequently between the @entity29 and the @entity21 in the 1700s			1
they finally settled in @entity33 hands after @entity7 's second abdication in 1815			1
with peat bogs , rugged hills and a now struggling fishing industry , the last time the islands made headlines was during the @entity41 era , when they briefly became a hub of alcohol smuggling into the @entity44			2
these days tourism plays a large role in keeping this " department " of @entity21 alive			1
" i remember the ferry ride and the young school children vomiting with seasickness , " says @entity25 travel blogger @entity48 , who traveled there from @entity26 via a one - hour ferry trip			1
" then : stepping onto the pier , the whole downtown area opening up with colorful storefronts , old @entity21 - styled architecture and adorable little @entity2 cars			1
" @entity58 is barely spoken , and @entity2 voltage replaces @entity61 standards			2
" for the 6,300 residents , a hefty $ 65 million subsidy from @entity65 is even more important in enabling civilization here to continue			0
if you make the trip , you can expect a @entity21 - ness that is absolute , from the liqueur stores selling @entity73 and @entity74 to lace curtains and bijou patisseries selling croissants and pastries			1
more information is available from the @entity18 and @entity19 official website			1
@entity81 services the islands from @entity83 's ( @entity26 ) , @entity84 and @entity85 in @entity25			1
@entity86 officially : @entity87 coral reefs , waterfalls , brown tree snakes and a local obsession with @entity92 , @entity86 is the most southerly and largest of the @entity94 located in the western @entity13			0
a major military asset of the @entity44 , there are huge @entity98 and @entity99 installations here and the surrounding oceans are used by the @entity44 military for war game simulations			0
for visitors , many of whom come from @entity107 , there 's plenty to do despite the high troop presence			2
huge underwater coral craters teem with stingrays and are a draw to divers			0
the food is a unique fusion of @entity118 , @entity119 and native @entity117 influences -- spicy dishes featuring tortillas , soy , corn bread and coconut			0
food plays a big role in the fiestas in @entity86 , which take place throughout the year			0
" in the @entity133 , you do n't need to be invited , you can just show up and go to all the different family 's homes holding fiestas , " says @entity130 , who writes the blog iquitmyjobandmovedtoguam.com			1
" one guy [ told me ] , ' you ca n't call yourself an islander until you 've eaten these three things			2
' another said , ' you ca n't ever lose weight in @entity86 and no one is ever skinny			2
' " beaches feature almost blindingly white sands			0
the sheer cliff edge known as @entity152 is a hugely popular wedding venue for tourists ; legend has it that two lovers , forbidden from being together by their parents , threw themselves off the edge into the @entity159			0
more information is available from the official @entity162 website			0
@entity163 flies from @entity164 to @entity86			0
@entity165 and @entity166 fly to @entity86 from @entity167			0
@entity168 officially : self - governing state in free association with @entity171 you ca n't get much more remote than @entity168 ( pronounced new - way ) , gloriously isolated in the @entity13 , some 1,500 miles to the northeast of @entity171			2
this tiny coral reef ( known as a " maketa " island ) is home to barely 1,500 people , just a fraction of the total number of @entity168 , many of whom have migrated to @entity171 , with whom it operates in " free association			0
" this means , in a slightly different arrangement to an overseas territory , @entity171 , under the island 's constitution , must provide " necessary economic and administrative assistance " to @entity168			1
the underwater chasms , ravines and gullies here make for great scuba diving			0
humpback whales often pass by and , despite the lack of beach ( the oval - shaped island rises sharply out of the ocean ) , there 's still a handful of restaurants and bars overlooking the vast @entity13 that serve @entity206 specialties including coconut crab , breadfruit , cassava and shellfish			2
" there are only 100 rooms for accommodation on the island , and estimates say that @entity168 only sees about 2,000 tourists a year , " says travel blogger @entity211 , who visited in 2009			0
" this creates a completely unique atmosphere on the island -- locals know tourism is important for their economy , yet the tourism numbers are still small enough that the locals are genuinely happy to see travelers			0
" it is far and away the most friendly place i have ever been			0
" more information is available from the @entity233 website			0
@entity234 flies to @entity168 from @entity235 twice a week			0
@entity236 officially : @entity237 a source of near constant friction between @entity29 and @entity118 , the tiny enclave of @entity236 on @entity118 's far southern coast was granted to the @entity29 in the @entity241 in 1713 -- it remains the only overseas territory @entity29 possesses in @entity2			1
for @entity244 , it 's by far the easiest of all the remaining @entity29 overseas territories to visit -- even budget airlines fly here from @entity248 )			1
the formerly vital naval base ( it 's now a hub of offshore finance ) is home to nearly 30,000 @entity29 subjects			1
if the retro pubs serving full fried @entity58 breakfasts in the soaring @entity259 heat do n't appeal , there 's plenty to explore on the colossal @entity261			1
it 's inhabited by a huge population of barbary macaque monkeys and miles of tunnels on and in the @entity266 , dug out during the 19th century by locals to protect the territory during a siege by the @entity21 and @entity118 , who were trying to wrestle it out of @entity29 hands			1
despite the tensions , @entity236 's place on the world sporting stage got a boost in 2013 when its team was admitted to @entity2 's governing football body @entity278			2
this means that , as the continent 's smallest competing team , @entity236 will be in the hunt to qualify for the 2016 @entity283 in @entity21			1
more information is available at the official @entity286 website			0
@entity287 flies to @entity236 from @entity288			0
@entity289 officially : special municipality of the @entity291 ferns , elfin forests , tropical flowers and mahogany trees , @entity289 is one of the quietest and least visited islands in the @entity12			2
it 's one of three @entity12 islands administered as " special municipalities " of @entity300 from the @entity301			1
along with @entity302 and @entity303 , @entity289 draws a small yet committed bunch of visitors who come for the diving amid coral reefs teeming with groupers , turtles and the odd shark			0
by law , all the houses the 1,500 locals reside in are painted white with red roofs and green shutters			0
goats outnumber people by 10 to one , though you 'll need more than a little goat - like stubbornness to climb the 1,064 concrete steps that lead to the summit of @entity324			0
the name is n't a misnomer -- the steps pass through rainforest bulging with mountain palms and elephant ear ferns and the view from the top on a clear day is sublime			2
better still , the only company you 're likely to be sharing the view with are hummingbirds , iguanas and the odd ( harmless ) racer snake			2
more information is available from the official @entity339 website			0
@entity340 flies from @entity341 to @entity289 daily			0
the flight takes just 12 minutes			0
@entity343 officially : @entity237 forget what the people of the @entity346 tell you , this is the most remote inhabited place on the entire planet -- a volcanic island in the @entity14 1,750 miles from the nearest populated place , @entity352 , @entity353			1
the reasons for the 260 @entity29 subjects ( who share six surnames between them ) residence here are bizarre			1
when @entity7 was exiled to @entity362 ( another @entity29 territory in the @entity14 ) a small band of @entity29 soldiers was stationed on @entity343 to prevent the island being used as part of any escape attempt			1
their descendants now comprise the population , which was evacuated to southern @entity369 in 1961 after the volcano erupted			2
they returned the next year , preferring their island to city life			0
" @entity343 is definitely not the most exotic island to travel to , but if you want to escape the chaos of the big city and experience life in a small , friendly community , you probably wo n't find a better place , " writes @entity373 , who blogs for @entity374			1
the chances of the diminutive tyrant fleeing via here back to @entity21 were always pretty remote -- @entity343 is thousands of miles in the wrong direction from @entity65			1
today , the main industry is the export of crayfish			2
there are no hotels , no airstrips , just one pub ( the @entity395 ) and , if you want to get here , you 'll have to either snag a place on the few @entity353 fishing vessels that pass by or book a berth on the @entity401 , @entity29 's last post boat , which delivers mail to the locals			1
for more information visit @entity343			1
for details on the schedule of the @entity401 and other vessels that visit check out this official @entity343 website			1
@entity411 is a freelance journalist and radio presenter based in @entity413 , @entity248 , with more than 10 years experience writing and talking about travel , lifestyle , food , music , books and disability affairs .			0

colonies are n't as common as they used to be , but several overseas territories remain , and they 're worth a visit
you can get to @entity21 with an hour 's ferry ride from @entity25 to the islands of @entity18 and @entity429
@entity29 's @entity343 in the @entity14 has a population of just 260 , and specializes in exporting crayfish
