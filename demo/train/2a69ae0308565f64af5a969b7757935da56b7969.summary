@entity0 -- as @entity3 candidates attack one another on the campaign trail , @entity3 outside spending groups are taking aim at president @entity8 over failed energy company @entity9			1
given such easy targets as the poor state of the economy and mortgage foreclosures , why take aim at @entity8 on @entity9 ? both parties view @entity8 's ethical standards and his personal likability among his greatest strengths with voters , and deep - pocketed @entity3 groups want to change that image			1
they see @entity9 as a way to erode the president 's brand as ethical and honest			1
since the fall , two @entity3 outside spending groups have collectively spent $ 9.4 million on four ads attacking @entity8 for his administration 's $ 535 million loan to @entity9			1
the ads accuse the president of being part of " typical @entity0 " and engaged in " politics as usual			1
" the latest assault , a 30 - second spot by @entity38 - advised @entity37 , says the @entity8 " gave his political backers billions			2
" at first look , the ads seem to challenge the president over spending and the role that government should play in the economy			2
but they also make a more emotional appeal , attempting to imprint in voters ' minds that the @entity8 of 2012 is not the same candidate who ran in 2008 on the promise to " drain the swamp " in @entity0			1
put simply , the ads seek to undermine the perception that @entity8 is an ethical politician			1
@entity57 , president of @entity58 , which spent $ 8.4 million airing @entity9 - themed ads , said , " we have a president who proclaimed he was going to be different , and it turns out he is not			1
he is just the same old , same old we 've seen from politicians in both parties over the years			0
" @entity57 said the administration " has not lived up to its own lofty rhetoric " and believes the president " is using tax dollars by the bushel - full to promote his ideology , an ideology that leads to cronyism			0
" former @entity75 gov. @entity74 has picked up on theme , telling a @entity78 , @entity79 , crowd monday : " he practices something i call crony capitalism , and instead of it being driven by the market and consumers , it 's driven by politicians			0
" this strategy is what you 'd call attacking a perceived strength			0
a november @entity91 / @entity90 poll suggested that 57 % of @entity92 believe the president is honest and ethical			2
and operatives on both sides of the aisle acknowledge that @entity8 remains well - liked personally even when his job performance numbers are low			2
some operatives say that could count for a point or two in a close race and could be meaningful in november			0
@entity102 , ceo and president of @entity104 and @entity37 , explained that voters who are still impressionable include independents , " soft " @entity107 and @entity3 who voted for @entity8 in 2008 but now " feel a deep sense of disappointment			1
" @entity102 said his research shows while this group of voters believes the president is " not up to the job , " they 're still " looking for signs of success " and " want to validate their decision " to vote for him			0
at the same time , he says @entity8 " is starting to own part of the @entity0 dysfunction " and these voters " fault ( the president ) for failing to clean up @entity0			1
" that 's where these ads come in			2
" when ( the president ) says he wants to change rules of game to help people , what it looks like is @entity9 , " @entity102 said			0
" it reminds people that his interventions lead to failure and poor results and wasting money			0
" as the president tries to run away from @entity0 , these ads attempt to anchor him in the swamp			2
all this is not lost on the @entity8 campaign			2
the @entity9 ad war prompted the @entity8 team to play defense			0
its first ad of the election was a spot reacting to @entity58 's @entity9 ads , calling them " ads ( that ) fact checkers say are not tethered to the facts			0
" the @entity8 campaign ad continues , " independent watchdogs call this president 's record on ethics unprecedented " and " president @entity8 kept his promise to toughen ethics rules and strengthen @entity92 's energy economy			1
" despite this seemingly defensive posture , @entity107 operatives are adamant the president 's record on ethics -- dating back to his days in the @entity172 -- makes him unshakable on this count and @entity3 groups can throw millions at him without making a dent			1
expect those millions to flow			0
the groups plan to keep their messaging -- they call it " advocacy " -- going			0
together , @entity58 , @entity104 and @entity37 raised more than $ 100 million in 2011 .			0
