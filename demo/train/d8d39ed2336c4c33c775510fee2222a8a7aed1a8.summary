-- news that @entity2 has sunk $ 300 million into a venture with @entity4 sends a clear signal that the computing giant and the bookseller aim to shake up the e-book market with new ammo in their fight against @entity11 and @entity12			1
but whatever impact the move has on sales of @entity4 's @entity17 e-readers now , it 's the future of the partnership that has truly disruptive potential			1
the @entity17 's considerable catalog of books and other content could become more formidable when married with products like @entity2 's forthcoming @entity25 operating system -- which is designed to run on tablet computers -- and even its leading game console , the @entity28			1
" @entity2 has not successfully gotten outside of pcs in any way other than the @entity28 , " said @entity29 , an analyst with @entity30 who studies both e-readers and @entity2 products , including the @entity28			0
" now , if you have the best game console in the world and the highest penetration of a @entity40 operating system in the world and an ok platform for tablets , you really do have an interesting play that @entity2 has stumbled into			1
" early versions of @entity25 have received largely positive reviews			0
several electronics companies are said to be building tablets to run the system			0
and with @entity4 's book offerings cooked into @entity25 , it could put the system in the same league as @entity12 's , which has incorporated @entity56 into virtually all of its products			1
" this is a key way of getting more content on to the @entity2 platform , " @entity58 wrote for @entity59 , " specifically e-books content to ensure that its @entity25 tablets will be able to compete not only against the best - selling @entity65 but also the @entity66 from @entity11 , along with the rest of the company 's e-readers			1
" according to monday 's announcement , @entity2 's $ 300 million is buying a 17.6 % stake in @entity4 's nook products and books , which are being split off from the company 's brick - and - mortar stores			1
currently , @entity11 has more than 60 % of both the e-book and e-reader market , @entity29 said			2
estimates suggest that @entity11 , which tends to be stingy with announcing its sales figures , has sold more than 20 million kindles , including at least 6 million @entity66 tablets			2
@entity29 says the @entity17 has probably tallied less than half that			0
a @entity4 representative declined monday to comment on sales figures , saying only that the company has sold " millions " of @entity17			2
" what 's happening right now is , @entity11 is walking away with that business , because @entity11 already has the book buyer at a critical point : their website , " @entity29 said			2
" @entity11 has almost a chokehold			0
... the only way to get around that is if you happen to be a @entity4 customer or you 're in the @entity4 store			0
" what a merging of @entity17 products and the new @entity25 operating system could do , he said , is " try to get you before you even go to @entity11			1
" the @entity2 deal might not have a huge impact on sales of current devices , according to @entity29			0
but it sets the table for a future in which a nook tablet , running @entity109 8 , could marry content from pcs with content from the @entity28 game console and other devices			0
adding at least one tablet to its @entity116 ( @entity29 predicts multiple devices with different - sized screens ) would put @entity4 more on par with @entity11 , which has had more success with its $ 199 @entity66 than any other would - be competitor to @entity12 's @entity65			1
@entity123 says the @entity66 is the top - selling tablet running @entity127 's @entity126 operating system , with more than 54 % of that market in the @entity129 the second - place device , the @entity122 , comes in at about 15 %			2
whether a @entity133 combo could have similar success , of course , remains an open question			0
" clearly , " @entity29 said , " this is just a first step			0

@entity2 's *investment* in the @entity17 *expands* *options* for @entity4 e-books
the @entity25 operating system could benefit from the @entity17 's catalog
currently , @entity11 *dominates* the e-reader and e-book marketplace
@entity2 spent $ 300 million for 17.6 % of @entity4 's e-book business
