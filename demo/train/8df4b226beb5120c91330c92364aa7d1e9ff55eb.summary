-- the 19 " hotshot " firefighters killed in @entity2 on june 30 were trained to get close to a blaze , dig barriers and clear out the brush that otherwise would fuel it			1
but a sudden shift in the @entity10 's direction trapped the group			1
the deaths are under investigation , but officials have said it appears the 19 were forced to lie down under blankets meant to protect against flames and heat as a last resort against an inferno that overwhelmed them			1
just one member of the elite 20 - man wildfire - fighting crew survived			2
it was the deadliest day for @entity26 firefighters since the 9/11 attacks			2
now the firefighters ' families -- many with small children -- must figure out how to cope , as they mourn their losses			1
there are organizations that assist the families of lost firefighters , and several are already mobilized for the families of the @entity38 , @entity2 - based crew			1
@entity39 is the executive director of one such group , the @entity41			2
" in general , needs end up being the same for fallen firefighters , no matter where it is in the country			2
the immediate needs are going to be some financial support to help them deal with costs associated with the death			2
oftentimes the firefighter is the main breadwinner in the household , so you 've got to worry about food on the table , shoes for the kids and those kinds of things , " @entity39 says			0
the foundation also helps with the necessary paperwork for each family as well as providing emotional support			0
" we use survivors from other line - of - duty death incidents to be in our survivor support network , and we kind of match survivors up from previous events with the new families , so they have somebody to talk to			1
sometimes they just need somebody who understands what they 're going through , " explains @entity39 , who was a firefighter in @entity73 , @entity74 , for 24 years			0
@entity39 's group also helps the children of fallen firefighters cope with their loss , because they often do n't understand the spotlight such an event puts them under			1
there are also long - term needs for the entire family to help rebuild their lives			1
the foundation holds conferences to teach life skills and financial planning			0
@entity39 says the 19 firefighters lost in @entity2 were a special breed -- like many others who choose to be firefighters			1
" the fire service is a very dangerous profession , whether you 're career or volunteer , wildlands or industrial or even military firefighters			1
we understand the risks to being a firefighter and we accept those			0
and we try to do everything humanly possible to prevent tragic occurrences , but unfortunately they do occur			0
and so our families kind of know that			0
" " and so there is a bonding effect within the fire service , " @entity39 continues			0
" there is that fire service family			0
and i think the uniqueness of that is we function as a team			0
a fire crew , you know , they live together , sleep together , eat together , laugh together , go home to their families , but when they 're at work , there 's a secondary family			0
and both of those have very special unique bonds			0
" additional groups also offering support to the families of the @entity38 hotshots are : @entity137 's charities @entity138 of @entity2 @entity139			1

the memorial service for 19 firefighters who died in @entity2 is on july 9
the hotshot firefighters left behind families who need help now
several organizations are on the ground in @entity38 helping these families cope
head of one support group says the help these families need will be long - term
