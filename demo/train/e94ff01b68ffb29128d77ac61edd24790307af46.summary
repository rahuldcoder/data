@entity0 , @entity1 -- i 've spent most of my adult life -- over three decades -- in @entity1			1
to some degree , it has been like @entity8 itself , a shelter from the @entity12 storm : leafy mountains , red barns and white clapboard houses , quiet dirt roads with covered bridges , village greens , lots of fresh organic food , ex-hippies galore and the open waters of @entity23 , which treads a narrow path over 100 miles between the @entity25 to the east and the @entity27 to the west			1
the county where i live -- @entity30 -- has refused to let in the big box stores , such as @entity32 and @entity33 we prefer our country stores , where you can buy anything from maple syrup and cheddar cheese to nails or diapers for a baby			2
@entity43 , a socialist , is one of our two senators			2
we were the first state to allow civil unions			0
soon , a single - payer health care system will be put into place -- a bold experiment that might show the rest of the country how to do such a thing			0
rumor has it that the number of cows in @entity1 exceeds the number of people			1
and we do n't get many hurricanes or tropical storms up here			0
they have n't been words in our local vocabulary			0
the problems with weather usually come in the dead of winter , and they involve large quantities of ice , which gather on the birch trees and bend them to the ground			1
i sometimes have to head to the nearby college where i teach -- a three - mile journey -- on cross-country skis			0
and that 's a satisfying mode of transportation			0
but as everyone knows by now , we just got hit by @entity80 , with devastating results -- especially on the eastern side of the @entity25			1
more than 200 roads were closed at one point , with stretches washed out by flooding streams			2
the lovely town of @entity88 , once the home of @entity90 , was deep under water , and people are still trying desperately to clear away the mess			1
one famous old covered bridge is gone -- a pity , as we have the highest concentration of covered bridges anywhere in the @entity12 , and it 's always a shame to lose one			1
even where i live , on an old farm outside of @entity0 , on the western side of the state , we had winds that tore up trees by the roots			2
branches still litter the ground around my 150 - year - old house , and several shingles were blown from the roof			0
the @entity113 , which runs nearby , is dangerously swollen still , reminding me of that great line in @entity115 : " the river is a strong brown god			0
" i 've never seen the river this color before : deep brown			2
my youngest son , a feisty teenager , just asked me if he could swim in the creek			0
i told him about the people swept downriver only two days ago , one of them still missing			0
what is weird is how bright and calm the weather has become , leaving behind so much destruction , stirring up stories that will probably linger by the fireside for decades			1
the sky is suddenly clear as gin			0
there is no wind , just the aftermath of nature 's wrath			0
i feel a sense of awe , thinking of @entity80 , how it moved through us on a dark sunday , churning through the night , turning the field beside my house into a pond			1
now it has left us -- thank @entity145 -- having taken its nastiness elsewhere			2
it has left @entity1 to pick up the pieces one by one , like @entity150 , having to deal with the fact that a snake came through the garden			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			1

@entity156 : @entity1 a haven of mountains , red barns , clapboard houses , covered bridges
bad weather comes in winter , he says , with ice bending trees and snow blocking roads
now , @entity88 deep under water , *ruined* covered bridges and homes , @entity156 says
@entity156 : *vermonters* left to clean up in the calm , bright weather @entity80 left behind
