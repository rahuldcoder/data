@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity10 , the website that released secret video of a @entity14 airstrike in @entity15 that killed a dozen civilians , is " getting an enormous quantity of whistle - blower disclosures of high caliber , " the site 's founder , @entity3 , said friday in a rare public appearance here			1
speaking at the @entity18 conference , @entity3 said that " we are overwhelmed by our growth " and the site ca n't keep up with the volume of the new material because it does n't have enough people to verify it			2
he later told reporters that " there are many things which are very explosive			0
" @entity3 said the organization gets material from whistle - blowers in a variety of ways -- including via postal mail -- vets it , releases it to the public and then defends itself against " the regular political or legal attack			1
" he said the organization rarely knows the identity of the source of the leak			0
" if we find out at some stage , we destroy that information as soon as possible , " he said			0
@entity46 , 22 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , has been charged with eight violations of the @entity14 @entity50 for allegedly illegally transferring classified data , including the video that wound up on @entity10			1
he has been accused of " wrongfully introducing a classified video of a military operation filmed at or near @entity55 , @entity15 " around july 12 , 2007 , " onto his personal computer , a non-secure information system			0
" @entity3 said at a news conference that @entity46 " is a political prisoner being held in the nation of @entity62 , effectively keeping him away from the press and effective legal representation			1
" he said @entity10 is providing legal assistance to @entity46 without saying if he was the source of the video			1
" obviously , we can not pick and choose , " said @entity3 , adding that the site has to defend everyone who faces serious charges as a result of material posted on @entity10			1
the video shows aerial footage of an attack by a @entity14 @entity79 helicopter that killed civilians , including two journalists from the @entity83 news service			2
@entity10 posted it in april			2
the site said the video " clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded @entity83 employee and his rescuers			0
" asked to respond to @entity3 's assertion that @entity46 is a " political prisoner , " @entity91 spokesman col. @entity90 told @entity2 that @entity46 is " accused of committing serious offenses			1
he has been charged under the @entity95 and will be processed by normal procedures through the military justice system			0
" @entity14 military authorities have warned that the publication of classified documents on @entity10 could aid in the planning of terrorist attacks and harm national security			1
at the @entity1 event , @entity3 said , " remember the people in @entity55 , the people in @entity15 , the people in @entity106 , they do n't need to see the video			2
they see it every day			0
" he said the site 's hope is that such video " will change the perception of the people who are paying " for the war			0
@entity3 denied reports that @entity10 had received hundreds of thousands of classified @entity14 cables in addition to the @entity15 video			1
he said the site would have released the cables if it had received them			0
@entity3 said some information , including a patient 's medical records , should legitimately be kept secret			2
but he said @entity10 's practice of revealing information from whistle - blowers follows the traditions of journalism			1
the fact that governments and organizations spend money to keep this information secret , @entity3 said , is a good indication that releasing the information can achieve reform			2
the 39 - year - old @entity3 , who has gray hair swept back behind his ears , noted that @entity10 operates in several countries , including @entity141 and @entity142 , where , he said , laws give protection to the disclosures made on the site			1
he said he had to cancel three public appearances in the @entity14 , including one at the june conference of @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152 , because of " unreasonable " statements by @entity14 officials in private that they " may not follow the rule of law " in dealing with him			2
" i received advice from figures like [ investigative reporter ] @entity160 to exercise caution , " @entity3 said , adding that @entity14 officials have now adopted a " reasonable " attitude in private			1
@entity3 was interviewed by @entity162 , curator of @entity18 , the nonprofit that ran the conference			0
he asked the audience for a show of hands as to whether he was a hero or a " dangerous troublemaker			0
" the vast majority signaled that they viewed him as a hero			0
@entity2 's @entity171 and @entity172 contributed to this report .			0
