-- @entity1 was founded a half - century ago in a @entity3 garage			1
the @entity6 family 's commitment to quality is driven in large part by their @entity10 faith , which in turn may soon threaten the company 's very existence			1
that financial and constitutional dynamic is now before the @entity17 @entity16 , in a high - stakes encore to the health care reform law known as @entity20			1
the justices will issue their ruling monday in a dispute involving contraception coverage and religious liberty			2
" our religion is mennonite ; that is our faith			0
our company was founded on that religion as well , " said @entity1 's president @entity6 , son of the privately held company 's co-founder			1
" we feel the government has gone too far in too many instances			1
it 's been troubling to us as a family			1
" the modest furniture maker 's pending lawsuit is one of nearly 50 that have been filed in federal courts from various corporations , challenging the birth - control coverage benefits in the law championed by president @entity45			1
that law has come in for separate , fierce political criticism over its rocky public introduction last fall			0
the court will review provisions in the @entity20 requiring for - profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay			1
at issue is whether certain companies can refuse to do so on the sincere claim it would violate their owners ' long - established personal beliefs			2
the justices ' decision could clarify whether businesses have a religious liberty right , or whether such constitutional protections apply only to individuals			0
a companion legal challenge comes from @entity68 , an @entity69 - based retail giant that will have more than 700 arts and crafts stores nationwide by year 's end			1
both corporations emphasize their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace			0
that includes their leaders ' publicly stated opposition to abortion			0
the @entity16 held oral arguments in the two cases in late march			0
under the @entity20 , financial penalties of up to $ 100 per day , per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage			1
" the fines and implications are , in my mind , astronomical , " said @entity6 , who employs about 1,000 people			0
" it 's devastating to any company			1
" @entity68 , which has about 13,000 workers , estimates the penalty could cost it $ 475 million a year			0
the church - state issue now in the spotlight involves three - pronged rules negotiated last year between the @entity45 administration and various outside groups			2
under the changes , churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate			0
other nonprofit , religiously affiliated groups , such as church - run hospitals , parochial schools and charities such as the @entity111 , must either offer coverage , or have a third - party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer 's direct involvement			1
lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts across the country			0
the @entity68 and @entity1 claims are in yet another @entity20 category : for - profit corporations claiming a religion - based exemption			1
these suits follow the high court 's decision two years ago that narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law , a blockbuster ruling affirming that most @entity17 would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty , the so - called individual mandate			1
the constitutional debate now shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same first amendment rights as individuals			0
three federal appeals courts around the country have struck down the contraception coverage rule , while two other appeals courts have upheld it			2
that " circuit split " made the upcoming @entity16 review almost certain			0
@entity147 and his family are @entity68 's owners and say their evangelical @entity10 beliefs clash with parts of the law 's mandates for comprehensive coverage			1
they say some of the drugs that would be provided prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman 's womb , which the @entity160 equate with abortion			2
those drugs include @entity164 contraception , which some have called the " morning after " pill			0
the large retailer says it already provides coverage for 16 federally approved forms of contraception -- such as condoms and diaphragms -- for its roughly 13,000 employees , who @entity68 says represent a variety of faiths			1
@entity68 is well known for giving to a variety of charities , for closing its stores every sunday , and proudly offering @entity179 , @entity180 , and other @entity10 - themed products			2
both the @entity160 and @entity182 sat together in the courtroom for the march arguments , offering little visible reaction to dense questioning aimed at lawyers appearing before the bench			0
the @entity189 has said it believes a requirement on contraception coverage is " lawful and essential to women 's health " and expressed confidence the @entity16 would ultimately agree			1
@entity20 's supporters say it does not require individual company owners to personally provide coverage they might object to but instead places that responsibility on the corporate entity			1
" throughout our nation 's history , corporations have been treated differently than individuals when it comes to fundamental , personal rights of conscience and human dignity , " said lawyers for the @entity201 , a progressive public - interest legal group			1
" @entity212 's free exercise guarantee has always been viewed as a purely personal liberty			2
" but lawyers representing the @entity182 say they deserve freedom from what they call state intrusion into private moral decisions			0
" the question in this case is whether all @entity17 will have religious freedom and will be able to live and do business according to their faith , " said @entity219 , senior legal counsel with the @entity221			0
" or whether the federal government can pick and choose what faith is , who are the faithful , and where and when they can exercise that faith			2
" a key issue for the justices will be interpreting a 1993 federal law known as the @entity236 , requiring the government to seek the " least burdensome " and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions			2
can companies , churches , and universities be included , or do the protections apply only to " persons ? " as for @entity1 , @entity6 and his wife , @entity246 , believe they are on the right side of the legal and moral argument			1
they live in @entity251 with their four children , just down the street from their second - generation kitchen cabinet business , which has expanded over the years , with plants in two other states			2
nearby are @entity6 's two brothers -- who also work at the company -- and his parents , @entity260 and @entity261			1
@entity260 and his brother @entity262 formed the business fifty years ago , almost on a whim			0
as the family tells it , a local builder essentially dared the men , who were local craftsmen , to install a kitchen in one day			0
they did , and the builder kept his word and gave the @entity182 all of his business			0
their once - local clientele has now gone global			0
" it 's really not only just for @entity1			1
we 're taking a stand for other businesses as well , " said @entity6 about his appeal			0
" this is a religious liberty issue that is concerning to us			0
" court set to rule on @entity20 contraception mandate 5 questions : @entity16 and @entity20 on contraception opinion : how @entity20 can reduce abortions @entity68 : the beliefs behind the battle			2

a @entity292 company challenged a requirement in @entity20
the requirement invoves birth - control coverage benefits for employees
the family - owned @entity1 firm opposes having to do that
" we feel the government has gone too far in too many instances , " says the firm 's president
