-- just weeks before @entity2 sgt. @entity1 walked off base and into @entity5 hands , a @entity7 filmmaker caught on video scenes that would come to define his unit as an unruly , undisciplined bunch			1
the video , published by the @entity7 newspaper @entity12 , showed some soldiers breaking @entity2 rules by not wearing helmets while in the field			1
filmmaker @entity17 filmed @entity1 and his platoon in 2009 as they built a fortified bunker near several villages in the @entity23 province of @entity24			1
one of @entity1 's fellow soldiers can be heard sympathizing with @entity24 villagers in the video			2
" they ( @entity24 ) got ( messed ) with from the @entity28 for 17 years , and then now we 're here			0
i 'd gladly leave them alone , " the soldier says			0
an @entity2 source tells @entity0 discipline in the platoon was " lax			1
" a sergeant was demoted and two other sergeants were re-assigned after the pictures became public , according to a 2012 @entity39 article			0
@entity1 's former team leader , sgt. @entity40 , said the footage was blown out of proportion			2
" there were some people who were really angry that soldiers were n't wearing their protective equipment out in the field			0
it was something that got exaggerated way bigger than it should have , " @entity40 told @entity0 , adding that soldiers were disciplined			0
a @entity53 official who has been briefed on the initial @entity2 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after @entity1 disappeared told @entity0 that some of @entity1 's teammates said he had expressed " boredom " and thought his unit was too passive and should have been " kicking down doors , " the official said			1
a former lieutenant colonel who advised officials investigating @entity1 's disappearance said that while some of the unit 's commanders did not have their act together , their behavior does not explain why @entity1 left his platoon			1
" there 's nothing going on here that could justify in my mind or justify in anyone that i 've talked to about this that would allow for or explain @entity1 simply walking away and abandoning his post , " retired @entity2 lt. col. @entity69 said			2
while investigators continue to speculate about motivations , one common theme has emerged -- @entity1 walked away			0
@entity0 's @entity81 contributed to this report .			0
