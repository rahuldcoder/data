-- he 's won six medals in the @entity3 , including a gold in 2008 , and a bronze just a few months ago in @entity6			0
@entity8 's methods , however , have never been orthodox			1
" i never really worked very goal - oriented , " he admits			0
" i think i 've had some great results and i 've had a long career , so , i mean , i 'm happy about that			0
but i did n't really ever have goals , the way that most people did			0
" @entity8 has always intrigued media and fans alike			1
an unconventional upbringing in a @entity19 log cabin with no electricity or running water gave way to a skiing career in which , for @entity8 , his natural talent and love of the sport always won out over , well , winning			1
indeed , his goal , as stated in his book " @entity8 : go fast , be good , @entity29 " was to ski " as fast as the natural universe would allow			1
" back home after an emotional olympics in @entity6 , where @entity8 cried during a live interview with @entity34 's @entity33 when asked about the recent death of his brother , @entity8 is focusing on another project : his @entity39			1
@entity8 began the foundation after close friend @entity41 suffered a traumatic injury that left him paralyzed from the chest down			1
" i was trying to help him get re-involved in sports			0
he was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting , which is a really tough process when you 're injured like that , " says @entity8			1
" just to watch him go through that i saw how hard it was and how little support there was for him			0
" the experience motivated @entity8 to find ways to help get disabled and injured athletes more involved in sports			1
" we provide the sporting equipment for them and the environment that allows them to participate in whatever sport that is , " @entity8 explains			2
@entity41 serves as director of equipment development for @entity39 , and @entity8 has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports			1
a major annual event for @entity39 is @entity73 , an all - day ski and barbecue extravaganza on @entity8 's home turf of @entity77 , @entity19 , complete with autographs , an auction and a chance for children to race their idol			1
watching @entity8 hurtle down the mountain , swarmed by a speeding army of tiny " @entity86 , " it 's a wonder and a testament to his skills that the whole thing does n't end in a giant human snowball			2
" all the kids want to try and get on the lift with me for at least one run and there 's 400 kids or so			0
it turns into a bit of pandemonium on the way down , " @entity8 says			2
not only is bodefest a fundraiser , but it 's also an opportunity for adaptive athletes to try some of the new equipment on the late - season snow			2
" the program 's really just changed my life , " says adaptive skier @entity102 , who has a condition that affects the muscles in his lower legs			0
" i never thought that i 'd be able to ski even though i 'm in a wheelchair -- or bike -- but this program 's really changed my opinion on adaptive sports			0
" " the key is empowering , " says @entity8			2
" when we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life - changing that can be for them , i think it 's really -- it 's pretty incredible			0
" the sentiment seems to fit with @entity8 's general philosophy of focusing on how the sport makes you feel , rather than the end game , a feeling he believes everyone is entitled to , regardless of ability			2
it may not be competition , but it is a goal he can take into retirement -- and still win .			0
