-- @entity2 capt. @entity1 perhaps put it best			0
he said @entity3 , @entity4 , was unknown to most of the world before august 9			1
that 's the day @entity7 , a white police officer , shot and killed @entity8 , an unarmed black teen			1
the shooting prompted protests in the suburb of @entity12 , making it a flash point in the debate over race and policing in @entity17			1
suddenly , @entity3 had a place on the map			0
" it has become a conversation throughout the world , " said @entity1			0
complete coverage of the events in @entity3 here 's a look at key moments from that conversation : august 9 : the shooting there are conflicting accounts as to exactly what happened the day of the shooting			1
certain facts of the case , however , are clear : @entity7 shot and killed @entity8 on august 9			1
ongoing : the protests and response @entity8 's death sent immediate shock waves through the community of @entity3			1
protests began the same day , and grew as time passed and news of the shooting spread			2
the vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful			0
however , there were pockets of looting and violence , which prompted a forceful -- protesters say excessive -- response from law enforcement			0
authorities , who drove armored vehicles and wore military gear , were roundly criticized by members of the media , other law enforcement officials and demonstrators for escalating the violence , rather than tempering it			2
august 14 : the shift in security in a bid to turn the tide , gov. @entity64 put the @entity2 , and specifically @entity1 , in charge of security			2
@entity64 said he decided to tap state troopers because " at this particular point , the attitudes were n't improving , and the blocks towards expression appeared to be a flash point			0
" @entity3 has looked " more like a war zone , and it 's not acceptable , " the governor said			0
@entity1 promised to take a different , more inclusive approach			0
he walked with protesters and was initially welcomed with open arms			0
some of that good will soured after security forces under his command lobbed tear gas and stun grenades at rowdy protesters , who tossed rocks and @entity89 cocktails at them			0
august 15 : the release of surveillance video and the officer 's name at the start , one of the protesters ' main demands was that the name of the officer involved in the shooting be made public			1
police eventually identified @entity7 as the officer responsible			1
they did so the same day they released surveillance video of @entity8 at @entity107 and liquor store			1
minutes before the teen was shot , police said , a man fitting @entity8 's description allegedly stole cigars and roughed up a store clerk as cameras recorded			1
release of the video angered some , who said police were using it to distract from @entity8 's killing and paint him in a negative light			1
authorities have said @entity7 stopped @entity8 not because of the theft , but because @entity8 and a friend were " walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic			2
" august 15 : the officer 's reported account the officer who killed @entity8 said the teenager rushed at him full speed in the moments before the shooting , according to an account phoned in to a @entity12 radio station and confirmed by a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation			1
according to the version on @entity140 , phoned in by a woman who identified herself as " @entity142 , " the altercation began after @entity7 rolled down his window to tell @entity8 and a friend to stop walking in the street			2
when @entity7 tried to get out of his cruiser , @entity8 first tried to push the officer back into the car , then punched him in the face and grabbed for his gun before breaking free after the gun went off once , the caller said			1
@entity7 pursued @entity8 and his friend , ordering them to freeze , according to the account			2
when they turned around , @entity8 began taunting @entity7 , saying he would not arrest them , then ran at the officer at full speed , the caller said			1
the final shot was to @entity8 's forehead , and the teenager fell two or three feet in front of @entity7 , said the caller , who identified herself as the officer 's friend			1
august 20 : the attorney general 's visit to @entity3 federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations , one into @entity8 's killing and the other into the local police department 's overall track record with minorities			1
the most high - profile figure in president @entity179 's administration to visit @entity3 , @entity17 attorney general @entity180 , stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for @entity7 's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy - handed police response , and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd			2
" the people of @entity3 can have confidence in the federal agents , investigators and prosecutors who are leading the process , " @entity180 said			2
" our investigation will be fair , it will be thorough and it will be independent			0
" " on a personal note , " the @entity204 - @entity17 father of a teenage son told reporters , " i 've seen a lot in my time as attorney general , but few things have affected me as greatly as my visit to @entity3			0
" september 25 : the @entity212 's apology @entity3 police chief @entity213 issued a video apology to @entity8 's parents , as well as to any peaceful protesters who felt he did n't do " enough to protect their constitutional right to protest			1
" specifically , he apologized that it took investigating officers four hours to remove @entity8 's body from the street after @entity7 shot him			1
" i 'm truly sorry for the loss of your son			0
i 'm also sorry that it took so long to remove @entity8 from the street , " he said			2
later , @entity213 said he had no intention of stepping down , despite many calls to do so , telling @entity0 , " this is mine , and i 'm taking ownership of it			0
" october 21 : the autopsy @entity8 's gunshot wounds included a shot in the hand at close range , his official autopsy shows , according to an analysis reported by the @entity242 newspaper			1
a county official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity0 the autopsy document that the @entity242 used to do its report is authentic			0
the detail could lend credence to @entity7 's account that he and the unarmed @entity204 - @entity17 teenager scuffled at his patrol car before @entity8 was shot and killed			1
a private autopsy conducted for the @entity8 family showed the teen had been shot at least six times , including twice in the head			1
the official autopsy , as published by the @entity242 , said @entity8 suffered six gunshot entrance wounds			2
@entity260 : the leaks in the case many details about the investigation have been leaked to the media and some , including attorney general holder , have accused the leakers of being selective			0
in addition to the autopsy information , the @entity242 published accounts of testimony presented to a @entity273 grand jury			1
the @entity274 , meanwhile , reported that at least six black witnesses gave testimony that supported @entity7 's side of the story			2
the @entity279 said it received information from a federal source			0
@entity180 has called the leaks " inappropriate and troubling " because both the federal investigation and the grand jury proceedings are ongoing , according to a justice official			1
ongoing : the grand jury although the grand jury has until january to issue its ruling , the prosecutor 's office has said a decision could come as early as mid-november			1
whether or not it decides to indict @entity7 , authorities have said they are planning for protests and possible violence			2
police from various departments will operate as a unified command			0
the @entity298 will be available as necessary			0
law enforcement is prepared to extend shifts and limit leave , and additional resources have been distributed , gov. @entity64 has said			0
" these measures are not being taken because we are convinced that violence will occur , but because we have a responsibility to prepare for any contingency , " said the governor			0
he added : " this is @entity17			0
people have a right to express their views and grievances , but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk			0
" @entity0 's @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 and @entity323 contributed to this report .			0
