@entity0 -- the recently leaked memo from departing chief @entity4 corruption investigator , @entity5 , to @entity6 ban ki - moon will make it impossible for the @entity7 to support the @entity4 chief 's candidacy for a second four - year term next year			1
that is , unless the @entity14 administration itself was only joking when it promised to push for greater transparency and accountability at the @entity4			1
in a 50 - page " end - of - mission " report , the widely respected former auditor of @entity19 -- who was originally brought in to help the @entity4 fix the spectacular accountability gap exposed during the excruciatingly painful " oil - for - food " scandal -- paints a detailed , well - documented tableau of @entity6 's managerial incompetence			1
in a spectacular break from tradition , @entity27 did what few senior diplomats ever dare to do : she spoke truth to power			0
in her report , @entity27 documents @entity6 's repeated efforts to undermine his own senior officials , including her own office of internal oversight , by stemming the flow of information , interfering in the appointment of staff , or worse , failing to appoint people to senior management positions altogether			1
critical leadership posts were left vacant for as long as possible , thereby strengthening @entity6 's power over the bureaucracy			2
the @entity51 , she concludes , is " in a process of decay ... falling apart ... and drifting into irrelevance			2
" it may be that many member states do not actually want the @entity4 to get in the way of their realpolitik			2
but when it comes to standing for the principles of its charter in difficult , often dangerous mission areas , the @entity4 can not succeed unless its staff are led and supported by a better - managed @entity51 in @entity0			1
as it happens , even their very physical security did not appear to be a priority for the ban ki - moon administration			1
it failed to appoint another under secretary - general for @entity71 for a full 11 months after accepting the resignation of @entity73 , in june 2008 , following the deadly bombing of the @entity4 's @entity76 headquarters			1
@entity6 's failures to perform his duties as the @entity4 's chief administrative officer in a timely manner -- the @entity27 report describes these failures as widespread -- have repercussions all the way down the line on staff security and morale			1
instead of being empowered to do their job , the staff , including @entity27 herself , end up feeling undermined by their boss			0
unless @entity94 and her @entity4 ambassador , @entity95 , are prepared to contradict @entity27 ' assessment , they will have no choice but to withdraw @entity99 's support for @entity6 's re-election ( his term expires at the end of 2011 )			1
unfortunately for @entity6 's administration , few people were better placed than its own auditor to draw such conclusions			2
and she is not alone in her assessment			0
@entity27 has managed the rather undiplomatic feat of saying out loud what a lot of @entity4 officials , including some at the highest levels , have been murmuring for several years			2
while it is not altogether unheard of for former @entity4 bureaucrats to blow their top after they leave office , it is without doubt the first time such a senior official has done so with as much competence , and credibility , as @entity27			0
as a former employee of the @entity4 's " oil - for - food " operation -- the organization 's fraud - ridden $ 64 billion humanitarian operation that saw billions of dollars diverted from needy @entity130 civilians into the pockets of @entity132 and an international clique of corrupt politicians -- i have learned to recognize the elements that go into making large - scale diplomatic fiascos			1
after i had contributed to blowing the whistle on that program in 2004 , some @entity4 officials spent more time trying to discredit my testimony than to fix the cracks in the system that led to the debacle in the first place			0
in fact , she invited me to spend an afternoon conducting a " lessons learned " discussion with her entire senior staff			0
her approach was so markedly different from what i had experienced that i caught myself feeling hopeful , thereafter , about the chances of seeing real management reforms happen after all			0
unfortunately , it would seem @entity27 has become a whistleblower herself			0
if such a senior @entity4 official ca n't seem to communicate her concerns to her boss and is forced into the very uncomfortable position of having to speak out with such force as she did in her latest report , it is difficult to conclude that all is well at the top echelons of the world body			1
if ban ki - moon were well advised , he would not seek a second term in office			1
if he were earnest about pushing for @entity4 reform , he would free himself from the pressure the member states may try to exert upon his office , officially make public those parts of @entity27 's report that do not affect staff security , and dedicate himself to mending the cracks in the system identified by his departing auditor			1
instead , @entity6 left it up to his chief of staff to issue a response which , both in form and substance , does a great job of confirming @entity27 ' criticism			1
in a july 19 letter to @entity195 of the @entity196 , who broke the story , @entity193 says that his boss " is also concerned " that critical senior managerial positions ( now including that of @entity27 ) remain unfilled			0
the problem is , @entity6 's job is not just to " be concerned			0
" it is to actually make appointments -- or " to put butts on seats , " as one @entity99 official once put it to me off the record			0
in this instance , @entity6 ignored the best advice of a 15 - member independent panel and refused to appoint @entity214 , the former @entity215 attorney , to head @entity27 's investigation division			2
in the wake of the oil - for - food meltdown , @entity217 had led an unprecedented exercise in accountability ( so successfully , in fact , that his office was shut down in 2008 )			0
perhaps @entity6 would prefer to appoint someone else who , like he , prefers to show " concern " about the challenges facing the world organization than to take them on -- with deeds , not just words			0
for the @entity4 's own sake , let 's hope the leaders of the world 's democracies can do better than that when it comes to electing a new leader for the @entity4 in 2011			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			0

@entity240 : leaked report shows ban ki - moon not managing @entity4 staff *effectively*
he says @entity99 , other democracies should push to *replace* @entity6 when his term is up
the @entity51 is in danger of becoming irrelevant , the report says
