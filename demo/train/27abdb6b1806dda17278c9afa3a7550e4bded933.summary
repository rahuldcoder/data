-- these days , no fashion house portfolio is complete without a hotel -- or at the very least , a luxuriously designed suite			1
@entity4 and @entity5 are the latest fashion icons to try their hands at hoteling , with @entity4 recently purchasing @entity10 's @entity9 and @entity5 set to open his first branded property in @entity12 ( albeit not until 2017 )			1
they join the ranks of many of the fashion industry 's most iconic members , including @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , and -- until recently -- @entity21 ( the @entity21 brand , alas , is calling it quits )			1
" from a designer 's perspective , a hotel gives you complete latitude to bring their way of thinking to everything , from the draperies to the textures and colors , that 's what you sign up for , " says @entity24 , vice president of equity research in lodging at @entity26			1
in many cases , a hotel acts as a sort of large - scale designer showroom			1
@entity44 , for instance , are outfitted with furnishings from @entity46 , ball gowns accentuate the d√©cor at @entity50 's @entity49 , and no suite at @entity52 is complete without the brand 's signature silver			0
" hotels are a great way to showcase the design identity of a brand , and to project a lifestyle that goes beyond products , " notes @entity55 , the executive vice president of @entity56			2
or , as @entity24 puts it , " the handbag experience has extended itself into a lifestyle experience			0
" hotel brands are just as eager to align themselves with a fashion brand ( even if they do n't hand over the reins completely )			2
when they 're not tapping big - name designers to decorate their suites , hotels are conjuring up fashion - led experiences to entice customers , be it a @entity77 trench coat - loan program or same - day delivery from @entity79			1
" for the consumer , who probably already likes the brand , these experiences are an opportunity to experience it at a higher level ; it helps them bond with brand a little bit more than they would have before , " explains @entity24			2
it also offers the customers a consistency that they might not otherwise expect from a hotel room			2
" when a woman comes to us for a dress , she knows she 's going to look gorgeous and glamorous -- that 's what we do			0
when she stays in our suite , she 'll know the same design levels went into making the space , " notes @entity99 , half of the design label @entity102 , which designed a 1,700 - square foot suite at @entity104			0
branding a hotel suite with a fashion label also helps it attain an extra level of exclusivity			0
@entity56 , for instance , mimics the exclusivity of its design brand by limiting its room count			0
" there 's always a scarcity value attached to these types of offerings , and at no point does a brand want to dilute that , " explains @entity24 .			0
