-- as many as 200,000 state workers in @entity2 could see their pay scale slashed to minimum wage , if orders from the governor 's office are followed			1
in a letter to the state controller thursday , gov. @entity9 's administration ordered the department to reduce the payment of state workers to the hourly rate of $ 7.25 unless a budget is reached soon			1
" these are preparations for the prospect of not having a budget passed this month , " said @entity17 with the @entity18			0
without a budget , the july payroll , sent to go out the end of the month , would be cut , she said			2
" this is not a scare tactic , " she said			1
" this is based on a very real legal requirement			0
" the legal requirement was ordered in 2003 , when the @entity2 @entity29 ruled that the state controller had no legal authority to pay wages in the absence of a budget			1
" his role is to process the payroll that we give him , " @entity17 said			0
but the state controller disagreed			2
" i will not be following the governor 's orders , " @entity40 told @entity0 , calling the governor 's actions dangerous			2
" i do n't understand why we would continue to impose greater hardships upon the good workers here in @entity2 and delay the economic recovery that needs to take place as soon as possible			2
" it 's my responsibility to protect the state 's pocketbook , " @entity40 said , " and even though the governor is trying to fix a budget , he understands that he had that opportunity , he still has that opportunity , and he should not put people in harm 's way			0
" @entity40 said he is willing to work with the governor to come up with a better solution			0
the wage cut directive would not affect state employees who already have a contract , @entity17 said			1
" thirty - seven thousand employees are under a contract that protects them , and the state is currently in negotiations with its largest state employee union , the @entity70 , " she said			1
that union has as many as 95,000 workers , she said			0
if the governor 's order is followed , the pay cut would take effect this month , according to @entity17			1
the workers will get their missed wages once a budget is enacted , she said			0
