@entity0 -- @entity2 -- when @entity4 lifted the @entity5 in 2005 , becoming the first @entity7 team to win a @entity9 trophy , manager @entity3 described it as " a landmark victory for @entity7 football			1
" @entity12 has become @entity7 's first football superstar since the @entity15 era			1
three years later , @entity16 matched the achievement a month before the @entity7 national team reached the semifinals of @entity20			0
after years on the margins , @entity7 football was back in the limelight			1
@entity23 , author of " @entity26 , travels in @entity28 , " told @entity2 that recent successes mark a renaissance of @entity7 football			1
a far - cry from the early years after the collapse of the @entity15 in 1991 , when teams previously funded by state bodies -- such as the police force or the army -- were left chronically short of money			2
@entity23 said that under communist rule @entity35 had been funded by a trade union representing catering workers and were less directly dependant on state support than other @entity7 clubs			1
consequently , when the @entity41 was formed in 1992 , @entity35 found themselves in a better position than many of their rivals and stormed on to win nine of the first 10 titles up for grabs			0
see photos of @entity7 's @entity51 football stars			1
Â» while @entity35 flourished , the rest of the division remained in desperate need of money ; that is , until a new source of funding came in the shape of @entity7 's rising force of oligarchs -- men who had amassed fortunes buying cheap but highly profitable energy companies these oligarchs and energy corporations now play a vital role in funding the game			1
@entity16 is backed by @entity69 , the world 's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas and @entity35 has oil and gas company @entity74 as its primary sponsor			0
@entity4 's 2005 @entity5 triumph was financed by @entity77 , whose majority shareholder at the time was @entity82 owner @entity81 , currently the 51st richest man in the world according to @entity84			0
@entity81 's cash meant the club could afford to sign quality foreign players , including @entity90 internationals @entity88 and the free - scoring @entity91			0
other examples of imported talent includes @entity95 's signing of @entity97 winners @entity98 and @entity99 from @entity100 in 2005 , and @entity16 capturing @entity102 midfielder @entity101 for a reported league record of $ 40 million			0
there are so many foreign players in @entity7 that @entity41 regulations now limit clubs to fielding no more than six foreign players at a time			0
what are your views of @entity7 football ? sound off below			2
but the injection of money into the @entity7 game is n't only useful for buying foreign talent , @entity23 says the national game is also having a revival because of the oligarchs ' money			2
@entity81 funds @entity7 's @entity122 , which , along with providing plastic pitches and coaches for young footballers , is also responsible for paying the wages of national team coach @entity127			2
@entity128 led @entity7 to the semifinals of @entity20 , with the team having never made it past the first round of international competition prior to his appointment in 2006			0
@entity135 , author of " @entity136 " , about the state of @entity7 football , is based in @entity138			2
he told @entity2 that @entity127 's arrival was a turning point in the national team 's fortunes			0
" @entity127 really shook up the national football team			0
he left out some of the veterans and began picking players who were young and fresh , like @entity12 and @entity147 , " he said			2
in @entity12 @entity7 has found its first football superstar since the @entity15 era			1
he signed for @entity1 club @entity150 in february 2009 and has made an instant impact in the @entity152			0
@entity135 says one cloud on the horizon is that @entity7 football 's dependence on energy companies means the global economic crisis and low oil prices could have a negative impact on the sport			1
but if the oligarchs keep supplying the @entity164 , there 's no reason why @entity7 football wo n't continue to blossom .			1

recent @entity5 successes mark a " new era " for @entity7 football
when the @entity15 broke up , @entity7 clubs faced a funding crisis
oligarchs now back many @entity7 teams , bringing money into the game
@entity12 and @entity147 are @entity7 's newest stars
