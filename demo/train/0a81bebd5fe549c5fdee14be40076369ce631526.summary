-- this week 's lesson from " @entity2 " : maybe it 's not the best idea to be on a book tour while dancing in the competition			1
that became the downfall of contestant @entity9 , who was sent home tuesday night after performing a disco - inspired cha - cha earlier in the week			1
although the routine earned the talk show host a 28 , when viewer votes were counted it was @entity9 and @entity16 driver @entity15 who were in danger of going home			1
@entity9 thinks the underwhelming response to his routine had something to do with his lack of practice time			2
he has just released a book on the rev. @entity25 , and that work got in the way of his rehearsals for " @entity2			2
" " this is hard , ( this show is ) so much harder than it looks , " @entity9 told @entity32 's " @entity31 , " " our competitors on the show had 35 to 40 hours a week to rehearse			1
in the midst of a book tour , the most we could do were eight or 10 hours a week			0
you can not perfect the cha - cha in eight or 10 hours ; i do n't care who you are			0
" now we 're down to 11 dancers still sweating it out for the @entity45			0
" @entity47 " star @entity46 was in the lead at the start of the season , but in the second week " @entity55 's " @entity51 took the top of the scoreboard with her jive			1
she earned 35 points , and was trailed closely by " @entity57 " actress @entity58 , whose foxtrot to " @entity60 " earned 34 points			2
although he 's now done with the show , @entity9 said he has no regrets			0
" ( @entity64 ) wanted to do something for himself , " he said			0
" i 'm glad i did it			0

" @entity2 " is down to 11 contestants
week 2 saw @entity9 and @entity15 bringing up the rear
@entity51 and @entity58 were the top points - earners
