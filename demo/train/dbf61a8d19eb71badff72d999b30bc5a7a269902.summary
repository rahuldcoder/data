-- the election of 2012 is a critical juncture in the history of this nation			0
we now have to decide if we love our country enough to do the responsible thing -- rein in out - of - control spending , cut the debt and reform crumbling entitlement programs			0
this will not be easy , but it 's right and what 's necessary for the preservation of our republic			0
rep. @entity17 is the right choice for such a time			1
the president has not led ; @entity21 and @entity17 will lead , and ultimately , they will lead us back on the path to prosperity			1
@entity17 's path to vice presidential nominee is a culmination of decades of outspoken conservatism			1
early on , only a few of his colleagues at @entity32 , a conservative , free - market @entity34 think tank , like @entity36 and me , heard him			0
now , the entire country will hear him			0
the effervescent congressmen from @entity40 , who leads @entity42 in grueling @entity44 workouts most mornings , first emerged onto the national political scene with his roadmap , a first of its kind detailed plan to reform @entity52 's budget , tax code , health care system and @entity55			1
he said what few politicians would say -- @entity52 has overspent , over-promised and under - delivered			1
opinion : is @entity17 for or against @entity60 ? over time this young budget guru , who once told me he relaxes by kicking back with actuarial tables , began to master the @entity52 budget in a way that few ever have			1
he was appointed to be a member of the president 's @entity68 , but , not yielding to political pressure , voted against its recommendations because it failed to adequately reform @entity74			0
so , together with @entity75 ( @entity78 's former @entity77 director ) , @entity17 co-authored the @entity80 plan to seriously reform @entity74 ( although she did n't support the version of it he included in his all - encompassing budget )			1
their plan fell largely on deaf ears , but just because @entity34 was n't listening , @entity17 did n't stop leading			2
he joined forces with sen. @entity88 , @entity89 , to co-author a bipartisan plan to reform @entity74			0
their plan leaves @entity74 intact for existing recipients and those approaching eligibility and offers future enrollees a chance to enroll in the traditional @entity74 government option or enroll in a premium support plan , where seniors can choose from a variety of competitive plans that work best for them			2
during his tenure as @entity104 , @entity17 has penned several of the @entity104 budget plans			1
although his 2012 budget did n't pass the @entity110 - led @entity109 , it garnered far more votes than president @entity113 's budget , and proposed far more serious reforms			2
@entity115 : @entity17 's dangerous vision @entity17 's conservative credentials are unquestionable			2
republicans will never forget how he grilled president @entity113 at the health care summit in 2010			0
but , equally important , if not more , is his record of bipartisan leadership			0
when the time comes and @entity123 demonize @entity74 reform plans , he can hold up @entity88 and @entity78 - era welfare reformers as his defenders			0
more than budget and economic expertise , and he has a lot of it , @entity17 brings to the @entity21 ticket a clear , detailed vision forward for @entity52 , a vision that stretches across party lines			1
@entity17 adds youthful optimism and a dash of @entity36 's infectious charisma to gov. @entity21 's business prowess and management skills			2
for @entity21 this is the bold action many in his party have been waiting for			0
all the cards are now on the table			2
two competing visions of @entity52 's future -- one a nation governed by a large , intrusive caretaker and the other a nation of small government and individual autonomy -- are at stake this november			1
as has been well said about our founding , we are a nation of choice and reflection			0
if the @entity52 people listen to @entity21 and @entity17 and their serious proposals to restore @entity52 prosperity , @entity21 and @entity17 have a chance at winning			1
if the @entity52 people listen to political pandering and ad hominem attacks , they will probably lose			2
@entity21 and @entity17 will now make the case ; the @entity52 people will decide			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			0

@entity167 says choice of @entity17 puts the cards on the table before @entity52
he says @entity17 has dedicated himself to mastering the @entity52 *federal* budget
@entity167 says @entity17 has proposed *innovative* *solutions* and has worked with *democrats*
he says voters will choose between two visions of the size and role of government
