-- since @entity2 took part in the @entity4 in 1984 after a three - decade absence , competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride			1
athletes ' victories on the global stage made us proud of the new @entity2			2
the new " open " @entity2 was full of hopes , dreams and opportunities			2
a strong , united nation working together to build a better tomorrow was the higher calling for all of us			0
to serve this calling , many kids who were identified as potential elite athletes were enrolled into the government supported " sports schools			2
" if they trained hard and were talented enough , they would make it to represent their city , their province and then one day their country			0
when there is a demand , there was also a reward			0
@entity2 @entity4 champions were well rewarded through national and local government , both in terms of compensation and social status			2
@entity36 , the star of the 1984 women 's volleyball team that won a gold medal at the 1984 @entity40 , was the @entity41 of @entity2			2
as the son of a sports reporter , i was fortunate enough to know her when i was a kid			0
the fact that i knew her made me very popular at school , pretty much like telling everybody at school today that @entity50 is your friend			0
in 2008 , @entity2 won 51 gold medals ( 100 medals overall ) and topped the gold medal tally at the @entity55			2
after this astounding success , many started to ask what 's next ? economic growth means that people have more options in terms of career			0
it is more and more difficult to find kids ( and parents ) who want to join the " sports school " system and aim for that one - in - a - million shot to become an @entity4 gold medalist			1
academic performance offers a more certain path to success			0
better grades means better universities , better universities means better jobs			0
at least that has been ( and will probably still be for a long time ) the belief of many parents and teachers			0
there is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning , after all , that 's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in @entity2			1
a growing urban population and middle class are seeking a better quality of life and personal well - being			1
in 2013 , more than 750,000 people participated in a running competition or marathon , up 50 percent on 2012 , according to the @entity100 in 2014 , there will be 53 marathons registered at the @entity100 and this number is projected to grow at least at 20 percent annually			1
compared to the 200 marathons held each year in @entity105 , @entity2 still has a long way to go but there is a new enthusiasm for sport at the grassroots level			1
however , we also see that more kids ( and parents ) are embracing sport and the values it teaches			1
we operate a sports academy in @entity117 that teaches fencing , squash and @entity121 boxing			2
through a season of sports training and competition , we help kids to build confidence , work in teams and develop leadership skills			1
these are the qualities that will help them to secure that better future over and beyond their academic performance			0
the @entity2 government and many @entity2 educators are starting to see the value of sports in education			1
they could do more by making sports an important part of school grades			0
six years after the @entity55 , there is another @entity4 currently taking place in @entity2 this month -- the 2nd @entity144 in @entity145			0
at the opening ceremony , @entity148 president @entity147 urged participants to take selfies to show off their good fortune and stressed the importance of sharing , learning and making friends			0
most people do n't know who won the first gold medal or how many gold medals @entity2 has won			1
in today 's @entity2 , the demand for sports has gone beyond olympic gold medals and national pride			1
sport in @entity2 : what 's wrong with winning ?			1

the meaning of competitive sports is changing in @entity2
a growing urban population and middle class are seeking a better quality of life and personal well - being through sports
in 2013 , more than 750,000 people participated in a running competition or marathon
more kids are embracing sport and the values it teaches
