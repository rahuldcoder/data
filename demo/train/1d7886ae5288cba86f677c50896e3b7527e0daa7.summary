with the deaths of three top @entity3 officials , questions arose wednesday as to whether the @entity5 attack marks a turning point in the presidency of @entity8			2
as the crisis unfolded , experts looked beyond the day 's events to the roots of @entity3 president @entity8 's power for insights into the 16 - month rebellion that grips the @entity17 nation			1
@entity18 grew up in the shadow of his father , president @entity20 , a @entity21 ally who ruled @entity22 for three decades and helped propel a minority @entity25 population to key political , social and military posts			1
by most accounts , the elder @entity8 governed with an iron fist , forging a police state that quashed opposition by jailing dissidents and marginalizing other political groups			1
@entity20 was born into a poor family and graduated from @entity35 as an air force pilot , before rising in @entity38 leadership and gaining power in the " @entity40 " of 1970			1
his son , @entity41 , enjoyed rare privileges and education as he studied abroad , while his older son , @entity44 , was the man groomed to succeed him and assume power			1
showdown or stalemate in @entity22 ? but when @entity44 died in a car crash in 1994 , @entity41 was thrust into the national spotlight and switched his university focus from medicine to military science			1
" dr. @entity41 , " who had headed the @entity58 , earned a degree in ophthalmology and enjoyed windsurfing , may have appeared an unlikely choice			1
but many observers in @entity60 and the @entity61 seemed heartened by the incoming president , who presented himself as a fresh , youthful leader who might usher in a more progressive , moderate regime			1
@entity65 , whom he married in 2000 , is a former investment banker of @entity3 descent who grew up in @entity68			1
get to know @entity22 's first family when @entity8 's father died in june of that year , it took just hours for the @entity3 parliament to amend the constitution and lower the presidential age of eligibility from 40 to 34 , a move that allowed @entity41 to succeed his father			1
within weeks , he was also made a member of the regional command for the ruling @entity38 , a requirement of succession			2
" i shall try my very best to lead our country towards a future that fulfills the hopes and legitimate ambitions of our people , " @entity8 said during his inauguration speech			2
but @entity90 hopes for a more moderate @entity22 sank when the new leader promptly maintained his country 's traditional ties with militant groups , such as @entity95 and @entity96			2
attack threatens @entity8 's grip on power suspicions later surfaced among the country 's regional neighbors over whether @entity22 was developing a covert nuclear program			0
meanwhile , @entity8 repeatedly vowed to stamp out corruption while strengthening his own grasp on power			0
but in recent months -- and after more than a decade in power -- the @entity3 leader has drawn criticism from around the globe as he 's met popular protests and unrest with force			0
@entity114 came early in presidency thousands have been killed and many more displaced as the conflict has unfolded , with state security forces firing on demonstrators , many of whom have joined opposition groups , including armed rebel brigades			0
as pressure has mounted , the inner circle of the @entity3 leader has became more of a family affair , said @entity127 , a professor of @entity17 history and author of " @entity130 of @entity5 : @entity8 and @entity22			0
" " that 's part of what @entity41 has been doing ever since he came to power , " @entity127 said			1
" he has put members of his extended family ... in various parts of government and military security apparatus			0
if the day came -- and it did come -- where there was a threat to the regime , he could count on the loyalty of those closest to him			0
" the president 's family belongs to the country 's minority @entity25 sect , who are largely driven by fears that they could be overwhelmed should @entity8 lose power , according to the president 's uncle @entity154			2
recent reports , however , suggest discontent even within the minority community over his handling of the crisis			0
@entity162 's king calls attack ' tremendous blow ' to regime @entity18 's youngest brother , @entity165 , is thought to be @entity22 's second-most powerful man , overseeing two of the army 's strongest units : the @entity170 , which protects the regime in @entity5 , and the elite @entity172 , which suppressed the early uprisings in southern @entity22			1
but on wednesday , a rebel attack killed defense minister @entity175 ; deputy defense minister @entity176 -- @entity8 's brother - in - law ; and @entity178 , @entity8 's security adviser and assistant vice president , according to state television			2
@entity176 was once in charge of the army 's intelligence services and was said to be one of the president 's closest allies			2
interior minister @entity189 was among those injured in the blast , state tv said , adding that he " is in good health and that his condition is stable			0
" wednesday 's attack occurred during a meeting of ministers and security officials and was coordinated by rebel brigades in @entity5 , opposition groups say			0
@entity18 quickly named gen. @entity200 as defense minister , according to the state - run news agency @entity202			1
state media also reported that authorities have killed or captured a " large number " of terrorist infiltrators in @entity5 and inflicted " heavy losses " on terrorists in @entity210 and @entity211			0
but video from a @entity5 suburb showed @entity3 rejoicing after news spread of the bombing			0
meanwhile , reports of deaths across the country occur almost every day , with a @entity68 - based opposition group reporting last week that government forces carried out a massacre in @entity222 , killing 220 people there			0
horrific images out of @entity226 @entity18 's administration has consistently said that its forces are targeting armed terrorists funded by outside agitators			1
in early july , @entity8 told a @entity232 television station that a months - old peace plan aimed at ending the violence has n't failed , but rather has yet to be implemented because foreign countries are supporting " terrorists			0
" former @entity238 secretary - general @entity237 , named as a special envoy to the region , has spearheaded the peace effort			0
the president 's remarks came on the same day that @entity61 secretary of state @entity244 held that the days for the @entity3 regime are numbered			1
noting recent defections , @entity246 said , " the sand is running out of the hourglass			0

@entity18 grew up in the shadow of his father , the late president @entity20
his father ruled with iron fist , jailing some dissidents and marginalizing others
his son , @entity41 , enjoyed rare privileges and education as he studied abroad
but those in @entity60 and the @entity61 *initially* seemed heartened by the incoming president
