@entity1 the lame duck is loose			2
little more than two years before the moment he stands next to his successor at the presidential inauguration of 2017 , president @entity3 is feeling unshackled from the constraints of eyeing the next election cycle after last month 's disastrous midterms for @entity10			1
simply put , top @entity12 officials say , the president is on a mission to get stuff done			2
from his dramatic decision to open up diplomatic relations with @entity18 to his executive actions on immigration , @entity3 no longer has to worry about the hand - wringing of endangered @entity10 concerned with reelection			1
" i think it 's absolutely true , " former @entity12 press secretary and @entity2 political contributor @entity23 said			0
" having lost ( the @entity10 ) , it does provide some liberation to him			0
" the unbridled @entity3 even took the time to call in to a @entity30 radio show to needle his friend , outgoing @entity30 gov. @entity31			1
the " fourth quarter " policy blitz that is underway at the @entity34 is similar in some respects to the " bear is loose " image strategy the @entity12 employed last summer			0
the looser and more active @entity3 appears , the more the public likes him , aides thought at the time			1
asked how he felt about being a " lame duck " at his post-midterm news conference , @entity3 said he planned to squeeze as much as he could into his final years in office			1
" you know , if you look at the history of almost every president , those last two years , all kinds of stuff happens			2
in some cases , stuff that we could n't predict , " the president said			2
current @entity12 press secretary @entity53 said @entity3 accomplished his goal of making 2014 a " year of action , " filled with executive orders carried out with the president 's " pen and phone			1
" " there is a lot more that needs to get done and the president has a long list of things that he 's looking forward to tackling in the new year after a couple weeks with his family after the holidays , " @entity53 told reporters at his final press briefing of 2014			1
privately , senior aides push back on the notion that @entity3 has adopted the newly frenetic pace solely because the midterms are behind him			1
the administration 's sanctions on @entity76 may only now be paying dividends but they were applied over a course of the last year			0
re-establishing ties with @entity18 , one official notes , was a long - term project that began 18 months ago			1
" if @entity10 had kept the @entity10 , @entity3 would still be doing this , " @entity23 said about @entity18			1
but @entity23 said the transfer of the gavel of the powerful @entity85 from current chairman sen. @entity86 -- a @entity87 and fierce critic of @entity3 's @entity18 policy -- to @entity90 sen. @entity90 of @entity91 may have helped somewhat			1
" it 's more difficult when the chairman is your own party member , " @entity23 added			0
losing control of @entity95 to @entity96 has pushed @entity3 into the late presidency " refuge " of foreign policy			1
" he has an enormous capacity to act and that , i think , is what he is doing , " said @entity100 , a @entity101 analyst at the @entity102			0
case in point is the administration 's long - delayed but persistent hope to contain @entity111 's nuclear program			0
a deadline for a deal with the @entity111 government was pushed back again just weeks ago			0
" he 's now in a position for a comprehensive agreement , " @entity100 said of post-midterm @entity3			1
the unpredictability of the @entity121 brothers could create headaches for the @entity3 administration and , by extension , the @entity10 heading into 2016			1
" @entity125 is going to have a hard time with this one , " @entity100 said			0
but successes in foreign policy could easily translate into higher approval ratings			0
witness the strides made by @entity132 at the end of the @entity134			0
@entity132 's cry , " mr. @entity135 , tear down this wall , " still resonates today			0
@entity3 's standing in public opinion polls are situated nearly where @entity132 's popularity stood at the same point in his second term , according to @entity144 , the founding director of the respected @entity145			2
" indeed views of @entity3 are not any worse than were attitudes toward @entity132 at about this time in his second term			2
understanding the arc of a presidential popularity rating , especially one as varied as @entity3 's , requires a longer perspective than a single midterm snapshot , " @entity144 , @entity145 's founding director wrote in a @entity148 op - ed. @entity132 was also buoyed by a rapidly expanding economy			2
as the @entity3 @entity12 is finding , the economic picture is finally brightening after the worst recession since the @entity156			2
" the economy is doing well			0
it 's in a good place			0
it 's going to be in a better place , " @entity23 said .			0

president @entity3 , freed from the *burden* of further elections , is hoping to get things done
from normalizing relations with @entity18 to pressing for immigration changes , @entity3 is active
