-- @entity2 rep. @entity1 of @entity3 is considered a rising @entity5 star and the @entity5 's leader on fiscal and budgetary issues			1
the chairman of the @entity9 was first elected to @entity10 at age 28 , and later helped launch the party 's " @entity16 " program to recruit candidates in districts where @entity5 lost			1
now 42 , @entity1 is the architect of the @entity9 @entity5 's budget proposal , which @entity18 compared to an attack on the poor , but @entity5 say is intended to save @entity21 and rein in spending			1
the chairman of the @entity9 was announced as the running mate for presumptive @entity5 nominee @entity24			1
" it 's [ @entity24 's ] decision months from now , not mine			1
so why spend my time thinking about it ? if this bridge ever comes that i should cross it , then i 'll think about it then			0
it 's not the time to think about it , " he told @entity33 in april			0
@entity24 announces @entity1 as running mate a native of @entity37 , @entity3 , @entity1 earned a degree in political science and economics from @entity41 in @entity42 in 1992			1
he was raised as a @entity43 , and worked at a family construction company before getting into politics			0
he 's known to be an avid hunter and a fitness fanatic			0
in the @entity9 , @entity1 is also a senior member of the @entity48			2
he has frequently pushed the @entity5 ' " class warfare " line against president @entity50 and is a major critic of his signature health reform law			0
" if you give us more elected representatives to fix this problem , we will fix this problem in 2013 , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity55			2
because he hails from @entity3 , an important battleground , @entity1 's youthfulness could appeal to a group with whom the president enjoys advantages			1
@entity1 is considered a lightning rod , and his presence on the @entity5 ticket will fundamentally change the 2012 race			1
where does @entity24 stand on the @entity1 plan ? " it would be a bold choice , " @entity0 senior analyst @entity72 said earlier of a @entity24 - @entity1 ticket			1
" it would be a risky choice			0
" but there are upsides			0
@entity1 will likely energize a @entity5 base often suspicious of @entity24 , and add youthful vigor to the race with his energetic debates and campaign methods			1
close friends such as former @entity9 colleague @entity86 are adamant @entity1 would help across the @entity87			2
@entity1 's college years " i think he does get @entity3 , " @entity86 said			1
" but i think more importantly he gets that sort of blue - collar conservatism that i think is at the heart of the @entity5			0
" for months , @entity24 has tried to frame the race as a referendum on the first @entity50 term , specifically the president 's economic record			1
adding @entity1 to the ticket would mean no escaping an onslaught of @entity18 criticism that the @entity5 ticket would " end @entity21 as we know it " as sen. @entity103 of @entity104 is fond of saying			2
@entity1 , by the numbers one ad , by nonprofit political organization @entity107 , critical of the @entity1 budget showed a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair off a cliff , and ended with the tagline : " @entity114 beautiful without @entity21 ? ask @entity1 and his friends in @entity10			2
" @entity1 calls the attacks demagoguery and says @entity50 has failed to put forward serious proposals to reform costly entitlement programs			2
this is the " bold " debate conservatives pushing @entity1 want , but other @entity5 worry it could steer the campaign focus away from the president and onto @entity5 proposals			2
other potential downsides include @entity1 is a @entity9 member popular in what was once considered a competitive swing district , but he has never run statewide			1
he also has no foreign policy experience			0
interactive timeline in light of the @entity133 2008 pick , some will question whether the @entity9 member is ready to be commander - in - chief			0
" he is without question one of the stars of the @entity5 future over the next 10 to 20 years , " @entity72 said			0
" whether he is ready at this moment , only the campaign trail could tell			0
and he 's going to get , i 'll tell you , he is going to take a real beating			0
" @entity1 is also a policy wonk , a self - described nerd who cut his teeth working for conservatives @entity147 and @entity149			2
friends say it would be a mistake to underestimate his ambition , or his competitive streak			0
how do you feel about @entity24 picking @entity1 as his running mate ? let us know on @entity157			1
