-- looking for a vacation that will shock all five of your senses ? @entity5 can help			1
season 4 of " @entity5 : @entity8 " starts in the fall			1
in the meantime , here are seven ideas drawn from some of his best adventures			2
brave a bullfight in @entity16 @entity5 paid a visit to @entity18 , the private bullring of star matador @entity20 -- who is professionally known as @entity21			1
@entity21 , one of the world 's top bullfighters , is as known for his courage as he is for his flashy antics in the ring			2
you probably wo n't get personal pointers from @entity21 , but just witnessing this spectacle can be breathtaking			2
although many consider bullfighting an art , the sport is not without controversy			2
many are morally opposed to what they consider taunting and brutally slaughtering an animal in a very public arena			2
the ethical debate is a hot - button issue frequently debated in @entity16 parliament " to see @entity16 , to see it straight , to understand it at all , you should probably peek -- if only through spread fingers -- at that most @entity16 of traditions , bull fighting , " said @entity5			1
" there is no denying the terrible beauty of a very complex tradition			2
the matadors were the original rock stars , the very ideal of masculinity , male beauty and grace			2
" you may never set foot in a bullring , but you can shout " @entity57 © ! " from the sidelines if you find yourself in @entity16			2
the bullrings in @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 will get you started			2
sing the blues in @entity63 before he started traveling around the world , @entity5 admits that he never would have considered visiting @entity63			1
but his dim view of the very @entity66 soon widened into a love for a very special part of his own country			2
especially what he considers the @entity74 ' " most powerful and persuasive export and gift to the world " : the blues			0
@entity63 's poverty means regular renovations generally are n't a top priority			0
but the rustic atmosphere is part of the @entity82 's charm			0
many places where the blues are performed look exactly the same today as they did more than a half - century ago			0
" the blues , rock ' n ' roll , @entity87 , soul and funk , all came out of this place			0
@entity63 , " said @entity5			1
if you feel like venturing to the @entity82 this summer , check out @entity94 's and other spots along the @entity96 and stop at @entity97 for soul food nibbles			0
getting to know the @entity98 take a gamble in @entity100 if you 're willing to peek behind the facade , you can experience @entity5 's @entity102 -- a @entity100 remarkably void of @entity103 , migraine - inducing bright lights and spinning reels of slot machine fruit			1
when @entity5 visited @entity102 in @entity107 , he experienced a city that few people see			1
he saw the polar opposites of the spectrum : from the ultra-exclusive @entity114 at @entity116 and a nightclub whose patrons drop thousands of dollars on drinks in a single evening , to a local tavern and an eatery dripping with old vegas charm far , far off the beaten path of the @entity102			0
" @entity123 and the mob are gone , but there remains , still , a certain sentimental attachment to the way things used to be			0
a way that things were done			0
and when they were n't done , there was always the desert and a hole in the ground , " @entity5 said			1
if you want to roll the dice on a different kind of experience , try local favorites like the @entity143 , the @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			0
10 things you did n't know about @entity102 go gun - slinging out @entity149 with a stunning landscape and big open sky , many people gravitate to the state some refer to as the @entity154			2
a large @entity156 population , a hippie influx that began in the 1970s and the largest @entity159 population per capita in the @entity74 give @entity154 a unique @entity74 cultural blend			0
it was in @entity154 that @entity5 explored the @entity163 cowboy mystique			1
with its relaxed gun laws , target shooting is an option for a fun outing with friends			0
some children receive rite - of - passage rifles the same way other kids get baseball bats			0
" we are a gun culture			0
the expression of @entity74 power and identity has always been the lone cowboy with a gun			0
this is the heart of the @entity74 dream			0
love it or hate it , this is it , " @entity5 said			1
get a taste of @entity154 's culture -- with care			0
the @entity189 is operated by the @entity190 , providing " an alternative to illegal firearm practice on our mesas , open spaces and vacant areas , " according to its website			0
10 things to know before visiting @entity154 sleigh ride in @entity200 lovely weather for a sleigh ride may be a few months off , but it 's never too early to plan ahead			1
@entity5 traveled to @entity203 and filmed an episode with his longtime friend / drinking buddy @entity206			1
at one point , they toured the wintry terrain outside of @entity200 on a traditional troika , a sleigh pulled by a team of three horses			1
bundled in blankets and sipping vodka from flasks , they rode through the countryside where the city 's wealthiest residents have their country homes , or dachas , and emperor @entity223 built his 18th - century home			0
" the rest of @entity203 is very , very different than @entity226 , " @entity5 said			1
" i mean ( in @entity226 ) , you drive around , and it 's like @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , you know			0
you go to buy a pair of shoes , you pick up a @entity229 on the way out			0
" near @entity200 , you can experience a more traditional side of @entity203 with a troika ride -- flasks optional			1
try rides in @entity239 or through the grounds of @entity241			0
ride a human - powered @entity242 in @entity243 in the very first episode of " @entity8 , " @entity5 explored @entity245			1
while the government has relaxed some of its hold of the @entity243 nation , it 's still controlled by a military regime			0
at one of the evening street fairs in @entity254 , @entity5 happened upon a human - powered @entity242			1
powering the wheel requires its operators -- flip - flop - clad local teenage boys -- to move quickly through the structure , making it turn with the weight and momentum of their bodies an " absolutely insanely dangerous , closely choreographed process , " @entity5 said			1
if , unlike @entity5 , you 'd like to give a human - powered @entity242 a whirl , the rides can be found at night markets and street fairs throughout @entity243 and southern @entity271			1
take a midnight train goin ' anywhere the night train to @entity200 is one of the most fun things to do in @entity203 , @entity5 said			1
@entity277 through dark , snow - covered birch forests , he and @entity206 enjoyed caviar , pickled herring , and of course , vodka			0
in stark contrast , he also took the night train to @entity245 's ancient capital of @entity284			1
the 20 - plus hour journey ( it was supposed to take 10 ) intermittently picked up terrifying speeds on a train where derailments , known as " rail - slips , " are quite common			2
" six hundred kilometers of what will turn out to be kidney - softening travel by rail ... so really the question on this end of the journey is : come back on the train , or fly back in a coffin ? " he joked			1
for @entity5 , night trains leave a lasting impression .			1

follow in the footsteps of @entity5 with these travel ideas
ride through the winter landscape in a troika outside of @entity200
take a night train almost anywhere for *interesting* *memories*
