@entity0 -- @entity4 was " an extraordinary leader and an extraordinary woman , " @entity3 prime minister @entity2 said in a special session of @entity7 wednesday			1
he led tributes to @entity3 's only female prime minister two days after her death at age 87 from a stroke			2
meanwhile , @entity4 's son @entity13 said that although his mother had been " blessed with a long life and a very full one , " the family 's loss is still difficult to bear			1
the family is " enormously proud " and grateful that @entity19 will attend her funeral next week , he said			2
the lawmakers have been called back early from recess for the special parliamentary session to honor @entity4 's memory			1
@entity4 led the @entity25 from 1975 to 1990 and was prime minister for 11 years			1
@entity2 told lawmakers it is important not to underestimate the " thickness of the glass ceiling " she faced at that time			1
her achievement in breaking through it to become a member of @entity7 , then a minister and then prime minister was remarkable , he said			2
he also praised her leadership in the @entity39 in 1982 , when @entity3 repelled an @entity41 invasion of the disputed @entity42 , also known as the @entity42			0
while prime minister , @entity4 lived under " direct personal threat " from the @entity45 , @entity2 added			1
he paid tribute to her courage as he recalled that she lost two parliamentary colleagues to @entity45 terrorism , and was " inches away from death " in a 1984 @entity45 bomb attack on a @entity55 hotel where lawmakers were staying during a @entity25 conference			0
the funeral with military honors planned for next wednesday will be a " fitting " tribute , @entity2 said			1
" she made the political weather , she made history , and let this be her epitaph : she made @entity3 great again , " he concluded			2
praise and criticism from the opposition @entity69 , leader of the opposition @entity70 , paid tribute to @entity4 's achievements but at the same time pointed out he disagreed with many of her decisions			1
" whatever your view of her , @entity4 was a unique and towering figure , " he said , and a " prime minister who defined her age			1
" she was right to see that the @entity3 economy needed to change , to encourage aspiration and to defend the @entity42 when @entity41 invaded , he said			0
but it would be dishonest not to say that she was wrong on other things , he said			0
these include calling @entity89 's @entity88 a terrorist organization , passing legislation that made it illegal to " promote " homosexuality in schools , and her treatment of @entity3 's coal miners when she took on the trades unions			1
many in mining communities felt " angry and abandoned , " he said			0
deputy prime minister @entity100 , of the @entity101 , kept his remarks brief -- pointing out that @entity4 's legacy still provokes strong feelings in many people in his northern @entity107 constituency			1
but whatever your views of her policies , he said , " it 's impossible to deny the indelible imprint @entity4 made both on the nation and the wider world			1
" she was a towering figure " not as written in the history books but still in the prime of her political life , " he said			2
the comments from those outside her party reflect the fact that @entity4 was a highly polarizing leader , whose influence on @entity3 politics is still felt more than 20 years after she left office			1
there were noticeably more empty seats on the opposition side of the chamber in the @entity135			0
but many on both sides of the house laughed , sometimes fondly and sometimes ruefully , as lawmakers recounted anecdotes about their own interactions with @entity4			1
she earned the nickname " the @entity143 " for her personal and political toughness in office			0
the session in the @entity135 is expected to last several hours			0
the @entity147 , where @entity4 served after she was ennobled to @entity4 of @entity149 following her departure from office , is also holding a session in her honor			1
former conservative leader @entity153 , now @entity154 , defended her approach to decision - making , seen by many as divisive			2
" if she had waited for consensus , nothing would ever have happened , " he said			0
" she saw what needed to be done and she did it , with clarity , with courage and with compassion			0
" very few people have made a contribution to the nation on the scale of that of @entity4 , he said , and " the light of her legacy will shine as a beacon down the generations			1
" lord @entity178 , a former chairman of the @entity25 and a cabinet minister under @entity4 , recalled her kindness to him and his wife after they were badly injured in the @entity55 bombing			1
working for her was made easier by the firmness of her convictions , he added			2
the last time both houses of @entity7 were recalled during a recess was in summer 2011 , when @entity0 and other cities were rocked by riots and looting			0
divided opinion a towering figure in postwar @entity3 and global politics , @entity4 is remembered in the world for her @entity196 - era friendships with @entity199 president @entity198 and @entity201 leader @entity200 , as well as her role in shaping @entity3 's place in @entity204 and the short , sharp war she waged with @entity41 over the disputed @entity42			1
at home , she divides opinion			0
many @entity3 blame her for creating soaring unemployment , when she reduced or eliminated many government subsidies to business and took on the unions			0
her battle with striking coal miners won her few friends in mining communities in northern @entity107 and @entity218			0
but supporters believe the tough reforms she pushed through transformed the @entity3 economy and gave many working people new freedoms			0
preparations are already under way for a funeral to be held next wednesday at @entity228			0
with full military honors , it will rival those given to @entity232 , @entity233 and the @entity234			2
the queen , accompanied by husband @entity236 , will be among the high - profile guests			0
what do you think about the loss of @entity3 's ' iron lady ' ? tell us however , prince @entity243 and his wife , @entity244 , who 's expecting their first child , will not attend the funeral , nor will prince @entity248 , prince @entity249 or his wife , @entity250 , @entity251 said			2
the announcement that @entity4 would receive a " ceremonial " style funeral , one step down from the state funeral usually reserved for the monarch , has prompted heated debate in the @entity3			2
while some supporters want her to be given a state funeral , others have questioned whether she merits a send - off on par with that of @entity232 's			2
opinion : why @entity4 was the ' @entity143 ' the service , which will be televised , will be followed by a private cremation , @entity2 's office said tuesday			1
crowds are expected to line the streets between the @entity271 -- where her coffin will lie on the eve of the funeral -- and @entity228			0
on the day of the funeral , the coffin will travel by hearse from @entity279 to a @entity281 chapel , where it will be transferred to a gun carriage drawn by the @entity284			0
from there , it will be taken in procession to @entity228 along a route lined by servicemen and women from the army , @entity292 and @entity281			0
@entity4 's family and friends will wait inside the cathedral with many who worked with her in government and elsewhere			1
