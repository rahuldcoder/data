@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's arrival in the packed auditorium at a @entity1 screening of his latest film , " @entity7 , " causes a well - behaved sizzle of excitement to run through the largely female and @entity11 audience			1
@entity4 takes a walk on the dark side in " @entity7			1
" his name is whispered breathlessly between friends , but in a classic display of @entity11 politeness , the only indication there is a genuine heartthrob in the room are a couple of poorly contained shrieks			1
tall , exquisitely chiseled and with the kind of smooth line - free skin that belies his 38 years , it 's not hard to see why @entity4 is also known as the " @entity28 of @entity11			1
" in his native @entity29 he is best known for brooding , soulful performances in romantic films and tv dramas			1
he 's a hot star now , especially after his eye - catching performance in " @entity7 , " says @entity36 , deputy @entity11 editor based in @entity29 for global film trade magazine @entity38			1

" @entity4 has also wrapped up filming on the highly anticipated @entity60 action flick , " @entity61 : rise of @entity62			1
" @entity4 is in @entity1 to promote " @entity7 , " and is polite and unassuming in person , taking time to reflect as he delivers his responses in @entity0			1
" people told me , ' your eyes changed			0
you look so bad , ' " @entity4 says of playing the film 's titular " @entity68 , " a sadistic killer who heads up a gang of bandits			1
" i was so happy about that			0
" from his black leather - clad hands to his wild , psychotic eyes , an air of cool , remorseless detachment envelops him			0
in a review , @entity80 described @entity4 's eyes as " commanding " and having a " @entity29 psycho - gangster mentality			1
" it is an unsettling performance , and one of the film 's many highlights			0
after playing primarily romantic leads , @entity4 says playing a villain was a refreshing experience for him and something he 'd been thinking about for his entire acting career			1
" actors always want to play the villain role at least once in their life			0
i had a good time because i could finally realize a full range of expressions and emotions , " he told @entity2			0
set in the 1930s , the film follows three @entity29 outlaws on a chase across the desert plains of @entity40 - occupied @entity105 on a hunt for a legendary treasure map			2
the movie hits on a trifecta : it stars three of @entity29 's leading actors ( @entity4 is joined on screen by @entity113 and @entity114 ) , has a massive $ 17 million budget and is helmed by the award - winning @entity49			1
with stunning wide shots of endless horizons filmed in @entity126 's @entity125 and edge - of - your - seat action from start to finish , @entity49 's homage to @entity119 's 1966 classic " @entity122 , " with more than a hint of " @entity121 " delivers a steady stream of adrenaline			0
have you seen " @entity7 ? " what did you think ? @entity4 says his character was perfected through several conversations , discussions and arguments with @entity49 , a close friend who also directed him in 2005 's " @entity138			1
" everybody has bad characters in their mind , even if it may be small or in their subconscious , @entity4 explains , referring to his preparation for the role			2
" of course , i have that kind of character inside of me , i think			0
so , i amplified my bad side			0
but the main thing is the mind , i think , which comes from the inside , " he told @entity2			0
@entity4 has always had star power , says @entity154 from @entity38			2
" but he had to grow into his acting chops			0
he worked prolifically in tv and film , and seems serious about his career choices , " she says			0
this role is the screen idol 's latest step in a slow break out from " type , " since his turn as an enforcer for an underworld boss in the film noir " @entity138			0
" in @entity29 , where celebrities are closely scrutinized by the public and @entity172 gossip is rampant , @entity4 , who is a target because of his film star status , says he tries his best to steer clear of online chatter			1
the spread of rumors over the @entity178 is one of the biggest problems that exists in @entity29			2
the recent suicide of one of the nation 's leading actresses was blamed on online gossip			0
" there has to be change , " @entity4 said			2
" i try not to read those kinds of things			0
i think it 's better to do that			0
" this may have been easier for him recently , as he has been busy working on projects outside of @entity29 , although , he says these too hold their challenges			2
working in @entity60 was difficult , especially acting in @entity0 which , says @entity4 , made it harder for him to focus on his emotions and expressions			1
@entity4 plays @entity199 in the action movie " @entity61 , " which is due for release next summer			1
the movie , based on the popular comic and cartoon series , boasts a star - studded cast , including @entity206 and @entity207			0

it was really hard , " he said about filming " @entity61			2
" " but it was a very good experience for me			0
" he 's now back in @entity29 working but is n't ruling out the possibility of returning to @entity60			1
