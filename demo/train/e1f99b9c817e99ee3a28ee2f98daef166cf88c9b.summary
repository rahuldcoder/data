both teams had already guaranteed their passage through to the knockout stages with both winning their opening two matches , but it was the @entity13 who came out on top in a close encounter in @entity17			1
a 62nd - minute goal from @entity19 proved enough against an under - strength @entity21 side , who chose to rest some of their top players including skipper @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , nevertheless , the 2004 champions proved a handful as they had the better of the opening exchanges			2
but it was @entity1 who came closest to scoring in the first half when @entity3 failed to clear their lines from an @entity19 cross			0
the resulting chance fell to skipper @entity39 but he conspired to drag his shot wide			0
four minutes after @entity41 scored , @entity39 was presented with another chance to score but once again his shot was off - target			0
the win left him and his teammates with nothing to rue as they claimed the three points , setting up a meeting with the runners - up in @entity50 in @entity51 next sunday			2
@entity3 will face the winners of @entity50 in @entity5 's other match , @entity53 took all three points beating @entity56 1 - 0			1
