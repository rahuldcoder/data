-- @entity3 's newly launched satellite marks a " big deal " for @entity5 , the crossing of a major threshold and a public relations win for the secretive country 's new leader , @entity9 , experts say			1
the success , after years of failed attempts , triggered worries among world leaders about nuclear weapons , @entity16 and the balance of power in the @entity18			1
@entity20 defense secretary @entity19 called the launch " clear provocation			1
" experts do not believe @entity3 has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that @entity5 has now proved it can send long - distance			1
and the @entity20 believes the @entity3 may not have full control of the satellite they launched into space wednesday , according to one @entity20 official who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information			2
but the launch allowed the regime to flex its military and technological muscle on the world stage			2
@entity19 told @entity0 he is " very confident " that if @entity3 were to launch a missile at the @entity20 , the @entity20 military could guard against it			1
@entity3 silences doubters , raises fears with rocket launch " obviously the hope is that we never have to face that kind of threat , " @entity19 said			1
a central reason the @entity20 is working to " rebalance the @entity18 " is to deal with " the threat from @entity3 , " he added			1
there is " a path for @entity3 to end its isolation , but that requires abiding by its international obligations , " @entity50 spokesman @entity49 said wednesday			1
" ... it has chosen not to , and therefore , there will be consequences for that			2
" @entity60 is leading the global response , threatening to impose sanctions on @entity5 like those that have helped devastate @entity16 's economy			1
those efforts were under way wednesday in @entity69 meetings at @entity71 headquarters in @entity72 " members of the @entity69 condemned this launch , " the council said in a statement , calling it " a clear violation " of previous resolutions -- including one in april that demanded @entity3 halt any launches using ballistic missile technology			1
success raises stakes for @entity20 missile defense system the council considers the issue urgent , the statement said			0
@entity88 , @entity20 ambassador to the @entity71 , called the statement one of the swiftest and strongest she had seen the council make about @entity3			1
" now we go into the second phase " of discussions , she said : negotiations about what to do			0
@entity96 and @entity97 , @entity3 allies and two of the council 's permanent members , could exercise their veto power			1
the @entity20 and other nations may impose unilateral measures , senior administration officials warned			0
but @entity5 has ignored such threats before			0
new @entity71 sanctions are unlikely , but the council might step up pressure on @entity3 in other ways , said @entity110 , a professor with the @entity112 's @entity111 , who last year served on a @entity71 panel of experts monitoring sanctions already in place against @entity3			1
the council 's sanctions committee could add more @entity3 entities to the sanctions list , he said			1
it could also do more to enforce sanctions already in place , for example by increasing inspections of cargo leaving @entity3 to ensure no weapons technology is being shipped out			1
@entity3 may not have ' full control ' of satellite , @entity20 official says what the launch means wednesday 's success was a breakthrough for the reclusive , nuclear - equipped state			1
@entity3 " could sell this technology to others , including @entity16 and @entity142 , who have been regular customers of @entity3 's other missiles , " warns @entity137 , who analyzes the region for the @entity139			1
" they still have other technological thresholds to cross ( miniaturized warheads , reentry vehicle ) , but this was undeniably a major one			0
" the rocket blasted off from a space center on the country 's west coast and delivered a satellite into its intended orbit , the @entity3 regime said			2
the launch followed a botched attempt in april and came just days after @entity5 suggested that a planned launch could be delayed			2
@entity96 reaction key as neighbors decry @entity3 rocket launch @entity3 's previous claims of successful launches have been dismissed by the @entity20 and other countries			1
but this time , a @entity20 official confirmed that the object is in orbit			0
@entity20 officials were looking into whether it is an operating satellite , the official said			0
the regime 's state - run @entity172 said the satellite , named @entity179 , was " fitted with survey and communications devices essential for the observation of the earth			0
" the satellite itself is probably not very sophisticated , said @entity182 , a senior scientist with the @entity183			0
the regime showed it in april , and it was a small box with solar panels and a simple camera with some basic communication devices , he said			0
opinion : name and shame @entity96 over @entity3 launch he compared it to @entity196 , the first man - made satellite that @entity97 launched into space in 1957			1
the value lies in the launch rather than in the object that @entity3 now has floating above the @entity203 , @entity182 said			1
the regime does n't " really care so much what 's in it			0
" it 's a statement , @entity182 said			0
in @entity209 and @entity210 , people will hear about @entity3 's achievement -- and will probably be struck by its power , he said			2
any show of might can help strengthen @entity3 's position in international talks on numerous issues , including nuclear negotiations			2
the @entity210 government said the launch was confrontational and a " threat to the peace and stability of the @entity223 and the world			2
" @entity209 called it " intolerable			0
" the cost of launching a rocket @entity16 praises the launch as much of the world assails it @entity16 , meanwhile , praised @entity3 's move			1
gen. @entity232 , a senior @entity16 military official , expressed happiness about the launch , the semiofficial @entity231 reported			1
" experience has shown that independent countries , by self - confidence and perseverance , can quickly reach the height of self - sufficiency in science and technology			0
hegemonic powers , such as the @entity20 , are unable to stop the progress of such countries , " he said			0
@entity96 expressed regret that the launch had taken place , noting " concerns among the international community			1
" " we hope relevant parties stay calm in order to maintain peace and stability on the @entity223 , " said @entity252 , a @entity253 spokesman			0
several governments criticized @entity5 's decision to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on its rocket program rather than on assisting its poor , malnourished population			0
@entity264 foreign secretary @entity263 said he deplored the fact that @entity3 " has chosen to prioritize this launch over improving the livelihood of its people			1
" the @entity271 's failed launch in april ended a deal for the @entity20 to provide thousands of tons of food aid to the country			2
in his father 's footsteps " i think this is very important to @entity9 to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people , " said @entity279 , a @entity3 specialist with the @entity280			2
" he is doing this despite the fact that he knows he is going to come into a lot of criticism in the region for it			0
" the launch has taken place during a period of power consolidation for @entity9 in which he has purged senior military officers in an apparent effort to stamp his authority on the regime 's leadership			2
" if @entity9 pulls off a successful long - range missile test , it 's a very important signal saying that ' yes , i , @entity9 , have replaced the powerful generals , ' " said @entity299 , a @entity300 junior faculty fellow at the @entity301			0
" it shows that ' i have found the right balance and i am now in charge			0
' " opinion : one small step for @entity9 the launch also ties in with important dates for the regime 's ruling dynasty			2
@entity5 had said this rocket launch would be " true to the behests " of @entity316 , the late @entity3 leader and father of @entity9			1
@entity316 died on december 17 last year , so the rocket launch took place just days before tearful mourners are expected to gather for the first anniversary of his death			0
experts had also speculated that @entity3 wanted this launch to happen before the end of 2012 , the year that marks the centenary of the birth of @entity329 , the founder of @entity3 and grandfather of @entity9			1
another factor may also be at play : the launch took place ahead of national elections in @entity209 on sunday and in @entity210 on december 19			0
@entity3 is a crucial foreign policy issue in both of those countries			2
the rocket took off wednesday morning and flew south over @entity209 's @entity340 islands			0
there were conflicting reports about how many parts fell into the sea			0
read more : what does @entity3 's planned rocket launch mean ? a launch had seemed unlikely to take place so soon after @entity3 announced monday that it was extending the rocket 's launch window into late december , citing technical issues with an engine			1
previous attempts by the @entity271 in 1998 , 2006 , 2009 and april of this year failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite into orbit and provoked international condemnation			0
the rockets launched in 1998 and 2009 flew for hundreds of kilometers but did n't succeed in deploying satellites , other countries and experts said at the time			0
@entity3 nonetheless insisted that both satellites did reach orbit , with @entity172 reporting that they were transmitting " immortal revolutionary " songs back to @entity203			2
the 2006 launch failed soon after takeoff and was n't reported by state media			0
in april , the @entity3 regime invited members of the international news media , including @entity0 , into the country to observe the preparations for its planned launch			1
but the strategy backfired when the rocket broke apart shortly after blasting off			0
on that occasion , state media took the unusual step of admitting the launch 's failure			0
timeline : @entity3 's rocket - fueled obsession @entity0 's @entity384 , @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 , @entity390 , @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 and @entity394 , and journalist @entity395 in @entity396 , contributed to this report .			2
