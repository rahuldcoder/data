-- the @entity2 capital of @entity3 has become the focus of efforts to reach a lasting cease - fire in the 10 - day conflict in @entity8			1
the negotiations are shrouded in secrecy			0
but an @entity12 delegation was in @entity3 on thursday amid hopes that new life can be breathed into an @entity2 effort unveiled earlier this week			1
" the initiative is ongoing and we are in touch with all relevant parties , " including the @entity21 , @entity12 and the @entity22 , an @entity2 official told @entity0			2
" we hope the @entity22 leaders will accept the initiative for the protection of the @entity22 people , " he said before going on to urge @entity23 " to stop fire immediately and accept the initiative to avoid further bloodshed			2
" an @entity12 team led by @entity32 -- the head of @entity12 's domestic security agency @entity33 -- spent several hours in @entity3 , according to @entity2 sources			1
@entity12 officials would not comment on the @entity12 envoys ' movements			0
@entity23 also has a delegation in @entity3 , even though it officially rejected the @entity2 proposal , and says the talks are continuing			1
@entity41 , a @entity23 spokesman based in @entity42 , told @entity0 's @entity43 on wednesday : " no one is talking against having a cease - fire , but we want a fair cease - fire to protect our own people for a long time , to protect them from the @entity12 military attacks , from the siege , from the arrests			1
" the president of the @entity52 , @entity51 , is also involved in the negotiations			0
@entity23 ' demands officials close to him echo @entity2 optimism that progress is being made			1
@entity59 , a member of the @entity61 's @entity60 , told @entity0 : " i expect that we will reach an agreement very soon -- a cease - fire that will stop the bloodshed , killing and destruction in @entity8			1
" " all other matters will be discussed afterwards : @entity23 ' demands for opening the @entity8 crossings , ending the siege and releasing prisoners			1
" among the prisoners @entity23 wants freed are some who were among about 1,000 who were released as part of the 2011 deal in which captive @entity12 soldier @entity77 was also freed , but have since been re-arrested			2
" these are all legitimate demands by @entity23 , but the priority is for an immediate ceasefire , " @entity59 told @entity0			2
another senior @entity22 official , @entity81 , who is traveling with @entity51 , said : " we are trying , along with the @entity83 , to extend the temporary humanitarian ceasefire that took place earlier today [ thursday ] on a rolling basis			0
while there is no plan at this point for a comprehensive ceasefire agreement , but we are trying to extend the current one by another six or 10 hours -- or even several days if possible			0
" however , the humanitarian pause for five hours thursday was soon followed by renewed firing in both directions			0
@entity2 's role the wording of the original @entity2 plan monday said that " during the period of the ceasefire ...			0
crossings shall be opened and movements of persons and goods shall be facilitated once the security situation becomes stable			0
" this language and the sequencing are important , because @entity23 is demanding the immediate opening of crossings so that food , medical supplies and other essential goods -- as well as the free movement of people -- can begin			0
analysts say @entity23 wants and needs to show the people of @entity8 that it has won concessions after ten days of bombardment in which more than 200 people have been killed and thousands more have been forced to leave their homes			1
one @entity12 official told @entity0 that @entity12 's military strikes " have been very successful , " bringing closer the prospect of what the official called a period of " sustainable quiet			0
" he said there was no such thing as a perfect solution , but that operations in previous years , especially @entity128 in 2008 - 09 , had been followed by years of relative peace			0
the official also suggested that @entity12 -- with @entity2 's help -- was ready to consider reopening the @entity134 border crossing , but needed guarantees that tunnels between @entity2 and @entity8 would not be dug anew			1
the tunnels have been used for smuggling weapons and material for making rockets			0
and he said that the government of @entity2 president @entity142 in @entity3 was much more cooperative than that of its predecessor , @entity144 , in sealing the tunnels			2
this would bring @entity12 closer to its goal of what prime minister @entity148 has described as the demilitarization of @entity8			0
" we agreed to the @entity2 proposal in order to give an opportunity for the demilitarization of the [ @entity8 ] @entity8 -- from missiles , from rockets and from tunnels -- through diplomatic means , " he said tuesday			2
observers say that for @entity12 , allowing the @entity2 a diplomatic triumph in brokering a deal would be a small price to pay for close coordination in preventing @entity23 from replenishing its armory			1
@entity12 officials say they believe @entity23 is isolated diplomatically and in the @entity168 world , and are encouraged by the absence of protests across the @entity168 world in support of @entity23			2
other efforts the @entity2 initiative is not the only game in town , with president @entity51 due to travel to @entity178 on friday , according to @entity59			1
diplomats say @entity178 and @entity180 have been working on a different formula for a cease - fire , with @entity178 foreign minister @entity183 saying he is involved in " intense diplomacy " to reach a truce			1
@entity23 ' political leader @entity186 --- who lives in @entity180 -- also was in @entity178 this week			1
but @entity12 is unlikely to give that track the time of day			0
its relations with @entity178 are poor , and wo n't be improved after @entity178 prime minister @entity190 accused @entity12 of attempting " systematic genocide " of the @entity22 people			0
and both @entity2 and @entity12 are wary of @entity180 's ambitions in the region , and its close relationship with the @entity196			2
some members of the @entity198 have fled to @entity180 since @entity144 was ousted as president last year			0
