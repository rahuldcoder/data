-- the second - to - last time @entity1 was at @entity2 , she used a scooter to navigate the enormous park			2
her legs were weak and she suffered from foot drop caused by multiple sclerosis			2
that was 4Â½ years ago			0
on her most recent trip , a few months ago , @entity1 walked the entire time , thanks in part to a drug approved by the @entity16 on friday			1
the @entity16 says the drug , @entity18 ( generic name dalfampridine , formerly known as fampridine ) , is the first @entity22 therapy that is taken orally and the first of its kind to receive @entity16 approval			1
it is designed help people with any type of @entity22 improve their walking speed			1
the prime of her life in 2002 , @entity1 was in her 30s and an active hiker and skier with a job on @entity38 and later in @entity39 , @entity40			0
but her life took a turn when she started stumbling , falling down and dragging her right leg			0
her doctor 's diagnosis ? @entity45 , a less common form of @entity22 and , as the name implies , one that usually plagues people with the disease after its initial course			1
the @entity51 defines @entity22 as a " chronic , often disabling disease that attacks the central nervous system , which is made up of the brain , spinal cord and optic nerves			1
" symptoms of @entity22 include extreme fatigue , difficulty walking , problems with memory and heat sensitivity			1
the most common form of @entity22 is relapsing - remitting , in which people have acute attacks followed by periods of remission			1
in secondary progressive , however , the disease worsens steadily and there are no acute flare - ups			0
people with relapsing - remitting may later develop secondary progressive ms. @entity1 says she lived in the same building as her parents at one point because she needed them to help take care of her			2
she says she mostly stayed at home , and when she did venture out she usually walked only a block or two with a cane			0
she relied on a wheelchair for longer distances			0
she says she realized she would eventually be unable to walk			0
" i was scared of being in a wheelchair			0
i was scared of getting worse and worse			0
i had traveled around the world before i got sick , i was super independent , " @entity1 says			0
trying things out after exhausting the usual @entity22 treatments -- and developing intolerable side effects -- @entity1 also became frustrated that the treatments were primarily designed for people with the more common course of the disease , and not the secondary progressive course			1
@entity1 's neurologist then discussed the possibility of trying 4 - aminopyradine -- a version of the same drug the @entity16 approved friday that was available only through compounding pharmacies			1
just three days after taking the drug , @entity1 was able to walk unassisted			2
" i never thought i could put my cane away for good , " she said			0
now she hopes the same drug that helped her will be able to help other people			2
she addressed an @entity16 advisory panel late last year and recommended approval of it			1
" it 's about quality of life , " @entity1 says			0
how it works two phase iii clinical trials of @entity18 showed 35 and 43 percent of patients experienced , on average , a consistent improvement in their walking speed , increasing it by about 25 percent			1
according to the @entity51 , even a modest improvement in walking ability could mean that thousands of people could benefit from the drug			1
dr. @entity122 , executive vice president of @entity123 at the @entity51 , says the drug can be used by most people with @entity22 however , the drug is not for people with a history of seizures or people who have moderate to severe kidney disease			1
@entity122 says approval means patients can now skip the compounding pharmacy and get a consistent , exact dosage in a guaranteed time - released formula , which would lower the risk of getting a toxic dose instead of a therapeutic dose			0
" it 's likely that further study and clinical practice may help to determine the extent to which the drug may impact other functions , and may also provide hints as to which patients are most likely to respond positively to the therapy , " @entity122 said			1
he added that the drug would not help nerves that have been destroyed and emphasized that people should try the drug to see if it works for them			2
@entity18 may not work for everyone			1
" like any medication , people will have different responses , so they should talk to their doctors about whether it 's appropriate to start therapy on @entity18 , " according to a spokesperson from @entity164 , @entity18 's manufacturer			2
moving with ms today , @entity1 is doing well			0
she established the not - for - profit organization @entity167 for a @entity168 , and in three years the organization has raised $ 1.8 million for research and programs to help people living with @entity22 she has also completed several five - mile hikes			2
but she says she is always conscious of where she steps			0
she says she occasionally has some weakness in her leg , but that she is thankful for every day : " i do n't ever take jumping out of bed for granted			0

@entity16 approves @entity18 , the first @entity22 drug of its kind to improve walking speed
@entity18 is appropriate for all types of @entity22 , although it may not help everyone
further studies are needed to see if @entity18 helps with other neurological functions
