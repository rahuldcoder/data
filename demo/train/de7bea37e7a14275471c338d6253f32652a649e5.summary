-- @entity1 fashioned himself as a modern - day gangster			1
he thought big -- getting inspiration from the movies , as when he wore a hockey mask like @entity7 's character in " @entity8 " -- and acted audaciously , attacking armored trucks among other targets			1
after more than a decade in prison , though , the @entity11 insisted he 'd sworn off his wicked ways			1
this promise did n't last for long , according to @entity11 authorities			2
in 2011 , a year after his autobiography came out , @entity1 landed back behind bars			0
now , he is once again free -- and , once again , the subject of an international manhunt after his brazen escape from prison			0
@entity1 held five people , including four guards , at gunpoint at a detention center in the northern city of @entity28 on saturday , officials said			1
he then burst his way to freedom , detonating explosives to destroy five doors , penitentiary union spokesman @entity33 told @entity0 affiliate @entity34			2
where he is now is anyone 's guess			0
@entity11 justice minister @entity38 told reporters on saturday that a @entity41 arrest warrant covering 26 countries has been issued , and that @entity43 is working to track him down as well			1
one person not surprised by @entity1 's breakout is his lawyer , @entity45			2
in a few days , @entity45 had planned to meet his client in preparation of an upcoming trial tied to a may 2010 attack in @entity51 , east of @entity52 , that left a 26 - year - old policewoman dead			0
" he is remarkably intelligent , and he is using his intellect to serve his ambitions , " @entity45 told @entity34			0
" ( and @entity1 ) can not stand being imprisoned anymore			0
" questions raised about prison 's security in his 2010 autobiography , " robber : from suburbs to @entity68 , " @entity1 chronicled his progression from a petty thief to one of @entity11 's most notorious criminals , according to the book 's publisher , @entity66			1
in 1998 , after three years on the run during which he fled to @entity70 , @entity1 was finally caught			2
sentenced to 20 years , he ended up spending more than 10 years in high - security prisons around @entity11			1
after getting out , @entity1 put himself out there -- not only with his book , but as the subject of numerous interviews			0
the high - adrenaline life of crime he described resembled that of another famous @entity11 gangster , @entity79			0
the country 's most wanted man in the 1970s , @entity79 made his name as a charismatic , press - courting criminal known for his daring bank heists and spectacular prison breaks			1
@entity79 's story ended in 1979 , when he was gunned down by police on the streets of @entity52			0
@entity1 's prison escape saturday evokes some of that brand of criminal bravado			1
but it also raises a number of questions : how did an inmate gets guns and explosives ? how did he manage to use those to force his way out ? and , after all that , why is he still at large ? the four guards who @entity1 allegedly held hostage " are safe and sound , " said @entity28 prosecutor @entity101			1
still , officials from the prison guards ' union pressed @entity38 to provide better safety measures inside prisons , including more thorough searches of those who enter , @entity34 reported			0
built in 2005 , the @entity28 - @entity112 penitentiary from which @entity1 escaped is not old , but it 's not well designed to keep watch of prisoners , said @entity115 , a former associate director there			2
" the construction ... makes it particularly difficult to manage detainees , who are particularly difficult to watch , " @entity115 told @entity34 .			0
