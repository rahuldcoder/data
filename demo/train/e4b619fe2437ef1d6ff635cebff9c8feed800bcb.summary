-- eight trailblazing scientists who are about to change your life			2
@entity6 's @entity5 professor @entity4 checks a humanoid robot ' @entity8 ' in june of 2005			1
@entity9 , neurobiologist when @entity10 professor @entity9 wanted to find the key to human communication , he turned to birds			1
@entity9 has been studying songbirds ' brains for insight into human linguistics , and his research has led to a startling discovery : birds use two distinct neural pathways to learn songs -- one in the front of the brain and one in the back			2
guess what ? humans learn to speak in the same way			2
@entity9 believes this is an evolutionary clue suggesting that , when we shared an ancestor 300 million years ago , our brains were hardwired for language			0
theoretically , once @entity9 and other neuroscientists fully understand this genetic blueprint , they can alter it and , in the process , make it easier to learn new languages and possibly even repair brain damage			0
@entity44 , economist a few years ago , as an economics phd student at @entity46 , @entity44 chose to focus her attention on the @entity49 epidemic in @entity50			1
traditionally , that was the turf of sociologists , anthropologists , and public health officials			0
but the 26 - year - old @entity44 was n't afraid to hop the scientific fence and join the other side			0
she also has n't been afraid to suggest things we have n't heard before -- namely , that treating herpes and other @entity60 ( instead of @entity49 ) can significantly reduce @entity62 transmissions			1
@entity44 also believes that while the @entity62 numbers commonly used by the @entity65 , popular press , and researchers are about three times too high , the disease is spreading faster than ever in @entity50			0
by casting her economist 's eyes on the issue , @entity44 has forced the old turf - guarders to reevaluate their approaches to @entity49 in @entity50 and come up with new solutions			1
@entity4 , roboticist most robots look like , well , robots , but @entity4 's robots look remarkably human			1
to many people , this is discomforting -- creepy even			0
to @entity4 , it 's essential			1
as director of @entity5 's @entity82 , @entity4 believes robots ' main role in our future will be to interact naturally with people -- to pitch in as the workforce shrinks or to do necessary , unpleasant tasks			1
and because @entity4 contends that people respond better to his humanlike robots ( aka , androids ) than other machine - like ones , he 's taken a no - holds - barred approach to studying cognitive behavior and human activity			1
in addition to nearly perfecting his silicone molds and metal skeletons , he 's figured out how to mimic even the most minute human movements , such as breathing , blinking , and even fidgeting			1
the result is " android science			0
" the idea is that by using robots that are indistinguishable from humans in scientific experiments , researchers can still elicit natural responses from their subjects but also have more control over the environment			0
so far , @entity4 has already learned plenty about his students using the @entity114 - 1 , an android version of himself , which he operates via remote control to teach class			0
@entity118 , biological anthropologist pulling a typical all - nighter in med school , @entity118 achieved a not - so - typical feat -- she confirmed the effects of genetics on the evolution of human diseases			0
by inputting different dna sequences into an algorithm she created , @entity118 was able to find genes still linked to their neighbors -- suggesting that their success within the gene pool is due to natural selection , not pure chance			1
@entity118 now plans on using her algorithm to deconstruct the malaria parasite			1
by seeing how the parasite has evolved to develop drug resistances , she hopes to detect genetic vulnerabilities in malaria 's makeup			1
if she 's successful , future cures will be designed to attack those weaknesses			1
meanwhile , @entity118 is n't your typical lab rat			0
she 's the lead singer of the alt - rock band @entity146 and sounds more than a little like @entity147			1
and did we mention that she 's a @entity149 who just graduated summa cum laude from @entity151 in 2006 ? 5			1
@entity152 , aerospace engineer piloting a real - life @entity155 x-wing fighter is every aeronautical engineer 's fantasy , and @entity159 is helping make it a reality			1
a scientist for the @entity163 , @entity159 is setting the direction for the supersonic combustion ramjet -- aka , the scramjet			1
by scooping up oxygen from the atmosphere as it ascends , the scramjet eliminates the need for the heavy liquid oxygen and solid oxidizer used by a typical space shuttle			0
and once it catches on , it will revolutionize air travel			1
how does a 2 - hour flight from @entity177 to @entity178 sound ? or a layover on the @entity180 ? and the best thing is , it 'll all happen sooner than you think			0
in april 2007 , @entity183 successfully test - powered a hydrocarbon - fueled scramjet engine to @entity185			0
@entity186 , probabilistic roboticist @entity186 is a @entity187 professor who drives a @entity188 -- but not just any @entity188			1
@entity186 's @entity189 is autonomous , and its name is @entity191			1
the @entity188 drives itself thanks to state - of - the - art road - finding and obstacle - avoidance software , along with radar systems , video screens , and laser range finders			0
like every driver , @entity191 makes mistakes , and @entity186 programmed him with that in mind			2
@entity191 's decisions are based not on absolutes , but on probabilities , which results in more natural and realistic driver reactions			2
but @entity186 is n't so sure people will immediately hand over the keys to a bunch of @entity208			0
it may take up to 30 years , he says , " simply because we do n't know how to insure a car where no one is at the wheel			2
@entity214 , particle physicist and applied string theorist @entity214 thinks big			0
he has a theory that our universe is one of an infinite number of universes -- meaning the largest thing we can wrap our minds around is actually pretty tiny he did n't pull the " multiverse " out of thin air , though			2
after becoming a @entity46 professor at age 30 , @entity214 first made a name for himself by suggesting that our universe is five - dimensional			2
then he moved on to the multiverse , theorizing that our own universe has a hidden feature called " split supersymmetry , " which means that half of all particles have partner particles			0
the theory will be tested soon in @entity240 's brand - new @entity239 ( @entity239 ) , and if the @entity239 finds @entity214 's partner particles , it could prove that the multiverse is real -- and that our place in it is that much smaller			1
@entity245 , astrobiologist hunting for aliens is n't necessarily the most respected academic endeavor in the world , but @entity245 pursued it anyway			0
more precisely , she set out to catalog the stars most likely to develop intelligent alien civilizations			0
@entity245 's system was painstakingly tedious			2
she started with the 120,000 cataloged stars , narrowed down her list to 17,129 ( excluding the ones that were too hot , too close together , or too erratic ) , and then parsed that list down to 100 candidates			0
her final criteria ? an ideal star would be at least 3 billion years old and have a high iron content ( the better to spin off life - yielding planets with )			0
@entity245 's mind - blowing patience has paid off			2
in 2015 , @entity183 will be launching its @entity263 , which will use space telescopes to look for planets beyond our solar system , and it 'll start with the stars on @entity245 's short list			2
in other words , nobody 's laughing at @entity245 's search for aliens now			2
