@entity0 -- the latest attempt at a cease - fire in @entity0 disintegrated friday before it ever really took hold amid accusations that @entity7 militants killed two @entity9 soldiers and captured one			1
blaming @entity11 and its militant allies for the attack on the soldiers , @entity9 resumed shelling of what have been described as militant strongholds in @entity0			2
the announced 72 - hour humanitarian cease - fire between @entity9 and @entity11 did n't even last two hours , by some accounts			1
the pause appears to have eroded after about 90 minutes in @entity21 , a city in southern @entity0 , with the attack on @entity9 soldiers			2
the soldiers were working to destroy a tunnel built by militants to breach @entity9 's border when a militant emerged from it and detonated a suicide bomb , @entity9 military lt. col. @entity23 told @entity1 's @entity31			1
around that time , @entity7 sources told @entity1 they could hear shelling in the area			2
the @entity35 said an @entity9 attack on @entity21 killed at least 62 people and wounded 350			2
@entity11 spokesman @entity38 denied the group had captured a soldier			2
" it 's clear that the capture of the soldier is an @entity9 story ; there 's nothing from the resistance saying there was a capture , " he told @entity1			2
the @entity49 told a different version , saying its troops in @entity21 were attacked in a " brutal incident " that required them to defend themselves			0
at the same time , rockets were fired from @entity0 into southern @entity9 , @entity53 , spokesman for @entity9 's prime minister , told @entity1			2
the @entity49 identified the soldier as 2nd lt. @entity57			1
by late friday , there was no claim of responsibility for the capture of the soldier			0
but there was speculation about his fate took a turn after the militant group , the @entity66 , announced it lost contact with a group of its fighters in the @entity21 area -- the same area where @entity57 was reportedly taken			1
in a statement posted on the brigade 's website , the group says it assumes that all of the fighters were killed in an @entity9 airstrike , including possibly a soldier that @entity9 claims was captured			1
the statement stopped short of definitively saying the soldier was captured , using the phrasing " assuming he was captured by the fighters			2
" future cease - fire ? @entity86 secretary of state @entity85 called the attack on the @entity9 soldiers " an outrageous violation of the cease - fire			1
" it was a sentiment echoed by @entity86 president @entity92 , who told reporters that he was holding @entity11 responsible			1
" i want to make sure they are listening			0
if they are serious about a cease - fire , that soldier needs to be unconditionally released , " @entity92 told reporters in @entity97			1
he went on to say that when @entity11 signs on to a cease - fire , the group is saying it 's in control of the @entity7 factions			1
" i think it 's going to be very hard to put a cease - fire back together again , if @entity9 and the international community ca n't be confident that @entity11 " will honor it , @entity92 said			1
at the same time , the president called the issue of the mounting civilian casualties in @entity0 " heartbreaking			0
" while @entity92 said @entity9 has the right to protect itself , he said the @entity86 has been " clear that innocent civilians in @entity0 caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience , and we have to do more to protect them			1
" with the conflict in its fourth week , more than 1,600 @entity7 have been killed , according to the @entity119 in @entity0			1
of the casualties , the @entity120 has estimated between 70 % and 80 % are civilians			0
since @entity9 began @entity124 against @entity11 on july 8 , three civilians have been killed in @entity9			1
sixty - one @entity9 soldiers have been killed during the hostilities , the @entity49 has said			2
in an overwhelming bipartisan vote , 395 - 8 , the @entity127 on friday gave final congressional approval for another $ 225 million to support @entity9 's @entity131 missile defense system			2
the @entity132 passed the measure earlier friday			0
who 's behind the attack ? if the attack on the soldiers in @entity21 is corroborated , it would be a violation by @entity0 militants of the cease - fire that had been in place , said @entity143 , @entity120 special coordinator for the @entity145 peace process			1
the violation would be " condemned in the strongest terms , " he said			0
however , the office of @entity120 @entity149 ban ki - moon clarified that the " @entity120 has no independent means to verify exactly what happened			0
" the narrative emerging from @entity97 was that @entity11 used the cease - fire as cover to attack the soldiers in the tunnel			1
@entity127 press secretary @entity157 and @entity86 deputy national security adviser @entity158 used this same language in remarks friday			0
@entity157 called the turn of events " rather barbaric			0
" but the military wing of @entity11 disputes that			0
according to the @entity66 , they carried out an attack on @entity9 troops before the cease - fire took effect			1
in a statement , the group mentions that @entity9 soldiers were killed as a result of the battle , but does not mention the capture of a soldier			1
a second @entity11 spokesman said @entity9 broke the friday cease - fire before and after the hiatus by advancing its forces near civilian areas in @entity21 and by occupying civilian homes to use as sniper positions			1
1 killed in @entity185 protest before the cease - fire plan was announced , @entity9 prime minister @entity186 had said @entity9 troops would continue destroying @entity11 ' network of tunnels that run under the border into @entity9 with or without a truce			1
@entity38 , the @entity11 spokesman , said that this part of the truce was not communicated to his group			0
he said @entity11 ' understanding was that there would be no military activity at all			0
a @entity120 spokesman said it was very clear the @entity9 's would continue destroying the tunnels			2
" perhaps some will deny that now , " said @entity202 , undersecretary - general for public affairs			0
" but , yes , it was very clear in the diplomacy being done yesterday			0
... the @entity9 never ceased saying that			0
" inside a @entity11 tunnel what is @entity11 ' endgame in @entity0 ? what is @entity9 's endgame in @entity0 ? the conflict has caused outrage around the world , including in the @entity7 @entity185 , where thousands protested on friday			1
one @entity7 was killed in @entity220 during clashes with the @entity9 military , @entity7 paramedics told @entity1			1
the @entity224 world has been accused of being silent on the @entity0 conflict , but @entity227 's @entity226 on friday released a statement condemning the violence			0
palestinians " are being subjected to mass massacres and crimes against humanity without any humane or moral grounds to the point that terrorism has taken different forms , " @entity226 said			0
" especially the state sponsored terrorism which is the most dangerous form			0
" @entity11 has said it wants an end to @entity9 's blockade on @entity0 , which restricts the movement of goods and people			0
it also wants the release of prisoners detained by the @entity9			0
@entity9 , meanwhile , says it is aiming for the demilitarization of @entity11 - controlled @entity0 , removing the threat that militant weapons pose to @entity9 civilians			1
opinion : @entity0 peace struggle drains me of hope what you need to know about the @entity9 - @entity11 @entity257 @entity1 's @entity258 and @entity259 reported and wrote the story in @entity261			2
@entity1 's @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed from @entity0			0
@entity1 's @entity31 , @entity265 and @entity266 contributed from @entity267			0
@entity1 's @entity268 and @entity269 contributed to this report .			0
