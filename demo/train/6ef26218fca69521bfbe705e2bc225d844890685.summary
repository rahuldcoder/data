@entity1 ' life as a dancer was shattered last year at the @entity4 bombings			1
she and her husband @entity5 , who had just returned from a tour in @entity7 with the @entity8 , were steps away from the second blast			2
" i felt the direct impact and it immediately blew off ( part of ) my left foot , " she said			1
before @entity1 could even see the damage the bomb had done , her husband 's reaction confirmed her fears			1
" i remember him picking up my foot and looking and just screaming a scream that you never want to hear a loved one scream , " she recalled			2
@entity24 also sustained injuries -- shrapnel wounds to both legs were causing blood loss -- but he knew it was his wife 's much more traumatic injury that could quickly kill her			1
" i took my belt off and put it around @entity1 's leg			1
at that point i remember thinking this is very ironic			2
for 4Â½ months , i had a real tourniquet on my arm every day ... in @entity7 , " he said			2
" when did i need it ? back at home			2
" minutes later , first responders rushed @entity42 into an ambulance and raced to @entity44			2
while her life was saved by the heroic actions of her husband , emergency personnel and doctors , the damage to her foot was so severe that surgeons had no choice but to amputate			2
she woke up the next day in the hospital in a haze , with phantom pains in her foot			2
she believed it had been saved			2
her mother had to deliver the heart - breaking news			2
" she looked at me and said , ' @entity1 , you do n't have a foot			1
your foot is gone , ' " she said			2
" i just lost it			1
it was really hard to hear			2
" the loss of a limb would be agonizing for anyone but for @entity1 , it was the end of her way of life			1
she is an award - winning ballroom dancer whose passion for dance is contagious			2
" dancing is the one thing i do that when i do it , i do n't feel like i should be doing anything else ever			0
i feel so free , " she said			0
her dream was to continue teaching ballroom dancing in @entity85 and competing in higher levels of dance tournaments across the country			0
" when she dances , i see her glow			0
i see her light up ... then all of a sudden , ( to ) have it removed in a split second is devastating , " said @entity24			0
" i knew that there was a chance that she 'd never dance again			0
" ' i thought everybody had a bomb ' from the early days of her recovery , @entity1 was defiant towards her new life as an amputee			1
speaking to @entity103 's @entity102 just a week after the bombings , she vowed that she would dance again			1
" i feel like somebody has come along and said , ' oh , we 're not going to let you do that anymore , ' " she said			0
" i 'm going to prove them wrong			0
" @entity1 agreed to allow @entity103 to follow her journey to recovery and film her everyday life over the past year			1
she details her recovery on @entity103 's " @entity114 " on april 8 at 10 p.m. et. her video diaries portray a raw , honest and at times heart - breaking picture of a woman battling extreme physical and emotional challenges			1
" the reality of knowing that someone tried to kill you and letting that sink in ... it 's just been really difficult , " she said in one video			1
" i have gone through many , many stages , of not only @entity126 , but also of mourning the loss of my leg , " she said			1
" i remember waking up many mornings and just bawling and just crying and just being so sad			0
" the mental scars , especially in the early months , were never far from the surface			0
" navigating the streets of @entity85 for the first time , it was really tough , " said @entity1			1
" i thought everybody had a bomb			0
i mean i hate even saying things like that out loud because it sounds crazy but ... i had horrible anxiety			0
" that 's evident in one video that shows @entity1 ' reaction to a fireworks show outside the couple 's apartment			1
" i thought we were going to die , " she said			0
" i hit the floor immediately and put my hands over my head and started screaming and crying and called 911			0
" beyond the anguish she battled mentally , the physical challenges of walking and eventually dancing again were extreme			0
" i was very uneducated about prosthetics and it was a huge surprise and complete , not only disappointment , but devastation that i could n't just put on a prosthetic and just walk and go			0
i did n't know it would be so incredibly painful , " she said			0
it would be months of intense physical therapy before @entity1 trusted her leg enough to try dancing again			1
her muscle memory from dancing as many as 60 hours a week before her amputation was still there , but her prosthetic did n't respond as her natural leg had			1
unlike the repetitive motion of walking or running , the complicated and varied movements of ballroom dancing are nearly impossible on a standard prosthetic			0
a new start just as @entity1 ' frustration with dancing began to overwhelm her , she connected with the man that would eventually put her back on the dance floor			1
dr. @entity181 is one of the world 's leading creators of bionic prosthetic limbs as director of the @entity186 at the @entity187 he is also an amputee , having lost both of his legs in an ice climbing accident as a teenager			1
after meeting @entity1 , @entity181 pledged to help her recapture her dream			1
" i really emotionally connect with @entity1 's mission to dance again			1
and i wanted do everything i could to help her achieve that goal , " said @entity181			0
but the doctor and his team had a massive challenge -- they 'd have to create the world 's first bionic leg designed specifically for dancing			1
" we 're going to measure everything about the dance -- the movements , the forces , " said @entity181			0
he and his team brought one of @entity1 ' fellow dancers into their lab and placed super sensitive sensors on her body while she danced some of @entity1 ' favorite dance steps			1
" we have to use ... artificial type intelligence , " he said			0
" @entity218 built into the bionic limb has to understand fundamentally the nature of the dance			0
" video : meet @entity181 , creator of the most advanced bionic leg @entity181 and his team spent months developing the bionic limb and when it was ready to be worn , @entity1 spent countless hours in their lab testing it and giving them feedback			1
when she felt strong enough , she invited @entity102 to @entity187 to show him how far she 'd come			0
in just eight months since they first met , @entity1 overcame seemingly overwhelming odds and made good on her promise to give @entity102 a dance lesson			1
" i had no doubt that @entity1 had the will to do it and would dance again , " said @entity102			1
" she was very kind in trying to help me dance			0
i think i need a lot more work than she does in that area			0
" @entity102 on @entity1 's story @entity243 continued hard work to return to the level of dancing she attained before the bombing , @entity1 has now become an advocate for other amputees			1
" i feel really passionately about the rights of amputees as well as the advancements in prosthetics , " she said			0
" i know that the only thing that makes me disabled is not the fact that i do n't have two feet , it 's the fact that what i 'm using is n't advanced enough to make me do the same thing that the person next to me with two feet can do			2
" @entity1 sees her participation in this @entity103 documentary as a way to reach out to other amputees and help them through their own dark days			1
" i know that i 'm not inspired by the amputee that 's standing on top of the mountain or the amputee that crossed the finish line			2
i 'm inspired by the struggle and the journey it took to get there , " she said			0
perhaps @entity1 ' biggest message is that she never wants to be pitied or to be called a victim of the people that carried out the @entity85 bombings			1
" a victim ... means that i somehow belong to somebody or i 'm suffering because of him and i 'm not suffering			0
i 'm thriving , " she said			0
" i am a survivor			0
