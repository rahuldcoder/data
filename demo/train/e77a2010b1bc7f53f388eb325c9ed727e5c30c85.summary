@entity0 -- @entity2 is in the fast lane			1
the trillion - plus - dollar economy , @entity6 's largest after @entity4 and @entity5 , is set to host the world 's fastest sport this weekend			2
the subcontinent 's inaugural @entity10 comes barely a year after @entity2 earned international scorn for all the chaos and corruption allegations that plagued the @entity15 staged in @entity0			1
that event was marred by a host of problems including athletes ' alarm over the shoddy construction and condition of their quarters , while a pedestrian bridge leading to the main @entity25 collapsed two days before the competitors were due to arrive			0
in april this year , @entity2 's federal police arrested the @entity29 ' chief organizer , @entity28 , for suspected corruption			1
@entity28 , who was involved in bringing @entity31 to @entity2 through his former role at the @entity33 , was jailed for allegedly buying a time , scoring and result system from a @entity36 company at inflated costs			1
he was also suspended by the political party with which he was an mp			0
but promoters of @entity2 's first @entity31 race hope their $ 400 million project will repair the damage done to the country 's reputation			1
" the world 's perception of @entity2 is going to change after the @entity10 and people will forget what happened because of the @entity29 , " said @entity45 , founding chairman of @entity46 that built the @entity47			1
a few weeks ago , a fleet of @entity54 cars whizzed media crews around the 5.125 - kilometer circuit , giving them a glimpse of what @entity2 businesses lauded as a stirring example of their competence			2
" @entity64 is completely capable , and they are capable of executing projects of world class , which has been demonstrated by the @entity31 track , which looks certainly as one of the best in the world , " said @entity62 , a senior director with the @entity63			2
" this is great news for the country because the investors are also now excited that this is the country where , you know , all the happening things are happening , " he told @entity1			0
@entity62 's lobby group predicts that investments in the motorsport infrastructure could potentially fuel overall economic prosperity by some $ 10 billion over the next decade			0
it says the arrival of global sporting bodies -- themselves seeking a foothold in emerging markets -- is an ideal opportunity for international brand - building by @entity2 businesses			2
however , not everyone is as excited about the event when so many @entity2 live in abject poverty			2
" the contrast between the rich and the poor is very large in @entity2 , " said @entity92 , a professor at the @entity93 at @entity0 's @entity94			1
" here , about 40 % of our people live in extreme poverty without even basic facilities			0
in a sense , it sounds very cruel that the nation is spending a large amount of its wealth on such sports			0
" the track complex , complete with stands and team enclosures painted in the colors of @entity2 's flag , was built by private developers on land acquired from farmers , who later alleged they were short - changed for their properties			1
last week , the country 's @entity116 froze 25 % of ticket revenue after a litigant challenged government tax waivers on the race			1
critics are questioning the taste of putting up such high - octane shows in a country where a quarter of its billion - plus people still lives on less than a dollar a day			0
with organizers struggling to sell out the event , ticket prices for sunday 's race have already been slashed			1
the most expensive has dropped from $ 715 to about $ 300 , and the cheapest from about $ 120 to $ 60			0
but even the lowest amount is equivalent to the monthly wages of tens of thousands of @entity2			2
" what do we consider to be a nation ? a nation means having a concern for all citizens			0
in this day and age when advertising has become so large , expectations have risen and these lavish displays only increase discontent , " @entity92 said			0
" and the ruling elite in the country is backing such displays , which shows it 's becoming more callous			0
" in cricket - crazy @entity2 , some also accept that motorsport , though exciting , is too new to them			0
" i do n't think we @entity2 are much into formula racing , " admits @entity152 , a @entity0 resident			1
" and i guess how the race is being done , who wins it , what the rules are and who the teams are have to be known to the @entity2 public			1
i 'm talking of the masses , not just the elite			0

@entity2 hosts a @entity31 race for the first time this weekend , near @entity0
organizers hoping to *overcome* the legacy of the 2010 @entity29
venue was built on land bought from farmers , who have been *unhappy* with deal
ticket prices for sunday 's race have been slashed to *attract* more local *supporters*
