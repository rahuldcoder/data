-- last week , the @entity1 dealt parents , teachers and the education world a serious blow			2
according to its latest test results , " sat reading scores for the high school class of 2011 were the lowest on record , and combined reading and math scores fell to their lowest point since 1995			1
" the reading scores , which stand at 497 , are noticeably lower than just six years ago , when they stood at 508			1
and it 's just the second time in the last 20 years that reading scores have dropped so precipitously in a single year			1
yet , according to the @entity1 , there is no reason to panic			0
the results , they say , " reflect the record size and diversity of the pool of test - takers			1
as more students aim for college and take the exam , it tends to drag down average scores			1
" since when has diversity and more students taking the test become a legitimate excuse for bad scores ? a conservative certainly could not get away with blaming falling test scores on diversity			1
increased diversity and student participation are very good things , but we should not console ourselves with excuses for falling scores , especially considering the amount of money we spend each year on education			2
the 2011 budget for the @entity48 is estimated to top $ 70 billion , while overall spending on public elementary and secondary education is about $ 600 billion a year			0
by comparison , in 1972 , before the @entity48 even existed , sat critical reading scores for college - bound seniors were above 525 , more than 20 points higher than they are today , while today 's math scores are only slightly better than in 1972			1
as the @entity58 increases education spending , our students ' scores should not be getting worse			0
for a long time , i , along with other conservative reformers , have been saying that real reform means more than throwing money at the problem			0
now , an unexpected voice from across the political spectrum is agreeing			0
@entity67 , founder of @entity69 and @entity71 magazine , and author of the new book " @entity74 : inside the fight to fix @entity58 's schools , " has turned the journalistic magnifying glass on the nation 's public schools and teachers ' unions			0
@entity67 's book is one of the most in - depth and closely researched looks into the modern workings of the education " blob " in recent memory			0
and @entity67 is a liberal , a very thoughtful and careful liberal , and he is criticizing the heart of liberal power : the teachers ' unions			0
@entity67 closely traces the modern education reform movement from @entity94 , to @entity95 , to @entity96 , to such high - profile reformers as @entity98 and @entity99 , while lamenting obvious long - standing barriers to educational improvement such as the " last in , first out " policy that requires teachers to be laid off based purely on seniority rather than performance			1
@entity67 scours the inner workings of public school teachers ' contracts , uncovering such gems as a @entity112 contract provision " allowing the principal no say over the format of a lesson plan			1
" he recounts his exposure of @entity112 's infamous " rubber rooms , " where hundreds of teachers under investigation for misconduct or incompetence were sidelined for years at full pay with nothing to do but watch the clock tick down each day			2
the practice was discontinued after his reporting revealed it			0
in another illustrative case study , @entity67 compares @entity128 , a charter school , with @entity129 149 , a traditional public school			0
both schools happen to share the same building in @entity112 , with very similar students , parents , socioeconomic conditions and environments			0
but @entity128 blows @entity137 149 out of the water			0
eighty - six percent of its students were proficient in @entity141 in 2010 , compared with 29 % of @entity137 's			0
throughout the book , @entity67 uses examples like these to explain how fossilized teacher union contracts , lax or nonexistent teacher evaluations , and unmovable wages and benefits have straitjacketed any hope of real reform			1
the solution , @entity67 says , is to overhaul the public school education system in order to motivate and inspire better teachers			2
rewriting union contracts and paying teachers based on performance , not seniority , are among the first steps @entity67 advises			1
the @entity58 can afford to pay our nation 's best teachers more , while holding bad teachers accountable and paying them accordingly			1
@entity67 's work represents a real tug - of - war inside the @entity166 , between the teachers ' unions and modern reformers , for control of the nation 's education machine			2
the old guard of the @entity166 , the @entity173 and @entity174 , believe that the blame for stagnant and falling test scores falls on anyone but them			2
yet , new @entity166 voices , such as @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity98 , are vocally questioning what was once unquestionable -- that contracts , wages , benefits , accountability and standards need sensible reforms			0
the latest drop in @entity192 reading scores should not be written off as a statistical outlier , but should be a wake - up call to heed the chorus of reformers , conservatives and liberals alike , whose prescriptions are timely , relevant and might be just what we need to turn our public schools around			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			2

@entity205 : @entity192 reading scores for 2011 high school class were lowest on record
@entity205 : college board blames record numbers and diversity of test - takers , but this is no excuse
he says some *democrats* agree that contracts , teacher performance need reform
we can afford to pay best teachers more , if worst are held accountable , @entity205 says
