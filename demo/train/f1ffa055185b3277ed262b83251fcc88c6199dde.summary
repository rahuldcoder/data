-- @entity2 's profession is not one that people go to college for			1
it 's also not work that gets easier with time			2
her job is to help you die a " good death			2
" her definition of " good " goes like this : a death in which a person 's wishes for the end of his or her life are respected and carriecd out			1
no matter what those wishes are			2
she found herself in this role because of what she perceives as a great need in @entity26 to make discussions about death more a part of life			1
because no one likes to talk about this stuff			0
more than a quarter of @entity26 said they have given no thought or not very much thought to their wishes for dying , a 2013 @entity38 survey found			1
only a third said they have put their wishes in writing , something that @entity2 knows to be vital in the middle of the most excruciating circumstances			1
from 9 to 5 , in the @entity46 , @entity47 , offices of the end - of - life advocacy group @entity49 , @entity2 and her staff field up to 100 calls a day			1
the number of those calls has swollen after the death last week of @entity54 , who had terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life with a fatal dose of barbiturates at age 29			1
@entity60 was very public about why she chose to end her life			1
" because the rest of my body is young and healthy , i am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind , " she wrote in a @entity0 opinion piece			0
" i probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months			0
and my family would have had to watch that			0
" i did not want this nightmare scenario for my family , so i started researching death with dignity			2
" @entity49 partnered with @entity60 and issued a statement saying that she " died as she intended -- peacefully in her bedroom , in the arms of her loved ones			0
" others choose not to die like that			0
and that 's ok with @entity2			1
she 's had people tell her that they have the best benefits in the world , and they want to keep trying everything medically possible until the very end			1
@entity2 , 58 , previously was a mental health counselor and educator and has been an end - of - life consultant for the last seven years			1
her goal is to make people aware of their options			1
she became more keenly aware of how tough things can get when her mother was dying of lung cancer in 1990			2
" we took our cue from her , " @entity2 says			1
" she had very pronounced ideas of how she wanted to go			0
" much of it was generational			0
@entity2 's mother was from an era when people rarely listened to anything but doctor 's orders			1
she entered a hospice and in the end , she suffered a great deal			0
@entity2 says that had she known then what she knows now , she might have brought up other options for her mother			1
" most people say , ' i 'm not afraid to die			0
i am afraid to suffer , ' " she says			0
" or they say , ' i 've had a good life but i do n't want my illness to compromise my loved one 's memories			1
' it 's very well thought out for these people			1
" @entity2 has a list of questions she asks her clients , which she prefers to call them rather than patients			2
do you have an advance directive ? that 's a legal document that outlines a person 's wishes at the end of life			1
one of her clients told her that she wanted very much to discuss her choices with her children but they refused to talk about their mom 's death			1
so her client invited the whole family for @entity142 and when they sat down to dinner , each one found her advanced directive sitting on their plates			0
" no one eats , " said the client , " until you 've read this			0
" @entity2 first assesses a client 's situation -- mobility , support system , treatment -- and then continues with tough questions			1
do you want to have a feeding tube ? do you want to be kept on a ventilator ? do you want chemotherapy ? do you want to be put into a medical coma if no amount of medication can relieve your pain ? do you realize that one outcome of a medical coma could be your death ? are your family members supportive of your wishes ? sometimes a client will say that one of her children opposes her wish to die on religious or moral grounds			2
@entity2 lets those clients know that they can specify which relatives will have the right to carry out end - of - life decisions			1
one of her colleagues currently is counseling a client with @entity183 's disease , also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity185 , which affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord			0
the client 's only way of communication is using one finger to text			0
his spouse conducts conference calls with their children and with the end - of - life counselor who acts as a subjective third party			1
recently , the counselor discovered that the family had put her client on a feeding tube , even though an advanced directive underscored : " no feeding tube			0
" " my colleague asked the very question the family did not want to ask the patient : ' do you really want this feeding tube ? according to everything you have declared up to this point , you do n't want this			0
have you changed your mind ? ' " the client said , " no. " " it was a difficult conversation but a necessary one , " @entity2 says			1
" they all knew what the answer was but it was so hard in their hearts			0
" another time , a client called @entity2 to say her doctor had recommended radiation			2
" tell me again how old you are , " @entity2 said			2
" 97 , " the client replied			0
you are 97 and the doctor told you to go through this ? " that 's when she advised her client of other options , though she never tells anyone what they ought to do			0
" my job is to educate , to empower , " @entity2 says			2
" i am glad the conversation has been elevated in the public consciousness			0
" @entity54 moved with her husband to @entity46 because @entity47 is one of five states that recognize aid in dying as lawful medical practice			1
among the 40 other states that are addressing " assisted suicide , " 38 criminalize it			0
@entity2 takes issue with the term " assisted suicide			2
" many people who commit suicide are physically healthy , she says , while her clients are terminally ill people taking control of their death			2
polls show that most @entity26 support @entity60 's decision and favor a full consideration of end - of - life options			1
about six in 10 @entity26 believe people suffering a great deal of pain with no hope of getting better have a moral right to end their lives , according to @entity38			1
that 's up from 55 % in 1990			0
and most adults in @entity26 said there are at least some situations in which they , personally , would want to halt medical treatment and be allowed to die , according to @entity38			2
but about a third responded that they would tell their doctors to do everything possible to keep them alive			0
@entity38 found that personal preferences are linked to religious affiliations			0
many people believe that no one but @entity279 has the right to make a life or death decision			1
the @entity284 , for instance , has guidelines on end - of - life decisions and forbids actions that are considered immoral by the church , including euthanasia and doctor - assisted death			1
others believe feeling pain can be spiritually cleansing and redemptive , @entity2 says			2
" i do n't get this , but some people think suffering is character building and they really want to suffer , " she says			0
and that , too , can be a good death			0
follow @entity0 's @entity300 on @entity301 @entity302 to die ? read about families from @entity304 to @entity305 who were forced , by unlucky fate or divine providence , not only to articulate an answer , but to carry it out .			0

@entity2 works as an end - of - life counselor
she wants to make sure people know they have choices at the end of their lives
study : more than a quarter of @entity26 have given little or no thought about wishes for dying
@entity54 's death has helped spark a national conversation
