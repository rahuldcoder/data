@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been a while since i 've enjoyed going to church so much			1
the @entity6 of @entity7 is still a major attraction for pilgrims			2
as a lapsed @entity10 i tend to keep my church attendances to @entity12 and , if i 'm feeling quite a lot of guilt , @entity14			2
however , i would happily go to " church " at @entity0 's @entity16 on a daily basis			1
a former gothic church and monastery dating from the 15th century , the buildings have been beautifully renovated to welcome disciples of a new kind of religion -- luxury			0
boasting 60 rooms , dazzling but sympathetic light installations and a mezzanine restaurant and accompanying womb - like wine bar in the church 's nave , it 's easy to be quickly converted			1
the food is also pretty good ; my fish and scallops starter followed by venison the perfect communion for a late autumn evening			0
the @entity38 , though , is only one of @entity0 's many gems			1
the southern @entity1 city of 120,000 people does not feature prominently on many lists of must - visit places , but it should			1
an easy train journey from @entity46 and @entity47 and a mid-distance journey from @entity49 , @entity50 and several @entity52 stations , @entity0 is laden with good restaurants ( there are four @entity56 - starred eateries ) , shopping , history , public art and surrounded by pretty villages with woodland walking paths			1
the city center , like a miniature @entity50 , is split in two by the @entity63			1
roman history and a @entity65 featuring boutiques and art galleries dominate the left bank , while on the right the @entity70 -- a contemporary art museum -- and hip retro design shops hold forth			0
the religious theme continues on the left bank at @entity75 -- yet another church that has been converted , this time into a fabulous @entity78 - and @entity1 - language book store			1
originally built in the 13th century by the @entity83 order , its most recent use before 2007 's spectacular renovation was as an indoor bike pound			0
it now features a three - story black steel bookstack in the high nave , together with a noisy cafe in the choir			0
if it sounds like desecration , you could n't be more wrong			0
it is a book and architecture lover 's heaven on @entity96			2
as proud locals tell my wife and me , there are plenty of empty churches in the area that could do with a similar makeover			2
book browsing is hungry and thirsty work , but there are plenty of options for a prolonged stop : pull up a chair at one of the many cafes that surround the city 's squares or head for the @entity118 underground food hall			1
typically food halls give me the willies ; bad food cooked hours earlier , reheated and served up for the masses			0
the @entity118 is the complete opposite			0
it gathers high - end outlets together , giving you the chance to take away delicious food or eat in and watch your meal being prepared in the open kitchens			0
if it 's more traditional @entity131 - influenced food with a tasty flourish you are after , then head for the welcoming @entity136 on the @entity137 , one of the city 's oldest streets			2
refueled and clearly with a blessed life to give thanks for , we stop off at a church that is still used for its original purpose			0
the imposing @entity6 of @entity7 , originally founded in the 6th century , is the oldest church in @entity1 , though it was substantially rebuilt and enlarged between the 11th and 15th centuries			1
@entity7 , responsible for spreading @entity10 to the @entity148 and a diplomat in the fourth century , is buried in the crypt and his relics ( i.e. bits of his bone fragment ) spookily feature in the basilica 's treasury			0
in times of distress , his relics were carried around the town -- a procession which is now carried out every seven years			0
the cathedral draws many pilgrims , with pope @entity164 once a visitor in 1984			0
having given our praise we make a quick stop at @entity0 's ceramic museum , where the brilliant @entity171 photo exhibition is in residence			1
the museum , a stone 's throw from the river , is surrounded by tasteful inner - city apartments and close to the striking @entity70 , where art works by modern and old masters find a comfortable home together			2
unfortunately , it 's a bit too early for us to be eating again , so we return to our hotel and the countryside around the village of @entity187 -- a 10 - minute train ride outside @entity0			1
local residents are out running and cycling , while others walk their dogs to the nearest pub ; everyone says hello			0
the area is dotted with caves , some of which were once inhabited and a few can be toured			2
across the road from our hotel , @entity201 , is the entrance to @entity203 -- a series of caves it uses as a restaurant and to host functions for as many as 400 people			1
in a way , the caves are a metaphor for @entity0 ; its delights may have been a secret for some time , but it 's a pilgrimage well worth making .			1

@entity0 , a southern @entity1 city , is full of *fantastic* restaurants and sights
former churches have been converted into a restaurant and book store
caves used to host functions for up to 400 people
