-- @entity1 says " keep calm and shut the bleep up			0
" the witty @entity4 writer is sick of what she calls " self - indulgent vicarious trauma " following the blasts at the marathon finish line in @entity9 last week , which killed three people , injured more than 100 and set off a manhunt that left an @entity13 cop dead			1
" you do n't need to keep changing your @entity16 status to let us all know that you 're still extremely shocked and sad about the @entity9 bombing , " she wrote last week			1
" let 's just stipulate that everyone is shocked and sad , except the perpetrators and some other scattered sociopaths			0
" @entity23 : run for @entity9 part of me loves her piece			1
it 's a worthy critique of the faux - concern and needless commercialism that can grow out of tragedy			0
but i think @entity33 is selling people short by writing that " there just is n't much most ordinary people should do in immediate response to events such as the @entity9 bombings			1
" there 's plenty to do , as runners have shown in the week since the bombing			1
within hours of the blasts , people all over the world were lacing up their running shoes and going outside to run			1
it 's a simple , selfish act			0
some did it to clear their heads			0
others to process what had just happened to fellow runners and those cheering them on			2
i did it because i felt like i just needed to do something			0
and i feel all the more compelled to keep training because of inspirational stories like those of @entity61 , a dance instructor who lost her foot in the bombing but vows to dance and run again			1
on their own , none of these runs means much			0
but when people started sharing their stories on @entity71 with the hashtag # runforboston , they took on a greater significance			2
the collective runs started to feel like a form of protest -- a global show of solidarity with victims and a middle finger to violence and its perpetrators			2
some runners started raising money for charity or to help with relief efforts			2
others , like @entity88 , from @entity89 , who started a website for people to log the miles they were running for @entity9 ( more than 4,000 runs have been logged so far ) , wanted @entity9 's victims , some of whom were robbed of their legs and possibly their abilities to run , that the world was thinking of them			1
@entity100 : why i 'm running for @entity9 perhaps that 's childish and naive , but i do think that matters			1
that 's why @entity23 is asking runners and would - be runners to sign up to run a race -- maybe a marathon ? -- as a show of solidarity with , and support for , the victims of the @entity9 bombing			1
more than 250 people have signed up to run a race			2
they 're from @entity9 , @entity89 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			2
some are raising money for charity with an app called @entity123			0
others are running because of personal connections to @entity9 , because they felt the bombing was an attack on runners everywhere , or because they were moved by a particular story			1
" i refuse to forget what i witness , " wrote @entity130 , 28 , who lives near the site of the bombing in @entity9			1
" let 's reclaim our city , " wrote @entity133 , a 45 - year - old from @entity135			0
" i 'd like to show marathon runners and those watching that i 'm inspired by so many of them , " wrote @entity139 , a 27 - year - old who works in @entity9			1
" as runners , we are resilient by nature , " wrote @entity143 , 29 , from @entity144			0
all of them have pledged to run a race as a way to work through the tragedy			0
i 'd encourage you to join in			0
i 'm going to run a marathon by next april as part of this run for @entity9 project			1
and if you 'd like to sign up , you have until may 1 to do so			0
all you have to do is take a picture of your sneakers and tell us a little bit about why you 're running			0
we 'll post new instructions and challenges in the weeks ahead			2
on the one - month anniversary of the bombing , may 15 , we 're going to ask @entity166 to host group runs all over the country and world in honor and remembrance of those who died and were injured in @entity9			1
got questions ? feel free to ask them in the comments			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity100 .			0
