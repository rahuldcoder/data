-- outside the windows of a @entity4 cargo plane , the ocean spreads out in all directions			1
somewhere below , it is believed , are the remains of @entity8 , which disappeared on a journey from @entity10 to @entity11			1
but a sighting has eluded searchers so far , and the mystery surrounding the plane grows			1
" this is still a search and rescue operation as far as the @entity20 government is concerned , " @entity0 's @entity16 said as she accompanied the crew of the @entity4			1
the military plane was flying at just 500 feet above sea level , with searchers peering out the windows			1
all that could be seen on the water were rescue ships , also on the mission			1
search aircraft were covering an area of about 12,500 square nautical miles			1
local fishermen have even been asked to help			2
" crucial time is passing , " @entity33 , with the @entity34 , told @entity0 's @entity31			1
" that search area -- that haystack -- is getting bigger and bigger and bigger			0
" indeed , that search area grew tuesday			0
a senior @entity20 @entity39 official told @entity0 that flight 370 was hundreds of miles off course , traveling in the opposite direction from its original destination and had stopped sending identifying transponder codes before it disappeared			1
if correct , those ominous signs could call into question whether someone in the cockpit might have deliberately steered the plane away from its intended destination , a former @entity53 aviation investigator said			1
" this kind of deviation in course is simply inexplicable , " said @entity54 , former managing director of the @entity55			0
nearly three dozen aircraft and 40 ships from 10 countries have so far failed to find any sign of the aircraft , which took off from @entity10 shortly before 1 a.m. saturday ( noon friday et )			1
the @entity65 was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members			0
@entity33 described what will happen once some debris from the aircraft is found , though he stressed there 's still no evidence the plane hit the water			1
" once a piece of the debris is found -- if it did impact on the water -- then you 've got to backtrack that debris to try to find the ' @entity79 ' on where the plane actually hit the water , because that would be the center of the haystack			1
" and in that haystack you 're trying to find bits of that needle -- in fact , in the case of the flight data recorders , you 're looking for a tiny little bit of that needle , " he said			1
' not hopeless ' according to the @entity20 @entity39 official , who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media , the plane 's transponder apparently stopped working at about the time flight controllers lost contact with it , near the coast of @entity101			1
the @entity20 @entity39 lost track of the plane over @entity105 , a tiny island in the @entity106 -- many hundreds of miles from the usual flight path for aircraft traveling between @entity10 and @entity11 , the official said			1
if data cited by the source is correct , the aircraft was flying away from @entity11 and on the opposite side of the @entity114 from its scheduled route			2
previous accounts had the aircraft losing touch with air traffic control near the coast of @entity101			2
rescue officials have expanded the search area			0
" what i 'm seeing here is clearly they have no idea , " said @entity0 aviation correspondent @entity122			1
" they know roughly the area , but even there they are starting to scrabble around as to -- was it going in this direction ? had it turned round ? " @entity134 described the search as " extremely painstaking work , " suggesting that a grid would have been drawn over the ocean and that teams are combing the area , bit by bit			0
although the work is challenging , he is confident that @entity8 will be found			1
" it 's not hopeless by any means			0
they will find it , " @entity122 said			2
they have to know what happened			0
" @entity53 officials expressed frustration tuesday with the way the search has been handled			0
" to me , every minute counts here			0
and that was such a key point -- that the plane actually reversed course and was flying back over @entity20 toward @entity159			2
why was n't that made known ? why were n't jets scrambled ? why was n't an alert put out on that immediately ? " said rep. @entity162 , chairman of the @entity164 counterterrorism and intelligence subcommittee			0
" so far they seemed to have dropped the ball at every level			2
i hate to be the monday morning quarterback , but it appears as if they 've basically done nothing right so far , " he said			2
@entity176 chairman rep. @entity175 echoed @entity162 's comments when he spoke to @entity0 's @entity178			1
" the @entity20 have not been fully cooperative in making this a scientific search pattern using all the assets very wisely			0
so you start out in one place , and you 're 500 miles away the next day			0
that tells me that they 've got a lot of gaps to try to fill , " he said			2
' still a mystery ' @entity33 , of the @entity34 , speaks from experience			0
he helped lead the search for the recorders of @entity193 , which crashed into the @entity194 in 2009			0
the @entity196 flight was en route from @entity198 to @entity199 when communications ended suddenly from the @entity201 , another state - of - the - art aircraft			2
it took four searches over the course of nearly two years to locate the bulk of @entity193 's wreckage and the majority of the 228 bodies in a mountain range deep under the ocean			0
it took even longer to find the cause of the disaster			2
in 2011 , the aircraft 's voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered from the ocean floor after an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles			2
" in this case , i thought for sure -- in a highly trafficked area where there 's lots of air traffic , lots of ship traffic , not far from shore -- that for sure this would be a more rapid finding of some remnants of the plane -- but nothing , " @entity33 told @entity0 's @entity31 , comparing the @entity221 and @entity196 flights			1
@entity237 of the @entity239 's @entity238 also spoke to @entity31			0
he said the @entity240 of @entity241 is " pretty much saturated , " but that the @entity106 is " not quite " because " it 's harder to get things over there			0
" @entity237 spoke by phone while aboard the @entity246 , which is assisting in the search			0
" it 's not a matter of if we can see something			0
we 've picked up small wooden crates on our radar			1
we 've picked up something as small as a soccer ball or a basketball			1
so we can see if things are out there			0
" now this is @entity239 technology -- not everyone has this same technology , " he said tuesday			0
a day earlier , @entity237 told @entity31 the search area was growing on account of currents and the wind			0
" it 's a very large search area , but still a mystery -- still a lot of question marks			0
" @entity272 ' inclined to conclude ' @entity221 disappearance not terror two mystery passengers add to intrigue in airliner 's disappearance who travels with a stolen passport ? missing @entity8 : what we know and do n't know @entity0 's @entity282 contributed to this report .			1

" we 've picked up something as small as a soccer ball ( on radar ) , " an official says
@entity0 rides along with searchers on plane
@entity8 disappeared four days *ago*
nearly three dozen aircraft and 40 ships have so far failed to find any sign of the aircraft
