@entity0 , @entity1 -- how to make money from ballet is a question puzzling many art executives around the world , but one dance group in @entity1 is hoping that a new initiative will help keep its curtains from closing for good			1
@entity11 ( @entity12 ) is a @entity0 - based professional ballet company comprising both classical and contemporary dancers			1
but it has n't received any government funding for the last 12 years and is struggling to make ends meet			1
@entity19 , ballet mistress at @entity12 , says that running the company with very little financial support is not easy			2
" it 's a fight all the time , " she explains			0
" business is business -- you have to pay the bills , you have to pay the salaries			2
so we have to do whatever it takes to make this business and this product sellable and good			2
" to do exactly that , @entity12 joined forces with students from @entity34 ( @entity34 ) visiting @entity1 as part of their @entity36 , which aims to help @entity34 students increase their practical experience in the business world			1
last month , six business administration students from @entity34 visited @entity12 for two weeks to conduct research and find ways to improve the marketing of the ballet company			1
" it 's a fantastic opportunity for us to really get out into the world and see how people run businesses outside of the classroom , " says @entity45 , one of the students			2
and as the students gain practical experience , the directors of the ballet company gain marketing advice on how to turn their art form into a sustainable business			1
" there are a lot of people out there who are a potential target audience and who are potential target revenue and what 's important is just finding ways of capturing it , " says @entity45			0
" so you 're selling experience , " adds @entity68 , also one of the @entity34 students			1
" it 's not just a posture you 're selling			0
" it 's not about tutus or the shoes or whatever ; it 's this special feeling that you feel when you go see the performance ; it 's about the music , it 's about the whole new world that you see on stage and that 's exactly what you 're selling			0
it 's just the feeling that you get at the theater , so that 's exactly your product			0
" watch video : investing in the arts but apart from simply selling ballet as a product , @entity34 professor @entity93 believes that dance companies have to be business savvy to market professional ballet successfully			1
she says it 's all about taking off your tutu and putting on your business hat			0
" i think that there is a discipline to learning how to run yourself as a business organization that is important for an arts company regardless of whether they have government funding , " says @entity93			1
@entity110 , chief executive of @entity12 , says it costs about $ 2 million to run a ballet company in @entity1 , and ticket sales can not cover all the costs			1
" we recoup about a third of our running costs through ticket sales , " says @entity110			0
for the other two thirds , the ballet company has to rely on generous contributions from @entity11 dance lovers			1
but @entity110 says that this is not enough and not sustainable for a long - term business plan			0
" our product , which in our case is the luxury brand of ballet , needs to be sold like any other product , because by keeping us like an arts company , you literally keep us on our knees , " he says			2
during their stay in @entity1 , the @entity34 students conducted extended interviews with people from all walks of life to find out how to best market ballet			1
@entity45 says they came across genuine excitement for the art form , even in unexpected places , where people little disposable income			0
" when we went out to different areas of @entity0 , certainly to some of the areas like @entity147 , where we were n't expecting to find people who would be really interested in coming to see something that perhaps people have a preconceived notion is a @entity151 art form , and what was striking was that a number of those people felt that they would actually be very happy to come and see the ballet , to buy tickets , " he explains			2
" they were n't afraid of the cost of coming			0
" @entity45 adds : " it was a very aspirational product for them and the biggest issue was one around transport and whether or not they 'll be able to get here			0
so it was not so much that they were n't interested , it was just that they did n't necessarily know of the way to come to the performances or know when the performances were on			0
" one way of combating these issues , @entity45 says , is by taking the ballet to the people			0
" it 's also time that we move out of our comfort zones in the big theaters and that we actually start touring again , " he says			0
" that we take the ballet to the army , to farmers to the plants of big big companies and businesses , to the real man on the street and to get them to appreciate the beauty and wonder of ballet			2
" business advice given , lessons learned , this collaboration between @entity34 's best and @entity12 may just be what the @entity11 ballet company needs to keep its dancers on stage .			1
