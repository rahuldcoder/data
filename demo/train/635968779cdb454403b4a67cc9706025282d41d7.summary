@entity1 , who only recently returned from an achilles injury sustained while on loan at @entity13 giants @entity12 , continued to play despite the strain he picked up early in the match at the @entity2 's @entity17 stadium			1
a first half goal from @entity20 @entity19 was added to in the second period by strikes from 23 - year - old @entity23 and @entity25 @entity24 to give @entity26 the win , a result which ended @entity2 's hopes of winning a third @entity9 cup			1
" it 's just disappointing we 've gone out the way we 've gone out , " @entity1 told the league 's official website			1
" [ in the ] first two minutes , i pulled my abductor			2
it wore off a little , but obviously had nothing to do with our loss			0
" former @entity42 national team coach @entity5 admitted he was aware of the injury and had considered substituting the 35 - year - old , but he decided against it and went on to praise the attitude of his star player			2
" we saw in the very beginning of the game probably 15 minutes in , he had a problem			2
he hung in there , " said @entity5			0
" if we have all of our players with his kind of character and commitment , we would continue to do well			0
" team - captain @entity59 revealed the former @entity61 midfielder has been playing through the pain barrier for sometime			2
" he has n't been at full strength since he 's been back			0
when you come back that quickly at that age from an @entity68 injury , there are going to be residual effects			0
" my hat 's off to him			0
he played through a lot of pain those last few weeks , more than you guys know , but he 's a competitor and he wants to keep going			0
" @entity1 's earlier ankle injury destroyed his dreams of playing for @entity79 in the @entity80 , but he has played the full 90 minutes in four of @entity2 ' last five games since his return to the team			1
@entity26 will now compete in the final championship game -- the decider for the @entity9 title -- against @entity87 , who beat @entity89 1 - 0 in the @entity90 final thanks to a goal from @entity93			1
