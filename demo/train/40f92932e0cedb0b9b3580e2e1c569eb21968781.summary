@entity2 boy , that escalated quickly			0
a collection of @entity6 pacs meant to give the party 's presumptive front - runner @entity7 a solid foundation for launching a campaign is experiencing its first fracture in what has been so far a unified front			2
one of the group 's central figures , @entity16 , resigned monday from a super @entity5 board with a scathing email accusing his colleagues of " specious and malicious " attacks on his credibility			2
the @entity23 board has long been seen as the hub of pro-clinton group coordinating and the rift gave @entity28 opponents fresh ammunition to remind the public of campaign infighting from 2008 and worried supporters who feared the return of staffing turmoil that led to the last campaign 's implosion			1
the public dispute between super pacs is an anomaly for five political groups that , until now , have presented a largely lockstep march behind @entity28 , sliding into place since she left the @entity44 in 2013			1
and while the web has not always been harmonious -- some close to @entity23 tried to sink @entity48 early on in the group 's founding -- it has worked effectively and helped ice some of the field that could challenge @entity28			1
but the now public rift put that into question causing some @entity6 unaffected by the fighting to question why these seasoned operatives let things play out so publicly			1
a key problem for the @entity60 groups -- and by extension @entity28 -- is that each of these organizations were conceived to play a specific role that relied on each other to do it 's job			1
for example , @entity67 , a @entity16 run group , is compiling a wealth of opposition research on republicans that are likely to run for president in 2016			0
that information was going to be used in the fundraising and ad buying efforts run by priorities			0
but with still simmering tension , it is unclear how those roles will continue to be filled			1
the split between @entity16 and @entity23 began after the @entity83 published a story last week examining @entity16 's fundraising practices			0
the piece questioned his relationship with @entity89 @entity88 and the fact she receives over 12 % of all money she raises for @entity16 - tied groups			0
in the letter @entity16 defended his fundraising practices and called the @entity83 story " an orchestrated political hit job			0
" the issue is that @entity16 's resignation from the @entity78 board does n't mean he is no longer involved in the @entity60 movement			1
he still leads two of these groups : correct the @entity103 , a communications and rapid response organization , and @entity67 , an opposition research firm that tracks @entity107 candidates and builds research books to help the @entity28 effort			1
then there is @entity23 , the big money wing of the web , with deep ties to @entity28 , and plans to use large sums of money to run ads against @entity107			1
the two groups that were seemingly left out of the recent infighting were ready for @entity7 , the grassroots arm of the @entity60 outside group world , and @entity122 , a group focused on electing women candidates and , by extension , @entity7			1
the meeting point for all these groups was supposed to be the @entity23 board , which brought together stakeholders from each @entity60 group and operated as a forum to coordinate efforts			1
" if you look at our board , the @entity78 board , that is coordination incarnate , " said a @entity23 source in early 2014			0
" some operatives inside the @entity60 world tried on tuesday to stress that things were on the mend , even if @entity16 and his former @entity23 board were still separated			1
" bumps in the road happen , " said one @entity6 source with knowledge of the super pac fall - out			0
" at the end of the day , the top focus is getting @entity7 elected to be the next president and all the groups are going to keep working together			0
" " we are moving forward , " the source reiterated			0
but that does n't seem to be the whole story as bad blood between @entity6 operatives played out in major news outlets on tuesday and wednesday			0
the rift comes down to money and the jockeying for positions that was expected to take place as the all - but - certain @entity28 campaign began to kick into gear			1
as part of the fallout , sources have begun to talk about fundraising woes at @entity23 and concerns that the group will not be able to compete with the fundraising prowess on the right -- a claim a source at @entity23 vehemently disputed			0
while it 's not just @entity6 that experience staffing shake - ups especially in the early days of the campaign -- @entity180 's pac chief technology officer resigned tuesday -- the clinton - land break up , and attempted public makeup , left some democrats questioning whether the pro-clinton groups were truly united and gave many political watchers flashbacks to the quarreling that defined @entity28 's failed 2008 run			1
what 's more , the infighting reminded many political watchers of @entity28 's 2008 campaign , when public squabbling among top - level operatives defined the former first lady 's fall from frontrunner to failed candidate			1
from the start of the 2008 campaign , @entity28 advisers were at odds with how to portray the candidate			2
should she be tough and go after then - senator @entity204 , who quickly took over the second place slot behind @entity28 in polls ? or does she take a softer side to combating the rising challenger ? strategists on the campaign disagreed and the rifts , which as first played out in private , went public quickly			1
just like seven years ago , the right seized on the discord this week			0
on monday , conservative outlets painted the fighting as yet another chapter in clinton - land drama and the @entity218 peppered reporters with links to stories about the fighting			0
" @entity225 , " blared the @entity224 headline			0
recognizing the message war , @entity16 and former @entity229 gov. @entity228 , co-chairwoman of @entity23 , issued a joint statement on monday , hours after the letter went public , that pledged to work on their issues			2
democrats close to the situation said the conciliatory statements were honest , and both @entity16 and @entity228 , but tensions are still simmering			2
despite all of the friction , many @entity6 operatives said day - to - day operations between the groups will continue as planned			2
" everything will still happen the way it is supposed to happen , " said one @entity6 source with knowledge of the situation			0
" on a day - to - day level , those two groups work well together			2
" " people are n't going to let a working relationship not be good , " the source added hopefully , " when the stakes are so high			0
" despite public makeup , pro-clinton groups are very much at odds @entity1 's @entity256 contributed to this report .			2

the public rift in @entity28 land has led some to question whether @entity60 super pacs can continue to work together
the groups were founded to work in concert with one another with tacit support from the @entity266
tensions were still simmering after two days of *negative* headlines for the collective groups
