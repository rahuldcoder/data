few @entity1 politicians will have raised a @entity4 glass in expectation of a brighter future			2
many fear that 2015 could be the year in which both the euro and the @entity1 itself begin to unravel			1
once again the troubles will begin early in @entity12 , a country carelessly admitted to the euro before its finances were properly in shape , and which has twice had to be bailed out and bullied into efforts to get its economy onto a sound footing			2
once again the @entity12 economy is at the heart of a euro crisis			2
the failure of the @entity12 government led by @entity24 to win a majority vote for its favored presidential candidate means that @entity12 faces a snap general election on january 25 , news that saw the @entity12 stock market fall 5 % in one day			1
polls suggest that the likely winner in the @entity12 general election will be @entity33 and his left - wing populist party , @entity35			1
the problem with that for the @entity1 is that with more than a quarter of the @entity12 population unemployed , despite some signs of recovery in the economy , @entity35 is winning wide support for its pledge to dump most of the pledges attached to its bailouts by the rest of @entity48			1
@entity33 wants to end the austerity program imposed largely at @entity51 's insistence , reverse cuts in the minimum wage and repudiate much of @entity12 's debts			2
although @entity33 has toned down his previous rhetoric and says he wants @entity12 to remain in the euro , it is hard to see how it could if he wins and holds to his election promises			1
@entity12 's departure would be the first major blow for the euro , and the wider @entity1			1
but @entity12 is not alone in having euroskeptic parties riding high in the opinion polls			1
both @entity64 and @entity65 have elections scheduled in 2015			1
in @entity64 , @entity67 , a party strongly opposed to austerity programs designed to keep the country within euro rules is currently heading the polls			1
@entity65 , facing the consequences of a 78 billion euro bailout ( $ 97 billion ) is racked by uncertainty following the arrest of government officials and leading politicians in both major parties over financial scandals			1
while " eurocrats " in @entity86 hope that the likely turmoil in @entity12 will lead voters in @entity64 and @entity65 to play for safety , it could have the opposite effect , emboldening voters to swing behind populist parties without coherent financial programs			1
in @entity92 too , three of the four biggest parties -- @entity93 , the @entity94 and comedian @entity96 's @entity95 -- are making increasingly euroskeptic noises			0
the biggest threat to @entity48 's future , though , comes from the general election in the @entity101 , a country which has stayed outside the euro			0
political scientists acknowledge that the @entity101 election , due in may , is the hardest to call in living memory			0
the euroskeptic @entity106 ( @entity106 ) has proven both by victory in the 2014 @entity109 elections and by success in recent by - elections for the @entity112 , that it can take votes from both major parties , the conservatives and the @entity116			2
participation in the coalition government has badly damaged the @entity119 , the @entity115 ' partners , and in the aftermath of the referendum on independence for @entity124 , the @entity125 is polling at a level that suggests it could wrest at least 20 @entity112 seats from @entity116 , which has always depended on a hefty contingent of mps in @entity124 seats to win national elections			0
neither major party looks capable of winning a @entity101 election in its own right , but who the partners would be in any coalition formed to govern after may is totally uncertain			0
already the administration likely to be formed then is being dubbed " @entity139			0
" should the conservatives led by @entity142 again emerge as the largest single party and form part of another coalition government , he would have to implement his pledge to stage an " @entity149 " referendum on continued @entity101 membership of the @entity1 , after he has sought to renegotiate the terms of that membership with other leaders in @entity86			0
the danger for the @entity1 is that in countering the appeal of @entity106 , @entity142 has been led into ever more vigorous vows to curb the numbers coming in , or to deny them welfare benefits if they do			0
if @entity48 fails to agree a compromise on the principle of free movement across borders within the @entity1 then the expectations @entity142 has aroused will be disappointed and many conservatives will be likely to join @entity106 supporters in voting against @entity101 's continued membership of the @entity1 if the referendum is staged in 2017			0
that possibility poses a dilemma for other @entity48 leaders like @entity171 , who has long insisted that the principle of free movement is sacrosanct			0
on january 1 , 2015 , @entity1 leaders were able to celebrate one measure of progress : @entity176 became the last of the three @entity179 states which entered the @entity1 in 2004 to ditch its old currency , the litas , and to become a fully - fledged member of the euro club			2
it may be the last thing those @entity1 leaders have to celebrate for quite some while			0
opinion : @entity106 's victory throws @entity101 into political @entity189 : will @entity142 's gamble take @entity101 out of @entity48 ?			0

2015 looks like being a very difficult year for the euro and the @entity1 , @entity192 says
*anti-austerity* party @entity35 could win snap election in @entity12 , *threatening* to reverse *reforms*
@entity64 and @entity65 have euroskeptic parties riding high in polls , and elections due soon
