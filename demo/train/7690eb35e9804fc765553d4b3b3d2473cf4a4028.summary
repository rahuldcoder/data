-- @entity1 took a giant step towards the quarterfinals of the @entity4 following a crushing 3 - 0 win over @entity6			1
@entity8 's early strike and further goals from @entity10 and @entity11 completed a perfect night 's work for the @entity14 champions			1
there was also success for @entity17 , which claimed a 2 - 1 away win at @entity18 , although it must do without star striker @entity19 in the second leg after he was shown a straight red card			1
@entity22 and @entity23 had given the @entity25 club a two goal lead at the break , but @entity29 's late strike and @entity19 's dismissal means its all to play for in the @entity25 capital in three weeks time			1
@entity32 while @entity17 might still have to sweat , no such problems are expected for @entity35 leaders and two - time @entity4 winners @entity1			1
dressed in all black and surrounded by the cauldron of @entity38 , @entity1 headed out to face one of the most intimidating atmospheres in @entity42 football			1
with the majority of the 57,917 crowd clad in green and white bellowing out their support for the @entity47 champion , it was clear that this night was something special			2
back in the knockout phase for the first time in five years , @entity6 was dreaming of the glory days when it ruled the continent following its legendary cup final win of 1967			1
the victory over the might of @entity58 in @entity59 , led to the team , which was to become known as the ' @entity32 ' , becoming the first @entity62 side to win the trophy			0
managed by the legendary @entity66 , all of the players were born within a 30 mile radius of @entity68			0
on may 24 1967 , @entity59 was overrun with the green and white of @entity6 and not that of local club @entity69			2
goals from @entity71 and @entity72 secured victory over an @entity58 side which had won three of the four past editions of the competition			0
" there is not a prouder man on @entity82 's @entity81 than me at this moment , " said @entity66 following the triumph			0
" @entity84 was important , but it was the way that we won that has filled me with satisfaction			0
" we did it by playing football ; pure , beautiful , inventive football			0
there was not a negative thought in our heads			0
" that night in @entity59 is never far from memory whenever the words ' @entity42 ' and ' @entity6 ' are mentioned in the same breath			2
the success of the past generation is a reminder of how @entity6 became the first @entity104 club to win the competition , a fact which supporters are quick to point out at every opportunity			1
but while it has dominated domestically in recent years , helped by the downfall of fierce rival @entity110 , success in @entity42 has been more difficult to achieve			0
@entity113 , @entity114 or @entity115 : which is the biggest club ? not since it lost to @entity118 in the 2003 @entity120 final had @entity6 hit the @entity42 headlines , that was until this year and its shock victory over @entity114			2
a 2 - 1 home win against the @entity126 champions helped @entity128 's side qualify for the last - 16 and a meeting with @entity1			1
while the visitor appeared favorite on paper , @entity6 's home form in the @entity4 has been nothing short of remarkable			1
in its 23 matches before welcoming @entity1 , @entity6 had suffered just two defeats , while winning 15 and drawing six			1
with the second leg in @entity138 on march 6 to come , the home side would have hoped to secure a result in a bid to keep the tie alive			1
the atmosphere suggested a gladiatorial arena , the bloodcurdling noise of @entity38 rose as the players emerged			0
this was @entity6 's time			1
foreign owners in @entity104 football : the good the bad and the ugly or perhaps not			0
instead , it took @entity1 just three minutes to silence one of @entity42 football 's most intimidating arenas			1
on sunday , @entity154 was celebrating @entity156 's victory in the final of the @entity158 -- but on a freezing february night in @entity68 he was left to rue a horrendous defensive error			0
it was his mistake which allowed @entity163 's long ball to release @entity164 and the striker fired home , despite @entity167 trying to clear off the line			0
the shock and horror was etched across the faces of the @entity6 players , but slowly and surely , those emblazoned with the green and white began to show its famous spirit			2
@entity176 came agonizingly close to an equalizer when his overhead kick sailed just inches wide of the far post , while @entity154 should have netted with a free header just after the hour mark			0
that miss was to be severely punished as @entity1 wrapped the game up with 13 minutes remaining when @entity8 released @entity10 , who turned @entity184 and slotted the ball home			1
worse was to come for @entity6 with 83 minutes on the clock when @entity154 , who only returned from @entity188 on tuesday morning , gave away possession and @entity11 raced in to score			2
" we need a miracle , " @entity6 manager @entity128 told @entity190			2
" but it 's the harsh reality of @entity4 football and some of my young players will learn a huge lesson tonight			0
" i thought for 70 - odd minutes , until the second goal , we were by far the better side -- but you ca n't give away goals like we gave away , sloppy			0
" how @entity115 tried to drown the stars of @entity113 in 1957 on a day when wrestling was dropped from the @entity204 , @entity128 was frustrated with the way @entity1 ' defenders manhandled his players at set - pieces			1
time and time again , defender @entity209 was grappling with @entity211 and @entity184 inside the penalty area , but nothing was forthcoming from referee @entity214			0
" i 'd like to ask the referee , is the game different in @entity216 or @entity14 ? " @entity128 said			2
" every time one of my players tried to move he was held			0
he should have given a penalty on at least two occasions			0
" big spending masks age of austerity for top soccer clubs while that win all but secures @entity1 ' place in the last eight , @entity17 faces a more difficult proposition following an infuriatingly frustrating second half performance			1
in front of a watching @entity231 , who is hoping to make his debut within the next few weeks , @entity17 showed why they should be feared in this year 's competition			1
leading 2 - 0 thanks to goals from @entity22 and @entity23 , @entity237 's men missed several golden opportunities and could have easily scored four or five at the @entity239			1
@entity22 , who has now scored in each of his past three @entity4 games , should have had a hat - trick only to miss two simple chances			2
@entity231 to donate @entity17 wages to children 's charity that wastefulness was punished in the final minute when @entity29 bundled home from close range to give the home side hope			1
the tie then took another twist when @entity19 was shown a straight red card for a controversial studs up challenge on @entity255			1
" @entity19 did not deserve the red card			2
i do n't understand the decision , " @entity237 told @entity258 television at full time			0
" we played well and had chances to score more goals			0
it was a good team performance , but this was just the first leg			0
there is still the return to come			0

@entity1 claims 3 - 0 win at @entity6 in first leg of last - 16 tie
@entity14 champion now in pole position to qualify for quarterfinal
@entity19 sent off in @entity17 's 2 - 1 win at @entity18
@entity19 will miss the second leg on march 6
