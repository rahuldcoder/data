a salmonella outbreak has sickened almost 500 people and killed at least six			1
@entity14 officials said saturday that peanut butter and peanut paste made from ground roasted peanuts , manufactured in @entity8 's @entity18 , @entity19 , plant were found to contain the bacteria , although a direct link to the strain that has now sickened 474 people in 43 states has not been found			1
six deaths may have been connected to this salmonella outbreak			1
@entity8 announced an expanded recall of peanut butter and peanut paste produced from its @entity19 plant friday night			2
@entity8 does n't directly supply to supermarkets , so brand - name peanut butters are not expected to be affected , according to the @entity32			1
instead , @entity8 sells produce in bulk			0
the peanut butter is sold in containers from 5 to 1,700 pounds			0
peanut paste is sold in sizes from 35 - pound containers to tankers			0
the peanut paste is used in the manufacturing of cakes , candies , crackers , cookies and ice cream , @entity14 officials say			2
@entity49 and @entity50 health officials have confirmed salmonella typhimurium linked to this outbreak in bulk containers found in institutions such as prisons , schools and nursing homes			0
the @entity14 is urging companies that make these foods to check whether they use peanut butter or paste produced by the company			0
the recalled peanut butter was manufactured on or after august 8 , 2008 ; the peanut paste was produced on or after september 26 , 2008			0
the administration is urging companies to notify consumers if the products they manufacture may contain peanut products from @entity8 it is also urging companies whose products do not contain @entity8 peanut butter or paste to make that information available to the public			2
the @entity75 announced a voluntary recall of 16 products , including @entity78 and @entity80 peanut butter cookies , because they contain peanut butter that could be connected to @entity8 the @entity14 does not have the authority to order a recall of products			1
it has to rely on companies doing so voluntarily			0
@entity86 would have to pass a law to give the @entity14 such power @entity8 products are also distributed by @entity90 , which voluntarily recalled its products a week ago			1
" the majority of products [ like cookies , crackers , ice cream ] are manufactured with products that do n't come from @entity8 , " said dr. @entity92 , the @entity14 's director of the @entity93			1
however , until people can be sure that the peanut cookies or crackers they have do not contain product from @entity8 , the @entity14 is asking consumers to hold off on eating them			1

" it took temperatures up to 250 degrees [ @entity111 ] to kill salmonella , " @entity92 said			0
even if a cookie is cooked at 350 degrees , it does n't guarantee that the center of the food gets that hot , making it possible for some some salmonella bacteria to survive			0
