-- once more , as i often do , i find myself wishing for the late , great dr. @entity2			1
it was he who said , " when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro. " but it was @entity10 gov. @entity9 who brought @entity2 's maxim to life wednesday			1
in fact , gov. @entity9 brought it to the stage of a televised debate			1
to begin with , @entity9 has all the telegenic appeal of a garden slug : lean and hairless and slick and creepy			2
but then again , i 've been a friend and business partner of @entity21 for 30 years , so who am i to judge ? what gov. @entity9 demonstrated to the world is that , beneath that creepy exterior is an even more creepy psyche			2
a guy who is so deeply weird , so twisted and nutty that he would boycott a debate at the last second because his opponent had a small electric fan beneath his podium to keep him cool			1
granted , the fan was a violation of the rules , but who cares ? a human being would have sent minions out after the debate to note that his opponent , former gov. @entity40 , broke the rules			1
a politician with even a dash of personality might even have used it to mock @entity40 : " i suspect @entity40 was worried his face would melt " -- a sly shot at @entity40 's perma - tan			1
i have seen and done a lot of crazy stuff in political debates			0
in 1992 , my compadres and i stole the stools @entity54 rehearsed on from a @entity56 , @entity57 , hotel and put them on the stage of the @entity61 - @entity60 - @entity54 town hall debate in @entity62 , so gov. @entity54 would have the home - butt advantage			2
i made one client so angry before a debate that he rhetorically bludgeoned his opponent until the poor man wept onstage			0
i know a politician who whispered the name of his opponent 's mistress to him in the opening handshake of a debate			0
i even saw the governor of @entity74 forget how to count to three in a nationally televised debate			0
but i ai n't never seen nothin ' like @entity9 's fan dance			1
@entity9 refused to come on the stage for seven excruciating minutes			1
@entity40 could not conceal his glee			0
he had the same expression on his face that i had when i was an 18 - year old pizza delivery boy called to bring lunch to the lovely dancers at @entity85 in @entity86			0
" i can not believe my luck			0
this is not really happening			0
" everything since that magical moment for me has been anticlimactic , and i 'm sure everything from now on will be for @entity40			0
@entity40 will become governor again , and @entity9 will slink back under the rock from whence he emerged			1
but even there , in the gritty grime of the fetid @entity10 sand , he will be recognized and remembered as the guy who blew it because of a fan			2
when dr. @entity2 removed himself from this @entity102 he had his ashes shot out of a cannon			0
a spectacular explosion of fireworks scattered @entity2 's earthly remains over @entity107			2
@entity9 's political demise was considerably less spectacular ; the remains of his career as a politician were blown all across @entity10 by a one - foot - wide electric fan .			1

@entity115 : @entity2 said : when going gets weird , the weird turn pro. enter @entity9
@entity9 held up debate seven minutes when rival for governor , @entity40 , had fan in his podium
@entity124 : @entity9 's political career blown across @entity10 by a one - foot - wide electric fan .
