@entity0 -- an estimated 1 million people marked the passing of one year and the beginning of another in @entity0 's @entity6 with the descent of an iconic ball			1
with the help of mayor @entity11 and @entity13 recipient staff sgt. @entity12 , the dazzling crystal ball began its 70 - foot drop at 11:59 p.m. friday to the harmonious chants of @entity17 revelers counting down the final seconds of 2010			1
more than one ton of confetti was released at midnight , with personal individual wishes written in more than 25 languages , a tradition from the past three years			0
weighing in at 11,875 pounds with a diameter of 12 feet , the sparkling sphere is covered with 2,668 triangular crystals and is powered by 32,256 led lights			2
by mixing red , blue , green and white light elements , the ball 's lighting system is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million hues and colors , and billions of patterns , the event 's website says			1
each giant @entity37 's numeral making up " 2 - 0 - 1 - 1 " will stand seven feet high and the numerals will use a total 453 9 - watt led bulbs			2
as in the past three years , the numerals were designed to be more energy efficient , as @entity42 set up a lab in which visitors rode stationary bikes to provide the stored battery power that will light the numbers on the ball friday night			2
@entity6 has served as one of the most popular sites of @entity37 's festivities since 1904 , though the @entity17 ball made its inaugural drop down the flagpole at @entity55 in 1907			1
that first ball , built with iron and wood , featured one hundred light bulbs and was designed by @entity60 , a young immigrant metalworker			2
@entity62 ball has beamed and dropped every year since with the exceptions of 1942 and 1943 , when the @entity64 was embroiled in @entity65 and @entity0 observed a city - wide " dim - out " to cut energy costs			1
according to @entity0 police commissioner @entity69 , this @entity17 celebration , like years in the past , is a product of a lot of hard work and planning by many people			0
" we do n't ever take it for granted , " @entity69 said			0
" the situation changes somewhat , we have sort of a core plan but we always add to it or change it -- we do n't want to get stuck in a rut where we simply take a plan off the shelf			0
" as in previous years , security will be tight			0
@entity6 will be closed to traffic at approximately 3 p.m. on friday			1
backpacks and alcohol are prohibited at the event and party - goers can expect a beefed - up police presence , according to the statement from the @entity93			0
" it is a big complex operation and you know you always breathe a sigh of relief when it 's over , " @entity69 said .			0
