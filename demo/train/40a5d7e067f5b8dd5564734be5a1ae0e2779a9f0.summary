@entity0 , who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat , is the 2014 @entity8			1
" there is no stronger bond between man and dog than that formed during war , " @entity9 said at the annual tribute show , which aired sunday night on @entity1 's global networks			1
the star - studded event , held in @entity19 at the @entity20 , honored the @entity21 @entity8 of 2014 -- everyday people making extraordinary efforts to change the world			1
of those 10 , @entity1 's audience voted @entity0 as the @entity8			1
" wow , i am absolutely at a loss for words , " @entity9 said as he accepted the award			1
" this is absolutely amazing			1
i would really like to thank everybody who voted for the @entity32 charity and what we do in @entity35 and believing in us			1
and i would also like to thank all the other heroes in this room for doing what they do to make this world an absolute better place			1
thank you guys for doing what you do			1
" in addition to the $ 25,000 that each person receives for making the @entity21 , @entity0 will be awarded $ 100,000 for his cause			1
the inspiration for @entity48 came in 2006			1
when @entity9 helped break up a dogfight in the town of @entity32 , @entity35 , the @entity50 sergeant did n't think much of it			1
the war - torn town was overrun with dogs			1
but when one of those dogs followed him back to base , it was hard to tell who rescued whom			1
" as the troop sergeant , i was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job			1
... but no one was doing that for me , " @entity9 said earlier this year			1
" my time with this dog was a way of de-stressing , collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game			1
" after his tour ended , @entity9 went through a difficult process to get @entity32 home to @entity80			1
realizing he was n't the only one , he soon founded @entity48 to help other soldiers whose lives were turned around by the animals they befriended			1
@entity48 also works to promote animal welfare in @entity35			1
the group 's shelter and clinic in @entity89 are staffed by 14 @entity35 nationals , four of whom are trained veterinarians			1
the group spays and neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population			1
in turn , those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets			1
to date , @entity48 has reunited nearly 700 soldiers with the animals they adopted in @entity35			1
" i know that the dog i looked after was my saving grace from the stress of conflict , " @entity9 said			1
" and because of that initial bond , the work goes on : reuniting soldiers with their companions , tackling rabies and training veterinarians in @entity89			1
i would like to thank everybody for their support			1
we 're making a difference for the @entity35 people , the soldiers and one dog and cat at a time			1
