-- this summer , a group of @entity3 students and staff has been patrolling campus grounds -- scouting out any student , employee or visitor lighting a cigarette			1
unlike hall monitors who cite students for bad behavior , the @entity12 - free take action ! volunteers approach smokers , respectfully ask them to dispose of the cigarette and provide information about quit - smoking resources available on campus			1
the @entity3 is one of more than 500 college campuses across the country that have enacted 100 % smoke - free or tobacco - free policies as of july 1			1
although policy enforcement varies from school to school , most prohibit smoking on all campus grounds , including athletic stadiums , restaurants and parking lots			2
an increasing number of colleges adopted smoke - free or tobacco - free policies in the past few years , according to @entity38 @entity37 project manager @entity36			1
in the past year alone , 120 campuses were added to the smoke - free list			1
the most successful policies have been grass - roots efforts driven by students and campus employees			1
" they typically come about because students and faculty are questioning the role of tobacco in an educational setting and deciding to discourage its use and exposure , " @entity36 said			2
about 46 million @entity38 age 18 and older smoke cigarettes , according to the @entity55			2
a 2010 @entity57 report found that out of 30,093 students surveyed at 39 colleges , 4.4 % had smoked every day in the past 30 days			1
since the first surgeon general report declaring the negative effects of smoking in 1964 , smoking has become " socially less acceptable " among people of all ages , especially college students , says @entity67 , chairwoman of the health association 's @entity68			1
" there 's a very health - conscious , socially aware student that we have on campus these days , " she said			2
should smoking be banned in public ? the smoke - free spree it was n't until the early 2000s that 100 % smoke - free campuses began popping up across the @entity38			1
@entity80 , the former vice president of student affairs at @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , says he started the first smoke - free campus in 2003 , but the idea was planted in 1999			1
" the president came to me and said , ' @entity80 , we 've got problems			0
you ca n't get in and out of doorways without going through a corridor of smoke , ' " @entity80 recalled			2
@entity80 , who had quit smoking two years prior , set out to find a higher education institution that had managed to eliminate tobacco on campus			2
to @entity80 's dismay , there were n't any			0
" when i explained to ( schools ) what we were thinking about doing , they said ... ' we 'd love to be able to do that , but we do n't know how , ' " he said			0
over the next four years , @entity80 developed a policy in which trained staff members held polite conversations with students and faculty who violated the smoking rules			2
the first violation is a warning			0
the second and third result in $ 15 fines or two hours spent picking up tobacco litter			2
for any further violations , the offender is placed on probation or asked to leave the school			0
although some employees vehemently opposed the policy , @entity80 says , no staff member ever reached the third violation , and only two students were placed on probation from the time the school enforced the policy in october 2004			0
@entity81 spent more than 3Â½ years developing the initiative and educating students and staff about the forthcoming policy			2
however , @entity80 -- who has now helped more than 500 schools , hospitals and businesses implement smoking bans as the director of the @entity136 -- says most campuses today can effectively institute a policy in one year since there 's less resistance to the concept than in 2003			1
early morning smokers have higher cancer risk it really works the @entity145 enacted a smoke - free policy on july 1			1
campus officials spent three years researching policies and forming focus groups , committees and surveys to seek student and faculty input			0
since the ban was implemented , school chief health officer dr. @entity155 says , it 's uncommon to see smokers anywhere but along city of @entity160 sidewalks -- where smoking is permitted			1
he cited one entrance to the @entity163 known as a smoker hot spot			0
when he visited the area recently , he noted , " there was n't a smoker in sight			0
" in 2009 , the state of @entity170 had one of the highest smoking rates at 25.6 % , according to the @entity55			1
since the @entity3 turned smoke - free in november that year , an increasing number of people have sought tobacco treatment services			1
in 2008 , 33 people enrolled in a tobacco cessation program			0
after the policy 's first year , enrollment rose to 146 people , according to @entity181 , director of @entity3 's @entity182			2
the number of nicotine replacement coupons redeemed by students and faculty also increased from 124 to 470 in the same period			0
for smokers visiting the campus , @entity3 offers nicotine cessation products , such as gum or patches , for $ 5 at several locations			1
" we 're trying to make it comfortable for people so they do n't feel like they have to light up and violate the policy , " @entity193 said			0
secondhand smoke boosts kids ' adhd , learning disability risks policy patrol during the first semester of a smoking ban , @entity80 recommends that universities not come down with a heavy fist and instead educate the community about the policy and the negative effects of tobacco			1
nearly two years later , the @entity3 still does n't exercise strict enforcement			2
" we certainly do n't have smoking police , " @entity193 said			0
instead , smoke - free supporters like senior @entity214 , a @entity12 - free take action ! volunteer , remind smokers of the ban			1
@entity214 said the 10 smokers she asked to extinguish their cigarettes this summer all complied			0
" in a tobacco state , you might think we 'd have more backlash and opposition than we did , " said @entity193 , explaining that only a few students held a protest the day the policy launched			0
regardless of the health benefits , opponents argue that smoke - free policies infringe on people 's rights			1
@entity145 senior @entity232 , president of the @entity233 , says smoking is a " personal choice			0
" " it 's not within the scope of the university 's responsibilities to decide that smoking is an activity that we as adults should n't engage in , " he said			0
@entity244 , an attorney currently fighting a citywide smoking ban in @entity82 , @entity83 , says smoking bans " just do n't really make sense			1
" " any time you tell ( people ) that they ca n't do something they want to do , really they 're just going to do it anyway			0
... all you 're doing is encouraging disrespect for authority , " @entity244 said			0
smoking in pregnancy linked to serious birth defects a smoke - free future the @entity258 went tobacco - free in july 2010 , and @entity259 in @entity260 plans to adopt the policy in 2012			1
this spurred students at @entity264 to talk with administrators about following their lead , says @entity268 president @entity267			0
in response , the association plans to distribute a ballot this fall , in which students will vote for or against a smoking ban			1
@entity80 predicts that nearly all college campuses in the @entity38 will be 100 % smoke - free in 10 years			1
@entity67 , too , says it 's a possibility -- mentioning how professors once smoked in their offices but ca n't today			0
" we 've gone from pushing smoking out of the building ... to now trying to push smoking totally off campus , " she said			0
although it may take time to sink in , @entity193 said , people eventually " get it			0
" " they get the idea that tobacco use just is n't accepted here			0

about *530* colleges across the country that have enacted 100 % smoke - free policies
@entity81 in @entity83 started the first smoking ban in 2003
more smokers have sought treatment at @entity3 since it banned tobacco in 2009
