-- this week marks the @entity2 holiday of @entity3			1
across @entity5 , families build primitive structures with branches or palm fronds as roofs			2
they do so to remember the biblical exodus from @entity11 and 40 years of exile in the @entity13			0
it is a celebration of survival			0
despite a raging war in neighboring @entity17 and a confrontation between the military and @entity20 in @entity11 , @entity3 finds @entity5 in an upbeat mood			1
@entity22 is packed with vacationers , the shekel is strong , and economic growth this year is expected to be close to 4 %			2
as they recall their ancestors ' wandering in the desert , @entity5 @entity2 feel surprisingly secure			1
in a poll by the @entity30 this month , 74 % expected their security situation to remain the same or improve over the next year			0
@entity5 's leaders are less sanguine , but not because @entity34 president @entity33 might lash out against the jewish state			1
they are much more apprehensive about a new @entity37 president bearing gifts at the @entity39			1
@entity40 , elected in june to succeed @entity41 , has already extended an olive branch			0
he has released " prisoners of conscience " and told @entity43 that @entity37 would not " seek any weapons of mass destruction " under any circumstances			2
now , the diplomatic corridors are abuzz with speculation that @entity40 will make a dramatic announcement at the @entity39 , perhaps offering to close the @entity53 enrichment plant or allow inspectors into the @entity56 site for the first time			0
@entity40 is expected to meet ministers of most if not all the permanent members of the @entity60			0
@entity37 's @entity40 : diplomat 's touch , no pushover @entity64 , executive director of the @entity65 at @entity66 , said this week in an interview with the @entity68 that the @entity37 " are tough bargainers , they have real principles , and they 're going to insist on them , but they 're going to put those principles out in a much more attractive way than the previous administration did			1
" sick is among those arguing for a new dialogue between the @entity78 and @entity37 , as is the @entity79 , where @entity80 wrote that @entity37 was an indispensable partner in resolving @entity17 's crisis			1
and that 's what worries @entity5			1
it sees @entity40 , who once led @entity37 's nuclear negotiating team , as an able tactician			1
intelligence minister @entity88 put it most colorfully , saying @entity40 would " smile all the way to the bomb			0
" he is " a wolf in sheep 's clothing , " @entity88 says			0
prime minister @entity95 has very publicly reiterated that the @entity96 must stop enriching uranium , get rid of the enriched uranium it currently has , close the facility in @entity101 and stop its program to develop a plutonium " track			0
" " until all these measures are taken , the pressure on @entity37 should be increased and not relieved , certainly not eased , " @entity95 said			2
in short , the message to @entity108 should be : " if you want to save the @entity37 economy , give up your nuclear program			1
" there is no third way			0
president @entity40 says @entity37 wo n't develop nuclear weapons @entity5 officials are worried that the @entity78 and @entity118 , in an effort to encourage @entity37 moderation , will begin to relax the devastating financial , shipping and oil sanctions built up against @entity37 , and allow more time to coax the @entity37 toward agreement in the long - running " @entity122 " talks			1
that would be a fatal mistake , in the @entity5 ' view , allowing @entity37 to run the last lap toward building a bomb			1
the @entity5 media have seized on remarks by @entity37 's supreme leader , ayatollah @entity131 , who this week said cryptically : " heroic flexibility is very useful and necessary sometimes but with adherence to one main condition			1
... a wrestler sometimes shows flexibility for technical reasons			0
but he does not forget about his opponent nor about his main objective			0
" columnist @entity140 in @entity141 wrote that @entity131 's remarks could suggest a change in @entity37 policy but equally might also indicate " a trick in the spirit of the @entity148 bazaar			1
first you have to smile , calm the customer on the other side , and then produce the goods without revealing the final price			0
" while @entity78 officials and analysts are divided about @entity37 's ultimate intentions and debate when the capability to build a nuclear device might become a program to do so , @entity5 in and out of government have no doubt about @entity37 's objective : a " critical capability , " or the ability to produce sufficient weapon - grade uranium from its stocks of low - enriched uranium for a nuclear explosive without being detected			1
the term was used by the @entity170 in july when it estimated @entity37 could achieve this critical capability in mid- 2014 , given the rapid increase in the number of centrifuges at the @entity176 and @entity53 sites			2
it is an assessment the @entity5 endorse			2
in a @entity0 interview , intelligence minister @entity88 said that @entity37 's nuclear program was many times larger than @entity181 's and that only a credible threat of military force and serious deadlines would deter the @entity37			1
he drew a parallel with @entity17 : only when president @entity186 declared that the @entity33 regime had crossed a red line and that military action would follow did the @entity34 blink			1
@entity5 officials were disappointed -- to put it mildly -- when @entity186 decided to seek congressional authorization for military strikes			1
and they were horrified when it appeared that @entity198 , under the influence of overwhelming public opposition to another foreign engagement , seemed unlikely to grant that authorization			0
what a message to send to @entity37			2
@entity37 's president calls for ' constructive ' dialogue , end to ' unhealthy ' rivalries the immediate response among officials and commentators in @entity5 was to invoke the @entity2 sage @entity207 : " if i am not for myself , who will be for me ? " so the @entity212 - @entity78 deal to strip @entity17 of its chemical weapons came as a relief in @entity215			1
as one @entity5 analyst put it , " it 's a win - win - win - win			2
" the @entity212 re-established themselves as diplomatic heavyweights , @entity186 was spared humiliation , @entity33 avoided a shower of cruise missiles			0
and @entity5 could at least hope that the @entity34 chemical arsenal would be incinerated rather than be used in desperation by a sinking regime or fall into the hands of @entity226			2
that is " hope " rather than " expect			0
" most @entity5 analysts are deeply skeptical that @entity33 will give up all his chemical weapons			2
@entity17 developed the weapons in response to @entity5 's growing military superiority and its nuclear deterrent			1
@entity235 of the @entity236 at @entity237 in @entity238 says chemical weapons are also @entity33 's insurance policy , his ultimate deterrent in protecting the @entity243 minority			0
in common with many @entity5 analysts , @entity235 believes the timetable for the removal and destruction of @entity17 's chemical weapons is unrealistic			1
he told @entity0 that the process would take three to four years and would require a cease - fire to be effective , and there would be ample opportunity for obstruction and evasion			0
the @entity5 government wants the threat of military action against @entity17 to be simmering on the front burner			1
it 's the only language that @entity33 understands , they say , just as it 's the only language @entity131 and @entity40 understand			0
in many ways , the winds of change across the @entity266 world are blowing favorably for @entity5 , even if they could change direction without warning			2
the @entity11 military is hurting @entity271 in the @entity272 by closing many of the tunnels that it relies on for trade and weapons			0
and the @entity278 have submitted to yet another attempt to reach a two - state solution ( one that 's going nowhere , @entity278 sources say )			0
two once - mighty @entity266 armies , the @entity34 and @entity283 , are debilitated			0
the @entity5 intelligence community is confident that it will detect any @entity34 effort to transfer chemical weapons to @entity226 , and @entity226 risks losing one of its main patrons in @entity33 ( though its fighters are gaining valuable experience helping him )			0
the @entity5 appear confident of being able to contain @entity293 extremists should they emerge as a force in a @entity17			1
until now , @entity5 policy has been to say little and hope @entity33 's forces and the rebels cancel each other out			2
but @entity299 , @entity5 ambassador to the @entity78 , suggested this week that @entity33 is the worse of two evils			1
" we always preferred the bad guys who were n't backed by @entity37 to the bad guys who were backed by @entity37 , " he told the @entity301			0
" the greatest danger to @entity5 is the strategic arc that extends from @entity108 , to @entity307 to @entity308 , " he added			0
in @entity5 , so much of the regional picture is seen through the prism of @entity37			1
so it 's not the @entity266 that most worry @entity5 at the moment			1
it 's the @entity148 bazaar , described a long time ago by an @entity78 diplomat as a " mindset that often ignores longer - term interests in favor of immediately obtainable advantages , and countenances practices that are regarded as unethical by other norms			2
" @entity5 worries that its allies will be overly enthusiastic buyers .			0

in @entity5 , the shekel 's strong , the economy 's growing , and @entity5 @entity2 feel surprisingly secure
but @entity5 's leaders are apprehensive about diplomatic efforts from @entity37 's new president
they also worry that the @entity78 and @entity118 will relax sanctions that have devastated @entity37
@entity5 's government wants the threat of military action against @entity17 to stay on the front burner
