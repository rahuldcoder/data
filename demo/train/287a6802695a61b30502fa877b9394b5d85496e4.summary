the departure of such big names as defending champion @entity12 , @entity13 and world no. 1 @entity9 seems to have paved the way for the sport 's biggest star , @entity15			1
woods had another solid day friday , moving to a tie for the lead with @entity20 and @entity21			2
they all ended 1 - under through two rounds			1

" @entity4 leaderboard others struggled on the tree - lined @entity31 golf course despite the near - perfect weather			1
the 23 - year - old @entity34 may have sealed his fate on the last hole friday			0
@entity12 seemed to have a birdie putt set up nicely to get him to eight over			1
instead , he three - putted for a bogey in a shaky performance that had the crowd groaning and @entity12 looking to the sky in frustration			1
" you really have to be so precise out there , and if you 're not , you 're going to get punished , " @entity12 told reporters			2
" it 's just something that you have to adjust to in this tournament			0
i was n't able to do that very well this week			0
" @entity13 finished at 9 over as he continued to struggle hitting fairways			2
the grouping of @entity15 , @entity52 and @entity13 was billed as the marquee pairing of popular champions , but @entity15 was the only one who lived up to the billing			1
