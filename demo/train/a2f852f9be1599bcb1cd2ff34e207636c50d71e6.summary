@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration thursday evening asked a federal appeals court in @entity5 to reconsider its order last week temporarily blocking the @entity8 military from enforcing its " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on gays and lesbians serving in the military			1
@entity8 officials have been moving ahead with dismantling the policy but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it at this time			1
at issue in the complex legal fight is whether " do n't ask , do n't tell " can remain in effect -- even in name only -- while the legal fight over its constitutionality is being carried out in the federal courts			1
judges have been at odds over the enforcement issue for months			0
the case has put the @entity3 administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal , but at the same time filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned			1
military officials suggest the policy compliance changes eliminating " do n't ask , do n't tell " could be finished in a few weeks			1
federal courts -- including the @entity33 -- have bounced back and forth over the temporary enforcement question , ignoring for now the larger question 's of the federal law 's constitutionality			1
in its second appeal thursday , the @entity38 in an emergency motion said the federal courts are overstepping their authority			2
" the @entity43 are moving forward expeditiously to prepare for the repeal of ( " @entity45 ) in a fashion that @entity47 and the president consider the most effective way possible , and consistent with the nation 's military needs , " said the appeal			2
" the ( judicial ) panel 's order cuts that process short and overrides the judgments of @entity47 and the president on a complex and important question of military policy			0
" in a brief order a week ago , the 9th @entity8 circuit @entity57 said " the process of repealing ( the policy ) is well underway , and the preponderance of the armed forces are expected to have been trained by mid-summer " on abiding by the new guidelines			2
however , said the three - judge panel , " the circumstances and balance of hardships have changed , " concluding that as a result , " do n't ask , do n't tell " can not remain in place			1
the @entity72 - based appeals court 's order is temporary , until it can fully hear the issue with oral arguments in late august			1
a gay rights group -- the @entity75 -- had sued over the 18 - year - old ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the @entity8 armed forces			0
in september , @entity8 district judge @entity79 declared the military 's ban to be unconstitutional , and demanded the government immediately stop enforcing it			0
@entity47 has since passed legislation signed by president @entity3 to gradually eliminate " do n't ask , do n't tell , " but @entity86 officials had refused to issue a timeline on when that policy change would be completed			1
it is an issue defense secretary @entity90 , who took over the post this month , will now have to confront			0
if " do n't ask , do n't tell " is fully dismantled , and any current investigations of gay and lesbian service members are suspended , the legal appeals might quickly become moot			1
but the @entity75 have vowed to continue the legal fight until then			0
the @entity33 last fall upheld an earlier order keeping the policy in place			2
@entity75 slammed the administration 's newest court action			1
" this latest maneuver by the president continues a pattern of doublespeak that all @entity8 should find troubling			0
all this does is further confuse the situation for our men and women in uniform , " said @entity108 , the group 's executive director , who is also a captain in the @entity110			0
" ' @entity117 ' is an offense to @entity8 values that should have been gone long ago			0
it is shameful that a president who has taken credit for opposing the policy is taking extreme measures to keep it on life support			0
" @entity3 had said he long wanted to repeal " do n't ask , do n't tell , " and had reached an agreement with then - defense secretary @entity128 and adm. @entity129 , the chairman of the @entity131 , on a process that included a military review of how to make a successful transition to openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving			1
the three men would then have to certify the repeal			2
gay rights groups say the policy -- even as it is being discarded -- violates the due process and first amendment rights of military members			0
in their appeals , the @entity75 said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal would be unacceptable and would cause " irreparable harm			1
" the government presented " no evidence to support a finding that open service by gay and lesbian individuals harmed the military 's interests , and ... both civilian and military leaders admitted that @entity45 actually impairs military interests , " the appeal claimed			0
" deference to military judgment here tips the scales against a stay , rather than in favor of one , " it said			0
but the @entity3 administration , supported by @entity86 officials , argued that suspending the policy and forcing the military to immediately change course while the case is being appealed would cause problems during a time of war			1
" the military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years , particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas , " said the government in an earlier legal brief			2
after the court 's order last week , @entity86 spokesman col. @entity180 said the military " will of course comply with orders of the court , and are taking immediately steps to inform the field of this order			1
" he added , " in the meantime , implementation of the @entity45 repeal voted by the @entity47 and signed in to law by the president last december is proceeding smoothly , is well underway , and certification is just weeks away			2
" @entity195 last fall raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under " do n't ask , do n't tell " by ordering that it only be done by the secretaries of the @entity110 , @entity201 and @entity202			0
in a memo written to the heads of all the military services , @entity128 said his action was taken in direct response to the legal uncertainty surrounding " do n't ask , do n't tell " law			0
the case is @entity75 v. @entity8 ( 10 - 56634 ) .			0

an appeals court ruled last week that " do n't ask , do n't tell " can not remain in place
the @entity3 administration is asking the court to reconsider that ruling
the administration supports the repeal but objects to having courts set the timing
