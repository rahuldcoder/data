@entity0 , @entity1 -- when i 'm not on the road working , i want to feel as if i 'm on vacation			1
that 's why i live in @entity0			1
i travel a lot for work and for pleasure , but every time i walk through my door , i say to my husband , " i love our home			2
" @entity0 , just north of @entity15 , is a beautiful oceanfront town known for seven miles of sandy beach			1
when i 'm in town , i take advantage of a path that gives bicyclists an ocean view while they exercise			2
this inviting stretch of sand became popular when it was shown on the big screen in the 1960 film " where the boys are , " starring @entity27 and @entity28			2
things have changed a lot in @entity0 since that movie			1
the strip , the section along the beach where most of the shops , hotels and restaurants are congregated , is still there , and the businesses have gone upscale over the past few years			2
but you still do n't have to dress fancy even for the finest restaurants			1
@entity0 has embraced the laid - back beach culture where a nice pair of jeans with a presentable shirt is fine in almost any establishment			1
an everyman 's guide to @entity48 where can you get the best view of the city ? no one cares about the city views when you can look at the beach and the blue @entity56			1
so , i 'll tell you the best place to sit , have a drink and look at the beach			2
the recently opened deck at @entity64 's @entity63 has a great unobstructed view of the ocean and is walking distance from the strip			1
on a night when the moon is not reflecting off the water and the ocean is obscure , you need to travel only a block or two from the beach to the @entity74			1
there , you can sit at any of the restaurants or bars on the waterway and watch the boats go by			2
if you 're traveling with children , the best place to go is to @entity81 ; when you are n't being entertained by the chef , you can look out the window and watch boats of all sizes go by			1
international correspondent shares @entity88 tips which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion ? we would go to one of several restaurants , depending on our mood and how much we want to spend			2
i know i 'm going to get in trouble with some locals for making this public , but @entity100 and @entity101 are two very good restaurants off the tourist trail			2
they are a few minutes from the beach in strip malls			0
the price is right , and the meal is always good			0
you can bring your own bottle of wine for a $ 15 corkage fee			0
the bar serves only beer and wine			0
if you want a full bar and great @entity117 food , go to @entity101			0
it is also hard to resist a maître de , who is really the owner , greeting you as if you grew up in the old country together			0
we always order a plate of gnocchi as an appetizer to share with the table			0
it 's wonderful , but it 's too rich to eat as a meal			1
if it 's seafood you crave , then you must go see chef @entity131 at 3030 @entity56 in the @entity133 hotel			1
while you 're there , make sure you congratulate the chef for wining last year 's @entity136			1
he was handpicked by the governor to represent @entity1 and compete against chefs from 13 states			0
i am proud to tell you that chef @entity131 brought home the bacon -- bragging rights for the @entity1			1
speaking of bacon , if it 's meat you 're hungry for and you have plenty of money to spend , order the @entity152 beef at @entity153 in the @entity155 hotel			1
an 8 - ounce @entity152 fillet is $ 65 , but the entire menu is not that expensive			0
you can get a regular 8 - ounce fillet for $ 35			0
aside from the food , a highlight here is the jellyfish tank ; it 's worth , at the least , going to the bar for a drink			1
what is your favorite neighborhood ? i 'm not sure it has a name , but all my friends know where to find me when i 'm in town			0
i call it my favorite beach block			0
it is on the beach and @entity179 , about a mile north of the strip			0
this three - block radius has something for everyone			0
after the sun goes down and you get a drink at @entity64 's , you can walk across the street to the @entity187			1
i recently became the @entity191 " mayor " of the @entity187 , although my mother thinks i should own the place by now			0
the friendly staff has retained me as a loyal customer for decades			0
for many locals , this is our version of @entity197			0
but instead of a @entity198 , we have a @entity199 who can always be found at the end of the bar			0
the parrot is known by locals as a " @entity205 bar			0
" it caters to @entity205 's sports teams , and the place is packed when the @entity209 , @entity210 , @entity211 or even @entity212 has a televised game			1
the extensive menu includes foods that @entity205 is known for such as cheesesteak and soft pretzels			0
even if you ca n't find @entity205 on a map , it 's a fun place where tourists and locals mix. doors away from the @entity202 , you will find a @entity226 restaurant , smoke shop , kava bar , @entity230 coffee shop , tattoo parlors , bar / restaurant @entity232 , @entity235 's homemade ice cream shop and a couple of shops selling t - shirts and souvenirs			1
it 's also where you 'll see my husband every sunday at about 6 p.m. picking up pizza from my favorite spot , @entity241 this beachfront sandwich shop is open 24 hours a day and serves the best pizza in town			2
how do tourists stick out ? knowing a person is a tourist is easy in @entity1			2
i think our engineer @entity252 said it best : " you look for the pink people			1
we used to call them flamingos when i was a kid			0
" i 'm not sure that the term is still used , but the pink people continue to be one good way to tell when someone is in town on vacation			1
if their sunburn does n't give them away , things like a @entity266 shirt or camera around the neck will			2
a tip : save your money on the new shirt and buy good sunscreen ! is there a tourist trap actually worth seeing ? the @entity278 riverboat has been transporting tourists around @entity0 's canals and @entity281 for as long as i can remember			1
the tour guides are funny and informative as they point out the multimillion - dollar homes on the water and the names of famous residents who live there			2
this tour allows you to see these residences from behind the gates			0
they also stop on their own island , where you can watch an alligator being wrestled			0
if you want to see an alligator in its natural habitat , i advise you to rent a car and drive to @entity299 in the @entity300			0
it 's not in @entity0 but worth the trip ! it was only last year when i discovered this spot , and i have n't stopped talking about it since			1
i have never seen so many alligators in one place			0
i was so amazed by what i saw that i wrote a story for @entity2 's travel page			2
have you been to @entity0 ? share your tips in the comments section below .			1

@entity0 's best views are of the water with *cocktails* in hand
do n't forget sunscreen -- the pink people stand out as tourists
get a look at the *glitzy* side of the city from the @entity278 riverboat
