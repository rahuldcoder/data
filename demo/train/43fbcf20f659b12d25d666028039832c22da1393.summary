defense secretary @entity41 , @entity43 chairman @entity42 and other top brass were told tuesday that the trip would happen -- but the logistics of the journey unfolded much the same way that director of national intelligence @entity49 had recently departed on a secret mission to retrieve two @entity26 from @entity52			1
moving quickly and quietly , the @entity37 had gone straight to the @entity53 at the @entity54 -- the group of military planes that includes @entity56 , and which the @entity37 believes it controls , rather than the @entity38 -- with instructions to fly to @entity2			1

the group departed at 5 a.m. and landed in @entity2 at 8 a.m. @entity0 was there waiting			1

also waiting for him : a corned beef on rye sandwich with mustard			1
tuesday night marked the start of @entity80 , so there were also potato pancakes ( or latkes ) with applesauce and sour cream , traditional holiday foods			1

while they all talked inside a building there , by coincidence , the plane of secretary of state @entity115 landed at @entity67 , @entity6 said			0
@entity115 came from his plane to greet @entity0 , giving him a big hug			2
the two sat next to each other on a leather couch watching @entity10 announce the new @entity2 policy			2

@entity0 has a number of health issues and has lost about five teeth while in captivity			0
@entity6 said he is now focused on taking time to work on his health , visiting doctors and a dentist , as well as spending time with his family			0
when the three members of @entity102 were asked at a press conference on @entity142 wednesday why they were picked to serve as the @entity26 delegation to pick up @entity0 , @entity61 joked that " we had frequent flier miles			1
" the lawmakers said they 'd learned recently that a deal was close			0
" it was pretty clear over the last couple of weeks that something was finally coming together , " @entity63 said wednesday			0

two planes -- one to pick up @entity0 in @entity69 and one to deliver @entity2 prisoners released by the @entity26 -- ended up on the tarmac at the same time , @entity63 said			1
@entity0 's wife was emotional on the plane ride to @entity69 , he said			1
" she was tearing up and she asked for tissues before she went in [ to greet her husband ] and she needed them , " @entity63 said			0
