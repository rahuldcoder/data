@entity0 , @entity1 -- fighters pushed sunday to the outskirts of one of @entity7 's last bastions of support , setting the stage for possible clashes ahead of this week 's deadline for loyalists of the ousted leader to surrender			1
@entity1 's new leaders gave @entity7 loyalists in @entity16 , @entity17 and a handful of towns until saturday to surrender or face military force			1
" we 're giving them a chance to come forward and negotiate surrender , " col. @entity21 , spokesman for the @entity23 's defense ministry , told reporters sunday			1
but there were indications that fighters were planning to enter @entity17 , where a powerful tribe is sympathetic to @entity7 , before the deadline			2
one of @entity7 's sons , @entity34 , told @entity2 's @entity35 in a phone conversation that negotiations aimed at a cease - fire had been going well , but that an " aggressive " speech broadcast by his brother , @entity40 , a few days ago caused talks to break down			1
he said he saw no further point in negotiating and believes the @entity23 is ready to go into @entity17			2
@entity23 negotiator @entity44 said the planned talks fell apart after local leaders refused to come to the designated meeting spot -- a mosque outside of town -- and demanded the @entity23 fighters come into the town unarmed			1
" as far as we are concerned , negotiations are over from our side , " @entity44 said			2
" military commanders must determine what the next steps will be			0
" asked his location , @entity34 said he is " a little bit outside " of @entity17 but had been moving around			0
" it seems that his options are running out , " @entity35 said			0
@entity34 said he had not seen his father or brother for two months			0
he said he is " neutral " and not on his father 's side or that of the rebels , but remains " ready to help negotiate a cease - fire			1
" @entity23 fighters positioned outside @entity17 said they remain unwilling to shed blood or fire shots			1
" some tribal leaders and many of the residents have surrendered their weapons , but there are still many loyalists who are protecting @entity7 and his sons , " @entity23 media coordinator @entity75 said			1
the deadline was extended by a week to curb further bloodshed and prevent further destruction , military commanders have said			0
" this extension does not mean we are unaware of what @entity7 's accomplices are up to , " @entity23 chairman @entity86 said at a news conference , countering earlier criticism that a grace period might give @entity7 's forces to regroup			1
but @entity7 's spokesman , who has not been seen since @entity0 fell , said key tribal leaders in @entity17 remain loyal to the ousted leader			1
@entity100 , in a telephone call from an undisclosed location , told @entity101 that the transitional council 's messages " are not being heeded here in @entity17			0
" @entity100 also told @entity101 that @entity7 remained in @entity1 , though he said he did not know where			1
he did say @entity7 was well defended			2
anti-gadhafi forces were positioned around the former leader 's hometown of @entity16 as well as @entity17 , @entity86 said saturday			2
asked to comment sunday on a report that the @entity23 knows @entity7 's whereabouts , col. @entity21 refused to do so			1
@entity111 , interim deputy prime minister and oil minister of the @entity23 , said @entity17 was close to falling			2
" it 's possible , although we are not sure , that the @entity17 ( tribe ) has joined the revolution , and now it 's under control of the revolutionaries , " he said			0
anti-gadhafi fighters from the east pushed toward @entity17 saturday with virtually no resistance			0
they were able to reach @entity123 , which sits on the border of @entity17 province and is home to @entity130 's @entity129 base			0
the @entity53 forces entered the base and arrested three men in civilian clothes they claim were loyalists			0
they also took seven armored personnel carriers			0
@entity111 said @entity1 's new leadership will move their headquarters from @entity140 to @entity0 this week to begin implementing political plans to shape a new future			1
but for the time being , guns trump government on the streets of the capital			0
@entity0 has become a city of checkpoints , weapons and no real authority as the threat of @entity7 's loyalists lingers			1
jittery and suspicious @entity53 fighters blocked a road saturday where a drive - by shooting occurred earlier			2
they collected weapons and registered them at police stations			0
those who called themselves rebels just a week ago were now working with @entity0 's law enforcement authorities			0
with @entity7 's armories emptied , guns -- always in large supply in @entity1 -- have proliferated on the streets			1
those who want to carry weapons now must be issued identification cards , but the selection process is not centralized -- neighborhood councils are making that decision			0
a group called the @entity173 is trying to exert control over the city , creating the potential for further conflict with the established @entity23 in a volatile situation			2
@entity111 announced saturday the formation of the @entity180 , which held its first meeting friday			0
among the priorities for the committee were the protection of public institutions and weapons in @entity0			0
the transitional council , meanwhile , is trying to get @entity1 's oil - dependent economy going again			1
it expects to restart oil production at the @entity193 and @entity194 oil fields in less than two weeks , @entity111 said			0
in related news , @entity195 withdrew its ambassador from @entity1 , saying it does not recognize the @entity23			1
@entity2 's @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 and @entity201 contributed to this report .			2
