@entity0 -- @entity2 might be the most powerful female politician in the world these days			1
she certainly is in @entity4			0
we now know that her cell phone was monitored by @entity8 intelligence , not just since she became the @entity10 chancellor in 2005 , but also for an additional three years before that			1
many @entity8 analysts are now arguing that @entity2 's anger at the revelations is manufactured for public consumption			1
they could not be more wrong			0
a lot of @entity17 were flustered when they learned this summer that the @entity19 had been collecting millions of bits of so - called meta - data on them			0
according to opinion polls , 60 % of @entity17 supported @entity24 's release of classified information			0
just 17 % found what he did was wrong			0
for @entity17 , the discussion about @entity8 surveillance is not a joke			2
in fact , it could n't be more serious			0
we value our privacy highly			0
it is seen as an individual liberty that often could not be taken for granted in @entity10 history			1
both the @entity39 secret police -- the @entity40 -- and the @entity10 intelligence agency -- the @entity42 -- spied extensively on citizens			2
even in more recent decades @entity17 have repeatedly fought battles about privacy and against a perceived " @entity46 " -- or " surveillance state			0
" compared to the @entity8 , @entity48 already has many laws concerning data privacy , but two - thirds of @entity17 would even like stricter regulations			2
back in the summer , @entity2 tried to downplay the @entity8 surveillance herself and stood strong on the side of the @entity8 ally			1
in mid-july , @entity2 gave an interview on the topic , which in light of the recent revelations , seems almost satirical			2
opinion : @entity42 past looms over spy scandal the host of the show introduced her as " the lady who hopes that at least her cell phone is bug - proof , even from @entity8 intelligence services			1
" @entity2 said later in the interview : " i know that i am not being monitored			1
" a month later -- and in the midst of an election campaign dominated by this issue -- the @entity10 government announced that the " @entity19 scandal , " as the @entity10 media called it , was over because the @entity8 had ensured more transparency			1
the @entity10 public 's anger calmed and @entity2 cruised to re-election			1
last week @entity2 learned in a particularly personal way that the issue is far from over			2
she became @entity48 's first @entity19 victim known by name and gave the extent of @entity8 spying a face			1
@entity87 did n't have a lot to gain by bringing this issue to the table again			0
her anger is not simulated for domestic consumption			0
in fact , the opposite is true , since she is now criticized for not taking the extent of the surveillance more serious in the beginning			0
for her to pick up the phone and call president @entity99 to publicly criticise the extent of @entity8 surveillance shows how disgruntled she really is			1
her anger seems real and rightfully so			0
eavesdropping on @entity2 's conversations and reading her text messages is completely unacceptable			2
not because she is the most powerful female politician , but because she is one of the closest allies the @entity8 has in @entity4 and , overall , a trusted friend			2
the latest polls show that a majority of @entity17 supports her sharp reaction ; a quarter even thinks that she has reacted too gently			0
back in the summer , @entity99 said that if he wanted to know what @entity2 is thinking , he could pick up the phone and just ask her			1
in retrospect , this comment verges on the offensive			0
so what benefit does it really bring to spy on @entity48 ? are these benefits really worth the costs ? even if @entity99 has begun a foreign policy shift towards @entity119 in his presidency , he still needs strong transatlantic partners			0
of course , the " @entity123 " -- the @entity10 word for spying on cell phones -- hits close to home for @entity2			1
she grew up in @entity48 where every conversation , every step , was monitored by the @entity42			2
it 's in part because of her past that @entity2 always had a lot of respect for the @entity8			1
she values freedom and liberties and with that the country , which seemed to value these attributes the most : the @entity8			1
@entity2 would n't challenge relationships with the @entity8 if she did n't think it was necessary			1
she would n't endanger the @entity139 data exchange agreement and negotiations on a free trade zone between the @entity142 and the @entity8 , just to demonstrate that she is a strong leader or to strengthen her position at home , which is stable regardless at the moment			2
ever since @entity147 , @entity10 - @entity8 relations have flourished through trust in each other			1
that trust is broken now			0
for the first time it seems , the @entity8 has crossed an actual threshold			0
tapping the phones of ally leaders should n't be a question of " can we " , but rather " should we ? " now it is time for the @entity8 to try to understand those cultural concerns , to show @entity4 that security does n't trump liberty ; that the intelligence services have n't gone wild and , especially , to rebuild the trust of a valued ally			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166			0

@entity10 chancellor @entity2 is *indignant* over having her phone monitored
@entity2 grew up in @entity10 where domestic spying was *rampant*
she respected the @entity8 as *reflecting* her values of freedom and liberty
trust is now broken and the @entity8 needs to show security does not trump liberty
