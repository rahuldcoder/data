they dabble in all forms of trolling , bullying , racism , sexism and other offensive - isms , interspersed with endless spurts of nonsensical chatter			0
any thoughtful comments are typically lost in a roiling sea of " lols , " insults and spam			0
thousands of these comments can follow a popular video , in order of when they were posted but with a handful of the most upvoted comments on top			0
" if some of these comments were spray - painted on homes , buildings or at schools , there would be consequences			0
but online there are almost none , " said @entity30 and @entity31 , the filmmakers behind the popular @entity31 @entity1 channel			0
now @entity1 has a new plan to pull its infamous comments out of the muck and make them more constructive and personalized			1
" when it comes to the conversations happening on @entity1 , recent does not necessarily mean relevant			0
so , comments will soon become conversations that matter to you , " said the company in a blog post			0
" in the coming months , comments from people you care about will rise up where you can see them , while new tools will help video creators moderate conversations for welcome and unwelcome voices			1
" since @entity1 is a @entity57 property , it will start by integrating its existing commenting system into @entity59 , the identification platform and social network @entity57 has been tirelessly trying to make happen since 2011			1
@entity1 commenters will now have to tie their current accounts to a @entity59 account			1
' do n't feed the trolls ' : racism on @entity1 the first major difference is that relevant comments will now automatically float to the top			2
if the maker of a video posts something in the comments , or even just on their @entity59 page , it will automatically be highlighted and placed right under the video			1
the new system also will automatically surface comments from popular personalities and quality threaded discussions			0
" we 're moving from comments to actual conversations , " said @entity1 product manager @entity81 , who compared the new nested comments to a conversation in @entity84			2
@entity1 also is using @entity59 to customize what each person sees based on who their friends are and which other commenters they interact with the most			1
conversations can be made private , so you and your three best friends can analyze the latest @entity99 video on @entity1 without anyone else seeing			2
the site 's final new weapon is a collection of powerful comment - screening tools for video creators			1
there are new filters that will automatically show comments from approved users or entire @entity59 circles and never show comments from blocked users			1
content creators can make a blacklist of any offending words or phrases they do n't want appearing in comments under their videos , and all comments that dare use said words will be held for review			2
" this new feature will allow us to prevent the disturbing comments from ever appearing versus having to moderate every single comment that comes in , so it has the potential to be a huge positive for our company , " said the @entity31			0
of course , the problem of nasty comments is not unique to @entity1			2
it can be found to differing degrees in any online commenting system , especially where there 's anonymity			0
video creators say these types of comment controls are long overdue on all sharing and social media sites			1
previously , if a @entity1 thread got out of hand the best option was to turn off comments			1
but this can be especially tricky for children 's content , such as the @entity31 ' " kids react " series			0
" cyberbullying and hate speech in the @entity1 comments have been a major issue for far too long , " said @entity30 and @entity31			2
" across nearly every video on the site involving race or young children , the uploader has always been pushed into a corner to have to turn comments off entirely or ... ( screen them ) to not let such horrible hatred come through			2
" while some commenters on websites are truly racist or sexist , others are " trolls " who say hateful things just to incite a reaction from others for their own amusement			0
@entity1 recognizes that the new changes wo n't eliminate trolls completely because many people are more than willing to say horrible things under their real names , and anonymity is still an option in the new commenting system			1
@entity1 says the majority of @entity1 commenter accounts are already linked to @entity59 identities , which should minimize backlash			1
anonymity is important for many @entity1 users , such as political dissidents around the world who fear reprisals by their governments			2
to keep people protected , @entity57 will not force them to post under their real names			0
and anyone can choose to continue posting under their current @entity1 handle			0
to test the waters , @entity1 will roll out the commenting system on channel discussion pages this week			1
it will show up on all videos in the coming months			1
for anyone who prefers the current system , there 's still an option to view all comments in chronological order .			0

@entity1 is trying to fix its comments with a new system that ties all accounts to @entity59
video creators will have the power to block specific users and offensive words
previously , the best fix when comments got out of control was to turn them off completely
the *update* will roll out in the coming months
