for many rugby union players the ultimate accomplishment is being selected to appear for the famed @entity4 on their overseas tours			1
@entity7 lock @entity6 is leading the @entity8 in @entity9			0
the @entity4 are comprised of the best players from the four home unions of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 and competition for places in the squad is fierce as club and country loyalties are put aside			1
in the modern professional era , @entity4 tours take place every four years , visiting the southern - hemisphere tri-nations powers of @entity26 , @entity9 and @entity27 in rotation			1
a typical tour will see a series of matches against provincial or regional sides , interspersed with international or test matches			0
midweek fixtures are normally against weaker teams , with the @entity4 giving all their squad members a chance to play , with stronger opposition for the weekend matches which would include the @entity40			0
the 2009 @entity4 are touring world champions @entity9 , looking to improve on the dismal performance of the 2005 side , which visited @entity26			1
under @entity12 's @entity46 winning coach @entity45 , the 2005 squad were expected to prosper , but slipped to defeat in all three test matches against the @entity26			2
the team was captained by @entity49 , but his tour ended after just two minutes of the first test when he was controversially ' spear ' tackled by @entity53 and @entity54 and dislocated his shoulder			0
@entity49 , who led @entity15 to the @entity57 @entity56 this year , was expected to captain the @entity4 to @entity9 , but coach @entity59 gave the job to @entity7 lock @entity6			1
@entity59 has already gone into @entity4 history , playing on the 1974 and 1977 tours , and coaching winning teams to @entity27 and @entity9 in 1989 and 1997			1
he also took them to @entity26 in 1993 where the test series was lost 2 - 1			0
the @entity4 enjoyed their most successful period in the early 1970s with the 1971 team -- inspired by the @entity70 half - back pairing of @entity71 and @entity72 -- triumphing against the @entity26 in @entity26			2
the 1974 @entity4 were arguably the best - known and most successful of all time , winning three tests and drawing one in @entity9 and going through the tour unbeaten			2
under @entity78 captain @entity77 , their uncompromising forward play set up the victories , with their now infamous catch phrase " get your retaliation in first " leading to brutal early exchanges in most games			0
the modern era is a far cry from the first @entity4 tour back in 1888 which visited @entity27 and @entity26 with just 21 players from @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			1
they played provincial and local sides without formal test matches			0
but it had established a precedent , and the 1891 side was sanctioned by the sport 's ruling body the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) and played three tests against @entity9			0
the 1924 tour to @entity9 was the first trip when the term " the @entity4 " became common currency and it has grown from strength to strength since , despite the growing influence of international rugby competitions such as the @entity106 and @entity57 and the @entity107 .			2

@entity4 are selected from @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15
tours now take place every four years to @entity27 , @entity9 and @entity26
selection for the @entity4 is *highly* - *coveted* by leading rugby players
