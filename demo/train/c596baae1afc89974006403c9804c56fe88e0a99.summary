-- " can i have a @entity3 magazine vest ? " the young man , in his mid twenties sporting a scruffy beard and cargo pants , asked			0
" with four magazine pouches , or six ? " the shopkeeper responded			0
a six - pouch vest was sold for $ 27			0
in this market in the center of @entity14 with over 50 shops , you can find anything from used @entity18 army fatigues to @entity21 's @entity20 clam chowder and @entity23 's classic cornbread stuffing mix. some of it is gear thrown away from the largest @entity18 military base in @entity28 , just a 45 - minute drive north of @entity14 , and some of it is stolen goods from the massive convoys supplying @entity18 soldiers around the country			1
in recent years , the market has also been corrupted -- like many other things in @entity38 -- and flooded with @entity40 bootlegged goods			2
but one thing about this market has stayed the same -- nearly four years after the 43rd @entity18 president left office , it 's still named after him : the @entity45			2
as @entity18 voters prepare to choose between @entity48 and @entity50 rival @entity49 , @entity46 fear that the silence over this war during the campaign means it has been relegated further down in @entity18 foreign policy priorities			1
postcard : @entity56 fear what follows @entity18 election " we had high hopes that this war , as the @entity18 's most pressing foreign policy issue , would stir a debate among the candidates , " said @entity59 , a member of the @entity38 parliament			1
" but the war is no longer acceptable to most of the @entity18 -- and the candidates have skillfully skirted around the issue , talking about it based on @entity18 realities and not realities on the ground in @entity38			1
" but for @entity38 , a change at the @entity78 in shaky times during this 11 - year - old war would have clear consequences , just as the war 's evolution since the @entity74 administration shows			1
more : is latest @entity38 attack a troubling first ? @entity46 , says @entity84 of the @entity85 , are watching two issues in the candidates ' agendas			2
" @entity46 are mostly concerned with the candidates ' stance on @entity91 , and their plans and promises for post- 2014 ( @entity18 troop withdrawal ) , " says @entity84			1
the @entity38 and @entity18 governments have repeatedly cited @entity91 as the sanctuary for the @entity98 leadership , from where they lead their increasingly adaptive insurgency inside @entity38			1
a public debate about how each of the candidates plans to proceed in @entity38 after @entity18 drawdown by 2014 is crucial because so much of the country 's immediate fate , particularly economically , is tied to the @entity18 presence			1
postcard : should @entity18 raise fist to @entity111 ? " what has the @entity18 done for my life in the past decade that i can afford to watch the news ? " responded a @entity14 taxi driver when asked whether he is aware of the @entity18 election			1
" i make $ 400 a month in my day job and drive taxi at night -- when do i have time to know who is better , @entity48 or the other one			2
" for years , the vast number of @entity18 military vehicles on @entity14 streets was a daily reminder of the country 's dependency on @entity18			1
today , @entity38 forces have largely replaced them			2
but every time a young @entity38 loses his or her job because a @entity134 company tied to @entity18 's presence here is packing up , the dependency is felt in a more profound way			1
more : @entity139 - on - blue attacks mean no easy way out in the past decade , @entity38 has seen the development of a younger professional class , much thanks to the opportunities of higher education offered by newly opened affordable private universities			2
this professional class answers the dire lack of capacity and speaks to a much - needed generational shift that is necessary in @entity38			2
the growth of the young professional class has happened in a very predatory economic environment			0
the pouring in of @entity18 dollars has inflated the market , creating an unprecedented culture of corruption -- as well as a new elite who believe money can get them everything			0
two former commanders in the north were locked in a heated rivalry over a seat in the parliament during the 2010 election , as a commonly told story in @entity38 goes			0
one of them offered to settle the issue through a peculiar challenge : " let 's start a fire of dollar bills under two separate pots and cook a meal			0
whoever 's cooked first would be the winner of the seat			0
" the story illustrates the new money - fuelled political reality in today 's @entity38			2
a campaign debate over the future of @entity18 's role in @entity38 would make it clear whether @entity185 has the patience to see through the generational shift in @entity38 , leaving it in a more sustainable state , or whether it will leave it cold in its current political quagmire			1
postcard : why @entity193 longs for @entity18 election major campaign developments such as @entity49 's tax releases and the first presidential debate found slots in the @entity38 evening news			1
@entity200 , the country 's largest private channel , picked up @entity203 's criticism on a radio channel of @entity48 's policy in @entity38 -- a manifestation of how curious the @entity38 audience is about their agendas , pouncing on any hint they give			1
@entity203 said @entity48 's decision to withdraw 33,000 troops out of @entity38 had been a political one that put the lives of remaining soldiers at risk			1
" we would never put politics ahead of what our commanders say is necessary to do the job and keep our soldiers as safe as possible when they 're prosecuting this war , " @entity203 said			0
but the print press largely seems disappointed in the lack of debate on the war here			0
" the developments in the @entity235 world and the crisis in the @entity238 's relations with @entity239 over the nuclear program has resulted in @entity38 being relegated into a secondary issue for the @entity18 and the @entity238 , " read one editorial in 8 - @entity230 , the country 's largest private newspaper , last month			1
" experience has shown that forgetting @entity38 is a strategic mistake , " the editorial concluded			0
in @entity38 , where power has been progressively centralized in president @entity247 , it is more important to gauge what he might be looking for in the @entity18 elections			1
the next @entity18 president , whoever he is , will have to deal with @entity247			1
and regardless of which of the many scenarios materialize after @entity247 's current ( and final ) presidential term ends , one thing is clear : he will remain a major power broker in @entity38			1
more : @entity258 refutes @entity247 criticism over the past decade @entity247 has undoubtedly had a much warmer relationship with the @entity50			0
he enjoyed great access to @entity74 until the end of his term			0
a sign of the consistency in their relationship , @entity247 and @entity74 talked via videoconference once a month			0
" the president would have his son , @entity270 , on his lap. @entity272 would be sitting next to @entity74			0
it was quite a warm relationship , " one @entity247 aide recalled			0
when president @entity48 took office , he put an end to the monthly conferences , taking a harsher stance against @entity247 -- one that has clearly backfired			1
@entity247 has increasingly felt the @entity280 have tried to undermine him , particularly when he ran for his final reelection			2
" the president believed they were n't trying to defeat him , but to wound him , " a @entity247 confidant said			0
a wounded @entity247 , with his local legitimacy undermined , would be more obliging of @entity78 orders			0
the messy election went to the second round			0
@entity247 remained in office , but a very changed man in his views towards @entity18 and the democrats			2
@entity294 : five ways to help fix @entity38 while @entity247 might be favoring a return of the @entity50 , @entity38 lawmaker @entity59 believes he wo n't enjoy as warm a relationship even if @entity49 wins			1
" @entity247 's performance in recent years -- his inability to improve governance that is seriously putting the @entity18 project at risk of failure -- means he will be a liability for the @entity50 to have a warm relationship with , " said @entity59			1
a @entity50 return to the @entity78 , @entity59 says , might return the focus to the war against terrorism at a time when a much hyped " peace process " is not bringing results			0
the @entity50 have maintained a much clearer definition of the @entity98 , while under the @entity280 the definition has been blurred during efforts to reach a negotiated settlement to the war			0
but others believe it 's not the @entity50 party of four years ago that would push for continuing this war			0
they want out of @entity38 as much as @entity48 does			2
no matter who wins the november vote in the @entity18 , one thing is clear : the @entity45 in @entity14 is likely to retain its name after the @entity50 who began this war			1
" during the time of the @entity332 , there was a market named after @entity334 , " said haji @entity328 , a retired army officer who owns a shop at @entity45			0
" many years after @entity336 had come to power , the market was still called the @entity338			0

many in @entity14 fear the @entity38 war is no longer a @entity18 priority
*afghans* are concerned with @entity49 and @entity48 's stance on @entity91
@entity347 : @entity247 feels the @entity48 administration has tried to undermine him
