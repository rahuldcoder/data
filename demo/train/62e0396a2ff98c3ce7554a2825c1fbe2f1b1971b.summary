@entity0 , @entity1 -- a colorful platter steams with heat , rising from seasoned fish and an assortment of fresh vegetables all on a plush bed of rice			1
this is @entity1 's national dish and recently my task for " @entity13 " was to search for its origins , prepare the ingredients and taste a sample of the @entity19 culture			1
what i discovered were firm family bonds , handmade artwork and a flavorful surprise			1
@entity26 's westernmost nation hugs the @entity28 coastline and for generations , life in the sea has sustained life on land			1
@entity34 , one of the many fishing beaches of @entity0 , is illustrative of this symbiotic bond			1
as i walk its crowded sandy shoreline , narrow wooden boats approach from the horizon			1
men darkened by hours at sea hop out of the brightly colored vessels			2
@entity44 , red , green , white , all dance along the hull in bold fashion revealing a variety of circular designs			2
these traditional boats are hand painted and crafted by teams of men working in this busy fishing community			1
see also : taking a look inside @entity54 in fact , as i watch with confusion at the apparent chaos around me , a methodical process emerges			2
young boys run up to the boats , placing rollers underneath as the men hand off large coolers of fresh fish , proceeding to push the boat inland			2
the boys , typically sons or nephews of the fishermen , then wheel or carry the coolers to the women in the family waiting on the beach nearby			1
but this is no leisurely endeavor			2
the women work as a sort of broker for their husbands , displaying the best catch prominently			2
i hear empassioned sales pitches in @entity80 as they try to attract restaurant vendors and others searching for a good price for buying in bulk			2
the entire process happens in two waves each and every day , each family member with their own essential role			0
i learned not to get in the way either			0
as i snap pictures of the frenetic scene around me a woman approaches , holds up her hands , reaches for my camera and wags her finger			0
i do n't understand a single @entity80 word she 's saying but the message is clear : " do n't take my picture or i will take your camera			1
" i smile , apologize in broken @entity80 and move on			0
fish is the primary component of " @entity104 , " @entity1 's national dish			1
later i meet with local chef @entity106 as he walks me through a @entity0 market showing me what it takes to bring all the flavors together			1
the key is to only use the best , freshest vegetables ; because they will become a stuffing for the fish			0
how is that stuffing made ? with hard labor , i can tell you			0
see also : sights and sounds of @entity120 once we return to @entity106 's seaside restaurant , he hands me a deep wooden pot with a long , rounded , wooden handle			1
he tosses coriander ( cilantro ) , onions , peppers and spices inside , telling me to get to work			0
i mash , push , pound and pulverize for 30 minutes , breaking a sweat			0
this type of food preparation is common in @entity1 with each member of the family taking on one important role in the food preparation			1
@entity106 prepares and slices the fish into smaller portions each with a slit ready for the stuffing			0
the mashed vegetables are slimy in my hand , a testament to my good work , i think			0
i push them in each chuck of fish			0
@entity106 continues to cook the fish with vegetables inside , as well as surrounded by an assortment of carrots , potatoes and more			0
hours later when he serves it , the taste is divine , far superior to anything i 've ever cooked			0
the appearance may look quite messy but as i 've learned in @entity0 looks can be deceiving			1
this is a culture that begs for closer inspection , something that reveals strong family bonds , a stubbornness for good quality and vibrant , tasty cuisine .			0
