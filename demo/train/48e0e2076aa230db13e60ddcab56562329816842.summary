-- firefighters have stopped the northward advance of the second - largest wildfire in recorded @entity6 history and are now focusing on its eastern flank , crossing the @entity9 border to build suppression lines meant to starve the flames into submission , authorities said monday			1
light winds after dark and an atmospheric inversion will hold smoke at the surface overnight going into tuesday morning , authorities said			1
the @entity19 has burned 706 square miles , officials said monday , up from 694 square miles the day before			1
the fire remains about 10 % contained			1
calmer winds were helping firefighters get the upper hand on the fire , which has been burning since late may , said @entity26 , the operations chief for the @entity27			1
efforts to return residents to @entity30 , part of which was burned in the fire , are under way , said fire chief @entity35			1
" @entity30 is not as bad as a lot of people are making it sound , " he said			2
but he warned that there are dangerous obstacles that must be cleared and utilities to be restored before residents can be allowed back in			2
residents were already moving back to the towns of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 after authorities lifted evacuation orders on sunday			1
authorities warned residents of the towns , about 170 miles east - northeast of @entity48 , that air quality could continue to be a problem , and food in refrigerators may have spoiled			1
but officials with both cities disputed a state suggestion that water supplies might be contaminated			2
" our water is pure , and it always has been , " said @entity42 town manager @entity59			1
@entity61 of @entity43 has made up her mind to return , according to her husband , @entity64			1
she , her daughter and her grandson were leaving @entity48 for home monday morning , @entity65 said			2
" she 's elated to be getting back this soon , " said @entity65 , who stayed behind while his family evacuated			0
the @entity19 is the second - largest recorded fire in state history , having burned across a land mass roughly equivalent to an area one and a half times the city of @entity48			1
the @entity77 / @entity76 fire , @entity6 's largest recorded wildfire , burned more than 731 square miles of eastern @entity6			1
fire officials said sunday that they had turned a corner in stopping the fire , which started as may 29 in the @entity82 , according to authorities			1
@entity65 said he remained in part to keep an eye on the family 's two - acre homestead			0
however , the main reason he did n't evacuate with his family was because his elderly aunt and uncle refused to budge , and he felt compelled to stay and look after them			0
" it was really strange , " @entity65 said			0
" if you chose to stay rather than evacuate , you had to sign a waiver and say you would not leave your property			0
" @entity65 did n't stay home			0
he ventured out into the ghost town , not to disobey but to help out , he said			0
he said he took training to become a runner for firefighters on the front lines			0
among them is his 26 - year - old son , @entity103 , who is a seasonal firefighter for the @entity104 , @entity65 said			0
" he was one of the first responders			0
he 's been working 12 to 16 to 18 hours a day since the fire started , " @entity65 said			2
" i stayed home and fed him every night			2
i think he took ( the fire ) fairly personal			2
" so did @entity65 's neighbors			0
before evacuation , many left signs in the front yards in support of the firefighters			0
" the signs said things like ' we love you			0
be safe ! ' " @entity65 said			0
on sunday , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity123 , a flashing sign posted on the road into @entity42 read , " we missed you			1
" electricity has been restored to the towns of @entity129 and part of @entity131 , southeast of @entity30			0
more than 100 law enforcement officers are working with the incident to ensure public and firefighter safety , as well as protect residents ' property during evacuations , authorities said monday evening			1
