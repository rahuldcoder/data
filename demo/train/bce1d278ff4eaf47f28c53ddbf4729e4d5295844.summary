@entity0 to play baseball with the @entity7			0
it was beyond reality , and it did n't work out for the @entity7			0
he was later traded to the @entity11 who happily increased the deal			0
but at least he was being paid to work			0
@entity16 has now become @entity18 's poster boy -- certainly there will be a lot of strings attached ; but he 's not being paid by @entity18 to swing a club			1

his baseball cap now switches from @entity28 to the @entity18 tick			1
tv ads have already been shot			0
now , i wonder which stable of @entity18 's sports stallions will he join ? will he join @entity35 and @entity36 at causing little or no offenses on or off the field of play ? will he join @entity40 and one day cause a massive scandal putting his @entity18 contract in jeopardy ? or will he join the middle rank of bad boy athletes who 's off the field scandals do n't cost them their @entity18 deal ; think @entity50 or of course , @entity25			1
what 's the difference ? @entity40 is accused of cheating his fans and his beloved sport and cashed in on that cheating			0
but remember , @entity18 actually stood by @entity40 for months in 2012 , when all others headed for the exit			1
