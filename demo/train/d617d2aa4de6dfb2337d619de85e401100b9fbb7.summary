-- there are not many places where @entity3 can escape			1
as one of the world 's most high - profile athletes , his every move is under scrutiny -- especially now after his withdrawal from the @entity10 and this month 's @entity11 has created widespread speculation about his future as a force in tennis			1
he 's one of the most intense men to step foot on a court , and his aggressive , muscular style has contributed to the injuries that have blighted his career in recent years , meaning he has required long periods of recuperation			2
so where does the @entity24 go when he wants to get away from it all and recover from his punishing schedule ? an island paradise he calls home			1
" @entity33 gives @entity3 is tranquility , " the 26 - year - old 's coach and uncle @entity32 told @entity0			1
" he feels comfortable here			0
the @entity36 character is very familiar , not only our family , but most of the @entity36 families			0
" apart from being very familiar , we are people who normally love our homeland			0
we all feel very comfortable here , no ? therefore , for @entity3 it 's normal			1
he 's got his friends here , his family , his birthplace , he 's always had a good grounding			2
" tennis rivals fear for injured @entity3 's future while many sports stars move to glamorous tax havens such as @entity52 , @entity3 chooses to stay close to his roots -- and the beautiful @entity55 island has its attractions			1
from @entity58 to @entity59 and even the @entity60 himself , it has played host to the rich and famous for many years			0
located just off the coast of @entity64 in the western @entity65 , about 209 kilometers south of @entity66 and 241 km east of @entity67 , @entity33 is the largest of a group of islands including @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
with its idyllic mountains , golden beaches and fertile strips of green , it is little wonder that one of tennis ' most successful men has remained in his home city rather than move abroad			2
" it 's true that there are many people that when they 've traveled , when they 've had some success , it 's normal for them to change the place they live , " said @entity32 , who has coached @entity3 since he was a small boy			1
" here in @entity33 it is less normal , because people here feels very attached to our homeland			1
i think that 's the reason why @entity3 is still here			1
first because he loves @entity33 , he loves the sea , he likes being close to the family and his lifelong friends			1
that 's what i think is stopping him from going to other places			2
" injury forces nadal out of @entity11 there 's also the fact that the 11 - time grand slam champion , who won a record seventh @entity110 title in june , does not actually enjoy all the publicity he receives			1
" you know , i am shy , " @entity3 told @entity0 's @entity113 just days after pulling out of the @entity10 due to his ongoing knee problems			1
" i am a little less shy than i was a few years ago			2
that is something that is difficult to lose , but it is something that happens very often for me			0
" i think i have learned a lot the last couple of years and i am able to relax a little bit more when i am with people			0
i enjoy it a little bit more than a few years ago , because i have a little bit more experience , and i have been in the same situation for a lot of times			0
" for some , the whirlwind rise to stardom may have proved difficult to adapt to with constant television coverage , sponsorship deals and attention coming from all directions			0
although he is still adapting to the limelight , @entity3 said he has come to terms with his position and the benefits it has brought			1
@entity3 forced to withdraw from @entity10 " i am a very lucky guy about what has happened to me			2
so i can not pretend to have everything that i have and not have a camera there or not have attention there , " he said			0
" i really feel comfortable with that			0
seriously , when i am here at home i really do n't have attention on me			2
i am a really normal guy and that 's very important to me			0
" @entity3 remains one of the most down to earth sportsmen in the public eye and his desire to escape attention by staying in @entity33 and remaining with friends and family is somewhat of an anomaly			1
those relationships have helped him to remain focused on his tennis and escape the pitfalls that fame often brings			0
" i always like to do the things that i think are right , " he said			0
" i am not trying to be a model , i am trying to be myself and do the right things			0
" if what i am doing is a model , or is an example , is the right example , i am very happy , but i do n't pretend that			0
" the 100th - ranked player who defeated @entity3 since suffering a second - round shock defeat at @entity171 against the world number 100 @entity173 , @entity3 has been suffering with a recurrence of his injuries			1
while the world @entity177 will be resting the tendonitis in his left knee , his rivals will be competing for glory at @entity182			2
having missed much of the 2009 season with a similar injury , this latest setback has been all too familiar			0
@entity3 's disappointment at missing the @entity10 was exacerbated by the fact he had to relinquish his role as the @entity64 flagbearer at the opening ceremony			1
and while @entity3 's presence will be sorely missed in @entity193 , his uncle remains philosophical about his nephew 's future			1
" i said to him that life had treated him well enough to accept this disappointment , " explained @entity32			2
" i said that he 's seen himself in worse situations , worse situations of injury			0
it 's a disappointment , but it 's not the @entity202			0

@entity3 has *shunned* the chance to leave his island home of @entity33
world number three will miss this month 's @entity11 with knee problems
@entity64 admits he has grown to live with his fame despite being shy
his uncle and coach @entity32 backs @entity3 to fight back from his latest setbacks
