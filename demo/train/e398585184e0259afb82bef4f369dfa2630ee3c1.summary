in an embarrassing blow to its perception from an increasingly skeptical public , the @entity1 military thursday retracted a report that nearly all the 129 school girls kidnapped by suspected @entity8 militants had been released			1
just hours after a parent of an abducted girl claimed the @entity11 lied wednesday about all but eight girls finding freedom , the director of defense said the initial report was " not intended to deceive the public			1
" maj. gen. @entity19 's statement did n't indicate how many of the girls were still unaccounted for			1
" the number of those still missing is not the issue now as the life of every @entity1 is very precious , " it said			1

but the principal denied releasing any information			0
" i never made that claim to anybody , " said @entity50 , principal of @entity51 in the northeastern town of @entity53			0

rescue teams , aided by surveillance helicopters , were moving deeper into the vast forest that extends into neighboring @entity84 , said @entity85 , a senator representing southern @entity64 state			2
a broken - down truck believed to have been part of the kidnappers ' convoy was found at the edge of the forest , which suggests the abductors took their hostages into the woods on foot , he added			2
we ' ran into the bush ' the incident began monday night , when militants engaged in a gunbattle with guards at the boarding school , and then herded the students onto vehicles and drove off , authorities said			0
" they left with us in a convoy into the bush , " said one girl who escaped , but , citing security concerns , declined to identify herself			2
" a group of motorcyclists flanked the convoy to ensure none of us escaped			2
" when a truck broke down , the girls inside were transferred to another truck and the broken one was set afire , the girl said			0
another vehicle then broke down and , as the men tried to fix it , " some of us jumped out of the vehicles and ran into the bush , " she said			0
" we later found our way back to @entity53			0
" @entity8 means " @entity128 education is sin " in the local @entity131 language			0
