-- sure , first class sounds swank , but when you 're paying a premium of several thousand dollars a ticket , it can be hard to justify the added expense			1
in an effort to really make it " worth it , " airlines have started offering passengers everything from on - board apartments ( yes , really ) to post-boarding limo rentals and private jet access			1
we 've broken down the top first - class perks to see which carriers offer the best value			1
@entity18 come december , the @entity20 - based airline is taking luxury a step further with the launch of @entity24 on its @entity25 and @entity27 aircraft			1
lie - flat seats ? so passe			0
wealthy customers can enjoy three - room apartments while in the air			1
these suites -- clocking in at around $ 40,000 for a round - trip flight from @entity20 to @entity34 -- will feature a private bedroom , a living room and en suite shower			1
passengers looking for a slightly scaled down experience can book a @entity40 -- a private suite with a full - length bed , separate reclining ottoman and access to a bathroom with shower			1
all suites will come with a private minibar			1
what really sells " @entity50 " is the service			0
passengers will get their own @entity54 - trained butler , concierge , a chauffeur to get them to and from the airport and a private chef			1
while guests can order off the a la carte menu , they can also request personalized dishes anytime			0
emirates @entity62 has announced similar plans to launch a private , on - board residence , though the details have yet to be released			1
still , the @entity67 airline has long been at the forefront of in - flight luxury			0
in 2008 , @entity62 was the first carrier to install first - class cabins with sliding doors for privacy on their @entity74 , @entity75 - 500s and on most @entity76			1
cabins come with a personal minibar , adjustable lighting , private vanity table , mirror and wardrobe			1
guests can avail themselves of a 25 - minute " shower spa " treatment ( though actual shower time is limited to five minutes )			0
there 's also turndown service , where cabin crew convert the seat into a bed with a real mattress			1
and of course there 's the award - winning food			1
in first class , @entity62 focuses on regional menus			2
passengers can expect items like @entity101 caviar or stir - fried lobster in black bean sauce			1
@entity104 passengers craving an extra level of comfort can book @entity104 's new @entity109 cabin			1
these mini-suites -- available on the carrier 's long - haul @entity27 777 - 300 aircraft -- feature lie - flat seats that adapt to each passenger 's morphology , a 24 - inch hd screen ( one of the largest available on board ) , a private wardrobe and an adjustable privacy curtain			1
there 's a reclining ottoman , so guests from other parts of the cabin can visit			2
come nighttime , cabin crew will outfit the seat with a mattress and linens from the @entity133 range			0
@entity104 has also teamed with an army of @entity136 - rated chefs to design its new @entity109 menu			0
it features gourmet touches from @entity144 « l @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143			0
@entity145 @entity145 offers the ubiquitous lie - flat seats , though when it comes time to snooze , cabin crew will set it up as a bed with a sheepskin mattress			2
the seats also have a range of massage features			0
the first class " pods " are also roomy , taking up the space of about four economy seats			2
there are also privacy screens to give passengers that much - needed feeling of seclusion			2
the real draw , however , is the food			0
in a bid to make in - flight dining restaurant grade , @entity145 has teamed with @entity169 chef and tv personality @entity168 to design the menu			2
diners can go a la carte or enjoy an eight - course tasting menu			0
sommeliers are on hand to recommend wine and champagne pairings			0
@entity179 @entity179 's first - class cabins are fairly standard			1
they come equipped with lie - flat seats and an amenity - filled washroom			0
one of the main perks , however , is access to the @entity179 private jet			2
granted , the extra service is n't included , but for travelers wishing to hit up a second -- perhaps more remote -- location , the jet offers a seamless means of transport , minus the rigmarole of layovers			2
@entity179 also tapped a few @entity136 - starred chefs to design its in - flight menus , complete with caviar service			2
the award - winning wine program ( @entity201 ) offers a rotation of vintages handpicked by sommelier world champion @entity204			2
@entity205 in 2012 , @entity206 launched suites aboard its new @entity25 aircraft			2
each cabin features sliding doors and window blinds for maximum privacy			0
eschewing the lie - back seat , the carrier opted instead for a standalone bed that can accommodate two people			0
the cabins also come with a 23 - inch screen and usb and @entity221 ports , enabling travelers to plug in their own devices			0
@entity206 's @entity225 service lets passengers pre-order one of more than 60 dishes			1
some of its more off - the - cuff items include kyo - kaiseki -- a traditional , bespoke @entity233 tasting menu , and wagyu sirloin			0
@entity206 also offers an extensive selection of champagne , grand cru red burgundy and second growth @entity240			2
@entity241 last year , @entity241 brushed up its first - class cabins with the help of @entity245 architecture firm @entity244			1
the airline also sought the input of frequent fliers			0
the results include more spacious personal closets , a thicker mattress and an @entity253 touchscreen controller that makes it easy to adjust the seat and control the lighting			0
passengers are also given @entity259 headphones to better enjoy the in - flight entertainment			2

the @entity265 carrier also recently partnered with the @entity267 to bring five - star dining to the air			1
first - class passengers traveling from @entity265 to @entity34 , for example , will be plied with the likes of foie gras , truffles and chicken and beef accompanied by crab meat and caviar			1
@entity279 @entity279 has introduced a number of minimalist , first class suites on a handful of routes			1
these cubicles feature wood grain interiors and air - weave pillows that act as a mattress when the seat is in lie - flat mode -- that 's soft on one side and hard on the other , thereby accommodating a number of sleeping preferences			1
@entity279 refers to its first - class culinary offerings as a " restaurant in the sky			0
" to drive home the metaphor , the airline has partnered with @entity136 - starred @entity233 chef @entity300			0
while there 's a large selection of @entity305 meals , the @entity233 fare is what stands out			0
even the rice -- provided by brand @entity308 and grown in the mountains -- is high end			0
@entity311 somewhat surprisingly for what was once a low - cost carrier , @entity311 recently introduced @entity314 -- a premium class that offers the only private suites with closing doors in the @entity319 market			1
though the luxury experience is scaled back compared to many other major carriers , so too is the price ( one - way tickets from @entity324 to @entity325 , for example , clock in at a relatively modest $ 599 )			0
when fully flat , the seats , at six feet , eight inches , are the longest in the @entity319 market and have a massage function			1
passengers can adjust the seat firmness at the touch of a button			0
the food in @entity314 is also upscale			1
@entity311 partnered with @entity324 restaurant @entity335 to introduce a choice of swank tapas , such as @entity340 mousse with truffles			0
