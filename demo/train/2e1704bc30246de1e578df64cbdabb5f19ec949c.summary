-- it 's almost like they read our minds ! part of the opening of sunday night 's 65th @entity7 was a mash - up of some former hosts who came to offer " advice " to this year 's host , @entity11			1
it was our best / worst hosts gallery come to life ! last year 's host , @entity16 , popped up first warning @entity11 that he should enjoy the experience and take it all in because " there 's a good chance they wo n't ask you back next year			1
" @entity22 then appeared on stage to complain that she had n't been asked back because she was a woman			0
" come on @entity22 , i do n't think anyone that watched you host that night thought of you as a woman , " @entity11 said			1
2013 @entity7 show is full of surprises @entity31 broke into a tap dance routine as he offered up that @entity11 should do a little song and dance routine like he did hosting the @entity35			1
" that is far too gay , " @entity11 responded			1
he reminded them all that he had actually hosted the @entity7 before any of them			2
but not before @entity39 who appeared to lament " i hosted the @entity7 before all of you			2
back when it meant something ! " " back then , an @entity44 broadcast was watched by over 900 billion people , " @entity39 joked			0
" there was no ' @entity47			0
' " but the best was yet to come			0
" @entity50 " star @entity49 goes into character to let the audience know that " it 's all going according to plan			2
" he mentions the " cherry on the proverbial sundae " right before 2013 @entity56 host @entity55 and @entity57 start heckling @entity11 from the audience			1
" take your pants off and twerk it , " @entity57 advises			0
" i come to awards shows for the twerking ! " sadly , there was none of that as @entity11 said " that would be degrading			0
" " yeah , it would be degrading , but we would be ' de-grateful , ' " @entity55 joked			0
