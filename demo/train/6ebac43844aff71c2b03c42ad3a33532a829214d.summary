-- @entity2 's capital @entity3 now has its first - ever @entity5 bank machine -- and it dispenses @entity6 dollars			1
the machine was installed in late september in the upscale @entity8 , which is located 300 meters from @entity9 in the south - west of the city @entity11 , the hotel 's general manager , said that he had seen people using the new machine but it had not been widely adopted			1
" most of the customers were not aware there is an @entity5 in @entity2 , " @entity11 explained			2
" local residents , most of them do n't have a debit credit or a credit card to use the atm			0
" the @entity6 dollar is " widely accepted " in @entity3 and is used in local trading , according to the @entity26			1
the country 's official currency , the @entity2 shilling , has seen a sustained decline in value following decades of conflict in the war - torn nation			1
@entity35 , marketing manager of @entity36 , which operates the @entity5 , said that other currencies would be available from the machine " in the near future			2
" but @entity40 , senior lecturer at the @entity41 at @entity42 , says that it 's unlikely the bank is aiming for local @entity2 people at this stage			2
" @entity50 will use it for sure , " he explains , referring to people of @entity2 origin who will probably have a bank account overseas			0
" it is likely to be a bit longer before locally based @entity50 start using it			0
" this is the first atm in @entity2 proper , but cash withdrawal machines already exist in the city of @entity59 in the breakaway state of @entity61 , according to @entity36 's @entity35			1
@entity61 remains internationally unrecognized despite unilaterally declaring independence in 1991			0
according to local media outlet @entity64 , @entity5 facilities were available in the city from march			0
more to come ? according to the @entity69 , a @entity68 think - tank focused on @entity70 , more than $ 1.2 billion is remitted to @entity2 each year			0
this is more than half of @entity2 's gross national income , and also more than the total amount of international aid sent to the region			1
while the recently - installed atm could be seen as a sign of progress and stability , @entity40 says it is also an important development for remittance companies , who are also trying to adapt to mobile money transfers and cashless transactions			1
indeed , he described the new @entity5 as presenting " some kind of challenge " to remittance companies			0
however , @entity88 , a remittance company with 286 locations in @entity2 , said they are " in the process of rolling out an @entity5 project " in @entity59 and @entity3 , but that these facilitates would n't " replace the need for our traditional remittance services			1
" while a great many obstacles still exist for @entity2 , it is projects like this atm that illustrate how business confidence is slowly returning to the war - ravaged city			2
