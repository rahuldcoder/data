-- a virus found in healthy @entity4 honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the @entity8 , researchers reported thursday			1
honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the @entity10 , in @entity11 , @entity12			0
colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some @entity8 beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination , such as oranges , blueberries , apples and almonds			1
the @entity8 @entity24 says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $ 15 billion worth of crops each year in the @entity8			1
more than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination			0
signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the @entity8 in 2004 , the same year @entity8 beekeepers started importing bees from @entity4			1
the disorder is marked by hives left with a queen , a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food , but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone			2
the virus identified in the healthy @entity4 bees is @entity42 @entity43 ( @entity44 ) -- named that because it was discovered by @entity46 researchers			1
although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish , bees infected with @entity44 die close to the hive , after developing shivering wings and paralysis			1
for some reason , the @entity4 bees seem to be resistant to @entity44 and do not come down with symptoms			2
scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that @entity44 was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time			1
but the study released thursday on the @entity64 web site , operated by the journal @entity66 , cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors			1
" this research give us a very good lead to follow , but we do not believe @entity44 is acting alone , " said @entity69 of the @entity8 @entity70 and a co-author of the study			2
" other stressors on the colony are likely involved			0
" this could explain why bees in @entity4 may be resistant to colony collapse			1
" there are no cases ... in @entity4 at all , " entomologist @entity81 of the @entity82 told the @entity83 last month			0
" it is a @entity87 phenomenon			0
" bee ecology expert and @entity90 professor @entity89 said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time , pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors			2
researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the @entity8 mainland but are not found in @entity4			2
@entity104 bee researcher @entity103 said thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope			0
" one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind , " said @entity103 , who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite			0
" but in the case of @entity44 , there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder			0
this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest - resistant			0
" bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees			0
" the next step is to ascertain whether @entity44 , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce @entity133 [ colony collapse disorder ] in healthy bees , " said @entity127 , director of the @entity128 at @entity129			1
besides the @entity138 and @entity24 researchers , others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from @entity141 , the @entity142 , the @entity143 and @entity144			0

colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees
scientists *suspect* a virus may combine with other factors to collapse colonies
disorder first cropped up in 2004 , as bees were imported from @entity4
$ 15 billion in @entity8 crops each year dependent on bees for pollination
