the massive street rallies that have swept @entity1 since the weekend present a major dilemma for @entity4 's leadership and the city 's own government			1
@entity4 has called the protests " illegal " and @entity1 's leader @entity8 has said repeatedly that @entity4 's @entity10 leaders wo n't reverse a decision requiring a @entity13 committee to screen candidates in the territory 's first direct elections in 2017			1
the goal of protesters is to change this policy , arguing that the right to vote is pointless if the candidates are picked by @entity22			2
this , ostensibly , yields little wiggle room for a compromise that would allow both sides to walk away from the standoff , say analysts			2
" @entity33 does not want to be seen as someone who ca n't manage a bunch of students in @entity1 , " @entity29 , a professor at the @entity30 told @entity31 , referring to @entity4 's president			1
here we take a look at what might happen next : what chance is there that @entity22 will give ground ? @entity33 has emerged as a hardline leader , with a track record of using strong - arm tactics against @entity46 and @entity47 , and dissidents in @entity4 , said @entity49 , an adjunct professor at the @entity50			1
@entity4 also fears that what is happening in @entity1 will have a domino effect on other @entity4 cities , he added , especially in wealthy coastal areas			1
even with a media blackout , some @entity4 have reportedly been shaving their heads as a gesture of support for the @entity1 protesters			1
" for ( @entity33 ) to make a compromise on @entity1 would be a tremendous loss of face , " @entity49 said			0
@entity63 , director of @entity4 's @entity64 and a one - time translator to former @entity4 leader @entity66 , told @entity31 that protesters were " really indulging in fantasy " if they thought the central government would back down			1
however , @entity29 said there is still some possibility of give - and - take on electoral reform such as allowing more democrats on the nomination committee or by promising to introduce greater democracy in elections slated in 2022			1
" that could be a third way , " he said			0
is @entity22 prepared to sacrifice @entity1 leader @entity8 ? @entity1 protesters have extracted concessions from the @entity22 leadership in the past			1
shipping tycoon @entity82 , @entity1 's first post-colonial leader , stepped down in 2005 amid widespread public dissatisfaction			1
protesters have demanded that @entity8 should follow suit and @entity49 thinks that it 's not inconceivable that @entity22 may give him the boot			1
" it 's a tough situation but i think that there is still room to maneuver on both sides assuming @entity22 decides not to use force and that it chooses to marginalize @entity8 , " said @entity49			1
" he 's a very divisive and unpopular figure			2
" @entity93 , a senior fellow at @entity95 think tank @entity94 , said the best outcome might be to replace @entity8 , " not with a lackey of @entity22 or a democracy activist , " but with a politician like former chief secretary @entity100 or @entity101 , current under - secretary of the environment			0
they both have strong political credentials and managerial experience , she said			0
" the next three years could then be a test case for what a more independent - minded @entity1 leader might mean for the island 's relations with the mainland and provide guidance for further revisions to @entity22 's current limited conception of universal suffrage , " she wrote in a blog			1
what 's the worst - case scenario ? as a last resort , @entity22 could deploy @entity122 ( @entity122 ) troops on the streets of @entity1 , said @entity49			2
the @entity122 has a garrison in @entity1 , with some 6,000 troops and they have reportedly undergone anti-riot training over the border in nearby @entity128			0
the @entity129 , the @entity10 's official mouthpiece , said in an editorial on wednesday , that @entity1 could face " unimaginable consequences " if " @entity132 " were allowed to continue			2
" i do n't think they would use lethal weapons but nonetheless deploying armored personnel carriers on the streets could frighten the demonstrators ( into leaving ) " said @entity49			0
" it would be a last resort			0
the images of tanks rolling down the streets of @entity1 would evoke images of the @entity145 massacre			2
this would be very bad for the @entity33 administration			0
" will authorities just let the protests run their course ? when protests first erupted at the weekend , authorities initially took a tougher line - using riot gear , pepper spray and most controversially , tear gas to try and clear the demonstrators			2
but on monday , sensing their approach was backfiring , riot police retreated , suggesting authorities may allow the protests to run their course or , at least , wait until the tide of public opinion turns against them			2
an unnamed source quoted by the @entity166 that @entity22 had told @entity8 to halt the protests in a peaceful way			0
" you can not open fire , " the source said			0
what has @entity22 said so far ? @entity4 foreign minister @entity172 has been the most senior official to comment on the protests so far			1
he echoed previous statements released through state media , calling the protests " illegal acts " but stressing that @entity22 believes @entity1 has the capability to handle the situation			0
" for any country , for any society , no one will allow those illegal acts that violate public order			0
that 's the situation in the @entity95 , that 's the same situation in @entity1 , " he said in @entity184 before meeting @entity95 secretary of state @entity185			0
the official @entity189 news agency has said that its decision on electoral reform carries " unshakeable " legal status and force , angering protesters who are opposed to @entity22 retaining the ability veto candidates			1
" i think the ' @entity132 ' movement is the @entity1 version of street politics and color revolutions we 've seen in other countries			0
it 's very dangerous , " said @entity202 , a former vice minister of the @entity203 under @entity4 's cabinet			1
" democracy and the rule of law are the pillars of economic prosperity and social stability in @entity1			0
' @entity132 ' has attacked both pillars			0
