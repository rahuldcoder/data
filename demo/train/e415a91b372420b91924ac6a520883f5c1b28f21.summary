-- a @entity2 judge friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival , ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial			1
@entity12 , accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival , is set to go on trial in april			1
ninth judicial circuit judge @entity15 ruled that all were unlawfully obtained			1
he said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors , most concerning police tactics in their interview of @entity12 and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car			1
" in each and every case , this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored , " @entity15 wrote in his opinion			0
" unfortunately , in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands			0
" @entity12 , 44 , is accused of stalking air force capt. @entity33 and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at @entity36 in @entity2 on february 5			1
she pleaded not guilty march 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm , battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon			1
her trial is set for april			0
if convicted , she would face a sentence of up to life in prison			0
her defense attorneys had claimed @entity12 's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress			1
during a hearing held in august , @entity54 heard testimony from , among others , @entity12 , @entity33 and @entity36 police detective @entity58 , who interviewed @entity12 after her arrest			2
@entity54 said in his ruling that when @entity12 asked @entity58 if she needed an attorney during the interview , he failed to answer her question in a " simple and straightforward manner			2
" " there was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as ' formalities ' " during the interview , @entity15 wrote			0
on the audiotape of the interview , there was no audible response from @entity12 on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court , and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police , @entity15 wrote			1
" thus , there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them			0
" @entity12 testified at the august hearing she did not respond to @entity58 's questions because she was confused , @entity15 wrote			2
in addition , he said , @entity87 used " legally impermissible " statements and techniques , including threats , to get @entity12 's statements and consent			1
" well , what you say can change what you 're charged with , " @entity58 said at one point			0
" right now we 're looking at [ a ] possible life felony of carjacking			0
" in a written statement , an @entity102 spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court , and referred questions to prosecutors			0
@entity54 noted that , although @entity12 was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat , she was " subjected to a barrage of questions " beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call			2
" @entity118 had not slept during the preceding 24 hours , " the judge said			0
@entity12 's consent to search her car , @entity15 wrote , " followed illegal police activity , such as a prolonged detention , threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent			1
" prosecutors accuse @entity12 of driving nearly 900 miles from @entity128 to @entity36 -- wearing @entity130 diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following @entity33 from baggage claim to a parking lot			2
her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers			0
@entity33 told police that after she got into her car , @entity12 feigned distress and knocked on the window			2
when @entity33 cracked it to talk to her , @entity12 sprayed her in the face with pepper spray , @entity33 said			2
police said @entity12 was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin			2
@entity12 has said she merely went to the airport to talk to @entity33 , who had begun dating @entity12 's former love interest , @entity149			1
@entity150 , who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps			0
at the august hearing , @entity58 testified that when he searched @entity12 's car , he found maps showing how to reach the airport , maps of the airport 's layout , a buck knife and papers including a letter @entity12 appeared to have written to @entity150 's mother			1
he also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car			0
police previously said they also found a bb gun , a steel mallet , a 4 - inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle			0
@entity12 's attorneys in august filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense , saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders			1
on august 30 , @entity54 granted @entity12 's attorneys ' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed			1
