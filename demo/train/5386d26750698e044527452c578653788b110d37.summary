@entity0 , @entity1 -- from the boisterous crowds of stadia to a noisy assembly of mostly politicians , @entity1 's cricket legend @entity3 faces a new test			1
on the website of the @entity11 , the upper house of the @entity1 parliament , the 39 - year - old is now listed as one of its nominated members			1
" when you get nominated because of your contribution in your field , it 's an honor , " @entity3 said at an event in @entity18 , western @entity1 on tuesday			1
the sporting icon 's surprise selection to the house of elders has drawn a mixed reaction in @entity1 , where cricket and politics are often seen as the opium of the masses			1
" nominating @entity3 to the @entity11 may be a populist move , but it makes little sense , " wrote the @entity33 newspaper in a comment last week			1
the editorial was posted under a page - one headline " @entity43 has a new @entity44 " that announced the naming of the revered cricketer to the national assembly			0
" a nomination to the @entity11 , however , should not be treated as a means of honoring eminent people but as a way to enrich parliamentary debate by having people with expertise in different fields			0
nominating an active sportsperson defeats that purpose , " the paper wrote friday			0
some of @entity1 's sports personalities were also skeptical whether an active player would be able to do justice to legislative proceedings			1
" i do n't know whether he ( @entity3 ) has time to do that because i think he is playing international cricket ; he is playing in all formats of the game , " former cricketer @entity60 told reporters			1
" whether he will have time to do that ? whether he will have time to attend parliament ? i really can not say anything on this			1
" at the same time , many lawmakers welcomed the celebrated batsman -- who has scored more runs in international cricket than any other player in the history of the game -- to their ranks			1
" i am happy for @entity3			2
last time , when i spoke to the media on his birthday , i had said that i hope that government nominates him for the @entity11			0
there is no - one better than @entity3			2
i am happy , " said @entity87 , a leader from the opposition @entity88			0
in march , @entity3 became the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries			1
and last week , he and his wife visited the residence of @entity93 , the @entity94 - born head of @entity1 's ruling @entity95 whose popularity has plummeted because of a raft of corruption scandals in the government			1
critics of @entity95 , which denies any wrongdoing , issued words of caution to the cricket star			0
" @entity3 will perhaps have to guard against being used by political interests			2
he is a silent lone worker , not an activist , " tweeted @entity107 , a former police officer who is now part of an anti-corruption campaign against the federal government			0
@entity3 's selection to parliament comes under a constitutional provision that empowers the @entity1 president to name 12 people to the 250 - member @entity11			1
the nomination , according to the constitution , is extended to people with " special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature , science , art and social service			0
" " unless @entity3 becomes a national voice for clean , organized sports , he would be a disappointment , " @entity107 wrote on her @entity130 website page			2
confronted with subtle hints of political loyalty , @entity3 has attempted to steer clear of controversies over his new role			2
@entity139 , he insists , will remain his priority			2
" i have been nominated because i am a sportsman and not a politician			0
i am a sportsman and will always remain one			0
i am not going to enter politics giving up cricket , which is my life			0
i will continue to play cricket , " he said tuesday .			0
