@entity0 has set sept. 9 as the date for a big announcement			1
what will the company unveil ? " wish we could say more , " reads an invitation sent to media members on thursday			1
multiple reports over the past few months have suggested that @entity0 plans to roll out two versions of an @entity10 6 this year , with screens that are 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches , when measured diagonally			1
is bigger really better for @entity0 ? that would be a massive leap from the @entity14 and @entity16 's 4 - inch screens and an apparent move to battle competitors like @entity19 and @entity20 who have been making bigger phones for years			1
but the " say more " tease prompted immediate speculation that new phones might not be all that 's on the agenda			0
the safest bet is that a long - anticipated " @entity29 " smartwatch will be introduced as well			0
@entity0 was granted a patent for a smartwatch in july and reports have suggested now is the time for its debut			2
the device , which will compete with existing offerings from @entity19 and other top competitors , is expected to have a heavy focus on health and fitness apps			0
the @entity0 event will be at the @entity42 for the @entity43 , a 2,400 - seat venue in the company 's hometown of @entity47 , @entity48			2
@entity0 has traditionally rolled out new iphones in the fall , in advance of the winter holiday season .			0
