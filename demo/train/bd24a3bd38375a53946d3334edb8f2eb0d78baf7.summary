-- revered forecaster @entity1 may have predicted six more weeks of winter , but the fashion world is looking ahead to another season : fall			1
despite more impending snow and ice potentially impacting attendees ' footwear flair , @entity4 will take place february 6 - 13			1
see all of @entity11 's @entity4 coverage @entity12 will be all about @entity13 and wild , wild @entity15 inspiration with fringe scarves , frayed edges , equestrian - inspired boots and blanket coats leading the charge , says @entity21 of fashion forecaster @entity22 , the official trend sponsor of the biannual @entity25			1
the season 's street sense will be inspired by the audacious avenues of @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity31 , says @entity21			0
( @entity33 's @entity32 tiers @entity35 collection for 2013/2014 even took place at @entity37 in @entity38 )			0
on a similar wavelength , @entity21 expects a rise in heritage fabrics like plaid , houndstooth and gingham , but re-colored in bright hues			1
this gives way to the bigger androgynous trend of decorated menswear - inspired shoes , oversized sweaters and tailored sportswear			1
meanwhile , the spring crop top trend is traveling south : we 'll see more cropped pants come fall			1
" crop tops are moving towards more boxy tops , " says @entity21 , citing higher waisted pants paired with short but not midriff - baring blouses			2
" the seasons are becoming less about weather - related clothing and more about key items a woman needs for her lifestyle , " said @entity59 , @entity60 digital director			2
@entity59 says this includes " a wardrobe of coats to lust after			2
" the sportswear trend will continue but not dominate the ensemble ; instead , athletic styling will be used to accent distinctively feminine pieces			0
@entity74 paired sneakers with skinny brocade pants in his pre-fall collection			0
the counterintuitive pairings do n't mean that buyers will abandon their feminine privy toward timeless elegance : pearls as both jewelry and detailing on dress backs and collars will be the envy of every @entity88 - inspired fashionista			2
as for the palette , @entity21 says there will be an onslaught of teal and berry tones that are anchored by traditional colors of caramel , gunmetal and navy			0
