editor 's note : @entity2 is deputy director of @entity3 , a project of the @entity5 , a @entity6 - based organization that describes itself as dedicated to progressive causes			2

@entity2 says the idea that young people do n't care about the health care issue is wrong			1
( @entity21 ) -- as @entity23 returns to @entity24 , back from a recess of contentious town halls on health care reform , one new voice has the potential to break through the seemingly endless deadlock : the voice of young @entity31			1
just thursday , there were more than 880,000 @entity34 status updates posted with the meme of a demand for health care reform , generated organically and spread virally from young people and other @entity34 users across the country			1
some are regarding this as the first symbolic demonstration of young people 's engagement in the debate despite the common , and categorically false , notion that young people " do n't care about health care reform			1
" young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 represent nearly a third of the entire uninsured population , and two - thirds of those uninsured young people reported going without necessary medical care because of costs in 2007 , according to research for the @entity56			2
more than half of all young adults have low incomes ( below 200 percent of the federal poverty level , $ 21,660 for a single person in 2009 ) , and low - income young adults are more than 2.5 times as likely to be uninsured as higher - income young adults , according to the @entity66			0
and contrary to popular belief that young people see themselves as invincible college students who choose to remain uninsured , 56 percent of uninsured young adults between the ages of 19 and 29 are full - time workers who are half as likely to be covered by their employer as older workers			2
millennials regarded health care reform as one of their top concerns during the 2008 election campaign , according to the @entity79 of 18 - to 29 - year - olds , conducted in february 2008 by @entity81			1
whether it is the 25 - year - old freelancer with a pre-existing condition who ca n't purchase insurance in the individual market , the 20 - year - old line cook who does n't receive insurance through her job or the 28 - year - old bank employee who is insured but is worried about the rising costs of premiums , young @entity31 experience the deficiencies of our health care system on a daily basis			1
nevertheless , despite a recent @entity98 survey showing that 60 percent of @entity31 aged 18 to 34 support @entity101 's reform plan , the voice of young @entity31 has been strikingly absent from the public , televised national debate			1
and that silence is a dangerous state of affairs for the larger dialogue around reform			0
@entity31 have the most at stake and the longest to live with the result , and they are often the primary voice of a moral imperative ( the idea that health care reform is not only economically necessary but the just and fair thing to do )			2
without their voices , the health care reform debate will continue to be stalled and hemmed in by older @entity31 who are in a better economic position than young people and who are afraid to change the status quo , despite all signs that it is rapidly failing			1
young people were such a vital force during the election , not simply because of their own voting turnout but because of their ability to reach out to their elders and persuade them			0
and what could be more needed now ? but if health care reform matters so much to young people and their voice is so crucial in the debate , why the silence ? why does it appear as if young people are n't interested in the debate that will inform so much of their future ? well , if we are gauging @entity140 's overall interest in the debate by the aforementioned displays of partisan yelling , screaming and death panel - ing at some town halls , no wonder we think young people do n't care			1
those sideshows were a clear turnoff to a population that voted overwhelming for less partisanship and " drama " in its politics			0
or perhaps it is because this administration did little in the early stages of the debate to engage and activate a " fired - up and ready to go " base of young people that saw health care reform as a top concern at the polls			1
@entity101 rarely highlights the fact that reform would provide protections against price differentials that often result in discrimination based on age and gender			0
or what about the fact that the president 's reform proposal would mean that a young person can be covered up until the age of 26 by a parent 's plan , rather than the current limit of 19 for those who do n't attend college ? this is what young people should have been told			1
but it is n't too late			0
as 2008 showed , young people , like all other constituencies , speak when spoken to			2
as the debate slogs into what is sure to be the most consequential stage of the battle , president @entity101 has a prime opportunity to speak directly to those who should have been the base of this issue all along			0
it is beyond time for the @entity195 , and other organizers working to support reform , to hit college campuses and other community centers where young people can be found , both on - and offline , and empower them to make their voices heard			2
in the meantime , young people are doing it themselves			0
students across the country are beginning to plan their own town hall events and forums , designing health care t - shirts and sending in photo petitions to their elected officials			0
they are demanding real reform and trying to get the health care debate back on track			2
in order to succeed , the fight for bold health care reform needs the enthusiasm , support and perspective of young people			1
and time is running out			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : there 's a myth that young people do n't care about health care
she says young people showed concern about the issue in 2008
she says they overwhelmingly support @entity101 's health care plans
@entity2 : reform fight needs enthusiasm and perspective of young people
