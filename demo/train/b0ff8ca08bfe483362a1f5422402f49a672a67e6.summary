@entity0 -- @entity3 founder @entity2 handed himself over to police tuesday , promptly appeared in court where he was denied bail and left for jail in a police van			1
a judge will now decide whether to extradite him to @entity10 to face questioning over allegations he had sexual relations with two women without their consent			2
he has not been charged with a crime			0
the judge at the @entity18 ordered @entity2 jailed until december 14 , despite several celebrities coming forward and offering to pay his surety , or bail			1
it was not immediately clear if the court would decide on that date whether to release him			0
the judge repeatedly said the case is " not about @entity3 , " but about serious sexual offenses that allegedly occurred on three occasions with two women			0
@entity2 , who was in court with security guards on either side of him and his lawyer in front , initially proved reluctant to declare a home address			1
at the start of the proceedings , @entity2 was asked for his address and at first gave a post office box			2
when told that was n't sufficient , he wrote a location on a piece of paper and handed it to the judge			0
it was later revealed that @entity2 wrote " @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 " on the paper			2
in making his decision to deny bail , the judge cited the fact that @entity2 gave no permanent address and has a nomadic lifestyle , and that he has access to significant funding that would make it easy for him to abscond			1
@entity57 of the @entity58 , a journalists ' organization that hosts many of @entity3 press events and gives @entity3 workspace in @entity0 , said he offered @entity2 an address for bail			1
@entity57 said he was " suspicious of the personal charges " against @entity2			2
@entity66 socialite @entity65 had offered to pay bail of 20,000 pounds ( $ 31,500 ) , and journalist @entity68 also offered a sum of money			0
the media was allowed inside the courtroom initially but was later ordered to leave			0
@entity2 appeared in court after turning himself in at a @entity0 police station			1
he was arrested on a @entity10 warrant			2
he refused to agree to be extradited to @entity10 , so the court now has roughly 21 days to decide whether to order his extradition , said @entity78 , executive director of the @entity79			1
@entity78 was surprised that @entity2 was denied bail , he said			1
but @entity2 will now face an uphill battle to prevent being sent to @entity10 -- showing that he can not get a fair trial there			1
" that is difficult " given @entity10 's highly developed legal system , @entity78 said			1
the @entity10 warrant is a @entity87 arrest warrant designed for easy transfer of suspects among @entity87 states , @entity78 said			1
if the court does decide to allow his extradition , @entity2 will be allowed to appeal that decision , too , elongating the legal process , he said			1
@entity2 , a 39 - year - old @entity48 , has said he has long feared retribution for his website 's disclosures and has called the rape allegations against him a smear campaign			2
@entity10 first issued the arrest warrant for @entity2 in november , saying he is suspected of one count of rape , two counts of sexual molestation and one count of unlawful coercion -- or illegal use of force -- allegedly committed in august			1
@entity10 prosecutor @entity109 said in a website statement that tuesday 's actions do n't represent any movement in the investigation			1
" at present , the case is a matter for @entity117 authorities , " she said			0
@entity109 also said that the arrest has nothing to do with @entity3			0
" i want to make clear that i have not been subjected to any kind of pressure , neither political nor of any other kind , " she said			0
" i am acting as prosecutor because there are suspicions of sex crimes committed in @entity10 in august			2
@entity10 prosecutors are completely independent in their decisions			0
" @entity2 's @entity10 lawyer , @entity129 , told @entity1 affiliate @entity130 that his client is innocent			1
" yes , i think that @entity2 will soon be set free if all applicable laws are followed , " @entity129 said			1
" the prosecutor wants @entity2 to be arrested because he did n't participate in an interrogation			2
but once this interrogation has taken place , there wo n't be any more reason to keep him , so then he should be set free			1
" @entity139 , the @entity10 lawyer representing the two women who have accused @entity2 , said he is " very relieved , above all , on behalf of my clients			1
" " now we are just waiting for the next step which is for him to be handed over to @entity10 , " he said			0
the @entity48 high commission in @entity0 said tuesday it was providing consular assistance to @entity2 as it " would to any @entity48 under arrest			2
" a spokesman for @entity3 said tuesday the legal proceedings in @entity0 had not affected the site , which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information			0
" @entity3 is operating as normal , and we plan to release documents on schedule , " spokesman @entity153 said			0
@entity3 has been under intense pressure from the @entity158 and its allies since it began posting the first of more than 250,000 @entity162 documents november 28			0
since then , the site has been hit with denial - of - service attacks , been kicked off servers in the @entity158 and @entity166 , and found itself cut off from funds in the @entity158 and @entity169			0
in response , the site has rallied supporters to mirror its content " in order to make it impossible to ever fully remove @entity3 from the internet			0
" more than 500 sites had responded to the appeal by monday evening , it said			0
@entity3 has also posted a massive , closely encrypted file , identified as " insurance " -- a file @entity2 's lawyer has described as a " thermonuclear device			1
" @entity2 has said the more than 100,000 people who have downloaded the file will receive the key to decoding it should anything happen to him or should the site be taken down			0
" the insurance file will only be activated in the gravest of circumstances if @entity3 is no longer operational , " @entity153 said			0
@entity1 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
