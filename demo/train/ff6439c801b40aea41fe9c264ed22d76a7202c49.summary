-- a piece of space debris left over from a 2007 @entity5 missile test collided with a @entity7 satellite earlier this year , rendering the satellite unusable , a researcher said saturday			1
the collision appears to have happened january 22			1
that 's when it 's thought a piece of the @entity14 weather satellite , which was destroyed in the 2007 missile test , accidentally hit the @entity7 satellite , said @entity16 , a senior research astrodynamicist at the @entity17			1
the collision changed the orientation and orbit of the @entity7 satellite , which was being used in scientific experiments , @entity16 said			1
it may have also damaged it			0
" there has been a piece of debris catalogued by @entity27 as a result of that collision , " @entity16 said			2
" that would suggest that at least a part of the satellite broke off because of the collision			2
" it was february 4 when two scientists with the @entity36 in @entity37 noticed a change in the orbit of the satellite , known as @entity41 , @entity16 said			0
the scientists estimated the change happened january 22			1
they contacted @entity16 because @entity17 operates a service that looks for close satellite approaches , he said			0
@entity17 looked for objects that may have had a nearby approach with the @entity41 satellite around the time of the collision			2
the @entity5 debris was the only object they found			2
although the predicted distance between the debris and the satellite seemed to preclude a collision , the fact that the close approach happened within 10 seconds of the change in orbit made the @entity14 debris the likely culprit , @entity16 wrote in a blog post			1
@entity17 is now working with the @entity7 scientists to find out more about the collision			2
@entity41 is a small glass sphere that reflected laser beams for research			1
because of the collision , the satellite now faces the wrong way and ca n't be used , @entity16 said			2
the collision also sped up the satellite 's spin period from 5.6 seconds to 2.1 seconds , @entity16 said			0
@entity5 launched the @entity14 polar orbit weather satellite in 1999			1
it was destroyed in 2007 when @entity5 targeted it for a test of a ground - based , medium - range ballistic missile			1
@entity80 tracking sensors determined the missile collision created hundreds of pieces of space debris , according to a @entity80 official at the time			1
the test prompted formal protests from the @entity80 and several @entity80 allies including @entity89 and @entity90			0
the problem of collisions involving space debris is not a new one			1
" collisions happen all the time , everywhere			0
big collisions -- now those are the rare ones , " said space debris expert @entity96 , chairman of the @entity98 at the @entity99			1
the last major space debris collision was in 2009 between @entity103 33 , an operational @entity80 communications satellite , and @entity105 , a decommissioned @entity7 satellite , @entity16 said			1
scientists know of only a handful of such collisions , but that 's only because they happened with objects that were being monitored			0
@entity16 and @entity96 say it 's likely there are other " junk to junk " collisions involving unmonitored objects that no one knows about			2
in the case of the @entity7 satellite in january , " it would have been very difficult to tell there had been a collision if it had n't been for the fact that somebody was operating the satellite and noticed a collision , " said @entity16			1
experts and leading government agencies have been working on the space junk problem for decades , but it 's a tricky one to solve , @entity96 told @entity0			0
trying to catch or deflect debris runs the risk of making the problem worse , he said			0
the debris could shatter into more pieces or change orbit and be on a collision course with something else			0
some soft - impact lasers can nudge objects into a calculated orbit toward @entity144 so they will be pulled down and burn up in the atmosphere , @entity96 said			0
but scientists must make sure that happens over an ocean to minimize danger to people			0
" our technology has not caught up with our desire to clean up our mess " in space , @entity96 said			0
" if nothing else , " said @entity16 , this collision " was a bit of a reminder that it will likely happen again , and maybe we should get back to work trying to figure out what to do about it			0
" more space and science news on @entity0 's @entity165 blog rare naked - eye comet now visible 501 days in space with your spouse : could you do it ?			0

the collision has rendered the @entity7 satellite , used to reflect laser beams , unusable
the debris is left over from a 2007 @entity5 missile launch on their own weather satellite
the collision happened january 22 but was only discovered last month
