@entity6 's " @entity5 " is an exceptional film			1
it has been picking up awards since winning the @entity9 at its world premiere at the 2011 @entity11 and is one of the front - runners for best foreign language film at the upcoming @entity15			1
@entity16 ( @entity17 ) and @entity18 ( @entity19 ) are a married couple in trouble			1
@entity18 wants to leave @entity22 with her husband and daughter @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , but @entity16 refuses to leave his ailing father ( @entity26 )			1
as a result , @entity18 sues @entity16 for divorce			1
but unless @entity16 either agrees to a divorce or permits @entity18 and @entity24 to go without one , @entity18 can not leave the country with her daughter			1
@entity16 refuses to give his permission and @entity18 moves out , choosing to live with her parents while continuing to try and get her husband to agree to either come with them or allow @entity24 to go			1
however , it 's not clear that their daughter even wants to leave and she chooses to stay with her father when @entity18 leaves			1
" @entity5 " is a family drama , a mystery and an exploration of modern @entity44 society			2
it 's a deeply political film that hides its politics in every day occurrences			2
it 's also a story that on some levels could be played out in any society and yet it reads as a very @entity44 tale			0
this is a society about which @entity52 know very little yet one that is , on the surface , easy to relate to			0
@entity16 and @entity18 appear to be relatively secular			1
they are a modern , well - to - do , intellectual and cosmopolitan couple			2
so when @entity16 hires @entity59 , a deeply religious , working class woman to care for his father who has advanced @entity61 's , it sets in motion a rather unexpected whodunit of sorts			1
@entity59 is repeatedly presented with dilemmas that challenge her faith and require her to call her spiritual adviser for guidance			0
for example , while her religion forbids her to touch a man who is not her husband , she is caring for an elderly and sick man			0
surely she is allowed a dispensation for charitable or compassionate works ? while her @entity77 assures her that this is indeed acceptable , the situation proves too much for @entity59 who suggests to @entity16 that her unemployed husband @entity78 ( @entity79 ) might be a better fit			2
unfortunately , @entity78 is arrested for being in debt before he can start work and @entity59 must return			0
from day one she seems , for lack of a better word , squirrely			0
she 's obviously hiding something from @entity16 and when he returns to the apartment one day to find his father non-responsive , on the floor and tied to the bed , he loses his temper and things go pear shaped			2
here 's where the mystery kicks in and things get complicated , but to reveal any more would deprive you of watching this film unfold			2
while the relationship between @entity16 and @entity98 is still front and center , so too is the story behind what happened to @entity16 's father and the aftermath			1
who is lying and why ? who did what to whom ? the answers to those questions lie in explorations of @entity22 's social , religious and political customs and serve to deepen the emotions that run through this film			2
i feel like a broken record , heaping praise on " a separation , " but i really ca n't find anything wrong with it			0
my natural instinct is to try and bring some sort of balance to a review			0
find a crack in the armor of a great film or some small bit of light in a dreadful one , but there is really nothing to criticize here and i get the feeling that upon a second viewing , it may rise even higher in my various top 10 lists			0
@entity17 , @entity19 and @entity136 are all deeply convincing and moving actors			1
a true strength of an actor 's performance is when the viewer does n't understand a word of dialog and is still moved			0
@entity6 's direction and screenplay ( the final 10 minutes of the film is among the best endings i 've ever seen ) combined with the brilliant work done by the performers , make this one of the truly great films of this year or any other			0
a separation is rated @entity152 ( parents strongly cautioned )			0
it contains some family dynamics of an emotional nature .			0
