the @entity0 got its @entity2 wish to # @entity3			0
@entity4 is now being sent to live at a @entity6 animal sanctuary			1
the @entity9 @entity8 shepherd tugged at collective heartstrings last week when it was revealed he could be euthanized due to a stipulation in his late owner 's will			1
but @entity4 will go to @entity16 , the group revealed on its blog tuesday			2
" we are thrilled to announce that @entity4 has been released to @entity16 and we are currently arranging his transport to our sanctuary in @entity22 , @entity6 , " wrote @entity18 , vice chair of @entity16			1
people across the country learned of 9 - year - old @entity4 's story through media reports last week that emphasized a provision in the will of his owner , @entity30 , that said the dog should be put to sleep and his ashes placed with @entity37 's ashes if a suitable home could n't be found for @entity4			1
the social media hashtag # @entity40 was born after the public expressed outrage at @entity37 's request to put down a healthy dog			1
" add me to the list of people who would gladly adopt @entity4 and give her a happy home			2
please # @entity3 from her dead owner 's stupidity , " one woman wrote			1
however @entity54 , @entity30 's attorney , said outsiders did n't know the whole story			0
before her death on november 25 , @entity30 worried that @entity4 's aggressive behavior could pose a danger to other people			1
" he could cause damage and inflict bodily harm on strangers , in particular , children , " @entity54 told @entity62 affiliate @entity61 in @entity63			0
" when ( @entity30 ) died , she died at her home and the dog was in there			0
no one could enter the house because they were concerned the dog would attack			0
" the dog was housed in a special kennel at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity9 , until a decision could be made			1
@entity30 's will left the option to send @entity4 to the @entity6 animal sanctuary or to put him to sleep up to a close friend			1
@entity30 stated that if it was cost prohibitive or otherwise impossible to send the dog to the shelter , he should be put down and laid to rest with her , according to her attorney			1
" @entity90 and her designated friend , charged to decide what was best for @entity4 , were unaware of @entity16 experience in providing appropriate care for dogs like @entity4 , " @entity88 , a shelter representative , told @entity61 after it was revealed that the dog would be saved			1
before the decision was reached , @entity90 maintained that everything about @entity30 's request was legal			0
" the dog was being owned by my client and now it 's part of her estate , " he told @entity61			2
" and those are her wishes , as far as the future of the dog is concerned			0
outsiders do n't have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client 's will and impose what they want			0
" the case has raised ethical questions about how much control the deceased should have over the lives of their pets			0
" on the whole , we do n't allow people to euthanize healthy pets , " said @entity121 , a professor of ethics at @entity123			0
on the other hand , he said , it 's not uncommon for unwanted pets to be euthanized			2
" as a matter of policy , do we really want people to control the life of a healthy pet on a whim ? " he pondered			0
" assuming the dog is healthy and will be cared for , i 'm not sure we want to encourage this			2
" @entity16 said in its blog post that it 's time for a new hashtag : # @entity143 -- but he is n't out of the woods yet			0
" of all those party to the unfolding events following @entity30 's passing , @entity4 has experienced the trauma of losing his life - long companion and his home			2
our first priority is to do everything we can to make @entity4 's life whole once again in keeping with @entity30 's wishes for her beloved dog			1

# @entity40 started after the public learned a healthy @entity9 dog might be euthanized
in her will , @entity4 's late owner asked that the dog be put to sleep and laid to rest with her
a @entity6 animal sanctuary has agreed to take the dog
