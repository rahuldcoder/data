-- oh there been times that i thought i could n't last for long but now i think i 'm able to carry on it 's been a long , a long time coming but i know a change gon na come , oh yes it will			1
— @entity7 while many @entity9 continue to live on the " outskirts of hope , " we still have reason to believe " a change is gon na come			0
" president @entity15 's snarky comment in 1987 that " we waged war on poverty , and poverty won " was inaccurate and inhumane			1
poverty is different , less widespread , and much less prevalent among older @entity9 now than before @entity20			1
i know that from my own experience , my family 's experience , and the experience of the people i grew up with			1
a recent study by @entity28 confirms that experience : adjusted for inflation , poverty fell from about 26 % in 1967 to 16 % in 2012 as a result of anti-poverty government policies and support			1
yet , at the same time , the share of earned income available is shrinking in the private sector			0
the end result is fewer poor because of government 's safety nets , but more and more people living on the brink of poverty because they do n't have access to the wealth from our recovering economy			1
contrary to what some affluent , arrogant and ignorant pundits are saying , president @entity51 's @entity50 had nothing to do with the expansion of welfare as we used to know it -- @entity57			1
the major war on poverty programs were about education , empowerment and the elderly — @entity63 , student aid and @entity65 , to name a few			1
growing up around poor whites and @entity67 in @entity68 , @entity51 understood that poverty in @entity9 does n't only have a black face			1
he launched the war on poverty in @entity73 , and later spoke movingly to @entity74 about the @entity76 - @entity9 students whom he had taught as a very young man , saying : " my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast and hungry			1
and they knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice			2
they never seemed to know why people disliked them , but they knew it was so because i saw it in their eyes			2
... and somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child			2
" fifty years later , in the photographs of @entity51 talking with poor families in @entity73 , we see that he is really listening to them -- they are not strangers to each other			1
they are n't props for photo - ops			0
he has known these people all his life			0
and he never forgot where he came from			0
@entity113 , in her autobiography , " @entity112 -- take my hand , " tells how @entity51 sought her counsel on his civil rights and poverty programs			1
when she called @entity51 , or left a message at the @entity122 front gate , he promptly called her back			1
he was open , humble , and genuinely seeking guidance in attacking poverty			2
we have become bound by a political straitjacket that frames every debate : too much federal government			0
yet our forefathers forged this system for us			0
the federal government can accomplish what the states , acting alone or even in concert , can not			0
poverty is a national issue and needs a federal response			2
after all , @entity9 federal government policies helped produce massive income inequality by lopsided breaks for the super wealthy			0
since the ' 70s , government policies have driven the economic benefits that produced the biggest income gap between the top 1 % and the bottom 90 % since the @entity143			2
for the first time in @entity9 history , the bottom 90 % earn less than 50 % of the nation 's income			2
even the rich , 52 % of them , tell pollsters the economic system favors the wealthy			2
the untold secret driving the obstruction to @entity154 's economic equality agenda is this : the opposition is n't really battling @entity156			1
the opposition is protecting an economic system that 's putting more and more of the earned income out of reach for those aspiring to better themselves			1
helping the poor does n't mean redistributing the wealth			2
it means removing the breaks that give the wealthy an advantage so huge that big chunks of the nation 's income are automatically removed from individual economic competition			1
we do n't have to frame every debate as right vs. wrong , left vs. right			0
adjusting a wayward economy 's tilt to the wealthy should n't be an either - or , despite some pundits ' delight in false dilemmas			0
even the weather gets treated as " i win - you lose			0
" the mentality that we can " come together " does n't exist today			0
but there 's nothing wrong about working to further reduce poverty , or giving all @entity9 a fair shot at working their way up			1
we , as a nation , have moral imperatives			0
we need to recognize that no one has all the answers			0
we need to agree that income inequality is a problem , that in the wealthiest nation on earth , people should not be both working and starving			0
members of @entity74 who obstruct our meeting the needs of the people need to return to their hometowns as private citizens			0
trust me , " a change is gon na come			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity209 says while poverty has *decreased* , it has taken on a new form
@entity209 : @entity51 knew what poverty looked like among poor whites and @entity67
