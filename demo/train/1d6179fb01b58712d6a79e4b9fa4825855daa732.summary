i am something very quiet			0
i only wanted to live with my pictures , " he says			0
the vast stash of paintings found in the apartment by the likes of @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , some previously unknown , others that had been presumed lost forever , is thought to be worth upwards of $ 1 billion			1
his father @entity38 who was partly @entity39 , survived the war as one of only four " degenerate art " dealers permitted by @entity43			1
@entity48 , by all accounts a savvy wheeler and dealer , removed the huge collection from his house in @entity51 during the devastating bombing in the final days of @entity53 , and moved it to what later became @entity55			1
" my father knew ... the @entity57 were coming closer , " he tells @entity11			1

it would not have been good for him			0

" i never had anything to do with the acquisition , only with saving them			0
" @entity9 never married , never made friends , and eventually moved to @entity18 with his mother when he was 27			1
until she and his sister @entity77 died in recent years , he had never lived alone			2
