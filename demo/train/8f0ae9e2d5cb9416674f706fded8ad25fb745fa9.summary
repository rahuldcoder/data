@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 and @entity5 challenger @entity4 face off tuesday in the second of their three debates , this one in a town hall - style setting in which they 'll take questions from likely voters			1
the stakes could n't be higher : @entity3 must get his campaign back on track after a poor performance in the first debate that left @entity19 demoralized and @entity3 's lead evaporating both in national polls and those in key battleground states			1
for @entity4 , who polls among voters showed won the first debate overwhelmingly , a second strong performance would boost his momentum going into the third debate next monday and the final two weeks before @entity29			1
here are five things to watch for on tuesday : 1			0
connecting with the audience unlike the first presidential showdown in @entity36 two weeks ago , this debate will include a town hall audience of approximately 80 undecided voters , some of whom will get the chance to ask questions to the two candidates			1
it 's a completely different dynamic than the first face - off between the president and the @entity5 nominee			2
" the challenge is that they 've got to connect , not just with the people that are looking into the television and watching them , but to the people that are on the stage with them , " the debate 's moderator , @entity2 chief political correspondent @entity51 , said			1
get instant updates on @entity2 's live blog " they have to keep those folks in mind			2
it 's a much more intimate and up close adventure with voters			2
the candidate that makes a connection with the person asking the question is also making a better connection with the person back at home , " added @entity51 , who 's also the host of @entity2 's " @entity64			2
" with no podium to hide behind in tuesday 's debate , the candidates ' style and body language will be in the spotlight			1
if you do n't think this matters , flash back 20 years to the first town hall - style presidential debate when then - president @entity83 repeatedly checked his watch			2
it was a sign , some thought , that the incumbent would rather have been anywhere else than debating @entity19 challenger @entity89			0
the @entity91 governor highlighted his ability to connect to voters by walking towards the town hall audience when answering a question about the recession			1
@entity19 strategist and @entity2 contributor @entity97 , who was chief strategist for @entity89 's campaign , agrees with @entity51 on the importance of connecting with the audience			1
" if you do that -- with empathy , compassion , understanding and cool strength -- you will win the debate and the election , " said @entity97 , who 's a senior adviser for a pro-obama super pac			1
@entity111 : stakes enormous in second debate 2			2
find a warm place after a lackluster performance in the first debate , it 's obvious the president needs to step it up in @entity120			1
even @entity3 himself admits he was flat in the face - off in @entity36 , telling @entity123 , " i had a bad night			1
" the big question is how aggressive will the president be in this second showdown ? @entity3 needs to look like a fighter			2
the normally cool president needs to heat it up , but he ca n't come off looking overly aggressive or negative			0
that might smack of desperation			0
do n't go from being too passive in the first debate to too aggressive in the second , " @entity97 cautioned			2
" you need the @entity135 : not as cool as the first debate , not as hot as vice president @entity137			2
" poll : debate - watchers split on who won vp debate making @entity3 's task even tougher is the debate format			1
many of the questions from the audience of undecided voters may focus on the president 's record the past four years , forcing @entity3 to defend himself in front of the crowd , before attempting to pivot to criticizing his @entity5 challenger			1
it 's a delicate dance			0
but @entity97 says @entity3 can learn from @entity137 's performance at last week 's vice presidential debate by emulating " @entity137 's combination of facts with common sense			1
" and we 're also going to watch to see if the president plays the empathy card			0
" @entity3 needs to connect the struggles and sacrifices his family made to the struggles families in the town hall audience are going through			1
@entity4 ca n't do that , " @entity97 added			0
opinion : do facts matter ? 3			0
getting women 's issues into the conversation @entity3 pollster @entity172 released a harshly worded memo on monday attacking the @entity175 organization over a new poll , released in tandem with @entity178 , that showed @entity4 now tied with @entity3 among women voters			1
after months of leading @entity4 by double digits among women , his lead among female voters has effectively vanished , if you believe that poll			0
@entity172 savaged @entity175 's methodology and dismissed the poll as an outlier			0
he 's correct that no other survey has shown @entity4 performing that well among women			2
but for @entity192 's sake , he better be right			0
along with his impenetrable lead among @entity194 and a near total hold on @entity197 voters , @entity3 has led @entity4 all year thanks to his robust support among women			1
if that disappears , so do the president 's re-election hopes			0
what does this mean for tuesday night ? women - specific issues -- topics like abortion , contraception , child care , education -- did not come up at length in the first @entity3 - @entity4 showdown			1
@entity3 ad 's @entity214 focus they did in the vice presidential debate , however , and @entity4 running mate @entity218 scored poorly among women in debate - watching focus groups when he explained @entity4 's opposition to abortion rights			1
if @entity3 hopes to lock in his lead among women , he must find a way to get issues like abortion and contraception in the spotlight in order to draw a sharp contrast with @entity4			1
strong performance pays off -- literally a strong debate showing does n't just move numbers , it raises money			1
@entity4 's energetic performance in @entity36 -- which voters judged as a clear win , polls showed -- accomplished something very important for the @entity5 nominee			2
in short , his supporters now like him			0
test yourself : debate trivia before the debate , according to a @entity248 / @entity123 poll out monday , fewer than half of @entity4 supporters said they were " very enthusiastic " about his candidacy			0
today , the " very enthusiastic " number is up to 62 % among likely voters			0
that 's crucial for @entity4 , who needs a fired - up base of supporters to show up on @entity29			0
but the more immediate post-debate impact was financial : @entity4 raised more than $ 12 million online in the 48 hours after @entity36 , his campaign announced just a few days after the debate			0
and if a campaign is rolling out fundraising data before the federal deadline for financial reports , you know they 're feeling good			0
on top of that , the campaign said it raised $ 27 million online from low - dollar contributors in the first two weeks of october			0
strong debate leads to fund - raising windfall for @entity4 that 's good money for a campaign currently engaged in an all - out television ad blitz in key swing states			1
both campaigns are in the process of emptying their war chests for the final three - week push before @entity29			0
a burst of online donations means an extra tv ad here and a final volley of mail pieces there			0
in a race this tight , every little bit counts			0
watch out for the wild card the economy is still issue no. 1 for voters in this election			0
foreign policy and national security have also crept into the discussion , with tensions in the @entity301 slightly eroding @entity3 's edge over @entity4 on the commander - in - chief question			1
but unlike in the previous two debates , when editorial control rested in the hands of the moderator , monday 's debate is a town - hall style forum , in which the audience , about 80 undecided voters from @entity311 , will be the ones generating questions for the candidates			1
that means there 's a real chance @entity3 and @entity4 will have to talk about something that might not have come up in their exhaustive debate prep sessions			1
a question on affirmative action ? funding for aids - relief efforts overseas ? guns ? @entity329 head - trauma ? is that @entity331 guy from " homeland " really a terrorist ? theoretically , anything is on the table			0
the moderator , @entity51 , and her team will have final say over the submitted questions			0
but with regular people in the mix , there 's always potential for a wild card that could throw one or both of the candidates off his game			2
are you voting ? tell us why on @entity350			0

how well candidates connect with audience *members* could affect outcome
@entity3 must overcome passive first performance without *overdoing* it
women 's issues are one area @entity3 must exploit if he wants to maintain their support
strong debate will result in flood of contributions , much needed in stretch run ad blitz
