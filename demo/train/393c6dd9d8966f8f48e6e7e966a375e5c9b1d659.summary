-- @entity2 's state oil company rejected criticism from a leading human rights group wednesday , calling an @entity6 report " inaccurate			1
" file image of @entity9 's oil and gas terminal on @entity10 in southern @entity2 's @entity11			1
" we have issues with the report , " said @entity12 , a spokesman for @entity13			0
@entity6 said tuesday that pollution and environmental impacts from the oil industry in the @entity11 are creating a " human rights tragedy " in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood			1
governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems , @entity6 said in its report , called " @entity29 in the @entity11			1
" but the state oil company said it was local communities who cause much of the environmental damage by vandalizing pipelines for monetary gain			1
" we take environmental damage very seriously , " @entity12 said			0
" pipeline damage is a major cause of pollution , " he argued , blaming " communities who ... vandalize pipelines and make claims on the oil company operating in the area			1
" @entity6 leveled a wide range of charges in its report			0
" people living in the @entity11 have to drink , cook with and wash in polluted water , " said @entity49 , who co-authored the report			1
" they eat fish contaminated with oil and other toxins -- if they are lucky enough to be able to still find fish			0
the land they farm on is being destroyed			0
" after oil spills , the air they breathe smells of oil , gas and other pollutants			0
people complain of breathing problems and skin lesions , and yet neither the government nor the oil companies monitor the human impacts of oil pollution			2
" the report looks at oil spills , gas flaring , waste dumping and other environmental impacts from the oil industry			1
the majority of the evidence in the report relates to @entity9 , the main oil company operating in the region			1
" despite its public claims to be a socially and environmentally responsible corporation , @entity9 continues to directly harm human rights through its failure to adequately prevent and mitigate pollution and environmental damage in the @entity11 , " @entity49 said			1
a @entity9 spokesman said the company shares @entity6 's concern for the people in the @entity11 but disputes the group 's assessment of its corporate accountability			1
" we feel that the root causes of the @entity11 's humanitarian issues are poverty , corruption , crime , militancy , and violence			2
this report does not acknowledge these issues to any substantive degree , but concentrates on oil and gas issues in isolation , and as such , its value is limited , " said a spokesman at the company 's headquarters in @entity106 , @entity107 , who asked not to be identified per company policy			2
" this report brings no new insights or analysis to help oil companies such as @entity122 improve managing the issues of the @entity11 , " the @entity9 spokesman said			2
" instead , in parts it draws wide - ranging and superficial conclusions from a number of these deeply complex issues , offering little underlying analysis to support those conclusions			0
" @entity122 is the @entity122 , the national oil and gas company in @entity2			2
@entity9 owns a 30 - percent stake in the company while the @entity2 government owns 55 percent			2
the @entity11 is a region in @entity2 consisting of nine oil - producing states			1
it has a land area of about 46,500 square miles ( 75,000 square km ) -- about the same size as the @entity137 or the @entity139 state of @entity140 , according to the @entity141 ( @entity141 )			0
an area of rich biological diversity , the region contains the world 's third - largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest , according to the @entity141			2
more than half the area contains creeks and small islands , while the rest is rainforest , the @entity141 says			0
at the same time , the @entity11 produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of @entity2 's foreign earnings , the @entity141 says			1
@entity6 says the majority of people living in the @entity11 depend on the natural environment for their food and livelihood , particularly through agriculture and fisheries			1
@entity9 said it is not responsible for some 80 percent of the pollution in the oil - rich area , because that pollution is the result of attacks and sabotage of @entity9 operations in the @entity11			1
" over the past four weeks alone we had eight attacks , " he said			0
" these attacks had a substantial impact on the environment , and assets , and most importantly for the people that live and work there			0
" about 85 percent of the oil spills from @entity9 operations are the result of attacks and sabotage , he said			0
@entity2 's main militant group , the @entity184 of the @entity11 , or @entity185 , has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on the region 's oil infrastructure in recent months			1
@entity185 said sunday it had attacked an offshore facility and that it was engulfed in flames			0
last week , the group said it had destroyed a pipeline owned and operated by the @entity195 gas company @entity194			0
also last week , @entity185 claimed to have destroyed @entity9 's main trunk line in @entity197 and a @entity199 oil station in the region			2
@entity185 demands that more of @entity2 's oil wealth be invested in the @entity11 instead of enriching those whom the militants consider to be corrupt politicians			1
last year , a series of @entity185 attacks forced @entity2 to cut its oil exports by as much as 40 percent			2
@entity6 's report acknowledged that armed groups and communities have worsened the pollution problem by vandalizing oil infrastructure or stealing oil , but it said the scale of the problem is not clear			1
@entity9 said plans are under way to deal with the problem of gas flaring , which happens when crude oil is brought to the surface along with the large volumes of gas that have been trapped with it			0
the gas used to be burned off safely in a process called flaring , but that process is now considered a waste of resources and revenue for the government , @entity9 says			0
a $ 3 billion program to reduce the gas flares has already been able to cut them by 30 percent , the company said			0
the @entity6 report also pointed the finger at governments and said they have failed to be held accountable for the situation of the people			0
the @entity11 covers 185 different local government areas , according to the @entity141			0
" the government must address the human impact of oil industry pollution , " said @entity49 , of @entity6			1
" they have a duty to protect their citizens from human rights abuse or harm by businesses and they are failing in that duty			2
" @entity9 supports " collaborative solutions " between communities , governments , corporations and non-profit groups as the only way to address the problems listed in the @entity6 report , the spokesman said			0
" the @entity122 definitely shares @entity6 's concern that the people in the @entity11 have n't benefited from the extraction of the oil and gas as they should , " the spokesman said , " but this has been the opinion of the @entity122 for a number of years			1
" @entity0 's @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
