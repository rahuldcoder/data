@entity0 is in the midst of a passionate debate about our constitutional development			1
it 's a debate we must have			1
but it 's a debate that must be tempered with reason			1
raw emotion -- for or against the proposed political reform -- will get us nowhere			0
it must also be a discussion based on the constitutional framework that provides for a @entity0 ( @entity0 ) within @entity13			1
much discussion has centered around the recent decision of the @entity16 of the @entity17 ( @entity18 ) of @entity13 on the parameters for electing the chief executive ( @entity21 ) by one - person , one - vote in 2017			2
critics say the nominating framework is too restrictive and that only candidates favored by @entity27 will eventually appear on the ballot			1
such claims are unfounded as we have not even started to discuss the detailed but crucial aspects of the nominating process for potential chief executive candidates			1
this will be the subject of a public consultation to be launched soon and which will eventually lead to the enabling legislation on changes to the electoral method for the 2017 election			0
election method on the question of electing the chief executive , the @entity42 , @entity0 's " mini-constitution , " provides that " the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures			1
" to change over to this new election method , the @entity42 requires the endorsement of a two - thirds majority of all ( currently 70 ) members of the @entity58 , the consent of the @entity21 , and be reported to the @entity18 of @entity13 for approval			1
basically , we have two choices : retain the current system by which the ce is elected by a 1,200 - person election committee ; or , adopt an enhanced system , the one recently announced by the @entity18 , that will see two to three candidates in a full - fledged election at which @entity0 's five million eligible voters will exercise this right for the first time			1
historic step i sincerely hope that legislators will take the historic step forward to achieve universal suffrage for the election in 2017 as scheduled			0
so far the debate has focused on the system per se			0
but the chief executive 's unique constitutional position within @entity13 also needs to be understood more clearly in order to fully appreciate the basis for the electoral process			2
unlike other cities or provinces in @entity13 , or for that matter , those in other countries , the @entity0 enjoys a far higher degree of autonomy in many areas including our legal system , legislature , internal security , immigration , customs , economy , finances , trade , industry , commerce , shipping , aviation , education , sport , religion and external affairs			2
all these are enshrined in our @entity42			0
these additional powers are devolved from the @entity109			0
this is why the central government has the power to appoint the chief executive as well as principal officials			0
this is also why the central government has a constitutional role in approving any changes to the electoral method for the chief executive			0
@entity0 is society with a deep respect for the rule of law			2
it is the pillar of our success			0
our common law system and an independent judiciary are protected by the @entity42 which i , as the chief executive , have pledged to uphold and protect			0
it is my fundamental and constitutional duty to work towards the goal of electing the chief executive by universal suffrage within that legal framework .			2
