she is 2 years old			1
@entity5 is just learning the basics of reading and writing , but she 's a veteran of technology			1
she 's been using an @entity8 since she was 1 , says her father , @entity9 , the founder and ceo of marketing agency @entity11			2
it 's fun for her , he says			2
it 's also a window into how she 'll communicate : with apps and texts and instant images and video			1
" she is part of a generation that will know nothing else but 140 characters and 16 seconds of video , " @entity9 said			2
" she is part of a generation that will never know what a commercial is , because she consumes everything on demand			2
she wants content when she wants it , and without any interruptions			2
and it better be bite - size , because that is really all she has time for -- and all her brain processes			2
" this is not a lament , he hastens to add			2
@entity9 says he draws his greatest lessons in technology usage from @entity5			2
in fact , he thinks @entity5 and her friends will be better at making sense of those tweets and video snippets than , well , us			1
" her generation will be much more efficient communicating and grasping information , " he said			2
" i am certain that she will read between the lines and grasp every nuance , because she has not had to relearn how to communicate or digest information			1
this is the only way she knows			2
but where does that leave the rest of us ? the blur of communications has progressed from letters and e-mails to texts , tweets and @entity64 pictures			1
@entity65 , detailed speeches have turned into clips , then sound bites , then @entity70 , @entity71 and animated @entity69			1
yes , we 're adjusting to an image - intensive , brevity - favoring world , a world as close and available as our smartphone			1
it 's a fast - growing , hugely popular world that rewards short attention spans			1
@entity64 was born in 2010 ; as of june , it has 130 million monthly active users and 45 million photos posted per day			1
@entity81 , the six - second video app introduced by the @entity84 folks in january , became the @entity87 app store 's most popular free download within three months			2
it had 13 million users as of june , and its most active users post more than 14 vines per day			2
not to be outdone , @entity64 launched its own short - video feature in june			1
users of @entity71 , a messaging platform popular with teens , exchange 200 million pictures a day			1
president @entity98 's campaign used a @entity84 photo to express thanks after his 2012 re-election ; it became the most popular tweet in @entity84 's history			2
@entity104 sends out photobombing pictures of his " troll foot " at every opportunity			2
creative types have used @entity81 and @entity64 to create memes , jokes and art. all this gives new meaning to the internet rule , " pics or it did n't happen			1
" ' all about the visuals ' that 's certainly the case with @entity119 , the 25 - year - old vice president of @entity120 , an @entity121 - based video production company			1
@entity119 only got turned on to @entity64 eight months ago , he says , but has been so won over by the app he 's practically given up texting or posting written messages to @entity124			1
the benefits are many , he says : more attention from the public , more convenience for him , more engagement in general			2
" it 's all about the visuals , " he said			1
" we could post a ( text ) saying we 're on the set with @entity135 or we could post a picture with @entity135 , and that was getting a lot more views			1
people like to be able to see the proof behind the text			1
it 's a much more honest way to engage for the audience			2
" he says the company 's success has been driven by its @entity64 push , estimating that 20 % of @entity120 's clientele has come through the service			1
@entity151 , a 19 - year - old student at @entity152 , is a fan of @entity81			2
for him and his friends , @entity81 and @entity71 " are bigger than @entity64			1
" @entity124 does n't even enter into the conversation , he says			2
( @entity155 , call your office			2
) the @entity81 videos are an easy way to share humor , he says			0
" humor , kind of expressing frustration , " he said			0
" it 's rare to have an informative @entity81 out there			0
" @entity64 , he says with impish disdain , " is more for people who want to express themselves and let people know that they 're expressing themselves			1
" all these services are known for their brevity and convenience			1
@entity171 , a @entity172 professor whose work crosses the disciplines of psychology , neuroscience and philosophy , likes those details : one of the great benefits of social media , he points out , is the creativity that brevity inspires			1
" it encourages people to distill ideas down to their core , and then only the ones that really stick get shared			1
so it is an effective way of generating incisive commentary , " he said			0
but he wonders whether something is being lost			0
it takes more than brief bursts of creativity to actually , well , communicate -- to really understand someone else 's perspective			1
" understanding others ' experience lies at the core of true moral understanding			1
it connects us to others and gives us a real appreciation of their motives and beliefs , " he said			0
" so the danger is that social media is making us fall back on what we already understand : our stereotypes and preconceived notions			0
when social communication is so accessible and immediate , it can also become very shallow			0
" remapping the brain that 's been a concern of older generations for , well , generations			0
when the telephone started becoming popular in the late 19th century , adults worried that youngsters were using it for flirtation			0
@entity226 was derided as the " boob tube , " and high - minded academics wondered why the promise of education and social uplift had been replaced by " mr. @entity233 " reruns			0
now we have these remarkable smartphones , devices with amazing computing and imaging power , and we use them for ... taking pictures of ourselves			0
@entity240 , a professor in @entity241 , routinely sees it among her students			1
with the way these photos spread on social media , she looks at it as " sort of an interesting attempt at fame , almost			0
it 's sort of being their own paparazzi			0
they put out these pictures of themselves , and they hope they get pushed on			0
" she finds it striking that @entity71 and @entity64 express two different attitudes toward social fame			1
@entity71 , after all , assumes that your image will be quickly wiped			0
@entity64 , however , is presumably forever : " it 's almost like a photo album , " @entity240 said			1
some observers worry that photos may not provide the same nuance as text			1
but dr. @entity267 , a neurosurgeon and the creator of @entity269 , a medical data communication service , notes that the brain is tremendously flexible			1
it 's just a matter of how much effort we put into assessing all that information flying at us , he says			0
the nuances we pick up through text we can also learn visually , though it takes time			1
think of muscle memory , he says : with enough repetition , the brain can create new pathways for physical tasks			0
the same is true in going from one medium to another			0
" it 's plasticity , " he said			0
and it does take time			0
but it takes an effort to go from the @entity293 to an @entity294			0
" but for those willing to make the effort , the brain can adjust			0
" from a neuroscience perspective , the brain is such an underestimated storehouse and synthesis house when it comes to information , " he said			0
full circle ? another grumble is that we 're leaving text behind completely and that coming generations will be worse off for it			1
however , @entity311 , a therapist and executive with @entity313 , says that 's just generational moralizing			0
" when i sit down with a bunch of therapists and ask what 's going on , they ca n't help but tell me about worried they are about young people , how young people are going to lose their communications skills , they 're going to be unempathetic towards other people , they 're going to be narcissistic ... all of this negativity , " said @entity311 , whose forthcoming book , " closer together , further apart , " is about the effect of technology on intimacy and relationships			1
" i think this is generational			0
this is just like sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll , when our parents were horrified			0
" instead , he says , it 's simply another turn -- one in which we do n't know the results yet			0
besides , it 's an evolution that 's been going on for , well , generations			0
in @entity348 's day , the " @entity350 " and " @entity349 " were presented orally			0
then we transitioned to the printed word			0
books eventually gave way to radio -- another version of the oral tradition -- and then television			0
when the @entity359 appeared , it was back to text			1
now , @entity361 points out , text is giving way to images again -- but that does n't mean the other forms of communication will go away			1
they 're all just tools , she says			0
" i do n't foresee ( image services ) meaning that we wo n't text anymore			1
it think it 's going to be more of a balancing act between them , " she said			0
in the future , who knows ? we could be communicating by @entity379 's connected @entity378 eyewear or by using our tech - embedded clothing			0
by then , it will be truly be @entity4 's world			0
" how she gets that information she likes has completely evolved from the way you and i grew up getting it , " her father said			0
" what we 're doing now is unthinkable 20 years ago			0

messaging has progressed from e-mails to texts , tweets , @entity70 and @entity64 pics
young people , especially , communicate through visuals and short bits of text
professor : brevity " encourages people to distill ideas down to their core "
neurosurgeon : " the nuances we pick up through text we can also learn visually "
