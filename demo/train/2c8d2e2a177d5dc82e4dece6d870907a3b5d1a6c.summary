@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's cold and raining in @entity0 and the pothole - filled dirt roads have turned into a sea of mud			1
we drive up to the gateway of a high - walled compound			0
a soldier brandishing an @entity12 stands guard outside the building			0
we 've come to a women 's shelter to meet @entity16 -- a 17 - year - old girl from @entity18 who should n't be alive			1
my crew and i are ushered into a room and sitting on a wooden chair slouched over is small , fragile @entity16			1
her sullen eyes turn from the raindrops streaming down the window outside and towards us as we enter the room			0
@entity16 's bright coloured headscarf is embroidered with blue , red and green flowers and covers most of her face			1
she nervously plays with it and gives us a glimpse of a frightened smile from underneath the fabric			0
her guardian @entity39 , from the shelter run by @entity41 , touches her head and gently moves the headscarf back			0
that 's when we see the scars etched deeply into her face			2
this @entity18 girl 's life of misery and suffering began at the tender age of 12 , when instead of going to school she was married to a man old enough to be her grandfather			1
she says : " my family married me off when i was 12 years old			0
every day he would beat me			0
i would cry and beg him stop			0
but he just kept on beating me			0
" when @entity16 told her family what was happening , they responded in a way that shocked her			1
" my family would hit me when i complained			0
they told me you belong in your husband 's house -- that is your life			1
" after five years of abuse , @entity16 met a young @entity1 man and finally gathered the courage to leave her husband in @entity18			1
in november 2012 she packed up some belongings and they made their way across the border into @entity1 to the city of @entity75			1

" i 'd tried to kill myself with poison several times but it did n't work			0
i hated my life and i had to escape			0
when i ran away i knew it would be dangerous			2
i knew my husband and family would be looking for me but i never thought this would happen			2
i thought my future would be bright , " she says			0
days later her older brother tracked them down			2
armed with an ax , he hacked to death @entity16 's friend , and then struck his own sister 15 times -- cutting open her face , head and parts of her body			1
@entity16 shows me these scars -- taking off her headscarf , her finger gently running up and down the raised , freshly healed skin			2
she touches her head where the blade hit her and then shows me the deep cuts that were made to the back of her neck and her arms			0
it 's clear to me she desperately tried to fight off her brother before she passed out			2
assuming she was dead , her brother escaped back to @entity18			1
authorities are yet to catch him , but his family denies that he tried to kill @entity16			2
hearing the commotion , a passer - by discovered @entity16 lying in a pool of blood in her bed , and rushed her to the @entity127 of @entity128			2
with part of her brain hanging out of her skull , neurosurgeon @entity129 held out little hope that the girl on his operating table would survive			0

her injuries were horrific and her brain had been affected -- we did n't think she would survive " , says @entity144 as he shows us photos of @entity16 's injuries before he sewed up the wounds			1
in one photo her face looks like a piece of meat that has been hacked apart			0
@entity144 said : " we are very thankful to almighty @entity154 that @entity16 is alive -- it really is a miracle			2
" but @entity16 's troubles were far from over			1
while she 'd received life - saving treatment from the doctors and staff at the hospital , she had no one to care for her on the outside			0
@entity16 had been disowned by her family and despite the government and authorities knowing that she was alive and receiving care at the hospital , they wanted nothing to do with her due to the stigma and circumstances surrounding her attack			2
for two months @entity16 stayed in the hospital thanks to the generosity of doctors who donated the money to pay for her medicine			2
finally the @entity137 - @entity1 organization @entity41 was informed of @entity16 's situation and took her in , transporting her back to a shelter in @entity0 to give her the love and care she so desperately needed			1
" when she first came to us she could n't talk or walk she was barely conscious -- she could n't eat by herself			0
she had to wear a diaper			0
if we had n't got her when we did , she would n't have survived , " says @entity191 , the executive director of @entity41			0
@entity16 is one of thousands of women living in shelters across @entity1 -- many of them victims of attempted honor killings			1
tragically this practice still exists in a number of cultures , including certain tribes in @entity1 and @entity18			1
@entity203 secretary general @entity202 recently expressed concern over the 20 % increase in civilian casualties among women and girls in @entity1 in 2012			1
@entity202 said : " i 'm deeply disturbed that despite some improvements in prosecuting cases of violence , there is still a pervasive climate of impunity in @entity1 for abuses of women and girls			1
" read more : @entity203 : civilian deaths fall in @entity1 ; first drop in 6 years the @entity203 claims that 4,000 cases of violence against women and girls were reported to the @entity1 ministry of women between 2010 and 2012			1
while there are 14 women 's shelters in @entity1 , all of them are funded by the international community , and the concern is that once international forces pull out of @entity1 at the end of 2014 this funding will disappear			1
what will that mean for the thousands of women who rely on their services like uneducated , illiterate , homeless @entity16 ? @entity191 says : " if we send her to her family , she 's going to be killed			1
as far as her family is concerned she 's dead			0
that 's the problem for all our women			2
it 's a scary time for @entity1 and especially for @entity1 women , in particular the women in our shelters because we do n't know what 's going to happen			1
if they leave here , for most of them it will be a death sentence			0
" @entity16 does n't think about the future -- and in fact , she wishes she had died the day she was attacked			2
" i 've tried to kill myself several times since arriving at the shelter but they wo n't let me			0
when i look at the mirror i put one hand to the side of my face			0
people tell me not to do that ... but i 'm so ashamed			0
