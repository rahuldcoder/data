@entity0 -- the government is warning that taking the psoriasis drug @entity3 could result in serious brain infection and even death			1
@entity3 may cause a serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy			2
the @entity9 cited three confirmed cases , and a possible fourth , of people diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( @entity13 ) after being treated with @entity3			2
" three of those patients have died , " the @entity9 said in a public health advisory			0
" all four patients were treated with the drug for more than three years			0
" none was receiving other treatments that suppress the immune system			1
@entity3 's product labeling was revised in october to highlight a boxed warning about the risks of life - threatening infections , including @entity13			1
