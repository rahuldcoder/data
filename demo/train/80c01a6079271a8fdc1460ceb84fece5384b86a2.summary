@entity14 , co-authors say there 's strong evidence a lower drinking age would cause deaths and injuries			1
( @entity20 ) -- the national policy that set a minimum legal drinking age of 21 is being questioned by a group of 135 college and university presidents through an effort called the @entity27			1
in a september 16 commentary on @entity20 , @entity27 leader @entity29 , a former president of @entity30 , proposes lowering the drinking age , which he suggests will lead to less drinking and related problems among college students			1
history and a comprehensive review of the research tell a much different story			0
the evidence is clear , consistent and compelling : a drinking age of 21 has led to less drinking , fewer injuries and fewer deaths			1
in the 1970s when many states reduced their drinking ages , drinking - related deaths among young people increased			0
when the drinking age of 21 was restored , deaths declined			1
this effect is not simply a historical artifact explained by advances in safety technology and other policies			0
@entity55 recently lowered the drinking age based on many of the same arguments advanced by the @entity27			1
the result was more alcohol - involved traffic crashes and emergency room visits among 15 - to 19 - year - olds			1
@entity55 is now considering raising its drinking age			1
the @entity65 estimates that setting the drinking age at 21 saves the lives of 900 young people each year and has saved more than 25,000 lives since 1975			1
it was on the basis of compelling research evidence about its lifesaving benefits that a bipartisan effort created @entity75 98 - 363 , " @entity76 " in the first place			2
subsequent research has strengthened the evidence			0
college students who are underage , for example , binge drink less than students aged 21 - 23			1
underage students who attend colleges that rigorously enforce the drinking age , and who reside in states that have more laws restricting access to alcohol for those under the legal age , are less likely to binge drink			1
another myth promulgated by the @entity27 is that @entity97 young people are taught by families to drink responsibly because of the typically lower legal drinking ages there			0
the reverse is the case			0
surveys of youth in multiple @entity97 countries show that rates of frequent binge drinking among adolescents are higher in @entity97 than in the @entity109			1
panels of experts , convened separately by the @entity112 , the @entity113 , the @entity114 and the @entity115 have studied the evidence on the age - 21 law and concluded that it is effective public policy			1
rather than lowering the drinking age , they recommended bolstering the law by closing loopholes in state law and strengthening enforcement			1
there is a silver lining to the call for reopening discussion on the minimum legal drinking age			1
while some college presidents have signed on to the @entity27 , most have not			2
college presidents acknowledge that a serious problem exists on their campuses and that something needs to be done			2
working effectively with their communities and states to address student drinking is the place to start , not with a discussion about lowering the drinking age			1
college presidents must show leadership by promoting solutions recommended by a report from the @entity146 released in 2002			2
these recommendations for college and community leaders included creating systems for reaching individual students with effective interventions , implementing , publicizing and enforcing laws to prevent alcohol - impaired driving and underage drinking , restrictions on alcohol retail outlets , increasing prices and excise taxes on alcoholic beverages , and responsible beverage service policies at on - and off - campus venues			2
few colleges and their communities have even begun the steps needed to enact these efforts			2
these recommendations will be difficult to implement and significant barriers exist , including resistance from the industries that profit from selling alcohol			0
college presidents can not accomplish this alone			2
they need the support of students , regents , parents , alumni and their communities			0
state and local legislators need to pass tougher restrictions and provide resources for enforcement			0
lobbying legislators to dismantle the effective drinking age law is a step in the wrong direction			2
so rather than try the approaches advocated by the @entity27 that have no foundation in research , let 's be clear about the issues			0
college student drinking is a serious problem			0
each year more young people are injured , sexually assaulted and die as the result of drinking			0
these statistics would be even worse without the age - 21 law			0
lowering the drinking age will not save lives or make our campuses and communities better places to live			1
it will increase heavy drinking and the problems that accompany it in college communities and push the problem back into high schools			0
real prevention requires constant vigilance , dedication and the courage to implement difficult solutions			0
