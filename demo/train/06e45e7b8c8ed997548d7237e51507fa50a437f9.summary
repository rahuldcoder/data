-- today 's soccer professionals have a battery of physios , fitness trainers and doctors all striving to fine - tune their players ' physique for optimum performance			1
but are football clubs missing a trick in overlooking dedicated training for the most important organ of all -- the brain ? scientists at @entity16 's @entity15 believe the game 's top talents , such as @entity20 's @entity19 and @entity22 's @entity21 , have mental faculties that are better programmed to anticipate their opponents ' moves			1
research published in the @entity27 found that of 39 players tested , the more experienced footballers were able to suppress the urge to act instinctively , making them less susceptible to feints or tricks from their opponents			1
@entity35 's study reinforces the view held by one of the greatest players of all time -- @entity40 , who said that football is a game you play with your brain -- and offers tantalizing prospects for clubs			1
neural activity should they be able to unpick the best way to condition the brain 's ability to anticipate an opponent 's trickery , it could lead to better players and a potential stampede as clubs rush to add a neuroscientist to their back - room teams			1
" i can see top teams employing neuroscientists in the future , " dr. @entity61 from @entity35 's @entity62 and @entity63 told @entity0			0
" that 's because we have the skills and resources to witness very subtle changes in perceptual abilities that may not initially manifest in performance data , because people can change their mind midway through a task and therefore give an erroneous response , when in fact their initial ' preattentive ' brain response was the correct one			2
" i imagine that this will be most useful at academy level , to assess the development of young players			2
" @entity61 believes the findings could help nurture a new generation of young sports stars in @entity88 , which is seeking to capitalize on a potential increase in participation following the @entity92			2
" we believe this greater level of neural activity is something that can be developed through high - quality training , so the next step will be to look at how the brain can be trained over time to anticipate the moves of opponents , " he said			1
" particularly following on from the @entity101 , with more people being encouraged to take up sport , we hope that our findings can be used to refine and speed up training techniques to nurture the potential in budding young sports stars			0
" during the trial , players ranging from novices to semiprofessionals were placed in an mri scanner and shown video clips of a player dribbling towards them			0
they then had to decide in which direction to move in order to tackle them			0
the study found the better players were more sensitive to moves and tricks by an opponent than those at the less talented end of the scale , which came as no surprise to @entity61			2
" i am confident the findings would be even stronger with professional players , " he said			0
" much of the activation we saw was comparable to the activations we had witnessed in our previous studies of badminton players -- which included a large number of international athletes			0
" neurological track there is growing group of coaches who need no convincing of the power of the brain in developing top players			2
one of them is @entity147 , technical director at @entity148 -- a company that specializes in elite performance coaching			0
" i think that coaches either forget , or do n't even realize , that football is a hugely cognitive sport , " he said in an interview with football magazine @entity152			0
" we 've got to develop the players ' brains as well as their bodies but it 's much easier to see and measure the differences we make to a player 's physiology than we can with their cognitive attributes			1
" his views are shared by @entity166 , formerly academy director for @entity168 club @entity167 and now at @entity170 's @entity169 , who is something of a pioneer when it comes to brain training in soccer players			1
he places huge value on " brain - centered learning " and devised a specific program designed to foster improvement in a young player 's cognitive skills			1
@entity166 places the same level of importance of neuroscience as he does football tactics			0
both @entity166 and @entity147 have embraced " overload " drills to help tune players ' brains , where some might be asked to speak in different languages during fitness training while others are asked to toss a tennis ball around and call out colors during sessions involving the football			1
" we need to develop an engram -- a neurological track -- in the brain , " @entity166 told @entity152			0
" we always thought that sporting activities were mechanical activities , but we know that there are interventions from the brain			0
" @entity166 's work has been acknowledged by one of the world 's top soccer coaches , @entity207 , the current manager at @entity22 who has won titles in four different countries and lifted the @entity212 twice			1
" @entity207 immediately understood what i 'm trying to do and he asked a lot of intelligent questions , " said @entity166			2
" he also noticed that the organization of the drills requires a greater team involvement , more concentration , attention , a continuous inciting of perception and that intelligent playing could grow a lot			0

@entity88 *university* finds better players have ability to suppress urge to act instinctively
study *suggests* better brain training in younger players could aid their development
coach @entity207 has *investigated* methods of brain - centered learning
