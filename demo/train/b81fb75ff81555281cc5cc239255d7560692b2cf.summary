charges against a @entity2 woman accused of helping her 93 - year - old father to commit suicide have reignited the national debate over aid - in - dying laws			1
a @entity8 magistrate has ordered @entity9 , 57 , of @entity10 to stand trial for allegedly handing her terminally ill father his prescription morphine medication , which prosecutors claim caused or assisted his suicide			1
at the august 1 preliminary hearing , magistrate @entity17 said that prosecutors had presented enough evidence for the assisted suicide charges against @entity9 , a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison			1
a county judge issued a gag order in the case before the preliminary hearing began			0
" i ca n't respond			0
i 'm sorry , " @entity9 told reporters as she left court in @entity10			1
according to @entity9 's lawyer , who spoke to reporters via teleconference the day before the hearing , her father , @entity30 , was in " unremitting " pain , suffering from numerous medical conditions including diabetes and kidney failure			1
his daughter , who is also a nurse , was at his home hospice bedside when he allegedly asked her to pass him his prescribed morphine			1
" he chose to drink his morphine because that was the only way for him to find pain relief			2
that was his choice ; that was his constitutional right to do that , " attorney @entity45 said			0
@entity9 's " stated intention , only intention " was to help her father get relief from his pain , he said			1
according to the medical records noted in his autopsy report , @entity30 went into a coma not long after taking the morphine and was found unresponsive by @entity58 , a nurse with @entity59			1
@entity58 called an ambulance and called the 911 and reported an attempted suicide			0
@entity63 capt. @entity62 said in an affidavit that when he responded to the call on february 7 , @entity9 opened the door			1
" she told me that her father had asked her for his morphine so he could commit suicide , and she provided it			2
she further stated that he was on hospice care , was already dying and did not want to be taken to hospital , " he said @entity30 , who according to @entity45 had a do - not - resuscitate order and had expressed his wishes to die at home , was then taken to a hospital and revived			1
@entity9 was arrested and charged			1
@entity76 told reporters that when @entity30 awoke in the hospital , he was angry			0
" he starts raising hell with everybody for @entity81 , why are you doing this to me and number two , when he sees the police there , he wants to know why are they here and what are you saying my daughter did , leave her alone ! " @entity30 died in the hospital four days later from complications due to morphine toxicity , according to the autopsy report			1
@entity98 , an end - of - life choice advocacy group that has been fighting for dignity - in - death laws for over 30 years , is petitioning @entity2 attorney general @entity101 to have the charges dropped			1
" there 's no question the she acted out of compassion and love and support for her 93 - year - old dying dad			0
the fact that she 's being charged is outrageous , " said @entity109 , the group 's president			2
" dying patients have a federal constitutional right to as much medicine as they need to relieve their pain , even if it advances their time of death			0
" while most states ban assisted suicide , aid - in - dying is permitted in @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			0
@entity126 will review a death - with - dignity bill later this fall that would allow aid - in - dying			0
medical ethicist @entity129 supports doctor - assisted suicide with restrictions , not family assisted suicide			0
he said @entity9 's case has all the signs of a mercy killing			2
" your heart goes out to the family but at the same time , you 're trying to make sure that it does n't quickly turn into ' we 're encouraging you to do this ' or ' why do n't you do this ? life would be simpler for us if you swallowed a bunch of morphine			0
' it has to be regulated			0
" @entity129 does not expect @entity9 to serve jail time			2
@entity151 agrees that it 's important to screen cases and make sure there 's no malice or self - interest involved , but " when all the evidence and the entire family 's testimony says it was not , it should end there			0
" she said the case has national implications because it scares doctors and hospice workers into not giving elderly patients needed pain medicine and instead encourages them to " save themselves , not the patient " and protect themselves against legal proceedings			0
@entity9 is out on bail and is expected to be arraigned this fall and stand trial early next year .			2
