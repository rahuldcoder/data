" saddened and disgusted by the footage from a slaughterhouse , the @entity6 girl announced she was no longer going to eat meat			2
her parents were less than thrilled			1
" when she first said she wanted to be a vegetarian , we were just looking at each other and we said , ' we ca n't be switching meals for you			1
you are not going to get your protein			2
' we were not educated in the health benefits , " said @entity17 's mother , @entity16			1
while many parents worry whether their vegetarian or vegan children will receive adequate nutrition for their growing bodies , the @entity19 says such diets , as long as they are well - planned , are appropriate for all phases of life , including childhood and adolescence			1

eating a variety of vegetables and fruits of all colors and eating the purest form possible is vital in these diets , @entity99 said			1
beans , legumes , nuts , tofu and seeds all are excellent protein sources , said @entity99 , who said veganism and vegetarianism are becoming more mainstream among young people			2
" i think the reason why veganism is getting more and more popular is there are more celebrities like president @entity123 , " embracing the lifestyle , said @entity99 , editorial director of the department 's nutrition website , @entity118			1

@entity1 and her family have done copious research about their lifestyles , becoming educated about meeting their nutritional needs through an array of fresh foods			2
such vigilance and education is vital , experts said , because adolescence is characterized by the second and final period of rapid growth and development			0
those growing bodies need nutrients , including calcium , vitamin d , @entity182 and iron			0
teens or children who are vegetarian and who then also decide to give up dairy products need to find an alternate source of calcium , @entity71 said			1

vitamin and mineral supplements also provide a way to get adequate iron and other essential nutrients , she said			1
" clearly , there are some big benefits of a plant - based diet , so i 'm not objecting to that			1
i think the more restrictive the diet becomes , the more exclusive the diet becomes , the harder it becomes for the average person to execute those diet changes , " she said			0
