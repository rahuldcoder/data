he made his pick in style , staging a news conference in the gym of @entity19 and delivering the big announcement before teachers and members of the media			2
a visit to the @entity25 , @entity26 , campus helped him decide			2
" my @entity28 experience last week was incredible , " he said			2
" i met geniuses from all across the world			2
and everyone there was so friendly and inviting			1
... and i believe that their deep appreciation and love for music , like i have , was very critical for me deciding to go there			2
" his father , @entity38 , thanked all those at the high school who encouraged his son			2
" we are grateful for all the inspiration , " he said			2
" people think @entity3 is like an angel or somebody who was sheltered			1
really , we gave him a lot of freedom , even though at the same time we were very strict with him in terms of academics and the way he behaved			0
... we only pray that going forward he will stay focused and not be distracted			0
" referring to @entity3 's 14 - year - old sister , @entity57 , their father said : " i told her , look , i believe you can do better than him			1
" @entity3 scored 2250 out of a possible 2400 on his sat , placing him in the 98th percentile across the country , according to @entity64			1
he 's also ranked 11th in his class at @entity19 , a public school on @entity66 , according to his principal , @entity67			0
" i applied knowing that going to any of the @entity6 schools would be wonderful , " @entity3 told @entity68 earlier this month			1
" i thought if i applied to all eight , i figured i 'd get into one ... but from the first one onwards i said , ' this ca n't be happening ! ' i was shocked seeing all these acceptances under my name			0
" @entity67 said @entity3 is not only a model academic student , but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra , sings in an a cappella group , throws shot put and discus for the high school 's track and field team , participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade			1
" usually kids are good athletes or good musicians or good actors , but they do n't have all three and then on top add student government			0
it 's a balancing act			0
he somehow finds time to do it all and then volunteer at a local hospital , " @entity67 said			0
@entity67 has been @entity3 's principal for six years in both middle and high school			1
" he is an incredibly modest , humble and respectable person , " @entity67 said			0

he takes advantage of whatever opportunity he is afforded			0
" @entity98 , the founder of @entity99 in @entity100 , who also previously served on admissions committees at selective universities , said the feat is extremely rare			0
" it 's quite atypical , " @entity104 said , adding that most students do not apply to all the @entity6 schools			1
" standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read , " @entity104 said			0
" but it 's their extracurricular activities , leadership experience , exceptional talents , recommendation letters and personal essays that will move a student from a pile of ' maybes ' to a pile of ' accepted			1
' " @entity7 's acceptance rate , among the most selective in the country , was just 5.9 % for the applicants for the class of 2017 , according to its admissions site			0
@entity3 was also accepted to @entity129 and three @entity131 campuses			1
@entity3 admitted all along that he favored @entity1			1
" i really liked their sense of family , relationships between undergraduates and professors , and the residential college , " he said earlier this month			0
" they also have a strong biomedical engineering program , which is a wonderful combination of biology and creative tools that doctors and health care professionals can use			0
" @entity3 added that @entity1 also has a strong music program , one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he is n't hitting the books in college			1
he hopes to one day pursue medicine , a dream of his that just so happens to align with his parents ' careers			0
his parents , who immigrated from @entity157 in the late 1980s , are both nurses and pushed @entity3 to receive the highest grades possible and follow his dreams			1
" health care is a prominent field that satisfies people beyond finances and edifies people and is about moral development , " he said			1
his advice for future applicants ? " follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools , " he said			2
" develop your outside interests -- not just academics			0
