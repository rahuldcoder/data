-- after the past week 's political upheavals in @entity3 and around the country , we are reminded that certain things remain constant in politics			1
unfortunately , one of those things is the sexism leveled at any woman who rises to power in the @entity11 -- under presidents of either party			0
no sooner was the hunt on for a fall guy for the @entity17 midterm losses than some in the press predictably went after a fall gal -- president @entity22 's senior adviser , @entity21			1
reporter @entity23 in @entity24 and others have decided that the best way to address @entity17 losses is to have a " shake - up " at the @entity11 , and the person they most want to see shaken out is @entity31			1
she is pilloried for everything from run - ins with other staffers to playing herself in a cameo role on @entity38 ' " @entity37			0
" that 's how much they object to the job @entity21 is doing -- they do n't even want her doing it in the fictional realm			1
the @entity24 story , headlined " fire @entity21 , even notes that " nobody knows precisely what @entity31 does in the @entity11			1
" but whatever it is , it 's wrong enough that she needs to be fired			2
withering criticism is something that is meted out regardless of gender in @entity3			1
attorney general @entity55 has been called every name in the book , including the ones that have to be spelled using asterisks			0
but @entity31 is being subjected to a refrain of snipes and swipes that sound like they were cribbed from the @entity65 feed of one of " @entity67			1
" the litany of @entity31 's run - ins with other @entity11 power brokers reads like a plot synopsis for a new " @entity73 " movie			1
even more telling are the descriptions of @entity31 that trivialize her position and the skills that got her to that position			1
the @entity24 article states , " if her role in this administration reflected reality , @entity31 would be called ' @entity84 ' to both @entity85 and @entity22			1
" " big sister ! " @entity88 may have been characterized as an evil genius , but he was never reduced to being called merely @entity91 's big brother figure			2
he was given credit for being good at what he did , not dismissed as a sycophantic surrogate sibling			0
but @entity23 fails even to acknowledge any of @entity31 's good works			1
senior administration officials have told me she played an important role in making sure that the uninsured , particularly uninsured women , were enrolled in the @entity101			0
more than 4.3 million women and girls enrolled in coverage during the first open enrollment period			0
as of june , 29.7 million women are estimated to have access to expanded preventive services coverage such as mammograms , @entity111 testing , contraception and other screenings with no cost - sharing			0
she spent months developing and executing a plan to bring community leaders and celebrities into the @entity101 rollout to reach uninsured people " where they are			2
" in another article , @entity123 is somewhat more generous to @entity31			1
@entity125 , a former @entity11 speechwriter in the @entity127 administration , says , " @entity31 is the @entity11 ' mirror , mirror on the wall ' who has cultivated the psychological dependency of the president of the @entity133			1
" according to him , @entity31 still attained her power through mere flattery , but at least she has a certain @entity139 villain sinister cachet			1
and as someone who psychologically controls the president , she 's more big brother than big sister			2
@entity21 is certainly not the first woman who achieved power in @entity3 to be treated so disrespectfully			1
the shards of the broken glass ceiling cut both @entity148 and @entity149			0
when @entity91 was president , the @entity151 ' @entity150 dismissed @entity91 female staffers @entity152 , @entity154 and @entity155 all as nothing more than " adoring work wives , catering to @entity159 's every political , legal and ego - affirming need			2
" evidently presidents of either party choose their male advisers based on their talents , and their female advisers based purely on their ability to serve up chicken soup for the soul			0
@entity150 said , " w. loves being surrounded by tough women who steadfastly devote their entire lives to doting on him			0
" one ca n't even read that statement without picturing @entity174 tousling @entity91 's hair			2
@entity150 was especially fond of the phrase " office wives , " which is the sort of thing that really should only be said by characters in the show " @entity182 , " and even then only the early seasons			0
at another point , @entity150 implies that @entity185 got her job as secretary of state by just spending time with @entity159 and " making him feel like the most thoughtful , farsighted he - man in the world			0
" in one sentence , a woman who had devoted her life to diplomacy and public service has been reduced to a cheerleader ... and a self - serving cheerleader at that			0
@entity199 has been attacked for being @entity199 for so long now that it 's easy to forget that the criticism of her began with the same sexist overtones now being used on @entity31			1
before hillary - bashing became its own thing , she was subjected to the standard - issue woman - bashing used on every powerful woman in @entity3			2
well , @entity209 got the royal treatment -- she was routinely compared to @entity211			0
a @entity151 piece from 1992 said that at least 20 articles in major publications that year had compared her to @entity216 's homicidal heroine with the stain problems			0
" out , damned spot ! " great -- even @entity216 's greatest villainess sounds like a laundry - obsessed housewife to modern ears			0
the only surprising thing about all of the comparisons of @entity209 to @entity211 is that so many @entity3 pundits are familiar with the classics			2
the @entity24 article calling for @entity31 's ouster ends up suggesting that maybe she can be transitioned out by making her the " @entity22 librarian " in charge of plans for the presidential library			1
really , librarian ? why not just give her another stereotypical female job ? she could become his secretary -- fielding phone calls and taking messages			0
or bookkeeper , balancing the checkbook			0
@entity11 nurse , or a stewardess on @entity244 ! women in @entity3 -- and in positions of power anywhere -- should be subjected to the same criticisms and held to the same standards as men			2
that does not include the assumption that any successful woman has attained her position through flattery , feminine wiles or her ability to provide maternal comfort to a more powerful man			0
we can criticize a person 's performance without demeaning her based on gender			1
after all , our most basic human flaws transcend gender -- so should our criticism of those flaws .			2

in wake of @entity17 *election* losses , some call for firing of @entity22 adviser @entity21
@entity274 : everyone gets attacked in @entity3 , but @entity31 is target of sexist criticism
she says @entity31 is being given the disrespectful treatment that @entity199 , others have seen
@entity274 : it 's ok to criticize but do n't demean people based on their gender
