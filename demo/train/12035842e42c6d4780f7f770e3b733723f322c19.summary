@entity0 , @entity1 -- pro-india groups sunday welcomed the latest initiative from @entity5 to defuse the crisis in @entity1 - administered @entity7 , but a hard - line separatist leader spearheading the unrelenting pro-independence unrest dismissed the plan as " an eyewash			1
" chief minister of @entity13 and @entity7 @entity12 was one of the first to hail the eight - point proposal , describing it as " a positive development which should lead to resolving the political issues of the state			1
" @entity12 said students who had been detained for throwing stones during the violent demonstrations that have so far claimed 106 lives would be released soon , and schools and colleges should reopen monday so that students will be prepared for annual state board exams			0
however , he said , one of the main points of the proposal -- to scale down the number of security forces in the area and to withdraw the @entity32 in some places -- would be reviewed this week at the unified headquarters meeting			1
the @entity1 government had imposed a strict round - the - clock curfew in the summer capital of @entity0 and in several other areas in an attempt to prevent angry mobs from taking to the street			1
still , residents -- many of whom favor an independent @entity46 nation in the @entity48 majority @entity49 , part of @entity1 's northern @entity13 state -- came out hurling stones at police and paramilitary troopers who have in turn , opened fire and used tear gas			0
@entity59 party chief @entity58 described the eight - point initiative , which was introduced saturday by home minister @entity61 , as " a good beginning			1
" the moderate @entity63 ( @entity64 ) chairman , @entity65 , expressed " disappointment " with the proposal			2
he said his group would issue its formal reaction monday after a meeting of its executive committee			0
the hard - line separatist leader @entity72 dismissed the initiative as " an eyewash , as it does n't address the fundamental issue of accepting @entity7 as an international dispute by @entity5			1
" it also does not take into account other demands of demilitarization under the auspices of a credible international agency and withdrawal of @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , he said			0
referring to the @entity1 home minister 's announcement regarding a plan for dialogue with all sectors of society , @entity72 said that by his count , more than " 150 rounds of talks have been held since 1947 between @entity46 and @entity5 which have , however , yielded nothing			1
" @entity7 analyst @entity96 noted that the proposal " has failed to enthuse the separatist leaders , who have been upping the ante for @entity7 's secession from @entity1			1
" also included in the plan is proposed compensation for the families of protest victims of the equivalent of about $ 11,000 each			1
since the latest wave of unrest began in june , 106 people have died			0
the @entity1 government says another 245 people were detained			0
earlier in the week , @entity61 , the home minister , led an all - party delegation of @entity1 parliamentarians to @entity0 to assess the situation firsthand			2
delegation members drove through the curfew - bound streets to an international conference center on the banks of @entity121 , once one of @entity1 's most popular tourist destinations			2
the delegation met with leaders of various @entity126 parties			2
@entity46 separatist leaders had turned down invitations for talks			2
@entity131 leaders @entity65 and @entity132 also turned down invitations to join the discussions , but sent a joint memorandum to the delegation reiterating their demands for restoration of normalcy and the initiation of dialogue			0
among those demands were demilitarization , the release of detainees and the withdrawal of what they called draconian laws			0
claims on the mostly @entity48 @entity49 has been a matter of dispute since the independence of @entity1 and @entity152 in 1947			0
@entity1 deployed thousands of troops in @entity7 to guard against what @entity1 leaders believe was a @entity152 - backed insurgency that began in late 1980s			1
that insurgency , which claimed tens of thousands of lives , has waned but the troops have remained , fueling new waves of separatist unrest .			0
