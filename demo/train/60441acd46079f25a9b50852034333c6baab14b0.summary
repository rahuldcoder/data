in the midst of the struggle against @entity3 's government stands @entity4 , recently designated by the @entity5 as a foreign terrorist organization			1
a new report by the @entity8 in @entity9 says the organization is the most effective arm of the @entity13 insurgency and now fields about 5,000 fighters against the @entity3 regime			1
practically speaking , the terrorist designation means little that is new for the immediate struggle in @entity13			1
shortly after @entity4 claimed credit for one of its early suicide bombings in january 2012 , the @entity23 administration made known @entity4 's connection to @entity28 in @entity29 , a group with which i was intimately familiar in my capacity as an analyst and targeting officer at the @entity33			1
the administration 's position was reinforced when director of national intelligence @entity36 one month later testified in front of the @entity39 that " ... we believe @entity28 in @entity29 is extending its reach into @entity13			1
" analysis : study shows rise of @entity28 affiliate in @entity13 @entity4 is filling a power vacuum through charitable efforts to galvanize local support and generating influence among @entity13			1
in light of @entity4 's influence in @entity13 , the real question is not so much about the scope and scale of @entity4 currently , but rather how should the @entity54 respond to its rise , particularly after @entity3 's eventual exit ? read more : @entity57 touts plan for resolution , says enemies of @entity13 ' will go to hell ' historically , the @entity54 government seemed to believe that as soon as people are given the chance , they will choose and then create a @entity66 democracy			1
then we are surprised , if not outraged , that people turn to organizations such as @entity69 , @entity70 or the @entity71 in electoral contests			0
these organizations often provide the basic necessities that people need to survive : food , water , medical care , education and security			0
as ideologically distasteful as we might find them , they are often doing things corrupt , weak or failing governments do not : providing the basic necessities that people need to survive ( let alone create the conditions that enable people to aspire to thrive )			0
why does @entity4 keep quiet about its ties to @entity28 in @entity29 ? the documents pulled from the @entity87 raid that killed @entity88 shed light on his awareness that the @entity28 brand had been deteriorating			2

@entity88 and @entity105 had criticized the @entity107 - born founder and leader of @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity109 , for his killing of civilians and lack of political acumen to win public support			2
talk about @entity28 seems distant			2
it was a bogeyman made real in 1993 when it unsuccessfully attacked the @entity117 and terrifyingly tangible in 2001 when its operatives succeeded in destroying the twin towers and expanded their attacks to the @entity121 and the air over @entity123			0
its looming shadow has since faded from the public eye , particularly with the death of @entity88			0
its vision and ideology , however , continue to have a strong appeal			0
now that @entity28 central has a less visible role , what makes players like @entity4 and @entity28 in @entity29 threats ? even today , after @entity109 's death , @entity28 in @entity29 has managed to continue to wreak havoc in @entity29 and in the region through an autonomous , adaptable structure			0
read more : senior @entity28 leader killed in @entity141 , officials say @entity4 has declared itself a player in the fight for a global jihad , a bold statement for what is today a localized group			1
even small groups , however , have the potential to disrupt regional stability and complicate @entity54 's pursuit of its national security objectives — a fact i learned firsthand tracking and trying to stem the rise , influence and efficacy of @entity28 in @entity29 in the aftermath of the @entity54 invasion of @entity29			1
@entity109 , until his death in 2006 , was able to confound @entity54 forces and attack @entity107 by attracting recruits from @entity164 ( including @entity165 ) , @entity166 , @entity107 and @entity13			1
some of @entity109 's earliest recruits were veterans of the @entity169 , an organization that lashed out against the @entity13 government during the 1980s			2
captured records from a raid near the city of @entity174 , @entity29 , indicated that during the 2006 - 2007 time frame , 8 % of @entity28 in @entity29 operatives were @entity13			1
the percentage likely ebbed and flowed as the group formed , became influential and waned , but it suggests that there was no shortage of recruits amenable to engage in religious conflict in @entity13 as recently as 5 - 10 years ago			2
read more : what is the @entity71 ? the most striking thing about the captured records , however , is that it appears almost every foreign fighter entering @entity29 to join @entity28 in @entity29 came through @entity13			1
as a targeter , i can tell you that facilitation networks are key : they are the means by which groups such as @entity28 in @entity29 are funded , supplied and sustained			2
during the @entity29 war , @entity109 's top aides in @entity13 played a critical role in recruiting , funding and operational planning outside @entity29			0
read more : @entity13 minister : enemies ' brainwashed ' slain rebel son one of the things @entity54 officials and the international media should watch for is how @entity4 uses its terrorist designation : if it seeks to use the declaration to burnish its jihadist credentials , it might be able to bolster the image of the organization in the eyes of the extremist community and parlay that recognition into larger , or steadier , streams of funding — a development that will make the group more viable over the long - term or allow it to expand its operations or influence in the short - to mid-term			1
an important differentiator between @entity28 in @entity29 and @entity4 is one of its tactics : @entity109 made a practice of indiscriminately killing @entity29 civilians , effectively terrorizing the @entity29 population , especially the @entity228 minority			0
@entity109 , despite identifying with @entity28 , had a much thinner theological basis than @entity28 central			0
key figures at @entity28 central such as @entity88 and @entity105 argued with @entity109 over his tactics , complaining that alienating mainstream @entity102 would not help achieve the over-arching goal of instilling @entity236 law			2
read more : @entity105 - fast facts @entity4 is using some of the same tactics as @entity28 in @entity29 ( e.g. , suicide bombings , kidnappings and car bombs ) , but it appears to be trying to strike a balance @entity109 was unwilling to make : not only does it seem to be avoiding alienating — if not antagonizing — the larger population , but it also is providing the people of @entity13 with a range of goods and services such as food , water and medical care — basic necessities that people need to survive in the best of times , let alone when their country is in the throes of a civil war			1
if this becomes a trend , it might signal that @entity4 aspires to be more like @entity70 or @entity69 , organizations that defy neat categorization based on the range of social , political and military activities they engage in and the resultant legitimacy they have in the eyes of their constituencies			0
read more : @entity69 leader unbending , but seeks @entity272 unity in the @entity13 uprising , the opportunity for meaningful @entity54 intervention might have passed : exhaustion from operations in @entity29 and @entity278 have taken their toll on the @entity54 military , have taxed the national treasury , and sapped political will , especially as the state of the economy remains at the center of the debate in @entity287			1
our absence from the fight is going to cost us if the @entity3 regime fails , leaving rebel groups like @entity4 dictating the direction , pace and scope of a new @entity13			0
read more : @entity13 rebel leader talks victory and squalor given that managing affairs in the @entity300 has never been one of our strong suits , the question at this point should be how can the @entity54 , particularly the @entity5 , best engage groups that might be inimical to @entity54 values but necessary to our interests in the @entity300 ? for that , i am not sure there is a clear or simple answer			1
one opportunity would be if the @entity54 uses its designation of @entity4 as both a stick and carrot , cajoling and encouraging it to enter into mainstream politics when ( or if ) the @entity3 regime falls			0
my read of @entity4 , however , is that , like @entity109 , it does not aspire to be a political player and is unlikely to settle for a political role in the new government			0
instead , it may aim to play the spoiler for any transitional government and use its resources and political violence to empower and encourage other like - minded extremists			0
with time and opportunity , @entity4 could not only add to regional instability in the @entity300 , but also rekindle global jihad			0

@entity54 declared a key **opposition** group in @entity13 a terrorist organization
new report says it is the most effective group in the **opposition** , with 5,000 fighters
@entity343 : the group has ties to @entity28 but also seeks to provide social services
she says the chances are slim that it could be *persuaded* to give up radical goals
