-- the family of @entity3 has long said the pregnant @entity5 woman was brain dead , but now it has the medical records to confirm it , lawyers said friday			1
" we have recently received @entity3 's medical records , and can now confirm that mrs. @entity3 is clinically brain dead , and therefore deceased under @entity5 law , " attorneys @entity10 and @entity12 said in an e-mail			1
meanwhile , the judge in the case has recused herself from " all remaining proceedings " and asked that another judge be assigned , according to the order for recusal			0
no reason for the recusal is cited , and @entity25 , a spokeswoman for the @entity27 district attorney 's office , said the office learned late wednesday afternoon that the judge had stepped down			2
the case was transferred to the 96th @entity30 in the county , according to a court order signed friday			0
" i do not have any other details , and we will have no further comment at this time , " she said			0
@entity3 's husband , @entity37 , asked a court tuesday to force a hospital to take her off a respirator , ventilator and other machines , saying her wishes should n't be disregarded just because she is pregnant			1
@entity44 filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against @entity47 , both with the same goal : to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial			2
" @entity3 is legally dead , and to further conduct surgical procedures on a deceased body is nothing short of outrageous , " her husband says in the motion			1
@entity44 -- like his wife , a paramedic by training -- said previously that doctors told him his wife " had lost all activity in her brain stem , " and an accompanying chart stated that she was " brain dead , " according to his lawsuit			1
the hospital referred requests for comment to the @entity27 district attorney 's office , which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit			1
it is legal counsel for @entity47 " in a number of civil areas			0
" in a brief court document filed friday , the civil defendant said simply , " @entity87 d / b / a @entity87 generally denies , each and every , all and singular , the allegations contained in @entity83 's @entity82 and demands strict proof of the same			2
" at this time , no hearing has been scheduled in the case			0
hospital spokesman @entity90 said last month that doctors were simply trying to obey a @entity5 law that says " you can not withhold or withdraw life - sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient			1
" @entity3 's husband responded by saying that " @entity3 can not possibly be a pregnant patient -- @entity3 is dead			1
" furthermore , he argued that her wishes -- relayed , he said , in conversations but not in writing that she not be on " life - sustaining " measures when she is brain dead -- should n't be treated differently from a man or other woman simply because of her pregnancy			1
mother of pregnant woman on life support : change the law last month , @entity44 discussed with @entity0 affiliate @entity111 his wife 's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views			1
" we 'd seen things out in the field			0
we both knew that we did n't want to be on life support , " he said			2
" we reached a point where you wish your wife 's body would just stop			2
" @entity124 , @entity3 's mother , said tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband , @entity127 , agree with @entity44 that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines			1
' against the expressed will ' of family as the lawsuit details , the story began at 2 a.m. on november 26 , when @entity37 found his wife unconscious on the kitchen floor			0
at the time , she was 14 weeks ' pregnant with the couple 's second child			1
soon after that , she was taken to @entity47 , where @entity44 says he was told that his wife " was for all purposes brain dead			1
" the family also says the fetus may have been deprived of oxygen			0
in the lawsuit , he says subsequent measures taken at the hospital -- and , in turn , the state law used to justify them -- amount " to nothing more than the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body against the expressed will of the deceased and her family			1
" " @entity3 's death is a horrible and tragic circumstance , but by no means should ( the hospital ) be entitled to continue cutting into her deceased body in front of her husband and family under the guise of ' life - sustaining ' treatment , " the lawsuit says			1
dr. @entity167 , director of obstetrical clinical research and quality assurance at @entity170 , works on complicated pregnancies and prenatal diagnosis			0
he says nothing scientifically in @entity3 's pregnancy is black and white			1
" a lot depends , first of all , on how long the patient here was deprived of oxygen , or otherwise compromised			0
we can certainly use tools like ultrasound and @entity182 to sometimes see where there has been injury as a result of low blood pressure or low oxygen			0
but just seeing that things look well is n't the same as saying that things will be well , " he told @entity0			0
" those things ca n't perfectly predict health and outcome			0
and there are certainly occasions where as we look as best as we can tell , a fetus seems to be developing appropriately and meeting all its milestones , and yet after birth , after delivery , there is evidence of profound compromise , " @entity167 said			0
@entity206 , a @entity207 law professor who helped write the applicable @entity5 law , said he believes the hospital is misinterpreting it			2
" she 's not a patient anymore , " he said			0
" and so i do n't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really do n't have a patient			0
" the @entity5 law states that a " person may not withdraw or withhold life - sustaining treatment under this subchapter from a pregnant patient			1
" @entity206 said , " the provision they seem to be relying on is called the pregnancy exclusion			0
more than 30 states have this pregnancy exclusion in their law			0
... if they 're relying on that provision , i think @entity5 law in that respect does not compel the provision of life - sustaining treatment			2
" when ' life support ' is really ' death support ' @entity0 's @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			2

new : hospital " denies each and every " allegation by woman 's family
@entity250 has said @entity3 is brain dead , and medical records now prove it , lawyers say
@entity3 was 14 weeks ' pregnant when stricken , and hospital has said it must follow state law
family : @entity3 has no life to sustain , and hospital 's treatment is " cruel and obscene mutilation "
