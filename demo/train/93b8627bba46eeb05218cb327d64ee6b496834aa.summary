news alert : some things you read on the @entity3 are not true			1
as obvious as that may seem , and as savvy as you 'd think we 'd be a decade after deposed @entity8 princes began e-mailing us with the promise of vast riches , 2013 has turned out to be the @entity11			1
and , guess what ? most of us seemed to love every minute of it			1
in just the past week or so , the @entity16 has been duped by the viral rise of a snarky @entity19 airplane spat , a not - so - poor poverty blogger and a @entity22 feud between a comedian and a salsa company			1
and it 's no accident			1
media experts say there are multiple factors at work when these sweet little lies rocket across the web in what feels like mere minutes			1
to be too good to be true , a story has to be good			1
" sometimes , with these stories , we all want them to be true , " said @entity35 , @entity36 's senior media correspondent and host of " @entity38 , " on @entity36 's " newsroom " tuesday			1
" and we forget , maybe , the first rule -- trust , but verify			1
" so , when a pastor claims to teach his congregation a lesson by disguising himself as a homeless man , or a pistol - packing granny unloads on young punks playing " @entity52 , " some of us are so enamored of what the tale says about our world that we miss the warning signs			1
but there 's more to it than that			1
fun little @entity3 stories , it turns out , have become big business			1
" there really is a virality industry , with websites that are in the business of finding these things and blowing them up with slide shows and stories , " @entity35 told @entity36 's @entity63			1
he named @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 as just a few of the many sites that thrive , at least in part , on that model			1
many news sites seek to verify viral content before publishing it , although some of us occasionally get burned			1
in september @entity36 and other sites published a video of a girl appearing to catch on fire during a twerking mishap before the clip was revealed as a prank by @entity91 's talk show			1
there 's obviously an appetite for these sorts of viral stories			1
so finding them , pulling them together quickly and relaunching them on social media within minutes equals page views			1
and online , page views make advertisers happy			2
" there 's a million - clicks reward for being the first to pick up on it , " wrote @entity106 's @entity105 , referring to @entity108 's live - tweeting of his @entity19 airplane " feud			1
" " and hundreds of follow - up , aggregations , commentaries and counter-commentaries get posted before anyone gets around to seeing if the flight data added up			2
" here are just some of the fake viral tales that have swept the @entity16 so far this year			1
we 're willing to bet they wo n't be the last			2
@entity125 's " girlfriend " this one 's almost a year old and still kind of confusing			2
as his @entity128 were playing their way into the @entity131 national championship game , @entity127 linebacker @entity125 broke hearts when he told reporters his girlfriend , a 22 - year - old @entity135 student , had died of leukemia within hours of his grandmother 's death			2
" i miss ' em , but i know that i 'll see them again one day , " he told @entity139 after leading the @entity128 to an improbable 20 - 3 victory over @entity141			2
except , the girlfriend never existed			2
@entity125 would later say he 'd never met @entity144 in person , that their relationship had formed online and that he was the victim of what he called a " sick joke " and what @entity128 dubbed " an elaborate hoax			2
" the homophobic non-tip it had all the right ingredients to stir up web outrage			2
it was n't enough for customers to refuse to tip waitress @entity159 , a 22 - year - old @entity160 veteran , who describes herself as " out , open and proud			2
" someone in the family of four also had to leave a note saying " i 'm sorry but i can not tip because i do not agree with ... your lifestyle and how you live your life			2
" that 's the story @entity159 told media outlets , including @entity36 , last month , and the @entity16 responded in kind			1
more than $ 2,000 flowed in to a @entity171 account set up by her employer , @entity172 in @entity174 , @entity175			2
she said she 'd donate the gifts to the @entity178 and the restaurant planned to match the donations , giving to a local gay - and - lesbian support group			0
but then , a local television station displayed a receipt from a family showing an $ 18 tip on a bill of $ 93.55 -- the same amount on the one @entity159 had originally shared on the @entity188 have a @entity190 group , and a credit card statement with the same total value , $ 111.55 , to back it up			0
this week , @entity159 was suspended at the restaurant , while it completes an investigation of exactly what happened			0
the poverty blogger give @entity198 this : she can write			0
" you have to understand that we know that we will never not feel tired , " she wrote in one of many heartbreaking blog posts about living in poverty that were picked up by the @entity72 and others			0
" we will never feel hopeful			0
we will never get a vacation			0
we know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor			0
it does n't give us much reason to improve ourselves			0
" but here 's the problem			0
she 's apparently not all that poor			0
a @entity214 investigation last week revealed that @entity198 owns her home , has worked as a political consultant , attended a private boarding school and is married to a @entity160			0
but by the time that story was out , @entity198 had already raised more than $ 61,000 in donations via @entity220			0
in an update on the @entity222 , @entity198 wrote , " you have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context , that i never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now , or that i was still quite so abject			0
i am reasonably normally lower working class ... " she says she 'll use the money to collect her writing into a book and maintains that her writing was misinterpreted by readers who thought she was always describing her current living conditions			0
# rip celebrity - who - is - still - alive it 's been more than four years since @entity238 " died " on @entity22			0
but , in 2013 , the social media platform was still killing off celebrities with regularity			1
all , to the best of our knowledge , still alive			0
but all mourned this year on @entity22 where bad information , whether planted intentionally or accidentally , can spread fast			1
it 's gotten so bad that when word of actor @entity255 's death in a car crash broke late saturday , many fans remained skeptical even after legitimate news sources were reporting it			0
@entity259 in @entity260 a reality tv producer just made something up			0
who would have thought ? @entity108 , a producer on @entity265 's " the bachelor , " captivated @entity22 with his @entity19 story about a fellow passenger who was rude to flight attendants on his flight to @entity270			1
@entity108 came to the rescue with a cheeky note , a glass of wine and , ultimately , some lowbrow insults			0
within a day , the @entity16 had split into two camps			0
@entity277 cheered a champion who delivered instant karma to someone being nasty to hapless service - industry folk			0
@entity282 declared @entity108 just as bad , if not worse , for preying upon someone clearly in distress and insulting her in crude language			0
@entity108 declared both teams losers a couple of days later when he returned to @entity22 to share a " photo of @entity259 " -- an empty chair			0
comedian vs. salsa fresh on the heels of @entity277 vs. @entity259 , comedian @entity292 over the weekend started poking fun at what looked like an automated @entity22 feed for @entity296 that would " favorite " anything he wrote about the salsa -- no matter how derogatory or crude			0
what followed was a hilarious and cringe - worthy back - and - forth in which @entity304 employees offered @entity292 free salsa to stop writing bad things about them , argued amongst themselves and generally made a mess of things			0
the main problem being that @entity296 does n't have a @entity22 feed , says its owner , the @entity312 @entity292 says he was himself pranked by other comedians who created the fake account .			1
