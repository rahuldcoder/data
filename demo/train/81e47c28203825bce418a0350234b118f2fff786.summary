-- once upon a time , the @entity2 presence in the @entity3 was largely a regional phenomenon , and outside the @entity6 , a big - city one			1
@entity7 and @entity7 - @entity3 were concentrated in the border and @entity10 states , with an outpost in the @entity13 states ; @entity14 in @entity15 and the @entity16 ; @entity17 in @entity18 and its suburbs			1
certainly not exclusively , but the pattern was largely in place by @entity22 and remained that way for decades			2
then , a couple of things happened			2
as any student of history can tell you , events do n't pass in some orderly procession , but happen in bunches and ricochet around the country			0
the immigration laws were rewritten , swinging the axis of new arrivals away from @entity36 -- after more than a century of enormous human flows from that continent -- to @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41			0
new suburbs sprang up on @entity39 's urban peripheries , the national economy grew rapidly , and @entity39 suffered both economic stagnation and @entity47 - accelerated political turmoil			1
whew ! @entity48 poured into the @entity16 , mostly to @entity18 , escaping instability and poverty back home			0
@entity17 saw their fortunes sink with those of their mainland capital of @entity18 , and headed to @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 looking for a better life , while new arrivals from the island increasingly headed for booming @entity15			0
@entity61 shifted from being a @entity63 home away from home to becoming a financial and cultural capital of @entity39			0
and @entity7 , the largest of @entity39 's constituent groups , spread everywhere , establishing new beachheads in cities large and small , in fading industrial towns and agricultural centers			2
they grew in places that had long been home , like @entity73 and @entity74 , while tiny settlements became bustling communities in places as disparate as @entity79 's @entity78 ; @entity80 , @entity81 ; and the @entity83 stronghold of @entity18			2
big things are happening both in the raw numbers of @entity86 inside the @entity3 , zooming past 50 million in the @entity87 , and inside those numbers in distinct communities			1
@entity14 are no longer a majority among the @entity86 of @entity15 , as large numbers of @entity17 concentrate in midstate counties around @entity93 , and @entity94 and @entity15 and @entity95 continue to flock to @entity96			2
as @entity17 continue to disperse through the @entity16 , @entity48 may soon come to outnumber them in a place where @entity17 once lived in numbers that rivaled @entity100			0
this story is perhaps most stunning in the @entity102 , in the states of the @entity104			1
through most of @entity3 history , the states from @entity106 to @entity107 were among the most uniformly native - born places in the @entity3 there was no southern @entity112 era , no great wave of arrivals crowding ethnic ghettoes in @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118			1
now the increases in the @entity2 population are being measured in hundreds of percentage points			1
the governor of @entity81 appoints a commission on @entity2 affairs			1
school districts that never did so in their history now must hire teachers of @entity129 as a second language			0
@entity86 are unique among @entity3 immigrants			1
unlike the @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134 , and the @entity135 , they were already long - settled inhabitants of what would become the @entity3 when the @entity137 was written			1
@entity39 came to them in the form of purchase , invasion , and annexation			0
then , later , when the modern borders of the continent - spanning superpower were established , @entity86 came from their own countries too			2
it gave @entity86 a unique cultural deposit in this country as it was forming , and a role to play in defining the culture in 2013 and for generations to come			0
understanding the last 500 years will help you understand your country and your country 's history better , and it is indispensable for making sense of what 's to come			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

latinos were already living in what would become the @entity3 before the nation existed
@entity3 @entity2 population is *growing* fast , and *traditional* *demographic* patterns are shifting
once , @entity2 presence was mainly in a few regions , but that has changed *dramatically*
the @entity102 , once uniformly native - born , now has large @entity2 communities
