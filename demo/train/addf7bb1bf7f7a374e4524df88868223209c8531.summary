the struggle for democracy is not dead , say @entity3 's pro-democracy activists , who have pledged to continue opposing @entity4 despite setbacks			1
the activist group @entity6 had hoped that their threats of a mass sit - in in @entity3 's downtown @entity9 would convince @entity11 to approve open democratic elections for @entity3 's next leader			1
but on sunday , the @entity11 government said the elections should only consist of candidates approved by a @entity4 - backed committee , dealing a blow to democracy supporters			1
even the leader of the movement seemed deflated			0
" up to this point , we failed , " @entity22 , the co-founder of @entity6 , told @entity23 tuesday			0
" @entity4 refused to back down			0
" but @entity27 - man , a fellow co-founder , told @entity28 on wednesday that @entity22 's remarks did not mean surrender			2
" we may not have attained that specific goal , " he said , referring to the hoped - for reforms			0
" but we want to create a resistant movement in @entity3			2
as long as the democratic spirit continues in @entity3 , we will not give up			2
" ' we will occupy @entity6 ' @entity27 said @entity6 will proceed with its mass sit - in " soon , " bringing downtown @entity3 to a halt			1
it 's the culmination of years of pent - up unhappiness			2
when @entity3 , a former colony of the @entity41 , was returned to @entity11 rule in 1997 , the two countries struck an agreement promising @entity3 the democratic election of its own leader , known as the chief executive			1
but the democratic reforms have not materialized			0
seventeen years after the handover , the city 's chief executive is chosen by a committee filled with @entity4 loyalists , leading to frustration among pro-democracy @entity54 who want the city 's leader to be chosen by local people , not @entity11			1
that 's why many of them see @entity11 's recent proposal as a bitter sham			1
the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) proposed sunday the @entity3 public be given the right to vote for its next leader â€” but only on up to three candidates approved by a @entity4 - backed committee			1
@entity72 's activists ' chosen response , civil disobedience , is similarly controversial			2
@entity11 officials have repeatedly said occupying @entity9 would be an illegal act that would jeopardize @entity3 's economic security			1
@entity3 's own security chief has warned the protest could turn violent , and " things could get out of control			1
" in august , an " @entity83 " march organized by pro-government activists drew tens of thousands			0
" we want universal suffrage , but not at any cost , " said its organizer @entity84			0
' @entity89 ' @entity3 streets are n't the only thing that 'll be paralyzed			2
a group of 26 pro-democracy legislators has said they will vote down any undemocratic proposal			2
without their votes , @entity4 's reform proposal will not have the necessary votes to become @entity3 law , resulting in gridlock			1
" we are going to veto it to show our determination that we are not going to accept this fake democracy , " said @entity101 , a pro-democracy legislator who is involved with @entity6			2
@entity106 , @entity11 's deputy secretary - general of the @entity108 , has said @entity54 only have themselves to blame for lack of reform if they veto @entity4 's proposal			1
this has effectively set up a standoff between @entity3 and @entity4			2
@entity114 , another pro-democracy legislator , said @entity3 is becoming " ungovernable			0
" without a popular mandate , the next chief executive will face serious challenges as he or she tries to control an increasingly upset civil society			0
" there will be a new age of civil disobedience and non-cooperation across the board , " @entity114 told @entity28			0
but , he added , @entity3 spiraling into chaos may also persuade @entity11 leaders that robust democratic reforms are what 's needed to regain stability			1
" it 's like a phoenix rebirth sort of thing			0
we 're getting worse in order to get better			0
" international support in recent days , @entity137 governments have spoken up in defense of @entity3 's democracy activists			1
@entity41 lawmakers have announced plans to visit @entity3 to conduct an inquiry into whether its handover treaty is being violated by @entity11 's actions			1
but @entity11 's @entity64 has responded angrily , calling the inquiry a " highly inappropriate act which constitutes interference in @entity11 's internal affairs			1
" in the @entity151 , @entity150 spokeswoman @entity149 said the @entity151 government " supports universal suffrage in @entity3 in accordance with the @entity154 and the aspirations of the @entity3 people			0
" " we believe that an open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by rule of law is essential for @entity3 's stability and prosperity			1
" but @entity3 's democracy activists doubt the @entity151 or @entity41 can make a big difference			1
" i do not have much hope on these two governments in particular , " said @entity101			0
" of course they should say something , if they still have the moral fiber to stand up to the strong economic pressure of @entity11			0
they should know what is right and what is wrong ... if they have the guts to do it			0
" @entity101 said he and other legislators are currently requesting an " urgent appeal " with the @entity180 and the @entity181 on the @entity182 ( @entity182 ) , to examine whether the rights of @entity54 are being violated			0
opinion : why @entity4 is courting trouble in @entity3			0
