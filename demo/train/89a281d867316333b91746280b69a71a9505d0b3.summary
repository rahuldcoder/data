@entity0 approved tougher penalties for racist behavior , including possible relegation , in a move that one anti-racism organization said will bring soccer " in line " with other sports			1
the sanctions , @entity0 revealed at its congress in @entity11 on friday , come in two stages			1
they were initiated at a time when incidents of racism continue to make headlines around the world and several months after @entity0 set up an anti-racism task force			1
punishments for first offenses bring a warning , fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums			0
a second offense , or one deemed " serious , " could result in demotion , a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament			1
soccer 's global governing body also said that any individual committing a racist infraction should be suspended for at least five matches			1
it 's now up to @entity0 's member associations , who number more than 200 , to implement the new punishments			2
only one member -- it was n't known which one -- voted against the measures			0
" there have been despicable events this year that have cast a long shadow over football and the rest of society , " @entity0 president @entity45 said			2
" i am speaking of the politics of hate -- racism , ignorance , discrimination , intolerance , small - minded prejudice , that uncivilized , immoral and self - destructive force that we all detest			0
" @entity62 of @entity63 walked off in protest when he was racially abused during a friendly in january , and @entity67 's football federation banned @entity69 ' @entity68 for five games in april and fined him for a @entity72 - style goal celebration			0
kick it out , the anti-racist body , welcomed friday 's development			0
" it is something the organization has been campaigning on , and stricter punishments for discrimination more generally , for many years , " chair lord @entity76 said on @entity77 's web site			0
" we hope to see the practical implications of this ruling			0
" @entity0 is setting an example to bring football in line with other sports which do n't have problems around discrimination and unacceptable behavior			1
" meanwhile , @entity0 announced three women would take their place on the executive committee , which votes , for instance , on where the @entity98 is held .			2
