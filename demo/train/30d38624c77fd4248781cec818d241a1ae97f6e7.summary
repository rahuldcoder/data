@entity0 -- thirty years ago , on march 26 , 1979 , three couples sat down for a celebratory lunch in the @entity4			1
@entity5 remembers the joy she felt when the @entity7 brought peace between @entity9 and @entity10			1
president @entity11 and first lady @entity12 , @entity10 prime minister @entity13 and his wife @entity14 , and @entity9 president @entity15 and his wife @entity16 , talked privately before greeting the hundreds of people who witnessed the signing of the historic peace treaty between @entity9 and @entity10 that day			1
@entity5 remembers crying with joy that day at seeing @entity10 and @entity9 putting aside their differences and talking simply as people			1
@entity15 and @entity13 shared the 1978 @entity24 for the treaty they negotiated under the auspices of president @entity11			1
her happiness was shattered october 6 , 1981 , when @entity15 was gunned down while reviewing a military parade			1
@entity16 and @entity15 had been married for 32 years			1
the daughter of a @entity34 teacher and an @entity9 government official , she met the former @entity37 officer at her cousin 's house , not long after he had been released from prison for opposing @entity34 's occupation of @entity9			2
she was 15 and he was almost 30 , but they fell in love and married soon after			0
in her new book , " @entity48 , " @entity5 says she was crushed by her husband 's death and at first almost immobilized			1
but she eventually decided to continue her work outside the home			0
today she splits her time between homes in @entity9 and in @entity52 and seeks to continue her husband 's work for peace while finding time for her grandchildren and for gardening			1
a teacher who earned a ph.d. in comparative literature , she is a senior fellow with the @entity61 at the @entity62			0
@entity5 spoke with @entity1 wednesday			2
here are excerpts from that conversation : @entity1 : one of the things you do in the book is to attempt to correct the misconceptions that most @entity69 have about @entity70			2
what do you think is the biggest myth that people have about @entity70 ? @entity15 : i noticed right after 9/11 that the people were not understanding the @entity76 and @entity70 as a religion			1
they were confused between terrorists doing something and @entity70			2
@entity70 has nothing to do with violence , has nothing to do with revenge or things like that			2
@entity70 is a religion for peace , for love , for tolerance			1
but i understand why people think that way			2
my husband was killed by fanatics			2
but these fanatics , i believe , they are not @entity76 , they do n't belong to any religion because no religion tells you to kill , including @entity70 , of course			1
it does not tell you to kill			0
it does not tell you to commit suicide			0
@entity1 : what 's your impression of @entity108 ? @entity15 : i am thrilled and happy , i ca n't tell you			1
i was following his campaign			0
first of all i feel he has so many things in common with my husband , he has ... the same smile , the same devotion to their country , the same charisma , the same love for the people			2
both were devoted to their countries very much and wanted to do something for their people ... i have hope , to tell you the truth , that president @entity108 will help in bringing peace in the @entity128 , which will calm the terrorists down			1
@entity1 : what impact do you think the @entity134 violence and the recent @entity10 election are going to have on the prospects for peace ? @entity15 : i am very optimistic that what my husband did , what he gave his life for will never , ever go in vain			1
i believe , though i 'm not young , that i will see peace prevailing in the @entity128 between the @entity143 and the @entity10 , and i am a very realistic woman			1
i am not living in fantasy or illusion			0
when @entity15 started making peace with @entity10 ... people could n't believe it			1
they said it will never happen , but it did happen and my husband made it			2
and that 's why i feel it will happen in our time			0
i want to see them living side - by - side in a very peaceful atmosphere			0
the problem is not with the people , the problem is with the leaders			0
and i hope [ incoming @entity10 prime minister @entity166 ] @entity167 this time will do like president [ @entity169 ] begin did			0
@entity13 was @entity171 and he was not an easy man , but he was a leader and he did make peace with @entity9 , with @entity15 and with the help of president @entity11			1
@entity1 : what 's the current relationship between @entity10 and @entity9 ? @entity15 : it 's not bad at all , it 's good , but i wish it would be even more intimate			1
but what affects the relationship between @entity9 and @entity10 is the aggression of the @entity10 people in @entity134 ... the @entity156 are wrong to send rockets			0
they should sit and negotiate like @entity15 and @entity13 did ... but the revenge of @entity10 is so harsh , so hard on the people there , and who died ? it was not the people @entity10 wanted to get rid of			1
no , it was the innocent people , women and children ... @entity1 : some people are critical of @entity9 for not allowing residents of @entity134 to cross the border			0
@entity15 : well , there are rules in @entity9			2
we are a country that has rules and when you want to cross the border there are rules to be followed			0
of course i can also understand , they were suffering a lot , that 's why they crossed in thousands and thousands to the border of @entity9 ... @entity1 : you mentioned in the book that when your husband was assassinated , you were in the reviewing stand			1
how far away were you ? @entity15 : i was just a few meters behind him ... my guard pushed me to the ground , that 's what saved me really			1
and i was terrified and shocked ... @entity1 : you wrote about how this was a very crushing blow and you had a hard time adjusting			0
@entity15 : you know we were not only wife and husband , we were two partners loving each other , respecting each other , trying to do something together for our country			1
when he was assassinated , it was like you took away half of me			0
it was not that easy , but thank @entity235 i got over it after a while and instead of staying at home and doing nothing and just having grief , i went out and continued my teaching			0
i went to the @entity69 , i taught in four universities ... and now i am settled with the @entity62 , and there is a chair there named for my husband for development and peace			2
i am filling my life and continuing his work for peace with dignity , with honor and justice			0
@entity1 : march 26 is the 30th anniversary of the formal signing of the @entity7			0
were you at the @entity4 for the signing that day ? @entity15 : of course , i was there , i was with my family and with my children			1
it was unforgettable to see the @entity10 delegation and the @entity9 delegation and the @entity69 delegation and instead of enemies they were friends , talking and chatting			0
it was something that i would never ever forget			0
my tears were coming down , i could hardly control them , because i was so happy to see that we are all like one family			0
and that 's why i am dying to see peace between the @entity10 and the @entity156 and the @entity276 and the @entity277 so we can live as one family and concentrate on our problems			2
we have so many problems in our countries to solve , we have to raise the standard of the people , we have poverty , we have illiteracy			0
let us concentrate on this , not concentrate on waging war .			0

she says @entity70 is a religion of peace and the people of the @entity128 want peace
