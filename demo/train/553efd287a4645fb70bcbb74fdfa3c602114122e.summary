-- the growth of e-commerce in @entity3 has outpaced that of western countries during the past five years			1
this is largely due to the rapid growth of internet users , improved online payments , increasing coverage and improving services			0
such a trend will continue in the next five years with sales volume predicted to remain at 27 % cost of goods sold			0
among all the e-commerce business models , business - to - consumer e-commerce is outgrowing others due to its credibility , scale , and services variety and scope			1
by 2017 , business - to - consumer e-commerce in @entity3 is predicted to double its share and reach 46 % of the total online sale , according to the @entity27			1
@entity29 's fast growth illustrates this trend			1
in the five years since its launch in july 2008 , @entity29 has increased its selection from 3,000 stock - keeping units to over 2 million , fulfillment centers from one in @entity37 to 17 in seven cities , revenue from 4 million yuan to over 6 billion yuan , and employees from 40 people to over 9,000			1
@entity29 , which started as an online supermarket by offering mostly fast - moving consumer products , now boasts categories ranging from consumer electronics , apparel , books to mom and baby products			1
@entity3 , in its current state , lends itself perfectly to e-commerce			1
the rising incomes of its massive population pave the foundation for a growing user base and this population 's density and residential infrastructure allow for efficient logistics			0
and that 's only the beginning			0
@entity3 's @entity66 user penetration is barely 43 % compared to the @entity67 , which is near 80 % , and its online shopping penetration is less than 40 % of its internet user base , about half of the @entity67 if these statistics reach the @entity67 levels , e-commerce in @entity3 will triple its scale			1
characteristics of @entity3 e-commerce @entity3 's e-commerce industry has many unique characteristics , some a result of its nascent state and some a result of @entity3 's intrinsic cultural behaviors			1
@entity29 exemplifies several of these characteristics			1
cash on delivery ( @entity85 ) is still a popular means of payment due to lack of trust in both online payment systems and the e-commerce providers themselves			1
however , when people start to gain trust through trial purchases , they shift towards online payment			0
when we launched @entity29 in 2008 , we had more than 70 % of orders paying @entity85 , but now it is less than 20 %			1
last mile delivery is mostly done on mopeds and motorcycles due to dense city traffic and the high cost of delivery by trucks			0
the logistics industry is very fragmented in @entity3 , with the likes of @entity109 and @entity110 in @entity3 still unable to provide nationwide coverage and quality service			2
many large e-commerce companies have chosen to build their own last mile delivery capabilities to ensure a better customer experience and to facilitate faster growth			0
in 2011 , @entity29 started our own last mile delivery alongside 30 third party logistics partnerships , allowing us to cover the entire nation			2
such a decision was based on the fact that more than 60 % of our customers ' complaints were centered around delivery services			0
very soon , our own last mile delivery services started to bear fruit with a significantly improved customer experience and a 10 % improvement in our @entity129 ( customer satisfaction ) score			0
as our order density increases over time , our delivery cost also declines			0
in 2012 , we launched the service by @entity29 ( @entity136 ) model to provide our merchants with logistics , marketing , platform , and data services			2
through @entity136 , our last mile delivery fleet not only serves our own customers , but also merchants who sell through their own website or through other marketplace platforms			0
this has further helped us reduce our last mile delivery costs			0
@entity3 shoppers ' behavior is quite different from western countries			2
for example , online shoppers in the @entity67 are used to opening one window at a time and flipping back and forth via navigation buttons , but @entity3 online shoppers prefer that each click opens a new window allowing them to navigate a site by jumping between several windows			1
the user interface of e-commerce websites in the @entity67 are usually very simple and clean with plenty of images , but @entity3 shoppers favor crowded websites with information and links all packed into one page providing the impression of a high - energy shopping atmosphere			1
@entity29 's first homepage was simple and clean mimicking that of such model websites in the western countries , but after receiving our users ' feedback , we quickly made changes			1
in general , @entity3 consumers are very price sensitive and right now , @entity3 e-commerce is primarily a promotion driven business			1
shoppers do not yet value the concept of " time is money			0
" whereas , in the western countries , shoppers are willing to pay considerable fees for expedited delivery , this behavior in @entity3 is rare			2
challenges faced by multi-national companies not many successes for multi-national internet companies ( not only e-commerce companies ) can be found in @entity3			1
failed or struggling examples include @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204			0
reasons include : a ) insufficient understanding of @entity3 consumers ' shopping behavior , simply copying global business models to fit @entity3 's market ; b ) management is not localized , not adapting for local competition ; c ) higher operational cost than local companies due to compliance and operational overhead ; d ) improper organizational structure , resulting in low decision efficiency			1
e-commerce is a fiercely competitive field , needing much faster and dynamic decisions and local management teams need to be more empowered to respond to the dynamics of the local market			0
@entity29 received an investment by @entity225 in 2011 , establishing our strategic partnership			2
we share resources in sourcing , logistics , e-commerce technology , and private label products			2
this partnership has helped @entity29 to provide @entity3 consumers with more choices , better service and even better prices			1
it is more beneficial for multi-national companies and brands to conduct e-commerce in @entity3 through strategic partnerships or through an e-commerce solution provider to ensure a higher success rate			1
trends in e-commerce in @entity3 @entity3 's e-commerce industry is experiencing a transition from online shopping as more of a niche market towards online shopping becoming a lifestyle			1
it is evolving from tasting new , special , and hard - to - find products to buying daily consumption needs such as food , drinks , toothpastes and shampoos			0
mobile commerce is growing at an even faster rate			0
consumers using mobile apps exhibit different buying behavior from those using personal computers			0
for example , @entity29 's traffic on personal computers and on mobile apps peak at different hours of the day and different days of the week			2
our mobile traffic peaks in the evenings and weekends while personal computer traffic peaks in the early afternoons and during weekdays			0
orders on apps are usually smaller , but with a higher frequency and people using both devices are more loyal and sticky			0
e-commerce in @entity3 is also rapidly penetrating third and fourth tier cities , predominantly due to growing @entity66 penetration , a local shortage of shopping malls and supermarkets , and an overall lack of available products			1
social commerce is also starting to blossom in @entity3			2
people trust their friends , opinion leaders and fellow consumers			0
the advancement of @entity293 and social networking sites has accelerated this			0
@entity29 started social commerce five years ago by embedding our website into a well - know social networking site @entity300			1
@entity29 's official @entity293 site has attracted over 2 million fans and some of this site 's marketing events have resulted in over one million message forwards			2
there is also a trend of integration in the @entity66 world in @entity3			2
in the past , we have independent portals : search sites , navigation sites , game sites , social networks , and e-commerce , but many are being integrated to provide customers with one - stop service			2
on november 11 , 2012 , @entity3 's e-commerce industry single handedly created a nationwide promotions holiday which we referred to as " @entity322			1
" online sales reached 30 % of total national retail , a number that will no doubt become the norm in the near future			0
we are fortunate to witness this change and proud to be a part of making this happen .			0

by 2017 , business - to - consumer e-commerce in @entity3 is predicted to double its share
@entity29 , an online grocery business , has boomed since 2008 launch
