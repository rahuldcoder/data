few airline routes are as cutthroat as the one between @entity1 and @entity2			1
it is the world 's busiest intercontinental route and -- peppered with business travelers -- one of the most lucrative			1
there are few lengths airlines wo n't go to in the hopes of getting a piece of the action			1
we look at how the different carriers stack up			0
@entity14 : it 's all business ( class ) it may not be the cheapest way to travel between the two cities , but @entity14 ' all - business class flight is definitely one of the plushest			2
aimed at @entity1 's and @entity2 's bankers , it is also one of the few flights to leave from @entity26			1
perks include all the standard business class amenities -- gourmet food , lie - flat beds , airport lounge access -- as well as some innovative extras			0
instead of a traditional in - flight entertainment system , for instance , customers are given use of their very own @entity37			2
perhaps the sweetest offering , however , is that passengers get to skip the line at customs			0
to facilitate this , the plane makes a pit stop at @entity46 's @entity45 , which introduced a pre-clearance facility in 2009			2
it helps that @entity14 has partnered with @entity49			0
together , the two carriers own the largest market share ( 53 % ) of this route , and offer the most flights -- 17 a day -- between the two cities			2
@entity55 : when in doubt , merge last year , neither @entity57 nor @entity58 held a particularly admirable market share of the @entity1 - @entity2 route			1
then , they decided to merge , with @entity55 acquiring 49 % of the @entity63 carrier			0
for @entity55 , the move meant the ability to offer three times as many flights between the two hubs			0
for @entity55 , it meant access to new , untapped markets in the @entity72 " we are a @entity63 - based airline , and we need to offer a set of flights and services and attractive features to customers in the @entity63 first and foremost , " admits @entity73 , ceo of @entity58			1
" we need to expand our network in order to do so , and @entity55 helps us going in one direction -- but it is the direction that is the biggest for us			0
" since the merger , the airlines have acquired 33 % of the market on that route			1
still , the two airlines have retained their separate identity , with separate perks			2
for @entity55 's @entity72 - bound @entity93 customers ( the frequent , frequent flyers who cover at least 125,000 miles per year ) , a @entity91 will transfer them between gates			1
lie - flat beds and gourmet food ( with wine pairings ) are par for the course on business class flights , though @entity55 stands out by also providing @entity103 in - flight bedding			0
@entity55 also offers the @entity106 program , an expedited meal that lets flyers chill out for the remainder of their journey			0
younger road warriors traveling in business class , meanwhile , are drawn to @entity55 's cool lighting , on - board bar and limousine pick - up service			2
the @entity115 -- @entity55 's upper class lounge -- meanwhile excels at offering the unexpected , including free - flowing cocktails , and restaurant - quality meals			2
there is even a spa to help visitors unwind before a flight			0
@entity123 : the underdog @entity123 , which merged with @entity125 in 2010 , ca n't hope to compete with the other industry giants , who have invested a lot of time and money on the @entity2 - @entity1 route			1
though they offer the fewest daily flights ( five ) , the carrier has made inroads			0
@entity123 has set up a plush hub in @entity137 's newly renovated @entity136			0
on the @entity2 - end , they fly into @entity138 , which offers smaller queues than @entity140			1
@entity141 , @entity123 's ceo , also says the airline is working with its strengths			1
" our position is basically that we offer a good service out of @entity2			1
it 's not as big as @entity14 's , but we offer a good schedule and we offer our entire network with a lot of connecting opportunities , " he says .			0

@entity1 to @entity2 is the world 's busiest airline route
eager to cash in , airlines have *devised* new ways to lure customers
airlines will try anything , from @entity91 rides to merging , to win the route
