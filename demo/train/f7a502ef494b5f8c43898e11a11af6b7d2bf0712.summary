-- african ministers and health experts are meeting in @entity3 with one thing on their minds : how to stop the biggest ever outbreak of the ebola virus from extending its deadly reach still further			1
the @entity10 has warned that " drastic action " is needed to halt the killer in its tracks			1
it reports there have been 759 cases , including 467 deaths , in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 as of june 30			2
the outbreak began in march			2
this makes it the " largest in terms of the number of cases and deaths as well as geographical spread , " said @entity10			1
not only is it uncontained , but this strain of the ebola virus can kill up to 90 % of those infected			1
read more : what you need to know about @entity37 the scientist who first discovered the ebola virus in the 1970s , dr. @entity40 , told @entity0 's @entity41 that the situation is " unprecedented			1
" " one , [ this is ] the first time in @entity44 that we have such an outbreak , " he said			1
" secondly , it is the first time that three countries are involved			0
and thirdly it 's the first time that we have outbreaks in capitals , in capital cities			0
" the looming threat has brought together the health ministers of 11 @entity44 nations -- the @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity3 , @entity19 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity21 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity20 and @entity62 -- as well as health experts , @entity37 survivors , and @entity10 representatives			1
also present at the two - day summit in @entity67 , @entity3 , are the representatives of airlines and mining companies , as well as donor nations helping to fund efforts to combat the virus			1
new cases of the virus continue to be reported			2
between june 25 and 30 , 22 new cases of the virus were reported in @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity20 , @entity10 said			1
of those , 14 died			0
exposure to body fluids @entity37 is a violent killer			1
the symptoms , at first , mimic the flu : headache , fever , fatigue			0
what comes next sounds like something out of a horror movie : significant diarrhea and vomiting , while the virus shuts off the blood 's ability to clot			2
as a result , patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging			0
many die in an average of 10 days			0
people are traveling without realizing they 're carrying the deadly virus			2
it can take between two and 21 days after exposure for someone to feel sick			0
the good news is that @entity37 is n't as easily spread as one may think			1
a patient is n't contagious -- meaning they ca n't spread the virus to other people -- until they are already showing symptoms			1
then , the disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected animals or people , according to @entity10			1
in april , @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity118 traveled to @entity119 , @entity19 , to report on what was being done to treat patients and contain the outbreak			2
" it took only moments to feel the impact of what was happening here , " @entity118 wrote after landing in @entity119			0
" there is a lot we know about @entity37 , and it scares us almost as much as what we do n't know			1
" fighting an epidemic @entity133 , also known as @entity134 © decins @entity135 ¨ res , has been working to fight the epidemic since march			0
but it warned in a news release last week that a " massive deployment of resources " is needed by @entity44 nations and other organizations , saying it has reached the limit of what its teams can do			1
ebola outbreaks usually are confined to remote areas , making the disease easier to contain			0
but this outbreak is different ; patients have been identified in 60 locations in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			0
" the epidemic is out of control , " says dr. @entity152 , @entity133 director of operations			0
" with the appearance of new sites in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 , there is a real risk of it spreading to other areas			0
" officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as @entity119			1
the capital of @entity19 has a population of 2 million and an international airport			0
complicating matters , the countries hit hardest by the epidemic have major medical infrastructure challenges			0
there is also a real sense of mistrust toward health workers from communities			0
in @entity20 and @entity19 , @entity10 has said that community members have thrown stones at health care workers trying to investigate the outbreak			1
@entity133 has treated 470 people , it said last week , of which 215 were confirmed cases			0
however , it is now " having difficulty responding to the large number of new cases and locations , " it said			0
while public anxiety is high , the statement said , governments and civil society groups are doing too little to acknowledge the scale of the epidemic or educate people about how to stop the spread of the disease			1
another organization helping victims is @entity202 , an international christian aid group			0
it has doctors in @entity205 , the capital of @entity21 , and near the border with @entity19			0
@entity207 ' should be easy to stop ' there is no cure for @entity37 , but in theory the disease should be easy to fight , @entity40 told @entity0			1
" you need really close contact to become infected			2
so just being on the bus with someone with @entity37 , that 's not a problem			2
" simple hygienic measures like washing with soap and water , not re-using syringes , and avoiding contact with infected corpses are sufficient to stop spread of the disease , @entity40 said			1
" this is an epidemic of dysfunctional health systems , " he added			2
" fear of the virus , and the lack of trust in government , in the health system , is as bad as the actual virus			2
" @entity0 's @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238 contributed to this report .			0
