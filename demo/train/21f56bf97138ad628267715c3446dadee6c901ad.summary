-- @entity2 's president has declined to sign a bill that would punish certain homosexual acts with life in prison , but the move was not designed to protect the civil rights of gays and lesbians			1
president @entity12 believes that parliament illegally passed the bill , and gays and lesbians are " sick people who need help , " his spokesman said			1
a @entity2 lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts			0
it was briefly shelved when @entity23 and other @entity25 nations threatened to withdraw aid to @entity2 , which relies on millions of dollars from the international community			0
the nation 's parliament passed the bill last month , supplanting the death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for " aggravated homosexuality			1
" it was awaiting the president 's signature for passage			1
news came friday that the president had sent a letter to the speaker of the parliament , saying he ca n't sign the bill because there were n't enough parliament members present when it was passed			2
" there was no quorum which ( was ) mandated for bill passage			2
thus , he is unable to sign a bill that was not legally passed , " spokesman @entity51 said			2
the spokesman further explained @entity12 's thinking about the issue			2
they are sick , " @entity51 said			0
" homosexuals were present in @entity60 in the past and were not persecuted			0
" the president also believes that the issue is not a priority for his country			0
" it might be important in @entity25 , but not here , " @entity51 said			0
" the president 's inability to sign the bill is very clear and his stance has not changed			1
... there was no quorum , and homosexuals are sick people who need help			1
" according to @entity79 , the bill 's definition of " aggravated homosexuality " includes acts in which a person is infected with @entity82 , " serial offenders " and sex with minors			1
the bill also proposed years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to gays and lesbians , a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			1
homosexuality is illegal in most @entity60 countries , where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism			0
in @entity2 , homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison , according to rights activists			2
but lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation , saying the influence of @entity111 lifestyles risks destroying family units			0
" this is a piece of legislation that is needed in this country to protect the traditional family here in @entity60 , and also protect the future of our children , " said @entity113 , the lawmaker who introduced the bill			0
rights groups and the international community had urged @entity12 to veto the bill			0
@entity126 is in recess and wo n't reconvene until february 18 , parliament spokesman @entity125 said			1
the bill can become law without the president 's signature if @entity12 returns it to parliament twice and it garners the support of two - thirds of lawmakers , he said			1
journalist @entity136 and @entity137 contributed to this report .			0
