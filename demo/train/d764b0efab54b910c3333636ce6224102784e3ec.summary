-- a single gene , called @entity3 , may be responsible for many cases of kidney disease among african - americans , researchers say			1
dr. @entity7 , right , speaks with a colleague in a dialysis center at @entity10			0
although doctors have blamed hypertension for causing common forms of kidney disease in african - americans , new research shows that high blood pressure may not be the chief cause			1
" the myh9 gene association in @entity27 kidney disease is the most powerful genetic cause of a common disease yet discovered , " said dr. @entity7 , professor of internal medicine and nephrology at @entity21 , who led a team of researchers in isolating the gene			1
about 70 percent of african - americans with non-diabetic forms kidney disease have the @entity3 gene , and many of them end up on dialysis , he said			1
the gene predisposes african - americans to the kidney disease that was thought to stem from high blood pressure			1
it also gives them a higher risk of kidney disease associated with @entity42			2
" this genetic finding will forever change the way that we categorize the causes of kidney disease			0
it has the potential to lead to new treatment options to prevent this devastating disease , " @entity7 said			0
kidney disease is a serious health issue among african - americans , who have a fourfold higher risk of developing all common forms of it than whites in the @entity59			1
dr. @entity60 , president of the @entity61 , called the research " seminal work " in identifying a gene associated with common kidney diseases			2
still , the gene has not been shown to be the sole cause of kidney damage , @entity60 said			0
diabetes and hypertension remain the most common causes of chronic kidney disease in the @entity59 , he said			2
there is no reason to screen all african - americans for the risk variant of this gene , or even all african - americans with high blood pressure , because it is common among all african - americans , @entity7 said			1
genetic screening would be most useful for people who have close relatives on dialysis , meaning they are at high risk , or individuals who want to donate kidneys , he said			0
there have not been studies on who should be screened , he said			0
@entity7 conducted the research along with colleagues at the @entity94 and the @entity95			0
the team discovered that the gene accounts for nearly half of kidney failure among african - americans , including diabetic - related and non-diabetic - related kidney disease			1
researchers are now exploring what kinds of environmental triggers might cause the gene to promote kidney failure			0
@entity42 seems to trigger the gene and cause kidney failure , he said			0
many kidney doctors had theorized that african - americans developed kidney disease more often than whites because they might not get to see their doctors as often , had more severe high blood pressure and faced other environmental stressors , @entity7 said			1
but research shows that the risk variant of the @entity3 gene is more prevalent in among @entity27 populations than white populations and seems to explain much of the excess risk for non-diabetic kidney disease in african - americans , he said			1
it is still important for people to treat hypertension , which can speed up the weakening of kidneys in people with kidney disease , @entity7 said			1
untreated high blood pressure also leads to heart attack and stroke , he said			0
dr. @entity136 , chief wellness officer at the @entity137 and author of " @entity139 : are you as young as you can be ? " said the question still remains whether the gene initiates hypertension and kidney disease , and to what extent hypertension causes kidney disease			2
" most physicians would say that the reason blood pressure is so important is that higher levels of blood pressure cause kidney disease , and kidney disease cause higher levels blood pressure , and there 's a vicious circle , " he said			2
@entity60 also noted that researchers will have to sort out the interactions between the @entity3 gene and hypertension , as well as the gene and diabetes			1
no one knows why @entity27 - @entity59 tend to have a higher risk for hypertension			0
one controversial hypothesis , known as the @entity168 theory , is that black people who survived the harrowing trip across the @entity171 from @entity172 in the holds of ships did so because their bodies were better able to preserve salt , allowing them to avoid death by dehydration			0
therefore , the theory goes , some african - americans have a higher prevalence of " salt - sensitive hypertension " : their blood pressure increases by unusually high amounts in response to salt			1
this theory has not been proved , or even widely studied , but the idea continues to permeate popular culture and generate discussion			0
the isolation of the @entity3 gene does not necessarily refute the theory , @entity136 said			2
" to survive , they had to retain salt , and they had to have a gene to help them do that , " he said .			0

study : @entity198 predisposes african - americans to common kidney disease
interactions between the @entity3 gene and hypertension are still *unknown*
it is still important for people to treat hypertension , *experts* say
