-- recently , a puzzling website appeared that seemed to be from the @entity3			1
using @entity3 's logo and its website 's design , the page contained information about @entity3 's oil drilling activities in the @entity10			1
it included a function where viewers could caption pictures said to be taken by @entity3 in the north ( a dangerous feature for @entity3 -- just imagine the captions people would generate under a picture of a baby @entity10 fox on an oil company website )			1
soon after , a video appeared on @entity24 that seemed to show an event sponsored by @entity3 that went badly awry			1
a small fountain , in the shape of an oil rig , starts spraying guests and some of the pseudo-environmental decorations of the @entity32 frontier with simulated oil			0
finally , in the video , what seemed to be a poorly designed media response by @entity3 made everything worse			1
as you may have guessed ( if you have not already heard ) , the entire thing -- website , video and even @entity3 's response -- was a hoax created by @entity43 and the @entity44 , a group of online activists that targets corporations			1
@entity3 has wisely decided to remain low - key about the whole thing , issuing a press release that clarifies its lack of involvement but otherwise just hoping the whole concocted ensemble would go away			2
is @entity43 's prank on @entity54 a ' scam ' ? welcome to the golden age of culture jamming			1
coined in 1984 , culture jamming is a tactic of subverting the media as a form of protest			1
but the advent of social media has taken it to a whole new level			0
in the old days , culture jamming might mean defacing a billboard , handing out forged fliers , or staging a false corporate or political event and hoping the media would cover it as if it was real			1
but today , a fake video or website can quickly go viral and be spread through tens of thousands of shares , tweets , repostings and imitations			1
it is almost impossible to put that genie back in the bottle			0
social media is emerging as a powerful tool , and neither law nor social consensus has yet caught up with it			0
on the one hand , it allows a remarkable amount of influence to be wielded by those who traditionally had little			0
social media ends the communication dominance of the big players like the mass media and large corporations ; it is the great equalizer			0
from the privacy of one 's computer , virtually the entire world can be one 's audience			0
on the other hand , because it is both relatively cheap and can be so potent , social media is ripe for abuse , whether through scams , gossip , or misrepresentations			0
as a medium of protest , the tool is a mixed blessing			2
certainly , social media provides some balance in the information battle with corporations who have multimillion - dollar public relations and advertising programs			0
but the line between legitimate protest through culture jamming and libelous misrepresentation or trademark infringement is muddy			1
while the legal issues may be contentious , the ethical boundaries seem clearer			0
opinion : why we should look to the @entity10 many sympathize with the intent of the @entity130 protest			2
yet , as much as one might disagree with a particular corporate action , the honest choice demands either engaging in civil protest and accepting the consequences , or staging a symbolic protest ( such as culture jamming , parody , or satire ) that is clearly identifiable as an act of protest			1
the @entity3 hoax did not announce itself as a parody ( though a discerning viewer could detect it ) , and so neglects the second standard			2
satire or parody should be obvious -- maybe not immediately , but soon -- or it is in danger of becoming little more than misrepresentation			2
sometimes misrepresentation is the clear intent of the protester			0
there is a place in a democratic society for such acts ; civil disobedience and other mildly illegal protests have a long history in the @entity160			0
but one must cross legal boundaries , even in protest , with a willingness to accept the consequences			0
if the @entity3 hoax is determined by a court to violate a law ( such as trademark infringement ) , @entity43 and the @entity44 should man up , accept the verdict and pay the appropriate penalty			1
i doubt that such a verdict will impede people from using social media as a medium of protest			0
but if tactics like the @entity3 hoax become accepted and common , they can easily backfire ; opponents could just as easily use the same strategy against an organization like @entity43			1
a culture jamming war would do no one any good			1
the information overload online is already overwhelming and confusing enough			0
we do n't need a situation where we have to question the validity of every website and video we click on			2
let 's keep it clean , everyone -- tell us who you are , and then take your best shot			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity43 , @entity44 stage hoax about @entity3 using fake website and video
@entity203 : welcome to the @entity204 of culture jamming
he says line between legitimate protest and misrepresentation is ethically questionable
