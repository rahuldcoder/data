-- a humanitarian mission from the @entity2 will travel this weekend to @entity4 to look for effects of president @entity7 's protest crackdown , a @entity2 official said thursday shortly after the release of a damning report			1
" we have been guaranteed that we will have full access to anywhere we would wish to go , " under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs @entity13 told reporters after delivering to the @entity15 the report			1
" we will want to concentrate on those places where there have been reports of fighting so that we can see for ourselves exactly what is going on			0
" the mission will last three or four days , during which the group anticipates being accompanied by a representative of the @entity4 @entity27 , she said			1
@entity28 of the @entity29 will lead the mission , she said			0
" it 's an initial mission and we would hope to go back in to do detailed assessments			0
" she added , with diplomatic understatement , " there is continued concern about the humanitarian situation			0
" that concern was raised in the @entity37 on @entity4 , whose report concluded that @entity4 is guilty of human rights violations in its months - long crackdown on protesters and that it may be time for the @entity44 to get involved			1
" the mission found a pattern of human rights violations that constitutes widespread or systematic attacks against the civilian population , which may amount to crimes against humanity , " the report said			1
the violations include murder and disappearances , torture , deprivation of liberty and persecution , it added			1
the @entity2 mission , which was set up by the @entity63 in late april , issued its 22 - page report thursday covering mid-march to @entity65			2
" both the armed forces and the security forces are involved in the suppression of peaceful protests and related violations across @entity4 , " the report says			1
" many of the victims and witnesses interviewed by the mission identified the heads of the security and intelligence branches in their governorates or cities as having ordered the commission of human rights abuses , including summary executions , arbitrary arrests and torture			2
" among the steps it demands @entity4 take : " end impunity , including by abolishing legislation which grants security and intelligence personnel virtual immunity from prosecution			2
" the report called on the @entity63 to urge the @entity15 to " address in the strongest terms the killing of peaceful protesters and other civilians in @entity4 through the use of excessive force and other grave human rights violations ; to call for an immediate cessation of attacks against the civilian population ; and to consider referring the situation in @entity4 to the @entity44			1
" the @entity15 was briefed thursday on the matter by @entity108 , @entity110 @entity109 ; and a @entity2 political officer			2
@entity109 said the report concluded that " the abuses and human rights violations going on on the ground undermine the proclaimed reform package , " and that she had recommended @entity4 be referred to the @entity44 " because all the evidence produced by the commission 's report support a finding of widespread and systematic violations of human rights -- equaling crimes against humanity			1
" after the @entity15 met , representatives from @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 said they would support a resolution to heighten pressure on @entity132			2
" we believe that the time has come for the council to take further actions to step up the pressure against those who are responsible for the violence against the citizens of @entity4 , " said ambassador @entity133 , charge d'affaires of @entity126 's mission to the @entity2			1
@entity129 's representative said his country has asked for an emergency meeting monday in @entity146 , @entity147 , of the @entity148			0
he added that the draft resolution will ask for an independent inquiry into the situation by the commission			0
the session may extend into tuesday , said @entity154 , press officer at the officer of the @entity110			0
@entity156 , @entity157 deputy permanent representative to the @entity2 , said the @entity157 would support a resolution that would include sanctions against @entity4 for its crackdown on peaceful demonstrators			1
" we must again call for an immediate end to the violence , call for unhindered and sustained access for humanitarian and human rights workers and the media , and we must take collective measures against the @entity7 regime , " she said			1
@entity4 ambassador @entity170 lashed out at the charges as untrue and unfair			2
" it is really pitiful to see these influential countries in the council making use of the council as an instrument to fulfill their illegitimate strategies against my own country as well as against the whole area , " he told reporters outside the @entity15			2
@entity170 then ticked through what he said were other untruths that resulted in wars -- the 1964 @entity187 that gave then - president @entity188 authorization to send @entity157 troops to @entity191 , the 1961 @entity192 by @entity194 exiles and the alleged weapons of mass destruction that @entity157 officials proffered in 2003 as justification for the war in @entity201			1
" all the invasions that were taken on behalf of the @entity15 were based on lies , " @entity170 said			2
" since when , and under which international laws , can a member state claim that the president of this country or that country is legitimate or not ? " he asked rhetorically			0
@entity170 said that @entity7 has issued 20 reforms since march that will lead toward democracy in @entity4 by the end of the year			1
" this is , after all , what the peaceful demonstrators are calling for , " he said			0
the goal of the @entity157 is to instigate further violence in the country , he said			2
the fact - finding mission 's report came as @entity157 and @entity222 leaders called for @entity4 president @entity7 to step down			1
" the future of @entity4 must be determined by its people , but president @entity7 is standing in their way , " @entity157 president @entity223 said in a statement			1
" his calls for dialogue and reform have rung hollow while he is imprisoning , torturing and slaughtering his own people			0
... for the sake of the @entity4 people , the time has come for president @entity7 to step aside			1
" @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity129 and @entity238 leaders backed @entity223 's call , as did representatives of the @entity241			0
@entity157 authorities imposed new economic sanctions against @entity132 on thursday , freezing @entity4 government assets in the @entity157 , barring @entity157 from making new investments in @entity4 and prohibiting any @entity157 transactions relating to @entity4 petroleum products , among other things			1
@entity157 secretary of state @entity249 said the @entity157 " will take steps to mitigate any unintended effects of the sanctions on the @entity4 people			1
" @entity147 became the latest nation to recall its ambassador from @entity4			0
@entity255 and his regime have repeatedly denied allegations of violations against civilians , insisting that any military efforts have been against " armed gangs " and " terrorists			0
" @entity255 told @entity263 ban ki - moon that military operations have stopped , the @entity2 said wednesday			0
but anti-government protesters on thursday accused @entity4 forces of rounding up opposition members in the hard - hit port city of @entity269			0
security personnel clad in black raided homes in @entity269 's @entity275 district , making arrests in an ongoing military crackdown against protesters calling for @entity7 's ouster , two witnesses said			0
opposition members reported seeing security forces take up positions in and around a handful of cities			0
throughout the protests , the @entity4 government has repeatedly said it was already taking key steps toward political and social reform			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports by witnesses , the opposition groups or the government because @entity4 refuses to allow international journalists to enter the country			2
the opposition assertions are based on reports from organizers , witnesses and medical professionals , who have been speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear for their safety			0
the unrest in @entity4 , part of a wave of protests across much of the @entity309 world , began in march with mass protests following the arrest of teens for scrawling anti-government graffiti			0
the protests quickly grew into a larger movement calling for free elections and an end to the reign of @entity7 , whose alawite - minority led government rules sunni - majority @entity4			1
the @entity323 , a loose coalition of groups that documents and organizes protests , puts the number at 2,545 people who have died since the protests began			0
the vast majority were civilians , and 391 were security personnel , the group said			0
@entity0 's @entity340 , @entity335 , @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , and @entity339 contributed to this report .			0
