@entity0 -- the approaching election represents a crossroads for @entity4			1
as its citizens visit their polling stations on september 20 , they should consider the fact that the nation has quietly morphed -- under the leadership of prime minister @entity12 -- into the political equivalent of an @entity15 slave , responding more readily to the interests that motivate the @entity15 than to the concerns of @entity4			1
read more : who is @entity20 ? if the trend continues , @entity4 will not only lose its national identity to its stronger allies , it will cease to enjoy the fundamental individual rights and freedoms that seem to be evaporating elsewhere in this increasingly integrated world			1
these issues are personal to me			0
i came to @entity4 as an immigrant , but i fell quickly in love with the country and its people			2
more importantly , i saw @entity4 as a place in which my children could grow up safe in the knowledge that @entity38 society protects the interests of its own citizens above all others			2
my opposition to the @entity12 government goes beyond its abuse of surveillance powers or its leaking of confidential information to politically aligned publishers			0
read more : @entity12 apologizes to @entity20 over spying it goes beyond @entity12 's illegal conspiracy with the @entity52 to placate the @entity53 and other financiers of the @entity55 in the @entity15			1
whatever government is formed as a result of these elections will be charged with the responsibility of negotiating @entity4 's participation in the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , an ambitious 21st century trade agreement proposed and driven principally by @entity15 ' interests			1
make no mistake ; the @entity61 is only the latest attempt by the intellectual property industry in @entity15 to criminalize legitimate business activities such as file sharing , to destroy privacy and free speech , and to extend the @entity15 legal empire to the @entity72			2
read more : @entity15 vs. @entity20 it is my belief that the @entity12 government , if given the opportunity to participate in the @entity61 negotiations , will once again place the interests of @entity4 behind those of the @entity15			1
these critical issues are some of the motivating factors behind the formation of the @entity84			0
the unique relationship between the @entity87 - based perspective and issues of global technology abuse is more than mere happenstance			0
it is indigenous people throughout the world that suffer the most from the spreading mantle of intellectual property laws and elitist economic policies			0
the lack of basic access to knowledge for everyone , and the transformation of the internet into a toll booth governed by pay - as - you - play @entity15 rules , are what motivated me to identify and then consolidate the relationship with this important group			0
@entity4 is engaged in a struggle , just as i am , for internet freedom and everything beneficial that flows from it			0
the task of securing that liberty falls to this generation , as the point of no return is not far off			0
those politicians around the present government in @entity4 -- whose " @entity121 " were exposed in @entity120 's recent book -- are the last people who should be entrusted with the future of this great country			1
this election represents a chance to turn back the clock to a time when @entity4 was the sovereign manager of its own domain			2
i hope the electorate will take advantage of the opportunity â € ” it may be its last			0
