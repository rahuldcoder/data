-- entering this season @entity1 had reached the quarterfinals at every grand slam except for the @entity5			2
she memorably won @entity6 in 2011 to open her account at majors , sweeping past @entity9 in the final , and achieved semifinals at the @entity13 and @entity12 last year			1
her drought , however , in @entity14 persists after the @entity16 managed just three games in the third round against little - known @entity20 @entity19 and exited 6 - 3 6 - 0			1
the outcome was better for another @entity6 champion , @entity22 , who cruised in straight sets against @entity24			1
@entity1 has found it difficult playing in hot and humid conditions in the @entity20 in the past because she suffers from asthma and this week the lefty revealed she had been battling a virus and fever			1
following a close first set , @entity1 claimed a mere 15 points in the second			2
" my body would n't let me fight , " @entity1 told reporters			1
@entity19 , ranked at a career - best 81st , reached the fourth round at a grand slam for the first time , much to the delight of her home crowd			2
her best results previously had come on grass , advancing to the semifinals at a tour event in @entity46 , @entity47 in 2010 and 2013 -- both times as a qualifier			0
but she was in good form ahead of the meeting with @entity1 , upsetting former @entity6 semifinalist @entity52 in the first round and @entity55 @entity54 in the second			1
@entity57 almost joined her compatriot @entity19 in the fourth round , serving for the match against former world no. 1 @entity61			1
but @entity61 broke back and prevailed 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 4			0
second - seed @entity62 dropped the first set to @entity66 's @entity65 in a tiebreak before going through 6 - 7 6 - 3 6 - 2			0
@entity68 , whose four titles in 2013 place her second behind only @entity72 on the @entity74 tour , produced the most emphatic score in the women 's draw saturday when she thumped former top - 10 player @entity78 6 - 1 6 - 0 in under an hour			0
@entity78 was n't only disappointed with her performance -- she did n't like having to provide a sample to drug testers post match			0
" i just can ( laugh ) about my game today ! " @entity78 , engaged to @entity84 superstar @entity83 , began on @entity85			0
" going to the doping control , maybe i have something after a 0 - 6 ! haha sick of it ! ! ! 1000 times doping doping			0
" @entity22 lost on hard courts to the big - serving @entity24 in @entity92 two years ago but was n't broken in his 6 - 4 6 - 3 6 - 3 win saturday			2
in remaining unbeaten on hard courts in 2013 , he moved closer to a potential quarterfinal showdown with @entity96			0
@entity98 's fellow @entity97 , @entity99 , was slumping before the @entity5 but the tenacious fourth seed progressed to the fourth round after a four - set win over @entity103 of @entity104 .			1

@entity1 , the 2011 @entity6 champion , won three games in the third round
@entity1 has been suffering from a virus and said her body would n't let her " fight "
