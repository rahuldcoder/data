-- sunday night 's @entity2 telecast was enough to make you drop your knitting and stare in amazement at the contortions being performed on stage at the none - dare - call - it - @entity9 -- and not necessarily by @entity12 , whose performance was one of the evening 's weirder moments			1
was it really just a year and a day ago that the @entity2 made its big play for youth , via the double - edged disaster of @entity19 and @entity20 ? ok , that did n't work			2
but last night 's full - frontal embrace of the past -- punctuated in no small way by the choice of a silent movie as @entity27 -- was a back flip , a half - twist , and a landing in deep denial			1
it was n't the @entity2 's fault that the show 's director - elect @entity35 self - destructed , or that @entity35 's hand - picked host @entity36 bailed , or that the plucky @entity37 had to be called in to host a show he had n't done since 2004			1
it is n't @entity37 's fault that he 's 63 years old			0
but someone -- producer @entity41 , perhaps -- should answer for why a show celebrating an industry in so much trouble chose to cast itself as something so profoundly @entity46 ©			1
at a time when audiences are becoming increasingly disenchanted with the very " theatrical experience " the @entity2 spends so much time championing , why would the show 's writers and producers characterize the idea of going to the movies as something quaint , nostalgic and on the way out ? time and again , participants reflected on moviegoing as something they remembered fondly from their childhoods			1
they might have been talking about the @entity61			0
it was a strange tone to take , especially since anyone who pays any attention at all to the media -- or lives in @entity67 , or talks to other people -- knew that " @entity73 " was poised to win @entity27 , @entity70 and @entity71 ( which it did )			1
when you have an 800 - pound metaphor pending delivery , why add insult to injury ? @entity79 : the winners list it did n't help , of course , that the show was being held in the erstwhile @entity9 , which had a name change since the venerable company filed for bankruptcy			0
@entity37 never mentioned the word " @entity93 , " probably believing that it might make people in the film industry nervous that the company synonymous with film would be going out of business			1
but it was n't the issue of changing technology that gave last night 's show a stale air			1
it was the issue of unchanging taste			1
@entity37 , game as usual , opened the show with the same shtick he 's used all of the nine times he 's hosted , including the comedy montage of mock scenes from nominated movies			2
it 's never had any edge and is n't intended to , but the general tone of the comedy was bloodless , and even blinkered : delivering one gag about the advanced age of @entity118 nominees @entity119 and @entity120 , the host suggested that next year 's show would be sponsored by @entity122 ( the prostate drug )			2
this might have been funny , if 1 ) the disconnect between the @entity2 and anyone under 30 was n't so pronounced ; 2 ) @entity120 and @entity119 were n't among the classiest guys in the room ; and 3 ) they were n't that much older than a lot of other people present			2
@entity120 , showing that age is what you make of it , delivered the evening 's most eloquent acceptance speech			0
but as deserving as he was ( for " @entity136 " ) , he could n't help but point up the industry 's affection for the past , especially its own			2
share your view on the @entity2 no one can deny best actress @entity141 is almost routinely spectacular , or that she gave a marvelous performance last year , albeit in a mediocre movie ( " @entity144 " )			2
but there were several supposed sure things going into last night 's awards			1
and the only one that did n't come true was @entity151 ' selection as best actress for " the help			0
" granted , @entity141 's last win was 13 nominations ago ( 1983 , " @entity156 " )			0
but given that @entity158 took home the @entity161 award for " the help , " and got a standing ovation from the @entity2 crowd besides , it makes you wonder			0
it could be that voters thought @entity169 ' screen time was insufficient for the @entity171 prize , or that she was n't the center of the story ( @entity174 was , arguably )			0
but that 's probably giving the @entity2 more credit than it deserves			2
the fact is , @entity178 gave a much broader , comedic performance ; @entity169 ' work spoke to the real pain of racism			0
similarly , the choice for @entity184 -- " undefeated , " the weakest among a pretty feeble list of nominees -- was about a white football coach and his black high school team , the kind of " @entity191 " vehicle that @entity2 voters gravitate to			0
why ? because it makes them feel good without straining			0
for a town synonymous with left - leaning politics , @entity67 has never looked so starched and conservative			0
the idea would probably make @entity198 recoil in horror , but @entity67 's embrace of the past is rooted in the same thing as @entity205 primary voters ' embrace of reactionary candidates : a profoundly uncertain future			1
i like " @entity73 " as much as anyone ( ok , probably a little less ) , but for all its charms , it 's not a forward - looking film			1
and last night 's @entity2 was not a forward - looking show			1
it was rooted in a kind of paralysis , the kind that accompanies a deep - seated fear			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity221 .			0

" @entity73 , " a nostalgic film , won a number of @entity2
@entity221 : film industry , which is in trouble , chose to cast itself as profoundly @entity228
he says that unchanging taste gave last night 's @entity2 show a stale air
@entity221 : @entity67 's embrace of the past is rooted in fear of an uncertain future
