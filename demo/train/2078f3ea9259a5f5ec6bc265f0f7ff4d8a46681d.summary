@entity0 , @entity1 -- the security relationship between the @entity6 and @entity7 is closer than at any time since @entity8 , the head of the @entity4 said wednesday			1
gen. @entity9 was speaking at a conference here at the @entity11 , where he said @entity7 has played an " irreplaceable " role in @entity13 , and a similar role in @entity15			1
" it 's clear that , as was the case in @entity13 , the scale of the @entity7 contribution in @entity15 is such that the coalition can not succeed without you , " @entity9 told the @entity7 audience			1
the alliance between the @entity6 and @entity7 formed the " core " of the coalition in @entity13 from the beginning , he said			2
the cooperation included the @entity28 , or special forces , which were " fully integrated " into @entity6 special operations teams , @entity9 said			1
the @entity28 led in a number of the most important counterterrorism operations of the war , he said			0
now that the two countries have worked together for five years in @entity13 and eight in @entity15 , there is a generation of officers and enlisted service members " for whom coalition operations are the norm , " @entity9 said			2
he said the relationship should be formally incorporated into @entity7 and @entity6 organizations and procedures , with more combined assignments			0
" it is one thing to deploy our people to combat zones and have them adapt to coalition operations and build effective teams , which they 've shown they can do amazingly well , " he said			0
" but it 's quite another thing to move beyond the ad hoc -- to instill the coalition mindset by building partnerships and personal relationships through our training and education programs before our units deploy and then to sustain them once the deployment is over			0

@entity13 , @entity15 coalitions depend on @entity7 - @entity6 alliance , @entity4 chief says
gen. @entity9 says @entity6 - @entity7 special operations have been " fully integrated "
" @entity74 operations are the norm " for @entity6 and @entity7 personnel now , he says
