-- it 's the diplomatic equivalent of hosting both the @entity2 and the @entity3 in the same country on the same weekend			0
on saturday president @entity5 welcomes the leaders of the world 's most powerful countries to the @entity10 conference at his country retreat at @entity12 in @entity13			1
and the next day he hosts some two dozen @entity15 heads of state in @entity16			1
the challenges of this @entity18 include some complicated logistics : how do you get eight world leaders and their delegations comfortably situated in the rustic wood chalets that make up @entity12 , and which has never hosted this many heads of state before ? and the challenges , of course , also involve trying to resolve some very knotty problems : -- in a time of contracting budgets , what kinds of commitments are plausible for @entity15 countries to make to @entity33 after the alliance withdraws all its combat troops from the country in 2014 ? -- what to do about the civil war in @entity39 ? in a significant and symbolic development , @entity41 's president @entity40 has accepted @entity15 's offer to attend the @entity16 summit , according to @entity41 's ambassador to the @entity46 , @entity45			1
given that the summit 's principal focus will be the future of @entity33 , a discussion without the participation of @entity41 would have been a bit like trying to stage " @entity53 " without @entity53 appearing on stage			1
right now @entity41 is blocking the transit of critical @entity15 supplies over @entity41 roads to @entity33			1
still , the vital air corridor across @entity41 airspace into @entity33 remains open			2
@entity41 closed the ground routes in protest after @entity15 forces killed about two dozen @entity41 soldiers last november at a post on the @entity33 - @entity41 border , in what @entity15 has termed an accident			1
@entity41 's foreign minister @entity68 on monday raised the possibility of reopening those ground supply routes to @entity33 , saying their closure was " important to make a point			2
@entity41 has made a point and now we can move on			0
" in addition to an agreement on reopening the supply routes , the @entity5 administration hopes to obtain greater @entity41 involvement in peace talks with the @entity82			2
a senior administration official says that there is evidence that the " reconciliation " process with the @entity82 -- which the @entity46 has been quietly moving forward with for many months -- has split the @entity82 movement ; some elements of the @entity82 are interested in reconciliation , while others are " very upset " about this idea			0
the assassination on sunday of mullah @entity94 , a former @entity82 minister who was negotiating between the @entity33 government and @entity82 insurgents -- an attack that has been claimed by a breakaway @entity82 faction -- would seem to underline this point			0
a key issue that will be discussed in @entity16 is who will pay for the @entity33 army and police after the @entity15 drawdown			1
the expected end strength of the @entity33 national security forces will be around 350,000 by 2015 , although that is expected to fall to 230,000 by 2017			0
the costs to pay for this are estimated to run around $ 4 billion a year after 2014 , and the @entity33 government can pay only a small fraction of it			0
although the @entity5 administration " wo n't be passing the hat , " @entity46 officials expect that some @entity15 countries will announce in @entity16 commitments to pay for the @entity33 army and police post- 2014			1
at the @entity12 meeting one of the most complex problems that will be discussed is what to do about the conflict in @entity39			2
former @entity123 secretary general @entity122 reached an agreement with @entity39 president @entity125 in april that @entity125 would observe a ceasefire and pull back his soldiers from urban areas where @entity125 's forces have killed thousands			2
the senior administration official says , " we have been very skeptical about the @entity122 plan			0
we have not seen @entity125 fulfill any part of the deal			0
" at @entity12 , the administration plans to discuss measures about how to hold @entity125 accountable for his violations of the ceasefire and the human rights of his people			1
it will be a long weekend for president @entity5 and his team			0
there appear to be no good options in @entity39 and , like most @entity46 , @entity15 countries have grown very weary of the long war in @entity33			1
@entity0 's @entity148 contributed reporting to this piece .			0

new : @entity41 to attend @entity15 summit
@entity5 hosts @entity10 conference at @entity12 , then @entity15 summit in @entity16
@entity157 : the issues will be *funding* @entity33 's future and the civil war in @entity39
@entity162 : problems are how to hold @entity125 accountable and @entity15 's @entity33 fatigue
