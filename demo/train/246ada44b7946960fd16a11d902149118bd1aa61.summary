@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was enjoying a pint at his local pub in the @entity7 when he got an idea that would change his life -- and the lives of thousands of others			1
it was 1992 , and @entity14 and his brother @entity15 had just seen a news report about refugee camps in @entity19			1
the images of people suffering in the war - torn country shocked the two salmon farmers , who 'd visited there as teenagers and remembered the warmth of the @entity19 people			1
" we began saying ' would n't it be wonderful if we could just do one small thing to help ? ' " @entity29 says			0
after talking it over , the two men took a week off work and collected food , clothing , medicine and blankets			1
they loaded everything into an old @entity41 , drove to @entity19 to deliver it and returned to @entity1			1
" i came back here thinking that i did my one good deed and it would be back to work , but it [ did n't work ] out like that , " he says			2
when they arrived home , the brothers found an avalanche of goods that people had continued to donate while they were away			0
" i was touched by the overwhelming generosity of others , " @entity29 remembers			0
" i saw all of those donations in our family home and thought , ' wow , people really are good , ' and it inspired me to be good too			0
" after much thought and prayer , @entity3 quit his job , sold his home and dedicated himself to helping people in need			1
he returned to @entity19 with aid 22 more times during the @entity68 , and over the next 18 years his work expanded and evolved			1
today , his program -- @entity3 , named after the @entity71 -- provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world			1
@entity29 found his current focus in 2002 while working in @entity76 -- a country ravaged by famine and @entity79 -- when he met a local teenager who just wanted a decent meal and an education			1
" the mother of the family was dying of @entity79			0
she was lying on her bare mud floor , and she had her six children around her , " he says			0
" i started talking to her oldest child , @entity88			0
and @entity88 said , ' i 'd like to have enough food to eat			0
i 'd like to go to school one day			0
' " in response , he launched @entity3 , which strives to break the cycle of poverty by feeding children a daily meal at school			1
the food -- in most places a mug of maize - based porridge -- gives students an incentive to continue their schooling and helps them focus better on their studies			1
it 's a formula that @entity29 says is working			1
" pass rates go up dramatically in the schools where we start providing @entity3 , " he says			2
" we 've seen huge improvements in attendance rates and academic performance			0
" @entity3 partners with local residents , who handle the daily work of cooking and serving the food			1
in @entity76 -- the group 's largest effort -- more than 10,000 volunteers donate their time on a regular basis			1
the program operates in more than 500 schools and child - care facilities in 15 countries , a global effort that @entity14 coordinates from a tin shed on his parents ' property in @entity1			1
while the married father of six lives on the property , he spends most of his time abroad , overseeing the project and visiting the schools where meals are served			0
" i see the children 's faces as they eat their meal , " he says			2
" knowing i can transform their lives keeps me motivated			0
" but there are always new challenges to overcome , most recently in @entity146 , where @entity3 has operated since 2006			2
working in partnership with a local catholic priest , the group was feeding about 12,000 children a day when the earthquake hit in january			2
much of the infrastructure the program relied on in the slums of @entity155 was destroyed , so the group 's mission expanded			2
they helped create temporary classrooms and are rebuilding eight schools in the area			0
in addition to their school - based feeding program , the group now feeds about 2,000 elderly @entity146 and is providing additional food and medicine to the community			1
@entity14 is driven by his @entity169 faith , but there is no ministry aspect to his work			0
" we are very careful to never link feeding and faith , " he says			0
" we serve those who are in need ... period			0
" when i think of @entity3 i think of it as a series of lots and lots of little acts of love , " he says			2
" i 've learned ... that every small act of kindness does make a difference			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity3 websites at www.marysmeals.org and www.marysmealsusa.org and see how to help .			2

@entity192 was at a pub in 1992 when he got the idea to help *victims* in war - torn @entity19
a trip to deliver food , clothing and blankets led to a life 's work of helping others
after working in @entity76 in 2002 , @entity3 started @entity71 's meals
today , the program provides free meals to more than 400,000 children in 15 countries
