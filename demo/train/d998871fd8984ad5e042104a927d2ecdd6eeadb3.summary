@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 , whose case drew international attention , was put to death by lethal injection for the 1989 killing of an off - duty police officer in @entity11 , @entity1 , prison officials announced wednesday night			1
@entity4 was defiant to the very end			1
after he was strapped to the death gurney , he lifted his head to address the family of the slain officer			1
he told the family of @entity18 that he was not responsible for the officer 's death and did not have a gun at the time , according to execution witnesses			1
@entity4 said the case merited further investigation , talking fast as officials prepared to give him the lethal cocktail			1
the execution followed the @entity30 @entity29 's rejection of a stay , allowing the state to proceed			1
@entity4 was declared dead at 11:08 p.m. et. throughout the day , @entity4 ' lawyers and high - profile supporters had asked the state and various courts to intervene , arguing he did not murder @entity18 in 1989			1
@entity4 initially had been scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 p.m. et. but the proceeding was delayed more than three hours as the justices pondered a plea filed by his attorney			1
several hundred people , most of them opposing the proceeding , gathered outside the state prison in @entity0 where @entity4 , 42 , awaited his fate			1
others held a vigil in a nearby church			0
the inmate 's sister , @entity50 , was among those who held a vigil outside the prison			1
before the @entity30 @entity29 's decision , she said officials needed to take more time to examine the case			1
" when you are looking at someone 's life , you ca n't press rewind			0
" more than 100 officers , many in riot gear , stood guard over the largely - quiet gathering , which featured candles , occasional prayers and songs			0
at least three people who crossed the street had been taken away in handcuffs			0
" tonight the state of @entity1 legally lynched an innocent man , " @entity4 ' lawyer @entity71 said			2
" @entity74 witnessed something tragic			0
" @entity4 ' supporters , who also rallied outside the @entity29 building , argued that his conviction was based on the testimony of numerous witnesses who had recanted , including a jailhouse informer who claimed @entity4 had confessed			1
" there 's a genuine feeling among people here and across the nation that we 're about to do the unthinkable , " said @entity82 , president of the @entity83			0
but prosecutors have stood by the conviction , and every appeal -- including the last - minute petitions filed wednesday -- has failed			0
@entity4 's supporters cheered and hugged each other when news of the earlier delay reached them			1
but it did not sit well with @entity99 's mother , who remained at home			0
" this delay again is very upsetting and i think really unfair to us , because we want this situation closed , " the slain officer 's mother , @entity103 , told @entity2 's " @entity105 " earlier in the evening			0
she said the execution would bring her " relief and maybe some peace			0
" @entity4 ' attorneys started the day by asking a judge in @entity0 , where @entity1 's death row is located , to halt the proceeding , citing a new analysis they say shows ballistics testimony at his trial was " inaccurate and misleading			1
" they also note that a federal judge found in 2010 that a jailhouse informer 's testimony that @entity4 confessed to killing @entity18 was " patently false " and that prosecutors knew a key eyewitness account was wrong			1
" clearly , the fact that mr. @entity4 's death sentence rests in part on ' patently false ' and egregiously inaccurate and misleading testimony , evidence and argument renders the death sentence fundamentally unfair , unreliable and therefore violative of the @entity132 , " his attorneys argued in a motion filed wednesday morning			1
that appeal was denied wednesday afternoon			2
the state @entity29 followed suit a short time later , leading his attorneys to turn to the @entity30 @entity29 in the final hour before the execution			1
@entity4 has been scheduled to die three times before , most recently in october 2008			2
that time , the @entity30 @entity29 halted the execution two hours before it was scheduled to take place			1
this time , @entity4 declined to request the special last meal offered inmates prior to execution and was offered a standard meal tray : grilled cheeseburgers , oven - browned potatoes , baked beans , coleslaw , cookies and a grape drink			1
" he has continued to insist this is not his last meal , " said the rev. @entity149 , the senior pastor at @entity151 's @entity150			0
pope @entity154 , @entity156 anti-apartheid leader @entity155 and former president @entity157 said the execution should have been called off			0
@entity159 and the @entity160 led efforts to exonerate @entity4 , and @entity163 human rights officials joined those calls wednesday			1
" not only do we urgently appeal to the government of the @entity30 and the @entity1 to find a way to stop the scheduled execution , but we believe that serious consideration should be given to commuting the sentence , " read a joint statement from the @entity163 special rapporteurs on arbitrary executions , judicial independence and torture			1
but the man who originally prosecuted the case , @entity176 , said those who do not believe there is physical evidence in the case are wrong			0
" there are two @entity4 cases , " @entity176 said tuesday			2
" there is the legal case and the public relations case			0
we have consistently won in court , and consistently lost in the public relations battle			0
" since @entity4 ' 1991 trial , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony			2
the @entity30 @entity29 ordered a district court in @entity11 to review his claims of innocence in 2009 , but district judge @entity196 ruled the following year that the evidence did " not require the reversal of the jury 's judgment			1
" the parole board rejected a plea for clemency on tuesday			0
in @entity1 , only the board -- not the governor -- has the right to grant clemency			0
and a request that @entity4 be allowed to sit for a polygraph by his attorneys was also rejected by the state @entity211			2
@entity4 ' supporters argue he was the victim of a rush to judgment by police seeking justice for the death of one of their own , as well as widespread racial prejudice in the criminal justice system			1
@entity149 noted to @entity2 that several other inmates have been proven innocent in recent years			0
supporters argued that the original witnesses who testified against @entity4 were fearful of police and spoke under duress			1
other witnesses also have since come forward with accounts that call @entity4 ' conviction into question , according to his supporters			2
according to prosecutors , @entity4 was at a pool party in @entity11 when he shot a man , @entity234 , wounding him in the face			2
he then went to a nearby convenience store , where he pistol - whipped a homeless man , @entity237 , who 'd just bought a beer , according to accounts of the case			0
prosecutors said @entity18 rushed to the scene to help , but wound up being shot three times by @entity4			2
they said @entity4 shot the officer once in the face as he stood over him			2
a jury convicted @entity4 on two counts of aggravated assault and one count each of possessing a firearm during a crime , obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder			2
the murder charge led to the death sentence			2
@entity103 told @entity2 earlier this week that she did n't begrudge protesters their opinions			0
but she said they do n't understand the facts of the case			0
" to them the point is the death penalty			0
ninety - nine percent have absolutely no idea who @entity4 is or who @entity18 was , " she said			0
" they 're just following their belief			0
" @entity2 's @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 and @entity274 contributed to this report .			0
