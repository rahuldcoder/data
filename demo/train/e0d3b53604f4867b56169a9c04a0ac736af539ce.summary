the world will have seen nothing like it			2
it is being hailed as the holy grail for power , the biggest hydroelectric project ever built that would harness @entity9 's greatest river and light up half of the continent			1
but will the ambitious plan to tame the mighty @entity13 , a mega-project first conceived in the 1970s , finally get going and what will be its actual impact ? last month , the government of the @entity18 announced in @entity19 that the construction of the first phase of a new set of energy projects at the country 's @entity24 would begin in october 2015			1
the new $ 12 billion development , dubbed @entity27 , is expected to have a power output of nearly 4,800 megawatts ( mw ) , with @entity29 agreeing to buy half of the electricity generated			1
but the @entity18 government 's bold vision ultimately involves five further stages that would complete the " @entity27 " mega-project , giving it an astonishing capacity of 40,000 mw -- that 's twice as much as the @entity40 in @entity41 , currently the world 's largest hydro project			1
when completed , @entity27 could provide more than 500 million people with renewable energy , say its proponents			2
" a myth dreamed of for 40 years , @entity27 is becoming a reality with an action plan spread over several plants which will be added in stages , " the @entity18 government said in a statement after the @entity19 meeting			2
powerful river with a length of 4,700 kilometers , the @entity13 is @entity9 's second biggest river , after the @entity55 , and the world 's second largest river in terms of flow , after the @entity60			1
at the @entity27 site , some 1.5 million cubic feet of water flow steadily through a network of cataracts every second , dropping about 100 meters to form the world 's biggest waterfall by volume			1
yet the power potential from the river 's rapids has largely gone unexploited in a country plagued by violence and corruption for decades -- just 11.1 % of the @entity18 's population has access to electricity , according to the @entity78			0
read this : @entity9 's new skyscraper cities so far , the only two projects built to tap @entity13 's potential are two smaller dams -- @entity24 1 , commissioned in 1972 , and @entity84 , a decade later			1
both of them are almost exclusively used to provide energy for the mining companies in the southern @entity18 's copper belt but are currently undergoing extensive rehabilitation as they perform far below capacity			1
seeking funds the @entity18 government has n't yet decided on the developer of @entity27 , but three consortia from @entity41 , @entity96 and @entity98 / @entity97 are the frontrunners in the competitive selection process			2
the financing will come from both public and private sources : the @entity103 , the @entity78 , the @entity104 , the @entity105 and the @entity106 have all been named as potential contributors			0
but will the @entity18 , a country with a risky investor profile , be able to raise enough money to build the mammoth project ? some say that with $ 12 billion required just for @entity27 -- the entire project has an estimated cost of $ 80 billion -- it 's going to be an extremely tough and complex task to find the huge sums needed			1
" it almost defies imagination that this kind of money is going to be available , " says @entity116 , technical adviser to the @entity117			0
he notes that several different players will " have to come to the party with equity , " from multilaterals , commercial and national development banks to the @entity18 government and the developer of the project			0
" it is hard to imagine how all of this is going to fall into place , " says @entity116			0
" they 've started , they 've made a commitment to proceed on the basis that @entity29 will take a huge amount of the power , but getting from here to there it 's just a very long road , " he adds			0
transferring power indeed , the pledge by energy - hungry @entity29 to purchase about half of @entity27 's future power production is essential for the project to attract finance and get going			1
the two countries are currently negotiating a treaty to finalize the details of a power purchasing agreement , including the construction of transmission lines to transfer 2,500 mw of @entity27 's production to @entity29			1
the exact routing of the energy corridor is not yet defined , but it is expected to be over land , through different countries in the southern part of the continent			0
read this : ' @entity162 blowing through @entity9 ' a @entity78 spokesperson told @entity164 that such power exports could potentially raise considerable revenues for the @entity18			0
" with energy resources on this scale , @entity18 can play a pivotal role in meeting not only its future domestic energy needs for poverty reduction and economic development , but also the energy needs at regional and continental levels , " said the spokesperson			0
" with only one in 10 @entity18 households having access to electricity , development of projects like @entity27 and subsequent @entity27 is essential for growth , more jobs and improved well - being in @entity9			2
" @entity183 ? yet , not everyone agrees			0
with half of @entity27 's power traveling south , and nearly all of @entity188 and 2 's energy bypassing the @entity18 's rural communities to be consumed by the mining industry , critics say the country 's poor will see no benefits from the project			1
" all the electricity that will be generated from @entity27 is for commercial purposes and nothing is going to supply the communities , " says @entity195 of @entity196 , an ngo working against destructive riverside projects			2
" the assumption being promoted is that by developing @entity27 and exporting , or supplying the mines , will then create jobs in the mining industry and it will trickle down to the community -- but it has never worked , " adds @entity195			2
read this : ' solar sisters ' spreading light in @entity9 instead of pouring billions into mega-schemes , the group argues there are less costly and more effective solutions that can be deployed to tackle the continent 's energy poverty , especially wind , solar and micro hydropower projects			0
" they should prioritize decentralized energy and have a combination of grid and off - grid planning , " says @entity195			0
" if they really want to get electricity to the people , not only in the rural areas but as well as in the cities , they have to have another plan which is cheaper than grid development			0

@entity13 moving *ahead* with plans to build the world 's biggest hydroelectric project
when complete , @entity27 could have a *massive* capacity of 40,000 megawatts
project construction will begin in october 2015
but critics argue that the project will only serve the mining firms and not benefit the rural poor
