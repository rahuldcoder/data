-- at midnight last tuesday , two men were traveling in a black four - wheel drive through the @entity4 capital , @entity5			0
one was @entity6 , the most wanted terrorist in @entity7			2
@entity6 had survived more than a decade on the run , at least one attempt on his life , and a $ 5 million price on his head for planning the 1998 attacks on the @entity15 embassies in @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity19			1
but his luck was about to run out in the chaos of @entity5 , where the frontlines in the battle between the weak transitional government and @entity26 affiliate @entity24 shift almost weekly			1
his vehicle headed toward a government checkpoint , possibly after taking a wrong turn			0
according to several accounts it tried to speed through , setting off a firefight with police			0
@entity6 was killed , but to begin with the @entity4 security forces had no idea who he was			1
only when they discovered cell phones , a @entity7 passport , a substantial amount of cash and a laptop did they realize this was someone of significance			0
so his body -- which had been rapidly buried -- was exhumed , according to @entity4 military officials			0
a sample of his dna was sent to @entity16 , where @entity15 officials confirmed it was @entity6			1
they had taken dna samples from his wife and children some years ago			0
the other man in the vehicle may also have been a senior @entity24 figure by the name of @entity59 , according to @entity17 officials			1
@entity4 officials have not publicly announced the identity of the second man			0
@entity6 's death means that in the past six weeks three of @entity26 's most important figures have been killed , the others being @entity68 and @entity69 in @entity70			1
operationally , @entity6 was one of @entity26 's most effective figures : a bombmaker with aliases , multiple passports and disguises that enabled him to move in and out of @entity4			1
the forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from @entity7 , according to @entity4 officials			0
he is held responsible for making @entity24 's attacks more lethal in recent years , using an influx of foreign fighters and suicide bombings			1
several hundred foreign jihadists -- from @entity17 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity70 -- have made @entity24 a more effective group			1
several of the foreign jihadists have come from the @entity15 , with at least two ( one from @entity91 and one from @entity93 ) carrying out suicide bombings			2
@entity6 was also reputed to have developed ties with @entity96 , based in @entity97 across the @entity98			2
" @entity6 was certainly one of the key members of the @entity26 old guard , " says @entity99 of the @entity100 at the @entity101 in @entity102			1
that structure is " now fragmented and splintered into stand - alone operating networks that are loosely linked by association around the world , " she says			0
" the death of @entity6 and @entity59 has effectively removed the top half of the @entity26 network 's explosives expertise in the region , " says @entity99			1
@entity115 officials suspect @entity6 -- who was probably in his late 30s -- advised on the bombings of two bars in @entity119 last year , in which 79 people were killed			1
@entity24 attacked @entity115 because it had troops in @entity5 as part of the @entity7 force ( @entity125 ) protecting the transitional government			2
@entity115 soldiers help protect government ministers and the @entity129			0
ironically , the @entity119 bombings may have indirectly contributed to @entity6 's death			1
they prompted @entity115 to inject more manpower into @entity5			0
and a recent offensive by @entity4 troops backed by @entity125 firepower has pushed @entity24 out of several districts of the capital -- for now			2
@entity6 appears not to have been familiar with the latest frontlines			2
the @entity15 has had some success in tracking down @entity26 militants in @entity4 -- with special forces killing @entity142 two years ago			1
@entity142 had been involved in simultaneous attacks against @entity145 tourists in @entity17 in 2002 , involving a suicide bombing at a @entity148 hotel and an attempt to bring down an @entity145 airliner with a sam - 7 missile			2
the closest the @entity15 came to killing @entity6 appears to have been a strike early in 2007 on a coastal village close to the @entity17 border			1
he escaped , but many civilians were killed			0
but gathering useful intelligence in a country as large and anarchic as @entity4 is an uphill struggle			0
and the transitional government is invariably preoccupied with clan - driven power struggles rather than taking on @entity24			2
in recent days , a confrontation between the president and prime minister has spilled over into deadly street protests			0
last week , @entity166 chief @entity165 told the @entity15 @entity167 that " the threat from @entity24 to the @entity15 and @entity170 interests in the @entity171 and to the @entity15 homeland is significant and on the rise ... as @entity24 faces increasing international pressure , we may see the group increase its international attacks			1
" @entity6 's death may deprive @entity24 of some of its international reach			1
his ability to move in and out of @entity4 was important to the group 's ambitions to spread jihad throughout east @entity7			0
but @entity24 is well - entrenched in central and southern @entity4 , where a few dollars are enough to recruit young men with no hope of a job			0
according to intelligence sources , @entity24 's revenues include taxes levied at ports like @entity193 , cash from the @entity4 diaspora and possibly a levy on pirates ' ransoms			2
@entity99 says @entity24 " has come of age -- its young tactical leaders are possibly more potent , more technically savvy and politically astute than any of the other networks			0
" and @entity24 does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by @entity6 's death			1
two days after he was killed , @entity4 's interior minister was assassinated at his home by a female suicide bomber			0
@entity24 quickly claimed responsibility .			0

@entity6 was an *elusive* and talented bombmaker
@entity15 officials confirmed it was @entity6 through dna tests
@entity24 figure @entity59 was also killed , @entity17 officials say
expert says their deaths " removed the top half of the @entity26 network 's explosives expertise " in the region
