@entity0 -- a carpenter whose former @entity4 basement is the scene of an exhaustive search for clues about @entity8 said friday through his lawyer that he had no involvement in the 6 - year - old boy 's disappearance more than three decades ago			1
attorney @entity13 told @entity1 that @entity14 , 75 , who has not been charged with a crime , has long cooperated with authorities and plans to continue to do so			0
" mr. @entity14 has been cooperating with this investigation for over 30 years , " said @entity13			0
" he has continued to cooperate on multiple occasions			0
and i am going to assist him in cooperating to the fullest extent possible			0
" investigators recently relaunched their probe of the cold case , often described as a milestone effort that helped draw the plight of missing children into the national consciousness			0
@entity29 disappeared may 25 , 1979 , a block from his home in the city 's @entity33 neighborhood			1
it was the first time he walked to the bus stop by himself			1
authorities said both new and old information led them to @entity14 , a part - time handyman , who met @entity29 the day before he disappeared and gave him a dollar			1
@entity14 faces no charges in connection with the disappearance			1
@entity14 's daughter , @entity43 , told @entity1 affiliate @entity44 that her father had cooperated with federal agents , saying he " does n't have anything to do with it			1
" police and federal agents resumed their search of the @entity4 basement friday			0
it was interest in the carpenter that prompted authorities to bring a cadaver dog about 10 days ago to a @entity33 basement , where @entity29 apparently had encountered the carpenter , then 42 , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
the dog picked up a human scent in the basement , where the man had a workshop			1
when agents interviewed the man about his connection to the basement , the source said the carpenter blurted out , " what if the body was moved ? " @entity13 , the attorney , said he will speak to authorities about that alleged remark			1
" i do n't know that he asked that , " @entity13 told reporters			0
late thursday , authorities set up a grid in the basement and planned to rip up the concrete floor			0
they also took out part of the back wall of the basement , an unoccupied area beneath what was once a restaurant			0
the floor was " newly poured " at the time @entity92 disappeared , according to another law enforcement source			1
it was not dug up during the original investigation			0
@entity14 was picked up by the @entity96 again thursday , but is not in custody			2
he was questioned and returned to his @entity99 apartment , the source with knowledge of the investigation said			0
" we 're looking for human remains , clothing or other personal effects of @entity8 , " @entity0 police deputy commissioner @entity103 said of the current investigation			1
" it 's a very painstaking process			2
" in 2010 , manhattan district attorney @entity111 said his office decided to take another look at the decades - old mystery			2
@entity96 leads were then culled from that case file , sources said			2
the investigation garnered national headlines as authorities splashed the child 's image on the sides of milk cartons in the hopes of gathering more information , then a novel approach			1
@entity128 , president and chief executive officer of the @entity130 , said the investigation into the decades - old disappearance is " very encouraging			1
" " we think it sends a message to searching families everywhere that just because it 's been a month , or year or 10 years or even 33 years you never close the case until you learn with certainty what happened , " @entity128 told @entity1			1
@entity92 was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter , @entity143 , a convicted child molester acquainted with @entity92 's babysitter			1
a judge found @entity147 responsible for the death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million			0
he never paid the money			0
though @entity143 has been considered a key focus of the probe for years , he has never been charged in the case			0
he is serving a 20 - year sentence in a @entity156 prison for molesting another boy and is set to be released later this year			1
a source said investigators now also want to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond @entity143			0
@entity163 and @entity164 , @entity92 's parents , still live a block away from the scene and would n't comment on the new developments			2
a notice on the apartment building said , " to the hardworking and patient media people : the answer to all your questions at this time is ' no comment			2
' please stop ringing our bell and calling for interviews			2
" @entity179 , the author of " after @entity92 : the missing child case that held @entity181 , " told @entity1 that " the family 's been living through this for 33 years			1
they 've had many moments like this			0
they 've learned how to deal with it			0
" dozens of police and federal agents gathered outside the building on @entity4 's @entity192 on thursday and are expected to continue their search over the next five days			1
@entity96 special agent @entity194 said the bureau 's @entity195 is at the scene			2
" we are cautiously optimistic " that the search will be helpful , " @entity96 special agent @entity198 said			0
forensic evidence uncovered at the scene will be analyzed at the @entity96 laboratory in @entity204 , @entity205 , sources said			2
it is not clear whether authorities searched the basement in 1979 , though a source said it " figured into " the investigation			2
authorities have reason to think the new search could lead to the discovery of the boy 's remains at that location , though they remain wary after past leads in the case failed to pan out , according to two sources familiar with the probe			1
" i hope they find something , " said resident @entity223 , who says he 's lived in the neighborhood since 1976			2
@entity33 , a @entity4 neighborhood now known for its boutique shops , art galleries and loft apartments , at the time was considered a grittier locale , where abandoned storefronts dotted the city streets			0
@entity223 said he remembers the initial investigation into @entity92 's disappearance when police first knocked on his door in search of clues			1
" that 's odd , is n't it , " he said , referring to the fact that 33 years later , police are again in his neighborhood searching for the boy			1
on the day of his disappearance , @entity92 's mother , @entity164 , learned after her son failed to return home from school that he had n't been in classes that day			1
she called the school , then called the homes of all his friends			0
when she found no one who had seen her son , she called police and filed a missing person report			0
by evening , more than 100 police officers and searchers had gathered with bloodhounds			0
the search continued for weeks , but no clues to @entity92 's whereabouts were found			2
the boy 's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children			1
president @entity270 named may 25 , the day @entity92 went missing , @entity271			0
@entity1 's @entity272 contributed to this report .			0
