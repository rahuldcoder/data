@entity0 , @entity1 -- an uneasy calm returned to @entity1 's cities tuesday , a day after two @entity1 labor groups suspended their nationwide strike over the elimination of the country 's fuel subsidy			1
in suspending the strikes , the @entity10 and the @entity11 cited successes gained by demonstrators , including an announcement monday by president @entity16 slashing fuel prices			1
in @entity0 , the country 's commercial center , vehicles filled the streets tuesday but traffic was still at lower - than - normal levels			1
a heavy military presence was still evident in the city 's streets in the evening , with armed checkpoints set up at most key bridges and along major roads in the city			1
many gas stations displayed a price of 97 naira ( 60 cents ) per liter , the new price announced by the government monday			2
the protests began earlier this month after fuel that had cost about 65 naira ( 40 cents ) shot up to 141 naira ( 86 cents ) when the subsidy was removed			2
announcing the revised price monday , @entity16 cited " the hardships being suffered by @entity1			1
" and in a signal that the government has listened to public complaints about widespread corruption , the @entity40 was also tasked tuesday with investigating fraud over fuel imports and sales			0
but while the @entity10 and @entity11 urged demonstrators to go home as they suspended their industrial action , it remained unclear whether they will accept the fuel - price cut and call for a permanent end to the strikes and protests			1
a third organization , the @entity56 , issued a statement deploring the suspension and urging continued strikes and protests until the government agrees to restore gas prices to what they were before the subsidy ended			1
in another statement tuesday , the @entity56 criticized the inspector general of police , @entity67 , over his warning that any @entity1 taking part in protests would be arrested and charged , and that anyone calling for a change of government would be prosecuted for treason			2
@entity56 secretary @entity75 condemned @entity67 's statement as " uncivilized and provocative " and accused him of seeking to " repress the legitimate expression and freedom of assembly of @entity1			2
" the union said it would consult with the public over continuing the strike action			0
but there were no protesters to be seen on the streets of @entity0 tuesday , following the warning from @entity67			2
police continued to stop and shine lights into vehicles passing through the city , while soldiers equipped with armed personnel carriers were stationed by the so - called " freedom parks " where protesters had congregated			0
@entity0 state gov. @entity95 called monday for the immediate withdrawal of soldiers from the streets of @entity0 , a sign of dissent among the authorities over the handling of the protests			1
in a written statement , @entity95 said there was no development in the state that warranted such a large military deployment and the protests had been largely peaceful and lawful			0
" for me this is not a matter for the military			0
the sooner we rethink and rescind this decision the better and stronger our democracy will be , " he said , saying public discourse on political matters should be encouraged			0
" if anything , this is a most welcome transformation of our democracy in the sense that it provokes a discussion of economic policies and ... may result in political debate , " he added			0
eyewitnesses told @entity2 that police and the army were not allowing protesters into demonstration zones monday , but there were no confirmed reports of violence			0
scattered demonstrations began in @entity1 after @entity16 announced on january 1 that the government would end the popular fuel subsidy , which was widely seen by citizens as one of the few perks of living in the oil - rich but largely impoverished nation of more than 160 million people			1
the government has said the removal of subsidies would free up billions of dollars to boost the economy and improve the country 's infrastructure			0
but there is a widespread lack of trust that the government would provide the infrastructure			0
the subsidy 's removal caused the price of fuel and other goods to spike and became a rallying point for @entity1 angry over corruption and the alleged misuse of oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty			1
@entity1 , the world 's eighth - largest crude oil exporter , is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world .			0
