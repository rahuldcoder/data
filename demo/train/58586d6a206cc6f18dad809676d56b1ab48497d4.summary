-- this year 's @entity2 cocoa harvest , which has just gotten underway , is looking bright			2
warm weather is leading many to expect a bumper crop for the main harvest			0
but a number of problems in the @entity9 , the world 's largest producer of cocoa beans , are casting a cloud over the longer - term supply outlook and leading to increasing volatility in cocoa prices , experts say			1
for years , the @entity9 , which accounts for 35 percent of the world 's supply of cocoa , the main ingredient in chocolate , has been the lifeblood of international chocolate manufacturers			1
according to the @entity24 , the @entity9 , officially known as @entity9 , produced 1.2 million tons of cocoa in 2009 - 2010			1
its annual output is nearly double that of its closest rival , @entity28			0
but in recent years , the @entity2 nation has been struggling with production growth as a host of challenges -- from political strife to disease -- have threatened supplies			1
" all analysts are looking into what 's going on in the country , " @entity36 , senior statistician at the @entity24 , told @entity0			2
" if you know what 's happening in @entity9 , you already have a rough idea of the global situation			1
" the last 10 years have seen cocoa crops in the @entity9 flat - line , while consumers ' insatiable appetite for chocolate has increased			1
( in three of the past four years , world cocoa supply has failed to keep up with demand			1
the exception was in 2008 - 2009 , when the economic downturn curbed demand			0
) farmers in the @entity9 are still struggling with political instability			1
the country was split in two following a civil war in 2002 -- the south is controlled by the government while rebels control the north			0
according to @entity63 , president of the @entity64 , this has delayed much needed reinvestment in the sector			0
" one of the major reasons for declining yields on farms is the number of aging trees , " he said , adding that there are n't enough supplies , such as fertilizers , available to farmers			2
there are also problems with pests and diseases , namely black pod , a fast spreading fungal disease that causes cocoa pods to blacken and rot			0
a third of the global cocoa crop is lost to diseases annually			2
limited access to credit , as well as a shift among @entity9 farmers away from cocoa to more reliable crops such as rubber , or to jobs in the city , are additional challenges facing production , industry watchers say			1
doubts about the @entity9 's cocoa production have led to increasingly volatile cocoa prices			1
" if there 's a bad cropping season , if there 's an insect pest or fungal disease that goes through the @entity9 , that can impact the whole market , " @entity63 said			2
recently , the market has attracted speculators who , betting that prices will rise , buy up cocoa stocks and store them to sell later			0
in a headline - generating move , @entity116 based hedge fund @entity114 took delivery of 240,100 tons of cocoa in july			2
that order accounted for around 7 percent of annual global production and caused cocoa prices to rise to their highest level in more than 30 years			1
the upward trend in cocoa prices has affected consumers , to a degree			0
in the past two to three years , most chocolate companies have increased their prices , " @entity129 from the @entity24 said			2
but , he added , the chocolate sector is quite competitive so firms have been looking for ways to avoid passing on rising input costs to their customers			0
" companies do n't want to lose market share , so there are some who have reduced the size of their chocolate portions to limit the price increase			0
some have also changed their chocolate recipes , using less cocoa			0
" @entity36 does n't expect any substantial increase in chocolate prices in the near term			0
" this year and the next few , we do n't need to be concerned that our chocolate bars will increase in price , " he said			0
but he warned , further down the line there are key concerns supplies will not meet demand -- a problem the industry is trying to address by diversifying its supply away from the @entity9 and other @entity2 nations and into countries such as @entity161 and @entity162 .			1

the @entity9 is the world 's top supplier of cocoa , producing 35 percent of global supplies
after increased cocoa production in the *1990s* , production has flat - lined in the past 10 years
political instability has delayed investment in the @entity9 's cocoa industry
other challenges *include* lack of credit and a shift among @entity9 farmers away from cocoa to more reliable crops
