-- with more than half the world 's population living in cities , there 's never been a more important time to consider sustainability			0
@entity7 has been at the forefront of this since establishing the " @entity11 " vision			2
if cities are to thrive , we ca n't continue to allow accidental growth			0
a clear plan supported by residents , workers , businesses , visitors and backed by strong political leadership is what we need			0
in @entity7 , this has been our warmest winter in 150 years with the average daily temperature rarely dropping below 68 degrees @entity24 ( 20 degrees @entity23 )			2
last summer we had our hottest day on record , hitting 114.8 degrees @entity26 ( 46 degrees @entity23 )			0
looking forward , we are bracing for another scorching summer of heat waves , drought and fire			0
the @entity30 ( @entity31 ) has set some ambitious targets by aiming to cut 70 percent of our carbon emissions by 2030 ( on 2006 levels of 5.4 million tonnes per annum )			1
we 've looked into a number of clean tech solutions over the years , many of which we 're already putting into place			0
this includes installing @entity42 's biggest program of building - mounted solar panels -- with 5,500 solar panels on 30 buildings			1
not only have we rolled out @entity47 streetlights that emit half the carbon , but we 've also retrofitted 45 council owned properties to reduce energy , water and waste			1
to go green , cos are working to increase the urban canopy by 50 percent by 2030			2
this includes planting 8,900 trees since 2005			0
with a warming of two degrees - and projections show we are headed for a four to six degree change -- we risk catastrophic climate change			1
while @entity7 is moving towards a more sustainable future , climate change demands we do more			1
last week a study released by the @entity64 found the cost of moving @entity42 to 100 percent clean energy would be roughly equal to sticking with coal			2
that 's one of the reasons we 're working on plans for local and clean energy			2
gas - fired trigeneration - a technology that uses heat from energy production making it more than twice as efficient as coal power stations -- is one of the tools we 're using to end our reliance on coal - fired power and generate 30 percent of our energy needs from clean , renewable sources			0
as far as transport goes , cities like @entity85 and @entity86 have experienced a cycling boom and despite the nay - sayers , @entity7 has also seen a 113 percent increase in cycling since 2010			1
but to give residents an efficient transport option that gets them out of their cars , we are completing a 125 - mile cycling network			0
as @entity7 becomes a greener and better connected place , our long term " @entity97 " plan is designed to make sure the city works for everyone , now and in the future			1
to make that happen we 'll need to make bold decisions and test new ideas and that 's exactly what we 're doing in @entity7 .			1

*combating* climate change is at the heart of " @entity97 " , says @entity7 's mayor .
from investing in solar panels to @entity47 street lights , @entity7 is *exploring* ways to cut energy .
the city also set some ambitious targets to cut 70 percent of carbon emissions by 2030 .
