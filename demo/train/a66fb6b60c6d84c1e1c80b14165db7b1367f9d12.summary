passing laws is one thing ; enforcing them is another			0
enter @entity4 's idling rule , meant to improve the city 's air quality by prohibiting drivers from running their engines when they 're not moving			1
toxic tailpipe fumes have been shown to increase rates of asthma and put children at risk of developmental delays , environmental studies show			1
when cars and buses line up outside of schools , all those idling engines can worsen the quality of air both inside and outside the school , as children and parents come and go			1
by putting air - quality monitors in backpacks on pregnant mothers in @entity4 , researchers at the @entity26 have shown that fetuses exposed to greater pollution in the womb are more likely to experience developmental delays as children			2
for years , @entity4 drivers have had three minutes to turn off idling engines , and in 2009 the city passed more stringent laws : drivers now have one minute to turn off their engines if they 're adjacent to a school			1
but environmental advocates complain the laws do little to improve air quality because the legislation in place is only minimally enforced			0
the city issues about 10 million parking tickets each year but only a few thousand idling tickets			1
if the traffic enforcement agents were properly citing drivers who violated the rule , the number of idling tickets would be significantly higher , say advocates , because violation of the rule is so widespread			1
a 2008 @entity59 oversight committee report said as much , too , stating : " although idling restrictions have been in place in @entity4 since 1971 , many drivers persist in idling their engines , leading to questions about the effectiveness of our idling law			1
" on display a year later , at a press conference announcing the tougher idling rules around schools , were environmental and health advocates on the one hand celebrating a legislative win , but on the other hand still concerned about a lack of enforcement follow - through			2
" we are therefore urging you , mayor @entity80 , to direct @entity84 's traffic enforcement agents to finally enforce the anti-idling laws , " said @entity77 , an attorney for the @entity78 , at the 2009 press conference with mayor @entity80			0
" consistent enforcement is the only way that @entity4 will finally get the message that unnecessary curbside idling is no longer tolerated in our city			1
" the mayor , while reiterating environmental values , pointed to the difficulties of marshaling systemic enforcement during a recession			0
" the real challenge here is that in the good times everybody is in favor of environmental stuff , and when the times get tougher , it 's probably the first thing to be jettisoned , " @entity80 said			0
" it 's just incumbent on those of us that want to leave a good life for our children , and want to have clean air for us to breathe , and clean water to drink , and this is not just for the future , it 's for the present as well , it 's incumbent on us to really carry the fight			2
" @entity116 's full coverage : @entity117 but little has changed in three years , advocates say			0
the issue of enforcement arose again at a december press conference with @entity80			0
" well , i will take a look at it and see			0
we 'd like to enforce it more , " @entity80 said			0
" keep in mind , enforcement costs money ; the people that enforce have plenty of other things to do			0
( the ) police department 's first job is going to be worrying about more serious things			0
" but it would be easy to enforce the law properly , advocates said , because agents enforcing parking rules could also crack down on idling			2
" the traffic enforcement agents are ideally suited to give the idling tickets because they are already walking up and down the street looking for parking violations			1
in addition , the @entity147 ' health is negatively impacted by illegal idling , " said the @entity78 's @entity77			0
" the @entity147 have had authority to give idling tickets since september 2009 , and yet they have only given , on average , one ticket per agent per year			1
consistent and rigorous idling enforcement is the only way to let drivers know that illegal idling is no longer tolerated for health reasons in @entity4			1
" the mayor 's office issued no comment to @entity116 regarding enforcement but confirmed that 2,989 tickets were issued for idling in fiscal year 2011			2
after passing tougher idling rules , the city initiated a public awareness campaign through @entity167 to inform drivers and parents of the health dangers , and economic waste , of engine idling			2
" children 's asthma symptoms increase as a result of vehicle exhaust , " says one @entity4 @entity174 flier			1
" idling for longer than 10 seconds wastes more fuel than restarting your engine			2
" see a list of idling rules nationwide			0
