at 9:45 in the morning after his 40th birthday you might expect @entity3 , best known for co-founding @entity4 , to be a little bleary			1
after all , many millionaire tech execs flaunt their party lifestyle like a badge of honor			0
but on this tuesday , in a quiet corner of an @entity12 hotel lounge , @entity3 is clear - eyed , animated and apparently hangover - free			1
for the first time in years he 's back at the @entity15 conference , where @entity4 first and famously blew up in 2007			1
@entity3 's got a book coming out next month , " things a @entity19 , " which he describes as " packed with aspirational lessons that were learned through embarrassing mistakes			1
" and he 's recently launched his newest venture , a mobile tool called @entity22			1
part social app , part visual search engine , @entity22 lets users mine their social networks for answers to such questions as , " what kind of plant is this ? " or " how do i hook up this tv ? " @entity22 is unusual in that instead of computer algorithms like @entity35 's , it relies on human knowledge to help users find the answers they seek			1
and each question must be accompanied with an image , creating a sort of visual shorthand			0
users can even draw over the images with their finger			0
despite its lofty pedigree -- its investors include @entity48 and @entity49 -- jelly has baffled some tech pundits who do n't understand why people would use it when they can just poll their friends directly through @entity54 or @entity4			1
but @entity3 , who also helped launch @entity55 , remains optimistic that @entity22 will catch on			1
the serial entrepreneur sat down with @entity57 at @entity15 for a chat about @entity22 , social networking and why seeing @entity4 hashtags sometimes seems " surreal			1
" here 's a condensed version of our conversation : on bringing @entity4 to @entity15 : " @entity4 exploded here			1
it was a watershed moment for @entity4 , and it was an eye - opening moment for me			1
so for the most part after that year i never came back , because i did n't want to jinx it			0
" when we came to @entity15 in 2007 it was the first time we could really see @entity4 being used in the wild			1
there was a concentration of people , and most of them were using it			0
and i saw that @entity4 was far more powerful than i realized			1
" the one example that comes to mind is ... there was this guy in a pub. and he said ( on @entity4 ) , ' this place is too loud for us to talk			1
let 's go to this other place			2
' and he named it in his tweet			0
and in the eight minutes it took him to walk over there , it had filled to capacity and there was a line out the door			0
@entity4 took a bunch of loose individuals , and suddenly they became one organism , like a flock of birds			1
" and i could n't think of another technology that allowed human beings to flock in real time			0
we went back ( to @entity106 ) , and a few days later we formed the company			0
" on the idea behind @entity22 : " we 've become the most connected humanity that 's ever existed			1
we 're now connected to anyone else on the planet within four degrees of separation because of social networks and mobile phones			1
it 's an amazing era of connectedness			2
and yet not a lot of people stop to think , ' why ? what 's the true promise of a connected society ? ' " i 've been asking myself that question ever since i left @entity4			1
and it occurred to me the true promise of a connected society is people helping one other			2
or at least it should be			0
" so @entity22 is a search engine , as audacious as it sounds			1
everyone figures we 've got search all wrapped up			1
there 's the @entity132 -- it 's vast and growing , and we can search it in a fraction of second to find anything we want			1
but the @entity132 is only the @entity132 ... it 's only a collection of documents			2
there 's way more to life than the @entity132			2
so @entity22 is like a search engine for everything else			1
and the reason it works is that we 're all connected			2
" people talk about artificial intelligence			0
well , how about ( human ) intelligence ? we have 7 billion people on this planet			0
" on why @entity22 requires images : " we 're carrying around 8 - megapixel cameras ( on our phones )			0
in a world where 140 characters is considered a maximum length , a photo really is worth 1,000 words			0
for almost any question , a photo can deepen the context			0
also , it allows you to type less : ' should i buy a @entity166 ? ' how about just , ' should i buy this ( with a picture of a @entity166 ) ? " " a lot of people ask , ' why not just ask my social network ? ' but what @entity22 does is blend @entity4 and @entity54 together			1
jelly gives you far more reach			2
your friend 's wife 's lawyer is all of a sudden answering your question			2
on how people have been using @entity22 : " whenever you build something , the creativity in humanity comes out			1
i love it when i 'm seeing answers to questions where people are only drawing on the photo			0
they 're not even using language			0
somebody asked , ' how do you do a screenshot on a @entity194 ? ' and all the person ( answering ) did was circle the three keys you touch			0
" i have this theory that if something is n't fun and goofy , then you wo n't use it on a regular basis			0
and then you wo n't think to use it when you need it			0
the same thing happened with @entity4			1
" on the future of social networking : " social networking is still brand new			2
we 're still figuring it out -- how much we should share , and how much we should self - edit			0
" but i think the bigger thing here is that it 's growing so huge			2
you can now measure the number of people on @entity214 who use social networking ... ( as a large percentage ) of the planet			2
and that opens up intense possibilities of cooperation among humankind			0
" in the future , what do i think will happen ? i think we 'll be able to accomplish in one year what used to take 100 years			0
because when people get together and coordinate , they can do amazing things			0
on his early days at @entity15 : " i used to come to @entity15 in the early 2000s every year , and we 'd put on a party for @entity55			1
it ( @entity15 ) always falls on my birthday			2
so i used to pretend it was my birthday party , because we got @entity35 money to throw around and give everyone free whiskey and beer			0
and we 'd give out blogger t - shirts , which of course had a b logo , like for @entity3			2
and i 'd say , ' welcome to my birthday party ! free whiskey for everyone ! ' " on the success of @entity4 , which he left in 2011 : " it 's incredibly weird to see , everywhere i look , the little birdie that i drew			1
or hashtags on my favorite tv shows			0
for me personally ... that 's surreal			2
most importantly , it means that people are finding value in the service			0
" and that 's the most important thing you can do in this world before you die -- to build something of value			0
