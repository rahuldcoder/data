@entity0 -- only two days after @entity3 was officially inaugurated , the @entity2 enthroned its new leader , ex-oil executive @entity4			1
as archbishop of @entity6 , @entity4 now heads the 77 million - strong worldwide @entity7			1
@entity9 prime minister @entity8 , prince @entity10 and the @entity11 , bishops and leaders of other faiths were among those gathered for the ceremony at historic @entity17 , about 100 kilometers ( 60 miles ) southeast of @entity0			0
it followed a series of time - honored traditions , beginning with the admittance of the new archbishop of @entity6 into the cathedral following three knocks with his staff on the door			2
@entity4 then swore an oath of faith to the @entity2 and @entity30 on the ancient @entity31 , brought to @entity2 by @entity32 in 597			2
but the service also embraced elements that were modern and reflected the church 's international reach			0
a woman , @entity37 , the @entity38 of @entity6 , installed @entity4 in his role as @entity40 of the @entity41			2
and the cathedral rang with @entity44 music and dance , reflecting @entity4 's link to the continent through his work in peace and reconciliation there , and improvised organ music			2
in his sermon , @entity4 said that " @entity60 - liberated courage " had allowed great changes to take place in the past -- such as bringing an end to slavery			1
further courage is now needed to tackle issues including the environment , the economy , global poverty and human development , he said			2
he also reflected on how @entity3 , in his own inaugural homily on tuesday , had called for people " in humility and simplicity " to protect each other and the world			0
thursday 's service makes @entity4 the 105th holder of the most senior position in the @entity2 and the titular leader of the world 's 77 million @entity77			1
he was named as the successor to dr. @entity80 as @entity41 in november			0
he was the bishop of @entity81 , @entity2 , at the time			0
he is considered an outspoken critic of the excesses of capitalism and a supporter of women bishops , as well as an opponent of same - sex marriage			1
same - sex marriage ahead of the service , the question of same - sex marriage jumped to the fore when an interview @entity4 gave to the @entity95 reignited the debate over the church 's approach to issues of sexuality			1
@entity4 acknowledged the strength of some same - sex partnerships , saying , " you see gay relationships that are just stunning in the quality of the relationship			1
" nonetheless , he reaffirmed his support for the @entity2 's policy of opposition to same - sex marriage			1
" the @entity2 holds very firmly , and continues to hold , to the view that marriage is a lifelong union of one man to one woman , " he told the @entity9 public service broadcaster			0
" at the same time , at the heart of our understanding of what it is to be human is the essential dignity of the human being			0
and so we have to be very clear about homophobia			0
" @entity4 said it was not about " turning a blind eye " to same - sex relationships but rather " loving people as they are and where they are			1
" his remarks come a day after it emerged that @entity3 , now head of the world 's 1.2 billion @entity132 , may privately have voiced support for civil unions in his native @entity136 while publicly opposing same - sex marriage			1
gay rights activist @entity138 -- a self - described devout @entity139 and former theology professor at a @entity139 seminary -- said the then - archbishop of @entity143 had called him after he wrote an angry letter to @entity139 leaders			0
" he told me ... ' i 'm in favor of gay rights and in any case , i also favor civil unions for homosexuals , but i believe that @entity136 is not yet ready for a gay marriage law , ' " said @entity138			0
@entity136 approved a law legalizing same - sex marriage nationwide in july 2010			1
a bill that would legalize same - sex marriage is currently under consideration in the @entity157			1
@entity8 has incurred the wrath of many in his @entity160 by backing the legislation			0
educated at @entity162 , @entity4 worked for oil companies in @entity164 and @entity0 before training for the ministry			0
he had only been a bishop for a year before his promotion to the top job was announced			0
in his public appearances , he has displayed a wry humor and down - to - earth attitude that may help him negotiate the minefield of conflicting views and interests within the vast @entity7 .			2
