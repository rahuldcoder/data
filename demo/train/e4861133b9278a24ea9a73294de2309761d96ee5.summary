-- a tangle of dresses , skirts , jeans , suits , shirts and a @entity8 costume greeted @entity9 when she opened her closet each morning			1
it was overwhelming and made her feel like she had nothing to wear			1
after submitting a photo of her overstuffed closet to @entity17 , the closet guru helped @entity9 to throw out most of her clothes			1
" i 'm amazed at how little is in my closet right now , and it would have scared me two months ago , " @entity9 said			1
" but once you start , you 'll find yourself getting rid of stuff that in a million years you never thought you 'd get rid of			0
" that is exactly what @entity24 wants people to experience			0
her new book , " i have nothing to wear ! " , co-authored with @entity30 , provides a 12 - step program for women to clear the clutter from their closets so they can dress better			1
" i feel like you should always look like you 're about to run into your ex-boyfriend , " @entity24 said			0
" when you can avoid it , you should never be a mess			0
" the book 's title is a phrase every woman can relate to , standing in front of their closets when the contents resemble a mass of fabric without any discernible outfit choices			1
the recovery process outlined in @entity24 's book , like any other 12 - step program , is designed to be taken seriously			1
" when you look in your closet and the morning and everything is organized in a way that fits your life , it 's just nice and easy , almost like you have a uniform , " @entity24 said			1
@entity24 demonstrated the process during a segment taped in @entity9 's home for @entity60 's " @entity59			1
" unlike reality shows where the fashion - impaired victim watches as while a stranger rips through their closet , @entity24 's wardrobe system encourages conducting your own closet cleanse with a trusted friend who will become your sponsor			1
they need to be the kind of friend who will honestly tell you what looks good or bad and knows what you wear most often			1
the book stresses you should minimize your closet by keeping only the very best items			1
start three piles of items : those you want to keep , those you will donate / throw away and a pile for maybes			0
anything with too much wear , holes or stains needs to go straight into the trash			2
it usually takes three times to sift through the mounds of shoes , stacks of jeans and endless hangers of impulse - bought outfits before a stress - free close appears			0
each time , you 'll enter your closet with a new mission			2
in the first round , you remove damaged items and in the second round , toss out the items that do n't suit your style			0
during the third round , you try on everything left in your closet to determine whether it 's a good fit			1
@entity24 and @entity30 believe this process provides a confidence boost and stress relief			0
" people think that fashion is this very superficial part of your life , but it really has deep psychological roots , " @entity24 said			2
" if you do n't feel your best , it 's going to affect your mood all day			2
" @entity24 's own sponsor is @entity30 , her co-author , and the pair went through all three rounds of clearing together			2
@entity24 's impossible - to - walk - in designer shoes had to go and the perfect white button - down blouse stayed			2
a @entity130 dress also got the boot while a pair of amazing jeans were given a place of honor			0
many impulse buys cluttering your own closet probably first appeared in a daydream scenario			2
" you 'll walk into a store and see a sequin dress , " @entity24 said			0
" you think , ' when i 'm invited by that random guy to a black tie affair , i 'll wear that dress			2
' that 's how we all buy things , we envision wearing them to certain events			1
how many times do you buy something and that story does n't happen ? " @entity152 , a style consultant who comes from a family of well - maintained closets , has helped many women with the closet cleanse			1
the biggest problem women have with their closets is the subtracting			0
stuffing it with clothes is the easy part , but sifting out the old can feel as stressful as living with it			0
" clothing is very emotional for women , " said @entity166 of @entity168 blog			0
" the first step is detaching yourself from emotion and understanding it is just clothing			0
it 's got to have value , in that it does something for you			2
" @entity166 recommends going through your closet twice a year to maintain an organized wardrobe			2
" even though they have fewer things in their closet , they feel like they have more to wear , " she said			1
" women need to be better editors			0
buy something you love that fits you right and blends into your wardrobe			0
" @entity9 feels like a new person after going through her closet cleanse			1
besides an organized space for her clothing , it has changed her shopping habits			0
she now faces potentially deal - breaking questions before she takes anything to the cash register : how often will i wear it , do i really love this and does it fit well ? she 's also cut back on online shopping because of the uncertainty pertaining to fit , color and appearance			1
@entity24 and @entity166 both believe that just because you 're cleaning out the closet does n't mean tossing out your sentimental things			1
@entity24 will never get rid of the t - shirt her father used to paint his college dorm room or her grandmother 's bracelet			0
@entity166 will always keep the ugly sweater passed down from her great - grandmother			0
however , you wo n't see @entity24 or @entity166 wearing these items outside of their homes , either			0
but your dye - to - match prom shoes or the ill - fitting dress you 've never worn ? those can go to goodwill or a consignment shop			0
" be ready to say , ' i 'm going to make my life simple and i 'm going to respect the fact that i should only have the best things that i could possibly have in my wardrobe , ' " @entity24 said .			1

cleaning out your closet can also clean up your life
