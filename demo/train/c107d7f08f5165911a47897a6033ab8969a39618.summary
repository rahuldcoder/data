-- the @entity2 government is getting its bill for the damage a @entity6 minesweeper did to a @entity8 coral reef , and it 's less than expected			1
@entity8 officials say the @entity11 damaged 2,346 square meters ( 25,252 square feet ) of @entity12 after it ran aground january 17			1
that 's down from the original estimate of about 4,000 square meters ( 43,000 square feet )			0
and that means , under @entity8 law , the @entity2 owes $ 1.5 million in fines , the @entity18 said in a posting on the @entity21 website monday			0
the fines are based on the amount of reef that has been damaged , the state - run @entity22 reported			0
the @entity27 board said the revised damage estimate was made by a team of @entity6 and @entity8 marine biologists from wednesday to friday			2
the original survey was conducted january 27 while the warship was still on the reef			2
the @entity11 was completely removed on march 30 , when the ship 's stern , the last of four sections into which its 224 - foot - long hull had been cut , was lifted from the reef by a massive seagoing crane			1
" using aerial imaging , the grounding zone was originally outlined using the ship 's length as the basis for computing the total damaged area			1
this image was later observed to be obliquely angled thus artificially expanding the area plotted on mapping software , " the statement on the park 's website said			0
the cost of the salvage operation to remove the ship from the reef was $ 45 million , @entity55 reported monday , citing a @entity2 @entity57 spokesman			0
an investigation into the grounding is ongoing , but last week the @entity6 relieved the commanding officer and three members of the minesweeper 's crew of their duties based on initial results of the probe , a @entity6 statement said			1
" the initial investigation findings clearly indicate that the @entity69 , lt. cmdr			0
@entity71 ; the executive officer ( @entity73 ) / navigator , lt. @entity75 ; the assistant navigator ; and the officer of the deck at the time of the grounding did not adhere to standard @entity6 navigation procedures , " the @entity6 statement said			2
" the @entity6 has the highest accountability standards , and all four sailors were relieved by rear adm. @entity83 due to their role in the grounding and a loss of confidence			2
" @entity88 is a @entity89 that is home to about 500 species of fish and 350 species of coral as well as whales , dolphins , sharks , turtles and breeding seabirds			0
