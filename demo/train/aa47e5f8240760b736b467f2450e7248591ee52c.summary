-- did @entity1 choose wisely with her final rose ? at the very least she chose geographically , as the @entity4 - based former assistant district attorney selected former baseball player @entity5 , who also lives in her city			1
no long - distance romance for this pair , but plenty of speculation about whether their engagement will actually result in a marriage			0
left holding his heart in his hand was @entity18 - based businessman @entity17 , who was dumped in a very nontraditional " @entity20 " way			1
instead of waiting for the final rose ceremony , @entity1 went to his room and broke the news to him			1
" honestly , the last date , i wanted to just have fun and relax , and hard as i tried i could n't do that with you			0
... with you i overanalyze everything , " @entity1 told him			1
" a life with you would be overanalyzing every single moment			0
" that left @entity5 to receive the final rose after a few minutes of " suspense			2
" but the real drama came during the live " after the @entity44 " show , in which @entity39 questioned @entity1 's decision in light of some of the moments fans did n't see on camera			1
" if you were n't in love with me , " he said , " i 'm just not sure why you made love to me			0
" thus went another " @entity20 " unspoken " tradition " in that much can be hinted at -- but contestants are never , ever to spill the sexual beans			0
@entity17 kept it classy on social media , tweeting about @entity1 and @entity5 , " congratulations to @ @entity57 and @ jmurbulldog on their engagement			1
wishing you both incredible happiness			0
" despite the sighs heard round the world by @entity39 fans , there is speculation that the next " bachelor " will be fan favorite @entity68 farmer @entity67 , who won many in the audience over with his sweetness and good looks			2
what do you think ? @entity76 and @entity5 meant to be ? will they go the distance ?			2

@entity1 had to choose between @entity5 and @entity17
she broke one 's heart before the actual ceremony
there is speculation about the next " bachelor "
