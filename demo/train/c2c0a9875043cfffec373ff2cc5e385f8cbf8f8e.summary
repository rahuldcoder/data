@entity0 -- house speaker @entity2 said president @entity3 could get " burned " if he uses executive action to help undocumented immigrants			1
there are a good number of immigration activists who feel burned that he has n't done it already			1
while they were pleased to hear @entity3 renew his vow wednesday that despite @entity14 ' takeover of the @entity15 he still intends to use his executive authority to help fix the nation 's broken immigration system , the message from immigrants ' rights groups to the @entity22 remains the same : they 'll believe it when they see it			1
advocates of immigration reform want the president to provide deportation relief to millions of undocumented immigrants since @entity32 has so far failed to pass a comprehensive overhaul of immigration laws			1
it is hard to believe that a new @entity14 @entity15 and emboldened @entity14 majority in the @entity22 are likely to pass a bill that would pass muster with immigration activists			1
that leaves @entity3 and his promised executive action as immigration activists ' only hope			1
they hope he 'll keep his word			2
after promising on june 30 to announce the so - called executive actions he would take by summer 's end , the @entity22 delayed the move until after the mid-term election			1
activists say they are tired of waiting and are planning a series of rallies , marches , conferences and other events to urge the president not to allow politics to delay action			2
" details matter and promises have been made before , " said @entity61 , managing director for immigrants ' rights group @entity64			2
" our campaign to protect our communities will continue until the policy is changed in a way that includes our parents , families and neighbors			0
" at risk is not just the president 's standing with the @entity79 community			0
activists say this is an issue for all @entity82 -- including potential 2016 candidates -- who some believe have taken @entity79 voters for granted			1
in a november poll by @entity89 , two - thirds of @entity79 voters said immigration was either the most important or one of the most important issues driving their vote this year and 60 percent of @entity79 registered voters who were not planning to vote said the delay in executive action made them less enthusiastic about the president and the @entity82			1
an october survey by @entity98 found that 55 percent of @entity79 registered voters disapproved of the way the @entity3 administration has handled the issue of deportations			1
" the president 's legacy is at stake , " said @entity103 , executive director of the @entity104			2
@entity79 members of @entity32 who support reform point to the 2 million people deported during the @entity3 administration as they make their case for swift , expansive action			1
the president -- who has frequently been called the " @entity115 in chief " by immigrant groups -- used a @entity118 gala in september to repeat his promise to act before year 's end			1
he again reiterated that promise at a post election press conference on wednesday , just moments after incoming senate majority leader @entity121 warned that doing so would poison the well with the new @entity14 controlled @entity32			1
still , some advocates are skeptical			2
" there is nothing until there is something , " said @entity126 , the lead organizer of the @entity129 's ( @entity130 ) # @entity128 campaign against deportations			0
" we 're not going to stop the pressure until we see the president follow through			0
" and at least one former top @entity3 adviser urged the president to hold off on executive action in exchange for an up or down vote in the @entity22			1
" @entity146 should agree to shelve exec order for up or down vote in @entity22 , " @entity144 said on @entity145 on thursday			1
immigrant groups say " go big " several advocates who have been part of discussions with the administration , believe the president will use the @entity155 ( @entity155 ) program he announced in 2012 as a model for future action			2
@entity155 allows immigrants brought here illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation and apply for work permits if they meet certain criteria			0
the president could expand this relief to potentially millions more people			0
many supporters want the president to " go big " with a move that would include everyone who would have been allowed to stay in the @entity172 under the bill the @entity15 passed in june 2013			2
that would mean an estimated 6 million to 9 million people could qualify			0
" what they actually announce and who they decide to protect is not entirely clear at the moment , but what is clear is that the expectations are high , " said @entity176 , a spokesperson for the advocacy group @entity177			0
advocates taking action activists are planning to protest in front of the @entity22 on friday to drive that point home			1
" it 's just the beginning , " said @entity190 , president of @entity192 group @entity191 in @entity155 and co-chair of the national @entity194 ( @entity195 ) , at a press conference with other activists on thursday , adding that more events are planned around @entity199 , including a hunger strike			2
immigrant rights groups have been slowly ramping up pressure on the president			1
the friday before @entity206 , some two dozen united we dream activists hailing from as far south as @entity209 and as far north as @entity210 descended on the intersection opposite the @entity22			1
for half an hour they sat on the pavement amidst a cacophony of honking horns holding giant pictures of loved ones in danger of being deported			0
some marched in circles chanting : no justice , @entity221			0
members of the same group interrupted the president repeatedly during a campaign stop in @entity226 , @entity227 days later -- including one who was wearing a t - shirt that said " @entity230 " -- and heckled potential presidential candidate - in - waiting @entity232 at a campaign rally in @entity192 earlier in the week			0
rep. @entity235 , @entity236 , long an outspoken advocate for executive action , has already set up a " @entity239 " website with advice to help prepare undocumented immigrants for the president 's announcement			0
it includes suggestions for the types of documentation immigrants can begin gathering to prove they qualify , once a plan is announced			0
the @entity251 ( @entity251 ) held a rally in @entity253 wednesday with community based organizations and labor unions to urge action now that the election is over			0
the group will host an immigration conference next month			0
" our hope is always that by @entity199 , people would sit around the dinner table giving thanks for the administrative relief -- and that by @entity267 we will have no more separated families , " said @entity251 's executive director @entity261			2
@entity130 is planning a demonstration next week outside the @entity270 by people directly affected by deportations			0
the groups ' plans go beyond pressuring the president			0
they also want to use rallies as well as @entity145 and @entity278 to make a case to the @entity172 public that bringing the undocumented out of the shadows is good for the economy and say it 's also important to deliver that message to @entity32 , since only lawmakers can find a permanent solution to the broken immigration system			0
" the best way to get that legislative outcome is for the president to put a marker down and let the @entity14 respond , " said @entity289 ­ a , the president and ceo of the @entity292			2
" if they disagree , let them put their best foot forward on immigration reform and let 's see what they will do			0

immigrant rights activists say they hope @entity3 will act despite @entity14 @entity15 takeover
@entity3 has said he plans to issue an executive order on immigration
advocates will protest at the @entity22 friday
