@entity0 -- they are a formidable new force in the tech world -- tween developers with world - class coding skills and firsthand insights into the games kids really want to play			1
at the forefront of this wave of young developing talent are a couple of entrepreneurial @entity15 boys who have emerged from the @entity16 , a volunteer movement to teach kids computer programming			1
since the first @entity16 started up in @entity20 , @entity15 two years ago , the free , not - for - profit coding clubs have spread to 180 locations in 22 countries			1
@entity24 was hailed as the world 's youngest app developer in 2011 when , as a 12 - year - old , he released his app " @entity33 " -- a game where a pizza tries to eliminate salami slices from a kitchen			1
he created the game as a class project at a @entity16 , less than two months after he started learning to code			1
it became an instant and unexpected hit , shooting to the top of the @entity41 / @entity15 @entity40 chart , overtaking giants like @entity43 on the way and also performing well in the @entity45 and @entity46			1
" @entity33 was an experiment really , " @entity24 said			0
" i did n't want it to be successful , i just wanted to put an app up			0
" the secret of the game 's success ? " it 's pizza and it 's a robot , " he ventures			1
" maybe because it was kind of based on @entity58 , people felt they could relate to it			0
" opinion : teach @entity45 kids to write code while he admits coding " is not for everyone , " it felt like a natural fit for @entity24 , even though it was not a talent that had been strongly fostered at home			1
before he started at @entity16 , his parents would only allow him 20 minutes of screen time a week			1
" that 's computers , @entity74 and @entity75 put together , " he says			2
" after i went to @entity16 one of the mentors took my mum aside and said , ' you 've really got to let him have more time on the computer			1
' " that extra time is now paying dividends , as @entity24 has followed up his hit game with a sequel called " @entity87 ( ing ) s , " and a new game -- " @entity86 ! " -- about a quest to stop a rogue killer robot			2

@entity96 , 20 , had run a computer club at his own school , and saw a huge demand for more resources to teach computer programming skills to young people			1
after leaving high school , with @entity98 as an angel investor , @entity96 launched @entity16 , in which volunteers donate their time to teach code to 10 - 14 year olds			1
about 10,000 children have participated in the program			0
read / watch : @entity114 , @entity115 : kids , learn to code @entity118 , a young software developer who also released an app game , " @entity121 , " at the age of 12 , is another @entity16 success story			1
now aged 13 , he has spoken at conferences in @entity124 , @entity125 , and @entity126 , while his company , @entity127 , has released an online multiplayer virtual world game called " @entity130 , " and another called " @entity131 " to mark @entity132 in @entity133			2
@entity118 had already begun playing with code before he joined @entity16 , and played a role in having a branch set up in his town			1
" i think the best aspect of @entity16 is the collaboration and social aspect , " @entity118 says			1
" most people when they think of programmers think of people in their room alone , curtains down ... now , thanks to @entity16 , people see it just like any other club			1

" it 's a generational thing			2
they 've grown up with this stuff around them , so it 's quite instinctive , " he says			2
they also had an edge in terms of an instinctive understanding of what appealed to their age group			0
" i think their biggest strength is their age			0
it 's like they 're covert agents among their peers			2
" coding had the potential to empower young people , he says , particularly in struggling economies such as @entity15 where unemployment is approaching 15 %			1
" there are still vacancies in tech though -- people ca n't get enough developers and technical talent , " he said			0
on a personal level , the clubs played an important role in helping to give young people confidence , a peer group of like - minded kids , and a sense of identity			1
" when i was young , coding was my thing -- i was n't into the academic thing or the sporting thing , " said @entity96			2
" it was always a passion			0
it was n't to do it to get a job , or make the new @entity205 -- it was to have fun , to build apps and games			0
" but from an early age , he had an appreciation of the ways in which coding could have a more serious impact as well			0
when he was 14 , he came to the aid of his neighbor 's nephew who had been diagnosed with a tumor behind his eye			0
doctors in the @entity45 needed to see a scan within a day but the inferior broadband quality of the time would n't allow for the scan to be sent			0
@entity96 stepped up by swiftly putting together a software app that allowed the doctors to view the scan over the @entity227 , allowing them to make a correct diagnosis and treatment plan and saving the child 's life			0

" myself , i did quite poorly in maths in school			0
but in the context of coding it makes sense			0
it 's more based around logic than it is around arithmetic			0
" the trick is to make lessons fun and relevant			0
" instead of making a website for the sake of it , you should be making a website for the local football club			0
" the open source , workshop culture of the @entity16 adds to its appeal by encouraging students to quickly become mentors themselves			2
" if someone learns or creates something new , " says 14 - year - old @entity24 , " it 's really easy for them to teach other people and share that thing			2
" in this way , the first generation of @entity16 prodigies like @entity24 are already working to inspire the next			2
" i 've taught quite a few people @entity268 app and web development , and i really enjoy doing that			0

developers as young as 12 are having success developing game apps
many prodigious developers come out of the @entity16 , a free coding club for kids
started in @entity15 two years ago , the *non-profit* has since spread to 22 countries
two entrepreneurial @entity15 boys are the club 's most high - profile success stories
