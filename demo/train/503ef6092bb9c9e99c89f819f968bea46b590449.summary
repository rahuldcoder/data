-- if you want a snapshot of the challenges facing newspapers , you should have been with me at the exhibition area at the @entity8 gathering in @entity9 , @entity10 , a few days ago			2
the @entity11 had set up a booth , with hundreds of other companies , and a woman was hawking print and digital subscriptions			2
a man shuffled by and she made her pitch : you must read the @entity11 , how about subscribe ? the man shrugged and said no thanks , but admitted he did read @entity11 stories online			2
the woman pressed on , a bit sharper : wait , you read the @entity11 but wo n't pay ? you know how good it is			2
the man did not slow his pace ; he said he read the @entity11 ' stories not at @entity29 or on a @entity11 app , but on the @entity31 and other aggregators			0
the look on the woman 's face was one of disgust			0
the @entity11 umbrellas and others goodies for those who did sign just lay there			0
to its credit , the @entity11 is having success with its digital subscription model -- total digital subs are up over a year ago and the @entity47 even saw a bump in newspaper subscriptions because of the way it had bundled its digital offer			1
the newspaper industry is declining faster than any other industry in the @entity55 , according to a report released last week from the @entity57			1
the best papers in the country are bleeding red ; skilled editors , reporters , photographers and ad people are being let go to balance the books and please creditors			1
so what ? well , as millions of people grow suspicious of government on one side , or @entity71 on the other , the news media is about the only place left that can consistently hold institutions accountable			1
you do n't have a news business without people to gather it			1
as the paper side collapses it 's taking the news side with it			1
what happened ? the loss of classifieds to the @entity90 , an investment community that played these institutions like poker chips and left choking debt in the wake , owners without an honest commitment to independent news in a democratic society , and newspapers themselves that were slow as readers flocked to the @entity87			1
i grew up reading the @entity97 and @entity98 and as an adult had a front row seat as papers and print publications struggled with all things digital : platforms , technology , audience trends and revenue			1
newspapers need to succeed in five broad areas if they have a hope of saving the news : first , newspapers are losing their connection to enough readers to stay in business			1
papers did not keep up as attention spans shifted and younger readers failed to develop a news reading habit			1
@entity121 's new ceo @entity120 told an industry group last week that no one under 30 has read a paper , and they never will			1
the noble and necessary work of covering , investigating and following stories goes on , but papers are slow to meet readers where they live			1
the commuter - friendly tabloid became a habit for generations of readers			1
it was the right format for readers crammed onto buses and subways			1
the lesson : convenience is one key to connection and news habits			1
authenticity is another factor ( ask a @entity146 )			0
as a young reporter i grabbed the @entity149 first because its voice captured the street sense of the city in a way that the excellent @entity154 never truly could			0
second , newspapers do a rotten job explaining why they matter			0
yes , they make the case every day in what they cover			0
but they need to share what they do , how they do it , why they do it , and show the difference they make			0
the @entity173 , in its investigation of appallingly negligent hospital care two years ago , showed how to explain the process to readers			2
papers also need to explain why professional newsrooms exist plus carve out a space for readers to have a meaningful role			1
the website @entity183 has conducted groundbreaking investigations by relying on and trusting its readers			2
the site , and others , show that crowd sourcing works			0
there is a role for bloggers , readers and social media if it is done smartly			2
next , the move to mobile			0
from phones to tablets , this is the most exciting development of a new medium since the @entity87 itself			1
it is n't just that newspapers need apps or a presence on these devices , it 's what they should be doing with them			0
far beyond repurposing news , this is a whole new chance to engage readers , curate the best coverage and display and explain news in new ways			1
i saw some compelling examples at @entity8 that give me hope			0
the business side of the newspaper business remains a mess			2
ad revenue continues leaking from the print side , and the digital side is taking a long , slow time to make up the difference			0
the days are long gone when all content can be locked behind a pay wall , as much as some wish			0
that does n't mean news has to be free even if it is freely available			2
licensing of content still makes sense			0
limited pay wall models , like @entity235 ' , clearly show promise			0
finally , the biggest barrier to newspapers ' future is that guy who walked by @entity11 table and shrugged			0
the problem is us , the reader			0
public media , my profession , asks listeners and viewers to pay part of the cost			2
some do ; at least in large enough volumes to keep it going and ( pretty much ) healthy			0
i 'm not suggesting this will work for newspapers ; but we need people like you and me to value the news we read anywhere and also accept that we have to pick up the tab			1
the stakes are much bigger than a free umbrella			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity266 .			1

study shows newspaper industry is declining faster than any other @entity55 industry
@entity266 blames loss of ads to @entity90 , greedy investment firms , diluted news commitment
he says papers need to connect to readers , be authentic , be creative on @entity87 , platforms
readers need to realize , he says , they must pick up part of the tab for their news
