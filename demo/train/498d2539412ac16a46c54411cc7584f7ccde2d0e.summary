, has an offscreen history so fraught with drama it trumps anything in the movie			2
the tale of a ferociously precocious and high - strung @entity13 @entity12 girl , @entity11 ( @entity14 ) , who witnesses a tragic bus accident , the film was shot at the end of 2005			2
but @entity1 , contractually obligated to deliver a two - hour movie , fell in love with his three - hour version ( so did @entity22 , who is said to have called it a '' masterpiece '' ) , and he refused to cut it			1
' the @entity26 ' series premiere : it made me hungry , but will it make you watch ? six years and several lawsuits later , @entity31 is releasing a two - and - a - half - hour version of @entity1 's film , which has been on the shelf so long that @entity14 still looks like a teenager , @entity36 ( as her geometry teacher ) is still skinny , and at one point someone imitates @entity39			1
' @entity41 ' premiere review : lighter than air , but not bubble - headed ? so was " @entity4 " worth the wait ? @entity1 's dialogue can sweep you up in a whoosh of personality and ideas , but it 's hard to see what , apart from ego , convinced him that this story was so epic			1
@entity11 fixates on the accident because she was flirting with the driver ( @entity53 ) when he ran a red light and killed a pedestrian			0
first she lies about what happened , then she changes her story in a fit of guilt and rage			0
she makes the accident about her , which is why she must learn that it was n't			0
the trouble is , it 's a lesson we grasp all too early on			0
" @entity4 " may be the longest film ever made about the moral education of a selfish , annoying princess			1
