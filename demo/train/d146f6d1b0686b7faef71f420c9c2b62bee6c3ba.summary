rescue workers are trying to find eight people still missing from the @entity4 plane that crashed into a river in @entity6 on wednesday , amid concerns that some of them might have been swept away by currents			1
thirty - five people have been confirmed dead from the crash of @entity13 , and 15 people survived , many of them with injuries , according to @entity6 's official news agency , @entity16			1
two people on the ground were also hurt			2
searchers continued to recover bodies of victims friday , @entity16 reported , citing @entity6 's @entity22			1
pieces of wreckage from the @entity26 twin - engine turboprop aircraft have been hauled out of the @entity27 in @entity28 , the @entity6 capital			1
rescuers fear those people still unaccounted for may have drifted downstream toward the larger @entity31			1
divers have put up a net about 5 kilometers ( 3 miles ) from the crash site to try to catch the missing bodies , authorities said			1
@entity6 's president @entity39 visited the injured in the hospital on thursday and also went to a funeral parlor to express his condolences , his office said			1
some of the survivors have begun to give their accounts of the disaster in which the aircraft veered out of control shortly after taking off en route to @entity50 , a group of islands near the coast of the @entity55 province of @entity56 , then clipped a bridge before plunging into the river			0
and a recording from the cockpit of the plane captured someone making a mayday call because of an engine problem shortly before the crash			1
@entity66 , a 72 - year - old survivor , told @entity1 affiliate @entity67 from his hospital bed that he sensed something was amiss soon after takeoff			1
" i thought something 's wrong with the engine because i always take this flight , " he said			1
" there was a girl beside me , and i told her to quickly release her safety belt , hold on tight to the chair in front , and cover her head with clothes , " @entity66 told the broadcaster			0
" it was not long after i told her this that the plane went down			2
" after the crash , he said , he helped pull several people out of the submerged wreckage , injuring himself in the process			1
the plane 's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have been recovered and their contents downloaded , said @entity94 , the managing director of @entity6 's @entity95			1
investigators are analyzing the data from the so - called black boxes and may release key parts of the information friday , @entity94 said			0
but the full analysis is expected to take months			0
in the meantime , bits and pieces of information have come out that shed light on the aircraft 's final moments			2
they include a male voice on a recording of radio conversations between air traffic control and @entity115 who says , " @entity13			0
" the recording was verified by liveatc.net , which records air traffic control feeds around the world			0
it is unclear whether the man was a pilot			0
the plane 's cockpit crew were among those confirmed dead , authorities said			1
a pilot who once flew atrs for @entity131 said it looked like the plane was gliding when dash - cam video from several angles captured the moments of the crash			1
@entity138 pointed to the position of the nose , slightly down , and the wings , level			0
" as it gets closer to the highway , there 's a change in the pitch attitude ( position of the plane ) and it appears the aircraft ( left ) wing stalls , or loses lift			1
that 's what causes the dramatic turn to the left , " @entity152 told @entity1 's " @entity157 with @entity158			2
" " it 's what causes the aircraft to come down more forcefully and crash			1
" the plane was 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) from the airport , @entity152 said , at a point where the pilots should have been able to continue with the flight even if one engine failed			1
the distance indicated to him that the engine problem occurred well after takeoff			2
" it appears that it could have had a single - engine flameout , it could have had a dual - engine flameout , " he said			2
" those are things we 're going to learn			0
" the left propeller was also set to a position for flight , rather than to a position for an inoperable engine , he said			2
that could have caused drag and prompted the left wing to stall , @entity1 aviation analyst @entity182 said			0
pilots normally before a flight will turn on a system that automatically adjusts the position of the propellers , the experts said			0
a dash - cam video captured the moment the plane hurtled out of control above the city 's @entity196 before crashing into the river , just after 11 a.m. local time ( 10 p.m. et )			1

@entity206 said that after reading a report on @entity13 's route , he was grateful to the plane 's captain , who he said made efforts until the last moment to reduce casualties and damage			1
@entity216 said the situation could have been worse if the plane had crashed on the highway or hit nearby high - voltage electricity lines , according to a statement from the city government			2
" he did his best , " @entity216 was quoted as saying			0
@entity6 's @entity22 said it had ordered local airlines to carry out inspections on all their @entity226 before they can fly again			1
the special checks will look at various aspects of the engine system , including fuel and propeller control			2
@entity4 has to inspect 10 planes , while another carrier , @entity233 , has to examine 12 aircraft , according to the agency			2
the plane that crashed was less than a year old and had last completed a safety check on january 26 , it said			2
president @entity39 said the government must " think things through and make improvements			0
" " the government must strengthen aviation safety in the country and not let the same thing happen again , " the statement from his office said			0
hours after the crash , @entity4 ceo @entity247 extended a " deep apology to the victims and our crew			2
" he said 31 of the passengers aboard the flight were @entity55 tourists , including three children			0
