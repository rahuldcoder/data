@entity0 -- history shows that second terms in the @entity4 can be much tougher than first ones , and that is proving true so far for president @entity7			1
less than five months in , @entity7 and his administration appear knocked off balance by a barrage of controversies and criticisms exacerbating the bitter political battles that marked his first four years in office			1
he 's under fire from the right and left , accused by some of conspiratorial machinations to grab even more power than the leader of the free world legally holds			2
headlines are dominated by scandals such as the @entity25 targeting of conservative groups and classified leaks that disclosed details of the vast data mining and surveillance apparatus created after the 2001 terrorist attacks			2
meanwhile , @entity32 and some @entity33 say his attorney general should resign over various issues including secret subpoenas of journalist phone records			0
conservative democrat : @entity39 should think about quitting now , late night comedians are making the controversies a staple of opening monologues , and even the first lady got heckled -- at a @entity33 fundraiser , no less			2
while the issue was gay rights , the incident showed how @entity7 supporters also were frustrated by what they consider to be a lack of sufficient progress on progressive issues they expect the president to champion			1
@entity1 exclusive video : first lady confronts heckler second - term blues second - term blues have been the norm for presidents in recent decades , with @entity64 facing the @entity65 in the 1980s and @entity66 getting impeached over the @entity68 affair in the 1990s			1
to columnist and @entity1 contributor @entity72 , the latest @entity0 scandals " have put the president off balance , " with the administration on defense instead of driving the agenda			2
" the choice will be in how the administration tries to deal with it , " @entity72 said			0
" if it 's in denial and acts like these events are occurring outside its purview or control , that will be a big problem			0
" @entity7 finds himself mired in topics and disputes far from his second - term agenda , in part because he maintained some of the national security policies of his predecessor that were adopted in a nation traumatized by 9/11 , noted @entity1 senior political analyst @entity98			1
" this is a president now who 's dealing with issues he never thought he was going to have to deal with , " @entity98 said monday , referring to drone strikes , government surveillance and classified leaks			1
" but when you continue some of the policies of @entity108 , you 're going to have some of the same questions that are raised about them			0
" how should @entity7 respond ? @entity72 and @entity98 agreed that @entity7 must be proactive in dealing with the newly revealed details about how the government has access to phone records and internet activity as tools in fighting terrorism			1
last week 's leak of classified documents on the @entity121 intelligence programs forced @entity7 to try to reassure the nation by declaring " nobody is listening to your telephone calls			1
" however , the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor 's claim of a " false choice " between civil liberties and national security following the 2001 @entity134 attacks now argued that such a choice was inevitable			2
" you ca n't have 100 % security and also then have 100 % privacy and zero inconvenience , " @entity7 said			1
" we 're going to have to make some choices as a society			0
" 12 moments in national security for @entity7 's team @entity98 said @entity7 now needs to bolster his administration 's explanation so far -- that @entity149 and federal judges have sufficient oversight to prevent abuses of the information available			1
" i think he ought to get out there , speak with the @entity121 public , say not only why this kind of surveillance is defensible , but why he thinks it is essential in a post- 9/11 world and lay it out there for the @entity121 people within the strictures of what he can say given the classified nature of the program , " she said			2
@entity1 chief national correspondent @entity168 noted that despite @entity7 's insistence his administration struck a proper balance between national security and domestic surveillance , critics from ranging from libertarian @entity32 sen. @entity175 of @entity176 to liberal @entity33 sens. @entity177 of @entity178 and @entity179 of @entity180 are calling for more details and debate			1
" if the president does n't try to get ahead of it , guess what , he 'll get dragged along with it , " @entity168 said			2
other issues on the table on tuesday , the @entity189 said it filed a constitutional challenge to the @entity192 program that collected information on phone calls , arguing it violated first amendment rights to free speech and association as well as @entity199 rights to privacy			1
the controversies come as the administration and @entity149 wrestle with other volatile issues , including a bipartisan push for immigration reform and a debate over whether to arm @entity208 rebels			2
@entity72 and @entity168 agreed that @entity7 needs to move forward on issues where progress can occur , and both cited the @entity213 immigration bill that would offer a path to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the @entity121			1
conservative @entity32 fiercely oppose the measure , but more mainstream @entity32 legislators consider it vital to the party 's hopes of building support among the nation 's fastest - growing demographic -- the @entity226 vote			0
in last year 's presidential election , exit polls showed @entity7 trounced @entity32 nominee @entity229 among @entity226 voters			1
" the fact that immigration reform looks possible is significant , " @entity72 said , saying passage of a bill would be a " significant legacy accomplishment " for @entity7 and also a boost for @entity149 at a time of extremely low public approval ratings			1
republicans led by sen. @entity240 of @entity241 consider the immigration measure drafted by a bipartisan @entity245 " little more than amnesty for undocumented immigrants			0
they demand stricter border enforcement provisions before providing legal status of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally			0
despite such opposition , the @entity213 voted tuesday to open debate on the measure , with many @entity32 foes joining democrats on the procedural move			0
however , conservative sen. @entity256 of @entity257 predicted that while the measure would pass the @entity213 , it had no chance of winning approval from the @entity32 - led @entity4 unless the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants was removed			0
meanwhile , the @entity7 administration is looking at possible options this week to increase support to @entity208 rebels after resisting persistent calls for months to provide weapons			1
" there is a recognition that unless we provide help , a lot of help , the situation is going to be very , very terrible , " one senior administration official said			0
the official described a " somber mood " among @entity208 hands throughout the administration , who remain frustrated at inaction by the @entity7 administration in the face of a deterioration on the ground in @entity208 and spillover to neighboring states like @entity288			1
@entity32 scrutinizes @entity291 @entity32 are quick to seize on any foreign policy objection with the @entity7 administration as an opening to attack former secretary of state @entity294 , who is considered the leading possible @entity33 presidential contender in 2016			1
in the @entity4 , the @entity296 has demanded more information on erroneous talking points by the administration four days after the terrorist attack last september on a diplomatic outpost in @entity302 , @entity303 , that killed four @entity121 , including ambassador @entity304			0
rep. @entity305 of @entity306 , the panel 's @entity32 chairman , also is a leading critic of attorney general @entity39 over the botched " @entity310 " gun walking program and other issues			0
@entity39 now faces further scrutiny over the @entity291 's secret subpoenas of phone records for @entity315 journalists last year as part of an investigation of a classified leak			0
he has told legislators he recused himself from that case and never would prosecute a journalist for doing investigative reporting			0
@entity32 question if @entity39 lied to @entity149 when he told a congressional hearing last month that he had no knowledge of any possible prosecution of journalists linked to classified leaks			0
@entity72 said the various issues provide grist for @entity7 critics now , but the major factor in determining public opinion on a presidency will be the economy , which is moving in the right direction for the @entity4			2
" teflon presidents are @entity341 in part because of the economy , " he said , rejecting accusations by some conservatives that @entity7 's troubles amount to scandals that could lead to impeachment			1
" the impulse to simply throw out @entity346 narratives as a poster boy for the second - term curse is silly , " @entity72 added			0
" this ai n't @entity350 and calls for impeachment reflect hyperpartisan wishes rather than reality			0
" maybe not impeachment , but certainly fodder for television comedians			0
for example , @entity356 joked that for his daughter @entity359 's birthday , @entity7 gave her @entity361 's phone records			2
@entity1 's @entity362 and @entity363 contributed to this report .			0
