-- yes it 's a dive hotel , but not that kind of dive hotel			2
an @entity5 spa complex has just opened a swimming pool certified by the @entity7 as the world 's deepest			1
named the @entity10 , the pool is now the star attraction at the @entity12 , located in the @entity14 resort area , near @entity15			2
this is n't the kind of facility aimed at jaded business travelers hoping to cram in a few laps before they head upstairs to order room service			2
deep @entity22 features a shaft that plunges down ... and down ... and down until it hits a depth of 42 meters ( 138 feet ) , a space that could easily accommodate a 13 - story building			1
designed by architect @entity29 and a year in the making , @entity28 is expected to attract scuba enthusiasts and freedivers -- aquatic athletes whose incredible lung control allows them to spend minutes at depth on a single breath			1
thermal springs the pool is filled with 4.3 million liters ( 1.1 million gallons ) of thermal water from local springs , allowing divers to plunge without the skin suits they 'd need in open seas or lakes			0
it also contains underwater caves aimed at training scuba divers to negotiate sub-aquatic landscapes			0
there 's also a suspended transparent viewing tunnel that allows spectators to watch the divers in action			0
deep @entity22 was inaugurated earlier this year at a ceremony in which @entity5 world freediving champions @entity55 and @entity57 ( who dressed like a mermaid for the occasion ) plumbed its depths			1
the pool 's creators hope it will transform @entity14 into an international diving center and raise the profile of what is said to be @entity68 's largest area of thermal springs			1
it 'll also be open to beginners who want to experience its depths under supervision			0
just do n't drop your locker key			0
