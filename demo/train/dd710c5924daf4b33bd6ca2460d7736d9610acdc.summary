-- @entity1 gave you @entity3			2
now @entity4 is countering with @entity5			0
@entity4 teamed up with @entity6 this week to unveil the @entity7 , an ambitious smartphone they hope will make a run at the @entity10 while serving up @entity11 , a new version of @entity4 's @entity13 mobile operating system			1
released wednesday in the wake of the @entity16 's big splash , the @entity7 is the first phone designed specifically to run @entity13 4.0			1
it 's scheduled to go on sale in november , although pricing has n't been announced			0
in @entity4 fashion , the phone 's software has its own tasty - treat nickname			1
and while @entity4 keeps maintaining that all phone makers get equal access to its @entity13 releases , it 's clear that the company has a special place in its heart for the @entity7 , and possibly even hopes of a flagship phone to challenge the crowd from @entity33			1
" @entity7 is n't just a smartphone -- it 's beyond smart , " @entity35 vice president @entity34 wrote on the company 's blog			2
" @entity11 gives you complete control over the amount of mobile data you use by helping you better understand and manage it			0
" one of the new system 's fanciest features , shown off at an unveiling wednesday in @entity47 , is face unlock			0
thanks to facial recognition software , the feature lets users unlock the phone by showing it their face instead of tapping out a password			0
( it 's worth noting that , in awkward fashion , it took two or three tries to get face unlock to work during a demo at the @entity47 event			0
until that happens in the real world , we 'll give them the same opening - day pass that @entity69 got for @entity10 connection glitches )			0
it also has what 's being called @entity73 , an app that lets users share contacts , apps , websites and other data between two @entity13 phones by simply holding them near each other			1
and while there 's nothing as sexy as @entity86 , the @entity16 's voice - activated " personal assistant , " the phone does feature " voice typing , " which allows users to speak to create text messages , e-mails and the like			0
the @entity7 features a big , 4.65 - inch display screen ( the new @entity16 's is 3.5 inches ) , 32 gb of storage and a dual - core 1.24 ghz processor			1
it has a 5 - megapixel camera , which is on par with the @entity10 but lags behind the @entity16 's 8 - megapixel version			2
@entity4 and @entity6 counter with claims of zero shutter lag ( a frequent @entity10 complaint ) , autofocus and panoramic photo capabilities			1
early response to the phone , and the operating system , has been positive			2
" while hardware junkies like myself may have spent the past few weeks drooling over the @entity7 , the onstage demo of @entity111 proves that the software powering the device is just as impressive , " @entity107 wrote for @entity108			0
@entity4 says that @entity11 is the first operating system optimized for both smartphones and tablets			1
they say it has dramatically improved the touchscreen keyboard , made notifications more interactive and created resizable widgets , among other upgrades			0
all of which is well and good , of course			0
but the question remains : is this the phone to go head - to - head with the market 's 800 - pound gorilla , the @entity10 ? the @entity13 system as a whole has come on like gangbusters			1
phones running the system make up about 43 % of the multibillion - dollar smartphone market , compared with the @entity10 's 18 %			1
but that 's spread out over dozens of phones from multiple manufacturers and ranges from top - of - the - line offerings to cheap , slapped - together handhelds			0
@entity4 basically takes bids each year for a manufacturer to make its @entity7 phone			1
that 's after the company 's attempt to produce its own , the @entity141 , fizzled and died in remarkably short order			0
no single @entity13 phone has captured the public 's imagination like the @entity10 , a fact that @entity4 would love to change			1
" @entity11 could provide the critical push in the race to catch @entity1 , " @entity149 , an analyst at @entity150 , who is based in @entity47 , told @entity151			2
" @entity1 's software is still on the cutting edge			2

@entity4 , @entity6 unveil @entity7 phone and @entity13 4.0 , or " @entity11 "
the new @entity7 phone has a big , 4.65 - inch screen and is first to run new system
new @entity13 operating system is designed for both smartphones and tablets
@entity13 phones *dominate* market , but no single phone has rivaled @entity1 's @entity10
