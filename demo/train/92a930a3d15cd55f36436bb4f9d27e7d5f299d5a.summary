@entity9 international @entity5 , 31 , missed the match after picking up an infection in his right ankle , having only recently recovered from a groin injury which has restricted the midfielder to just four @entity16 appearances this season			1

@entity5 has an infection in his ankle , " @entity1 , 60 , told a press conference			1

we will be more accurate next week than what we can be now			0
" @entity1 , who also managed the @entity36 club between 1985 and 1991 , praised the injured duo , while also expressing his delight at seeing his charges pick up three points without two of the team 's most influential players			1
