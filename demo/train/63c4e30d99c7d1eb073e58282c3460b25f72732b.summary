@entity0 -- @entity3 's underground nuclear test site , @entity2 , is set amid terrain appropriate for its purpose : the mountainous , northeastern province of @entity7 , which borders @entity8 and @entity9 , is one of the most inhospitable winter landscapes in @entity12			1
but this grim , forbidding province , which is also home to the notorious @entity15 labor camp , seized the attention of the wider world half a century before @entity19 's nuclear tests and claims of human rights abuses made headlines			1
@entity7 witnessed arguably the most harrowing battle fought by @entity25 or @entity26 troops since @entity27 , a forgotten epic that offers every ingredient for the perfect war movie : an embattled force , towering odds , murderous combat and treacherous weather			1
yet 60 years after the @entity34 ended , and with the number of surviving veterans rapidly dwindling , the dramatic story of what took place at @entity38 has so far eluded the silver screen			1
" it 's an amazing story , " said @entity42 , a former @entity43 , @entity45 veteran and independent film producer			2
" it 's unbelievable what they did , from both a military and a human standpoint			2
" in november 1950 , a @entity54 force -- including @entity43 , @entity56 units and @entity58 commandos -- deployed around the strategic @entity38 , a frozen , man - made lake high in the @entity7 mountains that supplied hydroelectric power to the industrial cities on the coastal plain			1
they were preparing for what they believed would be the @entity34 's final offensive			2
the @entity67 teetered on the brink of defeat ; men expected to be " home for @entity72			2
" what they did not know was that @entity8 , in a brilliant feat of mass infiltration , had intervened to support its @entity3 ally , then led by @entity77 , late grandfather of current leader @entity78			1
as a @entity9 cold front descended over the highlands , the 30,000 - strong @entity54 force found itself surrounded by eight @entity8 divisions with an estimated 80,000 men			1
around 65 miles from the sea , in temperatures of minus 37 degrees @entity89 ( minus 34 degrees @entity90 ) and winds of 60 knots , the @entity26 and @entity25 troops ' only hope of escaping annihilation was to hack their way through massed enemy in a fighting withdrawal			1
combat and cold claimed a gruesome toll : of the 15,000 @entity25 troops involved , more than 3,000 died during the 17 - day struggle			1
but the @entity8 forces paid a much greater price forcing the allied troops from their positions -- some 60,000 replacements were required to replace men lost to firepower and cold			1
the fight remains seared into veterans ' memories			2
" six decades later , it 's still vivid , " said @entity110 , a retired @entity25 marine			2
" the biggest part of the battle in my mind was not being able to evacuate our wounded ; if they could n't walk to keep warm , it meant almost certain death			1
" it was a brutal campaign featuring a range of near - unbelievable events			2
an @entity124 force battled 9 - 1 odds in an ambush in " @entity127			2
" a marine company somehow held off a @entity8 division for five nights at a strategic pass			1
@entity8 soldiers blew up a bridge over a 4,000 feet deep valley , forcing the @entity25 to carry out an unprecedented operation : the airdropping of a replacement bridge			1
@entity138 , a marine fighter - bomber pilot , recalled that during one strafing run , he could only use the cannon in one wing , as @entity8 and @entity25 troops were fighting so closely			1
on one freezing night , embattled marines watched in awe as a single star appeared through the clouds above their base			1
( that star later became the veterans ' emblem			2
) and as @entity8 advanced and @entity54 forces evacuated @entity3 , a single ship , the @entity152 , carried 14,000 desperate refugees to safety in the @entity155 , earning the title " @entity157			1
" such scenes demand cinematic treatment			2
in 2010 , @entity160 - based @entity42 produced an award - winning documentary , " @entity164 , " and has since been working on a feature film : " 17 days of @entity165			1
" two years ago , all looked rosy			2
oscar - winners signed on : @entity169 ( best effects , visual effects for " @entity171 " ) as director and @entity173 ( @entity174 for " @entity175 " ) as scriptwriter			2
after finishing the script , @entity173 died last year , complicating revisions			0
the project then hit a funding gridlock , leaving the movie in indefinite limbo			0
" obstacles are not uncommon for these kinds of projects , " said @entity42			0
" sometimes , it takes a year ; sometimes a decade ; sometimes they never happen			0
" if the project never happens , it would be par for the course for the @entity34			0
the conflict left such little mark on popular culture that it is dubbed " @entity34			0
" " @entity3 was not a war like the @entity197 , that intellectuals went to fight in , " said @entity195 , author of " the @entity3			0
" " there are books and movies about it but no classics ; it needs to be revisited in modern times			0
" despite its near invisibility in art , the @entity34 marked numerous @entity209 milestones			0
it was the @entity209 's first " hot war ; " the first @entity54 war ; and the only time troops from the " free world " advanced into a communist state , @entity3			1
@entity214 's shock intervention also marked the first and only battlefield clash between the @entity25 and @entity8			1
but it ended with an inconclusive armistice , and while @entity3 remains 21st century news , the unfinished 1950 - 53 war lacks much of a cinematic image			1
although @entity222 has produced numerous classics on @entity27 and @entity224 , perhaps the only memorable @entity3 - set films are " @entity225 " ( 1959 ) and " mash " ( 1970 )			0
a 1952 film on @entity164 , called " @entity229 " barely does the material justice , some believe			0
" @entity3 is too hard to define in @entity222 terms : they put out movies of heroism and derring - do in @entity27 or arrogance and stupidity in @entity224 , and people understand , " said @entity232 a veteran @entity12 - based @entity25 correspondent			0
" we ca n't do that with @entity3			0
" " one problem with the @entity34 is generational : it happened after ' @entity244 ' but before the ' @entity248 , ' " added @entity245 , a culture critic and author of " @entity247			0
" " so for much of @entity222 , it never really happened			0
" but poignantly for the war 's aging veterans , this year may mark probably its last significant commemoration : july 27 , 2013 is the 60th anniversary of its end			0
the anniversary has raised some hopes for a filmic treatment			0
" i 'm disappointed that @entity222 has n't done a feature film on this largely overlooked battle , " said @entity110			1
" it would contain drama , horror and suspense , and would be a major attraction on the 60th anniversary of the armistice			0
" since december , @entity42 and business partner @entity269 , another @entity268 , have raised more than $ 30,000 on @entity270 , a fundraising website , to produce a @entity271 animated short on the battle and are finalizing a graphic novel			1
" there is a collective purpose with our @entity164 products : create awareness , " @entity42 said			0
" we decided to continue the story on different platforms			0
" @entity42 ' passion for @entity164 is such that , with his proposed movie having just a " 50 - 50 " chance of production , he would applaud competing projects			0
" if someone else makes this movie , i 'll support them , " he said			0
" for the @entity34 , there 's not enough consciousness			0

dramatic battle took place at freezing @entity38 over 17 days in 1950
@entity54 troops were surrounded by large number of @entity8 soldiers
@entity8 sustained heavy losses as troops *succumbed* to firepower and cold
efforts to translate the battle to the big screen have largely failed
