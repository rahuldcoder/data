-- editor 's note : watch @entity0 's tv theme week @entity4 from june 10 - 17 on @entity5 , @entity6 and i - desk			2
last week a smartly dressed elderly gentleman sat patiently in a crowd on a sunny afternoon in @entity10 awaiting his part in a super-hero movie			2
unusually , for an extra , the man was attracting as much attention as the film 's a-list cast			0
while spider - man sweltered beneath his lycra suit , 90 - year - old @entity17 coolly answered questions from fans of his own , eager to know how he helped create the webbed super-hero , along with @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , the @entity28 and scores of other heroes of the @entity32 books			1
in an interview with @entity0 , the @entity33 of comic book heroes downplayed his role in history , claiming he just did as he was told : " the publisher had me doing western magazines , crime magazines , men 's adventure magazines , even romance and teenage magazines and one day he came to me and he said you know one of our competitors has a book called the @entity51 and it 's selling well and it 's a bunch of superheroes , why do n't we do some superhero magazines ? i said ok , i wanted to keep my job so i came up with the @entity28 and the others and that was the only reason			1
if my publisher had n't said ' let 's do superhero stories ' i 'd probably still be doing a kid called @entity62 , the @entity61 or @entity63 or whatever i was doing at the time			0
" @entity17 admits that the superhero universe he co-created more than fifty years ago was almost entirely devoid of super-heroines			1
" the reason there have n't been as many super-heroines as superheroes is when we first started doing these kind of stories , when @entity32 was first doing the @entity28 and @entity75 and the x-men there were many more men , there were many more males than females buying comic books so we always really directed our stories towards the male reader and we had male readers and male super-heroes			1
" nowadays he says , the female audience for comic book heroes is huge and hopes to see the shift reflected in the stories and their characters			1
more from comic book heroes : @entity93 superheroes team with @entity94 " @entity96 this field became so popular that the boys ' sisters started reading the stories and getting interested in them			1
now when we have a movie like @entity25 or the @entity103 or @entity24 , you 'll get as many females going to the theatre as males therefore i predict you will see pretty much as many super-heroines as superheroes as time goes by			2
" after half a century of seeing @entity112 comic book giants @entity32 and @entity113 exporting @entity112 heroes to the world , @entity17 feels it 's time for a change			1
" we figured it 's about time that we had heroes who were n't just all @entity112 and what we would be more and what would be more interesting than having a superhero who is @entity123 ? so @entity17 created the @entity124 -- an animated character which he hopes will become the star of a super-hero movie co-produced with @entity123			1
" he has many of the @entity123 characteristics and virtues that one would expect in a @entity123 movie but we have successfully transferred them to a movie of worldwide appeal but we have n't lost the feeling of what it 's like to be a @entity123 young man who is suddenly thrust in to an adventure which involves a super power and a super foe but he 's guided by the background , his own background and his @entity123 heritage , the things he 's learned , the things he 's experienced			2
" but how will @entity123 react to such an imported hero ? " i see no reason why a @entity123 audience would n't love a @entity123 superhero created by an @entity112 or created by anyone else as long as the character is exciting and authentic and interesting			2
" more from comic book heroes : test your knowledge in our superhero quiz ! @entity17 is also working on the launch of a digital comic book hero for @entity159 -- @entity160 the @entity161			1
" i think that audiences throughout the world love superheroes			0
i mean you could go back to the time of @entity167 , whether it 's @entity169 or @entity170			0
every type , every nationality , every culture has had superheroes in their legends			0
people love that sort of thing			0
the @entity180 gods and so forth			0
" he hopes the rise of the super-hero blockbuster movie will inspire young fans to follow in his footsteps			0
" every generation has its brilliant young people who want to do these films and i think that more and more talented people get involved and as long as that happens we will always have new and exciting themes for these films			0
" @entity17 believes that this will ensure continuing interest in comic book characters which have stood the test of time			1
" the thing about superhero stories , they are like fairy tales for grown ups			2
every child loved reading fairy tales when he or she was a child			0
they were stories about monsters and witches and giants and magicians , well superhero stories have that same flavor but they are done for adults as well as for children			0
