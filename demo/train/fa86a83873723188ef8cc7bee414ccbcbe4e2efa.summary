" to make the choice to be happy despite whatever sad or tragic circumstances you may be living through ... he is this old soul who inspires everyone he meets			0
you leave and you think : ' i want to be a better person			0
' " watch @entity74 's film and you can see why			2
there 's @entity1 , a fresh - faced @entity93 teenager , in one of the opening frames , saying : " i want everyone to know : you do n't have to find out you 're dying to start living			1
" he tells us at the beginning of the film : " you know most people live kind of in the middle , in between ' all your dreams come true ' and ' you 're dying , ' and it 's a very comfortable place to live			1
i 'm living on the two extreme ends , so you have really , really good days and you have really , really bad days			0
" he has lived on those extreme ends for the better part of the past four years			0
@entity1 's sleeping most of the day now			1
the other night he was able to muster up enough energy to bring out his guitar and play			0
" it 's those times when we remember how it used to be , " says his mom			2
she tells me about a trip the family took last year , " a sort of pilgrimage to @entity123 , " with 10 intense days of sightseeing			2
" we packed a lot into those 10 days , " she recalls , " and maybe these past 3Â½ years have been like that pilgrimage			0
i have n't had the chance to let it sink in			0
i do n't let myself go to that place of grief			0
there will be plenty of time to think about what we have lost later			0
" " right now ... right now i feel really grateful , " she continues			0
" that is the core of what i feel			0
i still get up in the morning and look forward to the day			0
" and maybe , she says , that is the lesson here : that no matter where you are in life , look at what you have and be grateful			0
it 's the kind of thing you hear all the time			2
putting it into action takes some work sometimes			0
but there are always things in life to be grateful for , no matter where you are			0
being grateful is the doorway to all sorts of other good things , says @entity19			0
" that 's what @entity156 always been really good at : recognizing what is good and being grateful for it			2
it 's the first thing he seeks out , his starting point			2
he taught all of us how it 's done			2
" @entity165 , one of the @entity40 commenters on @entity1 's video , writes : " well , you got a 6 ' , 220 pound man sobbing his face off here			1
prayers and thoughts with you , @entity1 ... i hope someday i can be half the man you 've become			1
" i swallow a sob			0
me too , i think as i watch the video			0
at that moment , @entity1 sings : " and maybe someday i 'll see you again			1
