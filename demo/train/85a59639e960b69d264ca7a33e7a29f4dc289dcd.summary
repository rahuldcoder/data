it sounds like advice offered by parents to teenagers on prom night : do n't do stupid stuff			2
but it also is an important guiding foreign policy principle of the @entity7			1
ever since the president uttered the phrase during an off - the - record discussion with reporters earlier this year -- the actual words were a bit saltier and later confirmed privately by administration officials -- foreign policy critics have seized on " @entity16 " as a crystallization of the @entity18			1
former secretary of state @entity19 is only the latest critic of the " @entity16 " comment , describing the remark in an interview with the @entity24 magazine as too simplistic			1
" great nations need organizing principles , and ' do n't do stupid stuff ' is not an organizing principle , " she said			1
@entity29 called @entity30 on tuesday , to " make sure he knows that nothing she said was an attempt to attack him , " her spokesman @entity28 said in a statement			1
the two will meet at a party hosted by @entity40 adviser @entity39 on @entity41 on wednesday evening , after she holds a book signing on the island			0
in an interview with @entity46 , deputy national security adviser @entity44 insisted that " @entity16 " is not the " entire foreign policy " of the @entity30 administration			1
but he maintained the expression has substance			0
" it means think carefully before you get into military interventions , " he said			0
" i think that 's a lesson of the last 10 years that the @entity56 people have internalized -- that we have to be very careful when it comes to the application of military force , that we 're not putting @entity56 troops in harm 's way without a clear plan and limited objectives for that effort			0
" opinion : @entity19 pummels @entity30 's foreign policy @entity44 said the president did not take the criticism from @entity29 personally			1
" i think their relationship is very resilient			0
they 've been through so much together , " he said			0
what hand will @entity74 play in @entity76 shaped by more than a decade of war @entity29 's apparent support for a more hawkish @entity56 posture comes as @entity30 's foreign policy has absorbed withering criticism in recent weeks			1
but her potentially more interventionist approach carries its own set of risks , diplomatic and political analysts caution			0
" ' do n't do stupid stuff ' ought to be emblazoned on the foreheads of all future presidents and secretaries of state , " said @entity85 , a former @entity86 adviser during both @entity40 and @entity88 administrations			1
@entity85 said " @entity16 " is less a doctrine than it is a presidential mission statement that is shaped by more than a decade of war			0
" stripped to its essence , after protecting the homeland , it should be @entity56 foreign policy 's second commandment , " he added			1
" i view that as a political summary ... much like ' it 's the economy , stupid , ' " rep. @entity101 , @entity102 , said , comparing " @entity16 " to the middle - class battle cry coined by @entity29 strategist @entity104 during the 1992 presidential election			0
@entity101 said the former secretary of state 's comments do not reflect a political break from the president , arguing the perception of a conflict just makes " good copy			1
" opinion : @entity29 , @entity30 both wrong the president 's strategy on crises ranging from @entity119 to @entity76 and @entity120 offers a sharp contrast to @entity88 who " act first and think last , " @entity101 said			1
" the risks of becoming fully entangled in @entity76 are tremendous , " he added			0
the president 's cautious approach is nothing new			2
a line can be traced from " @entity16 " to the anti-iraq war speech he delivered as an @entity130 state senator in 2002			0
" what i am opposed to is a dumb war			0
what i am opposed to is a rash war , " @entity30 said at the time			2
scars from 2008 primary still remain it was that 2002 speech that endeared @entity30 to the liberal base of the @entity40 , in part because of then - sen. @entity29 's support for the @entity76 war			1
the policy battle over @entity76 that later erupted between @entity30 and @entity29 in their fight for the party 's nomination ultimately resulted in a @entity148 returning to the @entity149			1
but the divide left deep scars between the two camps that were still healing even as @entity29 unleashed her critique of @entity30 's worldview			1
that difficult history is why @entity29 's comments to the @entity24 's @entity158 came as a shock to one senior @entity40 strategist , who spoke on condition of anonymity			0
specifically disturbing , the strategist said , was the former secretary of state 's insistence that @entity30 's lack of support for the @entity119 opposition gave rise to the @entity171 militants in @entity76			1
" why you 'd want to do that , i have no idea , " the prominent , @entity173 affiliated strategist said of @entity29 's plea for more direct @entity56 involvement in @entity119			0
citing the nation 's reluctance to plunge back into @entity183 conflicts , the strategist added , " politically , @entity30 's right			1
" in a flashback to ' 08 , @entity185 lunged to the president 's defense tuesday , in a tweet that appeared to tweak @entity29			2
" just to clarify : ' do n't do stupid stuff ' means stuff like occupying @entity76 in the first place , which was a tragically bad decision , " former @entity30 adviser @entity190 tweeted			1
better job communicating its strategy still , even the president 's own advisers acknowledge that @entity30 has had a difficult time clearly articulating his foreign policy doctrine			1
during his overseas trip to @entity201 this year , @entity30 used a baseball metaphor to explain his reluctance to intervene militarily against a variety of threats , including @entity119 president @entity206 , who crossed a " red line " set by the president barring chemical weapon use			1
that caution " avoids errors , " @entity30 said			2
" you hit singles , you hit doubles ; every once in a while , we may be able to hit a home run			0
" after much of @entity219 pounced on the sports analogy , @entity149 aides began plotting out a more thoughtful speech on @entity56 leadership that would be delivered at @entity223			0
before that address , @entity44 conceded to the @entity225 that the administration could do a better job of communicating its strategy			0
" people are seeing the trees , but we 're not necessarily laying out the forest , " @entity44 said			0
@entity30 told the cadets at @entity223 the @entity56 should be willing to intervene , but not overreach , acting alone only when necessary			2
" just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail , " @entity30 said , opting to switch metaphors			2
the apparent struggle to neatly encapsulate the president 's strategy is not lost on his critics			2
" i do think the administration is showing some signs of a little bit of fatigue , " @entity243 analyst @entity242 said in a recent interview with @entity46			0
" it 's time for a little more ambition frankly because the world senses that this president is too disengaged , " @entity242 added			2
a now more ambitious @entity30 is engaged in @entity76 , risking what his aides have long described as his post-bush legacy of " ending wars , not starting them			2
" as past presidents have learned in @entity76 , it is " easy to get in , hell to get out , " @entity101 said .			0

@entity19 called @entity30 's guiding foreign policy principle too simplistic
@entity30 did n't take the former secretary of state 's criticism personally , an adviser says
those within his inner circle admit the president has had problems articulating his policy
