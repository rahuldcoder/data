-- when high schoolers tour the world 's largest nuclear research facility from their desks , or teachers have a chance to see the classroom through students ' eyes , that 's the power of @entity11			1
but even as @entity14 's much buzzed - about wearable computer makes its way into the hands of technophiles , law enforcement and firefighters , it might be a while before it comes to a school near you			2
slowly , @entity11 is starting to turn up in schools			1
a handful of educators are beta testers in @entity14 's @entity26			1
they 're capturing videos and images of classroom activities through a small camera built into @entity33 ' frame , and sharing them online			0
they use @entity33 to teach lessons from their perspective to share with others , or for their own reference			0
they 're propping the glasses on students , and using the footage and images from young people to understand what they see and how they learn			2
even with limited applications and functionality in these early versions of @entity11 , some teachers and technology enthusiasts see huge potential			1
" the possibilities are endless as more applications are developed for the device and as @entity33 gets into the hands of more teachers and students , " said @entity53 , a former librarian and technology consultant who serves on the board of @entity57			1
" having a single pair of @entity11 in the classroom reminds me of the days of the one - computer classroom			1
everyone had to wait for a turn to use the device , " @entity53 , a @entity14 certified teacher , said in an e-mail			0
" i think once we see a k - 12 school pilot with a classroom set of @entity33 , there will be many more practical and creative uses showcased			0
" the virtual field trip is often touted as a use for @entity33 , and there are apps in development expected to display information about locations the @entity33 wearer sees			1
@entity14 sent online educator @entity84 to @entity85 in 2013 so he could lead students on a virtual tour of the @entity88 at the @entity89 known as @entity89			1
through a @entity94 hangout , students from @entity91 in @entity92 watched @entity84 walk through the world 's largest and most powerful particle accelerator , taking their questions and pointing out features			1
even more common , educators broadcast from inside the classroom , leading science labs , group discussions or even performing surgery for remote audiences			0
they show it in real time through @entity94 hangouts and as videos shared later through @entity109 , personal blogs and other forms of social media			0
after his field trip , @entity84 continued using @entity33 by making a series of instructional science and math videos called @entity117			2
when a @entity120 high school student had to miss school for medical reasons , chemistry teacher @entity118 asked the student 's friend to wear @entity33 during science labs and broadcast them to her in a @entity94 hangout			2
an online group for @entity129 in @entity130 lets users share similar stories and pose questions to the group of 612 members			0
but @entity11 in every classroom could be a long way off			1
there 's a long list of reasons why the most intriguing device in tech just is n't ready for school : @entity33 is expected to be more widely available toward the end of 2014 , but the $ 1,500 price tag is a significant barrier for schools and teachers			1
so far , there 's no educational discount , teachers said , and @entity14 has n't announced plans to partner with educational institutions			1
its short battery life needs to be resolved before broader implementation is possible , teachers said , and @entity33 is mired in privacy concerns , especially when children are involved			1
" to me , the greatest value of @entity33 so far is n't what it 's able to do , but the conversation being had nationally about how we interact with technology and how we want it to be part of society , " said @entity84 , who teaches online math and science classes			2
@entity84 views @entity33 as another tool in his arsenal , but it 's " not necessarily the best for every situation , " he said			2
" i think the $ 1,500 would be better spent on three @entity175 , " he said			0
still , early adopters in education are looking for ways to make it work			2
@entity179 , lower school technology coordinator at the @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity183 , has been documenting her experiences using @entity33 in class on on her blog , 365 days of @entity33			0
she saw potential in @entity33 as a tool to capture moments of discovery and learning through her students ' eyes , in line with the @entity196 philosophy she embraces as an educator			0
since april 2013 , she 's used @entity33 to document the day 's activities and post video highlights online			2
@entity33 gives her the benefit of doing it hands - free , so she can maintain eye contact and interact with students while gathering information , she said			0
periodically , she puts together video clips around specific topics , like teaching students about coding , as presentations for parents			0
she lets students use the device to document their experience making @entity216 crafts or playing in the snow to share with partner classrooms around the country			1
among its greatest benefits so far ? @entity222 said she can finally see the classroom through the eyes of her students , who range from pre-k to second grade			0
it shows which details catch their attention , and sometimes reveals simple problems , like when @entity222 realized she was posting some information too high for her young students to see			0
" it has been really interesting to try it because their perspective is so unique and different from ours , which is why i think ( @entity33 ) has a lot of potential with these age ranges , " she said			0
" to get just a few moments to see how they learn to do a math problem , or to get a sense of their vantage point is so great for teachers			0
" how would you feel about your child using @entity11 at school ? share your thoughts in the comments , on @entity254 or on @entity257 's @entity256 page !			1

a handful of teachers have started using @entity11 in their classrooms
it 's used for virtual field trips , to document lab work and reveal students ' perspectives
the cost , battery life and privacy concerns might keep it out of schools , teachers said
