-- foreign governments should urgently accept @entity3 orphans on humanitarian grounds following this week 's devastating earthquake , an orphanage director in @entity3 and adoptive parents said friday			1
emergency visas and passports could help push through adoptions that were stalled after the quake , and would open up beds for children who lost their parents in the disaster , said @entity16 , director of @entity19 's @entity18 orphanage just outside @entity20			1
paperwork for adoptions that were under way when the earthquake hit tuesday night may now be buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings and lost , said @entity16 , whose orphanage cares for 152 children , including 84 babies			1
the government officials who deal with adoption cases may be missing , hurt , or otherwise focused on the disaster , which means the adoptions wo n't go through , she said			1
" i would like to see the international community come up with a plan for the children that have been adopted by @entity36 , @entity37 , and @entity39 citizens of how these children can go to their adoptive parents ' countries , either under refugee status or emergency status of some sort , " @entity16 told @entity0			2
@entity19 's @entity18 is considered one of @entity3 's larger orphanages			1
parents who have adopted children through the orphanage are also pressing their governments for emergency action			1
" the orphans need to be granted refugee status and allowed to come home to their adoptive parents , " said @entity53 of @entity54 , @entity55 , who adopted a boy from @entity58 and brought him home last year			0
" the @entity39 needs to not only allow but demand that children be sent to their adoptive families right away			2
" @entity66 citizen @entity65 , who arrived in @entity3 hours before the earthquake hit to sign paperwork as part of the adoption process , wrote a public letter urging foreign help			1
" i can not express the sheer magnitude of the plight that the children of this country have faced , one which will now spiral downwards further with devastating results , " @entity65 wrote in the letter			2
" the situation is dire -- there will be many more children in need of help , and @entity58 and other orphanages can not cope with the increased need			2
" the foreign ministries of @entity66 , @entity87 , and @entity88 said they could not immediately respond , but @entity90 's @entity89 said it was aware of the issue			0
" the @entity90 authorities are informed of the situation of @entity96 and the children at the orphanage @entity19 's @entity18 , and our authorities are in touch with the @entity101 and the local authorities to solve the issue , " spokesman @entity93 told @entity0			2
@entity16 said her request is only for those children who have been adopted but who are still in @entity3 as their cases go through a lengthy government approval process which can take anywhere from six months to two years			1
the children 's paperwork may have been in the pipeline but after the quake , the status is now unclear , @entity16 said			1
" some of my papers were in the @entity116 -- that building is no longer there , " she said			0
" some of my paperwork was in the @entity119 -- i do n't know if that building is there			0
i had passports being printed ( for the children )			0
i do n't know if the paperwork is still there			0
" @entity16 said her lawyer told her the country 's top adoptions official , judge @entity126 , was killed when the courthouse collapsed			0
as long as the adopted children can make it out of the country , @entity16 said , the orphanage can ensure the children 's paperwork is completed in @entity3			1
if the children ca n't leave the country , it will mean orphanages like @entity16 's must turn away any children newly orphaned by the earthquake , she said			0
" it leaves me with children in my care who are going to sit here for an additional five , six months at least , " she said			0
" it 's going to prevent me from taking in any children that were affected by this disaster			0
i ca n't take any children in , not unless i put them on the floor or i put two or three children to a bed			0
