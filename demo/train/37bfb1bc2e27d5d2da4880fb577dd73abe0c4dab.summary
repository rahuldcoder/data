-- does the best transport technology come from outside the @entity2 ? that was the question pondered at the @entity5 event last month			1
guests from around the world were invited to guarantee that the conversation would not be too @entity10 centric			0
@entity12 chairman @entity11 argued at the debate that much of the best innovation in transportation has come from outside the @entity2 and even predicted that the building of what he called " a collision proof mobility system " would most likely be realized outside the @entity2			2
" other countries will probably get there first , " @entity11 predicted of this kind of large - scale transportation project , " because some other leader will recognize this as an opportunity to revolution their economy			2
" read more : self - driving cars hit the road as an example of @entity33 innovation , @entity11 spoke particularly highly about the work of @entity35 , the @entity36 creator of the electric vehicle network @entity38 which , he noted , is " far ahead " of anything created in the @entity2 but even @entity38 pales in comparison to @entity41 , a $ 35 billion @entity43 city of the future built from the ground up			2
as @entity46 , co-founder and general partner of the @entity49 venture fund @entity50 noted , @entity41 is " basically a transportation lab where they are experimenting with various kinds of car sharing to bike sharing to water taxis and intelligent highways			1
" well perhaps not quite everything			0
absent from the $ 35 billion @entity43 city of the future are flying cars			1
but flying cars do actually exist			1
as @entity66 , international trade director at @entity68 , explained , they are being developed by a @entity70 start - up , @entity72 - @entity71 " you need a helicopter license to drive that thing , " @entity66 said about the @entity74 flying car			0

as @entity85 , who heads up @entity12 's @entity83 office , explained , car sharing exists in @entity87 but with a twist			1
" in @entity87 you just wave down a car and they take you somewhere , " @entity85 told the @entity5 audience about a @entity83 version of the @entity2 car sharing network @entity92			1
" what 's the business model ? " i asked him			0
" there is no business model , " he said			0
@entity85 explained about this truly collaborative @entity103 ride - sharing phenomenon : " it is individuals driving around finding individuals who need a place to go .			0

countries around the world are innovating to create new modes of transportation
from car sharing schemes and *smart* cities to flying cars , many *possibilities* within reach
many *progressive* ideas come from outside of the @entity2
