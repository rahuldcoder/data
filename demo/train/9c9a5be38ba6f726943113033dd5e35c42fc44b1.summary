-- traveling in a plane soaring 2,400 meters above the ocean when the door in front of you suddenly swings open , is many things : terrifying , disturbing , dramatic			2
for former @entity9 prime minister @entity8 , it was also " a bit annoying			1
" if it seems like the understatement of the century , then that 's because you get the impression there is n't much that rattles the 63 - year - old , who is now the third most powerful person at the @entity20			1
back in 2005 , the then - prime minister was flying along the south west coast of @entity9 when her six - seater plane hit turbulence , forcing the door to swing open			1
after some scrambling the rogue door was closed , and @entity27 -- today the administrator of the @entity28 -- landed safely , though with a badly bruised elbow			1
that was the " annoying " bit , she said			2
eight years later , securely seated in the @entity20 office in @entity33 , one of the longest serving female prime ministers of all time says " nothing " scares her			1
well , apart from a few extreme sports			0
" i think i 've conquered fear , " she said			0
" except i 'm not going into a parachute jump			0
i do n't want to go into a bungee jump -- wonderful revenue earner for @entity9 tourism that it is			1
and i do n't want to do a deep sea dive , " she said			0
" so there 's three things off my list but i 'll try almost anything else			2
" small country , big ambition almost a decade before @entity53 chancellor @entity52 was toasting a third consecutive term in office , @entity27 was on the other side of the world celebrating her own successful third election			0
@entity27 , the leader of the @entity59 , led the country for nine years , from 1999 to 2008			0
that 's just two years less than @entity63 prime minister @entity62			1
and six years longer than recently ousted @entity65 prime minister @entity64			1
since leaving politics and joining the @entity20 in 2009 , @entity27 's international profile has continued to grow -- this year @entity68 ' ranked her as the 21st most powerful woman in the world			1
" i could not have credibly done this job [ at the @entity20 ] if i had not had the experience of leading a small country , " she said of @entity9 , which has a population of around 4 million			1
" there 's no greater accountability than having to face your own electors every three years			0
so i like to think this has been a preparation for this position now			2
" women of the world @entity27 is also the first female to head the @entity28 , overseeing 8,000 staff in 177 countries , and an annual budget of $ 5.8 billion			1
her vision is a big one : " eradication of poverty and tackling exclusion and inequality in our world -- and doing it in a sustainable way			0
" where does one start with such an immense goal ? for @entity27 , part of the answer lies in the empowerment of women			2
" if you ca n't inherit the family property , if you ca n't borrow money , if you ca n't hold title to land or a rental title because you 're a woman -- this is n't fair , " she said			2
" @entity111 attitudes towards women can be the tremendous unseen barriers -- people do n't see a woman doing certain jobs			2
i 've had a lot of experience of crashing my head through glass ceilings so i know it can be done , but it 's not something you do by yourself			2
you have to build support networks			0
" force of nature growing up on a farm in @entity9 , @entity27 learned to be self - reliant from a young age -- a trait she 's held throughout her career			1
" we slaughtered our own meat , we grew our own vegetables			0
i think i come from generations of extremely resilient people who tend to survive through thick and thin , " she said			0
to illustrate her point , @entity27 recalls meeting another head of state on the steps of @entity9 parliament one day : " i had the keys in my hand and i said ' come along with me			1
' i unlocked the door to the private lift and took him up			0
where was the army of functionaries who were opening the door pressing the lift button ? " when her party suffered a devastating defeat at the 1990 elections , @entity27 was down , but not out			0
" i became well known in @entity9 for saying ' let 's move on , ' " she said			1
" another door will open if you look for it			0
" and while leading the @entity28 has been one of her greatest achievements , it has come with sacrifices , such as working on the other side of the world from husband @entity163			1
" i do n't necessarily want to be remembered as the most popular girl on the block , " she said			0
" i want to be remembered as the girl who made a difference			0
