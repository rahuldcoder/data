-- it 's a simple thing , really , the rubber and stainless steel band that a well - known ceo frequently wears around his wrist			2
but the @entity6 that @entity8 's @entity7 has been seen sporting at multiple public events is just one clue about a possible deal between @entity8 and @entity11 that could be part of the sales pitch when a rumored @entity8 watch hits the market			1
late on friday ( the traditional time of the week for companies to release bad news ) , came a news report that @entity11 had laid off much of the team responsible for the @entity19 and would not continue to update the line of wearable gadgets , which measure physical activity and monitor things like heart rate and calories burned			1
@entity11 had planned to release a new , thinner @entity19 in the fall , but those plans have reportedly been shelved and the company wo n't say whether there will be a new one			1
@entity11 has said it plans to continue supporting the current @entity19 for the " forseeable future " and that new color options will be available			1
still , the retreat seems odd for a company that has made its name in sports equipment -- and has led to speculations that @entity11 may be working on a new partnership with @entity8			1
" obviously @entity8 has enjoyed a healthy relationship with them over the years , " said @entity39 , a @entity40 analyst who follows @entity8			2
" our view has been that the fitness band will largely fold into the smartwatch in the future and most of the players will exit the market			0
if i were them , makes more sense to partner with @entity8 , but that is just my opinion			1
" @entity11 spokesman @entity56 said in an email that @entity19 remains " an important part " of @entity11 's business			1
he confirmed there will be a " small number " of layoffs and emphasized the company 's continuing work on digital products , including partnerships with companies like @entity8			0
" partnering with industry - leading tech companies is nothing new for @entity11 , " @entity56 said			2
" we have been working with @entity8 to develop products since 2006 , when the two companies introduced @entity11 + running , and @entity11 has since create apps for the @entity74 including @entity11 , @entity75 + @entity19 and @entity75 + move which launched in @entity76			1
" building on these successful products and services , @entity11 and @entity8 are partnering on emerging technologies to create better solutions for athletes			2
" could that partnership evolve into a forthcoming @entity8 - @entity11 wearable product ? that is still just conjecture at this point			1
but consider : -- already , @entity8 's @entity74 system is the only mobile system that can be used with the @entity88 and its set of apps			0
-- @entity7 has sat on @entity11 's board of directors for the past nine years			0
and the two companies have already teamed up to create the @entity11 + mobile app for iphones and ipods			0
-- in september , @entity8 hired @entity11 's @entity96 , the man behind the " @entity97 " that created @entity88			2
-- @entity8 is the highest - profile company that has not yet entered the wearable tech field -- despite the fact that rumors of an " @entity102 " have been swirling for years			1
with @entity104 , @entity105 and other competitors already selling wearable gear , it would make sense for @entity8 to get into the game sooner rather than later			0
@entity8 's @entity110 is set to begin on june 2 , and the company has used the event in the past to announce new products			0
alternately , @entity8 has made a habit of introducing a new iphone every fall , in advance of the holiday shopping season			0
it would certainly make sense to unveil a new product then as well			0
@entity8 did not reply to a message seeking comment for this story .			0

as @entity11 pulls back from @entity19 , @entity8 speculation emerges
the companies have ties , from @entity8 ceo on down
analyst says it makes sense for @entity11 to leave *hardware* to others
a long - rumored @entity8 " @entity102 " could come this year
