-- perhaps you 've been to the @entity2 , toured @entity3 or visited @entity4 and discovered the glorious nature and historical events celebrated and protected by our national parks			1
ever been to the longest cave in the world ? or the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier islands in the world ? known to many national park aficionados who collect park passport stamps , the lesser - known national parks throughout the country are also worthy of your visit			1
@entity21 will have special programming during @entity23 , april 21 - 29			2
and parks that charge admission will waive their fees that week , adding to their allure			2
" the options are endless -- view spectacular scenery , see where history happened , take a hike , go on a picnic or look for wildlife , " said @entity30 , director of the @entity31			1
" be sure to ' picture yourself in a national park ' this week and share your photos , videos , and stories at @entity43			2
" think a national park is too far away ? every @entity46 state except @entity47 has at least one national park , as do @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and the @entity51			2
in celebration of @entity23 and @entity55 on april 22 , here are our suggestions for heading back to nature			2
@entity59 ( @entity60 ) : for nearly 5,000 years , people have lived uninterrupted in @entity62 , longer than anyplace else on the @entity64			1
about 40 @entity66 families live within the park boundaries , farming the land and raising livestock			2
the @entity31 and the @entity70 jointly manage the park , and during @entity23 , there will be free ranger - led hikes and programs			2
other tours are self - guided and free , but some require a @entity66 guide and a fee			2
the visitor center includes a silversmith demonstration area			2
@entity83 ( @entity84 ) : take a tour of the longest cave in the world at @entity83 in south - central @entity84 , where 390 miles of cave passages have already been explored			1
a couple of the cave tours will be free during @entity23			1
( tour tickets are still required , so make sure to call for a reservation or get tickets at the visitor center			2
) there will also be special walks and activities for @entity98 on april 21 and @entity99 on april 28			2
there is also boating , canoeing , fishing , camping and horseback riding in the park			0
@entity104 ( @entity105 ) : minutes from the hustle and bustle of @entity108 , @entity104 is an incredible combination of 10,000 years of human history and four different ecosystems that have come together in this protected area			1
first - time visitors to the park can enjoy a free daily ranger - led tour or a free two - to three - hour canoe tour every monday , wednesday and friday through april			0
boat tours are also available through independent companies ( fees vary )			0
experienced adult outdoor enthusiasts can book an all - day kayak trip every saturday through april ( cost is $ 89 )			0
most of the park is covered by water , but do n't simply motor up in your own boat or forget to plan ahead			0
the time of year determines , in part , what 's available to do at the park			1
@entity132 ( @entity133 ) : it 's the longest section of undeveloped barrier island in the world			1
@entity137 , @entity138 and the @entity139 all laid claim to @entity132 , which was finally taken over by the @entity46 after the @entity141 ( 1845 - 1848 )			1
the island was named after @entity137 priest @entity143 , who established the first permanent settlement there around 1804			0
@entity146 nesting season started april 1 , and sea turtle hatchling releases may start in late may			1
( call the @entity148 at 361 - 949 - 7163 for more information			0
) there are also free ranger talks , birding tours and even a saturday night stargazing party			0
the park also has no - reservations camping , fishing , bring - your - own bike biking and swimming			0
think kid friendly : while most national parks have " kid friendly " recommendations , the parks will turn their attention to even more children 's events with @entity167 on saturday , may 19			1
there will be events at many of the nation 's parks and even outside the parks			1
( @entity47 , which has no national parks , still has two nature - filled events that day			0
) " kids love nature , and nature needs kids because without kids who love nature , we 'll have no grownups left to protect it , " said @entity176 , editorial director of @entity177			0
" i have three kids , and they love to be outside			0
experiencing nature is really inspiring for them , and it 's really important to get them outside of their daily life and into the woods or beach			1
" @entity191 has a few recommendations from the latest edition of " @entity194			0
" she likes the ranger - led nighttime " owl prowls " at @entity198 in @entity199			1
" also keep your eyes peeled for bobcats , river otter and wild pigs			1
" at @entity205 in @entity206 , she recommends exploring by canoe or backpacking into the backcountry , where you can sometimes spot moose and foxes			0
" in july and august , you can pick blueberries and thimbleberries in the park 's lush green meadows , " she said			1
@entity217 boasts an underwater nature trail in @entity219			0
" take a snorkel hike ! park animal sightings include sea turtles , pelicans and mongooses			1
" pick the park closest to you : @entity230 to the @entity31 website and plug in your state to find the park nearest to your home			0
if nature is n't your thing , chances are you 'll find many national park historic sites in urban and suburban areas			0
and if you need a guidebook to help you choose which of the 58 scenic national parks is right for you , try the latest edition of the " @entity243 to @entity244 of the @entity46 , " or visit the @entity177 national parks website			0
dress right : check a park 's website or your guidebook to see if you 'll need suntan lotion , warmer clothes for cave exploration , hiking shoes for hikes at higher elevations , bug spray for heading into swamps or other necessities , says @entity177 's @entity191			1
and know your child 's stamina for longer walks or thinner air at higher elevations			1
get the free app : the @entity31 now has a free app that will help you plan your park trips and track which of the 397 national parks you 've already visited ( even adding your photos and thoughts )			0
the app also helps @entity271 holders find passport stamp cancellation stations within the national parks to record which parks they visited and when			0
( most national parks participate in the program			0
) the app is available for iphones and @entity279 , and an @entity281 app is in development			0
