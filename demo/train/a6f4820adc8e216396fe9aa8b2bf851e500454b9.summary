-- a group of media companies on wednesday asked a @entity4 judge to unseal court documents in a lawsuit involving the @entity8 sex - tape case			1
the motion by the media companies , which include @entity0 , does not seek public release of the sex tape or any intimate photos that might exist			1
instead , it argues that most details in the case already have been made public by the parties themselves , and therefore the motions and depositions so far should be public records as called for under @entity4 law			1
@entity8 , a former @entity22 senator and @entity24 vice presidential candidate in 2004 , has given a deposition in the lawsuit of his former mistress , @entity27 , against former @entity8 aide @entity28			0
@entity29 , who bore a child of @entity8 , is suing @entity28 to reclaim materials that she says belong to her , including the alleged sex tape that involves @entity8			2
superior court judge @entity33 previously ordered the motion compelling @entity8 to give his deposition , as well as the deposition itself , to be sealed from public disclosure			2
" the public interest in senator @entity8 ' deposition and the other depositions in this case is significant , while the privacy interests of senator @entity8 and the parties -- who voluntarily participated in events of significant public importance and have widely and openly discussed all of the events underlying this litigation -- are negligible , " said the motion by the media companies			1
@entity28 was a senior aide to @entity8 who originally claimed that @entity29 's child was his own in an effort to shield @entity8 from having to make the disclosure			0
@entity8 eventually did acknowledge his paternity			0
his last public appearance was at the funeral for his wife , @entity59 , who passed away last december after a six - year battle with cancer			0
@entity8 also is under investigation about whether or not he illegally used campaign funds to cover up his affair with @entity29 , a campaign videographer .			0

a motion is filed by media companies including @entity0
it does not seek public release of the sex tape
instead , it seeks depositions in the case to be made public
