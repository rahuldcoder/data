@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity4 tourist kidnapped from a remote @entity1 resort is being held by pirates in a remote corner of @entity8 , according to experts and security analysts in @entity0			1
" gangs from @entity8 took her up the coast and then moved her several times , " said @entity11 , a piracy expert and maritime editor of @entity14 , an independent online publication			1
@entity20 was abducted by armed men from a remote safari lodge near to the @entity24 border earlier this month			1
her husband , @entity25 , was killed in the attack when he resisted , according to @entity1 police			1
a @entity1 man has been charged in connection with the attack , a lawyer familiar with the case told @entity2 monday			1
@entity32 , who worked at the luxury resort in @entity34 where the attack took place , was charged with robbery with violence and abducting with the intention to murder , according to a lawyer present at the hearing at the @entity43 law courts			2
@entity32 pleaded not guilty to both counts			0
a second man , @entity45 , is expected to appear in court at a later date			2
details of the incident are still sketchy and the @entity51 government has asked journalists not to reveal the exact location of @entity20 to avoid abduction attempts from rival gangs			2
initially , it was feared that @entity57 , the @entity58 - linked militant group , had conducted the operation as a revenge attack against the @entity51 nationals			0
but a security analyst based in @entity0 , who tracks piracy operations but is not authorized to speak to the media , also believes this is the work of pirates			1
" this is not the work of @entity57 , " he said , " this is the work of southern armed gangs and pirates			2
" no ransom demands have been made yet , says @entity11			0
but if @entity24 pirates carried out the operation , it represents a marked departure in tactics			1
for years , pirates have attacked commercial ships in the busy shipping lanes between @entity82 and @entity83			0

since the whole push against piracy by international navies , the pirates have been looking for new territory and new frontiers			0
" @entity92 says that @entity1 is a natural target because if its porous border with @entity8 and a high number of foreign visitors and workers			1
the @entity1 government , prompted by their reliance on tourism for foreign exchange , says they are making every effort to secure the border with @entity8			1
others say that , rather than a trend , this is a one - time attack caused by a more prosaic fact : the weather			0
