as @entity1 , the largest social media platform in @entity2 , gets ready for its initial public offering , a recent university study claims @entity2 micro-blogging activity might not be as vibrant as expected			1
only 5 % of @entity1 users generate original posts , while the rest of the @entity2 micro-blogging world just re-posts from them , according to research by @entity12 from the @entity13			1
he also found that more than half of the registered accounts were " empty " with little or no activity			0
@entity1 claims it has 130 million active users -- though @entity12 believes the definition of " active user " is debatable			1
in march , @entity1 filed to debut on the @entity23 @entity22 exchange			2
it updated its regulatory filing last week , adjusting its offer to 20 million shares for $ 17 to $ 19 apiece , which would value the company at $ 3.9 billion			1
the ipo launch sparks discussions on the company 's worth			1
@entity33 @entity12 has been running his @entity1 monitoring project since january 2011			2
dubbed the " @entity36 , " the computer program was originally set up to expose and make publicly available the censored posts from a select group of users with more than 1,000 followers			0
@entity1 penetrates deep into the @entity2 online world			2
by 2012 , one in every two @entity2 netizens used @entity1 , according to the @entity44			2
that year was also when @entity12 began analyzing the usage pattern of @entity1 's registered accounts			1
to obtain representative data , @entity12 and his team obtained the timelines of a random sample of micro-bloggers			0
in march 2013 , @entity12 had looked at nearly 30,000 @entity1 accounts			2
he found that 57 % of the account timelines were empty , and out of the active ones about 4.8 % contributed more than 80 % of the original posts			2
@entity12 stepped up his research in january and found the figures were becoming more pronounced			0
sampling 1,500 accounts each week , @entity12 found only 5 % , or just 10 million users , generate most of the original posts on @entity1			1
in contrast , @entity1 claims it has 130 million active users but does not say whether these users post original content			1
but @entity1 spokesperson @entity65 questioned the analysis			2
" the researcher does n't have any cooperation with our database and he did n't obtain any data by accessing our official interface , as far as i know , " he said			2
" we know better than they do about our own numbers			0
i do n't intend to offend third parties , but i believe our data are more accurate			0
" however , @entity12 argued his study is a better reflection of user activity			0
" in the @entity1 's @entity4 f - 1 document , ' active users ' is defined as those micro-bloggers who logged in the system by different means , " he said			1
" i would say that this definition can not reflect the real activities on @entity1			1
for example , a mobile user commonly keeps the app in ' logged in ' state but indeed has no usage at all			0
" in contrast , my figures are calculated on the basis of the very nature of user - generated - content -- that is those who generate original posts			1
i think this is a much better way to indicate social media usage in the @entity103 era			0
" more reposts , more value for internet service watchers , @entity1 's low active - user rate is not entirely a surprise			1
" research has consistently shown that active , original contributors constitute a tiny proportion , typically 1 - 2 % , of any internet service			1
so the figure of 5 % cited in that research is comparatively high , " according to @entity115 , research assistant professor from the @entity116 at @entity117			0
@entity115 pointed to one of the earliest and most often cited studies on the so - called " free - riding " of internet users , where the @entity123 network -- a popular peer - to - peer file - sharing service -- was scrutinized to reveal that 70 % of users share no files , and nearly 50 % of all responses are returned by the top 1 % of sharing hosts			0
he explained that active and original participation on the internet by ordinary users has always been low because people do not primarily go on to these platforms to create content			1
for @entity1 , users specifically join the community to share other users ' interesting posts with their friends , " he added			2
it also just takes a lot of effort for people to create original content			1
" there is a considerable amount of ' social risk ' in creating original content because you ca n't be sure that what you create will be popular or appreciated by others			1
thus the costs far outweigh the benefits , unless you 're passionate enough to write or create something original , you 'll realize that it 's much better to re-post something already out there , " said @entity115			0
as for whether @entity12 's new findings will affect @entity1 's upcoming ipo , @entity115 predicted it would actually confirm @entity1 's influence and value even more			1
" the value of @entity1 comes from having many users re-posting a particular item , " he said			2
" it is the ability to encourage people to re-post content rather than create their own that really matters			0
the company ultimately wields some control as to what becomes popularly shared and gains prominence through its data management			0
a business model based on a tiny proportion of active , original contributors is actually a norm for social media platforms			0
" other @entity1 critics point to larger problems on the company 's horizon			1
@entity180 , author of " @entity181 , " an in - depth look at @entity2 media says that even though he is a user of the micro-blogging service , he wo n't be investing in @entity1 because " there is the sense that @entity1 has passed its prime			0
" most people treat @entity1 as a news source , because they do n't trust traditional media			0
the big question though is whether it can keep up with the times			0
i do n't see how they have done much to innovate beyond knocking off @entity195			0

*independent* research shows 10 million @entity1 users generate nearly all the original content
@entity1 will launch ipo putting the company at a value of $ 3.9 billion
researcher says @entity1 's definition of " active use " is debatable
@entity1 says its own data is more accurate and *refutes* the @entity211 research claims
