-- just a year and a half after making their debut , @entity1 became the first @entity5 team to win a stage at the @entity7 as @entity8 finished ahead of the pack in a tight sprint finish in @entity11			1
a photo finish was needed to separate the @entity5 from @entity14 's @entity13 , after the riders traveled 145.5km from @entity16 to @entity17 for the third and final stage on the island			1
@entity21 's @entity20 -- who won sunday 's stage -- ensured his debut in the famous race , which is celebrating its 100th edition , continued in the brightest vein as he retained the yellow jersey			1
his @entity29 team worked hard to enable the 27 - year - old to cross the line in 19th place and so retain the prestigious jersey -- but the day belonged to the @entity5 newboys			1
" this is a huge win , " @entity8 told the team 's official website			1
" it 's a huge moment for the team			2
we have been so close on so many occasions			0
hopefully it 's the first of many more to come			0
" " i had no idea if i had won			0
i knew it was really close , and i was n't going to celebrate too early			0
@entity13 and i were on the opposite ends of the road and we both threw our bikes			2
" my win was confirmed a few minutes later			0
we 're all pretty ecstatic			0
" @entity13 's second place allowed him to take the green jersey for the best sprinter from @entity53 , the @entity54 who won the opening stage of the race in @entity57 on saturday			1
@entity8 ' victory was his second stage win , having previously achieved the feat in the @entity61 when riding for @entity62 in 2008 , and partly atoned for sprinter @entity64 's failure to take a stage at last year 's race			1
" we had a brilliant first season last year , but we really missed winning a stage on the @entity7 so this year it was a big objective for the team to win a stage and i 'm really happy to have done that , " @entity8 , who won last year 's @entity67 in his home country , said in his post-race press conference			1
making their racing debut in january 2012 , @entity1 were founded the year before with the express intention of becoming @entity5 's first road race cycling team			1
@entity80 's finish also earned better headlines for a team whose bus driver invited ridicule after becoming stuck under the finish arch on the opening day of the tour			2
@entity88 , a @entity89 former cyclist who was on his first day working as the team 's bus driver , was caught on camera with his head in his hands when the incident happened -- with the team later fined $ 2,116 by race organizers			2
" we did n't really find out what happened until we finished the first stage , " said @entity8 , 33			2
" afterwards we saw the footage of the bus being stuck under the finish line , and you can really do nothing but laugh at the situation			0
it was such a bizarre scenario for that to happen			0
" the bus driver did a fantastic job			0
we are all really proud of how he conducted himself in the team ; for sure , he was really embarrassed so we really felt quite sorry for him			0
" tuesday 's team trial in @entity113 could see race favorite @entity114 take the yellow jersey given the strength of @entity118			1
the time for each team will be taken when their fifth rider crosses the line			0
meanwhile , @entity124 of the @entity126 team and @entity128 ' @entity127 became the first two riders to withdraw from this year 's tour after suffering digestive problems and food poisoning respectively .			2
