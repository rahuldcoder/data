@entity0 -- at the gadget industry 's annual crystal - ball convention , laptops look more like products of @entity6 than @entity7			1
with sales of budget laptops plummeting , computer makers are swinging the pendulum toward sleeker , metallic and pricier portable pcs that they 're calling @entity14			1
many of these were shown for the first time here this week at the @entity18			1
most pc giants have committed to building @entity14			1
the laptops typically use flash memory instead of hard drives , have no disc readers in order to stay thin , and weigh less than three pounds			1
some computer makers see @entity14 as an evolution of the laptop in response to demands created by lightweight tablet computers			2
this view is even shared by @entity33 companies that produce tablets of their own			2
" we have learned a lot from the tablet , " @entity38 ceo @entity37 said in an interview			2
" i do n't think the desktop will die			2
" similarly , @entity45 ceo @entity44 told an audience in @entity47 , @entity48 , on monday that tablets and smartphones are not a preferable way to browse the @entity52 compared to computers			2
@entity45 has not had success in the smartphone market and failed in its brief foray into tablets , though the company plans to return this year , @entity54 reports			2
@entity38 , the second - largest pc maker , makes tablets based on @entity63 's @entity62 software but has not had much success with them			1
" the tablet is a niche market , " @entity37 said			2
" people still can not give up the keyboard and the larger screen			2
" @entity14 often draw comparisons to @entity73 's @entity72 , which sells well in spite of the @entity76 's continued dominance of the tablet computing market			0
@entity73 is expected to increase its sales of that line of laptops to 8.9 million next year , but competitors are expected to sell about 10 million @entity14 , according to @entity83 analyst @entity82			1
the @entity14 's prospects for bolstering the pc industry come at an opportune time			1
global shipments of pcs fell 1.4 % compared to the same three - month period last year , according to industry research firm @entity88			0
the rare decline comes amid a slowdown in computer demand from the @entity93 and @entity94 , the @entity88 report said			0
companies such as @entity45 and @entity96 , the third - and fourth - largest @entity33 vendors respectively , were major proponents of netbooks and happened to be among those hit the hardest			0
analysts have suggested that the past success of netbooks was a fad born in a bleaker economy and that consumers are now turning away from lower - quality equipment			0
@entity107 plans to take a cautious approach rather than throwing its support behind the emerging @entity14 trend , fared @entity111 , the company 's product chief , said in an interview			0
@entity107 had sold cellular - equipped netbooks at its stores but got burned when customer interest evaporated			0
" instead of jumping in and being a first mover , sometimes be a follower , " @entity111 said			0
yet , the computer industry is embracing the @entity14 , and at @entity18 , the laptops have been met with enthusiasm			1
@entity122 announced that the @entity123 will arrive in stores on february 8 costing $ 1,400			0
the 14 - inch laptop has reflective , black @entity126 on its lid and weighs less than four pounds			0
@entity38 showed off several new @entity14 at @entity18			1
all laptops are poised to be like @entity14 in the future , said @entity37 , the @entity38 ceo			1
however , " the price is the main obstacle , " he said			0
the @entity133 from @entity38 , typically a bargain brand in the @entity93 , won some fans at @entity18 despite its $ 1,200 price tag			1
the laptop 's screen can bend backwards creating a stand for watching video or transforming into a traditional touchscreen tablet			0
it will be available in the second half of the year , after the launch of @entity146 's @entity145 , @entity37 said			0
@entity45 's @entity14 may be the most practical option for many consumers			0
the @entity149 has an aluminum lid and weighs about three pounds			0
it won major praise for its price , $ 999 , and overall features , which includes the ability to download e-mail while the laptop is in sleep mode			0
@entity159 , the mobile chip maker that will enter the pc market this year when @entity146 adopts its architecture in @entity145 , welcomes the move toward slimmer computers			1
but the @entity14 is a creation of @entity166 , a competitor of @entity159			1
" @entity14 is really just a marketing concept built around the success of @entity73 's fashionable products , " @entity159 ceo @entity168 said in an interview			0
@entity159 was created as a joint venture in 1990 that included @entity73 , which now uses arm chips in the @entity174 and @entity76 , though not in laptops			2
@entity166 had pressed its partners to invest in lighter , high - end laptops , and those negotiations are now paying off			1
to promote @entity14 at its @entity18 news conference , @entity166 brought on @entity181 band member @entity180 , who described @entity14 as " the new ghetto blaster			1

**ultrabooks** have *drummed* up buzz at @entity18
**ultrabooks** are slimmer , lighter and metallic laptops
the initiative is being led by @entity166 , the pc chip maker
