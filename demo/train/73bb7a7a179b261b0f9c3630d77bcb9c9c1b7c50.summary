@entity0 , @entity1 -- the 60th anniversary of @entity5 's accession to the @entity7 throne marks a major milestone in the remarkable life of a monarch who , though reluctantly thrust into the spotlight at a young age , has won almost universal praise for her steadfast dedication to duty			1
her long reign ( second only to @entity5 @entity17 's ) has seen @entity7 transformed from a war - weary declining imperial power into its modern incarnation as a member state of the @entity22 that rarely looks to its monarch for leadership , but still holds her in high esteem			1
and while it has witnessed its fair share of joy -- not least the recent marriage of the queen 's grandson @entity30 to @entity32 -- @entity5 's rule has also weathered many storms , both public and personal , as the monarchy has tried to keep pace with changing times			1
@entity38 was born in 1926 , the first child of the @entity40 and @entity41			1
she did not become heiress presumptive to the throne until 1937 when her father was crowned @entity45 after the scandalous abdication of his older brother -- events recently dramatized in the @entity50 - winning film " @entity51			1
" as @entity52 erupted , @entity5 was quietly groomed for statehood			1
while living out the blitz on @entity0 in nearby @entity55 , she was privately tutored in matters of constitution by @entity58 , an eccentric yet respected teacher who reputedly kept a pet raven in his study			0
she began making tentative steps to public life in 1940 when , aged 14 , she made her first radio broadcast : a speech to children displaced by conflict			2
at 16 she was made an honorary colonel of the @entity68 , a @entity7 army infantry regiment			0
@entity69 offered her certain freedoms beyond the constraints of royal life			0
in 1945 she joined the @entity73 , and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles			0
when victory was declared in @entity79 , a uniformed @entity5 mingled with jubilant crowds outside @entity81			2
@entity5 celebrates 60 years on throne @entity84 brought the return of lieutenant prince @entity86 , a handsome young naval officer who had , by all accounts , had won her heart when she was just 13			1
the pair married in @entity89 in 1947			0
their first son , @entity90 , was born just over a year later			2
with her father 's health in rapid decline , @entity5 began accepting more official duties , taking his place at the annual trooping the color military parade in 1949			1
in 1952 , when @entity5 and @entity86 were on an official trip to @entity101 , news came of her father 's death			1
the next decade saw the queen settle into her role			2
after her 1953 coronation , she embarked on numerous official trips , oversaw state openings of parliament , welcomed visiting leaders such as president @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 , and toured a coal mine			0
in 1964 , the queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son @entity118 joined @entity90 and fellow siblings @entity119 and @entity121			2
there was , however , barely any let up in her busy schedule			0
by the arrival of her third decade on the throne , she was in her element			2
prince @entity90 was embarking on a military career , @entity119 , an acclaimed horsewoman , was married -- drawing huge crowds of well wishers			0
girls given equal rights to @entity7 throne under law changes while indulging in her own equestrian pursuits , she continued to throw herself into public life , clocking up dozens of overseas trips and official visits around the @entity7 -- one of which in 1976 saw her become one of the first people to send an email ( she continues to champion new technology today )			1
there were family problems in 1976 when her sister 's marriage collapsed and constitutional problems with growing debate among @entity152 countries about the role of the monarch , but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977			1
another royal wedding followed in 1981 when prince @entity90 married lady @entity160 at @entity0 's @entity161			0
millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television , happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the queen 's life			2
the queen 's 40th year on the throne , 1992 , marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart			1
princess @entity119 and @entity173 divorced , @entity90 and @entity160 separated after claims of infidelities while @entity41 was photographed topless with an @entity177 financial manager			0
to cap it all , a huge fire ripped through @entity55 causing major structural damage			0
in the wake of the blaze , a furore broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration			0
" 1992 is not a year on which i shall look back with undiluted pleasure , " the queen said in a speech later that year			1
" in the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents , it has turned out to be an annus horribilis			0
" @entity32 has graduated as ' fully fledged ' royal these problems overshadowed the queen as she made an historic visit to meet @entity199 in 1995 , but criticism reached new heights in the wake of @entity160 's tragic death in 1997 when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread outpourings of grief			1
this marked a turning point			0
after days of silence , the queen returned to @entity0 , talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from @entity160 's life			2
the gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away			0
after @entity160 , the queen 's popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer , more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family			1
this was evident in 2005 when , to public approval , she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of @entity90 and @entity226			0
the queen 's most recent decade as monarch has largely been one of celebration			1
in 2006 , she marked her 80th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world			0
she has witnessed both her grandsons graduate as military officers and , of course , she oversaw the marriage of prince @entity30 and @entity32 , the woman who -- when her husband eventually inherits the throne to become king -- will succeed her as @entity7 's next queen			1
