@entity1 house speaker @entity0 on wednesday confirmed @entity4 @entity3 are filing a lawsuit against @entity7 's executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally			1
" the president 's overreach when he took executive action to deal with the immigration problems in our country , frankly , in my view , is a violation of our @entity21 , " he said in an interview on @entity11			2
" this is n't about immigration , " he said			0
" this is the president violating the @entity21 , violating his oath of office , and frankly , not upholding the rule of law			0
" @entity0 had told @entity28 of the planned lawsuit during their closed - door meeting on tuesday			2
the move comes as @entity4 leadership struggles to round up support for a border security bill they planned to vote on this week , in part due to conservative opposition			0
conservatives have expressed frustration that leadership has n't done enough to oppose @entity7 's unilateral action on immigration			1
@entity0 insisted during the interview that the bill will ultimately pass			2
but while the lawsuit may help quell some of those complaints , it 's unlikely to ultimately have much impact on deportations			0
@entity0 turned to a similar tactic on @entity50 , bringing a lawsuit against the administration for delaying the employer mandate that remains stalled in court			2
@entity4 spokesman @entity55 said the administration believes @entity7 was acting well within his power when he issued the order on deportations			0
" @entity4 @entity3 seem to be relying more and more on the courts these days to challenge the president 's authority , " @entity60 said at wednesday 's daily press briefing			2
" we believe that we acted within the full bounds of authority enshrined to the executive branch , and we 'll be defending that			0
" @entity0 also defended his decision to invite @entity71 prime minister @entity70 to address the @entity4 in march , without letting the @entity4 know in advance , a move that 's drawn widespread criticism from even pro-israel groups			1
see also : @entity7 says @entity70 's visit is too close to election for a meeting " the @entity71 prime minister can also talk with some expertise about the growing threat of radical @entity83 , " @entity0 said			1
" we 've got a serious problem in the world and the president just wants to act like it 's going to just disappear			0
and so as a co-equal branch of our government , i do n't have any problem at all in doing what i did to invite the prime minister to come to @entity93 and address those concerns			1
" @entity70 is expected to lobby @entity93 to pass new sanctions on @entity96 , putting him squarely at odds with @entity7			1
the president said during a wednesday interview with @entity2 's @entity100 that he had n't heard " a persuasive rebuttal of my argument that we crafted very effective sanctions against @entity96 specifically to bring them to the negotiations table			0
" @entity7 also told @entity100 that he wo n't be meeting with @entity70 when he comes because " our general policy is , we do n't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election			1
" but @entity0 said there 's clear " antipathy " from the @entity4 towards @entity70			1
" they do n't even try to hide it , " he said			0
@entity0 also said @entity4 @entity3 will eventually offer an alternative to the health care reform law , and that he himself expects to remain speaker — despite facing another conservative coup attempt — for quite some time			1
" i 'll be here for a while , " he said .			0
