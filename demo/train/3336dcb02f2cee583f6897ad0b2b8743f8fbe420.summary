-- news outlets reported this week that legendary broadcaster @entity2 never amended his will to include @entity4 , who had been his girlfriend for the last four years of his life			0
@entity2 's daughter said the newsman never planned to leave @entity9 , a former opera singer and older sister of @entity12 , any sort of inheritance , but either way , wills are back in the news			1
@entity17 left her dog trouble $ 12 million dollars in her will			1
what better time to look at some of the most bizarre codicils ever written ? 1			1
@entity17 the notoriously egomaniacal hotelier famously left $ 12 million to her @entity23 , @entity24 , while entirely cutting two of her grandchildren out of her will ( for " reasons which are known to them " )			1
her other two grandchildren did n't get off the hook entirely ; their inheritances were contingent upon their regularly making visits to their father 's grave , where they would have to sign a registration book to prove they had shown up			1
@entity38 do n't think @entity39 is the richest pooch on the block			0
when @entity38 , a @entity43 countess , died in 1991 , she left her entire $ 80 - million estate to her dog , @entity46			1
@entity47 the 18th - and - 19th - century social philosopher left the world a rather odd bequest in his will : his preserved , clothed body			1
no one 's quite sure what @entity47 was getting at with this " gift , " but since his 1832 death his clothed skeleton -- topped with a wax model of @entity47 's head -- has been preserved in a wood - and - glass cabinet known as the @entity47			0
it now resides at @entity62 and is occasionally moved so @entity47 can " attend " meetings			0
@entity47 did n't want for the @entity47 to feature a wax head ; he actually carried around the glass eyes he wanted used in his preserved face for years before his death			0
however , the preservation process distorted his face , so the wax replica had to stand in			0
for many years @entity47 's real head sat between his feet in the @entity47 , but it was such a target for pranksters that it eventually had to be locked away			0

@entity79 @entity80 , a @entity83 socialite and oil heiress , died when she was just 37 years old and requested that she be buried " in my lace nightgown ... in my @entity85 , with the seat slanted comfortably			1
" her family buried @entity80 in her powder - blue 1964 @entity88 , then covered the car with cement to deter car thieves			1
good call : nice examples of that year 's @entity88 can now sell for well over $ 300,000			0
@entity94 the @entity96 aristocrat was a childless bachelor , so he divvied up his estate by picking 70 names at random from the @entity101 phone book in 1988			1
when he died 13 years later , his attorneys notified the unsuspecting beneficiaries that they stood to inherit their benefactor 's cash , his home , and his car			0
@entity108 the @entity110 attorney died a childless bachelor , but he left $ 568,106 to the mother who gave birth to the most children in @entity115 in the 10 years following his 1928 death			2
this bequest prompted what @entity110 called " the @entity121 " as mothers raced to win the fortune			0
finally , in 1938 four winners split the prize after giving birth to nine babies apiece			0

@entity128 the @entity43 poet left his entire fortune to his wife , but with one catch : she had to remarry " because then there will be at least one man to regret my death			2
@entity136 @entity136 , a 19th - century @entity138 hatter , left a rather macabre bequest to a friend -- a pair of drums made from @entity136 's skin			2
the friend received further instructions to go to @entity146 each june 17th and play " @entity147 " on the drums			0
@entity148 @entity149 , an @entity150 lawyer who died in 1930 , must have had some pretty bad experiences with women			1
when he died he left his daughter a measly five bucks , and his wife got nothing			2
he stipulated that the rest of his $ 100,000 estate be put in a trust for 75 years , then used to create the @entity158			2
the library would have no feminine decorations , no books or magazine articles by female authors , and was required to have " no women admitted " carved into the stone over the entrance			1
@entity167 when the celebrated author died , he left his friend @entity169 his birthday			2
@entity169 had previously complained to @entity167 about the inconvenience of being born on @entity172 , so the writer left her november 13th as a new birthday provided she take care of it with " moderation and humanity ... the said birthday not being so young as it once was			1
@entity180 it 's not clear how he originally made 200,000 pounds , but when @entity180 died in 1862 , he left his substantial fortune to his two sons on the condition that neither sullied his lip with a mustache			2
@entity187 when longtime comic book writer and editor @entity187 died in 1996 , fans of the @entity190 icon probably thought they 'd seen the last of the former @entity193 writer			1
@entity187 had other ideas , though			0
he requested that his ashes be mixed into the ink used to print the first trade paperback anthology of @entity198 , another one of his landmark creations			1
