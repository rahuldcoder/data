-- @entity2 's @entity1 , one of the first @entity4 leaders to call for @entity6 president @entity5 to step down , told @entity0 the attack on wednesday that killed members of @entity5 's inner circle is a " tremendous blow to the regime			1
" but the king cautioned that he did not think the attack meant @entity5 's regime was about to crumble immediately			1
the explosion , which a rebel leader said was detonated by remote control , killed defense minister @entity17 ; deputy defense minister @entity19 -- @entity5 's brother - in - law ; and @entity21 , @entity5 's security adviser and assistant vice president , the state tv reports said			2
interior minister @entity23 was injured in the blast , state television said , adding that he " is in good health and that his condition is stable			0
" " this was a tremendous blow to the regime but again , @entity33 has shown its resilience , so i think maybe we need to keep this in perspective , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity29			2
" although this is a blow , i 'm sure the regime will continue to show fortitude at least in the near future			0
" the king said the attack shows " cracks " in the regime , but his larger concern is the growing sectarian violence and whether it may lead to all - out civil war			1
getting to know @entity6 's first family he said the danger of civil war is increasing , and it is @entity5 's last chance to try to stop that from happening			1
" if it breaks down , if civil order breaks down to the point of no return , it will take years to fix @entity6			1
i have a feeling we 're seeing the signs of that			0
the only people that can bring us back from that brink is the president and the regime			0
this is the last chance they have			0
" the king said the international community is continuing to pursue all options involving a political transition , but that recent events made him concerned about whether they could work			0
" i think , as we continue to pursue the political option , the realities on the ground may have overtaken us , " he said			0
" therefore i think the clock is ticking			0
i think we should continue to give politics its due , but if we have n't already passed that window , i think we 're getting very close to a ( civil war )			1
" @entity1 said he and other leaders are concerned about @entity6 's chemical weapons			1
" one of the worst - case scenarios , as we are trying to look for political solutions , would be if some of those chemical stockpiles would fall into unfriendly hands , " he said			2
what we need to know about @entity6 @entity2 's leader said that the big concern is whether the weapons could fall into the hands of groups like @entity96 , which he said he believes is operating in parts of @entity6			1
and he said not knowing who exactly is on which side complicates matters , including discussions of arming the rebels			0
@entity29 asked the king whether he thought it would be acceptable for @entity5 to flee to another country or if he wanted him to be tried for war crimes			2
" if @entity5 leaving the scene and exiting @entity6 brings a stop to the violence and creates a political transition -- that 's a lesser of evils , " he said			1
@entity1 said the international community must consider that , if @entity5 were to leave , questions would arise over who would replace him and how that might affect the restoration of order in @entity6			1
" it 's not so much the individual , it 's the system , and does the system allow for political transition ? " @entity1 said			2
" and that 's where i have my doubts			0
" next for @entity6 : showdown or stalemate ? watch @entity128 with @entity29 weekdays at 4pm to 6pm et and saturdays at 6pm et. for the latest from @entity129 .			0
