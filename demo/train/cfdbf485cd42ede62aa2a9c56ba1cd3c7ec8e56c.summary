-- you already have your next credit card			0
it 's sitting in your front pocket			2
people have possessed the ability to spend and send money with their smartphones for years , but mobile payments have yet to take off in a big way			1
plastic and cash are still the preferred modes of buying stuff -- by a long shot			0
but four recent events suggest that mobile payments are about to take off in a big way			1
this week , investors pumped $ 150 million into @entity20 , the mobile - payments company that lets people turn their smartphones into virtual cash registers			1
the investment values the company at $ 6 billion			1
last week , @entity26 opted to spin off payments service @entity28			0
a big part of the reason : @entity28 has been held back by its parent company , and the move is expected to free @entity28 to increase its mobile payments presence			1
@entity34 is experimenting with a one - touch payments system , and this week @entity36 reported that @entity34 is about to release a peer - to - peer money transfer feature in its @entity39 app. 4			1
and then there 's the big kahuna : @entity42			1
set to be released later this month , @entity42 will let @entity45 and @entity44 users make payments at participating retailers simply by using their phones ' fingerprint scanner then holding the phone up to a scanner			1
retailers who have already signed up include @entity54 's , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			1
more than 70 % of @entity61 adults have smartphones , and more than one in five have already used a " mobile wallet " in the past 90 days , according to @entity64 , executive vice president and research director at @entity66			0
more than half of mobile purchasers bought physical goods with their phones			0
the trend lines are clear			0
and as more apps and smartphones push mobile payments , consumers will become increasingly willing to ditch plastic for their phones			2
" recent history would dictate that pretty much anything that has required a physical world medium for delivery -- cds , film cameras , the @entity85 -- have been all but replaced by a digital equivalent , " said @entity82 , a senior analyst at @entity66			0
what 's not clear is which form of mobile payments will become dominant			2
@entity20 , for instance , is hedging its bets by selling a credit card reader and a mobile app that lets you pay without taking your card out of your wallet			2
although the company was a mobile - payments innovator , products like @entity42 's could make its most visible product , a reader for credit cards , obsolete			1
" this wo n't happen for many years , but in a new world where @entity42 is seen as the shiniest new thing -- where the plastic cards have the ability to be physically removed from the payment process -- @entity20 has lost quite a lot of its sheen , " @entity82 said			1
@entity64 said she believes mobile users up to age 45 will make the transition to mobile payments relatively seamlessly			2
as to the others , she expects the transition to be slower , but to eventually come the same way other digital adoptions have -- with a nudge from the younger folks around them			0
" most likely , it will be the sons and daughters who sweet talk and cajole the parents ...			0
" @entity126 -- i need the tuition check now , please			0
just send it to me using mobile p2p			0
" " that 's how teens got parents to text -- just so parents could talk to their teens on the phone , they learned in self - defense			2
now it 's the next step			0

experts say mobile - phone payments may be here to stay
