@entity0 -- a late evening meeting between president @entity3 and the leaders of the @entity5 and @entity6 failed to reach agreement wednesday on a spending plan to avert a government shutdown , but all the participants said progress was made and talks would continue			1
if there is no deal by midnight friday , when the current spending authorization measure expires , parts of the government will close down			1
@entity3 called the 90 - minute talks with @entity5 speaker @entity19 , @entity20 , and senate majority leader @entity21 , @entity22 , " constructive " and he said they narrowed and clarified the outstanding issues			1
" i remain confident that if we 're serious about getting something done , we should be able to complete a deal and get it passed and avert a shutdown , " @entity3 said in brief remarks to reporters			1
" but it 's going to require a sufficient sense of urgency from all parties involved " to prevent a shutdown that " could have real effects on everyday @entity38			1
" both @entity21 and @entity19 told reporters in their own brief comments that the meeting made progress in narrowing their differences , and that their staffs would work through the night to try to reach further consensus			1
" i have confidence we can get this done , " said @entity21 , who criticized @entity19 and @entity46 earlier in the day for intransigence			1
" we 're not there yet			0
" @entity19 , standing next to @entity21 , said " we do have some honest differences , " and he emphasized there was no agreement on either a specific figure for spending cuts for the rest of the current fiscal year or on policy issues that the @entity46 want included in the measure , such as specifically prohibiting funding for abortions			1
" no one wants the government to shut down , " @entity19 said			1
time : are we headed for a shutdown ? @entity3 called the meeting because of a lack of progress in negotiations during the day , @entity5 spokesman @entity66 told reporters			1
a @entity5 source familiar with the situation , speaking on condition of not being identified , told @entity1 that " there was almost no progress made today			1
" " there would n't be a meeting if it was n't a necessary step at this stage in the process , " the source said of the evening talks			1
@entity19 announced earlier that the @entity85 will try to buy more time for negotiators by voting thursday on a one - week government funding bill that would cut spending by $ 12 billion and fund the @entity90 for the remainder of the current fiscal year			1
@entity46 budget chief calls for $ 6.2 trillion in spending cuts " republicans have no interest in shutting down the government , " @entity19 insisted			1
but " we are going to fight for as many spending cuts as we can get			0
" @entity46 leaders said they were prepared to pass the bill on a strict party - line vote if necessary			2
democrats , insistent they have already met the @entity46 more than halfway in negotiations , oppose such a measure , and it was considered unlikely to clear the @entity6			2
in two speeches on the @entity6 floor during the day , @entity21 accused @entity46 leaders of being unwilling to compromise because of pressure from the conservative @entity110 movement to cut deeper and include provisions on political issues			1
" we meet them halfway , they say no. we meet them all the way , they say no , " @entity21 said , calling the latest proposed extension from the @entity5 a " diversion " from making " tough choices " to settle the matter			1
" the @entity46 leadership has the @entity110 screaming so loudly in its right ear that it ca n't hear what the vast majority of the country demands , " @entity21 said			2
@entity110 : bring on a government shutdown @entity3 , on the road in @entity126 , declared that he did n't " want to see @entity0 politics stand in the way of @entity38 's progress			1
" " at a time when you are struggling to pay your bills and meet your responsibilities , the least we can do ( is ) meet our responsibilities to produce a budget , " he said			0
" that 's not too much to ask for			2
" @entity3 blamed the @entity46 for using the budget crisis to push provisions relating to hot - button issues such as abortion , health care and the environment			2
debates over those issues were holding back talks , he said			0
@entity19 has insisted his caucus will not back down on those issues			2
he proposed the one - week extension after meeting with his @entity46 @entity5 colleagues			1
reporters outside heard applause from within the room at one point			0
@entity46 sources told @entity1 the applause was for @entity19 when he choked up while thanking his colleagues for their support on the issue			2
government shutdown : @entity5 details consequences behind all the rhetorical bluster and bombast , however , negotiations continued unabated			1
@entity3 talked to both @entity19 and @entity21 over the phone earlier wednesday , and @entity167 and @entity46 leadership staffers continued meeting on @entity169 in an attempt to break the stalemate			1
@entity3 met tuesday with congressional leaders including @entity21 and @entity19 , and warned then that he would seek further meetings if the negotiations yielded insufficient progress			1
as for the overall numbers , negotiators were looking at a package of cuts for the rest of the fiscal year that would probably total a bit over $ 33 billion but less than $ 40 billion , according to a @entity167 congressional source			0
the fiscal year ends september 30			0
@entity184 : looming government shutdown the @entity46 - led @entity5 has passed a bill that included $ 61 billion in cuts from current spending levels , but it was rejected by the @entity189 - controlled @entity6			1
two previous extensions of the government spending resolution have included $ 10 billion in cuts			0
in response to the looming budget deadline , the @entity38 @entity193 posted information on its website tuesday about how a shutdown would affect federal employees			2
the posting said that most federal workers paid with funds appropriated by @entity203 would go on temporary furlough in the event of a shutdown			2
it would be up to @entity203 to decide if furloughed workers get paid for the time missed when the shutdown ends , the posting said			0
health benefits continue if the shutdown lasts for less than a year , it said			0
if there is a shutdown , an estimated 800,000 government workers will likely be asked to stay home , according to senior administration officials			2
among other things , the @entity221 will stop processing paper tax returns , the @entity220 will stop making loans and federal home loan guarantees will be put on hold			0
@entity38 troops would be paid through friday , but after that , paychecks to members of the military , including those in war zones , would stop			0
the @entity234 would stop accepting new patients and would put clinical trials on hold			0
a @entity239 spokesperson said on condition of not being identified that " critical national security , law enforcement and prison operations " would continue in the event of a shutdown			0
political ticker : nation split on shutdown blame game " all @entity251 personnel in the field will continue to work , and the department will be ready to respond to any and all contingencies that might arise during this time , " the @entity249 spokesperson said			0
however , some functions including civil litigation , outreach to crime victims and grant processing would be stopped or curtailed , the spokesperson said			0
congressional veterans from both sides of the aisle indicated wednesday a strong desire to avoid a shutdown			1
" my concern with a shutdown is , what is our long - term goal ? what are we trying to achieve ? " asked rep. @entity272 , @entity273 , a senior member of the @entity274			0
" if it is repeal @entity277 ( the health care reform law enacted last year ) , do we think in two weeks or a month @entity3 's going to go , ' you guys were right , ' and sign onto it ? i do n't think so			1
so you better look at what your goals are and what you 're willing to accept , or do n't do it			0
" sen. @entity287 , @entity288 , said a shutdown would mean " enormous negative consequences , and i think we 're going to rue the day the way we 're functioning here			0
we need to come to the table and ... act like rational human beings			0
" republicans , under pressure from the conservative @entity110 movement to make deep cuts that would reduce the size of government , blame @entity167 for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both congressional chambers			2
they also say that @entity3 and his party are ignoring the peril of the rising federal deficits and national debt			1
@entity167 contend that the $ 61 billion in spending cuts in the @entity5 bill would harm the economic recovery and slash education and innovation programs essential for continued growth			2
@entity3 and @entity21 both insist that @entity167 have agreed to more than 50 % of the spending cuts sought by @entity46 , which they said should be sufficient for a compromise on an issue that has little overall effect on the deficit and debt issues			1
the budget brinkmanship shows the political stakes of the situation , with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what 's right for the country			0
@entity19 has cast aside assertions by @entity167 that they had agreed to more than half the cuts sought by the @entity46 , saying the @entity167 used " smoke and mirrors to get there			2
" a senior @entity167 source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs , known in appropriations parlance as " changes in mandatory spending " or @entity339 , should be part of spending cuts			0
examples of mandatory spending programs include @entity344 , the @entity345 and some types of highway funding			0
such programs are funded for multiple years at a time , with the spending set for the time period covered , exempt from congressional authorization each year			0
@entity167 sources have said they want about half the overall cuts in this spending bill to come from mandatory spending programs , and they have proposed the necessary reductions in programs at the @entity38 @entity356 , the @entity239 and the @entity357 , and in @entity344			0
republicans , who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government , note that reducing the spending in a mandatory program for one year does n't prevent the amount from returning to its original level the following year			0
@entity1 's @entity368 , @entity369 , @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 and @entity373 contributed to this report			0
