on the day the new @entity2 clinic in @entity3 opened , ambulances waited outside			1
inside the ambulances were desperately ill patients who had come for treatment but instead would be left to lie on the ground as others walked by			1
the @entity8 and its 120 @entity2 treatment beds opened to fanfare sunday afternoon , with a ceremony attended by international health officials and @entity3 leaders			1
but the clinic , located on @entity15 near @entity16 , the capital , did not appear to be ready for the number of patients that quickly flooded its doors			1
some lay motionless on the floors of the ambulances outside the center , too weak to get out			1
they had traveled for hours after being turned away from other hospitals in the area			2
no one from inside the hospital arrived to offer assistance			2
one man opened his eyes weakly			0
" try to come down and walk a little , " a worker told him			0
" i 'm too tired , " the man said			0
but he summoned his strength and got out of the ambulance -- and immediately collapsed on the ground			1
a little boy tried to walk out of another ambulance , but he too collapsed			0
the two lay on the rocky ground just a few feet apart			2
the boy was completely naked and the man was naked from the waist down -- ebola patients often do n't wear pants because of the intense diarrhea caused by the virus			2
" get up and go inside , " workers told the boy			0
" you 'll only get food if you go inside			0
" " let him rest , " another worker said , and they agreed to let him stay where he lay			0
when asked why no one from the hospital was helping them get inside , a hospital worker said staff was inside suiting up in protective gear			0
@entity2 spreads through contact with bodily fluids from an infected patient			1
more than 2,800 people have died over the past six months in @entity64			0
five countries have reported @entity2 cases , but @entity3 , @entity67 and @entity68 have carried the largest burden			1
deadliest outbreak : what you need to know @entity8 is supported by the government of @entity3 and the @entity74			1
when shown @entity77 's video of the patients collapsing , a @entity74 representative was horrified , but said the patients should n't have waited until they were so sick to seek help			2
" i think the lesson here is that people come too late , " said @entity81			0
but many @entity2 patients do n't wait by choice -- there 's an estimated shortage of 700 @entity2 beds in @entity16 alone , and patients often wander from hospital to hospital , only to be turned away			1
" i know , i know , " said @entity81 , @entity74 's country representative in @entity3			1
" that 's why we need to increase capacity			0
" @entity81 said he would try to find out why hospital workers did n't come help the patients			2
he said he hopes any opening - day difficulties wo n't discourage patients from seeking help -- he does n't want them to stay home			1
" it 's shocking , " he said			0
" this is exactly what we should try to avoid in the future			0
