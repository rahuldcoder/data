@entity0 -- @entity2 want their version of the @entity4			2
even the @entity5 will do			0
and so they have voted for a man who promises more for less : more development and growth , with less government and red tape			0
for @entity2 's 1.27 billion dreamers , their new prime minister @entity12 is a known commodity			1
his simple mandate is to do for @entity2 what he has done for the north western state of @entity19 in the last 12 years : conjure up @entity21 - levels of growth and prosperity			2
but for @entity12 's counterparts in @entity26 , @entity27 , and @entity28 , @entity2 's new leader is considered a wildcard			1
will he be aggressive , or a dove ? what is his foreign policy ? does he have a vision for @entity2 's place in the world ? there 's very little to go on			1
@entity12 has never addressed foreign policy at length ; @entity2 campaigns rarely involve debates on world affairs			1
few in @entity0 seem to have a clear sense of his plans			0
when i spoke with @entity46 , a former @entity2 minister now being touted as a top candidate to head the finance ministry , i got a telling response : " anyone who says they know @entity12 's plans , does n't really know anything			1
the ones who know wo n't talk			0
" so let 's start with the few signals we 've received from the man himself			0
reaching out to neighbors @entity12 has certainly begun with a flourish , scoring a coup in getting his @entity64 counterpart to attend his swearing - in			2
on monday , @entity66 became the first @entity64 prime minister in history to attend an @entity2 prime minister 's inauguration			1
the two men were photographed exchanging a firm handshake			0
@entity12 later tweeted that @entity66 had " shared some very emotional things " during their meeting			0
he elaborated with a story about how @entity66 's mother became emotional when watching @entity12 's mother offering him sweets			2
( read the series of tweets here ) @entity12 's @entity83 account also highlights his early attempts to strengthen ties with his new counterparts			2
after his election , he announced to his 4.38 million followers congratulatory messages from @entity91 president @entity90 , @entity93 's @entity92 , @entity95 chancellor @entity94 , @entity97 's @entity96 , @entity99 's @entity98 , as well as leaders from @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and more			0
@entity105 got an especially lavish mention : " personally , i have a wonderful experience of working with @entity105 as [ chief minister of @entity19			0
] , " @entity12 tweeted			0
" i am sure we will take @entity2 - @entity105 ties to newer heights			0
" @entity105 's @entity112 follows only three people on @entity83 -- @entity12 , of course , is one of them			2
@entity83 diplomacy is not just about rhetoric -- there have been some early results , too			0
@entity121 president @entity120 tweeted sunday : " as a goodwill measure on the occasion of @ narendramodi 's swearing - in , president instructs officials to release @entity2 fishermen in custody			2
" none of the above sheds light on what kind of vision @entity12 has , but it is indeed a refreshing marker of proactive engagement -- the opposite of @entity2 's foreign policy in years gone by			1
in an excellent essay in foreign affairs last month , @entity138 described how @entity2 foreign policy in the last 50 years has been characterized " more by continuity than by change " -- irrespective of the party in power			1
' non-alignment ' @entity2 's relations with major powers have stayed stable			1
broadly , there are two reasons behind this trend			0
one is @entity2 's historic pledge of " non-alignment " : the country 's first prime minister @entity154 founded the global @entity156 , a group of states agreeing to not align with major powers			1
the other reason is @entity2 's neglect of foreign policy planning from the very top : civil servants get little - to - no instruction from the prime minister 's office , and so have great levels of autonomy and wield significant power			1
the result is no clear vision from @entity0 , and a general stasis in @entity2 's relations with the world			1
it has often been pointed out that @entity2 has fewer diplomats than @entity176 , a country with a population 1/250th the size of @entity2 's			1
@entity2 has consistently punched below its weight despite aspiring to be a global player			0
will @entity12 change these trends ? again , it is difficult to read his mind			2
but turn again to what @entity12 has actually said			0
the writer @entity185 points out that @entity12 has repeatedly stated that foreign policy begins at home			1
this is not to suggest that @entity12 will be insular			0
instead , his relations with other countries will be driven by business needs and a sense of realism -- perhaps similar , in theory , to @entity21 's relations with @entity197 and @entity198 states			0
many writers and commentators have expressed fears about @entity12 's foreign policy on two main fronts			1
first , that he will channel his brand of @entity206 nationalism into friction with @entity64			0
second , that he will use his prior history with @entity26 -- @entity12 's @entity91 visa was revoked in 2005 over a never - before - used religious freedoms act -- as a reason to snub the world 's biggest economy			2
on both fronts , we have no way of confirming those fears just yet			0
but with each passing day , we are witnessing an evolving @entity12 , a realist whose goal is to grow @entity219 and do business with anyone -- at home or abroad -- who can help achieve that goal			0
@entity12 's real test will be whether he can bring a longer - term vision to @entity2 's foreign policy planning			1
will he keep @entity0 non-aligned ? will he pivot further @entity228 ? will he help fulfil @entity90 's prediction that @entity2 and the @entity91 will form the 21st century 's defining partnership ? only @entity12 knows the answers			1
but if @entity2 foreign policy has so far not been driven by the prime minister 's office , i think we can now expect that strange quirk to change			1
for better or worse , prime minister @entity12 will take charge .			1

@entity2 's new prime minister has promised *citizens* growth and prosperity
what 's less clear is how @entity12 will *approach* foreign policy
@entity12 has wasted no time connecting with other foreign leaders
in the past @entity2 's foreign policy has been more about continuity than change
