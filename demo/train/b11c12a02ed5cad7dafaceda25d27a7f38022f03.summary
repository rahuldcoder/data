-- as @entity2 arrives , eyes turn naturally toward @entity3 , where the @entity4 was supposedly born just over 2,000 years ago			1
countless @entity5 -- some devout , others wedded to force of habit -- arrive at a vast array of churches that represent one of the thousands of known denominations			2
indeed , the @entity11 suggests that over 33,820 denominations can be identified in almost 200 countries			0
that 's a lot of splintering over two millennia ! still , it 's difficult to keep in mind that @entity2 is a religious and not a shopping thing , and retailers deck the halls with whatever it takes to draw you in : candy canes , evergreen wreaths , mangers , images of @entity27 , @entity22 , you name it			1
the loudspeakers in malls throb with lousy holiday @entity31 : " @entity33			2
are you listenin ? " in fact , @entity2 is as much a secular event as a spiritual one , a civil holiday that accounts for over 19 % of yearly retail sales ; that translated to $ 3 trillion in sales last year			1
for purveyors of goods , there is every reason to believe in @entity2			1
but what do @entity5 who take their religion seriously really think about @entity2 ? most of them , i suspect , do n't think about it much			1
they enjoy the lead - up to the day itself -- the sense of expectation -- in the month before @entity2 , a time known as @entity51 , with its special hymns and prayers			1
the rhythms of the so - called @entity55 are heavily dependent on @entity2 , with the 25th of december as a peak of sorts -- a moment of hope that comes at the darkest time of the year , not incidentally related to winter solstice , a calendar moment when the day is shortest , the night longest , at least in the @entity63			1
in fact , midwinter festivals , including @entity65 and @entity66 , were broadly celebrated in ancient @entity68			1
in ancient @entity70 , there was a festival that marked the birth of a child sun - god , @entity74 , whose mother ( called @entity76 ) was a virgin			2
indeed , this child was " laid in a manger , " one of many similarities with the @entity2 story			1
scholars have been all over this , going back to one of the earliest @entity85 writers , @entity86 of @entity87 , who noted the similarities			0
( the details of this connection will be found in a recent book by @entity92 and @entity93 , " @entity94 "			0
) there is just no doubt that ancient cultures felt a strong need to proclaim the season of a new " sun , " the start of the fresh agricultural and astrological season that signaled hope " in the bleak midwinter , " as the beautiful @entity85 hymn puts it well			1
but the earliest @entity85 writer , the @entity108 , whose writings precede the four gospels by decades , seems never to have heard of @entity2			1
although his many famous letters occupy a large space in the @entity113 , @entity108 fails to mention even once the manger in @entity3 , the hovering star , the wise men , angels keeping watch over their flocks by night , @entity121 and @entity122 on the run -- anything that we normally associate with this major church festival			2
why is this ? was the early @entity85 church wholly unaware of the origins of @entity4 ? it 's worth noting that the earliest of the gospels , @entity130 , makes no mention whatsoever of @entity2			1
nor does the fourth gospel , @entity135 , where the only vague allusion to the origins of @entity4 occurs in the opening hymn , where we read : " in the beginning was the @entity141			0
" no manger , no hovering star			0
nothing but this haunting mystical @entity146 hymn about " the @entity141 , " which in @entity146 is logos , one of the least translatable of @entity146 words and one that i would myself translate as " understanding			0
" but there was , among early @entity85 gatherings , a strong need to have a myth of origins , a story about the beginnings of the man who ultimately became the @entity160 , the @entity159			0
probably drawing on @entity164 myths , @entity161 and @entity162 came up with @entity2 stories that have almost nothing in common			1
they ca n't be reconciled , in fact			2
in @entity161 , we get the three kings			0
we get @entity172 issuing an order that all children under a certain age should be killed			0
we get @entity4 being whisked away by his parents to @entity70 , where he remains in hiding until it 's safe to return			0
in @entity162 we get a kinder and gentler @entity2 , with no wise men , no mean @entity172 , no flight to @entity70			2
instead , we get the shepherds keeping a watch over their flocks by night			0
as any @entity185 male would , if born to devout parents , the baby @entity4 was taken to the great @entity186 in @entity187 to be circumcised			0
it 's a lovely story			0
@entity5 did n't celebrate @entity2 in the first two centuries			1
in fact , the major early writers of @entity85 fail to mention the holiday at all , and one of them -- @entity194 -- actually made fun of birth celebrations , regarding such anniversaries as a pagan practice			2
it was n't until the middle of the fourth century that almanacs began to list @entity2 as a celebration			1
as @entity85 moved into @entity203 , the idea of @entity51 as a major season that culminated in @entity2 obviously caught on			2
it linked to various local traditions , in @entity207 and @entity208 and elsewhere			0
there were old @entity211 celebrations associated with the winter solstice that connected to the idea of " @entity214 , " which means " @entity215 , " and these ceremonial occasions involved the burning of a " yule log			1
" brightly decorated trees were also part of the celebration , and this obviously carried over into @entity85 practices			2
the great success of @entity85 in the world had much to do with its ability to assimilate earlier religious traditions wherever it was transplanted , and the @entity2 season must be considered a melange of many ancient and meaningful practices			1
but one must never forget that @entity5 themselves -- and i am one of them -- consider this a holy time , a time of spiritual renewal , a time of the year when darkness opens to the possibility of light			0
whatever the specifics of his birth , @entity4 became the @entity241 for those who follow his path			0
he is , indeed , the @entity4 , and he invites us to a change of heart , a way of overcoming violence in the world with love and grace			0
this is the @entity251 that the gospel writers proclaimed .			0

@entity254 : in the retail rush of @entity2 , *people* do n't *ponder* where holiday came from
he says it *coincides* with winter solstice and other ancient midwinter festivals
he says two gospels do n't mention @entity2 tale and two others do n't get stories *straight*
@entity254 : *christmas* a melange of ancient and meaningful practices
