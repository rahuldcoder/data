-- horror - meister , @entity1 calls @entity3 " perhaps the greatest living @entity5 crime writer			1
" his stories are set in @entity3 ' hometown of @entity8 , but this is not the side of the @entity5 capitol that you see portrayed on tv with white marble monuments , lawyers and lobbyists			1
@entity3 is more interested in working families struggling to get by , the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low - lifes on the edges			1
his crime - writing peers call @entity3 the " undisputed poet " of @entity8 's gritty side			1
the best - selling and award - winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel , " the cut			1
" it 's the first in a new series featuring @entity33 war veteran and private investigator @entity34			1
when he 's not working for a @entity8 defense attorney , @entity34 recovers stolen property for a 40 % cut			1
now , a high - profile crime boss hires @entity34 to find out who 's been stealing from him , and it could turn out to be @entity34 ' biggest payday or an untimely end			1
while @entity3 made his bones in the noir tradition , there 's a definite " western " feel to " @entity46			1
" the new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world			0
it 's peppered with pitch - perfect dialogue and captures the sights , sounds and taste of @entity8 in rich detail			1
in short , @entity3 reads like the real deal			1
@entity3 knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban @entity5 with an ethnically and socially diverse cast			1
in addition to his success as a novelist , @entity3 is a producer and writer for @entity65 's @entity64 - set , " @entity66			1
" he was previously a producer and @entity67 - nominated writer on the hit series " @entity70 " and the miniseries " @entity72			1
" read an excerpt from " @entity46 " @entity0 recently spoke to @entity3 about his new novel			1
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : tell me more about your new character , @entity34			1
is he meant to be representative of the current generation of young @entity5 veterans ? @entity3 : i had met many wounded veterans at @entity83 when i was researching my 2009 novel " @entity85 , " and i continue to be very interested in how returning servicemen and women deal with their new lives back home , and how they 're treated by @entity5			1
at the same time , i noticed that there were an unusual amount of @entity92 with combat experience who had taken jobs as investigators for attorneys here in @entity8 then one day , i had a chance encounter and enlightening conversation with a vet who had lost a leg in @entity33			1
all of these things were knocking on the door of my imagination , telling me to write a novel			0
@entity0 : @entity34 , like a lot of your characters , is not a conventional " good guy			1
" he does some bad things to some bad people in " the cut , " and you allude to some dark events from his past			0
@entity3 : my father was a @entity92 who fought in the @entity116 in @entity117 he was a very tough guy , but after the war , he lived his life in a quiet and reserved manner , because he had nothing to prove			1
i know now that he internalized his war experience			2
i imagined @entity34 to be the same way			1
in the next @entity34 book , more will be revealed			1
@entity0 : " @entity46 " reveals , as do all of your books , a side of @entity8 , we do n't often see portrayed			1
what is it you see in @entity8 that others miss ? @entity3 : i 've just been very interested in the living side of @entity8 , rather than the federal side , since i was a kid			1
i basically go out there and get engaged			0
some of my books are heavily researched in terms of archival work , but this one was all street - level , shoe - leather stuff			2
i am on my bike daily , and most of the locations , warehouses and specific residences from " @entity46 " were found while i was riding			1
on those rides , i took photos and videos from my @entity151			0
@entity8 's an alley town , so it 's particularly conducive to bike reconnaissance			2
@entity34 likes to walk at night ; in one scene , this leads to a violent confrontation in an elevated church parking lot on @entity159 , just behind @entity160			2
i walked that route myself one summer night			0
the kayak scenes were written after i paddled the waters of the upper @entity164			0
when walking or biking was n't practical , i drove my jeep			0
if i wanted to go fast , i took my @entity167			0
@entity0 : you describe the streets , neighborhoods and shops of @entity8 in near map - like detail			2
i 'm pretty sure if i got lost , i could pull out one of your books to find my way back			0
@entity3 : i hope so			2
i 'm leaving a record			0
@entity0 : your books always include great descriptions of food and music			0
i can almost taste the meals the characters eat , hear the music on the jukebox			0
is this as fun to research and write as it is to read ? @entity3 : absolutely			2
i usually buy a bunch of music that fits the book and its characters before i start writing , and give myself an education			0
i can tell you that the restaurant scenes were heavily " researched			0
" when @entity195 and @entity196 asked me to participate in their show , " @entity66 , " i did n't have to think too hard on it			2
@entity64 , food , music ... i was there			2
just because it 's work , does n't mean you ca n't have fun			2
@entity0 : you 're an award - winning writer and producer for " @entity70 " and now " @entity66			1
" how is working for tv different from writing novels ? @entity3 : collaboration versus solitude , of course			2
i actually like working with a bunch of creative people who come together to build something			0
after 10 years , the process still fascinates me			0
when you write for television , you have to come to terms with the fact that what you pen is not yours			0
show runners , directors , actors , editors and costume designers are your co-writers , in a sense , and often they elevate what you do			0
by my first love is writing novels			0
the books are all mine			0
@entity0 : you write about some of your favorite books , movies and music on your website			0
anything you 're reading , watching or listening to right now you 'd like to recommend ? @entity3 : last week , i watched three extraordinary genre movies from , respectively , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 : " 13 assassins , " also " @entity245 " and " @entity246			2
" the last 45 minutes of " @entity247 , " directed by @entity248 , is one of the most stunning extended action sequences ever filmed			0
recently , i re-read my @entity252 library and was reminded that " @entity254 " is one deep , dark book			0
@entity256 's new one , " @entity257 " is a beautiful , dreamlike record			2
@entity8 has seen a reggae and funk resurgence of late			0
in that vein , i recommend @entity264 's debut and the compilation " @entity266 2 " by @entity267			2
@entity0 : what 's next ? can readers look forward to @entity34 's return ? @entity3 : i 'll get started on a new @entity34 book soon			1
in the meantime , i recently finished a novel set in 1972			0
more on that to come			0
watch video of @entity3 reading from " @entity46 "			1
