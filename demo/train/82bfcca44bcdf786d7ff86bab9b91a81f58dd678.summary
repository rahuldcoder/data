@entity0 -- the @entity2 threw its legal weight tuesday behind a @entity5 student whose side business selling foreign - made textbooks got him in trouble with the publisher			2
the justices ruled 6 - 3 that copyrighted works made and purchased abroad can then be resold within the @entity14 without the copyright owner 's permission			1
the ruling is a victory for those who buy and sell books , movies , music , and artwork , and perhaps even furniture , electronics , automobiles , and clothing -- anything that may be considered " intellectual property			1
" storefront and at - home secondary retailers , libraries , artistic venues -- even the local garage sale -- would also be affected			1
justice @entity35 , writing for the majority , said to rule otherwise would create financial chaos , citing public libraries as an example			2
" how can they find , say , the copyright owner of a foreign book , perhaps written decades ago ? " he said			2
" are the libraries to stop circulating or distributing the millions of books in their collections that were printed abroad ? " the legal dispute had attracted interest from the @entity51 administration , media and publishing companies , and a range of consumer and retail groups			1
competing claims of intellectual property and owners ' rights in the electronic age made @entity63 's venture one of the most closely watched business cases at the high court this term			2
he bought textbooks abroad , where the prices are lower , and resold them in the @entity14			1
the justices considered the limits of two key interpretations of copyright law -- the " first sale doctrine " and its complex relationship to foreign distribution rights			1
the first sale doctrine generally gives copyright holders the ability to profit only from the original sale			1
it essentially means once a person lawfully buys a @entity85 lithograph or an @entity87 music cd in the @entity14 , that person then can sell that copyrighted work in the @entity14 without punishment and without having to compensate the original copyright holder			1
it ensures a distribution chain of retail items , library lending , gift giving and rentals for a range of intellectual property			0
that stream of commerce includes secondary markets like flea markets and online resellers @entity104 and @entity105			0
the idea -- upheld by the @entity2 since 1908 -- is that once a copyright holder legally sells a product , the ownership claim is exhausted , giving the buyer the power to resell , destroy , donate , or whatever			1
it 's a limited idea , involving only a buyer 's distribution right , not the power to reproduce that dvd or designer dress for sale			2
the tricky part is whether that first sale doctrine applies to material both manufactured and first purchased outside the @entity14			1
@entity35 said it does : " the upshot is that copyright - related consequences , along with language , context , and interpretative canons , argue strongly against a geographical interpretation			2
" @entity130 , the publishing firm that sued @entity63 , argued it readily sells its products overseas at a cheaper price -- particularly to countries in @entity135 , the @entity136 and @entity137 -- to satisfy an audience that may have less income than in the @entity14 or @entity141			1
such differences in worldwide prices are often exploited by retail and resale firms , especially on high - end luxury and specialized items			0
known as parallel sales or the " gray market " -- foreign - made goods obtained through second - hand sources -- the strategy costs manufacturers tens of billions of dollars a year , according to some business - generated estimates			2
@entity63 came to the @entity14 to study mathematics in 1997 at @entity156 and later pursued doctoral studies at the @entity158			1
to cover tuition and living expenses , he asked family and friends back home to ship him foreign editions of textbooks that often can be bought more cheaply overseas			0
using the computer tag @entity166 , he sold the imported books online in the @entity14 on @entity105			1
court records show he pulled in about $ 1.2 million in revenue , but both sides disagree over how much profit he made			2
his sales included dozens of copies of eight textbooks printed in @entity135 by a @entity130 subsidiary			0
@entity63 's lawyers claim his gross revenue from the @entity130 sales was just $ 37,000			0
the @entity181 publisher has a thriving overseas business			0
its foreign editions typically have a disclaimer : " this book is authorized for sale in @entity141 , @entity135 , @entity188 and the @entity136 only and may not be exported			0
exportation from or importation of this book to another region without the publishers authorization is illegal			0
" the company sued and a federal jury found @entity63 's conduct was willful and ordered him to pay $ 600,000 in damages			0
@entity198 , an attorney with @entity199 hired by the publisher , told @entity1 last year that banning the low - cost versions from the @entity14 helps the global economy			2
" the whole idea of the copyright laws is to provide people with an incentive to create books , movies , or other works of art , " he said			2
" if you take away that incentive , you 're not going to have creators out there doing things that give us pleasure or educate us			0
" members of the entertainment industry said a ruling in their favor was vital in the digital economy , to ensure they can divide their property and distribution rights across the global markets			0
but @entity63 and his owners ' rights supporters worried a slippery slope would quickly occur on a variety of fronts if they lost at the @entity2 : -- domestic manufacturers would have financial incentive to shut down @entity14 plants and produce everything overseas , since they could get a monetary cut and distribution control over every resale			1
@entity63 's lawyers said that would amount to double - dipping , with copyright holders getting paid twice for the same item 's sale			1
-- libraries would have to either have to purge their stacks of every foreign - printed work , pay a royalty , or essentially go out of the public lending service			2
-- @entity14 consumers would lose access to affordable and differentiated goods , and charitable donations would be stifled			1
-- with a global consumer economy now dominated by digital and cloud - based access and transfer of information and entertainment , the cross-border lines would create chaos and uncertainty when it comes to determining where a particular copyrighted good is manufactured and then resold			1
@entity130 , with the @entity263 in support , dismissed those scenarios			0
but @entity266 , a lawyer and executive director of the @entity268 , which backed @entity63 , speaking prior to arguments before the @entity2 in october , said , " the rule we want the @entity2 to adopt is simple : you bought it , you own it and you can do with it what you please			0
very clear , very clean , very easy			0
the copyright holders are getting paid			1
they 're getting paid on the first sale			0
" in dissent tuesday , justice @entity280 said the majority ruling could affect future international trade negotiations			0
she was supported by justices @entity284 and @entity286			0
in federal law , she said , " @entity287 intended to provide copyright owners with a remedy against unauthorized importation of foreign - made copies of their works , even if those copies were made and sold abroad with the copyright owner 's authorization			1
" the high court already had ruled in prior cases that copyright holders can not block @entity14 - made goods sent overseas from later being brought back into the country for resale			1
the issue in this case was whether copyright laws applied to foreign - made goods imported into the @entity14 market			1
@entity63 , now a professor back in @entity5 , never responded to @entity1 's efforts for an interview			0
he initially testified receiving advice from friends back home -- and consulting " @entity315 , " an online research help service -- to ensure he could legally resell the foreign editions in the @entity14			1
in court papers , he also said he was unable to afford the hefty pending judgment against him			0
the man 's lawyers said that after the lower court 's verdict , he was ordered to give the publisher his golf clubs and computer in partial compensation			0
the case is @entity63 v. @entity130 ( 11 - 697 ) .			0

the court says copyrighted works from abroad can be resold within the @entity14
the ruling covers libraries , artistic venues -- even the local garage sale
the first sale doctrine generally lets copyright holders profit only from the original sale
