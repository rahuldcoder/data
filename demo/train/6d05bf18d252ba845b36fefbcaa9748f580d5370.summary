@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on monday searched desperately for ways it could avoid a sweeping ruling in what one justice called a " tinderbox " legal fight over perhaps the most vexing diplomatic issue -- unrest in the @entity11			1
@entity13 , 12 , and his family want the @entity3 citizen 's passport to say he was born in @entity17 , @entity18			1
but the @entity20 , ignoring a congressional law , will not allow the boy to list his country of birth on the document , only @entity17			1
the @entity26 administration maintains a strict neutrality policy over the holy city 's sovereignty			0
both @entity18 and @entity30 claim @entity17 as their capital , but the international community does not recognize either position			1
the @entity34 framed the case as a " small gesture " for a boy , which does not implicate the @entity3 government 's ongoing efforts to secure a binding , lasting peace settlement for the troubled region			1
@entity2 to decide if boy can list @entity18 as passport birthplace at issue is a classic tug of war between the executive and legislative branches of government -- specifically whether a federal law that explicitly directs the @entity20 how to record the birthplace of an @entity3 citizen on a passport impermissibly infringes on the president 's power to recognize a foreign sovereign			1
more than 50,000 @entity3 were born in @entity17 since the law was passed in 2002			1
in a brisk hour of oral arguments , the nine justices seemed especially torn about how to decide the case , many looking for a way perhaps to rule narrowly			2
many on the bench were at odds over whether this mix of politics , diplomacy and religion will result in de facto recognition of @entity18 's unilateral sovereignty over @entity17			1
" you say that this is n't recognition , " justice @entity70 told the @entity34 ' attorney			0
" so the ultimate conflict is not before us and therefore , the government 's policy , which says that this is recognition , should be given deference and it trumps			0
" justice @entity80 said , " @entity81 is entitled to do what it is authorized to do under the @entity83 , even when that contradicts " with the views of the executive branch , and as far as the passport issue , " the fact that the @entity20 does n't like the fact that it makes the @entity30 angry is irrelevant			1
" case heard during growing unrest in @entity17 the debate comes during a week of unrest in @entity17 , with daily protests near sacred sites and fears of a third intifada , or @entity30 uprising			2
@entity100 crisis fuels unrest in volatile @entity17 the case could have broader implications over @entity3 foreign policy			1
the justices raised ongoing debates over those born in @entity108 - controlled @entity107 ; whether @entity109 should be recognized as independent of @entity111 ; and the armed conflict between @entity113 and @entity114 over disputed territory , including @entity116			2
@entity17 's @entity117 is the heart of the region , a holy symbol to the three major @entity122 religions -- @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125			2
that tiny area -- just a third of one square mile -- contains the @entity100 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
it has been destroyed twice -- and attacked , besieged and captured more than 100 times			0
canaanites , @entity135 , arabs , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and the @entity108 have all laid claim to the land			0
its status today remains one the thorniest issues blocking a comprehensive @entity11 peace agreement , with both @entity18 and the @entity30 people claiming sovereignty			1
during the 1948 war , the western part of the city was annexed by the newly formed nation of @entity18 , and the eastern part annexed by @entity155			2
@entity18 then captured the eastern part during the 1967 @entity156			2
it considers @entity17 part of its " undivided capital , " but most of the international community deems the annexations illegal and a part of @entity30 land			2
the @entity18 government is based there , but no foreign embassies are			2
the city is home to @entity168 and @entity169			0
the couple and their two oldest sons were born in the @entity3 , but the family migrated to @entity18 a decade ago , and in october 2002 the youngest , @entity174 , was born			1
" we 're very proud of the fact that he was born in @entity18 and that we live in @entity18 and it 's the modern state of @entity18 , " @entity175 told @entity1			2
" religiously and historically , that 's very significant			0
" the father said his son -- who has been at the center of this legal fight for 11 of his 12 years -- frequently reminds his siblings he is the one @entity13 born in their current home			0
the boy is preparing for his bar mitzvah			0
@entity189 's ' signing statement ' three weeks before @entity13 was born , @entity81 gave @entity3 citizens born in @entity17 the individual discretion to ask that @entity18 be listed on passports and consular reports , where it says " @entity194			1
" president @entity189 signed the bill but issued an executive " signing statement " indicating he would not comply			0
the law , he said , " impermissibly interferes with the president 's constitutional authority to conduct the nation 's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch			0
" the @entity20 's official @entity203 still reads : " for a person born in @entity17 , write @entity17 as the place of birth in the passport			1
do not write @entity18 , @entity155 or @entity208 for a person born within the current municipal borders of @entity17			1
" it is not the first time @entity81 and the @entity213 have clashed over the region			0
the @entity3 embassy remains in @entity216 over @entity3 lawmakers ' objections			0
competition to speak among justices during monday 's oral arguments in the case , @entity13 v. @entity222 , there was much competition on the bench to speak			2
chief justice @entity228 at one point had to referee and allow @entity70 , with his seniority , to go first			0
" you want us to say in our opinion that this is not a political declaration ? " @entity70 asked attorney @entity235 of the 12 - year - old congressional law			0
when told that was true , " well , then , i 'm not sure why that @entity81 passed it then			0
" @entity70 offered a compromise , suggesting what a select number of @entity3 passports might say : " the place of birth on this @entity17 - born citizen 's passport has been listed as @entity18 at the holder 's request			1
this designation is neither an acknowledgment nor a declaration by the @entity20 or the @entity252 that @entity17 is within the borders of the @entity18			1
" but justice @entity254 -- who along with justices @entity255 and @entity257 seemed most supportive of the administration 's assertions -- wondered " ( i ) f @entity81 then passed a law saying that ( hypothetical ) statement had to come off the passport , could @entity81 do that ? " " why is it that it 's ok for @entity81 to say something that has n't happened , meaning to say that someone born in @entity17 is actually born in @entity18 ? " @entity257 added			1
" i mean , they can self - identify all they want , but can they do that ? " representing the government , solicitor general @entity271 framed the issue in larger terms , saying the congressional law in effect would " force the executive branch to issue official diplomatic communications that contradict the position of the @entity3			1
" justice @entity280 asked , " but is that really true ? could @entity81 pass a law saying that every passport issued to an @entity3 citizen must list the place of birth , including country , and that for this purpose , the country is the nation that issued the birth certificate to that individual ? could @entity81 do that ? " @entity13 's attorney , @entity235 , concluded by saying granting the boy 's request would be a " nonissue " and have no long - term effect since the @entity17 passports -- by simply listing " @entity18 " would be indistinguishable from those who were born elsewhere in @entity18			1
" this seems a particularly unfortunate week to be making this kind of , ' oh , it 's no big deal ' argument , " said @entity254 , referring the recent violent protests in @entity17			0
" history suggests that everything is a big deal with respect to the status of @entity17			0
and right now @entity17 is a tinderbox because of issues about the status of and access to a particularly holy site there			0
and so sort of everything matters , does n't it ? " a ruling in the case is due by the spring .			0

a boy , 12 , and his family want his passport to say he was born in @entity18
ignoring law passed in 2002 , @entity20 policy is to list only @entity17 , not @entity18
at issue is a classic tug of war between the executive and legislative branches
justices weigh arguments in case that could have impact on @entity3 policy in @entity11
