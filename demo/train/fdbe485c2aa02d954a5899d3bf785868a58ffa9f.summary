-- like millions of other @entity3 , @entity1 and @entity2 packed up their vehicle and headed out for a @entity6 weekend trip			1
as they crossed the @entity10 bridge over the @entity11 outside @entity12 , @entity13 , the bridge gave way and their pickup truck plunged into the frigid waters			1
luckily , everyone survived thursday 's incident			2
when a bridge fails , such as the i - 5 bridge in @entity13 , it raises questions about the safety of millions of travelers			1
where are @entity3 's risky bridges ? are interstate bridges being properly inspected ? what will it take to make the nation 's bridges safer ? related : find deficient bridges near you we should n't be worried , but we should be wary : that 's the message from the @entity37 , which puts out a " report card " on the safety and maintenance of @entity3 bridges			1
right now , @entity3 's got a c +			1
that may be a passing grade , but it 's not good enough , says infrastructure expert @entity46			2
that 's because there have been nearly 600 bridge failures since 1989 , @entity46 told @entity0			1
and one out of every nine @entity3 bridges is rated as " structurally deficient , " according to the @entity37			1
thursday 's collapse was apparently caused when a tractor - trailer struck one of the overhead beams of the bridge , which is nearly six decades old			1
@entity46 said it is " totally unacceptable " that the bridge did not have another support structure			2
" @entity59 today have redundancy so that where you have something hitting a structural element , there ( are ) other supports to keep the bridge up , " he noted			2
" that is something that bridge engineers understand , but politicians are not funding			2
" president @entity71 has championed infrastructure spending since taking office , yet he has n't been able to convince lawmakers to support his initiatives			1
" the problem is we 've had some trouble out of @entity82 just going ahead and funding , " @entity71 said last week during a speech in @entity77 , @entity78			1
the president directed government agencies to " do what it takes to cut timelines for breaking ground on major infrastructure projects in half			2
" " sometimes it takes too long to get projects off the ground , " @entity71 said			1
maintaining bridges and other key transportation links is not only a safety issue -- it 's an economic matter , as well			2
" we are on the brink of losing our competitive edge in the global marketplace as a result , " sen. @entity99 , @entity100 , said wednesday			0
politicians are turning their backs on this issue , said @entity46			0
they " do not see infrastructure as a high priority and the @entity3 public and our economic system is paying a terrible price for this			2
" of course , a lot of this issue surrounds money			0
to make all necessary repairs to @entity3 's bridges , the @entity118 estimates it will cost $ 76 billion			1
who 's going to pay for that ? taxpayers ? no thank you , say most of the @entity3 who answered a recent @entity127 poll			1
two thirds said they 're against paying more in gasoline taxes to fund bridge and road repairs in their own states			2
and it did n't matter if the respondents were @entity135 , @entity136 or independent			0
here 's another sobering stat : the average age of all 607,400 bridges in the @entity3 is 42 years			1
it points to the fact that so much of this issue revolves around trust			0
do we trust the systems now in place that are aimed at finding bad bridges and taking appropriate action ? the federal government requires all bridges to be inspected at least every two years			1
if inspectors find something wrong , they can order emergency repairs or cut the size of vehicles allowed to cross , or even shut the bridges down entirely			2
@entity13 's i - 5 bridge had been inspected as recently as november			1
it was built in 1955 and had been rated " functionally obsolete , " according to a federal database			0
@entity46 explained that this classification does n't mean that the bridge is necessarily unsafe			0
" what it does indicate is that there are serious failures because of lack of maintenance , " he said			0
" a bridge that is designed in 1955 could never have contemplated heavy 18 - wheeler trucks			0
" bridge engineer @entity171 says that the current @entity3 model of inspecting bridges is working just fine			1
" engineers are watching -- trying to ensure the public safety , " said @entity174 , a former president of the @entity37 who has spent 40 years designing and maintaining bridges			1
" if you look at the @entity179 in @entity180 , they were watching that bridge very carefully and when it got to the point where the deterioration was suddenly accelerating , they decided to close it immediately			0
" the bridge , which linked @entity188 , @entity180 , with @entity189 , @entity190 , was demolished in 2009 and a newly built bridge opened to traffic in 2011			0
in some instances , the new generation of bridges that are being built today include new monitoring technology instead of relying solely on bridge inspectors			1
when the @entity199 collapsed in @entity200 in 2007 , 13 people died and 145 others were hurt			0
the bridge that replaced it cost $ 233.8 million			0
out of that budget , about $ 1 million paid for smart technology that senses danger and warns of a potential structural threat			0
sensors were built into the bridge to monitor corrosion , stress and the movement of the structure from constant traffic			0
a tiny beam of light is used to measure very small differences in the movement of the bridge when vehicles pass over			0
data from the sensors is monitored , providing an extra layer of engineering oversight			0
" we want these bridges to be safe , " said @entity174			0
" but we need to provide the funding , the investment to make them safe			0
" the number of @entity3 's deficient bridges has actually decreased " ever so slightly over the last couple of years , " @entity174 said			1
that 's mostly because of increased funding from state and local governments , he said			0
is that a good sign ? @entity174 said yes , but he added , " if we do n't start accelerating we could start losing ground			0
" would you support an increase of your state 's gasoline tax to pay for bridge and road repairs in your state ? let us know in the comments section below .			2

after collapse of @entity13 's @entity10 bridge , should *drivers* worry ?
no , says top @entity3 bridge engineer , but they should be " wary "
all bridges must be inspected every two years ; new technology offers extra *protection*
president @entity71 takes action to speed up bridge *improvements*
