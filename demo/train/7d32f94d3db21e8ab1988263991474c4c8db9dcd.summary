@entity0 -- a @entity3 stealth drone that crashed in @entity5 last week was part of a @entity8 reconnaissance mission which involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in @entity11 , two @entity3 officials confirmed to @entity1 tuesday			1
a senior @entity3 official with direct access to the assessment about what happened to the drone said it was tasked to fly over western @entity11 and look for insurgent activity , with no directive to either fly into @entity5 or spy on @entity5 from @entity11 airspace			1
a @entity3 satellite quickly pinpointed the downed drone , which apparently sustained significant damage , the senior official said			2
" the @entity5 have a pile of rubble and are trying to figure what they have and what to do with it , " the senior @entity3 official said			1
the drone crashed solely because its guidance system failed , the official said			1
officials confirmed to @entity1 it was an @entity37 drone that was lost			1
another @entity3 official confirmed that when the drone crashed , the @entity3 briefly considered all potential options for retrieving the aircraft or bombing the wreckage , but those ideas were quickly discarded as impractical			1
the officials have direct knowledge of the events , but spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence matters			0
@entity8 officials have declined to comment			0
indications of the intelligence community 's involvement in the drone incident emerged over the weekend , when @entity57 's @entity56 in @entity11 issued a statement saying , " the @entity59 ( unmanned aerial vehicle ) to which the @entity5 are referring may be a @entity3 unarmed reconnaissance aircraft that had been flying a mission over western @entity11 late last week			1
the operators of the @entity59 lost control of the aircraft and had been working to determine its status			0
" several coalition officials said at the time they had no direct knowledge of the incident and they were essentially ordered to put out this statement			0
it 's significant that the statement only says " operators " of the @entity59 , without saying which part of the military or @entity3 government might have been operating it , one coalition official said			2
@entity3 officials are discounting the @entity5 claim that they shot the drone down			1
the @entity3 continues to say the crew of the @entity59 lost flight control and the drone then entered @entity5 airspace			2
@entity3 officials over the years have been adamant that @entity3 assets do not fly over @entity5 air space			2
the @entity37 is a stealth drone developed by @entity91 for the @entity92 to help provide intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance			0
@entity5 media reported that the @entity37 was slightly damaged and in the hands of @entity5 forces			0
" armed forces with a dominant control over the country 's borders managed to identify and down the invading plane , " reported @entity5 's official news agency , the @entity103			0
an unnamed @entity5 military official called it a " clear example of aggression " and added that @entity5 is " fully ready to counter any aggression , " the report said			0
in july , @entity5 's military made a similar claim , saying it downed a @entity3 " spy drone " flying near its @entity114 nuclear enrichment plant in @entity115			2
but @entity5 backtracked on the statement a few days later , saying the incident was actually part of a training exercise .			0
