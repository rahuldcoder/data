@entity0 allows people to lead two lives -- one in the real world and another in the virtual			1
but in a way , @entity0 itself leads two lives			1
in just fours years of existence , @entity0 has moved far beyond people simulating other lives on the @entity11			1
in its first , well - publicized life , it 's a forum for residents to socialize , shop and even have sex via on - screen avatars			2
in its second life , it 's a flexible platform for running inexpensive simulations and experiments			2
the latter might prove to be the most important			0
" @entity0 's real potential may be that of an experimentation platform , " says @entity23 , a professor at @entity24			1
he notes the ability within @entity0 to rapidly construct objects and experiences " without having to build the world from scratch			1
" indeed , it 's relatively easy for residents to build objects that others can use , sit on , walk through , pick up and so on			2
that can mean anything from a hammer to a house to a landscape			0
and since it 's also easy to share , replicate and tweak creations , @entity0 is a world of abundance for creators			1
that makes it an effective testing platform for trying out concepts quickly and cheaply			0
@entity49 , an @entity24 research fellow , reports creating simulations in three days -- for $ 350 -- that others proposed building in six months for $ 60,000			0
that 's caught the attention of the corporate world			2
many companies see potential savings , for instance , in moving parts of their new - employee training programs to a virtual world			1
@entity49 has been hired by a range of companies -- from a pest extermination firm to a power plant operator -- to create prototypes of such systems in @entity0			1
security concerns testing a concept in @entity0 does n't have to mean hosting the final product there			1
security might be a concern , for instance			0
" by definition , social networking is open , " notes @entity75 , president of @entity76 , a corporate - training consultancy in @entity77			2
" that 's kind of contrary to corporate training , which is closed and proprietary			1
" a company , then , might try to find a more secure virtual environment , or perhaps add security elements within @entity0			1
of course , most of the experimenting done in @entity0 is far more light - hearted			1
but it 's still often easy to envision commercial or educational applications			2
in one @entity91 clip a man is seen exercising on a treadmill in front of a large plasma screen that displays scenes from @entity0			1
using the wireless controller from @entity99 's @entity98 console , he appears to indicate which scenery he would like to jog " through " on the screen			2
if that 's a workable concept , the fitness equipment industry might like to know about it			2
other @entity0 experiments aim to make experimentation itself easier -- especially important for those with little programming knowledge			1
this suggests that the level of creativity will only increase			0
many residents who have learned how to create objects -- like a house -- still lack the scripting skills to add behavior to those objects			0
so @entity119 , a grad student at @entity24 's @entity120 , is building a user - friendly programming tool for easily adding behaviors			2
when the tool is available , turning a static dance floor into an interactive one that shakes when stepped on could simply require dragging a " @entity127 " module over it			0
how a capability like that might be used is anyone 's guess , including @entity119 's , he admits			2
but , he adds , " we could see a blossoming of new content created by people who do n't have any background in programming , but who can imagine and create new kinds of experiences in @entity0			1
" tapping users ' creativity of course , back in 2003 when @entity0 was launched as a largely user - generated virtual world , how it would be used was anyone 's guess			1
but the whole idea was to tap the creativity of the residents themselves			0
" i 'm not surprised by the amount of experimentation in @entity0 , " says @entity152 , founder and ceo of @entity154 , the company behind the virtual world			1
" i always expected to see resident innovation and creativity			0
" yet this aspect of @entity0 has been overshadowed of late			1
residents who socialize primarily in the virtual world have been chided to " get a first life			0
" @entity164 has been lampooned for spending large sums on branded virtual islands that nobody hangs out on			0
but aside from these cycles of hype and anti-hype , the original goal of uninhibited mass experimentation proceeds apace			0
just as the company gave up some control to encourage creativity , some creations in @entity0 operate freely on their own			1
resident - created @entity178 , for instance , boasts an interdependent ecosystem within @entity0 that acts according to the rules of " nature , " with tropical plants needing the insects and everything needing the physics - driven rain clouds			1
every element acts according to rules , but within that framework there is much randomness -- just like with nature			0
it 's easy to see the educational possibilities			0
some experiments involve bringing things out of @entity0 and into the real world			1
residents are now looking to three - dimensional printers , among other methods , for turning their virtual objects into real ones			0
" the possibilities on @entity0 are endless , " says @entity203 , who designs virtual ball gowns she hopes to bring to the real world			1
" we are only limited by our imaginations			0
" other experiments within @entity0 are kept out of general view			1
@entity49 tells of a surreal encounter he had with a software programmer 's avatar about six months ago			0
on a dark night in the virtual world , he says , " we walked off the edge of his land to a spot deep beneath the ocean and into an underwater cave			0
he then showed me some achievements in software engineering that were well beyond what i then thought was possible in any environment , real or virtual			0
" @entity226 continues as a popular place to hold such experimentation remains to be seen			0
@entity119 was attracted by its " large existing user base " and " creative culture			0
" other platforms , though , have drawn attention for their own merits			0
croquet , for instance , trumpets being open - source and decentralized			0
as a proof of concept , though , @entity0 has already been an interesting experiment			2

@entity0 's real value may be to test ideas , *analysts* say
many companies already have moved employee training to @entity0
some creations in @entity0 are operating on their own
