-- on the @entity2 there is a saying which has become synonymous with any tourist visit to the @entity6 capital			0
it 's up there with the @entity10 , a wonderfully indulgent cream tea , @entity12 outside the @entity13 and all those quintessentially @entity15 pastimes which tend to draw those flocking from overseas			0
it is a saying which has been emblazoned across numerous t - shirts and posters , while children on the underground seem to delight in repeating the famous phrase			2
but now , in @entity2 at least , those three words have been hijacked by the supporters of @entity25 and @entity26 , who will now no doubt continue to mock each other until the end of the season			1
following @entity25 's 2 - 1 win over its city rival sunday , the " gap " is seven points with @entity34 ' side now occupying third place and more importantly , a qualification spot for next year 's @entity37			1
but @entity26 has been here before			1
last season , @entity25 blew a 10 - point advantage to allow its fiercest foe to take third spot and a place in @entity45 's elite competition			1
before @entity26 's astonishing comeback , which followed the 5 - 2 thrashing of @entity25 just over a year ago , it was those dressed in the blue and white which sang merrily about minding the gap			1
it was a song they would come to regret as @entity26 grew in strength while @entity25 faltered , eventually leading to @entity55 's exit and the failure to reach the promised land of the @entity37			1
but a year in football is a long time -- just ask @entity34			0
a year ago monday , the man known as " avb " was sent packing from @entity62 with his reputation in ruin			0
@entity62 owner @entity65 had paid $ 20 million to take the young @entity67 coach from @entity68 to @entity69 less than 10 months earlier			2
but his spell in charge proved a disaster , leaving the club on the brink of exit from the @entity37 , out of the @entity77 title race and facing humiliation			0
vilified for his team selections , his unorthodox style of crouching on the touchline and man - management skills , he was seen as " @entity85 " and simply not in the same class as the " @entity84			2
" @entity34 confirmed as new @entity25 boss but a year on since leaving west @entity2 , @entity34 is steadily building a team bursting with potential , led by the ever improving @entity88			1
it was @entity88 , of course , who proved the man for the occasion , firing @entity25 ahead eight minutes before the break with a coolly taken finish -- his 20th of the season			1
with nine goals in his past seven club games , @entity88 continues to astound , rightly or wrongly allowing comparisons with @entity99 and @entity100 to gather pace			1
while his imperious run of form has been a joy for @entity25 supporters , it is also the new found steel which has been lacking in the past , which has made this side a far more accomplished proposition			1
@entity34 : @entity110 is the perfect club for @entity111 once @entity112 had added a second less than two minutes after @entity88 's opener , @entity26 was facing an uphill struggle			1
suddenly that gap was increasing and @entity26 's apathetic attitude to defending gave little to suggest that anything but a widening chasm between the two clubs			1
now unbeaten in 12 league games , @entity25 deserves to be taken seriously			1
" forever in our shadow " was what @entity26 fans used to chant at their rivals -- and with justification following its domination of north @entity2 since @entity127 's arrival			2
in fact , not since 1995 has @entity25 finished above @entity26 in @entity15 's top division , a statistic which will surely be consigned to history at the end of the current campaign			1
yes , @entity26 did find a route back into the game after the interval when @entity88 inadvertently directed @entity140 's header into his own net			1
@entity88 steals limelight but @entity25 , marshaled by @entity143 and @entity144 , held out comfortably to claim a crucial victory in their quest for the @entity37 and the domination of north @entity2			1
" it was very , very important for what it means , but obviously nothing is finished yet , " @entity34 told @entity149			0
" we have to believe that we still have to fight hard			0
@entity26 have to play @entity153 , we have to play @entity154 ( next weekend )			2
" we try to profit from another important fixture and keep doing our job			0
it is important we gather as many points as we can to finish where we want to be			2
" last year , by this time , @entity26 made the difference of seven points to @entity25 and we know how it finished , " @entity34 added			1
" motivations are now different			0
they are on a low at the moment			0
we have to continue to do our job			0
" pressure grows on @entity127 for @entity26 and its beleaguered manager @entity127 , the gap shows no sign of narrowing any time soon			2
for 16 years it has been the ruler of its own backyard , but the neighbor is beginning to stir			0
without a trophy in eight years , on the brink of an exit from the @entity37 , the @entity172 is facing the most difficult spell since he arrived at the club in october 1996			0
but @entity127 refutes any suggestion that @entity25 has overtaken his side in terms of quality			2
" that 's not the impression i got from the game today , " he told @entity182			0
" we were not efficient in those decisive zones , not at the back or up front			2
" we were not cautious enough			0
on the two goals we played offside in a position where we should n't play offside			2
" it is difficult to struggle with defeat because of the effort we put in and the energy level we put in over the 90 minutes was tremendous			0
" we made it difficult for ourselves			0
we came back and dominated the game but the game was stop and go			2
" it was difficult to get a flow in the final 20 minutes , we did n't find the second goal			2
" united march on but as fans got back onto the @entity2 this evening following the contest , the question marks over @entity127 's future remain			0
monday will mark his 6000th day in charge and while supporters may be losing faith , @entity127 is adamant @entity26 can still qualify for next season 's @entity37 he added : " it 's very frustrating , but we have to put the energy in every game like we did today and keep going , you never know			1
" it would be absolutely terrible not to fight like mad because there are a lot of positives in the game			0
" what happened today we have seen repeated so many times in big games that of course it 's difficult			0
" @entity225 punished for fourth racism in @entity228 , @entity227 spared @entity229 any embarrassment with a late cameo performance to steal a 3 - 2 win at @entity233			1
trailing 2 - 0 at the break thanks to strikes from @entity236 and @entity237 , @entity229 fought back in the second half to turn the game on its head			1
@entity241 halved the deficit before @entity227 fired home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining			0
and with the contest entering the second minute of stoppage time , @entity227 found space to drill home a dramatic winner			0
" we had a terrible 20 minute period and were punished for our mistake on the first goal , " coach @entity250 told @entity251			0
" luckily this team has thick skin and managed to fight their way back into the game			0
" it 's an important victory for us against a team which is in great form			0
thankfully the real @entity229 emerged after the interval			2
" @entity15 managers on the brink ? elsewhere , @entity267 gained a 2 - 1 win over @entity269 , @entity266 defeated @entity270 3 - 0 and @entity272 's 58th minute effort secured all three points for @entity274 against @entity275			1
@entity276 recorded a 2 - 0 win at @entity279 courtesy of @entity283 's double , while @entity281 and @entity282 's game ended goalless			1
in the late game , @entity284 defeated @entity286 3 - 1 with @entity287 on target			1
@entity290 brace earns @entity292 points in @entity293 , @entity110 maintained its 17 point lead at the top of the @entity296 following a 1 - 0 win over @entity298			1
@entity300 's strike gave @entity110 its 10th straight win , despite being given a difficult afternoon by the relegation threatened side			1
" the game was very difficult because of the opponent 's league predicament , " coach @entity304 told reporters			0
" we had to work hard for the win , it was n't brilliant or glamorous , but in return for 90 minutes work , we got three points			2
" we were a bit superficial ; we were n't direct enough and not lively enough			0
it took a while to warm up the engine			0
" meanwhile , @entity110 has been drawn at home to face @entity320 in the @entity322 semifinal , while @entity323 will travel to @entity324 in the other fixture			2
in @entity172 , @entity326 was held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity328 , while @entity329 reclaimed third place in @entity331 after coming from behind to defeat @entity332 2 - 1			1
@entity333 saw off @entity334 2 - 1 in the day 's late game thanks to goals from @entity337 and @entity338			1
in @entity340 , @entity339 was held to a goalless draw at @entity342 as it missed out on the chance to close the gap on leader @entity345			0
@entity348 suffered a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity350 , @entity347 drew 0 - 0 with @entity351 and @entity352 shared a six - goal thriller with @entity354 as it ended 3 - 3 .			1
