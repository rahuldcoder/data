chief and political contender @entity1 has seen his reputation tarnished in a turbulent 12 months			1
he was once most known for his brilliant grasp of global economics and @entity8 politics			0
now , his name is connected with an accusation of sexual assault from a hotel maid in @entity13 and an investigation into gang rape and " aggravated pimping " in @entity17 by prosecutors who allege he participated in a prostitution ring			1
just last year , @entity1 was head of the powerful @entity2 and the presumptive front - runner for the presidency of @entity17			1
but when a hotel employee accused him of assaulting her in @entity26 's @entity25 last may his professional life disintegrated			0
despite denying the charges , he stepped down from the @entity2 and his dream of leading @entity17 's @entity29 in this year 's presidential election vanished			1
however , the criminal case against him fell apart before it reached a courtroom when @entity13 prosecutors cited credibility issues with the maid 's story			1
@entity1 still faces a civil suit in the case			2
it was , by any standard , a stunning fall for the man many presumed would be the new occupant of the @entity42 instead of @entity43			0
it was also a cautionary tale for those who might forget how quickly sexual allegations can bring down even the most influential leaders			2
long before he ended up on the front pages of the tabloids , @entity1 was well known to followers of global financial news			2
the @entity53 - educated economist headed the @entity2 for the duration of the global financial crisis			2
in doing so , he played a lead role in arranging bailouts for @entity58 and @entity59 , as well as propping up @entity8 's single currency , the euro			0
the @entity2 , which , among other things , assists countries suffering economic difficulties by providing loans , was founded near the end of @entity67 and is now made up of 187 countries			2
@entity1 was a force in @entity17 politics for a quarter - century , first winning election to that country 's @entity72 -- the lower house of parliament -- in 1986			1
he was president @entity76 's trade minister from 1991 to 1993 , and went on to serve as finance minister in the late 1990s			0
during that period , @entity78 joined the euro and ditched the franc			0
in 1999 , after an allegation of unethical financial doings involving his consulting business , @entity1 resigned his ministerial post			2
he was later acquitted of the charges			0
@entity1 lost a fight with @entity88 for the @entity29 's presidential nomination in 2006			2
one year later , he was named managing director of the @entity2			0
married to his third wife and the father of four children , he has also taught economics at @entity95 in @entity96 and at the prestigious @entity97 , known as @entity97			0
a dominant figure on the @entity17 left , @entity1 also gained a reputation over the years as someone who enjoys a lavish lifestyle -- critics have made much of his image as a " champagne socialist			1
" as head of the @entity2 , @entity1 pulled in an annual tax - free salary of more than $ 420,000 , according to a 2007 statement from the organization			1
he also received more than $ 75,000 for " a scale of living appropriate " to his position			0
to the extent that there was a perceived conflict between his socialist political ideals and wealthy lifestyle , it was n't an issue for most @entity17 voters , said @entity120 , a senior @entity8 analyst at the @entity121 , a @entity123 think tank			0
similarly , @entity17 voters typically take little notice of allegations of infidelility , which are much less likely to derail a political career in @entity17 than in @entity129 -- though in @entity1 's case , the sheer volume of accusations seems to have stymied his ambitions , especially with the election this month of @entity43 as @entity17 president			1
@entity1 became embroiled in sexual controversy soon after joining the @entity2 in 2007 : in 2008 , he was reprimanded for having a relationship with a female employee			1
an independent inquiry found the relationship was consensual , and the @entity2 's executive board concluded that " there was no harassment , favoritism or any other abuse of authority by the managing director , " but it found that " the incident was regrettable and reflected a serious error of judgment			0
" @entity1 issued a statement after the investigation , noting that he had " apologized for it to the ( board of directors ) , to the staff of the @entity2 and to my family , " as well as to the employee			1
in the months following the @entity25 accusation last year , other allegations surfaced			0
@entity160 , a @entity29 member of the @entity17 parliament , said @entity1 had attacked her daughter			1
@entity160 said she had cautioned her daughter , @entity163 , not to file a police report at the time , saying it might adversely impact her career			0
last year , @entity163 did file a complaint , alleging a 2002 attack , though it could not be pursued because the statute of limitations had expired			0
@entity1 denied the allegations and has since filed a counter-suit in @entity17 , alleging slander			1
@entity0 does not typically name assault victims , but @entity160 said her daughter gave permission for her name to be disclosed			0
now @entity1 faces another legal battle -- this time the case centers on an investigation into a high - profile prostitution network operating out of luxury hotels in the @entity17 city of @entity183			1
in may police @entity17 prosecutors have widened the investigation , opening a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in @entity123 , which they believe could constitute gang rape			1
@entity0 has yet to hear from @entity1 's lawyers about the allegations			2
when the pimping claims surfaced , in november last year , @entity1 's attorneys condemned the allegations as " unhealthy , sensationalist and not without a political agenda			2
" his lawyer , @entity197 , acknowledged in an interview with radio station @entity199 that @entity1 attended sex parties , but says his client was unaware that the women involved were prostitutes			0
@entity1 is not allowed to have contact with other people involved in the investigation , nor is he permitted to talk to the media about the case .			1

@entity1 was @entity2 chief and had been *expected* to run for @entity17 presidency
his downfall came with an accusation of sexual assault in a @entity13 hotel , which he denied
now @entity17 prosecutors have widened an investigation , with new allegations of gang rape
the @entity13 case never saw a courtroom ; @entity1 denies the allegations in @entity17 case
