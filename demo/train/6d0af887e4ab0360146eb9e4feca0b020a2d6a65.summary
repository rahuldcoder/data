-- @entity2 's top diplomat sunday accused the @entity3 of " blackmailing " @entity4 into backing tough ground rules for @entity7 's chemical disarmament that would include the threat of force if @entity7 balks			1
@entity7 has agreed to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons under international pressure and delivered an inventory of its poison gas stocks to the @entity15 over the weekend			2
but @entity17 members are still trying to hammer out a resolution to outline the process , with @entity2 and @entity21 powers at odds over the language			2
in a sunday interview on @entity2 television , @entity24 said @entity27 was threatening to sink the deal unless the resolution was drawn up under @entity30 of the @entity17 charter , which would authorize the use of force against @entity7 if it does n't comply			1
as @entity7 's leading ally , @entity2 has opposed threats of military action			1
" the @entity3 partners are blackmailing us , " @entity24 told the state - owned @entity38 network			1
" they say they will quit the work at the @entity15 in the @entity44 if @entity2 does not back the resolution based on @entity46 at the @entity17			2
" @entity24 said the @entity3 " are interested in proving their superiority , and this is absolutely not the objective that drives us -- to solve the problem of chemical weapons in @entity7			1
" @entity2 on @entity7 - no more ' nyet ? ' speaking on condition of anonymity , a senior @entity55 official responded that @entity27 is n't focused on words , " but actions			1
" " what our team at the @entity17 is focused on right now is working through the details of a @entity17 resolution with the strongest possible enforcement mechanism , " the official said			1
" we 're not going to litigate the details of a potential resolution in public			0
" @entity7 is 2 1/2 years into a civil war that has already left more than 100,000 dead , according to the @entity71			2
the @entity3 and several of its allies , particularly @entity73 , began calling for military action against @entity7 government forces after an august 21 attack outside @entity77 that they said involved the use of chemical weapons against civilians			2
@entity17 weapons inspectors reported monday that the nerve agent sarin had been used in the attack			0
though the inspectors did not assign blame , @entity27 said details of the report pointed toward troops loyal to @entity7 president @entity90 as the perpetrators			0
@entity7 's government denies unleashing chemical weapons , and @entity2 said @entity7 rebel forces may have been behind the august 21 attack			1
@entity24 and his @entity3 counterpart , secretary of state @entity96 , laid out a framework for @entity7 's disarmament on september 14			1
@entity96 and @entity24 spoke again sunday to reiterate " the importance of working together on implementation of their agreement in @entity104 , " the senior @entity55 official said			1
the plan calls for @entity7 to submit a comprehensive declaration of its chemical arms within one week			0
the @entity15 said saturday it had received the list from @entity7			0
the plan then calls for international inspectors in position to secure that arsenal no later than november			0
veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the @entity7 stockpile could take huge numbers of people , including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security			0
but @entity24 said sunday that he did n't see the need for a large contingent of troops to back up the inspectors , and said @entity4 was ready to stand guard " along the perimeter of areas where the experts will be working			2
" " we are ready to assign our servicemen and military police on this mission , " he said			0
" i do not think there is a need for deployment of large contingents			0
i believe that military observers would be enough			0
" in @entity7 , meanwhile , a @entity2 @entity137 official said two people were hurt when a mortar shell struck the @entity2 mission in @entity77 , the state news agency @entity135 reported			1
@entity135 quoted the unnamed official as saying the strike was " apparently an accident			0
" @entity0 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
