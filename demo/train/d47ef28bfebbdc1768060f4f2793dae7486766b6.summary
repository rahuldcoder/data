-- @entity1 says its latest @entity3 - exploring spacecraft is on track to fire up its thrusters and enter orbit this sunday night , completing a 10 - month journey of 442 million miles			1
@entity1 's @entity9 craft will live up to its formal name -- the @entity9 craft -- by helping scientists figure out how ancient @entity3 changed so dramatically into the planet we know today			1
it will be the first mission devoted to studying the upper @entity3 atmosphere as a key to understanding the history of @entity3 ' climate , water and habitability			0
@entity3 rover reaches key destination ; ' new science ahead ! ' " the evidence shows that the @entity3 atmosphere today is a cold , dry environment , one where liquid water really ca n't exist in a stable state , " said @entity25 , @entity9 principal investigator , during a mission preview briefing wednesday at @entity27 in @entity28			2
" but it also tells us when we look at older surfaces , that the ancient surfaces had liquid water flowing over it			0
" so where did the planet 's water and carbon dioxide go ? @entity25 said @entity9 will help unravel that mystery by using its scientific instruments to measure the composition and escape of gases in the @entity3 atmosphere			1
@entity9 will study the top of the atmosphere to determine the extent to which losing gas to space might have been the driving mechanism behind climate change , @entity25 said			0
before @entity9 can begin its year of exploration , it has to be inserted into orbit around @entity3			1
that is set to happen at about 10 p.m. et september 21			0
the craft 's six thruster engines will fire and burn for 33 minutes to slow the spacecraft down so it can get pulled into orbit around @entity3			1
@entity9 will have company out near @entity3 , manmade and otherwise			2
@entity66 's first mission to the @entity3 , the @entity67 , is set to arrive a few days after @entity9 does			1
the director of @entity1 's @entity69 , @entity70 , says the @entity71 and @entity66 are interested in cooperating as their crafts gather data about the planet			0
there 's a visitor of the cosmic kind , too			0
@entity79 , which was discovered last year , will be closest to @entity3 about four weeks after @entity9 arrives			2
the comet is going to miss @entity3 by about 81,000 miles , said @entity25			0
" i 'm told that the odds of having an approach that close to @entity3 are about one - in - a - million years , " he said , adding that dust from the comet carries only a " relatively minimal " risk to the spacecraft			2
@entity9 will take advantage of the rare flyby by observing the comet itself , as well as its effect on the @entity3 atmosphere			1

why did ancient @entity3 change so dramatically ? @entity9 sent to get answers
@entity9 stands for @entity9 craft
it 's *scheduled* to enter orbit around the @entity3 on sunday night
@entity3 will be having plenty of other visitors : a spacecraft from @entity66 and a comet
