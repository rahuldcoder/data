@entity0 , @entity1 -- a gaggle of reporters pushed their microphones and cameras toward the @entity8 official shortly after he arrived at a college campus here			1
@entity8 diplomat @entity10 gathered with other officials to discuss @entity8 's energy needs but @entity10 's comments were off the record -- a sign of the sensitive nature of openly discussing concerns about @entity8 's nuclear program			1
the @entity20 's director of @entity8 affairs , @entity19 , also agreed to participate in thursday 's conference as long as his statements were not published			1
@entity19 and @entity10 , a @entity8 representative at the @entity24 , gathered with others including former diplomats and academics at the @entity28 to discuss @entity8 's energy needs and the status of the six - party talks on its nuclear program			1
although the two top - level diplomats kept their remarks private , other participants in the conference at the @entity35 aired their opinions openly			2
much of the @entity8 conference focused on the scientific details of @entity8 's infrastructure and how it could be improved to handle sources of energy other than nuclear , such as an oil pipeline or utilizing its significant mineral resources			1
but all those ideas will never be realized without a change in relations between @entity8 , its neighbors and the @entity52 , and that is why diplomacy was also part of the discussion			1
thursday 's conference coincided with secretary of state @entity58 's announcement that her new envoy to @entity8 , @entity60 , will travel to @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 next week " to consult on the next steps to move the six - party process forward			1
" senior administration officials said @entity60 is considering heading to @entity69 on that visit , but only if the leaders of the other parties involved in the talks are comfortable with that overture			0
speaking at a joint news conference with @entity76 , @entity60 said there is no doubt the @entity52 plans " to engage with @entity8			1
" " the question as to whether we 're going to engage with them on this particular trip remains to be decided , " he said			0
" that will depend upon our consultations in the region , and it will depend upon what we hear back from the @entity8			2
" thursday 's conference also coincided with reports that @entity8 is apparently preparing to test - fire its long - range missile , the @entity89 , under the guise of launching a satellite into space			1
@entity93 , a specialist on @entity8 who used to work for the @entity20 , stressed that president @entity94 is at a " starting point " with @entity8			2
mindful that the new @entity52 leader is preoccupied with his country 's economic recession , @entity96 said @entity94 must act swiftly and decisively with regards to @entity8 to avoid the mistakes of the previous administration			1
" the only way to fix this problem is to negotiate , " said @entity96 , who is currently director of the @entity103 at the @entity104 in @entity105			0
part of @entity96 's proposal includes helping @entity8 construct conventional power plants as it moves toward denuclearization			1
he outlined two " troubling questions " facing the @entity94 administration : how to avoid having to constantly react under pressure to @entity8 's provocations , and how the scenario could change , possibly for the worse , if there is a change in leadership , " now that @entity122 's health is at issue			1
" " it seems to me the answer to both is for @entity127 to put a bigger deal on the negotiating table now , " @entity96 proposed			0
that drew a couple of comments and questions from the audience			0
one graduate student asked why the @entity52 should " put more oil in a leaky bucket , " referring to the idea of sending more fuel oil shipments to @entity8 when the previous shipments -- part of an agreement to get @entity69 to shut down its nuclear facility -- have done little to deter the country from abandoning its nuclear program			1
@entity8 maintains that it is due the oil shipments because it fulfilled its obligation to disable its @entity150 nuclear complex			2
the @entity52 has demanded @entity69 verify that by allowing @entity24 inspectors to inspect the facility , which it has refused			0
at thursday 's conference , former @entity52 ambassador to @entity63 @entity156 cautioned against resorting to the same rhetoric about which side had violated previous agreements			2
" i can understand how we want to score points ... but there are times when prudence or better wisdom or real strategy dictates that we have to ( have ) some sort of engagement , " he said			0
@entity170 , who was instrumental in defusing the @entity8 nuclear crisis in 1994 , suggested that the @entity52 propose a peace treaty to replace the 1953 armistice which effectively ended the @entity174			2
" a peace treaty would mean there are two nations on the @entity178 , " said @entity170			0
" there are two nations now , but a treaty would recognize ( this )			0
" @entity183 , who was the @entity184 's director of @entity186 affairs under the @entity188 administration , cautioned against moving forward on securing a peace treaty before @entity8 takes further steps toward denuclearization			1
" even if there are some ( in @entity8 ) who would want to give up nuclear weapons in exchange for a peace treaty , there may be others that say , ' once we have a peace treaty ... we can be recognized as a nuclear state , ' " according to @entity183			2
@entity183 , who said he routinely has to apologize for being a member of the @entity188 administration , praised @entity94 's government , which he said has " none of the hang - ups " in dealing with @entity8 's leadership that the previous administration had			1
@entity170 urged the new administration to " move beyond sticks and carrots , " which was the stated approach of the @entity188 administration			0
while there is no guarantee that a peace treaty or any other overture to @entity8 would work , @entity170 and @entity96 said the administration has to try a new approach			2
" you see , i 'm 81 and i want to see something ( happen ) before i die , " said @entity170 , who worked in @entity218 counterintelligence before serving in the @entity174			0
" fifty - five years is a long time			0
" @entity96 concurred , saying that " diplomatic give - and - take is the only policy " for @entity8			1
" but sustaining diplomacy ... will be difficult , " he added			0
. " @entity122 wants to force @entity52 to be his friend , " he said , referring to the @entity8 leader			0
" he seems unwilling to unclench his fist and shake @entity94 's hand			0
we may have to settle for a fist bump			0
