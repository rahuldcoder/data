-- the debate on climate change is over			1
scientists are now as certain that climate change is a real , man - made threat as they are that cigarettes kill			1
but cleaning up our air has much more to it than combating shifts in @entity11 's temperatures and environment			1
the administration 's new pollution standards -- new @entity16 regulations that place tough limits on emissions from coal - fired power plants -- are an answered prayer for working families			1
i 'm talking about those many families who endured damaged homes or lost work hours from our more frequent , and more severe , extreme weather			1
dialing down air pollution is a gust of relief for a retiree without the luxury of air conditioning , who battles climbing temperatures and brutal heat waves			1
it 's a breath of fresh air for every child playing in the shadow of a power plant , at risk from an asthma attack just by being outdoors			1
placing limits on carbon pollution from power plants is about ensuring that we have clean air to breathe and communities that are safe to live in			1
carbon pollution limits are about defending families who have borne the heaviest burden of the main pollutant that is driving climate change			1
events like @entity56 and @entity57 were unlike any weather disasters before			2
they showed the world who suffers the most from the impacts of extreme weather : low - income families and communities of color			1
these family communities lack the resources to insulate and protect themselves from the severity of this emerging crisis			1
even worse , it is the weeks and months after -- before people go back to work and businesses reopen -- that leave working families especially vulnerable			2
as we enter hurricane season again , we know that extreme weather events come and go			1
but before they arrive , it is lower - income families and people of color -- forced by housing market dynamics and land costs -- who live the very closest to carbon pollution sources , such as highways , factories and power plants			1
in addition to that , they are already predisposed to health risks			2
the @entity94 says that in excess of 20.2 million low - income people live in areas with at least one failing grade for its air			1
there are 4.5 million people breathing air that fails all three of the association 's air pollution tests			1
sixty - eight percent of african - americans have homes within 30 miles of a coal plant			1
considering that one in six @entity110 kids has asthma , compared with one in 10 children overall , that is a dangerous fact			2
an @entity110 - @entity110 child is 3.6 times more likely to visit the emergency room for asthma , as compared with white children , according to the @entity118 ' @entity117			2
let me tell you a personal story			0
on the last sunday of summer in 2005 , my niece called me from @entity123			0
" we 're leaving , " she said			0
" where are you going ? " i asked brightly			0
" on vacation ? " her answer , and the landfall of @entity56 the next day , became one of the most humbling periods of my life			0
humility and anger turned into my dominate emotions			0
i was angry for not knowing whether family members caught there without transportation had made it out safely			0
or if they had n't , whether they had survived			0
i was angry when federal officials told me that i had to wait weeks to find my sister , trapped by rising waters in an assisted - living facility			2
i was angry that my 92 - year - old uncle , stranded on his roof , was flown to @entity149 , @entity150 , only to suffer a heart attack when he landed			2
@entity56 was the storm of the 21st century			0
it devastated an area the size of @entity154			0
more than 1,800 @entity155 died			0
three hundred thousand homes were destroyed			0
there was $ 96 billion in property damage			0
i served on the @entity159			0
i saw @entity160 write one big check and then skip town			0
i respected president @entity163 , who personally visited the @entity164 17 times			0
she made certain books were donated to schools whose libraries were washed away			0
@entity56 was not a single disaster but three , a storm that wiped away miles of the @entity174 , a flood caused by breaches in the @entity123 levees and an outbreak of violence and lawlessness in the city			0
we can be thankful it was n't worse			0
we can be thankful president @entity184 is taking aim at one of the prime causes of climate change and extreme weather : air pollution			1
the @entity16 's carbon pollution standards are the most significant step forward our country has ever taken to protect our health by addressing climate change			1
they secure the hope that someday soon , power plants will no longer be free to dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into our air			1
despite what critics are saying , this is no " war on coal			2
" it 's a battle for every @entity110 's right to breathe clean air			2
join us on @entity210 / @entity209 .			0

@entity212 argues that new @entity16 rules protect families and communities of color
the regulations place tough limits on emissions from coal - fired power plants
air pollution , she says , is one of the prime causes of climate change and extreme weather
