income inequality is going up , up , up in @entity1			1
in @entity3 , meanwhile , it 's been dropping for years			1
the likely outcome ? " perhaps both countries will meet halfway , " said @entity5 , a researcher at @entity3 's @entity6			1
@entity3 , while still incredibly unequal , has realized something the @entity1 has n't : that wealth and income inequality are threats to democracy , and that smart policies can help narrow the gap between rich and poor			1
we would be wise to adopt the cash transfer programs and minimum wage policies that economists say have helped @entity3 reduce its income inequality			1
but many @entity1 politicians are reluctant to deal with this issue			1
" i think that is perhaps the most important lesson from @entity3 ... that inequality is a legitimate political matter , " @entity5 wrote in an e-mail to me			1
" that it does affect people 's lives and that at the end of the day , inequality begets inequality ... " to deny that , he said , would be " ludicrous			1
" related : you pick it , @entity38 will cover it here are five unexpected tips for how the @entity1 can and should curb its rising income inequality , pulled from @entity3 and other foreign shores , as well as our own history books			1
adopting policies from other countries always raises eyebrows			0
none will be a perfect fit			0
but the bottom line is that we need to do something before we turn into a society where , as @entity5 put it , " rags - to - riches stories become increasingly unlikely			0
@entity55 : equality is safer ... and skinnier @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 are the gold standards for economic equality and justice			1
it 's not that everyone is equal -- it 's that the gap between rich and poor is small enough that it does n't cause all sorts of other problems			1
violence , mental illness ... even obesity			0
all of these are associated with economically split societies , according to decades of research that went into the book " @entity78 , " by two epidemiologists			0
another outcome of income inequality is that it 's harder to move up in a society			1
this has been proved by data , but it 's also logical			2
when the gap is wider , a person has further to go			1
" if you want to live the @entity91 , " said @entity88 , one of the researchers , " you 'd better go to @entity58 or @entity59			0
" their rates of economic mobility are much higher			2
they achieve this with higher tax rates and better social services			2
@entity60 , for example , provides 10 weeks of paid paternity leave			0
college and health care are free in @entity58			0
when these tools exist and are available to everyone , it matters less how rich you are at birth			0
you have the same tools for success as everyone else			0
@entity112 : publish the names of the rich economic inequalities are somewhat invisible in the @entity1			1
they 're masked by credit , as @entity119 's @entity118 explained it to me , and we tend to surround ourselves with people from the same tax bracket			2
we also do n't tell each other how much money we make			0
an @entity127 writer tested this idea by running around the country asking people , " how much do you make ? " " you mean money ? " one man responded			2
money is n't something @entity1 discuss			1
and maybe that 's holding us back			2
@entity112 clears up all mysteries about the size of the rich - poor gap by making individual income tax records public , said @entity139 , a professor at the @entity140			1
" it reveals the differences , " he told me			0
in the lead up to the financial crisis , " people could see how the bankers earnings were galloping ahead of everybody else ... " 3			0
@entity149 : @entity150 's pays $ 15 an hour fast - food workers in the @entity1 have been protesting for a higher minimum wage			1
the federal minimum is $ 7.25 per hour , which is worth less than the minimum wage was in the late 1960s , when you adjust for inflation			0
@entity149 , meanwhile , manages to pay all of its workers $ 15 per hour -- and the economy , fast - food and otherwise , has n't collapsed			2
the country also maintains a lower level of income inequality			1
@entity3 : income inequality is n't forever in 2001 , @entity3 's gini index rating , one measure of income inequality , was 59.4 , according to a government source			1
by 2009 , it had dropped to 53.9			0
a score of 100 means one person earns all income in the country			2
zero means income is perfectly distributed			0
related : is class the new race ? @entity3 is still more economically divided than the @entity1 , which had a rating of 45 in 2007 , according to data compiled by the @entity179 , but @entity3 's downward trajectory is encouraging , and it 's at least partly the result of policies designed to lift people out of extreme poverty and to encourage equality of opportunity			1
one much - touted program , @entity188 , provides direct cash transfers to poor families on the condition that their children attend school			0
the program only costs 0.5 % of gdp per year , @entity5 said			0
" it certainly will not solve all our problems , " he told me , " but it has played an important role in bringing down inequality			2
" the country also adjusts its minimum wage for inflation and pegs social support programs to that amount			0
the minimum wage has increased in recent years , making it possible for people to work their way out of poverty			0
@entity1 : clues from a time capsule finally , we in the @entity1 need look no further than our own history for tips about how to run a country where prosperity is broadly shared			1
former @entity1 labor secretary @entity221 told me he 's often asked which countries the @entity1 should try to emulate to try to narrow the rich - poor gap			1
he always says 1950s or 1960s @entity1			2
back then , unions gave workers a voice ; college was affordable ; ceo pay was n't off the charts ; and the minimum wage was higher in relative terms			0
reinstating some of those policies might stop @entity1 from becoming more unequal than it already is			2
we 're ( barely ) beating @entity236			0
let 's keep it that way .			0

@entity1 has a higher level of income inequality than any developed country
the income gap is also wider than @entity246 's or @entity247 's
@entity249 : the @entity1 should take cues from other places
@entity3 , @entity112 , @entity149 and @entity55 offer important lessons , he says
