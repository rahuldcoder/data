-- presidential kids are off - limits			1
that 's the unwritten rule in @entity4			1
but rules are broken -- and @entity6 is hardly the first one to do so			2
@entity6 , communications director for @entity8 rep. @entity7 , resigned from her post after setting off a social media firestorm by railing against the @entity13 daughters			2
in a @entity14 on @entity15 , she scolded @entity16 and @entity13 , 16 and 13 years old , respectively , for what she said was their inappropriate outfits and their bored looks during wednesday 's turkey pardoning ceremony			1
" try showing a little class , " @entity6 wrote			2
" dress like you deserve respect , not a spot at a bar			2
and certainly do n't make faces during televised , public events , " she concluded			2
she later apologized , but the post went viral			0
@entity0 political analyst @entity29 said @entity6 's reaction was " way out of order			1
" " @entity33 's reality check here , folks			1
this is a turkey pardon			0
this is not a matter of war and peace			0
this is kind of an odd bit of show dating back to @entity45 , " he said			0
" and i think a bunch of teenagers could be pretty easily forgiven for not taking it too terribly seriously without insulting the republic			0
" @entity51 staffer resigns over criticism of @entity13 daughters the @entity54 expressed shock , but so did the @entity51			1
" children , especially the first daughters , should be off - limits in the political discourse from attacks , " said @entity56 , the @entity57 communications director			1
it has long been a bipartisan goal to respect , and protect , the privacy of presidential kids , who are living in a fishbowl through no fault of their own			1
but that hands - off policy has limits			1
here are some examples from the recent past : @entity71 @entity71 was just 9 years old when her father , @entity72 , took up residence in the @entity54 in 1977			0
her first day of class at a public elementary school was a media circus , with photographers snapping shots just a few feet away of her in a stocking cap , jacket and @entity83 tote bag			0
the school quickly established some ground rules to ensure a semblance of normalcy			0
even the @entity89 agents who accompanied her had to wait in an office across the hall			0
@entity93 this first daughter turned 13 about a month after the inauguration of her father , @entity96			1
wanting her to have a normal childhood , the @entity97 asked the media to limit their coverage of @entity101 to public events			0
" we really work hard on making sure that @entity101 does n't let other people define her sense of her own self - worth , " president @entity96 said in a 1992 @entity104 interview			1
" it 's tough when you are an adolescent because peer opinion and other people 's opinion become more important			1
but i think she 'll be ok			0
" still , it was n't long before " @entity118 " and @entity119 took a crack at @entity101 , mocking her appearance			0
@entity119 compared her to a dog			0
. he then recounted how he apologized once to @entity71 for calling her " the most unattractive presidential daughter in the history of the country			1
" @entity129 and @entity130 @entity129 and @entity130 , daughters of @entity132 , were already young adults -- but not of legal drinking age -- when their names were splashed in headlines during the spring of 2001 after getting caught with liquor			1
largely ignored by the media up to that point , the 19 - year - olds were branded " party girls " by the tabloids			1
five weeks later , @entity129 was in trouble again for attempting to use a fake @entity144 to buy alcohol			0
a " @entity147 " headline screamed : " @entity129 and @entity149 daughter in new booze incident as twin sister watched			0
" and all of this happened before the age of social media , in which the @entity13 daughters now live			0
when everyone has a voice via @entity15 , @entity160 and the like , the children of political families may be subjected to the same swings and arrows as their parents			0
it shows how " divided and how dumb and mean - spirited so many of our debates are right now , " @entity29 said			2
" it 's an indication of how ugly and undercutting the politics are that even kids are fair game to some people who are punching way below their weight			1
it 's ugly , ugly stuff			2
" @entity176 , @entity0 's chief @entity177 correspondent , reported from @entity4 ; @entity178 reported and wrote from @entity179 .			2
