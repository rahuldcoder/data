@entity0 -- global financial reform topped the agenda tuesday as president @entity4 huddled with @entity6 prime minister @entity5 , whose country is at the center of @entity10 's debt crisis			1
the @entity12 meeting marks the conclusion of a four - country financial relief tour for the beleaguered @entity6 leader			1
beginning friday , he visited @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 seeking support for his government 's new austerity measures to counteract skyrocketing budget deficits			2
@entity6 had one of the worst budget deficits in the developed world last year , at 12.7 percent of gross domestic product , more than three times higher than previously declared due to accounting irregularities -- or what some call outright fraud			2
it also has a public - sector debt equivalent to 113 percent of its entire economy			0
@entity37 recently unveiled a package of budget reductions to try to bring its deficit down to the 3 percent level allowed under the rules for the eurozone -- the @entity45 countries that have adopted the euro currency			0
finance ministers from those 16 countries met in @entity49 last month to try to find a way to end the crisis that some analysts say could spread to other heavily indebted @entity10 nations , such as @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			2
@entity6 's " deficit is more a credibility deficit than a financial deficit , and we need to bring back the sense of credibility , " @entity5 said recently			1
his unpopular budget cutbacks have met with stiff political resistance and strikes at home			0
overseas , the @entity6 prime minister is trying to win support for greater regulation over certain forms of financial speculation that analysts say have made his country 's debt crisis worse			1
among other things , @entity5 is asking @entity77 and other leaders to restrict the use of credit default swaps , which are insurance contracts -- the same kind of contracts that pushed insurance giant @entity84 ( @entity84 ) to the brink of collapse			1
two weeks ago , @entity88 chairman @entity87 said the @entity88 is looking into actions taken by @entity90 and other @entity92 firms that may have contributed to @entity6 's debt problems			2
@entity87 's comment came in response to a question posed by @entity98 chairman @entity97 , @entity99 , who asked about @entity77 banks and hedge funds making financial bets that the @entity6 government will default on its loans			1
@entity90 and other banks have been in the news over reports they secretly helped raise $ 1 billion in credit for @entity6 in a way that was off the balance sheet , and that they helped hide the country 's debt woes from @entity45 regulators			1
the @entity116 reported recently that some of these same banks also were making side bets that @entity6 would default on loans it owes @entity77 banks and hedge funds			1
by betting in favor of default , the @entity77 banks and hedge funds would win whether @entity6 pays off its loans or not			1
@entity97 asked whether @entity87 thought there should be limits on the use of these types of bets to prevent firms from creating intentional runs against governments			0
" the rising price of these contracts contribute to an atmosphere of crisis , making it even more difficult for the @entity6 government , in my opinion , to borrow , " @entity97 said			2
@entity87 noted the similarity of the situation of banks making bets to hedge against @entity6 debt to banks that made bets to hedge against real estate debt , which imploded @entity84			0
" the poster child for that would be the capital arrangements that banks took out for @entity84 , " he said			0
" derivatives have a legitimate purpose , but if they 're used to distort accounting results or regulatory ratios , that needs to be addressed			0
" @entity156 is considering legislation to make such financial bets more transparent			0
@entity5 has asked @entity77 and @entity10 authorities to crack down on financial speculators who benefited from taxpayer bailouts only to turn around and profit by exacerbating his country 's debt crisis			1
" enough is enough , " he told an audience at the @entity168 on monday			0
@entity1 's @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
