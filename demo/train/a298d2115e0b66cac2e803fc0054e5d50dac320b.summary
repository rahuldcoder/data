-- civil rights groups filed a complaint this week against a federal judge in @entity4 after she allegedly said during a lecture that some minorities are prone to violence			1
judge @entity8 , who serves on the 5th @entity9 and was a @entity12 - era @entity11 frontrunner , allegedly made the comment while speaking on the death penalty to @entity15 at the @entity16 in february			1
the @entity15 describes itself on its website as " a group of conservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of legal order			2
" in her remarks , @entity22 also is alleged to have said race plays no role in the administration of the death penalty , but certain ethnic groups commit certain types of crimes more often than others			1
civil rights groups , including the @entity34 , say @entity22 ' comments reveal a strong ethnic bias			1
they are pushing for an investigation that could lead to her removal from the bench			0
the @entity34 is an @entity42 bar association in @entity43			0
its president , @entity44 , told @entity0 that some attendees were shocked at what they heard and later complained			0
" the reaction in the room when she made these remarks was one of shock , surprise , and offense , " according to one account that the legal association collected from some of the attendees			0
the @entity15 itself , however , called the allegations " frivolous accusations			0
" @entity62 : blacks busted for marijuana at much higher rates than whites according to the some of the accounts in the complaint , the judge said , " racial groups like african - americans and @entity73 are predisposed to crime			1
" they are " ' prone to commit acts of violence , " she said , according to the complaint			2
when challenges to her comments arose , she allegedly countered them by saying that " blacks and @entity73 " outnumber " anglos " on death row			2
@entity44 says such comments reveal strong predispositions sitting judges should not harbor			0
" we expect that they 're going to be fair , impartial , not that they have predetermined their case , " she said			0
a representative from the court , which is headquartered in @entity94 , declined to comment to @entity0 , and said @entity22 also is " not making any comment regarding the matter			2
" @entity22 was on president @entity12 's short list for the @entity98 @entity11 in 2005 , though legal observers remarked at the time that her reputation has a staunch conservative -- firmly upholding the death penalty and vocally critical of the @entity104 decision , among other issues -- hurt her odds			1
" the decision for which @entity22 is really best known is her opinion saying , ' while i 'm a lower court judge , i will apply @entity104 , but i think it was wrongly decided and should be overruled , ' " @entity11 expert @entity107 told @entity0			1
" that really typifies her role as a lower court judge but signals what she would do if she became a @entity11 justice			1
