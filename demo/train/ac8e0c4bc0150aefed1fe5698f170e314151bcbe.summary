-- @entity1 has ordered the recall of potentially contaminated milk imported from @entity4 after @entity5 , the world 's largest dairy exporter , found in its products bacteria that can cause botulism			1
with nearly 90 per cent of @entity1 's imported milk coming from @entity4 and @entity5 by far the biggest single supplier , @entity10 's response to the dairy scare is being closely watched			1
@entity14 , @entity4 's trade minister , initially told state broadcaster @entity15 that @entity1 had banned imports of all milk powder , a move he deemed " absolutely appropriate "			1
but later on sunday a @entity4 official said the actual @entity1 measures had been more limited			2
on its website , the @entity1 quarantine authority said it had ordered close inspections of all dairy imports from @entity4			2
it demanded that four companies recall products that might have been affected by contaminated milk , including @entity30 , @entity1 's biggest beverage producer			1
it also issued a warning to consumers over three batches of @entity36 infant formula made in @entity4			0
@entity4 exports almost $ 9.5bn of dairy products a year , and nearly a fifth of that goes to @entity1			2
even without an outright ban , the image of @entity4 dairy in @entity1 is at risk			2
" for a long time , @entity4 has marketed its products overseas as being ' 100 per cent pure , ' and this has been especially true of its dairy products , " said @entity1 's state - owned xinhua news agency			1
" however , @entity5 has had a series of problems and this is beginning to shake the confidence of some @entity1 consumers in its ' 100 per cent pure ' milk powder			2
" the quest for safe milk powder has become a top concern for new parents in @entity1 after a 2008 scandal in which domestic producers sold melamine - tainted infant formula , killing six babies and making thousands ill. @entity1 demand for imported milk powder has soared since that scandal , and places from @entity65 to the @entity66 have imposed limits on the number of cans sold to individuals after customers loaded up on supplies to resell in @entity1			1
@entity5 's growth strategy is focused on @entity1 , where it is seeking to expand its business with the launch of its @entity78 brand infant milk formula later this year			1
last year @entity1 accounted for 10 per cent of group revenues of almost nz $ 20bn ( $ 15.7bn )			0
the latest scare began when @entity5 revealed on saturday that three batches of a @entity4 - made whey protein had tested positive for clostridium , a bacteria that can cause botulism			1
the farmers co-operative said the whey concentrate , manufactured in may last year , may have been contaminated by a dirty pipe at a processing plant			0
@entity5 said the 38 tonnes of contaminated concentrate had been bought by eight customers for use in a number of products including infant formula , milk powder and sports drinks			0
it was then mixed with other ingredients to produce 870 tonnes of product sold in a number of markets including @entity4 , @entity102 , @entity1 and @entity103			0
mr @entity14 said @entity4 authorities were working with the company " to identify and trace all potentially affected products and then inform regulators around the world "			0
the head of @entity5 has flown to @entity1 for a round of meetings with officials			0
the botulism scare is the second contamination issue involving @entity5 this year			0
in january the company said it had found traces of a potentially toxic chemical used in fertiliser in some of its products			0
@entity5 said there had been no reports of any illness related to the whey protein			0
@entity125 , head of @entity5 's @entity4 milk products division , said the company was confident all of the affected product had either been recalled , secured or did not pose a risk to health because the bacteria would have been killed in the manufacturing process			1

nearly 90 *%* of @entity1 's imported milk comes from @entity4
@entity138 ordered after @entity5 found bacteria that can cause botulism
botulism can result in *paralysis* and *respiratory* *failure* , according to @entity145 .
