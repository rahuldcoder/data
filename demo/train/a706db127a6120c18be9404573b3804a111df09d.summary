a little more than 20 years ago , @entity0 was an arid desert outpost on the shores of the @entity4			1
today , world famous architecture rises high above the city 's streets , vast columns of cars roar along highways that reach out to its ever expanding suburbs while offices for some of the world 's largest firms populate the flash new business district downtown			0
it has been a truly remarkable transformation in such a short space of time			0
the next stage of @entity0 's development will see it host the @entity25 in 2020 , an event that has added a further dose of fuel to the booming construction sector that has made these changes possible			1
residential and commercial property prices are on the rise as a result -- but so are fears of a property collapse like that of 2009 which resulted in @entity0 being bailed out by neighboring @entity37			1
global real estate firm @entity38 calculates that property prices rose by 27.7 % between march 2013 and march 2014 , although the speed of this surge slowed in the first quarter of this year			1
a new bubble ? according to @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity49 director of the @entity50 , the specter of instability is one that must be monitored closely			0
" you do see in an increase in property prices , real estate prices in @entity0 and these are things to watch out for , " @entity46 said			1
" overall inflation rates in the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) ... remain quite manageable , these are the areas you quite rightly pointed out are where you need to keep a vigilant eye			0
" but alongside these words of caution comes optimism as well			0
the @entity50 predicts approximately 5.5 % growth for @entity0 between 2014 and 2019			1
this figure that is expected to rise to 8 % in 2020 , the year of the @entity66			2
still , the authorities have moved to cool the property market , perhaps aware of the dangers of speculators looking to make a quick buck and driving up prices in the process			1
" the @entity0 government raised the transfer tax from 2 % to 4 % ( making ) property transactions more expensive and less attractive to flippers , " said @entity74 , regional ceo of real estate and financial services firm @entity77			1
on top of this " the @entity87 bank introduced new loan to value proportions on mortgage lending and some of the developers have been introducing their own regulations , " @entity83 added			0
playground of the rich but with no corporate tax and stable governance in the @entity97 , the well - to - do property investors keep on coming			2
@entity0 is a growing travel hub between east and west while luxury property like the @entity103 and year round warm weather ensures it retains a big appeal to the global elite			1
estate agent @entity106 is responsible for some of @entity0 's most exclusive properties through his company @entity109 and believes that high - net - worth clients are undeterred by the rising prices			1
" for a lot of our clients the driver seems to be lifestyle			0
" some of our clients are @entity119 guys ... they like seafront properties so the @entity121 treats them well			0
our @entity57 clients they like penthouses , @entity0 marina downtown that kind of area			2
" the @entity127 ( and ) @entity129 clients we have they like a bit more privacy so they tend to go for the @entity133 properties			0
" the other @entity0 for those with less cash to splash purchasing sales have slowed , however			2
rents have surged on average by 20 % year on year , according to commercial property consultants @entity140			1
" the issue for @entity0 is affordability , " said @entity141 of @entity142			2
" @entity145 is going up not just housing prices			0
