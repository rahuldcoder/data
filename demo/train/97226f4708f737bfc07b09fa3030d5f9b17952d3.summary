-- since her debut with the @entity3 at the age of eight , @entity1 has grown through the weight of expectation to become one of the world 's great violinists			1
now aged 31 , @entity10 was born in @entity11 to a composer and music teacher of @entity15 descent			1
she first dabbled with the piano at the age of three , before opting for the violin a year later			2
by five she had been accepted into @entity21 's prestigious @entity20 for @entity22			2
by her own acknowledgment , the world of grand orchestras and opera houses that she has so long inhabited can be " very formal " and " exclusive			2
" this perhaps goes some way to explain her choice of destination for her " @entity34 " challenge : @entity35			1
here , in the hot - blooded @entity38 capital , she would meet with local band " @entity40 , " to learn first - hand the sensual and mysterious art of tango			1
see more @entity43 during her visit , @entity10 was challenged to produce a fusion of sound that blended the traditions of western classical music with tango 's emotionally raw and folksy heritage			1
she says that the process has given her performance a new - found sense of intimacy that she 's carried ever since			1
in her own words , @entity10 tells the story of her @entity34			1
@entity1 : i 've been trained as a classical violinist my entire life			1
it 's all about structure , all about technique			0
it 's very much a polished profession			0
but tango music , although it has some classical elements , is very sexy and rough and , in a way , from the earth			1
when you walk along the streets of @entity35 , fun is in the air			1
you see children with barely anything on their feet playing soccer , and there is music on every corner			0
they are playing all sorts of @entity84 sounds ; they 're all dancing and drinking ; they 're enjoying life ; they are loving life			0
one of the cornerstones of tango is definitely the dancing , so i first met up with dance instructor @entity92			1
now , i 'm not really a dancer			0
i 'm a very physical performer when i 'm on stage , but of course tango is a completely different thing to thrusting around when you 're performing as a violinist			1
i learned that the best tango dancers move not just with their legs and arms , but from their guts			1
that 's the sign of a true art form , and it 's the source of so much beauty , so much soul and passion			0
even though i absolutely can not dance -- just watch the footage ! -- i always thought that to experience the whole picture , you really have to open up your vulnerabilities , and sort of take that risk			0

it 's not about being always metronomically on time , it 's about spontaneity and freedom			0
i 've worked , of course , with a piano and an orchestra before -- but never with a band			0
all of a sudden i find myself rehearsing with the " @entity40 , " an extremely talented local tango group			1
so there i was , playing songs i 'd never played before , alongside instruments i 'd never heard before , with a group i 'd never met before -- it was thrilling ! the piece we chose for our fusion was by @entity136 -- the biggest name in the history of tango			1
the tune itself is very famous -- it 's used in all these movies , you name it , any famous tango scene			2
but as far as i know , there is no version for a band with a solo violinist , so i asked a composer friend of mine to make an arrangement for us			2
i was really thrilled with the result			0
we performed it in this intimate little club and it felt so immediate			0
everyone was there , drinking wine , dancing , looking so happy			0
there were no rigid rules , none of this " clap here , oh you have to be quiet here			0
" instead , the audience were whistling and yelling and clapping along -- it felt like they were right up there with us			2
literally , if i just stretched my arm , i could touch them , they were so close			0
that sort of intimacy , that sort of physical closeness , the fact that they were dancing when we were playing , i just thought was so beautiful			2
" @entity179 " can often turn out badly -- i can think of some fusion cuisine that i wish i could forget ! but when each side brings just the right balance of their experience , their culture and personality , then i think it can be magical -- and the only way you know it has worked is when everyone has a smile on their face			2
classical music is one of the world 's longest - standing traditional forms of music - making out there -- and i do n't think it will , or should , change over night			0
there is a sort of purity in what classical musicians do that i cherish very much and want to preserve			0
but the big thing that i really took from this experience is that sense of connecting with the audience			1
quite often , in grand concert halls where everyone is wearing elegant ball gowns and black tails -- that kind of old - @entity216 glamor -- it can feel like there is a big distance between the audience and the performers , a sense of " look , but do n't touch			1
" but with @entity38 tango , it 's the opposite			2
they are saying " please touch , please come into and share my world			0
" now , every concert that i do , i try to utilize that , i try to connect with every single last person in the balcony on an emotional and personal level .			0
