the @entity1 government issued rules on friday for the first time allowing banks to legally provide financial services to state - licensed marijuana businesses			1
the @entity7 issued a memorandum to prosecutors that closely follows guidance last august largely limiting federal enforcement priorities to eight types of crimes			0
these include distribution to children , trafficking by cartels and trafficking to states where marijuana is n't legal			2
if pot businesses are n't violating federal law in the eight specific priorities , then banks can do business with them and " may not " be prosecuted			1
the @entity26 's @entity25 ( @entity25 ) issued guidelines that director @entity28 said was intended to signal that " it is possible to provide financial services " to state - licensed marijuana businesses and still be in compliance with federal anti-money laundering laws			1
the guidance falls short of the explicit legal authorization that banking industry officials had pushed the to government provide			0
opinion : why @entity39 's push to legalize pot is a good thing but because marijuana remains illegal under federal law , classified alongside heroin as among the most dangerous substances , officials say this is as far as the government can go			1
@entity28 said the government ca n't give any legal guarantees and acknowledged that some financial firms wo n't likely choose to do business with pot businesses			0
marijuana has been legalized for recreational and other uses under state laws in @entity56 and @entity55			1
eighteen other states and the @entity39 allow marijuana use for medicinal purposes			2
attorney general @entity60 said recently that he was moved to act as " an attempt to deal with reality that exists in these states			0
" speaking at the @entity65 's @entity64 last month , @entity60 said forcing marijuana businesses to be cash businesses , because they ca n't access banks , was a public safety problem			2
" huge amounts of cash , substantial amounts of cash , just kind of lying around with no place for it to appropriately deposited is something that would worry me from just a law enforcement perspective , " he said			0
@entity25 's legal guidance creates two new categories for banks to report transactions with marijuana businesses			2
all transactions will be labeled as " suspicious " and banks will have to file so - called @entity81			0
those transactions that banks believe are legal marijuana business can be reported to @entity25 as " marijuana limited " transactions			2
those that banks believe may be illegal would be filed as " marijuana priority " transactions and would generate further scrutiny from regulators			1
up in smoke : @entity95 administration 's pot politics problem reaction to friday 's announcement in areas where marijuana is legal , at least in some form , was mixed			0
@entity101 -- executive director of the @entity102 , the largest marijuana business association in @entity56 -- said members were pleased with the decision			2
" while we believe today 's guidance should provide banks some of the assurances they need to begin doing business with the marijuana industry , it does n't solve all the problems , " @entity101 said in a statement			1
@entity101 's group wants @entity117 to approve pending legislation that would " provide certainty for banks and allow our industry to operate just like any other business , " he said			0
yet @entity56 's governor , @entity123 , noted concerns because " it appears the language does not provide the clarity that @entity56 banks are seeking to provide basic banking services to the emerging marijuana industry			1
" " while we understand the federal government is in a difficult position , we also hope it realizes that compelling a new industry to conduct all their transactions in cash is an invitation to corruption and criminal activity , " @entity123 said			0
" we hope that @entity117 will act to resolve the risk and liability that @entity56 banks are being asked to accept			1
" and @entity141 , president and ceo of the @entity143 , said the new rules are n't enough to reassure banks			0
" while we appreciate the efforts by the @entity7 and @entity25 , guidance or regulation does n't alter the underlying challenge for banks , " he said			0
" as it stands , possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law , and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctions			1

governor says new rules do n't provide " the clarity that @entity56 banks are seeking "
justice and @entity26 *departments* issue first rules on providing financial services
there are still areas of marijuana transactions that are illegal under federal law
marijuana has been legalized in @entity56 and @entity55 ; 18 states allow medicinal use
