-- before i applied for the @entity3 program , i thought i knew quite a bit about the sport of triathlon			1
i had volunteered at a few races , helping athletes navigate the courses , and i even witnessed newly crowned world champions crossing the finish line			2
but what i knew , or thought i knew , was from the perspective of an outsider and very superficial			2
i really had no idea about the training that these athletes had gone through to prepare for their races			1
as with most things in life , seeing and doing are two very different things			2
i 've already written about my struggles with running , so you know that worried me from the beginning			2
but i 've changed as an athlete			0
the aches and pains are mostly gone now , and as long as i beat the heat and fuel my body , my running workouts are amazing			0
i 've learned to listen to my body throughout the day -- especially during and after a workout -- and my successes have surprised me			1
follow the @entity36 " with this interactive information is a powerful thing , and what i 've learned from my coaches and what i 've learned about myself has turned even me into a runner			1
i think many of my past problems resulted from trying to go too fast , too soon			0
in the past , when i started to see success , i wanted more , and that usually led to injury derailing my progress			0
i 've learned how to build my base endurance slowly and teach my body how to train with a slow and steady progression			1
i 've learned that you should never increase your distance more than 10 % per week so that your body has time to adjust to the increased workload			1
i 've been cycling for a few years , and i thought that would be my strongest discipline			0
however , i learned more about cycling at our may training camp in @entity58 than i thought possible			1
i learned the basics of riding in a " paceline " with my teammates and coaches , how to better control my bike and about the importance of keeping the pedals turning even when coasting ( the " soft pedal " )			1
who knew that central @entity58 was such a hilly place ? i learned quickly			1
after climbing some of those never - ending hills , i 'm a better climber and a better cyclist			0
behind the scenes : training for a triathlon and that leads me to the pool			1
@entity75 has become my nemesis -- and my biggest area of opportunity			0
before starting this journey , i thought i could swim			0
i was wrong ! my first attempts at swimming in a lap pool looked like i was " fighting the water , " to paraphrase my coach			0
it 's much harder to swim when you 're trying to keep your head out of the water the entire time			1
the freestyle stroke , the breathing and everything else about swimming was completely foreign to me			0
as with the other disciplines , i 've learned to swim with the guidance of my coach and through lots of trial and error			2
constantly practicing the exhale under water while only putting my face in the water or " bobbing " at the deep end of the pool has taught me how to control my breathing better			0
for me , the key to swimming was learning to relax			0
now that i can better control my breathing , my workouts have finally become aerobic activities			0
to make my personal journey even more exciting , my girlfriend and a few of my closest friends have committed to taking a similar journey with me			2
they have started training and will be there in @entity117 , @entity118 , not just cheering me on but racing their first triathlons as well			2
now i 'm able to share what i 've learned with those closest to me			2
i often pass on simple tips , such as " slow down and focus on your form			0
" there 's no hurry when you 're training ; i 've learned that once my form is good , i 'm much more efficient when i pick up the pace			1
10 ways to act like a champion when i look back at the guy who first submitted an @entity133 to @entity0 , i thought i knew a bit about triathlons			1
but really i had no idea			0
the training once foreign to me is now a major part of my daily life , and i 'm excited to say it 's become a part of the lives of many people around me as well			1
i 've grown as an athlete and as a person , and i 'm learning how to train my mind as well as my body			0
when i cross the finish line in @entity117 , i 'll cross with my teammates , my family and my friends			1
we will have all shared a similar journey , and we will all become triathletes together			0
