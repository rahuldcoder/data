-- it has been an eventful few weeks for space news			1
first came the launch failure of an unmanned @entity6 rocket and cargo spacecraft bound for the @entity7 , which started a conversation in the media about the wisdom of relying on commercial carriers for transporting cargo ( and later , crew ) to the space station			1
days later came the fatal crash of @entity18 's @entity17 during a flight test			2
the media discussion expanded to include the question of whether it would be ethical to launch members of the general public to space in the future , as nonprofessionals seeking the experience			2
regardless of the misconceptions ( @entity30 has always relied upon commercial companies to design and manufacture its spacecraft and rockets ) and arguments either way , the fact is that the public suddenly became aware that we are doing a lot of things in space			2
some learned for the first time that we have a space station and that science and @entity47 education work is being performed aboard			2
others were surprised that @entity49 are still flying into space and participating in exploration plans			1
then came the new blockbuster movie " interstellar " just a week after the @entity18 crash			2
it is setting box office records , reinforcing space as the subject on people 's minds			1
and now , the @entity62 lander is capturing the public 's imagination			1
it has apparently accomplished a major first : a soft landing onto the surface of a comet			1
finally , a success story , a positive one that gets people 's attention about space exploration ! usually only space mishaps and tragedies are able to push aside reality shows			1
these events show two of the major facets of exploration : risk and the wonder of discovery			1
they also show the power of risk and exploration as pop culture			2
now that we have a success to celebrate , let me expand on what @entity62 ( part of the @entity94 spacecraft and mission ) is about , and trying to accomplish			1
first , congratulations to the @entity98 and the @entity94 team ! it has been a long time coming			0
the operations team has been working for over 10 years on the program			0
launched in march 2004 , the @entity94 spacecraft reached comet @entity104 in august 2014 , having traveled more than 500 million kilometers			0
it then began a 17 - month mission			0
at this distance , it takes a signal ( traveling at the speed of light ) about half an hour to travel one - way to or from @entity113			1
the @entity49 has a small part in this mission , as some @entity30 instruments are onboard			0
we applaud the success of our @entity119 partners , and this is just another example of what we can accomplish through international cooperation			0
@entity62 was released on november 12 and began a seven - hour controlled descent to the comet surface			1
at approximately 1600 gmt , the lander touched down , despite a few technical glitches , which added to the drama ( during the descent , control jets failed to activate )			0
after landing , there was jubilation before a second problem was detected			0
harpoons were to be fired downward into the comet , to help anchor the lander to the surface			0
these units failed to fire , and telemetry indicated that the lander " bounced " and apparently settled onto another spot on the comet			0
this is because the comet , being only about 4 kilometers in width , has very low gravity			0
the escape velocity off of it is only 0.5 meters per second , so it would take only a little jump by an astronaut to go flying off into space			0
the fear is that @entity62 may have bounced off			1
what is the purpose of landing on the comet ? besides the technical and operational lessons learned from this event , there is serious science to be had			2
there are theories that comets helped seed the @entity113 with most of its water , and indeed , perhaps with the basic chemical building blocks of life itself			1
@entity62 , if successful , will analyze the comet soil and determine the quantities of water , nucleic and amino acids present			1
these data will help shed light upon these theories of comet seeding			0
if supported , the implication is that this likely happened in many other places in the universe as well			0
in short , @entity62 and @entity94 are poised to help answer fundamental questions on one possible mechanism of the creation of life			1
as of this writing , the fate of @entity62 is unknown			2
after its landing bounce , it apparently landed in a place where the antennae are not pointed toward @entity113			1
so , no signal can be received for several hours , until the rotation of the comet brings the antennae back into alignment			0
maybe this is not all bad			0
the drama of whether the lander survived and did n't bounce back off the comet just might keep the public engaged long enough to also become interested in the science that the spacecraft might return			0

space has been in the news with a recent rocket *explosion* and a spaceship crash
@entity203 : finally , we hear of positive news with the landing of @entity62 probe on a comet
he says this is a major feat and success that gets people *excited* about space exploration
@entity203 : @entity62 is poised to help answer *important* questions about creation of life on @entity113
