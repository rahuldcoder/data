" it is natural causes			0
it is a natural death , and also the report explains the process of natural selection			2

at least one @entity3 environmental group has said loud sounds from nearby oil exploration could be to blame for the dolphins ' deaths			1
" we see that in their bodies there are air bubbles caused by heavy pressure			2
these animals are underwater holding their breath , facing a sudden and violent noise			0
these animals release nitrogen , and this forms the bubbles that end up destroying living cells , " @entity82 of the @entity83 for the @entity84 told @entity85 this month			0
