-- unlike popular period drama " @entity4 , " any chatting in " @entity2 " takes place after a good brawl , in a brothel or over a dead body in the morgue -- not a cup of tea			1
teeth - jarring fights and the gruesome discovery of a " ripped tart " in the shadow - filled streets of @entity17 's @entity16 are the first glimpses viewers have of @entity21 's new crime drama , all set to the eerie soundtrack of a grating violin			1
so if your favorite part of " @entity4 " is anticipating the war between former co-conspirators @entity29 and @entity31 or mr. @entity33 ' violent side , this visceral series might be more your style			1
set in 1889 , " @entity2 " explores the gritty aftermath of the @entity37 murders in @entity38			1
the @entity40 police force works tirelessly to keep chaos , and even more crime , from overtaking the streets			0
viewers will see the seedy side of @entity17 through three main @entity40 policemen , played by @entity47 ( " @entity51 , " " @entity52 " ) , @entity48 ( " @entity49 " ) and @entity50 ( " @entity53 " )			1
the eight - part series premieres at 9 p.m. et saturday on @entity21			1
" copper " : bringing 1864 @entity56 to life , grit and all series creator and writer @entity60 ( " mistresses " ) wanted to tap into how the @entity37 murders still resonate today			1
his goal , he said , was to show the ways the horrific crimes affected life in @entity17 , not to answer the mystery of @entity37 's identity			1
" i was more fascinated by the @entity17 folklore , and the idea of a very old city like ours having this extra life that these stories give it , " @entity60 said			1
" real things happen and then they become embedded in the mythic strata of our city			0
rather than offer any solutions , what we 're trying to show is the place where that myth first embedded itself			0
" he had to draw on a balance of research and his own imagination , creating a universe that feels new even for fans of @entity90 's " @entity91 " or @entity21 's modern - day series take , " @entity38			1
" in another twist , @entity60 did n't want to lead the series with well - known @entity96 chief inspector @entity95 , often the main character in other ripper stories			2
instead , he chose the real - life boss of @entity40 , inspector @entity99 , played by @entity47			0
" we wanted @entity99 to be a different kind of copper , somebody who was affected by the work he did , but that it did n't make him maudlin			0
@entity47 gives you great presence , but at the same time , he gives you such soul , i think			0
he brings a solid sense of integrity about everything that he does			0
" @entity95 is an integral part of the @entity37 story , so he 's included as a supporting character , portrayed " beautifully " by @entity116 as a man that has been broken by something , @entity60 said			1
in the first episode , @entity99 talks about trying to move forward , and while they tried to do everything to find the @entity37 , all that matters is that the murderer is gone			1
the ripper is not going to own @entity99 's life anymore			2
it is one of @entity60 's favorite scenes			2
" that felt powerful , not just for @entity99 , but it was a broader message for the whole show -- we 're not going to get ourselves hung up on who @entity37 is , but really concentrate on the streets that he influenced so much			1
" immediately after the @entity37 murders , sensationalism , fear and a desire for normalcy all swirled together in @entity38			1
the @entity141 's efforts to contain the hysteria is evident in the characters of @entity99 , his right hand man , sgt. @entity144 ( @entity48 ) and capt. @entity145 ( @entity50 )			2
@entity145 is an @entity146 in the distinctly @entity148 show , playing an @entity150 detective that 's hiding in @entity38 and living in a brothel , maintaining a contemptuous relationship at best with the madam , @entity154			2
he has a taste for vice and a handy skill with early forensics as a former @entity160 surgeon			0
@entity145 's character , like the others , is fraught with duality			2
combined with @entity99 and @entity144 , their conflict , friction and chemistry creates a compelling dynamic			0
" he fits into the story by not fitting in , " @entity50 said			0
" in some ways , he can be a surrogate for the @entity146 audience looking at that time and place			0
at the same time , he represents their perception of @entity146 at the time -- he 's the @entity176			0
" although he ambles around @entity38 in his brown hat and green jacket with a six - shooter strapped to his waist , it was the mustache ( he would never grow one for himself ) , and @entity60 's larger - than - life concept of @entity145 , that made things come alive for @entity50			0
" @entity60 has a way of writing that puts you right there , " he said			0
" i think it 's a new voice that people have n't heard written for that time			0
set design , costuming -- everything was conspiring to make you believe that 's where you were			0
" the crew filmed the entirety of the show in @entity200 , rather than @entity17 , and @entity60 gives credit to production designer @entity202 and costume designer @entity203 for helping create the authentic edgy atmosphere of @entity38			1
today , there is little inspiration to be found in the office buildings that now cover the @entity16 's historic streets , with the exception of a stray alleyway or two , but the finished product resembles what @entity60 and his team imagined			1
the @entity215 costuming is elegant , while the streets are cramped and dirty with notorious interludes and crime to be found in every alley			0
" it was an insane time , in an insane area -- an intense pressure cooker , " @entity50 said of the era			0
while @entity17 has evolved immensely from that infamous time , the cloak of its history is still tangible for visitors and residents alike , @entity60 said			2
that 's what he hopes to capture in " @entity2			1
" " they can get a sense of this city of ours , of @entity17 , and of all the kind of the darkness that lies behind its streets and gives the city its flavor -- the history of terrible things but rather wonderful people who have lived here throughout those times			2

" @entity2 " is a gritty new period drama from the @entity21
unlike " @entity4 , " the series focuses on @entity17 's notorious @entity16
rather than guessing @entity37 's identity , it shows the hysterical aftermath
