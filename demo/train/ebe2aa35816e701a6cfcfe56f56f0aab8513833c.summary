-- when president @entity2 proposed his stimulus in january 2009 , the economy was in a freefall , losing more than 700,000 jobs a month			1
the immediate cause of the plunge was the freezing up of the financial system after the collapse of @entity11 , but the deeper cause was the loss of demand after the collapse of the housing bubble			1
the bubble had been driving the economy both directly and indirectly			1
the unprecedented run - up in house prices led to a record rate of construction , with about 2 million homes built at the peak in 2005			2
in addition , the $ 8 trillion in housing equity created by the bubble led to an enormous consumption boom			1
people saw little reason to save for retirement when their home was doing it for them			0
the banks also made it very easy to borrow against bubble - generated equity , which many people did			2
as a result , the personal saving rate fell to 3 % in the years 2002 - 07			2
the bubble also indirectly enriched state and local governments with higher tax revenue			1
and there was a mini-bubble in nonresidential real estate , but that came to an end in 2008 as well			0
the economy had already been in recession for nine months before the collapse of @entity11 because the bubble was deflating , but the @entity11 bankruptcy hugely accelerated the pace of decline			1
this was the context in which @entity2 planned his stimulus package before he even entered the @entity56			2
at that point , most economists still did not recognize the severity of the downturn , just as they had not seen the dangers of the housing bubble that had been building over the previous six years			1
the @entity64 projections , which were very much in the mainstream of the economics profession , showed a combined drop in gdp for 2008 and 2009 of 1 % , before the economy resumed growth again in 2010			2
this is with no stimulus			0
by contrast , the economy actually shrank by 3.1 % in those years , even with the stimulus beginning to kick in by the spring of 2009			1
given this background , it was easy to see that the stimulus was far too small			0
it was designed to create about 3 million jobs , which might have been adequate given the @entity64 projections			0
since the package @entity84 approved was considerably smaller than the one requested , the final version probably created about 2 million jobs			0
this was a very important boost to the economy at the time , but we needed 10 million to 12 million jobs to make up for jobs lost to the collapse of the bubble			1
the arithmetic on this is straightforward			0
with the collapse of the bubble , we suddenly had a huge glut of unsold homes			2
as a result , housing construction plunged from record highs to 50 - year lows			1
the loss in annual construction demand was more than $ 600 billion			1
similarly , the loss of $ 8 trillion in housing equity sent consumption plunging			1
people no longer had equity in their homes against which to borrow , and even the people who did would face considerably tougher lending conditions			0
the drop in annual consumption was on the order of $ 500 billion			1
the collapse of the bubble in nonresidential real estate cost the economy another $ 150 billion in annual demand , as did the cutbacks in state and local government spending as a result of lost tax revenue			1
this brings the loss in annual demand as a result of the collapse of the bubble to $ 1.4 trillion			1
compared with this loss of private sector demand , the stimulus was about $ 700 billion , excluding some technical tax fixes that are done every year and have nothing to do with stimulus			1
roughly $ 300 billion of this was for 2009 and another $ 300 billion for 2010 , with the rest of the spending spread over later years			1
in other words , we were trying offset a loss of $ 1.4 trillion in annual demand with a stimulus package of $ 300 billion a year			1
surprise ! this was not enough			0
that is not 20/20 hindsight ; some of us were yelling this as loudly as we could at the time			0
it was easy to see that the stimulus package was not large enough to make up for the massive shortfall in private sector demand			2
it was going to leave millions unemployed and an economy still operating far below its potential level of output			0
we are still facing the consequences of an inadequate stimulus			0
the reality is that we have no simple formula for getting the private sector to replace the demand lost from the collapse of the bubble			1
contrary to what @entity168 politicians tell us , private businesses do n't run out and create jobs just because we throw tax breaks at them and profess our love			2
if the government does n't create demand , then we will be doomed to a long period of high unemployment -- just as we saw in the @entity178			0
the government could fill the demand gap by spending on infrastructure , education and other areas , but in a political world where higher spending is strictly verboten , that does n't seem likely			0
the one alternative , which has been successfully pursued by @entity188 , is to reduce the supply of labor through work sharing			0
companies reduce all their employees ' hours and pay so everyone keeps their jobs			0
the government then pays the workers part - time unemployment benefits -- cheaper than paying someone full - time unemployment			0
@entity188 have used this route to lower their unemployment rate to 5.2 % , even though their nation 's growth has been slower than ours			0
some bipartisan baby steps have been taken in this direction ; we will need much more if we are to get back to near full employment any time soon			0
in a world where politics makes further stimulus impossible , work sharing is our best hope			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			2

@entity217 : when stimulus began five years *ago* , we were losing 700,000 jobs a month
@entity217 : underlying cause of the recession was the utter collapse of the housing bubble
he says economy lost $ 8 trillion in housing equity as well as construction jobs , tax revenue
@entity217 : $ 300 billion a year stimulus is *pittance* against loss of $ 1.4 trillion in annual demand
