-- this week , @entity2 vice presidential candidate @entity1 leveled the ultimate insult at president @entity4			1
he said : " the @entity5 years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now			2
" in the modern political era , comparing any @entity9 ( or @entity2 ) president to @entity5 is just about as nasty as a politician can get			1
the characterization of @entity5 might not be fair -- as many historians have started to look again at the accomplishments of his term , such as his initiatives on energy and his role in the peace treaty between @entity21 and @entity22 -- but the poor state of the economy on his watch and trouble in @entity27 and @entity28 left the @entity29 as a symbol of incompetence and failed presidential leadership			0
a different way to think about @entity1 's statement is to ask a question , one that is equally relevant to @entity1 and his future : what is the condition of the @entity2 compared with where it stood in 1980 ? on this front , the comparison might not be so kind to the @entity2			1
after all , when @entity5 's presidency ended , the @entity2 had a number of up - and - coming political stars who would soon remake the political landscape , ranging from @entity48 to @entity49 , both in their prime			1
today , even with the promise of candidates such as @entity55 gov. @entity54 and @entity56 rep. @entity1 , it is unclear whether @entity2 have the same kind of farm team ready to take over @entity59			1
@entity49 expressed conservative ideas in a way that was appealing to a broad spectrum of the country and made the ideas of the right seem like a bridge to the future			0
@entity49 displayed the kind of electoral savvy that was needed to hold together a diverse coalition even when there were significant differences over policy among @entity2			1
he could deflect attacks from his opponents with a turn of the phrase or even a quick smile			0
certainly , presidential candidate @entity79 has revealed the limits of his talent on the campaign trail and his difficulty articulating the same kind of compelling ideological agenda as his predecessors in 1980			0
another way in which republicans are not doing as well is , ironically , a result of their success			0
after holding significant power in the @entity92 or @entity93 for over three decades , @entity2 can no longer claim the same kind of outsider status as they did when @entity49 won office			2
since 1980 , they are a party with a sizable record of their own -- a record that includes high levels of government spending , pork barrel politics , flawed military operations , corruption and unsuccessful economic policies			1
when @entity2 talk about the problems with @entity59 , they must talk about the problems with themselves , not just @entity9			1
they even have a controversial president of their own , @entity107 , who has come to symbolize failures of conservative leadership			0
finally , according to numerous analysts , demographics are no longer working in favor of @entity2			0
while in 1980 @entity2 were riding the wave of a booming @entity115 , @entity9 can now look forward to the expanding minority vote , namely @entity117 , and the movement of highly educated voters into blue states			2
so @entity1 might be right that voters can feel a little of 1980 in 2012 , given that the economic stagnation of today is reminiscent of the malaise in the late 1970s			2
but the @entity2 needs to be careful because their party is not in quite the same shape as it once was			0
and as a result , it might have a harder time repeating @entity49 's success			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			0

@entity131 : @entity1 has " insulted " @entity4 by comparing his presidency to @entity5 's
he has better question : is @entity2 in anything like the position it held in 1980 with @entity49 ?
he says despite gov. @entity54 and others , @entity2 lacks " farm team " to take over @entity59
@entity131 : with spending , wars , *bad* economic policies , @entity2 has its own problems with record
