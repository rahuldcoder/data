-- for some , this week in @entity1 will be consumed by a singing contest			1
a contest where musical ambassadors from all over @entity1 and beyond come together as an instrument for political jockeying ... i mean to showcase their talent in a performance of free expression			1
in either case , it makes this year 's venue -- @entity15 -- a controversial one , but also an excellent opportunity for international advocacy to do some good			1
eurovision is a singing contest whereby each country participant , which includes most countries in @entity1 and others who are members of the @entity25 , like @entity26 and @entity27 , sends musical acts to a competition that pits country against country			1
it should be about the performances			0
but , it is n't			0
it 's @entity1 politics at its most flamboyant			1
and this show has been a curious reflection of regional politics since 1956			0
historically , @entity3 has offered some interesting outlets for citizen voters			2
@entity43 received no votes in 2003 after joining the @entity45 in invading @entity46			0
on the other hand , the contest provided for a coalition with encouraging indications in 2007 when @entity51 won after it nabbed the support of @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , and @entity57			2
this year 's contest is in @entity15 , which is a member of the @entity60			1
the venue is a contested one , both when it comes to the country and the actual site for the competition itself			0
claims of corruption and political repression plague the @entity72 government led by president @entity73			0
the @entity73 government is especially infamous for corruption , and @entity75 rates it as one of the most corrupt governments in the world			0
the @entity73 family is reported to have interests in just about every private sector ( which does not include oil and gas in the public sector ) , including telecoms , construction , real estate , aviation , and mineral mines			0
few were surprised to learn recently that the president is profiting off the @entity3 contest			1
it was recently uncovered by the @entity93 and @entity94 in conjunction with @entity96 that his family appears to have a stake in the company actually constructing the venue			0
@entity15 won the honor of hosting this year 's contest in @entity72 because its singing duo , @entity105 won with their song , " @entity107 " in 2011			1
coincidentally , plenty of people in @entity15 are in fact scared			2
and this reality flies in the face of the polished @entity114 exterior the government transmits to the world			0
the , actually very , autocratic government cracks down on any dissent			1
some reports indicate that the @entity15 government is imprisoning 17 " prisoners of conscience " ; others say it is more like 70			1
these are individuals imprisoned not for a crime but as punishment for their exercise of a fundamental freedom , most often freedom of expression			0
on @entity134 earlier this month , @entity15 's ambassador to the @entity131 , and current @entity133 president , @entity129 told a room of journalists that @entity15 has a " free media " and " does not need world press day			1
" people inazerbaijan tell a different story			0
and embarrassingly , the ambassador was clearly unaware of the occasion			0
the month before , an @entity15 journalist , @entity143 , had been awarded @entity145 's @entity144			1
@entity143 had been unjustly imprisoned in 2007 and released in 2011			0
in another attempt to cut off criticism , the @entity15 government imprisoned two well known bloggers , @entity149 and @entity150 , in 2008			1
the bloggers ' crimes : hooliganism			0
their real crime : a video poking fun at the government 's recent extravagant payment for donkeys			2
the two men -- now known as the donkey bloggers -- were released early , after a coordinated international campaign			0
today among these prisoners of conscience is @entity165 , a former student of the @entity166			0
after the program , @entity165 went home to @entity15 to stand in a parliamentary election			2
he used his campaign platform to call for an end to government corruption			0
the government did not appreciate this , and began hassling him about compulsory military service			2
the @entity177 , of which @entity15 is a member , has called repeatedly for alternative civil service to be permitted			1
the government added constitutional language to provide for alternative service , but in practice does not permit alternative service			2
despite legal deferments and a plea for alternative civil service , @entity165 was sentenced to two years in prison -- the longest prison term observed for this crime			1
with the @entity15 government in violation of the @entity177 , infamous for corruption , notorious for repression against expression , it is indeed ironic that @entity1 's most beloved singing contest is held in @entity15			1
certainly , the @entity15 people are proud of this attention			2
but , this is not just an opportunity for the @entity15 people to shine , @entity3 is also an important opportunity for us all to focus on the host country 's government and to demand reform , which to start should be the release of individuals like @entity165			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210			2

@entity210 says @entity3 is an opportunity for international advocacy to do good
the very autocratic government " cracks down on any dissent , " says @entity210
the @entity177 has called for alternative civil service to be permitted
she says it is ironic that @entity1 's most beloved singing contest is held in @entity15
