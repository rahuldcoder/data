it was with a call for the protection of the weakest in society that @entity4 was officially inaugurated tuesday as the @entity6 's 266th pontiff , before a crowd of tens of thousands bathed in sunlight			1
giving his homily before the throngs in @entity11 , @entity4 showed the humility and concern for ordinary people that have been noted since he became the first @entity15 to be elected pope six days ago			1
what do you think about the new pope ? tell us before he spoke , he was given the official symbols of his papacy : a lamb 's wool shawl , to represent his role as " the good shepherd , " and the @entity28 , to represent his role of spreading the gospel			1
the ring is not solid gold like that of his predecessors , but made of gold - plated silver -- again reflecting his desire for simplicity			0
the pope delivered his homily in @entity40 , rooted in a message of looking after the poor and sick , as well as the natural world			2
he reflected first on the symbolism of the date : this is the day that @entity6 celebrate the @entity47 to honor @entity49 ' father on @entity50 , the carpenter @entity51			0
@entity4 spoke of @entity51 's role in protecting not only @entity49 and @entity53 , but also the church			1
he spoke too of the need to protect " all creation , the beauty of the created world " as instructed by the @entity56 and shown by @entity57 , whose name he took as pope			0
this , he said , " means respecting each of @entity66 's creatures and respecting the environment in which we live			0
it means protecting people , showing loving concern for each and every person , especially children , the elderly , those in need , who are often the last we think about			0
" @entity6 : 5 ways for @entity4 to move forward he warned of the consequences if people do not look after one another			1
" whenever human beings fail to live up to this responsibility , whenever we fail to care for creation and for our brothers and sisters , the way is opened to destruction and hearts are hardened			0
" and he urged those in power to live up to their duties , and to all to avoid evil , hatred and pride			0
" i would like to ask all those who have positions of responsibility in economic , political and social life , and all men and women of goodwill : let us be ' protectors ' of creation , protectors of @entity66 's plan inscribed in nature , protectors of one another and of the environment , " he said			0
kissing babies after his homily , 500 priests dispensed communion to the throngs of locals , pilgrims , tourists and dignitaries gathered for the historic occasion			0
between 150,000 and 200,000 people turned out in and around @entity11 , said the rev. @entity125 , a @entity126 spokesman			1
police in the area told @entity129 there were fewer people than expected but declined to give an estimate			0
pope @entity4 earlier made his way into the square atop an open - top vehicle , spending 17 minutes circling among the crowds in bright sunshine			1
he wore the simple iron cross that he 's had since he was appointed bishop and that he had on when he first appeared to the world as pope			2
and he chose black shoes rather than the red ones favored by @entity144			0
when the gathered faithful held up babies and young children for him to kiss , he obliged			0
he also stepped out of his sport utility vehicle to kiss the head of a man with a physical disability			2
even though at least a dozen security officers in suits walked alongside the suv as he circled the square , his decision to bypass the @entity157 , which his last two predecessors used , was telling			0
the @entity159 afforded him the kind of direct contact with people he has embraced since becoming pope			2
had he been in the @entity157 , he would have been behind bulletproof glass , which was installed in 1981 after an assassination attempt on @entity166 @entity168 priest and @entity129 ireporter @entity167 , who was among those in @entity11 , was enthralled by the spectacle , and the contrasting humility , of the newly elected pontiff			1
" the @entity4 spoke with such passion and force that the words exuded life and thus , as he spoke , there were instances of spontaneous applause , " he said			2
" in the piazza , people who have n't even known each other exchanged smiles , happy that they belonged to one big family			0
" @entity4 called his predecessor , pope @entity144 , monday afternoon to wish him well on the day of the @entity47 and to thank him again for his service			1
@entity144 , in turn , said he had been following the events since @entity4 ' selection closely and assured his closeness in prayer			2
@entity4 's sister prayed he would n't be picked ; now she 's proud style or substance ? the @entity196 which inaugurated @entity4 as bishop of @entity198 and marked the official start of his papacy was short , lasting about two hours			1
this was in keeping with the spirit of simplicity embraced by the new pontiff , the @entity126 said before the occasion			2
@entity4 has already made an impression as a pope of the people who is concerned about the welfare of the poor			1
but he inherits a church wracked by a decades - old sexual abuse scandal and claims of corruption in the clergy			0
monsignor @entity216 told @entity129 the @entity6 probably would not have to wait long before the changes in style already seen under @entity4 become changes in substance			2
" it comes down to personnel , " he said			0
" the personnel changes you make in any corporation make all the difference			0
leadership matters -- but then who are the other people who help implement his program ? " the @entity126 said saturday that @entity4 had provisionally confirmed members of the @entity126 hierarchy in their positions , but would take time to reflect before any final appointments are confirmed			1
@entity216 said he believes the key changes are likely to come in the late spring or early summer			0
@entity4 , as a member of the @entity239 , " gets into things " and is tenacious , he said			2
" this is a ' take - charge ' pope , i would say			2

the formal encounters over , @entity4 then went to the barriers around the sides of the basilica to greet priests , nuns and other well - wishers			1
