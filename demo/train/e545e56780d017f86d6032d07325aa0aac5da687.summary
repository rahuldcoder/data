just do n't call it a coup			1
appearing to throw its weight behind an opposition that swarmed @entity7 's @entity6 , the @entity3 military told the country 's civilian government it has until wednesday evening to " meet the demands of the people " or it will step in to restore order			1
in a statement carried nationwide on radio and television , the military called the 48 - hour ultimatum " a final chance to shoulder the burden of a historic moment in our country			0
" but a military spokesman said late monday that the culture of the armed forces -- which dominated the country for decades -- " does n't allow it to adopt the policy of military coups			1
" the statement was meant to push all factions toward quick solutions and a national consensus , and the armed forces are n't looking to be part of the political or ruling circles , the spokesman , col. @entity31 , said in written statement			2
while insisting they want no direct role in national politics , the generals appeared instead to be pressuring @entity43 , @entity3 's first freely elected president , to restructure his government			1
the steps could include reducing the influence of the @entity50 in his cabinet and calling early presidential and parliamentary elections , a source close to highly placed members of @entity3 's leadership told @entity54			1
the protesters in @entity6 , who listened to the military statement on radios and cell phones , cheered as it was read			0
they roared as military helicopters passed overhead at dusk , trailing @entity3 flags and the banners of the armed services			1
after nightfall , they waved flags , honked horns and set off fireworks			0
" everyone is talking as if @entity43 is officially out of power and the @entity50 is officially out of power , and everyone is celebrating , " @entity70 , an @entity3 writer who took part in monday 's protests , told @entity54 's @entity73			1
but @entity43 's office said early tuesday that the military statement " has not yet been reviewed " by the president , adding " @entity3 , by all its power , will not allow the country to go backwards under any circumstances			1
" in the face of the protests , which began over the weekend , five government ministers announced their resignations monday			0
the latest was foreign minister @entity88 , @entity3 's official @entity90 news agency reported			1
@entity43 , a @entity92 - educated @entity91 , was elected @entity3 's president in june 2012			1
he resigned his post as leader of the @entity96 , the political arm of the @entity50 , after winning office , but critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian over his year in power			2
and he has failed to revive @entity3 's economy , which crashed when the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime strongman @entity103 drove tourists away			1
that 's disaffected many of his supporters among @entity3 's poor and middle classes , said @entity109 , director of the @entity110 at the @entity111			1
" that some of the revolutionaries are calling on the army to return to politics is a testament to how polarized @entity3 is a year after the election of @entity43 , " @entity109 said			1
" think of the millions of people who cheered @entity43 after his election			2
think of the millions of @entity3 who pinned their hopes on @entity43			1
a year later , now , the millions of @entity3 who cheered for @entity43 are saying he must go			1
" @entity109 called @entity43 " incompetent " and " a president who is basically his own worst enemy			1
" but he doubted the military would actually step in to depose him , which he said " would plunge @entity3 into a greater legal political and institutional crisis			1
" shortly after the military 's announcement , @entity43 met with prime minister @entity130 and @entity3 's minister of defense and head of the country 's military , gen. @entity136 @entity135 , according to the president 's facebook page			1
it was not immediately known what they discussed , and a late - night news conference planned by the president 's office was canceled			1
the source who discussed the issue with @entity54 said the military is asking @entity43 's government to reduce the influence of the @entity50 and focus on a governing style credible to the majority			1
@entity109 said those changes could include the appointment of an opposition figure as prime minister , the appointment of a new prosecutor - general and opposition - backed amendments to the country 's constitution , which voters approved in december			2
the @entity50 was repressed under @entity103 but is now the most powerful political force in @entity3			2
last week , @entity135 said the army would , if necessary , " prevent @entity3 from slipping into a dark tunnel of civil unrest and killing , sectarianism and the collapse of state institutions			2
" the opposition @entity172 ( " rebel " ) campaign called for nationwide protests , civil disobedience and a march on the presidential palace if @entity43 does n't leave office by tuesday			1
demonstrators say they have collected 17 million signatures -- roughly 4 million more than the number of votes that won @entity43 the presidency -- calling for @entity43 to go			2
the opposition is made up of various groups and loose coalitions , and not all @entity188 protesters agree with the road map the @entity172 campaign is advocating			0
some are loyal to the ousted @entity103 government , while others want the army to intervene			0
that 's brought criticism from observers like @entity198 , a journalism professor at the @entity199 , who says much of the movement is anti-democratic and elitist			0
" the @entity50 has made plenty of mistakes , " @entity198 told @entity54			0
" but in medicine , they talk about triaging			0
if someone goes into the emergency room with a gunshot wound to the chest and a broken arm , the doctors treat the gunshot wound to the chest , not the broken arm			0
" " @entity213 might be a broken arm with their mistakes , " he said , but " this anti-democratic tendency within these circles that is the gunshot wound to the democratic chest , if you will , of @entity3			2
" @entity221 , a former member of parliament and a @entity50 representative , told @entity54 's @entity224 program that the military could be an " honest broker " in a national dialogue			2
he said @entity43 has reached out to opposition leaders many times , but the opposition " is afraid of democracy			2
" " it failed in the previous five elections we had in @entity3 since the revolution , and they do n't want to fail a sixth time , " he said			1
" that 's why they 're going to street politics			0
street politics is not an end in itself			0
it is a means to achieve democracy			0
but they 're not willing to go toward a democratic system			0
" on monday , protesters stormed the main headquarters of the @entity50 , the party that @entity43 led before his election			2
armed with @entity251 cocktails , the mob set the office on fire , shouting , " the people have toppled the regime			0
" at least 16 people were killed and more than 780 were wounded sunday and monday during the unrest in @entity3 , the nation 's health minister said , according to the official @entity3 news agency			1
on friday , @entity262 , a 21 - year - old @entity92 in @entity263 to teach children @entity265 , was stabbed to death while watching the demonstrations , his family said			0
@entity92 student killed in @entity3 was enthralled with region dr. @entity270 told the news agency that eight people alone were killed in clashes at the @entity50 's national headquarters in @entity7			1
all but 182 of the wounded have left the hospital after receiving treatment for their injuries			0
state - funded @entity3 daily @entity280 also reported 46 sexual assaults during @entity188 protests in @entity3 since sunday , citing volunteer group @entity283			2
governments issue warnings against travel to @entity3 opponents say @entity43 's policies also are to blame for a breakdown in law and order and for a gas shortage that has @entity3 waiting at the pumps for hours			1
monday 's military statement seemed to adopt the protesters ' perspective , calling the crisis a grave threat to national security while praising demonstrators as determined and admirable			2
" wasting more time will only lead to more division and fighting which we have and continue to warn against , " the military said in its statement			0
@entity307 : protesters flood @entity7 's streets @entity43 's supporters held smaller rallies monday in other parts of @entity7			1
some of them said he is the people 's choice , that he inherited a broken system and should be given time to fix it			0
" we 're not leaving , and the president is staying , " one supporter told @entity54			0
" we believe in democracy			0
if people do n't like him , they can vote him out in three years			0
" @entity221 said monday that the party might support early parliamentary elections			0
but he said the nation elected @entity43 to a four - year term and should stand by that			0
to do otherwise would disrupt the country 's nascent democracy , he said			0
" it is not fair			0
it is not fair to a democracy , " he said			0
the developments were being closely watched around the region and in the @entity92 , @entity3 's leading ally			1
speaking in @entity339 , @entity92 president @entity338 noted the protests and their demands			0
" our commitment to @entity3 has never been around any particular individual or party			0
our commitment has been to a process , " he said			0
@entity349 provided tens of billions of dollars in military and economic aid to @entity3 under @entity103 and pledged $ 1 billion to the @entity352 government			1
@entity354 spokesman @entity353 told reporters monday that the @entity354 is reviewing the latest statement from the @entity3 military , but no one is sure what will happen " one way or the other " in the next two days			1
