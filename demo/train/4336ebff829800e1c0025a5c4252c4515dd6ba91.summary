-- this election is about the economy -- not social issues or other distractions			1
at least , that 's the mantra we 've consistently heard from conservative candidates this election cycle			2
we heard the same thing during the " @entity11 election " of 2010			0
but it 's an odd insistence from an overwhelmingly social conservative @entity14 party			1
because keep in mind , they 're not disavowing anti-choice beliefs on abortion or opposition to gay rights or any other deeply held hot - button issues			2
they just do n't want to discuss them loudly in an election year			0
it 's almost as if bringing up social issues is impolite			1
but of course , there 's an electoral calculation beneath the impulse to keep them in the closet			0
it is an interesting implicit admission -- that the far - right litmus tests on social issues that seem necessary to win closed partisan primaries also alienate the centrist and independent voters that @entity14 need to win general elections			1
there is no question that fiscal conservatism is what holds the @entity14 coalition together and helps it connect with independent voters concerned about deficits and the debt			1
smaller government and lower taxes are popular promises , particularly if specific cuts are n't spelled out in detail			0
and certainly , the still struggling economy is a cause of frustration and anxiety			0
tell us : where do you stand on abortion ? but all that was true in 2010 , when the tea party revived the @entity14 with promises to refocus it along libertarian lines , ignoring divisive social issues because there were more urgent economic matters at stake			1
two years later , this pitch has lost some of its punch			0
that 's because we can compare the rhetoric to the record			2
and contrary to the libertarian promises , social issues have been front and center , especially in the state legislatures that @entity14 took control over in 2010			1
in 2011 , 24 states passed a record 92 restrictions on abortion , including mandatory ultrasound legislation , waiting periods , insurance restrictions , and abortion bans after 20 weeks of pregnancy			0
the pace continued in 2012			0
opinion : can @entity91 get back on track ? likewise , when @entity14 took control of the @entity95 state legislature , one of the first referendums they put on the ballot was a bid to ban same - sex marriages			1
in @entity104 , three judges who ruled same - sex marriage was constitutional found themselves kicked out of office in 2010 , and another of those judges is being targeted this election cycle , with former presidential candidate @entity108 and @entity110 gov. @entity109 adding their voices to the effort			1
it 's not just a case of unruly conservative state legislatures			2
the @entity14 - controlled @entity118 @entity117 was elected on a similar promise to focus on the economy			1
but less than one month after taking office , conservatives pushed through the first of several efforts to defund @entity125 , even though the long - standing @entity126 already prohibits spending federal money on abortions			2
( the taxpayer money that @entity125 does receive is limited to women 's health services , like breast health exams			0
) with all the promises to cut excess spending , this was an odd place to begin looking for meaningful cuts , unless you recognize that social issues were driving the agenda from the outset			1
by contrast , look at the contortions many conservatives are going through to avoid making the sequester cuts to the @entity144 -- required after congressional negotiators failed to agree on a deficit - reduction plan last fall -- proposing instead that the cuts guaranteed by the bipartisan failure of the super committee come entirely out of entitlement spending			0
@entity151 : dreamers deal a risky roll of dice it 's important to appreciate that social conservatives hold their views dear			2
and good people can disagree on these most difficult and personal issues , particularly abortion			0
vice-presidential nominee @entity161 is a serious deficit hawk who had the courage to put his budget plans in writing , but he is similarly opposed to abortion even in cases of rape and incest and has written extensively about his beliefs in this area			0
that this is deeply held should not distract us from the fact that fewer than 20 % of @entity118 support a constitutional ban on all abortions , as called for in the @entity14 platform			0
the @entity180 formulation of " safe , legal and rare " comes closer to expressing the consensus ; but pro-choice @entity14 are close to being @entity182 -- " republicans in name only " -- hunted out of existence			0
@entity91 has characteristically shown less consistent commitment to social issues			1
he was pro-choice until he started running for president , but now expresses a desire to see @entity190 overturned			0
he once was a financial supporter of @entity125 , but now wants to defund it entirely			0
in addition , the man who once pledged to be better on gay rights than @entity195 now backs the @entity198 - era constitutional ban on same - sex marriage			1
@entity200 : @entity201 on world stage : more hope than change there 's plenty of reason to believe @entity91 reversed his positions for political expedience while trying to win the @entity14 primary -- but there 's no reason to believe he would abandon those new positions if he became president			2
given the conservative congressional record , he 'd likely be faced with social legislation if he took the oath of office			0
is it reasonable to believe he would veto it in a return to moderation ? many of my libertarian friends are content to ignore these inconsistencies while distancing themselves personally from the social - conservative populists in their chosen party			2
there are more urgent issues , they say , especially reducing deficits and debt , which have exploded under president @entity201			0
but i ca n't help but wonder why a serious focus on this front would not have created a tea party rally around the bipartisan @entity240 recommendations , which would have cut taxes , closed loopholes , reduced spending and enacted entitlement reform			1
@entity161 and his @entity14 congressional colleagues on the commission voted against it			0
likewise , it was the @entity11 congressmen who undercut house speaker @entity251 's attempt to forge a grand bargain with @entity201 during the self - inflicted debt - ceiling crisis			2
social issues received earlier and more consistent support on the state legislative and congressional level than serious attempts to reduce the deficit and the debt			1
formerly bipartisan jobs bill proposals put forward by @entity201 -- like a public - private infrastructure bank -- likewise did not move forward , contrary to promises to focus on jobs and improving the economy			2
the bottom line is it makes no sense to pretend that social issues are not on the ballot this fall , along with more pressing issues			1
the record of the past two years suggests that social conservatism is a driving force beneath the @entity11 rhetoric			1
to ignore that fact is to ignore reality , no matter how uncomfortable it is			0
tell us : where do you stand on social issues ? cast your vote with the @entity283 " i 'm voting " app , and be part of the way @entity0 covers the election			1
abortion same - sex marriage the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity293 .			1

@entity293 : conservatives say election about economy , not social issues . really ?
@entity293 : @entity14 at state and federal levels has put social issues ahead of economy repeatedly
he says @entity14 focuses on abortion , same - sex marriage , but runs from action on debt
@entity293 : it 's clear in past 2 years social conservatism a driving force behind tea party rhetoric
