below ground in @entity3 are depending on food , medicine and supplies being dropped to them through a 4 - inch - wide tube			1
what comes out of that tube will have to sustain the men both physically and mentally for a long time -- perhaps four months , experts say -- while a shaft wide enough to pull a man through is drilled			1
the miners already have been trapped for 18 days , since a rockslide inside the @entity17 gold and copper mine cut off their exit route			1
a probe retrieved a note from the miners sunday saying all were alive and well in a cramped , 530 - square - foot ( 50 - square - meter ) shelter			1
they survived by sharing tiny portions of canned fish stored in the shelter room			2
" medics now are beginning to put down glucose water through a tube , first starting off with liquids and rehydrating salts , then in the coming days will put more solid food down , " @entity0 's @entity28 reported tuesday morning from the scene near the town of @entity31 in northern @entity3			1
" but psychologists say really it is the mental health that 's the real thing , " @entity28 added			0
forced confinement for months in a small , dark , hot space with many other people will pose intense psychological and emotional challenges			1
the men will have to help one another , @entity28 said			0
" they have to make sure on a day when somebody is feeling down , depressed , that the others keep him there to cheer him up , " he said			0
@entity50 , former director of the @entity51 , said the situation is challenging on a number of levels , but the @entity3 government seems to be doing everything right			1
it 's the size of a studio apartment , and it 's dark			0
well , now there will be some lights put in , but the conditions were very , very difficult , " he said tuesday morning			2
" you have to deal with bodily functions , and you 've got to deal with that kind of question			0
then you 've got to deal with the psychological impact			2
" now , i think the fact that they 've made it these 18 days is very , very positive			1
but the euphoria of making contact with the surface is going to last a couple days , and then it 's going to be a long slog			1
" @entity50 noted that with current technology , there 's no reason the trapped miners have to be isolated from their families and society during their confinement			2
" these miners are resilient people , but i think also it 's a new era , " he said			2
" and i see no reason why you could n't pass cell phones down to them , or computers , tethered down to them			1
so , we 're in a new day			0
and something will need to be done to divert their attention			0
... how do you come up with things for them to do and arrange things so that they can get their attention diverted from just sitting there waiting ? " added @entity28 : " the families on the surface will also play a role as well , establishing communication with their family members to tell them to keep strong , but above all , to stay patient			0
they could be down there until @entity108			0
" @entity0 's @entity28 , @entity109 and the @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
