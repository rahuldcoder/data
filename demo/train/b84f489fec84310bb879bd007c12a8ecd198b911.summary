-- @entity2 troops ended a hostage crisis at a remote gas facility saturday with one last , bloody assault , @entity2 and @entity7 officials said , after three days of chaos and confusion left dozens dead and fanned fears of a new terror front in @entity12			1
at least 23 hostages and 32 " terrorists " were killed around the sprawling facility in eastern @entity2 's desert , the @entity2 interior ministry said saturday			1
some 685 @entity2 workers and 107 foreigners have been freed , it said			1
it is not clear just how many people are still unaccounted for			1
a senior @entity24 official said two @entity24 were among that number			1
the saga closed after a " final " assault , which itself contributed to the deaths of seven hostages and 11 militants , according to @entity2 state media reports			1
an @entity33 report did not specify the nationalities of those killed			0
@entity0 is unable to verify the state media figures on the deaths			0
afterward , @entity2 's military continued to clear mines planted by militants , the official @entity2 press service reported , citing the country 's state - owned oil and gas company			1
" while the site is still dangerous and there may be explosives that will need to be dealt with , the terrorist incident is now over , " said @entity45 prime minister @entity44 , citing his conversation with his @entity2 counterpart			1
the militant siege caught the world 's attention as it ensnared citizens from several nations and dragged on for days			0
@entity2 authorities said they believe the attack was revenge for allowing @entity60 to use @entity2 airspace for an offensive against @entity64 militants in neighboring @entity65			1
whatever the rationale , the scale and gore of the terror has stirred world leaders to press for action beyond @entity2 , especially with @entity73 extremists asserting themselves more and more in recent weeks			2
" let me be clear : there is no justification for taking innocent life in this way , " @entity44 said			0
" our determination is stronger than ever to work with allies ... around the world to root out and defeat this terrorist scourge and those who encourage it			0
" @entity45 foreign secretary @entity86 said @entity2 authorities " certainly worked very hard to try to save the lives of people from other @entity89 i think it 's actually too early to pass judgment on ( the @entity2 military operation )			1
" @entity24 president @entity93 said his administration would work with other countries to " combat the scourge of terrorism in the region , which has claimed too many innocent lives			1
this attack is another reminder of the threat posed by @entity103 and other violent extremist groups in @entity12			0
" in a statement , @entity93 said the @entity24 will work with @entity2 to prevent future such incidents			1
crisis highlights pressure , potential on @entity2 @entity2 special forces moved in because the terrorists wanted to flee for @entity65 -- apparently to pressure @entity60 and others who have recently intervened in that country -- @entity2 state tv reported saturday			1
the @entity73 extremists also planned to blow up the gas installation , a threat that initially prompted @entity2 to halt its military operation			1
the location was rigged to explode , with mines planted throughout , according to the senior @entity24 official			1
@entity2 's status as @entity12 's largest natural gas producer , and as a major supplier of the product to @entity125 , heightens its importance to other nations and businesses who want to invest there			1
yet that interest is coupled with pressure to make sure foreign nationals , and their business ventures , are safe			0
the targeted plant in @entity135 , which is just 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) west of the @entity137 border , is run by @entity2 's state oil company , in cooperation with foreign firms such as @entity142 's @entity141 and @entity45 's @entity143			1
saturday 's last push there follows another one two days earlier , which spurred criticism from some countries that @entity2 had unnecessarily endangered hostages ' lives			1
@entity45 defense secretary @entity150 said @entity45 was still pressing the @entity2 government for full details , while confirming the saturday assault resulted in more deaths			2
he called the loss of life " appalling and unacceptable , " laying blame solely on the terrorists			0
like @entity44 , @entity142 foreign ministry spokesman @entity159 confirmed that the @entity2 military offensive was over , but did not offer further details			2
nations scramble to account for missing the overall death toll could rise , @entity2 state tv reports , as authorities are still combing the area			1
amid the uncertainty , individual nations are scrambling to find out what happened to their citizens			0
it is not clear how many hostages were seized by the @entity64 militants in the first place			2
five @entity142 are missing while " eight are now safe , " @entity142 prime minister @entity176 said			0
five @entity45 nationals and one @entity45 resident are missing or feared dead in @entity2 , @entity86 told reporters			2
this is in addition to one @entity183 , whose death was previously announced			0
@entity186 's president said a citizen was presumed dead			0
the @entity189 government said eight of its residents are safe			0
there are no known @entity60 hostages unaccounted for , a defense minister @entity192 said saturday			2
three @entity60 nationals who were at the site are safe , the foreign ministry has said			0
one man -- identified as @entity199 -- died after telling the @entity60 newspaper @entity200 on thursday that he and 34 other hostages of nine different nationalities were well - treated			2
of the @entity143 employees , 14 are safe , and four @entity143 employees are still missing in @entity2 , @entity143 chief executive @entity203 said			2
at least one @entity24 , identified as @entity208 , is among the dead , @entity207 spokeswoman @entity206 said			2
the senior @entity24 official told @entity0 that six freed @entity24 left @entity2 and one remained			1
one @entity213 lost his life , a spokeswoman for the @entity213 @entity212 told @entity0 on saturday			0
four other @entity213 were freed			0
and there are 14 @entity217 unaccounted for , chief cabinet secretary @entity215 said			0
@entity219 's state - run news agency reported thursday that two of its citizens were held captive			2
dramatic tales of escape from terror when the crisis began wednesday , militants gathered the @entity7 into a group and tied them up , survivors said			0
the kidnappers wielded @entity231 rifles and put explosive - laden vests on some hostages , according to a @entity207 official			2
some survivors described their harrowing escapes by rigging up disguises , sneaking to safety with locals , and in at least one case , running for his life with plastic explosives strapped around his neck			0
that man was @entity247 , who -- according to his brother @entity248 -- was among a group of hostages who had been blindfolded , gagged and then packed into five jeeps on thursday , during @entity2 forces ' first offensive			1
an explosion " wiped out " four of the vehicles , while @entity247 's vehicle crashed			0
he was able to get out and , eventually , contact his family			0
" i have n't seen my mother move as fast in all my life , and my mother smile as much , hugging each other , " @entity258 of @entity259 , @entity260 , said upon his family hearing his brother was safe			0
" ... you could n't describe the feeling			0
" @entity103 - linked group offered prisoner - hostage exchange a spokesman for @entity271 , a longtime jihadist who leads the @entity272 -- a militant group associated with @entity273 -- reportedly offered to free @entity24 hostages in exchange for two prisoners			1
behind the group claiming responsibility for the attack and kidnappings , he is known for seizing hostages and has long been targeted by @entity60 counterterrorism forces			2
the prisoners are @entity285 , who orchestrated the 1993 @entity287 bombing , and @entity288 , a @entity289 woman jailed in the @entity24 on terrorism charges , the spokesman said in an interview with a private @entity293 news agency			1
@entity206 rejected the offer , restating @entity24 policy of not negotiating with terrorists			0
