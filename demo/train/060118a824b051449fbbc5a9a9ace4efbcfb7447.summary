-- as a baseball executive whose mother survived relentless domestic violence , and an advocate who worked for years to pass the @entity7 , we want to celebrate the 20th anniversary of that life - saving bill , signed into law on september 13 , 1994			1
this groundbreaking law was the first to put the full force of the federal government into efforts to stop violence against women and help victims			2
it reshaped our criminal justice system , ushered in training for law enforcement and judges , and enhanced a life - saving national network of services and supports that has saved countless lives			2
over time , the law became a catalyst for broader , badly needed change			2
in fact , according to the @entity30 , intimate partner violence has dropped 64 % since the @entity7 was passed 20 years ago			1
now that 's something we can all be proud of			2
but frankly , the media paid little attention to the bill that was introduced by then - senator @entity37 , and signed into law by president @entity39 in 1994			2
they were too busy clamoring over the story about a high - profile @entity43 football hero named @entity44			0
@entity44 had a history of domestic violence and was on trial for the murder of his wife and friend			1
he was acquitted in that famous trial			0
but the @entity44 story had a silver lining : it led to tens of thousands of women around the country feeling empowered to reveal their own stories of abuse			0
and it gave activists an opportunity to rally their communities and demand more services and protections for victims and survivors			0
it took the topic of domestic violence from the back page to the front page and to the top of the newscast -- everywhere			1
it 's ironic , then , that 20 years later , the nation would be so laser - focused on the story of another football hero			1
in this case , it 's the story of @entity83 player @entity82 that is dominating our conversations , and despite the damage done , there is a positive repercussion worth noting : again , thousands of people are sharing personal statements and encouragements around the issue of domestic violence			1
@entity43 toughens domestic violence policy with six - game bans there 's even a hashtag campaign , # whyistayed			1
we know from experience , that staying in the public conversation is often the precursor to making true and lasting change			0
and we 're hopeful that the @entity43 , and other professional sports leagues are recognizing that now is the time for a strong , enforceable policies that will not tolerate domestic violence or sexual assault			1
the first @entity7 did n't do nearly enough for the children who grow up in homes in which there is violence			1
it did n't do enough to help college students and other victims of rape , stalking and sexual assault			0
it did n't do enough for minority , immigrant and disabled communities , and populations with special needs			0
and it did n't do enough to promote prevention			0
@entity43 's past penalties for domestic violence ' a different story ' with each subsequent re-authorization of the law , progress has been made -- but there 's much more to do			1
we 're convinced the country can finish the job			2
vice president @entity37 poured his heart and soul into passing the @entity7 20 years ago and his commitment has never wavered			1
he was its proudest champion , winning crucial support on both sides of the political aisle			0
we still need him , and we still need a bipartisan group of dedicated congressional champions			0
today , we both work with key federal agencies , large philanthropies , leading corporations and other partners that share our mission to finish what the @entity7 started			1
we need every one of them			0
there 's still much too much violence against women , and our nation pays a huge price			2
we need to continue the progress for adult women , heal kids who are hurt , and show perpetrators that they have to be accountable for their actions			0
we need to engage the public and make men part of the solution			0
passage of the @entity7 was a triumph of bipartisanship , and a moment in time when lawmakers had the clarity and courage to recognize that they could make an enormous difference on a problem affecting every community			1
it was a huge step forward for the country			0
twenty years later , we should cherish and take enormous pride in this achievement -- and finish the job			1
join us on @entity182 / @entity181 .			0

it 's been 20 years since the @entity7 was passed
