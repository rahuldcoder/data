however , after having time to review the race later that night , @entity1 was keen to stress that his criticism in the heat of the moment had been unfair on his former @entity20 teammate			1
@entity2 himself had earlier offered an apology for his part in the incident , although he believed @entity1 was allowing him to overtake			2
" it was really tough to get through the pack safely and i had a bit of a collision with @entity1 , " @entity2 said on the podium			2

" @entity2 is now 14 points behind @entity55 at the top of the drivers ' standings after the @entity4 won his home race			2
