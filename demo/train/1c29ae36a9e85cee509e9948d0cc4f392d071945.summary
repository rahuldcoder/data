-- the taxi rocked to the pounding sounds of @entity4 rap music			1
my wife turned to our hostess			0
" can you ask him to turn it down ? " the hostess waved her hands nervously			0
" no , it will only offend him			0
" she explained : the massive @entity18 taxi shortage had transformed the city 's cab drivers into so many motorized @entity21 : " my cab , my music ; if you do n't like it -- walk			1
" back in 1937 , @entity18 capped the number of taxi permits at 14,000			1
now , 75 years later , a bigger and vastly richer @entity18 receives some 27 million tourist visits per year -- and the number of cabs has edged up less than 14 % , to 15,900			1
result : in wind and rain and baking sun , @entity30 must stand in long lines at taxi stands for cabs that never come			0
in 2007 , the new government of @entity38 proposed to supplement the existing fleet			0
it would license 6,500 new cars in @entity18 , 23,500 in the rest of @entity4			1
the proposal triggered a strike that shut down the city for a day -- and frightened @entity38 into surrender			0
five years later , it 's as difficult to find a cab in @entity18 as ever			1
( @entity18 has about 2,000 more cab licenses than @entity51 , which has a much bigger population , but @entity51 has a vast fleet of cars for hire to supplement medallion cabs -- and except for the luxury market , car services are illegal in @entity18			1
) on the list of world problems , the difficulties of @entity18 taxi riders may seem to rank low			1
almost 3 million @entity4 people are now out of work , the severest unemployment in 12 years			2
millions more have quit the workforce altogether , subsisting on disability pensions or other social benefits			0
prolonged mass unemployment in @entity70 has triggered a global debate about the euro currency , and rightly so			2
yet it 's also true that every day , people in @entity70 are denied work by dumb laws that prevent willing customers from hiring them			1
adding 30,000 new taxi licenses in @entity4 would mean more than 90,000 daily taxi shifts : in other words , upwards of 90,000 new jobs			1
and it 's not just taxis			2
@entity4 's @entity85 law strictly regulates the creation of new retail premises			1
anyone who wishes to create a new store in @entity4 of more than 300 square meters must first gain permission from a government commission that includes -- wait for it ! -- other existing retailers			2
in @entity94 likewise , the federal government until recently forbade stores to stay open past 10 p.m. ( in 2011 , the federal government transferred authority over hours to the states , some of which have chosen to allow longer openings			0
) in almost every @entity70 country , restrictions on firing workers have made employers very reluctant about hiring in the first place			1
that hesitation -- plus heavy payroll taxes that raise hiring costs -- explain why so many @entity70 restaurants , cafes , and shops seem so lightly staffed compared to their @entity114 counterparts			1
these are not macroeconomic issues			0
they do n't involve central banks or currency policy			0
these are anti-competitive rules that prevent hiring that employers would want to do even in bad economic times			1
fixing these rules requires some political courage , which is never in super-abundant supply			0
but courage is not the only thing needed			0
imagination and ingenuity are even more important			0
go back to our @entity18 taxi drivers			1
why are they so opposed to adding to the taxi fleet ? interestingly , they 're not concerned about competition for fares : they know as well as anybody that the cab shortage is leaving money quite literally standing on the sidewalk			2
what concerns them , rather , is the value of their licenses			0
@entity18 drivers have paid nearly 200,000 euros for their licenses -- money they have usually borrowed and must work frantically to repay			2
drivers regard their licenses as precious capital assets , which they hope to resell in turn			0
if the fleet increases , the value of those licenses would presumably drop			0
@entity38 's 2007 reform proposals called for giving away the 30,000 additional licenses for free			2
it said nothing about compensating the existing licensees			0
if drivers had been reassured on that point , they might have been mollified -- and if they still protested , overriding such protests would have been easier			0
@entity4 's new president , @entity164 , has yet to take a stance on this			1
it 's not enough for @entity70 's would - be reformers to summon their courage			1
they must also be shrewd -- and that 's no easy task in a crisis terrifying enough to cause almost anyone to lose his or her head			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity18 is suffering from a world - *famous* taxi shortage , says @entity177
despite attempts at reform , the number of taxis has increased only 14 % since 1937 , he says
@entity70 's economic crisis is embodied in @entity4 's *failure* to fix this problem , @entity177 says
@entity192 : @entity70 's anti-competitive rules that prevent hiring are an economic *burden*
