@entity0 -- weeks ago , @entity2 was behind the wheel of a new prototype car for the @entity6 racing series -- one meant to make his sport safer , albeit ideally no less exciting			1
the two - time @entity10 winner , who 'd been one of a handful of key collaborators in the safety effort as identified on the racing circuit 's website , never got a chance to see the refined engines at work in a real race			1
instead on monday , his friends , colleagues and the racing world were mourning his death following a fiery 15 - car wreck at the @entity25			1
" i lost one of my best friends , one of my greatest teammates , " driver @entity26 told reporters hours after sunday 's fatal crash			1
" i know this is a dangerous sport			0
i know we 're exposed to that every day , in normal life as well , " he added			0
" but you know , you do n't think about it			0
today , we have to think about it			0
" images from the fatal crash had he won sunday 's race , the @entity42 with the ready smile and engaging manner would have earned a $ 5 million payout			2
instead , he was near the back of the 34 - car field when he got mixed up in a crash that featured numerous cars spinning out of control and bursting into flames , spewing smoke and debris			2
" all i could see was fire and parts flying and smoke , " recalled @entity55 , one of those involved in the crash , on monday			0
" when it all came to a stop , it looked like something out of a movie set ... it did n't seem real			0
" an official at the @entity67 , who was not named per the office 's policy , told @entity1 on monday that @entity2 officially died from " blunt head trauma			1
" the 33 - year - old 's death has been ruled an " accident			1
" two other drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- @entity77 and @entity78 -- were released monday from @entity79 in @entity0 , @entity6 said in a release			1
@entity78 had surgery sunday night for a burn injury to a finger on her right hand , while @entity77 was held overnight after suffering a severely bruised sternum			0
championship contender @entity87 was treated and released sunday , @entity6 spokeswoman @entity86 said			1
the violent crash raised fresh questions about safety , both in motor sports generally and at the @entity0 track specifically			1
@entity2 had been a driving force to address such concerns			2
in an early october story posted on @entity98 , the racing series ' official website , @entity6 vice president @entity96 singled out the 33 - year - old driver , his team and @entity104 manufacturer @entity103 for their efforts to fine - tool a safer car model for the 2012 season			1
" he 's focused on what 's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to @entity103 and be consistent and concise , " @entity96 said then of @entity2			2
" you could n't have asked for more			0
" @entity2 was known as " a great family man " ironically , the new 2012 cars were expected to have components -- namely extra protection around tires -- to prevent spin - outs like the one that triggered sunday 's wreck when two vehicles ' bump together , said @entity55			1
" they want the cars to run a bit more in a pack , ( but ) these cars are not designed to bang wheels with each other at 225 mph , " the veteran driver said			1
" our wheels ( currently ) are exposed			0
once you have two cars touch each other , you do n't have any control			0
" @entity2 's death was the first for the @entity6 circuit since march 2006 , when driver @entity139 was killed in a two - car crash while warming up for the season - opening race at @entity142			1
it is one of several in motor sports generally , one of the most famous being the elder @entity147 's death in @entity149 's @entity148			0
@entity151 senior writer @entity150 said monday that the sheer speed of race cars , and the minimal distance separating them , means danger lurks around every turn and on every straightaway			0
@entity2 , for example , was bunched with several other vehicles cruising at about 220 miles an hour when sunday 's crash occurred			1
" the fact of the matter is , you 're dealing with very , very fast automobiles			0
they 're not heavy cars , " @entity150 said			0
" there is , unfortunately , an assumption of risk when you get into one of those race cars			0
" beyond questions about racing 's safety generally , the condition of the @entity178 -- and whether or not it was too fast and too crammed with vehicles -- was the subject of intense questioning in the hours after @entity2 's death			1
driver @entity184 told @entity185 that the track offered " nowhere to get away from anybody			1
" " this is not a suitable track , and we 've seen it today , " he said			1
the loop in @entity0 is 1.5 miles , one mile shorter than that of the iconic @entity193			2
at the same time , it is wider than many others -- such that more cars can run alongside , and potentially collide with , one another			2
in an interview with @entity1 on monday , former @entity6 driver @entity198 noted too that the slope of the track 's curves and its straightaway can create " this momentum and this ability for all the cars to be able to go flat out , ( which ) really takes the car out of the driver 's hands			1
" not going as far as @entity184 in critiquing the @entity0 oval , @entity211 said that a number of factors -- including the vehicles ' speed and numbers , as well as the track 's configuration -- came together " like the perfect storm			1
" " it was unfortunate , it was tragic , it was something we all wish would never have happened , " she said of @entity2 's death			1
blog : @entity2 's death should bring changes in racetracks that sentiment rang true for many in the racing community			1
after the crash at the @entity238 , many of the remaining drivers were emotional during and after a five - lap salute in @entity2 's honor			1
the rest of the marquee event was canceled			0
" there are no words for today , " driver @entity243 , the first woman to win an @entity6 race in 2008 , tweeted			1
" myself and so many others are devastated			0
i pray for suzi ( @entity2 's wife ) and the kids that god will give them strength			2
" @entity2 , who was born in @entity253 , @entity42 , lived in @entity254 , @entity255			2
his father was a go - kart racer , and his mother was the timer at a local track			2
as a driver , @entity2 teamed up with the @entity262 to promote awareness of alzheimer 's disease ; he was wearing the association 's logo when he won the @entity10 in may			1
his mother was diagnosed with the disease in 2009			0
in @entity269 , @entity268 told @entity1 affiliate @entity270 that his son - in - law -- who , just hours before this weekend 's race , had sung him " @entity274 " over the phone -- was n't " just a great driver , but he was a great human being , " @entity268 said			2
" he was always positive , always had something good to say about everybody			0
" he said @entity2 and his daughter had been married four years and have two sons , ages 2 1/2 years and 7 months			1
in a statement released monday , @entity2 's management company , @entity283 , described the driver as a " champion on the track and a devoted family man off it			1
" " @entity2 loved his fans and always took that extra bit of time to take a photo , to sign an autograph , to make some young kid smile at the racetrack			1
everyone wanted to be around @entity2			2
his passion and his enthusiasm for life was infectious			0
" @entity211 remembered @entity2 as a " brash kid from @entity42 " when he first began			2
" we watched him mature into being this absolute , consummate professional , " she said			0
" ... he touched so many people			0
" she said she believes @entity2 's death will " kind of raise the bar " in terms of safety for drivers			1
while a number of safety measures are in place , and the sport will always be high - risk , " we do n't want this kind of thing to happen , " she said			0
@entity55 concurred , telling @entity1 's @entity319 that he hopes " out of this tragedy , comes some good in terms of improving safety , " like putting see - through glass in place of web - like netting around tracks			0
the driver added that his wife and parents have implored him to retire in the wake of his friend 's death			2
while he said he is considering it , @entity55 also acknowledged that he and other racers are n't blind to the dangers			0
" we 're all thrill - seekers at heart , we all take risks on the race track , " he said			2
" this sport is n't for everybody			0
( nonetheless ) , obviously , we 'd like to see improvement			0
" @entity1 's @entity342 and @entity343 contributed to this report .			0
