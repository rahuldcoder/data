@entity0 -- all in - bound cargo on commercial flights from @entity4 , the @entity5 and @entity6 -- and quite possibly other areas of the world -- is being screened twice , as a result of the recent terror threats that have closed @entity12 embassies and consulates in the @entity5 and @entity6 , according to a cargo industry official			1
the @entity15 late last week ordered airlines to increase the inspection of cargo at the last point of departure for the @entity12 , said @entity20 , the executive director of @entity21 , a trade group			1
" they said , ' until further notice , this is what you 're going to do , ' " @entity20 said			2
" nothing unscreened gets on the plane , " @entity20 said			0
" basically they said , ' if you used one method , or several methods ( of inspecting cargo ) , you need to do it again			2
' it 's redundant , dual screening			1
" @entity36 expanding program to speed security lines " so now the freight is doubly secure , " he said			0
the @entity12 beefed up screening after discovering two toner cartridges packed with plastic explosives on board two aircraft bound for the @entity12 in october 2010			1
@entity46 took responsibility for the plot			0
@entity46 is involved in the communications leading to the most recent warnings that have closed @entity12 facilities , @entity12 officials say			1
@entity15 officials have declined to say what , if any , security measures have been taken as the result of the recent worldwide terror alert			0
travelers must ' say something ' in a statement released to the media , a @entity15 official said : " as always , our security posture , which at all times includes a number of measures both seen and unseen , will continue to respond appropriately to protect the @entity12 people from an ever evolving threat picture			1
" privately , officials say that even in the absence of specific intelligence , it is prudent to increase security in the @entity12 , especially given @entity46 's past deeds			1
@entity20 said the increased screening has resulted in some backlogs and delays , especially as some airlines have sought to clarify the rules			2
" we 're in august , so it 's not the busiest time of year , " he said			0
