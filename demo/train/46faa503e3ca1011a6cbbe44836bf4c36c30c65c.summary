-- president @entity2 's surprise visit to @entity3 on tuesday included an extraordinary admission : " our goal is not to build a country in @entity9 's image , or to eradicate every vestige of the @entity11			1
these objectives would require many more years , many more dollars and many more @entity9 lives			2
" @entity2 pledged to continue @entity9 support for a sovereign , peaceful state in @entity3			1
he also committed to withdraw all @entity9 combat soldiers by 2014 and diminish direct @entity9 efforts at nation - building			2
the president declared that the defeat of @entity22 was " within reach , " but he did not promise any specific political outcomes in the country where @entity9 have fought for more than 10 years			2
the speech and the strategic partnership agreement that the president signed begin the rapid withdrawal of @entity9 forces from the region			1
the @entity32 has given little public attention to @entity3 in the last two years , and it has continually lowered expectations			2
a recent upsurge in violence , homicidal acts allegedly by an @entity9 soldier and the offensive burning of @entity38 in @entity3 have turned whatever hope some might have had for the future of the region into despondence			1
the @entity2 administration has clearly determined that it can not succeed in bringing security and stability to @entity3			1
the @entity9 will leave as quickly as it can , providing vague and limited assurances of support for @entity51 's government and new national institutions			1
this is not a victory or a vindication for @entity9 efforts			2
it is not an admission of defeat either			0
@entity2 is indeed correct that @entity22 's capabilities in @entity3 are largely diminished , thanks in part to vastly expanded @entity9 drone strikes in the last three years			1
the president is also accurate when he explains that some @entity3 institutions , especially the @entity65 , are more effective than they were before 2009			2
direct @entity9 talks with members of the @entity11 have shown , according to the president , that some former supporters of that horrible regime now see a future for themselves in the new @entity73 government			1
these are all conditions that make @entity3 far less threatening to its neighbors and the @entity9 than it had been a decade earlier			1
@entity76 has accomplished that limited goal			0
protecting this modest accomplishment while withdrawing @entity9 forces will drive policy in the next few months			0
@entity2 's speech signals that he wants to assert that he has done enough and now must focus on other strategic priorities , including the weak @entity9 economy			1
he will continue to try and keep @entity3 out of the news , and he will quickly seek to reallocate precious financial and military resources from the region to other locations , especially @entity88 and the @entity89			0
the @entity32 is rebalancing away from @entity90			0
the promising opportunities for the @entity9 are in the @entity93 world ( now dominated by the @entity94 ) , not @entity3			1
this strategy will work to keep the @entity9 safe from another major terrorist attack planned and executed on @entity3 territory			1
@entity9 efforts will not , however , bring peace and stability to the region			0
@entity51 will remain the president of @entity3 , running a corrupt and incompetent government			1
local warlords will continue to dominate politics outside @entity106 , siphoning capital from productive uses to their personal enrichment			0
the @entity11 will maintain its low - level insurgency , with support and shelter from @entity113			0
in all of these ways , and others , @entity3 will remain a failed state			2
soon it will become a failed and ignored state , as it was in the years before september 11 , 2001			0
a failed @entity3 state that does not threaten the @entity9 marks neither a victory nor a defeat for the @entity2 administration			1
the president correctly avoided the use of either word			0
as with other issues , @entity2 has found a pragmatic middle ground that protects core strategic needs , reduces risks and appeals to war - weary voters			1
he has placed safety for @entity9 above other worthy goals : democracy , human rights and development			0
@entity3 will continue to suffer from violence , disunity , corruption and governmental collapse			0
these sources of instability will spread to other countries , especially neighboring @entity113 , and they will undermine long - term @entity9 interests			2
for the next year or so , however , the @entity9 can withdraw and solidify some security gains			0
that is enough for @entity2			0
it might not look like nearly enough a few years on			0
a strategic retreat in @entity3 makes sense , but @entity3 and @entity9 will pay a price			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0

@entity152 : @entity2 's speech represents start of rapid withdrawal from @entity3 war
@entity159 says the strategic retreat makes sense in the short run
@entity159 says it leaves @entity3 as a state with a corrupt government , @entity11 threat
in the long term , the risks for the @entity9 and @entity3 could increase , he says
