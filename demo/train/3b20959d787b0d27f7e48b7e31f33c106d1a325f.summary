@entity0 -- a federal judge has ordered that an official monitor be put in place to prevent discrimination in the hiring of @entity0 firefighters			1
@entity9 district judge @entity8 said the city needs " to comprehensively reassess its policies and practices , to analyze the evidence showing the effect of those policies and practices , and to rationally consider how they can be changed to achieve a firefighter hiring process that is -- in actual practice and effect -- fair and open to all			1
" the order requires the city to take remedial steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and puts the court monitor in place for at least the next 10 years to make sure those steps are taken			1
@entity8 cited " the clear evidence of disparate impact that @entity32 ( @entity31 ) @entity30 and his senior leadership chose to ignore was obvious to anyone else who looked			1
" " instead of facing hard facts and asking hard questions about the @entity41 's abysmal track record of hiring black and @entity43 firefighters , the @entity37 dug in and fought back , " the judge said in his ruling			2
@entity44 , a spokesman for the mayor , said the city intends to appeal the decision			0
litigation against the city 's firefighter hiring practices began in 2007 , when the @entity9 @entity52 filed a complaint alleging the @entity54 of @entity0 's hiring exams negatively affected black and @entity43 applicants			2
" four years of litigation and two adverse liability rulings later , the @entity41 still does n't get it , " @entity8 said			2
" @entity41 's senior leaders have routinely denied that they are responsible or doing anything to remedy nearly forty years of discrimination			0
" @entity30 strongly disagreed with the decision			0
" i think it 's fair to say no previous administration has done more or been as successful in attracting the diversity to the @entity68 than we have , " the mayor told reporters wednesday , " and i could n't feel more strongly about it			2
" @entity30 said 61,000 people , more than half of them minorities , applied to the fire department in the last recruiting campaign , " shattering any previous record for minority applicants			1
" @entity8 acknowledged that the city has improved its minority recruiting , but he said the subsequent hiring processes and " discriminatory testing procedures " have kept many of these minorities from actually being hired			1
@entity81 , a representative of the @entity82 , one of the plaintiffs in the case , praised the decision			0
" we 're very pleased to see this order and it 's certainly long overdue , " @entity81 said			0
" we 're glad to see the judge properly addressing this issue			0
" details of the court - appointed monitoring , as well as logistics for a future fairness hearing in which third parties will be able to express their opinions , is scheduled for october 20 , said @entity99 , an attorney for the plaintiffs .			0
