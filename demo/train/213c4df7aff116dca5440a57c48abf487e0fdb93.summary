@entity0 , @entity1 -- for 21 years , @entity3 watched his ill father slip in and out of consciousness , traveling to hospitals that were n't equipped to help him			1
@entity8 was injured in a 1981 car accident near @entity0 , @entity1 's capital			1
he suffered only a broken arm at first , but an infection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life			0
" there were no neurosurgeons in @entity1 , " @entity3 said			1
" we would have taken him out of @entity1 if we had the money			1
" instead , @entity3 spent years escorting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals , getting whatever treatment they could get			1
" it 's not easy , " @entity3 said			1
" you can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first			0
there ( are ) a lot of patients			2
... some people can die because they are waiting			2
" the situation has n't changed much since @entity3 's father passed away in 2002			1
in @entity1 , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the @entity37			1
for comparison 's sake , the ratio in the @entity39 is one doctor for every 413 people			2
and even if they could see a physician , many @entity1 could n't afford it			1
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three - quarters of the country 's health - care spending is private			1
" the only problem they have is poverty , " @entity3 said			1
" and with poverty , they ... can not enjoy their life			0
" seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffer , @entity3 was determined to do something about it			1
he became a doctor himself , working as a vascular surgeon in @entity0 's @entity61			0
and he started a nonprofit , @entity62 , that travels into rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care			1
since 2008 , he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people			2
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people jam into vans , tie medical supplies to the roofs and travel across rough terrain to visit villages in need			1
their luck does n't always hold out : they 've had to push vehicles through rivers and mud more than once			0
but when they arrive , they receive a true heroes ' welcome : a feast , singing and dancing , and the best accommodations the community can offer			0
in these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebration , and @entity94 -- with his big smile and boundless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun			1
the next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients			1
" we are receiving 500 people in each trip , " @entity3 said			1
" they are coming from 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) around the village , and they 're coming on foot			0
" each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical care			1
many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases			0
others might receive crutches , a pair of donated eyeglasses or free birth certificates -- documentation that 's required for school but that many impoverished families simply ca n't afford			2
in the evenings , the team will do simple surgeries with local anesthesia			0
operations are usually done in a schoolhouse , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person			0
with the group 's generator lighting the operating room and sanitizing equipment , @entity3 and his volunteers work into the early hours of sunday morning			2
it 's a backbreaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated			0
" they are beating drums all the night to ( keep us ) awake and continue our work , " @entity3 said			2
on sunday , the team heads back to the city , tired but proud of their work			0
the group -- a mix of @entity1 doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help			1
one man explained that the free hernia surgery he 'd received will allow him to work again			0
" this will change my future with my family , " the man said			0
in addition to holding these weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon , @entity3 also works nights at private medical clinics around @entity0			1
it 's this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his nonprofit ; the rest is covered by private donations			0
" i 'm not sure when he sleeps , " said @entity179 , a second - year medical student from @entity180 in @entity181 and volunteer with @entity3 's group			2
" he is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns			0
" for medical and nursing students such as @entity179 , who come from the @entity39 and @entity191 to join @entity3 on his missions , it 's a hands - on opportunity they 'd never get at home			2
" we 've been able to scrub in on surgeries where we help blot blood away or hold tools for dr. @entity3 , " @entity179 said			1
" that 's not something you 'd ever get to do in @entity39 as a second - year medical student			0
" the student volunteers usually pay their own way to @entity1 , often arriving with donated medical supplies			2
but once they arrive in @entity0 , their board , transportation and instruction are covered by @entity94			0
" he 's a hero , without a doubt , " @entity179 said			0
" he gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the @entity1 people is everlasting			1
" for @entity3 , the near - constant workload is n't a hardship			1
helping others live happier lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy			0
" i am so happy when i am doing this work , " @entity3 said			2
" and i think about my father			0
i hope he sees what i am doing			0
" to make people laugh , to reduce the pain , that 's why i 'm doing this			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity62 website and see how to help .			0
