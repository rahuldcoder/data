-- @entity1 ended @entity4 's 43 - match unbeaten run on friday to set up another @entity6 final showdown with longtime tennis rival @entity7			1
second seed @entity4 had been seeking to equal @entity10 's 1984 record of 42 successive wins at the start of a season , but was denied his first final appearance at @entity6 by the 16 - time grand slam champion			1
@entity1 , the 2009 winner in @entity16 , triumphed 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 6 - 3 3 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) in three hours and 39 minutes in one of the all - time classic matches to prevent @entity4 taking top spot in the world rankings from @entity7			1
the @entity22 , seeking to clinch a record sixth @entity6 title , booked his place in sunday 's final with a 6 - 4 7 - 5 6 - 4 win over @entity27 fourth seed @entity25 in the opening semi			1
can @entity1 stop @entity7 equaling @entity30 's record ? " i had nerves and this was n't even the final , " @entity1 , who has never lost a grand slam match after leading by two sets , told reporters			1
" i have worked a lot in my life and it 's for these types of matches			2
it was certainly one of my greatest matches in an extraordinary atmosphere			0
" it was probably the best match i have played this year			0
there were breaks , break backs			0
it 's always intense when we play and i wanted to make it as physical as i could			0
" @entity4 had been unstoppable this year , winning seven titles as he beat @entity1 in his first three events of 2011			1
but the @entity55 third seed has battled through a disappointing year so far by his high standards to give himself a chance of extending his record tally of grand slams			2
the 29 - year - old won the first set in 70 minutes and the second in just 45 before his @entity64 opponent dug deep to reduce the deficit			1
the fourth set continued the extraordinarily high level of tennis on show , as @entity4 broke to lead 5 - 4 before @entity1 immediately returned the favor to level			1
a cheeky drop shot gave him the opening point of the tie - break , and @entity4 saved two match - points -- the second with an ace -- to give himself hope at 6 - 5			2
but , with darkness growing at the local time of 9.35 p.m. , @entity1 showed immaculate poise to blast one of his own down the middle to set up his 25th career meeting with @entity7			1
" all credit to him			0
he went for his shots , but there are no regrets for me , " @entity4 said after his first match since last sunday , following the withdrawal of his quarterfinal opponent @entity88			2
" he deserved to win			0
we were part of a very good match			0
but i had a great tournament			0
it 's been the best five months of my career and i knew it had to end some time			0
" the 24 - year - old subsequently revealed he would miss the start of the grass - court season as he pulled out of next week 's tournament at @entity104 's @entity103 in @entity105 due to knee problems , having played with support strapping throughout his @entity16 campaign			2
@entity7 leads @entity1 16 - 8 and has won all three of their @entity6 final encounters plus a semi in 2005			1
he earlier celebrated his 25th birthday as he extended his career record at @entity6 to 44 - 1 after beating @entity25 in three hours and 17 minutes			1
the @entity22 , beaten by @entity4 in clay finals at @entity115 and @entity116 , is now one match away from equaling @entity30 's record of six titles in @entity16			1
on sunday he will seek to become just the seventh player to win 10 grand slam titles			2
" i have a lot of respect for the great @entity30 , but i am focused on trying to play well , " the defending champion told the @entity124 website			1
" for me , is much more important [ to ] win @entity6 than equal @entity30			1
" @entity25 , who lost to @entity4 in january 's @entity128 title match , failed in his bid to become the first @entity27 male to reach the final since @entity132 in 1937			1
" i thought i did well			0
everyone seems to think it 's easy against @entity7 to just come into the net or come in or go for big shots , but you do have to be very patient , " he said after dropping to 4 - 11 against @entity7			2
" sometimes i did n't quite get the ball i was looking for , and sometimes when i did i made a few mistakes			0
but i think it was a close match			0
i do n't think there was too much in it			0
he just played better than me today			0
" going into the grass ( season ) i have to take positives from that , but i also need to look at things that i need to work on , not only for the grass - court season but beyond that as well			0
so i look forward to getting back on the practice court			0
