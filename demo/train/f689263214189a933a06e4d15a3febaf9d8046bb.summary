earthquake experts worldwide expressed shock at the manslaughter convictions of six @entity4 scientists who failed to predict the deadly @entity6 quake , warning that the decision could severely harm future research			1
two scientists resigned their posts with the government 's disaster preparedness agency tuesday after a court in @entity6 sentenced six scientists and a government official to six years in prison			1
the court ruled monday that the scientists failed to accurately communicate the risk of the 2009 quake , which killed more than 300 people			1
@entity22 , the physicist who led the @entity23 for the @entity24 , resigned in protest of the verdict tuesday afternoon , @entity4 's @entity21 announced			1
" the situation created by the sentencing yesterday on the facts from @entity6 is incompatible with a clear and effective performance of the functions of the commission and its role as a consulting bodies for the state , " @entity22 said in a statement released by the agency			1
in addition , @entity39 quit as director of the office that monitors volcano and earthquake threats , the agency said			1
@entity47 will be given another post , it said			0
seismologists were aghast at the court 's decision , noting that earthquakes remain impossible to forecast with any kind of accuracy			1
" to predict a large quake on the basis of a relatively commonplace sequence of small earthquakes and to advise the local population to flee " would constitute " both bad science and bad public policy , " said @entity62 , an associate professor in the @entity64 sciences faculty of the @entity65			0
" if scientists can be held personally and legally responsible for situations where predictions do n't pan out , then it will be very hard to find scientists to stick their necks out in the future , " @entity62 said in a statement			2
prosecutors argued that the scientists gave " inaccurate , incomplete and contradictory information about the dangers " facing @entity6 at a meeting a week before the magnitude - 6.3 quake			1
the experts determined that it was " unlikely " but not impossible that a major quake would take place , despite concern among the city 's residents over recent seismic activity			2
the court agreed , finding the six scientists from the @entity90 and a member of the @entity21 guilty and ordering @entity4 authorities to pay 7.8 million euros ( $ 10 million ) in damages			1
" it 's chilling that people can be jailed for giving a scientific opinion in the line of their work , " @entity94 , the head of seismic hazard and archives at the @entity98 , wrote in a comment published on the organization 's @entity101 feed			2
comments from one of the defendants -- @entity111 , former president of the @entity90 -- suggested that the scientists were shell - shocked by their conviction			0
" i 'm dejected , despairing			0
i still do n't understand what i 'm accused of , " @entity111 said after the ruling , according to @entity115 , @entity4 's official news agency			1
@entity111 and the six others convicted monday will remain free during the appeal process			0
the @entity4 geophysics institute expressed " regret and concern " about the verdict in a statement monday			2
it said the ruling " threatens to undermine one of the cornerstones of scientific research : that of freedom of investigation , of open and transparent discussion and sharing of results			0
" some experts have argued that the issue was a failure of communications , not calculations			0
@entity140 , who held @entity111 's old job at the institute for several months , said last year that the trial was about " the number of weak points in the communication chain			0
" " we all have to work on new , and more clear , protocols , on the transfer of information , " said @entity140 , who now conducts research in @entity148			0
survivors of the 2009 quake , some of whom who lost relatives or property in the disaster , have voiced anger at the officials who downplayed the risks despite the worries expressed by residents			2
" i can understand the grief of people who lost loved ones and the frustration that people feel when terrible events happen , especially ones outside their control , " @entity62 said			0
" convicting honest scientists of manslaughter does nothing to help this situation and may well put a chill on exactly the kind of science that could save lives in the future			0
" the ruling may well change the way experts disclose their opinions , according to @entity185 , a professor specializing in the public understanding of risk at @entity188 in @entity189			0
" @entity6 trial shows public scientists need to take media communication very seriously , " he wrote on his @entity101 account			1
