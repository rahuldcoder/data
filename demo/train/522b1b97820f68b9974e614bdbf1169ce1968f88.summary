-- faced with a choice between a cash incentive or signing up for a hard day 's work , which would you pick ? shoe retailer @entity6 is famous for bribing prospective employees to turn down a job offer , on the theory that we should only work in a place we love			1
this year , ceo @entity12 is testing whether this kind of corporate culture can work beyond the warehouse of this one quirky online company			1
@entity12 is trying to spark a delivering happiness movement , named after his recent book , which expands on how , and why , companies who care about their bottom line should make employees feel like a family			1
@entity12 made a name for himself at @entity6 by prioritizing customer service to an extreme , and his in - house employment policies have gotten at least as much attention			1
@entity6 , which is now part of the @entity31 family , has been climbing @entity34 's " @entity32 to work for " list , thanks to a corporate culture where " weird " is meant as a compliment and the line between personal and professional is often blurred			1
he tells @entity0 why workplace happiness is n't just for shoe retailers or dewy - eyed optimists			1
an edited version of the e-mail interview follows			0
@entity0 : when you got to what many people consider the top of the game in the corporate world , your outlook appears to have taken on a whole new set of goals			0
what became priorities for you in your career ? @entity12 : after @entity59 ( @entity12 's first company ) was sold , i could do whatever i wanted to from a financial point of view , which forced me to reflect and think about what i really wanted to get out of life			1
part of the goal of the book is to nudge people to really think about what they 're passionate about , what makes them happy			0
you do n't have to sell a company in order to think about what you want out of life			1
@entity77 ( @entity76 , @entity12 's partner and ceo of the @entity79 movement ) was actually in the same position at that time but for a completely different reason : she had just been laid off			1
through that process , she ended up pursuing things she was actually passionate about			0
3 rules for the first - time boss @entity0 : how does a little healthy cynicism fit into the delivering happiness equation ? ca n't a little bit of moaning and a critical attitude also have a place in the workplace ? @entity93 : there 's a difference between constructive criticism and complaining and moaning without helping contribute to a solution			1
you ca n't force employees to be like a family -- they actually need to want to do it themselves			2
our goal at @entity6 is to inspire -- not motivate -- employees to treat each other like family			2
for example , most @entity6 employees when they leave the office leave to hang out with other @entity6 employees			2
that 's behavior you ca n't force upon employees			2
they actually have to want to do it			0
@entity0 : you tweet and encourage employees to access social media on the job			2
the professional and the private are increasingly blurred			0
will social media also serve a business purpose , particularly as it extends to individual employees ? @entity93 : for us , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , blogs , etc. are all ways we can connect with our customers and employees			0
we 're not looking at them as marketing channels , more as connection channels , the same way we view the telephone as a great way to connect			0
at @entity6 we are all about blurring lines			0
our goal is to hire employees whose personal values match our 10 core values , so every employee is automatically living the brand , at home , in the office and in social media			1
rather than focus on work - life separation , we focus on work - life integration			1
@entity0 : prioritizing happy customers and happy employees seems like it should be a given , yet the @entity6 model still sticks out as a bit of a lone phenomenon			0
are most major companies not agile enough to play along with quirky ideas from a ceo ? @entity93 : i 'm not sure " happy customers " and " happy employees " should be classified as quirky , but in any case , i think the reason why we are n't seeing more companies in corporate @entity165 focus on these things ( yet ) is because the payoff from a financial perspective is usually two to three years down the road			0
many companies are focusing on the current quarter or current year at best			0
the good news is that information is moving faster and faster and companies are becoming more and more transparent whether they like it or not			0
as a result , the lag time between brand and culture is becoming less and less , so in the long run i think the " good guys " will win .			2

@entity12 : employees who really like their workplace are more likely to live for their jobs
delivering happiness movement targets work - life integration
a company 's brand is *fundamentally* connected to its employee culture , @entity12 says
