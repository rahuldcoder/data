-- a recent article in the @entity2 noted that the nation 's divorce rate -- which plateaued for years at around 50 % -- has significantly dropped -- to just above 40 %			1
as almost an aside , the writer mentioned that only one group , the 50 - plusers , have seen their rate of divorce surge 50 % in the past 20 years			1
oops -- to this boomer , that is " burying the lead			0
" why would only the boomers have a significant growth in marital dissolution -- one in four divorces after age 50 -- while other ages do not ? after all , it 's counterintuitive : traditionally marriages are most vulnerable to divorce in the first seven to 10 years			1
should we see this as a harbinger of doom for 30 - year - olds getting married today ? we might surmise from these data that the only reason the 20 - and 30 - somethings ' divorce rate is lower is that they just have n't lived as long			1
and , to be sure , some demographers do believe that eventually we can expect the marriages of @entity33 and millennials to meet the same fate as all of those divorcing boomers			2
however , i would like to float this idea : it wo n't necessarily happen that way			0
boomers ' unique social history may make them more divorce - prone than other groups			1
why ? baby boomers , those 79 million born roughly between 1945 and 1964 , are a specific cohort because of the conditions and events that they both experienced and , sometimes , created			1
boomers came of age as relatively pampered children of a great postwar economy			1
with their adolescent disrespect for the past and their theme of " sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll , " they pushed against the restrictive conventions of social life their parents more or less had accepted			0
they cut a swath through history partly because of their bulk -- 26 % of the @entity73 population -- and partly because of their critical approach to the status quo			1
as young adults , large numbers of them were part of the civil rights , anti-war , gay rights and women 's movements			2
books and magazine articles in their time attacked ( and counterattacked ) traditional gender roles -- and the institution of marriage and its traditions			2
boomer women experienced more recreational sex and more sex partners than women in previous generations			0
new job opportunities and careers helped create the changes in household formation ( such as who was or was n't home during the day , who did less or more housework , and who wanted more or less sex ) that disrupted traditional marriage			0
as a result , the boomers experienced decades of relationship innovation , creating cultural confusion about whether marriage was necessary , and what made an excellent -- or even adequate -- marriage			1
as boomer men and women wavered between choosing self - fulfillment over older traditions of duty , loyalty and lifetime marriage at any cost , the institution of marriage became , over time , more of a voluntary association than a predictably permanent one			1
sociologist and demographer @entity125 has written that between the 1960s and ' 70s the divorce rate skyrocketed , correlating exactly with the first divorces at the leading edge of the boomer generation			1
and while the rate leveled out in the 1980s , a large number of people had already defected toward new opportunities for emotional and sexual self - fulfillment			1
in many ways , divorce rates are the boomers ' legacy			2
but why does this group continue to make marital changes even in middle and late middle age ? because they are still making it up as they go along , inventing middle age pretty much the same way they made up adolescence and marriage , redefining the parameters of personal relationships and reinventing what different stages of the life cycle could look like			2
they are fighting fiercely to remain youthful , to stay employed and / or passionately engaged with life , sexually vibrant ( particularly with the help of new medical interventions ) and regard their 50s and 60s as every bit the opportunity for love and sexual attraction that their 20s and 30s were			0
at age 55 or 65 , they look at spending 20 or 30 more years with the same person -- and unlike their parents , whose sense of duty was stronger and opportunities to repair weaker , they are ready to walk if things are n't up to their hopes , dreams or delusions about marriage			2
so why do n't i think this same cycle will happen for our 30 - somethings ? they are more sober about marriage than boomers were at the same ages			2
they 've seen what high divorce rates felt like when their parents split up -- and many of them desperately want to avoid that kind of emotional carnage for their children or for themselves			0
indeed a @entity197 study on social and demographic trends found that " when it comes to divorce , the baby boomers are less conservative than younger generations : 66 % say divorce is preferable to staying in an unhappy marriage , compared with 54 % of younger adults who say so			1
" they are getting married later : the average age for college - educated men and women is in their late 20s			0
they are more mature , already gaining or losing traction in their chosen work or career , and potential partners can better gauge them as a marriage prospect			0
finally , they have been out of school longer , most of them have lived with someone one or more times , and they know more about the world and relationships			0
they have experienced a treacherous economy			0
their parents grew up in a lush financial period , but they did not			0
young couples are more like their grandparents or great grandparents : aware of the need to pull together for economic security			0
while not all boomers prospered during the hot economy that attended most of their adult years , they did n't start out being careful about the economic consequences of divorce in the way that their children -- and their own parents -- had to do			1
of course there is no telling if the divorce rate will continue to decline into the future			1
sadly , i would not predict that it will			0
we expect too much from marriage ; we have much too high expectations for what a partner should be throughout a long life cycle -- and we live a long time			0
it 's hard to keep a marriage strong , passionate and relevant over so many decades			0
but there is that 40 % divorce rate			1
maybe not exactly something to crow about , but better odds of having a marriage worth staying in is all to the good for the couple , our society and certainly the next generation			0
