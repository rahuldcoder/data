although i know my downward dog from my one - legged king pigeon pose , i 'm relatively new to yoga			1
yet even almost breaking my nose while attempting a handstand was n't enough to take away the enjoyment of attending a 10 - day yoga retreat in the @entity9 foothills			1
the @entity11 retreat in @entity12 , north @entity13 , is set in a wildlife reserve in the @entity15 and offers immersion into one of the most spiritual regions of @entity13			1
it 's home to a leopard , mongoose , snakes , scorpions , butterflies , birds and sole fish , to name a few resident creatures			1
@entity28 , co-owner of the retreat with his wife @entity30 , is the resident storyteller			2
in one of his many animal - themed @entity33 anecdotes , @entity28 explains how he once saw a sole fish jump out of a pond and snatch a spotted dove in flight			1
though yoga retreats are on offer year - round , one of the best times to go to @entity33 is october , when @entity41 is visiting			1
( this year , she 'll be at @entity33 october 3 - 12			2
) @entity42 is one of the world 's most acclaimed instructors of @entity46 yoga -- a practice that focuses on the heart and individual ability of each student			1
finding inner strength in the @entity15 the @entity11 day starts at 7 a.m. with a two - hour yoga session in the thatched shala facing the peaceful waters of the @entity15			1
at the entrance stands a striking brass statue of the @entity57 , a symbol of strength			2
practice begins gradually , with a talk by @entity42 about @entity57 gods and goddesses that resonate with yogic teachings and the benefits of yoga			2
a herd of cows quietly makes its way past , giving us curious glances as we twist and turn and try to maintain our balance			2
@entity42 says the need to stand tall and strong in yoga translates into everyday life : " it 's a reminder to stand tall in the face of fear			1
" she caters to all levels , encouraging partner work or individual practice			0
students on my retreat range from complete beginners to new or accomplished yoga teachers			1
although i come crashing down on the marble floor while attempting a handstand , by the next attempt , and with a lot of encouragement from @entity42 , i feel i could maintain the position for ages			0
well , at least two seconds and with the support of three people			0
what i come to realize is that these seemingly acrobatic poses require self belief and confidence ; the harder the pose , the more i have to silence my fears and gather resilience from within -- which makes me feel stronger on the whole			0
" i could tell you could do it , " @entity42 says , reassuringly			0
" i knew you were just feeling scared			0
" before the day 's second two - hour yoga session in the evening , we climb to the top of @entity33 's main building roof , accompanied by religious chanting and traditional drumming from the local temple during evening prayers			1
the roof is encircled by plants and trees , all enclosed by @entity9 peaks , which gradually fade as the sun sets and night falls			0
evening practice focuses on breathing techniques -- something that sounds simple enough but that we take for granted in everyday life			0
using exercises to ease and open up areas of the chest and back change the way we feel , our posture and allows energy to flow freely through our bodies			0
homegrown produce and ancient treasures after a physically challenging but awakening session , a bell signals dinnertime , accompanied by the chanting of crickets , while guests mingle on the verandah			0
@entity11 provides freshly prepared meals using local produce and has its own well			1
visitors can try @entity33 's homegrown lemons , aloe vera plants and traditional @entity13 neem plant , known for its effective healing properties			1
@entity150 , mango and papaya trees are also on the grounds			0
after a few days of lounging at @entity11 , it 's easy to forget you 're in vibrant @entity13			1
a boat ride in the nearby @entity158 lake , a trip to the @entity161 's residence of @entity162 , where he often gives talks , or a visit to the rock temples of @entity166 , a few hours drive away , are reminders of the diversity outside the retreat 's walls			1
@entity171 will also arrange visits to a local shawl shop , which has beautiful original designs that make the perfect gifts			0
the @entity15 itself is steeped in history			1
" the earliest settlers would have been @entity179 from the @entity180 , evidence of this i have found when the water level recedes and the banks are exposed , " says @entity28			0
treasures he 's uncovered include @entity186 pottery from around 1100 - 800 @entity187 , as well as coins from the @entity190 dynasty through to the @entity191 and @entity192			2
@entity28 's family originates from the @entity194 , but he 's the seventh generation born in @entity13			1
" i 'm a good @entity196 boy ! " he laughs			0
@entity28 built the retreat himself using local laborers and resources			2
sitting on what was originally a corn and winter wheat field , the construction of @entity33 began in 2006			0
today , it embraces the surroundings with wide , open spaces in between the buildings which contain beautifully designed , well appointed rooms			0
getting there the @entity11 retreat is about a three and a half hour drive from @entity212 -- a private car collects visitors from the airport			1
guests can also stay in @entity212 and ask to be picked up from their hotel			0
yoga retreats are held throughout the year , hosted by teachers from around the world who specialize in a variety of styles			2
@entity33 also hosts regular painting , fishing and photography retreats			0
the @entity11 website has the full 2014 schedule .			2
