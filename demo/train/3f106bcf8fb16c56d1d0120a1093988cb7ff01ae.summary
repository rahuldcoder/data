-- the legacy of @entity3 sen. @entity2 , who died on tuesday , spreads far and wide , and across the ocean to now - independent @entity4			1
there , he is still revered for calling attention to what many deemed an unfolding genocide			0
@entity10 sen. @entity2 , known as the " @entity2 , " died tuesday at 77			2
it may have started as a politically prudent move by a @entity14 senator eyeing the @entity15 during a @entity17 regime			0
but @entity2 stood up to the @entity19 administration in 1971 and alerted the world to the bloodshed that was engulfing then - @entity22			1
" in 1971 , there were very few leaders from the so - called free world who were paying any attention to what was going on in @entity4			2
and for @entity2 to come forward and to personally visit , the impact was huge , " said @entity28 , founder and director of @entity4 's @entity30			1
" and that 's one thing @entity4 have always remembered			2
" at the time , the @entity3 policy -- directed by president @entity19 and his national security adviser @entity34 -- was to resolutely support @entity22 , from which @entity4 was trying to secede			1
the administration 's reasons : the @entity37 and @entity38 had just signed a treaty of friendship , and @entity19 was concerned about the expansion of @entity37 influence in the region			2
thus , it made strategic sense for the @entity3 to align itself with @entity38 's neighbor , @entity22			1
the @entity3 turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities committed by the @entity51 army to suppress the independence movement -- even as @entity3 diplomats urged the administration to speak up			1
" our government has failed to denounce the suppression of democracy			0
our government has failed to denounce atrocities , " consul general @entity58 wrote in one of many telegrams from @entity60 to the @entity61 questioning @entity3 policy			1
" but we have chosen not to intervene , even morally , on the grounds that the ... conflict , in which unfortunately the overworked term ' genocide ' is applicable , is purely an internal matter of a sovereign state			0
" the " @entity72 , " as it came to be known , was reclassified as secret , and @entity71 transferred out of @entity60			0
soon after , @entity2 traveled to east @entity38 to gauge the plight of displaced @entity4 -- more than 10 million of whom had sought refuge there			1
on his return , he issued a scathing report to the @entity78 on refugees			2
the report , " crisis in @entity82 , " spoke of " one of the most appalling tides of human misery in modern times			0
" " nothing is more clear , or more easily documented , than the systematic campaign of terror -- and its genocidal consequences -- launched by the @entity51 army on the night of march 25th , " he wrote			1
" all of this has been officially sanctioned , ordered and implemented under martial law from @entity94			0
@entity3 's heavy support of @entity94 is nothing short of complicity in the human and political tragedy of @entity100			0
" the @entity19 administration maintained its stance			0
but @entity2 's focus on the mass killings came as everyday @entity3 began to share in the outrage			1
for instance , beatle @entity107 's @entity106 , the first benefit event of its kind , was staged to further highlight the plight of @entity4 refugees			1
besieged , the @entity113 pushed through a bill to ban arms sales to @entity22			0
on december 16 , 1971 , @entity4 gained independence after a 10 - month struggle , in which 1 million to 3 million @entity118 were killed			0
" when the fighting was over , there were vultures almost too fat to fly , and @entity4 was a land with few of the sinews of nationhood left unsevered , " the @entity119 said in a piece about the birth of the country			0
two months later -- in february 1972 -- @entity2 flew to @entity4 and delivered a speech at @entity130 , where the killing rampage had begun a year earlier			1
about 8,000 jubilant students crowded into the university courtyard and jammed lecture hall balconies and roofs , greeting him with chants of " @entity137 " -- a variation on the independence slogan of " @entity140			0
" in his speech , @entity2 drew parallels between the liberation of @entity4 and the @entity144			1
he said @entity3 had prospered despite predictions that it would collapse following independence , and so would @entity4			2
" even though the @entity3 government does not recognize you , the people of the world do recognize you , " @entity2 told the crowd			2
on the university campus stood a banyan tree where @entity118 student leaders had planted the seeds for the independence movement -- and which the @entity51 army had destroyed as a symbolic gesture			1
during his visit , @entity2 planted a new tree there			0
it still stands today -- a testament to a country that overcame long odds to survive and one man who helped champion it .			0

@entity2 spoke out about @entity4 when @entity3 policy was supporting @entity22
@entity2 visited east @entity38 , then wrote report on displaced @entity4
in report , he *accused* @entity51 army of " systematic campaign of terror "
beatle @entity107 also highlighted refugees ' plight with benefit concert
