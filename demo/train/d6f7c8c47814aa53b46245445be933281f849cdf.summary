it was a shimmering metal wall hanging fashioned from thousands of bottle tops that won @entity3 international acclaim			1
during the @entity7 in 2007 the @entity6 sculptor transformed the facade of a museum by draping one of his exquisite metal tapestries over the top of it , causing a sensation in the art world			1
today , he is hot property , collected by the world 's major museums and selling his rippling metal installations that nod to indigenous art for hundreds of thousands of dollars			2
his latest work goes on display this week at @entity24 's @entity23 , an elevated park built on an old freight rail line in @entity26			1
" @entity32 " will be his largest installation yet -- a 37 - foot - high sculpture made of recycled pressed tin and mirrors woven together with copper wire			1
" the idea of the mirrors is to bring in the landmarks of @entity24 ... to celebrate the achievements of where the work is , " he said			1
the @entity39 is one building reflected in the sculpture			0

he was born in the small town of @entity56 in the @entity57 of @entity6 during @entity59 rule			1
the youngest of 32 children ( on his father 's side ) , his mother died when he was a baby and he was brought up in a @entity65 by his uncle , a presbyterian minister			0
" when you 're living in a @entity68 , you have everything there , you do n't need to go out and therefore you do n't know too much about indigenous society ... i was kind of isolated from it , " he said			0
even as a boy , he knew he wanted to be an artist : " i had a kind of calling			1
" he went on to study @entity76 at the @entity77 in @entity78 , then an " unimaginable " thing to do			0
at that time , only a few years after @entity6 achieved independence from the @entity59 in 1957 , the post-colonial hangover meant @entity3 studied a @entity59 - style curriculum , only covering @entity84 art. read related : @entity87 sculptor @entity86 's painful search for truth he felt strongly that he wanted to know something about his own indigenous culture			1
" having been estranged from it and exposed to art being produced in @entity84 and @entity93 , i was wondering why we did n't have art as well , " he said			0
he remembers coming across a national cultural center in @entity78 and there began to discover @entity6 's " very interesting art forms			1
" they included " adrinka , " a series of ideograms or graphic symbols that represent aphorisms			0
it reminded @entity3 of the @entity84 quest in science during the @entity108 to use symbols to represent abstract concepts			1
the similarity gave him " quite a shock , " and was the catalyst for his exploration of his native culture -- and his attempts to , as he puts it , " indigenize my consciousness			0
" he started using materials from his local environment , recyclables like the bottle caps			0
" a lot of people call them waste , but to me they are not waste ... there are people who collect these things , smash them and make them into utensils like big cooking pots , " he said			2

he says they are meant to act as a reminder that african slaves were exchanged for @entity84 liquor during the transatlantic slave trade			0
while the fluidity of the sculptures are meant to reflect the unsteady relationship between @entity84 , @entity146 and @entity43			2
despite the deep affinity @entity3 has for homegrown @entity130 culture , he resists being called an @entity130 artist			1
" i do n't know any ( artist ) who wants to be geographically categorized only			2
artists want to be known only as artists , " he says			2
he says that when the @entity154 in @entity24 first acquired his art , it was for their @entity156 and only later for their @entity157			1
this " raises so many questions as to what precisely i am -- am i an @entity130 artist or an artist ? " he asks , adding it is high time museums " revisited their categorizations			2
" he adds : " an artist in @entity168 is the same as an artist in @entity146 , @entity6 , @entity171 or @entity43			1
" another thing he does n't want to be prescriptive about is how his work is hung in galleries			0
he sends his work out with no instructions leaving it up to the curators to decide how to install it			0
at first they are confused but eventually they discover " they themselves are also artists , " he says			2
" it 's a versatile form			0
i think an art form should be a replica of life itself -- life is not something which is cut and fixed -- it is constantly changing			0
