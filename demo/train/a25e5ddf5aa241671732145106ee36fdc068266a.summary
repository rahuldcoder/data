the signing of the deal is another major step in the embassy 's plans to relocate from its longtime headquarters in central @entity1 to a new site in @entity15 , on the south bank of the @entity17			1
it was n't immediately clear how much @entity7 @entity19 paid for the embassy building in @entity21 , whose 1960s facade was recently given listed status , meaning its design ca n't be changed			1
the embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017 , the embassy said			1
construction is expected to begin in 2012 or 2013			0
it was a year ago that the embassy announced it was looking for a new site that is more modern , open , and secure than the current building in @entity1 's @entity35			1
it has now settled on a site in @entity15 and is having a design competition for the new building			0
when the embassy does move to @entity15 , it will mark the end of a more than 200 - year association with @entity21 , in the historic and exclusive neighborhood of @entity45 near @entity46			1
@entity47 , who later became @entity49 president , lived on the square from 1785 to 1788 , when he was the first @entity49 minister to the @entity51			2
the building in which he lived still stands in the square 's northeast corner			2

since the september 11 attacks in 2001 , the embassy has caused controversy locally by installing blast walls in a wide perimeter around the building			0
neighbors complained the walls were unsightly , and the walls caused the road in front of the building to be closed to traffic			0
sitting atop the building at the front is a huge gilded aluminum eagle with a 35 - foot wingspan			0
it is not clear whether the eagle will be considered part of the building 's listed status , meaning it will have to stay on the facade , or whether it can be moved to the new location , according to a spokesman for the realty firm @entity109 , which advised the @entity49 on the sale .			1
