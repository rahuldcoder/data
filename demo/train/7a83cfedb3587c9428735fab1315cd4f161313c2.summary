its name means " bending over in pain			2
" it has no treatment or vaccine			1
its symptoms resemble @entity8 fever			0
and it has infected more than 1 million people -- 155 of them fatally -- since spreading to the @entity11 one year ago			1
the mosquito - borne chikungunya virus has long been diagnosed in travelers returning from countries in @entity16 and @entity17 , where the disease is widespread			1
but in december 2013 , the first people infected by mosquitoes local to the region were reported on the @entity23 island of @entity24			1
this was the first outbreak of the debilitating disease in the @entity29 , health officials said			1
all countries in @entity31 have now reported local transmission of @entity33 [ pronounced chik - un - goon - ya ] , and the @entity34 had 11 confirmed cases of local infection this year as of december 12 , all in @entity37			1
there also have been 1,900 imported cases across the @entity34 in returning travelers			0
" it was n't until 2013 that unfortunately a traveler resulted in local transmission of @entity33 , " said @entity41 of the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , referring to the people infected in @entity44			1
those infected carry the virus in their bloodstream ; it can then be picked up by mosquitoes as they bite , making them carriers			1
the virus has since spread rapidly and shows no signs of leaving , as ecological conditions are perfect for the disease to flourish			1
" we knew it would spread , " said @entity58 , a medical epidemiologist			0
the big question perplexing officials : why now ? two mosquito species primed to the temperatures of @entity31 and @entity65 carry @entity33			1
the species -- @entity67 and @entity68 -- also carry the virus behind @entity8			0
" given the level of @entity8 in the region , we knew there could be the same levels of @entity33 , " @entity58 said			1
both diseases can cause joint pain and inflammation , headaches , rashes and fever , and can lead to death in rare cases			1
but this tropical disease with an exotic name ( which originates from the @entity17 @entity86 dialect ) causes more intense joint pain and inflammation			1
for some people the pain can last for months or years , resulting in additional psychological strain			1
the lack of immunity among people living in the @entity11 provided a blank canvas for @entity33 to spread throughout the population this year			1
as of december 12 , more than 1.03 million people have been infected , in addition to the 155 who died , according to the @entity100 ( @entity100 )			1
almost all of the fatalities occurred in the @entity23 island countries of @entity104 and @entity105			0
" where we saw the biggest jump was after it reached the @entity117 - speaking countries in the region , " said @entity58 , referring to the weakened infrastructures and health systems of countries such as the @entity109 , which has reported more than 520,000 cases -- more than half of the overall outbreak and 5 % of the island country 's population			1
as @entity65 countries approach their summer , numbers are expected to rise there as the mosquitoes flourish in the heat			0
" @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 are coming into their summer months and reporting their first local transmission , " @entity58 said			0
already , more than 2,000 people have been infected in @entity125			2
is there cause for concern ? because infection with @entity33 is rarely fatal , the issue of most concern to officials is the burden on health services and the impact of the debilitating symptoms on the economy			1
" the high number of cases can overload health services , " says dr. @entity144 , regional adviser for @entity100 , the regional office of the @entity145			0
until recently , monitoring for @entity33 was not part of routine surveillance in the region			2
" clinicians have to be ready to diagnose , " she said about 20 % to 30 % of cases are expected to become chronic , with symptoms such as arthritis and other rheumatic manifestations leading to physical disabilities , @entity154 said			0
further long - term effects are psychological as people become more depressed and tired			2
all of this can result in missed work and lower school attendance , she said , hurting local economies			0
is it here to stay ? the warm climate of the region offers potential for @entity33 levels to be maintained for years to come , just like @entity8			2
but areas of most concern are the tropics			0
" the areas which have year - round favorable climate for the mosquito are at the greatest risk , " says dr. @entity176 of the @entity177 , which is monitoring the spread of the outbreak			1
while the climate and mosquitos have long been present , @entity154 said , " we do n't know why this is happening now			0
" she said globalization is likely to blame , with increased population movement from one country to another			0
this offers more opportunities for local mosquitos to bite infected humans			0
the @entity42 's @entity58 said she is temporarily at ease regarding numbers in the @entity34 " we 're moving into fall and winter periods , which should see activity decrease , " she said			0
cold temperatures reduce mosquito survival rates			0
the rapid spread of @entity33 this year also could help minimize future infections			1
" @entity33 will go through a region quite rapidly and create a level of population immunity which helps mitigate large outbreaks of the disease , " @entity58 said			2
unlike @entity8 , infection with @entity33 results in lifelong immunity			2
like many other infections , @entity33 could , however , remain in the background through animals capable of carrying the virus in their bloodstream and acting as so - called reservoirs of the disease			1
" in @entity16 and @entity17 there is a transmission cycle in small mammals and monkeys , " @entity154 said , meaning these animals keep the virus present within the population			0
" in the @entity11 ... we do n't know yet			2
" those words -- " we do n't know " -- resonate throughout the community of scientists and government officials trying to control the outbreak			2
the future risk of spread , levels of future immunity , risk from animal reservoirs , why this is only happening now , and the total economic impact are all unknown			0
" mathematical models are under construction by numerous research groups around the world to improve confidence over projections of future spread , " said @entity176 , whose team is modeling the disease			0
as they work , control efforts continue			0
getting it under control when it comes to controlling @entity33 , there are two main strategies -- reduce the likelihood of bites and remove the ever - biting mosquito			1
unlike the mosquitoes behind malaria , which bite at night , the species behind @entity33 bite any time , day or night			2
those living in affected areas are asked to use repellent , sleep under bed nets and wear long clothing to avoid getting bitten			0
the air conditioned and indoor environments of people living in the @entity34 mean numbers are likely to stay low there			0
but mosquito control is at the heart of it all			2
@entity281 spraying of insecticides and removal of any sources of shallow water in which mosquitoes can breed are taking place across the continents			0
according to the @entity42 's @entity58 , @entity37 has been highly aggressive with its approach to control			0
" we 're only at 11 ( cases ) due to such proactive measures , " @entity58 said			0
for now , prevention is all they have as officials wait and see how the outbreak pans out			2
" there is no vaccine currently and no good antivirals , so we are trying to control the spread of the disease , " @entity58 said			1
" there are a lot of questions and only time will tell what we 'll see for @entity33 in the future			2
" debilitating case of mosquito - borne chikungunya in @entity34 mosquito - borne virus chikungunya worries @entity42			1

in 2014 an outbreak of @entity33 has spread across the @entity11
the mosquito - borne virus causes debilitating symptoms such as joint pain
more than 1 million people have been infected and 155 have died
there is no treatment or vaccine , making prevention the main strategy for control
