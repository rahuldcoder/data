-- @entity5 prosecutors will appeal the verdict and the sentence in the @entity9 case , a spokesman for the country 's @entity2 told @entity0 on monday			1
a judge sentenced @entity9 to five years in prison last week after finding the double - amputee track star guilty of culpable homicide , or negligent killing , in the shooting death of his girlfriend , @entity16			2
@entity9 acknowledged shooting @entity16 in february 2013			0
prosecutors claim he wanted to kill her ; @entity9 said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident			2
the appeal does n't necessarily mean either the verdict or the sentence against @entity9 will be thrown out , said @entity0 legal analyst @entity26			1
and it 's even less likely he will be freed at the end of what 's likely to be a six - month process , she said			0
" there 's no real prospect of his acquittal out of this , " she said			0
prosecutors are arguing that judge @entity38 misinterpreted a complex @entity5 standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case , @entity26 said			1
as a result , prosecutors argue , he should not have been convicted on the culpable homicide charge chosen by the judge			0
prosecutors originally took @entity9 to trial on a murder charge			2
in explaining her sentence , @entity38 concluded that @entity9 did not intend to kill @entity16			0
but critics of the verdict have argued the judge did n't correctly apply the intent standard , which is broader in @entity5 law than what it typically means in casual conversation , @entity26 said			1
in their appeal of the sentence , prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by @entity38 is " shockingly inappropriate " in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases , according to @entity26			1
prosecutor @entity64 called for a minimum sentence of 10 years , saying the negligence in @entity9 ' actions " borders on intent			0
" if an appeals court finds that five years is " shockingly inappropriate , " the court could set the sentence aside and issue a new one , she said			1
but appeals courts in @entity5 are reluctant to get involved in sentencing decisions , @entity26 said			1
@entity9 ' uncle , @entity76 , told @entity0 's @entity77 , " we take note of the announcement made by the state			2
the legal process must take its course			0
" @entity0 's @entity83 and @entity84 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 prosecutors to appeal verdict and sentence in the @entity9 case
appeal does n't mean @entity9 is getting out , @entity0 legal analyst @entity26 says
the verdict can be *changed* only if a court rules the judge *misapplied* law , @entity26 says
