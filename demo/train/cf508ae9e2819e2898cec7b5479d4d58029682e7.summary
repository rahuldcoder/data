@entity0 -- broadening the number of health care professionals who can administer vaccine , @entity3 gov. @entity2 issued a sweeping executive order thursday officially declaring a state of emergency due to the increase in @entity12 cases , including 75 @entity12 - related deaths in @entity3			1
the announcement , which comes on the heels of president @entity17 's declaration of @entity12 flu as a national emergency , expands the categories of health care professionals who can give the vaccine to include dentists , pharmacists , podiatrists , midwives and emergency medical technicians , the executive order said			1
at a news conference thursday afternoon , @entity2 stressed that his order is not intended to incite panic but rather allocates the necessary resources to effectively combat @entity12 flu , also known as swine flu			1
" if an enormous number of flu vaccines came into the state because of an epidemic and an emergency and we need to administer them as widely as possible , we have expanded the health care personnel who would be deemed to have the authority to administer the flu vaccine , " @entity2 told reporters			1
under current state law , some health care professionals are prohibited from delivering the vaccine because of limits on their professional duties			2
the governor 's order waives any law that would prevent these people from giving vaccinations , according to @entity56 from the @entity57			0
" it 's called an emergency declaration , but what it does is that it provides @entity3 the capability that once vaccine supplies become more available , it allows ( health departments ) to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible , " @entity56 said			2
dr. @entity67 , a retired dentist who serves as executive director of the @entity69 , which represents 75 percent of the dentists in the state , said he would be more than willing to help administer the vaccine			1

health care professionals named in the executive order may not administer the vaccine at their individual practices			0

@entity0 mayor @entity92 issued a statement thursday supporting @entity2 's order			2
