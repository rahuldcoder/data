@entity0 , @entity1 -- after another marathon session of questioning about everything from their news - watching habits to criminal records , the @entity1 jury that could decide @entity5 's fate started rounding into shape friday			1
by day 's end , eight men and women had made it through various stages of the process at the @entity20 courthouse and were still considered viable candidates to be on the jury in the trial of the @entity1 mother accused of killing her toddler			1
a total of 12 -- plus eight alternates -- will eventually be seated on the jury , which will be moved to and sequestered in @entity29 , where the alleged crime happened and where the trial will take place			1
friday marked the fifth day of jury selection in the case			1
@entity35 , 25 , is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity5			1
she faces six other charges , including aggravated child abuse , aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement			0
jury selection was moved from @entity46 to @entity0 amid concerns that the intense media attention surrounding the case could make it difficult to select an impartial jury in @entity29			1
while the process this week has gone somewhat slower than expected -- as evidenced by the fact court proceedings will likely go through 5 p.m. saturday -- @entity29 superior court chief judge @entity55 said friday that it is imperative to seat a jury as quickly as possible			1
" the cry was pretrial publicity			0
in a free society , i can not stop the press from reporting , broadcasting , and reporting , " said @entity55 , the presiding judge in the case , explaining the need to pick a jury in @entity0 soon , before more potential jurors are swayed by the media coverage			1
" the longer we wait , the more dangers there are			0
" once there are 12 jurors , @entity55 will ask the defense and prosecution teams if they want to use their preemptory challenges -- allowing them , at the judge 's discretion , to disqualify certain men or women from the jury pool			2
if they opt not to use the challenges , jurors can be sworn in			0
the goal is to have everything finalized for opening arguments tuesday in @entity46			0
that would be followed by testimony by investigators , experts and others involved in the case -- including @entity5 's father , mother and brother , who have testified in pretrial hearings			1
but this week , it 's been potential jurors who have been grilled on the stand			1
as they did thursday , defense attorneys asked them whether they 'd be willing to take into account " verbal , emotional or sexual abuse , " should they convict @entity35 and be asked to decide whether to give her the death penalty			0
besides the " history of sexual abuse , " the defense also hinted again friday that @entity35 's " dysfunctional family " might be proposed as a " mitigating circumstance " if she is convicted of murder , as might be " a lack of impulse control or brain development			2
" the comments touched again on the @entity116 's rocky relationship with one another			0
@entity5 made allegations of sex abuse against her father and brother in a letter from jail last year			0
in an interview with @entity130 afterward , her father , @entity35 , denied the claims and criticized @entity132 , another of his daughter 's attorneys , for questioning him about the allegations			2
friday 's questioning also delved into the prospective jurors ' knowledge of the @entity35 case , including what and from where they had heard about it			2
@entity5 was last seen in june 2008			0
police began to look for her a month later after @entity5 -- @entity145 's mother -- made three 911 calls expressing her worry about her granddaughter 's disappearance			0
the girl 's skeletal remains were found in december of that year , in woods about one - quarter mile from the @entity35 home			0
prosecutors have said they plan to show @entity5 lied repeatedly about her daughter 's fate , contending she used " a substance " to kill her daughter			2
@entity5 has pleaded not guilty to the charges			0
the defense has strongly combated the prosecution 's attempts to enter into evidence and hear from an expert claiming that she stashed @entity5 's body in the trunk of her car and dumped it .			1

by day 's end , 16 potential jurors have been selected as viable candidates
a total of 12 , plus 8 alternates , must be picked before @entity5 's trial
the jury selection process will continue saturday , with the trial set for next week
@entity35 is accused of killing her daughter and then lying to investigators
