@entity0 , @entity1 -- shortly after dawn , an open blue wooden fishing boat from @entity4 limped its way into the port of this tiny island , crammed with at least 166 shivering passengers , all of them apparently migrants from @entity12			1
@entity1 coast guard officers and rescue workers helped offload the passengers , wrapping an infant in a metallic blanket and taking at least one man away on a stretcher			1
the passengers left behind husks of bread , soggy blankets , and fluorescent life jackets , scattered in the hull of the boat			2
" i still have the trauma inside me			0
because of the cold , the water			0
because i 've never tried this before in my life , " said a 21 - year old man from @entity31 who only gave his first name @entity33			0
@entity33 said the boat departed from the @entity4 capital of @entity38 on thursday morning and reached this tiny @entity1 island after a perilous 24 - hour journey			1
the boat was just the first of five boats that arrived friday carrying 1,271 passengers			1
on saturday , two more boats carrying more than 400 people from @entity4 and @entity50 reached the island , the @entity46 high commissioner for @entity47 said			1
most of the refugees are from @entity12 , including @entity31 and @entity54			0
there are also @entity56 , some @entity57 and @entity50			0
" the sea is really difficult ... i vomited so much , " said @entity59 , 26 , also from @entity31			2
despite reports that a similar ship sank off the coast of @entity4 , killing at least 16 migrants , more than 30,000 migrants and refugees from @entity50 and @entity4 have risked this dangerous journey to @entity0 since last february			1
late thursday night , @entity1 authorities were tracking one boat from @entity4 carrying 250 migrants that was said to be leaking			1
that vessel is believed to now be in the territorial waters of @entity71			0
passengers onboard friday morning 's boat said they made the journey to escape the fighting in @entity4			2
" it 's a war situation now , " @entity33 said			0
that 's why we have to run for our lives			0
we are not secure in that country			0
" @entity59 huddled on the pavement of the port , eating a biscuit distributed by @entity1 emergency workers			1
" we are now refugees in @entity1 , " @entity59 said			2
" the @entity1 government and the @entity87 should do something to help us			2
" the armada of leaky boats full of migrants that have flooded @entity0 over the past three months has become a hot - button political issue both in @entity1 and the @entity87			1
a diplomatic spat erupted recently when @entity95 prevented a train carrying dozens of @entity50 migrants from crossing the border from @entity1			2
meanwhile , this week , the @entity100 government announced it would begin checking passports at the border of @entity100			0
these measures threaten to undermine the @entity105 agreement , which allows free movement across @entity108 borders			0
one unexpected consequence of the revolutions that have swept through @entity111 is the collapse of border controls in @entity50 and @entity4			0
@entity0 and @entity71 , both islands less than an hour 's flight from the @entity111 coast , have borne the brunt of the subsequent wave of migration			1
at one point , the population of migrants vastly outnumbered the tiny population of @entity0 , which numbers less than 6,000			2
migrants slept in the streets of this small fishing port			0
dozens of blue fishing boats from @entity50 and @entity4 are piled up in a boat graveyard outside @entity0 's small commercial port			1
nearby , graffiti on a wall says " @entity134 , " meaning , " enough , we are full			0
" today , the number of new arrivals from @entity50 has reduced somewhat , thanks in part to a recent agreement with @entity1 to improve patrolling along the @entity50 coast			1
but as the war rages on in @entity4 , the number of barely seaworthy vessels departing @entity38 for @entity108 has increased drastically			0
a local priest is planning to hold a memorial service in @entity0 later friday for three other migrants who washed up on the shore of this small @entity151 island last sunday			1
the boat they are believed to have traveled on lies on its side on the rocky shore of @entity0 days after it ran aground .			1

new : more than 1,250 have arrived by sea
four boats make it to the island *safely*
" some people were in coma , " one refugee says of the boat ride to @entity0
@entity1 coast guard officers and rescue workers help offload the passengers
