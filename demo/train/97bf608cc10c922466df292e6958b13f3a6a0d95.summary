the @entity0 started off as a penniless @entity2 joke			1
but @entity3 plans on selling his vacation home for this meme - inspired currency			1
the 27 - year - old entrepreneur has been selling games and gadgets over the internet for years , but nothing as big as his @entity12 vacation home , which he is offering for 100 million @entity13			1
@entity0 ( pronounced @entity14 ) is n't something tangible like the dollar bills in your wallet			1
it 's an open source file - sharing form of cryptocurrency that was created by programmer @entity21 in december 2013			0
the newbie cryptocurrency started off as a parody of @entity24 , using the image of a perplexed @entity27 dog			1
chances are , you 've probably seen @entity0 's mascot somewhere on the internet already			1
as the @entity32 would say : wow , much coin - cidence			2
but this satirical currency is n't just a punchline anymore			0
through trading and transactions between users , the currency went from being worth nothing to being valued at more than $ 65 million , and it has a uniquely supportive community of users from the site @entity44			1
@entity3 , a user of @entity45 since 2011 , started buying and selling @entity46 two days after they were made available online			2
but the early adopter did n't think of selling his vacation home for cryptocurrency until his property got no offers after several months on the market			1
his three - bedroom , two - bath home is one of 2,300 properties on sale in @entity57 , in the state 's northern woods			2
to attract potential buyers , he decided to accept @entity61 as a payment form			0
he sees potential in it			0
" i do n't mind holding on to ( @entity46 ) for a multitude of reasons , including that i believe i can use them to further my business , " he explained			0
@entity3 , who lives in @entity69 , primarily sells video and electronic game accessories online			0
he 's been able to buy and sell inventory from places such as @entity74 by using the digital currency			2
" it 's safe and easy with minimal fees , " he said			0
" to date , i 've found it to be very good for supplementing payment methods			0
" @entity80 , who has written about cryptocurrency for the @entity82 , says @entity0 can be a feasible alternative to @entity24 , but it is important to put it into context			1
@entity24 is the most popularly traded cryptocurrency and has the largest community of users in the digital currency realm			1
@entity0 is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies , but it has a far smaller following			1
@entity93 of the @entity94 -- yes , the founders even established a nonprofit organization -- says what makes it special compared with its competitors is its community			0
" it was important to the founders that the currency would be friendly and accepting			0
most of these @entity24 competitors are created to make a lot of money , but it 's hard to generate a healthy supportive community , " he said			1
@entity93 estimates that more than 100,000 people use @entity0 actively			1
that does make for a limited pool of users who can fork up @entity3 's 100 million @entity0 price tag , which translates to roughly $ 135,000			1
the value of a @entity0 is about one - tenth of a penny , whereas a @entity24 is valued at a hefty $ 630 -- and at their peak @entity45 were trading at $ 1,200			1
bitcoin prices plunge as technical problems persist even though the value of @entity0 is only a fraction of other cryptocurrenices , that does n't mean it 's easy to earn			1
there 's a process , says @entity0 user @entity129 , who first shared @entity3 's story with @entity131			1
the @entity133 resident explained that people use graphic cards and their computers to help " mine " @entity13			0
( in doge - ism speak , it 's called " digging " for coins			0
) mining is the process used to create digital currencies -- it 's where computers solve mathematical equations in exchange for @entity13			2
it 's similar to producing other popular cryptocurrencies such as @entity24 , @entity151 and @entity152			1
@entity0 even has its own website , which has step - by - step instructions on how to get started using the currency			1
it also features a flashy introductory video of an animated @entity32 flying through a fictional city on a rocket ship			0
the @entity0 community is doing more than just joking around and financing online shopping sprees			1
the currency is being used to raise money for events and people			0
before the @entity166 kicked off , @entity0 fundraisers helped send the @entity168 bobsled team and an @entity170 luge contender to @entity171 to compete in the @entity172			2
the @entity94 and @entity44 's r / @entity0 community were able to raise more than $ 30,000 for the two causes			1
bitcoin regulations coming this year despite the @entity0 community 's generosity , @entity3 says the cryptocurrency has its critics			2
" so many people , especially people involved with @entity24 , tend to believe it 's a copycat			2
i really do n't think you can be so shortsighted			0
i believe the value of an economic system is the sum of all of its parts			0
so , there is room for all sorts of coins , " he said			0
@entity21 , the creator of @entity0 , explains that the currency is not meant to be a rival to @entity24			1
both use the same technology			0
" @entity0 would n't be where it is without @entity24 leading the way , " said the @entity196 , @entity197 , resident			1
" @entity24 is the trailblazer and @entity0 is a friendly spin that helps introduce the world of cryptocurrency			1
" @entity0 's longevity is also dependent on network effect , @entity80 explains			2
" @entity0 is sort of this self - fulfilling prophecy , " he said			2
" the more people who accept it , the more value it has			0
@entity45 has a head start on that , " he said			0
@entity45 has been around for five years whereas @entity0 has been in circulation for three months			2
with the cryptocurrency still in its infancy and only a fraction of the value of its popular counterparts , it begs the question : has @entity3 received any offers for his six - acre vacation home ? not yet , he says			1
but he 's definitely made an impression with the @entity0 community			2
" i 've been asked a lot of questions about this house , and i think it 's a good effect			0
it gets more people talking , " he said			0
@entity94 's @entity93 says all the chatter is a good thing for the digital currency			0
" the @entity234 dollar is only valuable because people are willing to accept it			0
in currency , that is the most important thing , " he said			0
" @entity0 's priorities are ' let 's get everyone to the moon , ' " @entity93 said			2
" @entity244 is really powerful and instead of locking it up for a few people , let 's get everyone in the world on it			0

after failing to get any offers , a man says he *'ll* take @entity252 for his vacation home
@entity0 is an alternative digital coin to the popularly traded @entity24
although it started off as a parody to @entity24 , @entity0 is now worth more than $ 65 million
