-- on a day when global doomsday predictions failed to pan out , @entity1 had more good news for the @entity4 : an asteroid feared to be on a collision course with our planet no longer poses a threat			1
uncertainties about the orbit of the asteroid , known as 2011 @entity12 , previously allowed for a less than a 1 % chance it would hit the @entity4 in february 2040 , @entity1 said			1
to narrow down the asteroid 's future course , @entity1 put out a call for more observation			1
astronomers from the @entity20 at @entity21 took up the task and managed to observe the asteroid over several days in october			2
" an analysis of the new data conducted by @entity1 's @entity25 at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity28 , shows that the risk of collision in 2040 has been eliminated , " @entity1 declared friday			1
the new observations , made with the gemini 8 - meter telescope in @entity33 , @entity34 , reduce the orbit uncertainties by more than a factor of 60			2
that means the @entity4 's position in february 2040 is not in range of the asteroid 's possible future paths			1
the asteroid , which is 140 meters ( 460 feet ) in diameter , will get no closer to @entity4 than 890,000 kilometers ( 553,000 miles ) , or more than twice the distance to the moon , @entity1 said			1
a collision with @entity4 would have released about 100 megatons of energy , several thousand times more powerful than the atomic bombs that ended @entity50 , according to the @entity51			1
observing the asteroid was n't easy , said @entity52 , an astronomer at the @entity53			1
the asteroid 's position was very close to the sun , so astronomers had to observe it when the sky was dark			2
@entity52 told @entity0 there was about a half - hour between when the asteroid got high enough in the sky for the telescope to point at it and before the sky became too light to observe it			0
because the astronomers were looking at the asteroid low in the sky , they were viewing it through a lot of atmosphere , which scattered some of the light and made the object fainter , he said			2
" the second effect is the turbulence of the atmosphere makes things fainter , " @entity52 said			0
" we had to keep trying over and over until we got one of those nights when the atmosphere was calm			0
" @entity52 and the team also discovered the asteroid is elongated , so that as it rotates , its brightness changes			0
that was another challenge for the astronomers : because they did n't know the asteroid 's rotation period , they did n't know when it would wax and wane , and when it would grow too faint to see			1
" this object was changing its brightness by a factor of three or four -- it was just enormously variable , " @entity52 said			0
" it was hit and miss depending on which night you observed it			0
" many predicted the end of the world would come friday , the day on which a long phase in the ancient @entity102 calendar came to an end			0
some believe the day actually comes sunday			0
modern - day @entity109 say the end of the calendar phase does n't mean the @entity112 -- just the end of an era , and the start of a new one			0
@entity1 estimates 4,700 ' potentially hazardous ' asteroids			0

the asteroid previously had a *0.2* % chance of hitting the @entity4
more observation by astronomers in @entity34 shows no risk of collision
a collision would have released about 100 megatons of energy
observing the asteroid was n't easy
