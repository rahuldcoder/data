@entity0 -- @entity4 's prime minister held his first meeting thursday night with leaders of @entity7 , a loose coalition of various groups of demonstrators from @entity10 , platform leader @entity2 said			1
the meeting came after 24 hours of calm in @entity0 and followed a wednesday evening gathering between the prime minister and a group of individuals attempting to act as mediators for the protesters in @entity10			1
earlier , the prime minister called on protesters camped out in the park to pack up and leave			1
" we are running out of patience , " @entity22 told members of his party in the capital , @entity26 , on thursday			1
" i am making this warning for one last time			2
" the government has been delivering conflicting messages			2
on the one hand , it appeared to slightly soften its stance by saying it would hold a referendum on @entity10 's fate , but at the same time , the government delivered yet another ultimatum thursday for the demonstrators to evacuate			1
@entity22 intensified his heated rhetoric , at times pushing into the absurd			1
@entity10 reeks , making it high time for police to clear it out , @entity22 said			1
" it stinks of pee			2
in fact , some of them even poo in there			2
" he lashed out at rowdy demonstrators , whom he called " vagabonds " and " thugs			2
" but he also told peaceful protesters they need not complain about the actions of his police , because they had put themselves in the line of tear gas fire by associating with the wrong people and illegal groups			1
" where dry wood is burning , fresh wood will also burn unnecessarily , " @entity22 said			1
he vowed to continue routing out rowdies and ordered peaceful protesters out of the park , asking them to leave police alone with " illegal groups			1
" " come forward , mothers , fathers , please , claim your children			2
let those children withdraw from that area , " he said			0
" we are on the one hand waiting for the judiciary process			0
on the other hand , we would take a step towards a plebiscite and we 'll follow whatever @entity0 people decide			0
" but please own up to your children , take them out , " he continued			0
" otherwise we can not wait any longer , because @entity10 does not belong to occupation forces ; @entity10 belongs to @entity0 people and the whole nation			0
" @entity22 's party has organized counterprotests for the weekend to give a voice to @entity4 's " quiet majority to the people and the world , " he said			1
they will show the international community " a real , true picture of @entity4			0
" two rallies will be held away from anti-government protests to avoid possible confrontations , he said			0
negotiations on wednesday , the prime minister met with protest mediators for four and a half hours , but some leaders , such as with the @entity7 , one of the main protest groups , backed out because of what it described as heavy - handed police measures tuesday night in the square			1
but on thursday night , leaders of @entity7 were heading to meet with the prime minister in @entity26			1
@entity112 actions against protesters could strain @entity22 's strategic friendships with much of the @entity115 -- relationships that are particularly critical in light of the civil war ravaging @entity4 's neighbor , @entity120			1
@entity4 is a @entity121 ally with a democratically elected government			0
opinion : past and future collide in @entity4 clashes the @entity127 protests show no sign of abating			0
what began in late may as a demonstration focused on the environment -- opposition to a plan to build a mall in @entity10 -- has evolved into a wider protest against @entity22 that 's spread around the country			1
letters from @entity4 , with pride international criticism @entity22 also dealt a slap to the @entity142 for a resolution it passed thursday condemning his country 's police crackdown on protesters and the suppression of opposition voices			1
" the @entity151 's decisions about us , i am not recognizing those decisions , " he said			1
the comments triggered a thunderous standing ovation and roaring cheers from party members			0
" how dare you make such decisions about my country ? " his angry words were echoed by foreign minister @entity162 , who said the @entity151 had no right to censure @entity4 if it did n't do the same when other @entity165 nations tackled protests in similar ways			1
for example , he said , water cannons and tear gas were used by @entity172 security forces at an occupy protest in @entity174 on june 1 , the same day as they were deployed in @entity4 , without drawing criticism			0
" @entity4 will always support the freedom of demonstration ... but if this is misused , we distinguish between the innocent demonstrators and the marginal groups who try to misuse the right of demonstration , " he said			0
he accused some people of trying to damage @entity4 's image in the eyes of the world			2
@entity4 has for many years expressed the desire to become a member of the @entity142			2
experts and human rights groups say @entity22 's government lags when it comes to human rights and freedom of expression by opponents			1
" prosecutors and courts continued to use terrorism laws to prosecute and prolong incarceration of thousands of @entity206 political activists , human rights defenders , students , journalists and trade unionists , " @entity199 wrote in a 2013 report on @entity4			0
@entity4 journalists are afraid to write anything critical of the government , and media companies are slapped with huge tax fines for covering uncomfortable topics			0
according to the @entity218 , @entity4 authorities have targeted journalists with detention for covering the protests			0
the prime minister has said many times he will not back down			1
on wednesday evening , @entity225 police took two foreign nationals into custody on grounds that they resisted police , according to the @entity231 and @entity232 official website			2
it was reported that the two men were journalists working for a @entity236 television and covering the protests in @entity225			0
on thursday , the @entity239 @entity238 in @entity26 issued a security message to @entity239 visitors , highlighting a risk of terrorist attacks on @entity239 diplomatic , consular and military facilities in @entity4			0
" the @entity239 @entity238 has received an increased number of reports indicating terrorist organizations are targeting these facilities , " the advisory said			0
it said @entity239 diplomatic facilities will remain open for business " in the absence of specific and credible threat information that can not be otherwise countered			0
" what 's driving unrest and protests in @entity4 ? @entity1 's @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity262 reported from @entity0 ; @entity263 , @entity264 and @entity265 reported from @entity266			2
@entity267 reported from @entity268 .			0
