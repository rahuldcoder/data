the holidays are officially over for @entity2 -- the @entity4 racer has started his new job with @entity6			1
the 27 - year - old is driving into the unknown after ending his rewarding relationship with @entity10 , which powered him to four straight world titles and 44 grand prix victories			2

it will take to the track for the first preseason test in @entity50 , @entity51 during the first four days of february			0
but there wo n't be a @entity53 on @entity2 's chassis -- that honor will go to @entity57 rival @entity56 , now a double world champion -- and instead @entity2 will race under the @entity59			1

@entity6 failed to win a race in 2014 for the first time since 1993 and finished fourth in the constructor standings			0
@entity29 , who was the third man to occupy the position of @entity6 team principal in 2014 , has set @entity2 and his teammate @entity70 a target of at least two race victories in the coming season			1
" @entity2 brings with him the experience of winning , " @entity29 , who joined from @entity76 tobacco company @entity74 , said at a media conference in december			0
