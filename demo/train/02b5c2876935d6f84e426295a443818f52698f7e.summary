-- on monday , news broke that about 200 girls had been kidnapped from their school in @entity4 , in the northeastern state of @entity6 -- a region at the center of @entity10 's five - year terrorist insurgency			1
the very next day , the @entity10 military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued			1
this turned out to be untrue			0
the school 's principal and the girls ' parents complained that the girls were still missing			2
in august last year , a military spokesman announced the death of @entity21 , the leader of @entity23 extremist group @entity22 , at the hands of the military			1
but like the news of the release of the schoolgirls , it proved to be fiction			0
' misleading sources ' incidents like this have come to shape the way the military is perceived in the wildly unpredictable battle against @entity22			1
posts on the military 's social media accounts regularly boast of " smoking out " or ambushing terrorists or recovering weapons -- often written in way that brings to mind @entity44 's infamous former information minister under @entity45 , dubbed " @entity46 , " who claimed coalition forces were in retreat even as @entity50 tanks rolled almost unchallenged across the country in 2003			1
like him they 've also ended up pinning the blame for inaccurate reporting on " misleading " sources			1
even when there is truth to its narratives -- and there have been major successes , including a crackdown that started in early 2013 that killed several top @entity65 commanders and driven others across the border into @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 -- the triumphalism seems odd when juxtaposed with the harsh reality of events like the @entity4 abduction , or the one at another government school in neighboring @entity75 in february , in which more than fifty schoolboys were murdered in their dormitories , with nary a soldier in sight until several hours later			2
perhaps the military resorts to this impulsively buoyant tone because it believes it can not afford to sound anything otherwise			2
or perhaps it 's simply because it can get away with it -- because the @entity10 authorities have a long and remarkable history of getting away with anything they say			1
that tenuous relationship with fact makes it relatively easy for senior government officials to publicly dispute government finances to the tune of billions of dollars ; and for an assortment of newspaper headlines to display wildly differing casualty figures the morning after a bombing incident			0
death ' cheap and plentiful ' and then there 's the scale of @entity10 's tragedies			1
for a country that is not at war , death is cheap and plentiful			0
so cheap and so sweeping in its audacity that @entity10 readily make jokes about it			1
that might help explain the trademark blunted edge of @entity10 outrage			1
if it happens often enough , the mind is soon inured , and eagerly accepting of the sense of resignation that might offer the best protection against the emotional impact of the next cycle of negative breaking news			0
all of the above combine to create the context in which the @entity10 military -- wielding political power for 29 of @entity10 's first 39 years after independence -- has learned to operate			1
not since the civil war , almost 50 years ago , has it been tested this much			0
the closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in @entity131 and @entity132 , in which it played a prominent role at the head of the @entity136 , intended more as a " peacekeeping " unit than a combat force			0
indeed what we are seeing may be evidence of its struggle to adapt to new rules of engagement , fighting an enemy driven by convictions much deeper than those displayed by the pro-democracy activists and diamond - obsessed rebels it contended with in the 1990s ; possessing access to sophisticated weapons , and operating in terrain far better suited to insurgents than conventional armies			0
abuse claims the increasing militarization of the troubled zones has since spurred accusations of human rights abuses , from local and international observers			0
an @entity164 report from april 2014 has called for an end to the use of " heavy - handed military and police methods that risk pushing yet more restless , jobless and frustrated youths into violence and extremism			2
" communication strategies also require overhaul			0
in the age of social media , the military needs to realize that propaganda is now a lot more likely to be found out and discredited			0
news reports suggest that the military , long hampered by aging hardware , is now acquiring new weapons and equipment			0
in a country where institutional graft is the rule and not the exception , it is crucial to ensure that the military budgets are spent to boost the military 's capability , and troops ' morale -- and not pocketed by bigwigs			2
international cooperation also needs to be stepped up ; and it does seem that the government is now more willing than ever to work with @entity199 and @entity50			0
@entity10 have long been wary of allowing the @entity50 military the sort of foothold it has in countries like @entity204 and @entity205 , but there 's certainly room for more intense cooperation that does not involve abdicating total control			1
finally the military will need to prepare to adapt itself to the reality of the government 's planned shift to a " soft " counter-terrorism strategy , embodied in a document unveiled by @entity217 , @entity218 , a retired @entity220 colonel , in march			2
amid the backlash it has faced recently , the beleaguered military can count on the support of a growing number of @entity10 , who think that it is being under appreciated for the work it is doing			1
just this week a " support the @entity230 " page launched on @entity229 , in honor of " our military men and women on the field who risk their lives daily to keep us safe			0

@entity239 : @entity10 's military has issued *incorrect* statements in fight against extremists
often blame their inaccurate reporting on " misleading sources , " he says
@entity239 says the military may be trying to paint a *constantly* *positive* picture
@entity239 says it has had some successes in its five - year war with @entity23 extremists
