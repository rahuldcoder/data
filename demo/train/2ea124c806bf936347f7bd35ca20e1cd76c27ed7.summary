@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a bitterly cold december morning in 2011 , we watched as the last @entity5 troops crossed the border into @entity7 , ending @entity5 's war in @entity1			1
more than 100 vehicles were in that convoy , snaking its way across the desert and through the floodlit border crossing , leaving behind empty bases and memories of nearly 4,500 @entity5 lives that were lost			0
@entity5 breathed a sigh of relief			0
many @entity1 held their breath			2
@entity21 , they feared , was far from over for them , and time has borne out their fears			0
the death and violence never stopped -- it 's just that the bombs and bullets faded from @entity5 minds and television screens once the pull - out was complete			2
two years later we 're back in @entity1 and things are in many ways worse for @entity1 than when the @entity5 left			1

we were reminded this was done for the 2012 @entity50 in @entity0 , not for general " beautification			0
" those of us who 'd been to @entity0 on multiple assignments were struck by the ubiquitous security presence -- police checkpoints and posts and army units on duty in some places			0
the traffic was always bad in @entity0			0
today , it 's worse that we can remember			2
locals talk of almost becoming accustomed to the threat of not coming home at night because of some random car bomb			0

the groundwork for today 's problems began almost as soon as that last @entity5 convoy left in 2011			2
@entity79 lawmakers protested the rounding up of many of their aides and security guards , and the country 's vice president -- top @entity79 leader @entity83 -- faced arrest and later fled the country			1
the government of prime minister @entity88 was supposed to usher in a political era of inclusion and reconciliation			1
his critics say those first days after the @entity5 departure were a signal of opposite intentions that have continued to this day			2
the @entity79 minority that had ruled @entity1 via the iron fist of @entity99 was at the political and social mercy of @entity88 's @entity103 - dominated government			1
today , they say , " inclusiveness " never materialized , @entity79 have been marginalized and resentment has festered in a divide - and - conquer political climate			1
as one local put it , " it 's like if you 're against us , you 're a terrorist and we 'll arrest you			0
" why @entity1 is in turmoil this resentment , aided by the violent government shutdown of @entity79 protest camps , provided an opening for the @entity118 - linked @entity117 ( @entity117 ) to move into the @entity79 heartland of @entity120 in force			1
@entity118 is a beast that feasts on discontent and in @entity120 there is no shortage of sustenance			2
a previous version of @entity117 , the @entity117 , comprised the core insurgents the @entity5 fought in those cities during the war			0
they have regrouped and strengthened across the border in @entity132 during that country 's bloody conflict -- and extended their fight for a home for their brand of hard - line @entity138 into @entity1			1
the results have been deadly -- not just in @entity140 and @entity141 of course , but across the country , where , just like the " bad old days " of 2005 - 2009 , bombings and killings have become pretty much daily events			0
read more : at least 60 killed in @entity120 since december 1 in 2006 the @entity5 convinced -- and paid -- @entity79 tribal and religious leaders to fight the hardliners , with great success			1
but @entity79 grievances never went away and some in @entity120 see @entity117 as comrades - in - arms against an @entity88 government viewed as an oppressor of @entity79			1
other @entity79 see @entity88 as the lesser of two evils -- they do n't like how they 're treated , but like even less the @entity117 brand of hard - line , brutal " governance "			1
@entity88 has more than once termed the various fights and stand - offs in @entity140 and @entity141 as a fight against " @entity118 " , but it 's not that simple			1
the @entity79 sense of being under the heel of a sectarian government , of being cut out of the running of their country , failing to share in growing oil revenues , has nothing to do with @entity118 and wo n't evaporate once @entity117 is forced from @entity140 and @entity141			2
the @entity5 are n't coming back to help out with boots on the ground , but they are giving other support -- offering drones , missiles , aircraft and other assistance			0
but this is n't a battle to be won militarily			0
sunnis -- many of whom have yet to get used to no longer running the country -- say they want to be part of the system that was meant to be " inclusive " but has , they feel , been anything but			0

@entity2 's @entity193 says things are in many ways worse for @entity1 now than in 2011
security situation in @entity79 - dominated @entity120 province has *deteriorated* in recent days
critics say @entity1 prime minister @entity88 's @entity103 government has marginalized @entity79
