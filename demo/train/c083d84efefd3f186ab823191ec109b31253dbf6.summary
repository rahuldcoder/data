-- @entity1 is known as an iron man on the tennis tour but even he gets tired			1
after long semifinal matches in @entity6 in 2008 , @entity7 in 2009 and at the @entity8 in @entity9 in 2010 , fatigue likely played a factor in the @entity11 losing the next day			0
@entity1 was on court for nearly three hours on saturday against @entity13 at the inaugural @entity14 but this time he recovered to win the finale , defeating tricky @entity17 @entity16 63 76 ( 3 ) for a 43rd title on clay and 62nd overall			1
the latter tally placed him in a tie for seventh with @entity23			0
it was @entity1 's first tournament since the @entity26 , having skipped @entity27 last week with the back complaint that surfaced in the @entity30 final against @entity32 's @entity31			1
" @entity13 played a great match , playing very aggressive , " @entity1 told the @entity34 's website			1
" i played too short and i gave him the chance to have control of the point			0
" today i was able to play with a little bit more calm , play a little bit longer and go a little bit more for the points			0
i played a more solid match			0
" @entity16 likely needed a good start to upset the so - called ' @entity1 ' but instead trailed 4 - 1 in about 20 minutes			1
having never broken @entity1 in four previous matches , there seemed to be no hope for the world no. 54 when the 13 - time grand slam winner tried to serve out proceedings in the second set			1
however , @entity1 faltered and was forced into a tiebreak			2
on this occasion , it was more straightforward than on saturday , when he saved a pair of match points against countryman @entity13			0
@entity16 -- who stunned @entity58 finalist @entity57 in the semifinals -- struck a double fault early and was unable to engineer another comeback			2
" as usual , he was spinning his forehand , making a lot of trouble to hit flat and i could n't really get used to his serve much , only at the end of the match , " @entity16 said			2
" but i 'm quite happy with the week			0

@entity1 sees off @entity16 to win the inaugural @entity14
